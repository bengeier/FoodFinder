{"text":"Brilliant Just Brilliant. This is not just a restaurant it is a gastronomic experience. The Gauchos are exceptional. Thank You for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I celebrated Brazil's Independence day, and i was very happy to get guarana soda. The meat was excellent, and cooked to perfection. I Like this Location better than the one in San Diego."}
{"text":"Go HUNGRY! I've been here a few times and always had a great experience. Well worth The price. The salad bar is delish. Service is impeccable. The food is delicious, love the palenta! I will definitely go back. I had a great dinning experienced overall."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Fogo fan and have visited locations in various countries. The Scottsdale restaurant is pretty solid. When busy, the service can be a bit inattentive, and the premium cuts don't come around that often so be sure to ask! Overall, a fun restaurant with a great atmosphere. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience, very accommodating. Have been to several Brazilian style restaurants and this is by far my favorite. From the bread to the atmosphere to the seasoning of the meat they just are on point. Will be back soon enough."}
{"text":"We drive all the way from Casa Grande to Fogo.   We love how the service is.  We love the food.  And we love seeing Marco.   We have been going to Fogo since Marco was serving meats and now he is a manager and it is so awesome to watch him take care of people.  This restaurant has a amazing salad bar,  delish bread,  and yummy meats.  Go hungry it is not a place for picky eaters or people who don't eat in general.   The drinks are good quality,  and the selections of wine are superb.   It is easy to drop 200+ for 2 people.  But it is all worth it.  NOTE to Fogo... DON'T lose Marco!!!!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here and gorging myself on amazing meats. If you've never been, be prepared so spend quite a bit of money and feel incredibly stuffed afterwards. Always come on an empty stomach to get the most out of it. Also, 21+ if you've never had a caipirinha, it's like a sugary mojito and very addicting!"}
{"text":"Sadly this 2 star review is in comparison to Texas de brazil. The atmosphere is quite empty and bland. Their meats are dry and unseasoned. Their salad bar is mediocre. The service is really nothing to speak of. For the same price, you can experience the ridizio in a better atmosphere, with better food and service at Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"Terrible experience and food! Our server was terrible!!! He barely attended to us. I go to the one in Beverly Hills all the time and the quality of neat there and the cook tastes way different. This particular Fogo couldn't even get the cheese breads correctly."}
{"text":"We thought we would try this place since we were celebrating my husbands birthday and we LOVE the Churrascaria in San Francisco! Food was delicious and I'm Only giving this place 4 stars since it fell Short of a few items from SF. If you want prawns it's extra and the buffet bar was limited on options compared to our go to place. Other than that Service was amazing!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in few years. My first experience was amazing. Tonight, I left feeling very underwhelmed. The service was great, don't get me wrong...quality wasn't there and price did not match what you would expect to get for $50 a person."}
{"text":"We went to Fogo for the first time to celebrate my husband's birthday after it was suggested by a friend. The experience was fantastic!  The service was the perfect blend of attentive and not bugging us. If we needed something, someone was there to get it for us.   The food was delicious. The meat was obviously the star at Fogo, but the salad bar was the best I've ever had... a lot of variety with a little something for every taste."}
{"text":"Would have been 5 stars, but I'm annoyed at the $45 per bottle corkage fee for the excellent wines that we brought with us. That's the highest fee I've ever encountered by far. It's nearly as much as the dinner itself.  OK, that complaint aside, this is a very nice restaurant. Service was excellent. The salad bar was better than average and had a huge variety. The starchy side dishes like bananas and potatoes were brought to the table separately and seemed a little skimpy for our party of six. The meats were numerous and frequent. Many of them were excellent - a few were ordinary. And I got a bite of lamb that was vile, sort of fishy in taste. A nibble on another part of the same cut tasted OK, though. Weird.   We came to this restaurant because we wanted a long, leisurely meal with a bunch of good meat to pair with the good cabernets and pinot. And that's what we got. Maybe we'll go again, and order craft beer, because I don't want to feel resentful about their wine policies again."}
{"text":"Great food and service. For the price, I would have expected dessert selections included. Also the $22 shrimp cocktail and $15 cocktail were a bit over priced."}
{"text":"I tried Fogo de Chao for the first time while in Atlanta a few years ago, and always wanted to come back. When I found out that there was one in Scottsdale, I got really excited and decided to go there for dinner. It was just as delicious as I remembered, in fact, I enjoyed the experience even more this time around. I love the all-you-can-drink Limeades! The attentiveness of the staff can't be beat: they constantly checked on us to make sure our drinks were refilled and that we have enough food. The assorted grilled meats were all very tasty and the salad bar with all the different sides was yummy too. We inhaled the Tres Leches we ordered for dessert. Overall, this was a perfect, satisfying meal: great food, awesome customer service."}
{"text":"BE AWARE! HONOR MISTAKES ??????????  We visited Fogo De Chao in Scottsdale AZ on August 6, 2016. We had 3 adults, 1 kid and 3 drinks which is about a $218.00 dollars charge (total bill's around $180 plus tip). On August 9, 2016, I checked my bank statement and my credit card got charges $418.00 dollars. They overcharged me $200.00 dollars.  I called the manager attention to the overcharge and instead of apologizing, he told me how it had never happened that before. Then, it was said that the tip mistake.     Is it really a mistake?"}
{"text":"This was my second trip to this location and I noticed their salad bar had fewer items from before.  It was still very good but am disappointed that they seemed to have eliminated some items. I am not a big meat eater and came for the salad bar so I noticed these things. It was still really really good however."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Meat. MORE OF WHATEVER THAT LAST ONE WAS, PLEASE! Staff is ON IT! If beef was grass fed and fish was wild, it would be five star worthy. :) Applause to you, Fogo de Chao"}
{"text":"This particular location is really nice and fancy. But I mean.. it is Scottsdale. It was my first time eating here and only knew what to expect from what friends had mentioned.   The salad bar is fully stocked with everything you may want on a salad. Its a lot of food and I was told to pace myself so I didn't get full before the meats. I enjoyed two plates of salad and was very satisfied with their selection.   The endless meats were good. The portions are small so it keeps you from over eating. Personally I thought they could be better seasoned but they were still good. The only issue was that all the servers came at once so it was easy to get overwhelmed on the meats and end up getting full faster. I asked for well done and most skewers on hand are not necessarily well cooked. When I was brought a well done piece of meat it was burnt and I didn't end up liking it.   A small bottled Coke was $3 with obviously no refills. This I can do without. Buffets should give free refills! I didn't know the pricing before coming in. Had I known it would be $115 for two people, I probably would have reconsider. It was good, the service is decent (my main server never came back), the food is delicious, like I said the salad bar was beyond what I expected. With cheese and meats plus different types of salad mix, it was really good. The meats were good.. not amazing, but good. Was it all worth $55? I don't know yet.   I'd probably come back now that I know what to expect. I'll probably starve myself all morning so I can my money's worth, though!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went there , and I have to say it was a great steak!  if your a meat lover, it's a must go!"}
{"text":"Beware of the salad bar! Don't overload on the salad bar because you won't be able to try all of the meats then. They have a huge selection of meats. Everything was very delicious and all of the meats were so juicy and tender. Great place! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best lamb chops ever!! All the gauchos are very pleasant and offers all the meat you want!! Definitely a place where meat lovers go.. Thanks for our full tummy!!"}
{"text":"Been to a few different Brazilian places, don't really care to compare one to the other, would rather speak on what I enjoy. Went with a party of 8 6 adults and 2 kids.  First let me say the service here is OUTSTANDING, I have not received service like this in a long time if ever. Our server Thompson, was Johnny on the spot with everything, while not being intrusive. One of the adults was just about to eat some food with his hands due to a dropped silverware by his son. When Thompson hands him some more without ever being asked, again awesome service.  Food was all absolutely delicious, the filet mignon was about the only thing I didn't care for. My favorites were the flank steak followed by the house special with the garlic steak right behind it. As far as the salad bar, if you need a bigger one go find a sizzlers or souplantation. This place is for carnivores!  In my opinion the best Brazillian Steakhouse I have ever been to. I now have a added spot when visiting Vegas. Well done to all the staff there."}
{"text":"I have been to Churrascarías in at least 10 cities in Brazil.    Fogo de Chão is a solid brand and great representation of the authentic experience.   Summerlin does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being treated to dinner here last Saturday.  This place is AWESOME!! The food was fantastic! The salad bar had a variety of healthy items to eat but you don't want to eat too much especially if you are a meat eater!  After salad, here comes servers with all different types of meat. Beef, Pork, Lamb, Chicken and Sausages! HEAVEN!!!! The meat melts in your mouth and the flavor is to die for!! I highly recommend this place, it's a bit pricey but soooo very good!"}
{"text":"What a fun place for a group. The staff was so wonderful It was a family birthday celebration, complete with children of all ages and everyone and a great time and the food was plentiful and good. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"Word to the wise - don't fill up on bread and salad! Sure, the Market (salad bar) is stupendous, but don't fill up too much on marinated asparagus, nova salmon, brussel sprout salad, salumi,   incredible cheeses.... but I digress. Save it for the MEAT. Yes, it is quite a feast and sometimes can seem overwhelming, but so worth the flavors. After my 3rd time there, I've got it down. I've ID'd all the meats I like most, so I only ask for those now. (Remember, NO doggy bags!) Oh, don't forget to try their creamy horseradish. I'm sure they make it in house - they'd have to, it's just too good to come from a jar.   The sides are just as good as the meat. Garlic potatoes so creamy they melt in your mouth. The fried polenta w/parmesan is crisp and tasty. Fried bananas (they called them that, but I know they used to serve plantains). And then there's the beans w/rice. There's some name for the beans w/meats, but whatever they call it, it's DELICIOUS.  The service is just wonderful. Everyone is attentive and friendly, and really make you feel like you're eating in \"their home.\"  The only thing I would change is to add a real lounge with comfortable couches, etc. and serve cigars and apres dinner drinks. After a full belly, I would have loved to sit back, sip a cognac and smoke a fine cigar!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here in 2 years and the experience was just as how I remember it. While it was a bit crowded because of Valentines Day; the service and steaks were still amazing.  The never ending steak passing by as soon as you sit down just adds to the experience."}
{"text":"When you think of all you can eat steak you may think of Golden Corral. But Fogo de Chao is not like that, it is amazingly delicious with excellent cuts off meat. The service is fantastic and the people are great. They have one of the best rate wine selections of any restaurant with a sommelier selected wine lists."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite restaurant in town. The food is always fresh and delicious. The service is perfect and the staff members are very nice and professional. They are always on top of it all. We have been here more than 20 times and still have not experienced anything bad. The restaurant manager Joao is always making sure that everything goes smooth. He Is very attentive to the guest."}
{"text":"Have always loved this place, but the last visit could have been a lot better. The meat was over cooked and the service below par. The tres leches was to die for though!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Brazilian Steakhouses in and out of the USA and this was definitely the best. The food and service are both amazing."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several Brazilian Steakhouses in Las Vegas.  This is definitely a great one.  If you go to a Brazilian Steakhouse expect to pay at least $50/person.  Fugó de Chao is no exception.  We ate here with a large party (over 20).  The servers were great and did not skip a beat.  Parking is kind of scarce because most of the parking lot is set aside for valet but they do offer complimentary valet.   The restaurant is very big and they easily accommodated our large party.   Now the food.  The meat was great.  I tried most of the steaks, sirloin, ribeye, etc.  The only one I didn't really like was the garlic sirloin; it was kind of rubbery but the good thing about a Brazilian steakhouse is they keep bringing you different kinds of meats (all you can eat).  So if there is a meat you don't like, they will bring you other ones you can choose in short order.  The sausage was great also, wish they had more of a selection of sausages though. I didn't try the chicken or lamb.  Great food and experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful dishes. fresh cocktails. My table ordered strawberry mojitos. they were fresh-made and phenomenal. should be on the menu. Min was a wonderful and attentive server. The meat selection was outstanding. highly recommend fogo de chao to anyone."}
{"text":"I lived in Brazil and love coming back to eat some quality food.  It is super expensive, but the quality and service is very good."}
{"text":"Honestly the food was amazing and the salad bar was delicious BUT THE SERVICE!!! THE SERVICE WAS BEYOND ANY EXPECTAIONS I COULD EVER HAVE. We went for my moms birthday and they really helped customize the experience. She said they made her feel like a queen! I am seriously so mad that I didn't get the waiters names because I could go on and on about how sweet and helpful they were. Love this place and who cares about the price, I'm defenitly going back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!.. We went here for a friend's dad's birthday and the food was awesome!! Besides the food though, there sat us at a table that was by the door, which was okay, there just seemed to be a lot of traffic. There was a very large party next to us that had 2-3 young children that were running around and screaming. It was not a pleasant dinner and it was very loud. It definitely was difficult to talk across the table. Towards the end of dinner, we wanted to get desert due to celebrating a birthday and the wait staff seemed to disappear on us. By the time they came around and asked if we would like desert, everyone was ready to leave. We definitely will try this place again because the food was excellent, but hopefully next time the atmosphere will be better."}
{"text":"Very bad services. Told waiter my son birthday. Brought a desert out put in front of him and walk away."}
{"text":"Regular at Texas de Brazil whenever in vegas and love it.  Always looking to try new places so when I saw these reviews I made a reservatuon.  Don't get me wrong this place is great, in fact a person in our party was in awe and thought this was the greatest place ever.  Me on the other hand was comparing to the other place and IMHO this place fell a little short. The salad bar was fine but the meat service was a little slow.  I had to call over a few of them over to get some meat.  They were actually going to walk right past us if i didnt. We were right in the middle of the action so it wasn't like we were in a far corner and we all had our green side up.  most of the cuts were fine but all the filets, reg and bacon wrapped, we're like beef jerky.  Yes i did ask for med rare. Sad cause that's my favorite.  Also the sausage was more like breakfast sausage. I love the brazillian sausage from tdb. On the upside drinks came fast and the creme brulee was delish. Overall it was ok but I like the other place better."}
{"text":"Insieme ad alcuni amici di Scottsdale, ho avuto modo di mangiare in questo ristorante. La particolarità di questa catena è il semaforo: ogni coperto ha a disposizione un disco verde su un lato e rosso dall'altro. Mettetelo sul verde ed i camerieri che girano per il ristorante si fermano da voi con uno spiedo pieno di carne. Ogni cameriere ha un diverso tipo di carne e di taglio (pollo, manzo, maiale). Ricordate di mettere sul rosso mentre mangiate, altrimenti i camerieri continueranno a portarvi altra carne!!! Se avete modo di fermarvi al bar interno, prendete una caipirinha. Qui la fanno davvero buonissima!"}
{"text":"Very good, attentive yet non-intrusive service, great food (fresh, juicy meats in a wide selection) and salad bar. Not to mention a resonable price. We've paid $1053 for a party of 15, 2 bottles of red wines, bar drinks (plus free flow lemonade at $5 per person). This amount has already included a 18% service fee. Very good value for money. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience, it was my first time there wasn't sure what to expect. The food was amazing the people where extremely friendly. Ricardo made our experience that much more pleasant, taking time to answer any questions we had about the types of food the served and how it was prepared. Caipirinha is a must, a delicious beverage which I learned is actually Brazil's national drink by law. Overall a great experience and a great place to dine. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. This is the first Fogo I've been to, but I've spent some time in Brazil and have had \"real\" BBQ. As with most Brazilian BBQ places, the strategy is to stay away from the salad bar and just load up on meat. Having said that, their salad bar is very fresh and is loaded with some pretty interesting items. The asparagus was cooked perfectly (something I need with beef for some reason).   One of the drawbacks from places like this is overcooked meat. I prefer Medium rare to rare for high quality beef and the servers are more than willing to find you steaks that are cooked to your liking. You're not going to get anything too exotic to choose from like you would in Brazil...i.e...chicken hearts, but it's a nice place in a convenient location. Of course this is in Scottsdale, so you know it's more upscale than it probably needs to be, and that's fine with me."}
{"text":"This place was simply deeeeeeelicious.  They have a wonderful salad bar with lots of cold meats and greens.  After I got my salad I sat down and used the nice card system thingy to get the meat fest on.  They will ATTACK you with food, so once my plate was full I flipped my card over and began to eat. They have the tastiest meats ever, my favorites were the Parmesan crusted pork chop and the bacon wrapped filet mignon.  All of them were wonderfully seasoned and tender.  I left feeling I really got my money's worth of yumminess."}
{"text":"Just celebreatd my birthday early there on Friday and this most recent experience has turned Fogo into my new favorite special occasion restaurant in Vegas (sorry Lawry's but I still love you too!).  Thank you hubby for the most amazing surprise - he told me we were going to the steakhouse at Silver Seven and I believed him!  Super friendly attentive service throughout.  Started out with pineapple-lime Caphrinas - so delicious that my friend and I each had three!  Was surprised that it added $90.00 to the bill but they were deelish!  The salad bar is so fresh with tons to choose from - but being a fan of Texas de Brazil and Via Brasil - I knew to not be tempted too much -a small caesar salad with crunchy bacon on top is all I grabbed.  Our friendly server brought out their amazing cheese biscuits -interesting tidbit - they are actually GF- they are made with yucca flour so no gluten!  We kept gobbling them up.  Soon we moved our cards to green and I was blown away by all the amazing meat! I won't go into the same detail as discussed below but the pichana and garlic filet were my"}
{"text":"First time here and the experience  was awesome. The waitress was super nice and attentive can't  remember  her name but she had blonde hair  and is pregnant. There  was  a gentleman who opened the door  for us when we arrived. As we  ate our dinner another  gentleman  approached us to ensure everything was going well or if we had any questions or concerns. Later into our dinner another  lady approached us as well. Bottom line I will definitely return as well as recommend the restaurant to family and friends!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouses in Scottsdale.  World class salad bar, plethora of wine options.  Meats perfectly cooked to my preference.  Attentive staff, multiple points of contact throughout my dining experience.  Chocolate Molten Cake with ice cream, was the cherry on top."}
{"text":"My wife and I have frequented this restaurant a number of times and had grown to love this place. But yesterday's experience will be our last.  I had made an on-line reservation, and in the request comments of their website I specified that I was bringing my wife for dinner to celebrate her birthday on 12/12/12 (date of our reservation).  We walked in about 10 minutes early, I specified who the reservation was for and we walked right in. At the time (6PM), the restaurant was still empty (it was more than half full by the time we left, about 60 minutes later).    The food is always top notch at Fogo de Chao. The salad bar (especially the smoked salmon, various cheeses and sun dried tomatos are some of our favorites) is well stocked with specialty items.  The meats are always excellent and the diversity offered is the main attractive element of this place.  So where did things start to go wrong for us?  I should mention that we accompanied dinner with a couple of glasses of sparkling wine.  Things started going downhill when our glasses were empty. Both my wife and I were not in a drinking mood, and so, at the first instance of being asked whether we desired more wine, we respectfully declined.  Less than 30 seconds later we were asked again, by a different waiter - this time we thought it was kind of funny to have so much attention paid to us (and we figured that since I had mentioned it was my wife's birthday, they wanted to pay a little extra care to our table), but we declined again.  Not more than 30 seconds later, a different waiter comes by again and asks us the exact same question.  Now it was downright annoying.  Not more than 1 minute later, we received the precise exact question.  My answer this time was more curt, \"We do not want any more wine.\" Fortunately, they did not come back a 5th time.  I have noticed that there is little comminucation among the service staff at Fogo de Chao.  The right hand rarely knows what the left hand is doing.  At this point we had concluded our dinner and the waiter had removed our plates. I was expcting a little slice of birthday cake with a candle to drop by any second. Instead, the waiter comes by with our check.  I was upset at this turn of events.  We're not at In-N-Out here paying $10 for a couple of burgers, and was taken aback that apparently nobody had read my reservation comments - what is the point of including such comments?  I went to the front desk and told the hostess that I was disappointed that Fogo de Chao could not even acknowledge my request. I was asked what my name was and I specified the name of my reservation.  I was told, \"I'm sorry but I just forgot\", was the reply.  Really? So I'm spending well over $100 (including drinks) and the reply that I receive is \"I'm sorry but I forgot?\".  The hostess then asked what table we were at, and mentioned that they would be bringing something by very soon. We waited for 10 minutes and decided to just pay our bill as bothof us wanted to get out of there. Finally, a different waiter came by with a slice of cake, apologizing for the hostess (again with the \"she forgot\" commentary) with a candle for my wife.  It is the little things that make such a dinner memorable. Fogo de Chao completely dropped the ball, in my opinion.  They did remove our drinks from the bill, but instead left a sour taste in our mouths.  Asking us 4 times, within a 2 minute interval, if we want more wine is more important to them than paying attention to the small but crucially significant details that make a birthday dinner special."}
{"text":"Very good service, but their food is hit and miss.  Some is great, such as the rib eye and the lamb chops, but the sausage and their signature beef were lackluster.  The buffet was good but not great.  I've eaten at many better Brazilian steakhouses or churrascarias, including Fogo in Houston and Sao Paulo."}
{"text":"I love churrasco, but Fogo do Chao was bad.  Maybe it is because I just came back from Rio Grande do Sul, the capital of delicious churrasco.  I am so surprised, the meats weren't salted and the flavor was so bland.  Out of the 15 meats I tasted, I only liked the rib eye which was very fatty.  That is strange to me, considering it is a churrascaria.  The bananas.... Oh... it was like eating slimmy slimmy ewww.  I made them before and they were bad, but this was really bad.  The cheese bread was the best thing I ate and it wasn't even the real thing!  How can you mess up cheese bread!?  The salad bar was decent, however the potato salad didn't have flavor.  I have to say, I am disappointed at the taste of the food from this place and won't be returning.  I love churrasco, born and raised in Brasil, this food just won't cut it, it's an embarrassment.   Also, the caipirinha was bad.  The way this bartender made it is not the way it's supposed to be.  Caipirinha are meant to be sweet and lemony, this was bitter (???!!!).  However, on the positive note, the service was great.  But I still left hungry :("}
{"text":"This place let's me live out my Bill Gates fantasy.  This is where I would go into a high end steak house and order everything on the menu and eat till I burst.  That is how good the quality of the meat is.  Service is excellent too.  My only complaint is that they don't have one in Hawaii..."}
{"text":"Being a 20yr Executive Chef,  let's start off by saying every dish is meticulously prepared using the finest ingredients. I was especially impressed with the cold bar.   I've tried many of the Brazil grills here and by far,  this Restaurant surprisingly out shines them all by a mile.   My tip would be, pace yourself at the cold bar no matter how great it is. I always tend to fill up before I flip my card to start my meats rolling in. They will come quickly so to keep the meats hot, flip the card over to stop and eat."}
{"text":"I loved the service of this place.. Very impressive and caring when it comes to celebrating special events... My fav was the lamb... Magnificent! I will definitely come again..."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever bar-none. The meat is amazing, every bite is like the first bite. The service is phenomenal. One waiter accidently dripped juices from the skewered meat onto our table and in less than a minute there was a fresh cloth on the table, and everything was reset. The cheese bread is addicting. We call it crack cheese bread. It is a bit pricey but this place is proof that you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good.  Great salad bar while waiting for all the main courses to come around.  Favorite place in Vegas"}
{"text":"Great restaurant great all you can eat meat! I would definitely come back! And our servers Marco and Norma were the best!"}
{"text":"At Fogo de Chao you will get excellent meat, excellent salad options, and even some tasty side dishes if you so desire.  The wait service is prompt and excellent.  It is not every day that one needs to fill up on several pounds of succulent meat, but when you do, Fogo de Chao is the place to go."}
{"text":"Sunday dinner with family and friends was amazing.  We enjoyed the entire dining experience. The salad bar was great, the meat caravan was delicious and the tres leche cake was yum yum good. It\"s a must when you\"re in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"I went here on the basis of yelp recommendations.  Well, now I question the validity of yelp reviews!! seriously, $59.50 per person for your entre - do you know what that buys you at other fine dining establishments? my goodness and then to be herded in and out.... sorry but not for me. At 39.50, sure there is some value here.  1. They purposely do not bring the filet out to the end - why bring expensive meat when they can fill you up on sirloin or beans/rice? why do you think they serve you beans and rice? 2. The salad bar is awesome - but again the sole purpose is to fill you up so you skip the meat  this is nothing more than a eyeball experience, (yes, you have never seen this before) and  you cannot believe the number of possible meats (and by the way, if you know beef, you will clearly recognize the cuts and the order they bring them to your table).  Go order a nice M/R filet somewhere with a  glass of wine and enjoy. Easy to skip FDC unless you are in it for the eyeball experience. you will easy spend $100 per person for average food, compared  for an excellent meal somewhere else"}
{"text":"I've been to Fogo De Chao a few times and each time it's been great!  This time we had reservations at 7:30 and while we were not seated until 7:50, our short wait allowed us time to learned about a great Brazilian rum.    After we were seated we indulged in an almost gluttonous dance of fresh salads and a perfectly cooked selection of meats.  Then to top the evening off Lou came by our table  to see how our evening was and we laughed and chatted with him for a few minutes.  All in all a great night at Fogo De Chao!   Thanks Lou and team!!!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you like Brazilian steak this restaurant is place you want to be great steak  But you need to be hungry before you go there.  Beef is so good"}
{"text":"The food here is great! The service is excellent. Always checking on us and bringing us what we need! The food has excellent and sooo delicious! It's pricey but definitely worth it. This place is a great experience that you will remember it because of the excellent service great food and amazing place. I hope you enjoy this place for a great treat to some good food."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place was crowded. I'm now convinced that this is a place that people go just to say they went. Went with expectations for large quantities of high quality meat. Meat was overcooked, fatty and low quality. Medium should be pink throughout not well done and grey. My plate was covered with meat scraps and I probably got around two bites of meat that I actually ate. I didn't think this would ever happen in my lifetime but I spit out filet mignon- how does a steakhouse screw up one of the best cuts of beef? Sides and salad bar weren't appealing either. They brought the wrong bottle of wine. The only good thing about the place was they didn't charge me $50 for the dog food they served."}
{"text":"Marco is the best of the best! Good with faces, remembers everyone and he welcoming. Makes the restaurant what it is. He is the face of the Fogo De Choa Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Celebrated my husbands 40th bday here. $51 for all you can eat meat. Open salad bar and they give you fried bananas, garlic mashed potatoes and fresh cheese bread. Drinks and desserts are separate. Prime rib, Rib eye and Top Sirloin were my fave. We made a reservation and gave us a comp birthday cake."}
{"text":"Best place for meat lovers. The steaks are so good. They also have several options for salads. I love their apple salad. It is a great combination to eat with steaks.   They also have various options of wines and other drinks.  And also It is a great place to go on a date (you can and should dress up to impress here) or It is also good just to eat casually with family and friends."}
{"text":"Outstanding quality of ingredients, great team effort of staff, and high end atmosphere. You get the quality you pay for and what more could you ask for really?  Good for impressing a date, better if your super hungry with your meat lovin power eater buds. Dress nice and enjoy."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The service was very good. It is a litte pricey but well worth the money.The servers were very informative and on point. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Desert was very good as well!"}
{"text":"Definitely make sure you are hungry when you visit this restaurant. The service was decent. The vegetable bar was good. The meat selections were not as vast as I expected. There were no seafood or fish passes for meat. (Red meat galore though!) the drinks were a little disappointing as well as the dessert. Not my favorite by any means."}
{"text":"I've been to several Brazilian places before. The food was excellent. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because they didn't have any \"exotic\" meats. Also the salad & side selections  had fewer selections compared to other Brazilian places I've been to around the country. Other  Brazilian places I have been too have had everything from Ostrich to Antelope as part of the meat selections. This place had beef,pork,chicken and lamb in various cuts. The deserts were excellent too, but not included in the cost for the meal. Deserts were just under $10 each. Everything served here was excellent. Plan on spending about $60 per person if you want desert. The staff was polite and efficient. The atmosphere was good too. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Went to this particular Fogo this past week.  We had been to the one in Denver a couple of years ago and enjoyed the experience.  This place... not so much.  I gave it two stars because the meats were very, very good.  However, everything  else you would want in a restaurant was terrible.  Start with value... I don't mind paying good money for a great meal if everything about the place works, but the food vs the cost does not line up.  Also, and my real beef with this place, was the ambiance.  Again, if you pay good money you should want a nice atmosphere.  This place is just a little north of a cafeteria!  Tables are cramped, very loud and just not a good atmosphere to have an intimate dinner with friends would you could actually have a discussion at the table.  You read about it, look at the menu and pictures and you form an expectation of what you will get. For me this place did not live up to expectations."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this restaurant on a suggestion by people who live in Vegas.  We have a couple of Brazilian restaurants like this in Seattle so we knew what to expect but at the same time, we were excited to see what different meats there would be at this location.  The food was amazing, the service was plentiful and Ricardo Pinto was great!  They were well staffed so anytime we had a question, it was easy to find someone to answer it.  The meats were never-ending, constantly juicy and well cooked, and even their \"salad/cheese bar\" had so much to offer!  More than anything, I fell in love with their house-made cheese bread.  Warm, bite-sized, yummy.  I would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Always is very enjoyable to have diner at Fogo De Chao. Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Gustavo took care of my family much better than any luxurious cruise with his first class attention to every detail. Great place."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try a Brazilian steakhouse for a while and I'm glad Fogo de Chau was my first. First off the service was unbeatable, someone was always coming around with different meats and to check on us to see if we needed anything, the manager checked in with us several times and talked to us about the promotions they have for locals and military. Now onto the food, there was so much meat coming to our table it was crazy!  Most importantly, everything tasted great! The salad bar selection wasn't huge but I think it's perfect because in my opinion if you're paying that much to go to a Brazilian steakhouse you're not going there for the salad anyway."}
{"text":"WOW is it good here. Love the decor, the location and the food. Excellent service at all times. You really get what you pay for.    100% recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, wonderful and consistent food every time we come here. Definitely the best Brazilian style steakhouse in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"What a great place. Been here twice and thought both times were great. I have to say better this time than last though.   Was sat right away. Starts with this awesome salad bar that has this enormous wheel or parmesan cheese. You flip your red card to green and holy moly! People seem to come from left and right serving you dinfferent kinds of meat, different cuts of meat and different prepared meats. They keep doing this round and round until you turn your card back to red. You can flip it back and forth all night. They also bring out side which consist of garlic mashed potatoes, fried bananas, fried polenta with parmesan cheese and cheese popovers all night long. Also at your request they have 3 dipping sauces for the meats. 1 a chimchurry, 2 and house made hot sauce and 3rd a horseradish sauce. All very good. For dessert we order both the chocolate mousse and the tree leches cakes to take home. Both were.very good.    The service was probably the best I have ever had. The entire wait team work together. 1 picks up your plate and within seconds you.have a new one. Same with refills and seconds. This is a place that you never wait on them, they truly wait on you. They are on the pricey side, around 50 smackers for 1 person, so I wouldn't come here every day. But man between the food and the service, it is well worth it"}
{"text":"Went here earlier this week for dinner. This was my 4th visit to this location.  As always, service was perfect. I would go here for the salad bar alone. Great variety from basic greens and Caesar salad to my favorite, apple salad.  The meats are all delicious. As compared to a traditional steakhouse where you can only have the single steak you ordered, here you get to sample everything from flank to filet to lamb chop to chicken.  You walk out feeling stuffed, but that's why you go to a place like this.  Went here for my bachelor party last year and they gave us some free flan for the occasion. I didn't think any of us had any room for dessert, but with flan like they make here, you always make room."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was extremely attentive, almost borderline pushy, but the staff was all very friendly so it was nice."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Arizona. I try to get to this place at least one every few months. Everything with this place comes down to quality. There are many Brazilian restaurants, however, most will leave you feeling sick as the quality of their meat is garbage. Fogo de Chao, is not one of those places. I have been to some high end steak houses, and the filet at Fogo is very comparable to those, but you can have as much as you want and they have a great salad bar as well. Every cut of meat here is top notch and you can taste the difference. I have gone to some other high end Brazilian restaurants and none have ever come close to Fogo. The only thing I would stay away from is their garlic beef unless you realllllly love garlic because that's really all you can taste. All the other meats are fantastic."}
{"text":"The food and service are fantastic! I've never eaten so much meat in one sitting, I couldn't help myself! Every item I tasted was cooked to perfection;  the  perfect date!"}
{"text":"The food at this location was amazing! The drinks were good, and the extras on the Market Table were all really high quality and delicious. The service was good, as well. My only complaint is that the website listed the price per person as $32, so it was an unpleasant surprise when the bill came and it was $50 per person."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. But most impressed with the customer service manager Lou. Lou went above and beyond.  Very nice to have somebody care that much about his job and customers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse. The food is outstanding and the service is wonderful. I look for any excuse to go there. Norma is amazing we met her our first time there and every time since, she always has a smile and so helpful. What a great staff! What a great place!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in Scottsdale especially for the one cut price of $42.50. After the hostess seats you the waiter/waitress will come by and explain how the system works. First, you can go to the huge salad bar and pick from the many vegetables and they even had my favorite peppers, Peppadews. After you are finished eating your salad, you can flip the card they give you to green which means that you want meat. Someone might ask if would like a fresh plate and then a gaucho (the person that has the meat on a skewer) will come by your table and tell what kind of meat is on the skewer and ask you if you would like some. I recommend the fillet mignon wrapped in bacon or the top sirloin. Excellent customer service and the best I have in a Scottsdale restaurant in a long time. Throughout the meal fried banana, fried polenta, and mashed potatoes are replenished. You must be careful when picking wines or liquor because the price can add up and its where they make the big bucks. After you are finished with your meal a liquor cart comes around and the person will ask you if you would like something. They have port to expensive wines to cognac. For dessert I would recommend the papaya creme if your not an avid chocolate fan. It is not too sweet and taste a little like frozen yogurt. However, if you are a choclatier, then I would go for the chocolate molten cake. If you want to go it is best to make a reservation because it's a very popular place."}
{"text":"I went here for valentine's day and the food was amazing as well as the drinks. It's a very romantic atmosphere. The service was excellent and our server took really good care of us! I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family because you will not be disappointed. It's a little pricey but it's very well worth it, this is the place to go so prepare to be amazed!"}
{"text":"To go there for lunch was the best choice.  If you go to Fogo de Chão at busy days it is difficult to get the best cuts, but ....  for instance during lunch - they come up only with the good stuff - I would assume they know that they would not get rid of the sausages :-)   Super attentively waiter(s) - some were very good and others even better.  After having the super disappointment at Ruth's before I was close to give up the dream to have descent meet at Las Vegas - but thanks to Fogo I have had my perfect finish at Las Vegas.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"They have an excellent selection of meat. However, if you are a fan of wine and plan on bringing your own bottle, do not bother going. They have a $45 corkage fee and special occasions (Anniversary) are not treated as such by the staff."}
{"text":"Only mediocre compared to Texas de Brazil. It fell very short on the atmosphere and the salad bar. Slightly short on the meats. Couldn't believe we were seated with no reservation so easily....now I know. Service was overzealous!! (I guess that's better than inattentive)."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal and wonderful service! Lou was the best and treated us like royalty! New salad bar outstanding!"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum is all I can say! Best Brazilian steakhouse I've ever been to, and I've been to a few. The decor itself is accommodating to the ambiance in the restaurant. The bar is elegant and have the best drinks there, even though I only drink beer, it's the best to have with the meats they serve. They have over 10 choices of meat. From filet mignon to lamb to rabbit and they are all cooked perfectly. Along with the selection of meats they have their buffet of sides, salads and desserts. The price is very inexpensive $35-50 for the quality of their food, so you will be completely satisfied with the whole meal and if you're in great company, it makes the whole experience that much better! Definitely a 5+ star recommendation!"}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would!!! Fogo De Chao is absolutely delicious in every way!!! From the salad bar that has an amazing selection, each item was scrumptious and impeccably presented, to each meat entree cooked to perfection. Each tantalizing tidbit in between was remarkable!!! To top this fantastic dinner off was the superb service!!! Serious attention to detail. Christopher was sensational!!! He made sure we always had every little thing our hearts desired, and he has a fun, charming demeanor. Thank you for a perfect evening. We will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Food was Delicious, the meat was Amazing! The service Tomas \"tommy\" was amazing.  Excellent customer Service. Very pleasant servers.  Will definitely GO back."}
{"text":"They don't hold reservations even when you make one.  I made a reservation here and was told we have have a few parties ahead of you and ended waiting an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"I've been to 5 or 6 different Fogo's across the country and this was by far the worst one I've been to. Meat was very dry and we had to wait a long time for any meat to arrive. Overall poor experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. Everyone truly works as a team and there is always more and more meat coming around. There were very few things I didn't care for and that was a matter of personal taste. I'm so full I feel like death but it's so worth it! Gluttony at its finest."}
{"text":"If you have not yet been to this place and have any sort of respect for being a carnivore, get yourself to FOGO ASAP. I don't think it's possible for anyone to leave this place disappointed. Even a vegetarian would enjoy the wonderful all you can eat salad bar, however if you are trying Fogo for the first time, do not make the rookie mistake and go crazy when they turn you loose on the salad bar. Save every inch of stomach space for the Unlimited amount of 15 different kind of meats that you will be consuming.  So go lithe on that salad bar if you must, turn that card over to green and let the glorious amount of meats be carved right onto your plate. The three side dishes they bring you are delish don't get me wrong, partake in those, but don't go crazy, it's ALL about the meat.   The only think this place could do better was create a separate bathroom to purge so your stomach could hold more meat.   Fogo is pricey, 47 dollars  a head for unlimited food, so if you aren't hungry don't waste your money. They will tell you about their house specialty mojito. It is quite delicious but do beware its 12 dollars and that's not advertised.  Do yourself a favor, if it's a special occasion or your just looking to treat yourself to a great meal, GO HERE. PLEASE. You've earned it. Afterwards  the amount of meat and food you consume, you may feel that you disrespected all the starving people in the world. YES you did. But damnit its worth it."}
{"text":"I was part of a 36 person wedding party that was accommodated in a party room. This place was just perfect for this occasion, great host and friendly wait staff. Gauchos on the other hand were a bit grumpy, maybe because they cut meat all night? That's my only negative. Salad bar is amazing with all types of Brazilian salad, try the basil pesto salad dressing, it's to die for. Meat galore, do not hesitate to tell a gaucho to send a specific cut of meat."}
{"text":"We went to Fogo De Chao after hearing so many good things about it. I will tell you our good and bad. The good... 1.) Excellent Service 2.) My 5 year old was free and 10 year old was half off 3.) Ok food  the Bad.. 1.) Our server who we became friendly with must have gotten off somewhere around midpoint of our dinner and vanished forever. i understand they work as a team but it was strange.  2.) The salad bar was ok but other than the mozerella balls and chicken salad nothing to sing about.  3.) The meat all tasted the same. The gouchos are a little boderline rude even to a 5 year old who is clearly confused why there is 8 men stickings swords of meat in his face. Calm down a little please.  4.) At almost $50 a person before drinks and dessert Ruth Chris is a MUCH BETTER OTION!  5.) Even with the kids being pretty much free it was still $300 for 3 adults. We all had one soda and shared three desserts between the table.  We left there kind of puzzled like well we might go back for lunch maybe but I don't know. 6.) I wanted to buy  a mozerella ball to take home to my nanny. I was willing to pay $15 or $20 for on little ball and they wouldn't sell it to me. Now come on people we just spent $300 on dinner throw me a bone.  Overall Not the experience we were hoping for but not the worst place I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Went there with the family for brunch on a Saturday and it was absolutely amazing. The cheese balls were fresh and warm. I am a pescetarian but the manager Kappa offered me a seafood tower with shrimp and crab that was delicious! Salad bar has lots of options and the rest of the fam really enjoyed the variety of meats!"}
{"text":"We came here last here for thanksgiving and it was great! They served turkey that we enjoyed so we made a reservation this year at 7:30. When we got there, there was no turkey.  I asked about it and he said he thought they ran out but would check for me. Then, that specific person never came back.  For the first 30 min, we were only offered 2 kinds of meat.   They seemed unprepared for the holiday because there weren't enough people walking around and when they did, they completely skipped our table.  We talked to our server a few times about it and finally more meat came out.     I did enjoy the salad bar, but because We were so disappointed in the service, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great servicing and the meat is to die for!! Shot of cachaca with the meat is very good. Best dinner ever"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious, the service was good.  It was nice to go out with my sister, husband and brother in law.  What wasn't nice was having full glasses spilled down my husband's back.  While he was being his usual polite self, unlike most of the Scottsdale clientele usually would be, that doesn't mean that it was actually okay.    Had he NOT had things spilled on him, I would have been able to rate the service as impeccable as the food, though the Nouveau riche clientele were generally rude (yea I'm talking to you guy who tried to just jump in front of us at the hostess stand, AND the girl who couldn't WAIT to get at that asparagus - which was HUGE and delicious).  Unfortunately, while the staff and managers were all apologetic and asked if we were okay, that was all that happened.    We've never had drinks spilled on us at Fogo E Brasa, and the atmosphere is much more friendly. Their fashion of letting the staff know you would like more (or no) meat at any one time is much easier on the staff.  While the food is excellent, and most of the service good, I was disappointed there wasn't more done for a table that was having their first experience and got to deal with enough drink to require a mop and new chair. We also had several times when our cards were green and the staff wandered around us, without stopping by. We didn't get a chance to try everything.  So, I guess we're sticking with Fogo E Brasa. (Which is I guess now Brazilian Bull)  UPDATE: even after posting here and to their Facebook page, it's obvious they don't care.  Rodizio Grill ftw."}
{"text":"The food, the service and the atmosphere are fabulous! You could make a meal of just the salad bar, but, where's the fun in that?! It's truly all about the meat!"}
{"text":"For a local Brazilian Steakhouse, it isnt bad.. Its definitely not Texas de Brasil, but its a nice place to go eat. The decor is great, staff was nice."}
{"text":"Really nice and great buffet, love the salad bar the fresh bread with cheese is to die, really good drinks."}
{"text":"2nd Churrascaria on the list.  In my humble opinion quite overrated. - the price is extremely high - the passadores weren't too friendly - meat was reather dry and chewy  The intereur design is rather beautiful and even though it was full until the last table, it never got really noisy. The highlights of the evening was the chocolate cake and the wine room."}
{"text":"service was great! food made me stuffed. especially enjoyed the desserts. great restaurant and definitely have to come back again"}
{"text":"Wonderful salad bar, mixed feelings on the meats, some wonderful, some dry and a little overdone, but overall a very fine meal. Service is impeccable. Nice wine list if not a little pricey."}
{"text":"Very attentive servers. Meat was excellent and service was fast. Loved the fried plantains. Excellent last night in Vegas meal."}
{"text":"Carnivores Dream or overpriced buffet?  I had eaten at Fogo De Chao about 6 years before this visit and I had fond memories, perhaps because I was celebrating my 24th wedding anniversary. This visit was an ok experience but not what I expected. When you enter the restaurant, you're greeted with warm, rich tones and textures that lend themselves to setting expectations of a fine dining experience. When you're seated, you see servers with beautiful skewers of different types of meat that look good enough to immediately get your mouth watering. That was actually my favorite part of the dining experience; the expectation of what was to come. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there.  When you're handed the menu, you'll notice there are only a few options that basically amount to meat and/or  \"The Fresh Market\" (aka the buffet), the new Sea Bass and the buffet or just the buffet. There were also some dessert options and some drink options. You'll also notice there are no prices listed, so you have to ask (sometimes repeatedly) to get a full understanding of what to expect price-wise based on the combination of options you choose.  When you get your drinks you might be surprised to find what you were using for a coaster, really isn't a coaster. Our server explained how to summon the meat carvers to you by turning up your round paper coaster size circle on the table from red to green. That meant that a few of us first had to take our glasses off of the \"coasters\", lol! I think at the other Fogo De Chao, they used plastic poker chip styled discs to call your meat server.  Since I'm not a big meat eater but was joining a group of family for a meet-up, I decided before I made my choices; I'd check out the buffet. I recall from my prior visit in another city, Orlando, there were great items on the buffet.  I was disappointed to find the selection not even up to the expectation of a good Sunday Brunch buffet at a hotel. Sure, there was salmon; thinly sliced like what one might have with lox and bagels; and there were capers and onions for good measure. However that may have been the most extravagant item on the buffet. Other than that there was your standard fare veggies, salad and potato salad. (When is the last time you went to a nice restaurant and had potato salad?! I personally don't know of any). I will give them credit for having a quinoa salad option. There were also many items without a label that I had to guess at what they actually were.   So, unless you are going for the meat, I wouldn't recommend it because at about $32 for the buffet and a drink, there are better ways to spend your money."}
{"text":"U have to try this place.  The food is really good and the staff or nice and humble.  Came to this place on my anniversary with my partner.  So delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We had lunch there 2day. 1st time at this location. Its well worth the money."}
{"text":"First time visiting Fogo in Vegas, usually visit the one in Orlando. As there are many Fogo's dotted around the U.S. in different states the standard is always the same i've found and that standard is excellent! Everything from the steak to the chicken to the lamb is cooked to perfection. The filet mignon was to die for and even the cheaper cuts of steak are cooked and seasoned perfectly.   The salad bar has an amazing choice and wide selection, something there for everyone. The real gem of this restaurant is their service. The staff are always so attentive but without being intrusive. The staff here really know what good customer service is! They keep your drinks topped up, clear plates away promptly, open doors for you etc. I've eaten in a lot of restaurants of different prices around the world from UK to Paris to Sydney to LA and by far whenever I visit Fogo I always have the best service of any restaurant i've ever been to. This restaurant is a firm favourite of mine and I can't wait for my next trip to the U.S. so I can return. Keep up the good work Fogo!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday dinner and we were so looking forward to it until we stepped foot into the building. It was all downhill from there with very little upswing. Hostess was MIA when we walked in, not usually a big deal but with such an upscale place I guess I was expecting a greeting, oh well. She came back and seated us at the smallest table for 2 I have ever seen. Situated along the wall with a four top at our elbows and a service station at my back, literally. Ok not bad, I can work with this I guess.. Server explained the dining experience without introducing herself and was not seen again. On to the salad bar which was oh so disappointing. Luke warm, flavorless asparagus soup, caeser salad with almost no dressing or croutons on it, sad looking pineapple and papaya slices were just about all the choice we had. The potato salad was probably the best tasting thing in the whole bar. On to the meats! The best part in my opinion. Most of them were pretty rare though, read bloody, not my 1st choice but most had good flavor. Some did not. The chicken was very dry, as was the pork. The best was the leg of lamb, so much flavor and very moist. The 'fried polenta' was not polenta. It was some sort of previously frozen root vegetable not polenta. The bananas were nice and the cheese bread was pretty flavorless, not my favorite. About halfway thru the meal a server knocked a water pitcher off the service station behind us getting my back sprinkled with ice cold water. The customer service lady was very nice and offered us a free dessert. I choose the key lime pie and my husband got the cheesecake. Both were very bland. Frozen then thawed and drizzled with Lyons flavored syrup. Not worth the calories and definatly not worth the $9 most people pay for them. So very glad we had coupons for dinner because it was not worth the $109 bill without tip. Overall very dissapointed with my experience and won't be returning. I'll take Texas de Brazil anyday over this place. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I wasn't so impressed with the food and the ambiance for the price they charge. Our tablecloth was already dirty when we sat down for the 1st time. There was fallen meat around our table. It was kinda gross for a restaurant that plays off \"high end.\" Try it once and if you don't like it, don't have to go back again right? That'll be me."}
{"text":"Simply the best . the place , salad bar and of course the meat are absolutely fantastic , highly recommended"}
{"text":"They stopped by with beef, pork, and lamb meat until you flip the disk from green to red, whew. Meat cooked perfect and served off the skewer, cut off by the waiters onto your plate. The buffet style salad bar had a good selection. Side was mashed potatoe, enough for two.  My wife and I enjoyed our 30th anniversary here, and we recommend this Brazilian style restaurant to be a good place to celebrate any memorable event. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was great! All Service was fantastic except for our server Ben. He treated us like an inconvenience. It was disappointing"}
{"text":"I really love the fact of the unlimited variety of meat you can eat and the salad bar. Great big atmosphere.  I enjoy it every time I go there."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good. First time going and was bombarded with steak, if you don't take it easily...you et full within minutes"}
{"text":"It was pretty good....  The meat is perfectly clocked and seasoned. The staff was very helpful and nice It is not cheap but I found it correctly priced for the quality of the meat they provide.   The restaurant itself looks quite new and clean, the room is pretty big and the tables spaced enough to be quiet enough  I recommend to make a reservation before going , I went on a Wednesday night and it was packed..."}
{"text":"Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!  This place is so wonderful!  The restaurant is beautiful, the hostess greeted us promptly and we were seated right away, we did have a reservation we had made easliy on the website.  The gentleman that sat us took the time to explain the menu and the process, and he explained that if we had the green card up we would be served, and if we had the red, they wouldn't bring us anything-and he said they were quick!  Well he wasn't kidding, the second we had a green card we were being served, it was fabulous.  The side dishes were great, ranging from cheesy bread, friend polenta, garlic mashed, and a banana dish.  The salad bar was to die for, but don't fill up too much there-as hard as it is to resist.  I had a mango fresca cocktail that was delicious, and my boyfriend had the brazilian beer they had on tap, which he said resembled the taste of a guinness beer. Yum!  The wait staff is very attentive and make sure to cater to your every need, refilling your drinks constantly, bringing your new plates as you request them, and refilling your side dishes if you have room for more.  We really enjoyed our dining experience here and we will be back soon! Highly recommended for any special occassion dinner or when you need to go on a carnivore rampage."}
{"text":"the experience started really badly with an impolite receptionist and a very rude gaucho (meat cutter). If you are Brazilian you would know that we do not expect less than a perfect service, politeness, and great bbq. You will not find that here. The Texas de Brazil is a better option since we have tried both. Thanks to Henrique (chef) and Ademir (gaucho) we ended staying but after the bad moments, all the impoliteness and regular meat, my wife and I cannot rate this place above 2 stars."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food. Ordered off their drink specials, which my husband and I both liked. Only downside to this place is that we have been to a Brazilian steakhouse in San Fransisco that offered probably double the meat choices, had a bigger buffet selection and slightly better atmosphere and attention by staff. I would recommend FDC but know there are Brazilian steakhouses as well."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot! Get treated like special loyal guests and enjoy the customer service given at a high level. Definitely makes our standards high for other restaurants, but my husband and I enjoy spending the extra money for the extra nice treatment. Marco and Lou are wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Lou as manager did a great job making sure we understood all options and was very attentive.  That lamb was the best I've ever eaten and the parmesan pork was fabulous. The chicken on first pause seemed dry but I think that had more to do with the comparison of the melt in your mouth beef. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Like meat? Then yes, indeed, you will like Fogo De Chao.   I was a little surprised when we arrived at the Las Vegas Fogo De Chao, as it was almost 8 PM on a Friday night and the parking lot was more than half empty. I had been thinking for a long time, that Las Vegas really needed a Fogo De Chao, but apparently not everyone agrees, as the restaurant itself was only half full. Is this because of the cost of dining here, or perhaps there are so many good dining choices in Las Vegas including several other excellent churrascarias? I don't know, but it was not because the food was not excellent because it was.   Having been to the Chicago and Beverly Hills locations, I knew what to expect, and I was not disappointed, the cuts of meat were as delicious as at their other locations, the caipirinha were perfectly prepared. My favorite cut, the sirloin cap picanha was superb, I think I had 6 or 8 servings of this. The lamb chops were divine, bacon wrapped filet and chicken yummy, various other cuts of sirloin, rib eye, filet all outstanding. Service was good on this visit, but not great, we did at one point have to wait for a second round of drinks.   What else can you say, but an endless delivery of the freshest tastiest meat cuts, prepared exactly as you wish them, cut for you off the skewer by the gaucho servers, it doesn't get any better than this. One tip, you can overdo the salad bar, which is very good, and short yourself some space to fit MORE MEAT, so go easy on the front end.   Recommended, for those with no dinner budget ( base cost per person for the dinner buffet is now $49.50 plus tax, tip and drinks) and a taste for all things cow, pig lamb and chicken!"}
{"text":"I had been here before but I decided to bring my family for a belated birthday celebration. My parents can be very particular but our server Jose went above and beyond to make sure they had an enjoyable time. The food was great, salad bar and sides are yummy as well. I think it is all about the details though, for example Jose brought my parents peppers/chiles because they're from Mexico so they love spicy food! I also was given a piece of cake which was a nice touch. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Lets start off good and work downward shall we.............. I loved the salad bar THE BEST APPLE AND CHICKEN SALAD I ever had.  Mozzarella Boccochinis, the best asparagus  I have had ever. Not crazy about the Prosciutto (no taste, very blah) but the smoked salmon superbly sliced and Fabulous. Let me not forget what ever was on the table in the pop over bread thing. OMG that was a highlight for me. Now I like to see my wait staff work hard as I tip off that idea. These Guys were on their game, quickly as if they were riding a horse. they came to the table with swords of meat and sliced accordingly to my desired cook level. After sampling every meat  (or most of them) I dawned on me that somehow they all tasted alike.   The saturation on herbs and the distinct flavor of lemon smothered each meat.   Now I like lemon of lamb and pork but not everything.  I did PIG out and I was sorry that I could not afford the 14.50 for a glass of wine nor the 8.50 for a cup of coffee.  I love meat and meat loves me, but I just can't be that glutenous.   Sorry I could not be more support of."}
{"text":"Mediocre chain restaurant. With some of the best steak houses in the world in Vegas I was very disappointed by going to an all you can eat steak and salad bar.   The meat was overall tasteless and the sides were nothing special.  The desert was just sweet for the sake of being sweet.   If you want to go just because it's all you can eat then go for it, but there are a lot of other choices that will give you a better bang for your buck in Vegas"}
{"text":"It is an OK meat place. The service is sometimes average and sometimes outright incompetent. Our drink order was lost several times, extra fried bananas never showed up. In addition, this particular Friday night was a magnet for parties with screaming babies strategically placed in such a way to disturb everybody."}
{"text":"I've been to other locations many times and te service was a lot better. This location took a while and while going to dinner by myself, they ignored me a bit. Not impressed but still good food."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in. The staff including roj was the nicest server ever can wait to come back also loved the signature cut of meat is the best it's a must try if you don't come here you are missing out reasonable nice and fun dinner for the whole family. I hope you come try this amazing place with amazing decor and over all I give it a 10 out of 5 star ratings."}
{"text":"This sort of place (churrascarias) actually used to be one of my favorite kinds of restaurants to enjoy. That is until I became a vegetarian about a year and a half ago... Now, as you might imagine, I don't tend to go as often. But when family comes to town to visit, I let them pick the food destinations...  So now you're probably wondering what a vegetarian could possibly eat in the midst of this parade of meat. Well, the nice thing about Fogo de Chao for me is their killer salad bar, sides and desserts... Starting a wide array of veggies at the salad bar from the hearty asparagus spears and artichoke heart cups to the selection of cheeses and crafted salads and adding on to that the fried polenta sprinkled with Parmesan, cheesy mashed potatoes and fried banana sides, I definitely wasn't going to go home hungry at the end of the night.  But the food didn't stop there for us just yet... We ended up choosing the Signature Papaya Cream and Flan desserts for the three of us to share. First, the flan...  It was very good. Rich and unusually denser that the typical flan, it had a very flavorful caramel taste. Although, if you've just stuffed yourself on a bunch of meat (or in my case veggies), it may be a bit much. The real dessert star was the Papaya Cream though. Light,  yet extremely flavorful with the added bonus of the natural digestif qualities of papaya, it was the perfect sweet ending to our meal."}
{"text":"The two stars is for the salad bar. I haven't been to a Brazilian Steakhouse since going to Yolie's back when it first opened. I don't remember it being that great, probably why I haven't been back. Since that was close to 20 years ago, I decided I want to try this place for my birthday (was going to go to Envy Steakhouse). Nice interior. Great salad bar. But I was SO DISAPPOINTED with the overcooked, dry meats! I can honestly say that every thing I tried was dry! Oh the beef wasn't dry - JUST RAW! The only meat that I liked was the garlic beef I believe. The ribeye was sliced so thin and lacked flavor or marbling. The bacon wrapped beef was RAW, the bacon wrapped chicken was DRY as EFF! And the ultimate foul was the  ovecooked, DRYASEFF Lamb t-bones! A travesty! I didn't even eat it! The rib was tasty just wanted some dipping sauce! For the price, I can not recommend. Well, I can't recommend AT ALL!  The waiters were attentive to our needs, although I would have liked a new plate. I just expected not-burnt  or raw meat to be served at a churrascaria! BOO!  Oh the Brazilian lemonade is the SHEE-YAT! The sides were bland."}
{"text":"The hubby and I came here for lunch during the week.  I can not say enough good things about the food here!! The salad bar has great options, the meats are cooked perfectly and are salty, the sides that come to the table are incredible, and the coffee has to be one of the best  we have had in a restaurant.  The staff is friendly and we were seated right away. I'm thinking that if you go during the weekend that may be a wait since it is not too far from the Strip.  Can't wait to come here again!!"}
{"text":"Wow...went there for dinner last night. There were four of us and we all enjoyed our dinner and the exceptional service. I felt that the meat selections were tastier here than at Texas de Brazil (I have been there 3 times). It seems that other reviewers compared them often. Yes, Texas de Brazil has quite the salad bar, but if you want to go to a Brazilian steakhouse for the meats...then come here. All the sides were great, especially the Po De Queijo (warm cheese bread)...we had several helpings. They have more than just the basics at the Market Bar and the flavor of everything was quite awesome! We enjoyed wine, beer, and cocktails. For dessert, we had a wonderful molten chocolate cake and a smooth, velvety flan.  We all raved about the food, but even more impressive was the service. They were all so very helpful and attentive. If we wanted anything (for example, rib eye steak, rare), someone was always available for us to ask and they would send someone over right away. Each one of us had to turn our \"circle\" to red a few times...meat offerings were coming over all the time and we couldn't keep up. They were very busy, but that didn't affect our service in anyway. Needless to say, we left feeling very full."}
{"text":"Food was good but Derek was AWESOME. We'll come back as long as he helps us again!!!!  Derek you rock dude & you're a good singer!!!"}
{"text":"I never Yelp and literally had to!  I'm in the industry and am completely embarrassed for the owner's of this establishment.  A party of 7 and it took 30 min to get a drink ordered... We finally get our drinks and take it upon ourselves to start our dinner service...so sad for this restaurant because we had 3 newbies that did not experience what they should have.  We helped ourselves to the salad bar and sat back down at the table.  A server came over asked us if we ordered wine (wine glasses on table) and says to the server as he is bringing (20 min long bottle of wine) \"sorry I'm bored.\"  Uhh?  As we are enjoying salad, someone brings us artichoke spinach dip- my thought? I never received a menu to order that in the first place.  We wanted rare cuts of meat that never delivered.  We had a pregnant woman that was unable to eat their offered items and was rudely \"forced\" to order because she would be charged regardless, really?!? Awesome hospitality.  Drinks were forgotten and at the end of the day I would not recommend this place for a night out. Super disappointing because it could be so cool.  Service is disorganized and dissatisfying.  Save your pennies."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorites, this is the palce to go if you want to impress someone and has hands down the best service and meats, you must try the beef ribs!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a work function today. What can I say, this place is awesome! A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum!  Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon.  Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm.  Simply awesome stuff! Taking the wife when I can."}
{"text":"This was my first experience dining here and was not disappointed.  2 of us went around 2:30 pm on a Saturday and had no problem getting a table without a reservation.  All the food was delicious - the salad bar, all the meats (that were brought to the table every few minutes), the side dishes and even the bread. The staff couldn't have been nicer and we especially loved our server Justin. Warning to come hungry and with money - complete dinner was pricey, but worth it for a special occasion! Had a great time and would definitely go back..."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I are more meet tonight than I have in the last month and the garlic steak was amazing.  Derek was a great server and refilled my water on demand."}
{"text":"Imagine your a hungry lion, locked in a shopping mall full of people. They are athletic, unarmed, and some of them have been good enough to coat themselves in A1 or barbecue sauce. Welcome to the Fogo de Chao experience.  Meat orgy! It's absolutely magnificent, take over half a dozen different piping hot well prepared varieties of meat including top sirloin, bottom sirloin, Filet Mignon, pork loin, beef ribs, pork ribs, and lamb stuffed onto skewers that could double as props for a film about Roman gladiators. Hand said savory redolent skewers to an assorted band of servers that seem to dance in and out of crowded tables full of people with amazing ease all at the beck and call of a little piece of paper. It's fantastic! They have wonderful sides as well including caramelized bananas, polenta, and garlic mashed potatoes. There is also a salad bar, and I think it was nice but quite honestly wasn't the analogy about the damn lion the point here?  Happy hunting."}
{"text":"We have dined at Fogo's many times and have never been disappointed. One of the manager's, Marco always comes to our table and greets us. He is so friendly, he makes you feel like you are a part of the family. The waiter Rico is always very accommodating and will immediately take care of your requests. The food is always fresh and the meats are prepared the way you like them.  The salad bar is magnificent!  Special occasions are always celebrated with a free dessert!   Service is excellent, and the bathrooms are very clean.  They offer very generous specials throughout the year so do join their club.  We can't wait to return!  Reservations are needed because they are always busy!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! Service is the best I've experienced. Food is the best I've experienced. Be sure to get a small portion from the salad bar; save your appetite for the meat!!!!"}
{"text":"Worth every 44.95 ever. Superior service as well as its Chicago sister. Flank steak amazing. Tips: Pass on getting full on salad bar goodies, potatoes & bread. Wait for the meat & fried bananas!!!  Lamb chops seem to come out towards end of your fullness so ask for lamb chops upfront!! Beef rib lovers they got em! Just ask !! So so worth the money & kids are 24.95"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. We were invited to dinner by our friends who are Brazilian and wanted us to try authentic Brazilian food. We were told to come hungry. All I have to say was I was not disappointed. Soooo many food choices and they were equally delicious. My absolute favorite was the filet. Dessert was equally delicious. It was an amazing experience. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service. Was a great experience with some of the best food. Don't waste your time at the salad bar"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come in it's all about the state care I am a meat guy I love the meat here can't complain about the waitresses either good food good service what else can I say reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Wow - so good.  Very, very good!  My wife and I began our evening with reservations (recommended on weekends) and felt that we truly received VIP treatment from start to finish.  The food, a variety of Brazilian style cooked meats, was served tableside and each bite tasted better than the last.  The wine list was vast and creative.  The service was terrific.  Polite, informative, but not too invasive.  A wonderful evening, an interesting experience, and we can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"First, salad bar. For a place that relies heavily on meat as the star of the show, the salad bar was great. Kale salad was amazing, and the selection of cheese and charcuterie, although small, was really good too.  They also bring you some sides to the table. Mashed potatoes, fried plantains, fried polenta and some sort of cheese pastry. All delicious.  Now the meat. It was disappointing. The meat was good, but undeseasoned. it needed some sort of sauce maybe. I made do with the basil sauce from the salad bar. I overall enjoyed the food, but it was not worth the money. For a steakhouse, the non-meat items would be the only reason I'd ever want to go back."}
{"text":"What there for lunch excellent service and food. Looking forward to going there again."}
{"text":"Best Brazilian steakhouse that I have been to, and I have been to about ten.  All the meats are so good, but I would suggest leaving room for the Rib Eye and Filet Mignon.  They pass those around later in the meal.  You could ask for them too from the waiter.  Go easy on the chicken and pork.  They are good, but the Filet Mignon and Rib Eye are too die for.  Melts in mouth good, barely have to chew it.  The salad bar is so fresh and so many choices.  It's also more fancier than most BBBQ.  This is a nice place to go for special occasions.  The price is $50, not too bad for a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"Even a vegatarian could dine like royalty here .  Excellent quality , service and enviroment ."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! It was my husband and I anniversary, Lou Di Nolfi was amazing, greeted us at table and offered us a complimentary dessert for the occasion. We had a great time and I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've visited this place numerous times. I've had amazing experiences and not so amazing experiences. This last time was the deal breaker for me. My husband who in a few days will celebrate 20 years of Sobriety was served an alcoholic beverage. After profuse apologies some of which were genuine, they actually still charged me for the drink. Come on.. we order a non alcohol beverage and instead received alcohol then you still charge me for it. Never once did the manager come out. This is some cases could have been life changing for most alcoholics.  To not receive the compassion or even acknowledgement is enough for me to go ahead and leave them alone. This same visit, I arrived 30 min prior to opening, waited for them to open to have them help customers that arrived after me and had just walked in the door. I get it, the customers were Brazilian didn't make them any more important than the other customers. They tried to squeeze 7 of us to a 6 person table and didn't appreciate me asking to move to a more roomy table. It was lunch time on a Wednesday, no reason to squeeze anyone like Sardines. Just a bad visit all the way around."}
{"text":"Texas de brazil wins hands down . The meat was dry . The pao de queijo was good . Overall it sucked . Sorry but I recommend everybody go to Texas de brazil"}
{"text":"Dined here with family and loved it. Centrally located with valet or self parking. The service was amazing and the servers were extraordinarily accommodating. I wanted tiny tastes of the meats and they obliged without pushing more food on me than I wanted.  The servers were friendly and in the know re the menu options and immediately cleared plates and brought fresh plates. The sides served on the table were fantastic. I especially enjoyed the chicken and filet.  Loved that the meats were not heavily sauced or salted.  Everything on the salad bar was fantastic - the smoked salmon, hearts of palm, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus , cucumber salad, artichoke hearts and cheeses were standouts for me. Some  reviews I'm seeing favor other Brazilian steakhouse salad bars over Fogo's, but I loved Fogo's due to the variety of healthful options. After all, if I\"m going to go a bit protein crazy for my entree, having some fresh vegetables not dripping in oil or sauce is a good thing!   That being said, the crispy polenta served as a side was outstanding and the rolls on the table were fabulous. (Bread has to be really \"worth it\" to me to spend the calorie real estate -- these were!) I was impressed by the wine selection and the by the bottle, half bottle or by the glass options. We had no stomach real estate room but the in-house-made desserts certainly seemed appealing -- many options.  I love the fact that they have a lunch option as well that is quite affordable. I left my meal feeling content and not feeling sick or stuffed. And the scale didn't show damage the next day, either.  Kudos to Fogo!"}
{"text":"I loved everything here. The salad bar is much better than the typical sort you see in chain restaurants like Ruby Tuesday's. The wine tastes really good and you get a sample before they give you a full glass of something you hate. It's a win win for customers and the business. The meats are all good and cooked to different temperatures, so you can get exactly what you want. The atmosphere is great and the staff is super friendly and attentive. They also have military discounts!!"}
{"text":"There are \"like to go eat there\" types of restaurants and \"have to eat there\" restaurants. This is a \"must have to eat there\" restaurant!  Great food. Fantastic service. I'm heading back to FdC before I leave this crazy town!"}
{"text":"From a comparison point of view, this restaurant is not in the same league as the Fogo in Las Vegas. The quality of the food was true to Fago's high standards but the service was over-the-top-annoying. There was way too much \"is everything ok?\" to the point of interrupting our meal and conversation. I had to tell them that we would let them know if everything wasn't okay and to allow us to enjoy our meal. Seriously, at one point I was asked \"how is everything?\" twice while chewing the same piece of meat!  In my world, along with food quality, dining service is equally important, if not more-so. This Fago must define it good service differently."}
{"text":"If you're a carnivore you need to check this place out. It's all you can eat top quality meats. Yes it's pricey but it's very well worth it. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience with fogo de chao in São Paulo Brazil..so I wanted to try here in the USA, so I was very very disappointed with the food and the side dishes, the meat was not taste like in Brazil. The drinks were ok. Desert not good at all. If you want a real barbecue I suggest to go to Brazil and try it there..I been in many in Brazil and all was really good!!"}
{"text":"I didn't  go for the great salad bar or even the best dinner rolls I have  ever had. We went for the steak....every one of the options(over 10) were fantastic. The fact that you get to try as many and as much as you'd like makes it great.  No this isn't a buffet like it  sounds. GO hungry and leave happy,period."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, service was prompt. Ambiance was also nice, wish we were seated in the middle of the room, but was there during a busy time.Do make reservations--I did and was seated within 2 or 3 minutes. The waiters/waitresses were very nice. The meats were also delicious, not a big fan of their Lamb however, but then again, Im not a big fan of lamb in general. The salad bar was also delicious, but I wouldnt indulge too much with the salads as there are too many other choices of steaks that one should try."}
{"text":"This place has everything you expect to get when you go out to eat~ Great Food, Great Atmosphere, and Exceptional Service. In today's economy I insist that if I am going to spend good money I should be rewarded in return. The meats are so delicious...you can choose to taste them all but I love the picanha and I ask the waiter to just keep bringing this wonderful cut. It literally melts in your mouth. While most people prefer well done you would be doing a disservice to yourself  to eat picanaha well done. All Brazilians eat  picanha  either  rare or medium rare. I prefer medium rare..It's the best meat I've ever tasted.  The staff is so attentive and courteous-they really stand out. I love to tip them generously because they really deserve it. Not like most places I've been to. The salad bar is delicious. I would love it if they'd incorporate sushi like most other brazilian steakhouses in NYC but I won't hold it against them.  Be sure to go hungry. The atmosphere is not too uppity and not too casual just a really pretty elegant experience. I have been here with the girls, with the family. It's great for all occassions.  You won't be disappointed with the food or service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Wass in Las Vegas looking for a Brazilian restaurant , I must say the food was amazingly delicious and the customer service was great not only from our waters Steven and Jose but everyone over all was very attentive, if your looking for great food and good service this is the place To go!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. Delicious food. Very clean resturant & restrooms. Staff worked as a team. Salad bar fresh, absolutely the best selections. A number of delicious meats. Dessert was awesome. Definitely all around 5 stars for this resturant. Definitely would return. Also kid friendly. You can dress casual and not feel awkward. The manager on duty today is A+ in our book, stopping by to make sure everyone service was satisfactory!"}
{"text":"From go  A wonderful place to go. The salads are good but the meat is great every few seconds someone would ask if we wanted this or that. We left so full I was light headed and I didn't even drink any wine or alcohol. Wonderful staff very on top of it. Thanks guys see you nest time"}
{"text":"This place is great, but Be sure to bring your appetite! The salad bar is amazing, stocked with cheeses, sliced meat, fresh fruit, a roasted beat salad, chicken salad and much more. Everything is bursting with flavor and taste fresh! Then to the main course... during dinner you are served some creamy garlic potatos, polenta and yummy carmelized plantains which are out standing. Then there is meats after meats brought around, shaved off a giant knife!  For service...the entire team is was helpful & friendly. Drinks were always full & they asked if we had meat request! Our main server Phil was FABULOUS, his recommendation of the Fogo beverages were great, he was friendly and even had a great sense of humor when we made jokes! Never would have know he just finished training, we loved him. He even asked the manager to take my daughter to see the kitchen, which was really awesome! Oh and if you're celebrating a birthday remember to save room for dessert. And one tip: avoid the bald server, he is aggressive and rude."}
{"text":"Good food. Unfortunately (or fortunately for us), we sniffed out a scam. Check your bills. They overcharged us by +\~ $100. After we alerted the cashier to the mistake, we were offered a shoddy explanation that would leave even the most trusting soul saying \"hmmmmm\". I surmise there is a rotten apple amongst the staff. Overall, good food. Nice people. ...But something smells funny."}
{"text":"Best service i feel like a king best place and my fav place to eat in LOVE.........??"}
{"text":"Drove in from California to celebrate my wife's birthday in Vegas and she decided to try this Brazilian steakhouse. First time for the both of us to try Brazilian BBQ. Let's just say the experience here did not disappoint. The staff was very attentive, pleasant, and professional. We had some wonderful conversations with two managers who also provided some excellent suggestions for us as we sampled the various meets that were brought to the table. My wife and I hardly ever eat lamb, but we decided to try out the lamb T-bone which one manager said was fairly new to the menu. I didn't think I would like it but it's was very flavorful. I realized to late that I should have asked for smaller portions when sampling most of the meats. Once I figured out which meats I enjoyed most, I could request those meats again and again to be brought to our table. Unfortunately I got stuffed before I could follow that plan. Stuffed on sampling the various meats and stuffed on the other stuff like salads, cheese, peppered maple beacon strips, grilled veggies, and so on. If you enjoy eating great cuts of meat, don't fill up on the other stuff. If you never give something a try, how will you ever know if you like it or not... take the chance and you might be surprised..."}
{"text":"My special lady took me here and I was delighted. Excellent service and great food....a carnivores delight. The salad bar was perfect for me with prosciutto, mozzarella, olives, cheese, hearts of palm and peppers....all my favorite foods. Once you give the green \"light\" ...the meat arrives nonstop. If you pass enough times they will actually stop and ask what they can get for you and prepare it to your liking. This was my first visit but definitely will not be my last. If you have a friend or family member that loves meat...splurge and take them here for a great treat."}
{"text":"I attended the Scottsdale location on Saturday, August 30th.  I lost a gold ring at the valet driveway.  If found, please inform management.  Ring was great sentimental value.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Ribeye was the clear winner here, seasoned tender and juicy medium rare. Have a shot of Veev(acai berry alcohol) and let it all digest! Yum"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had raved about this place for awhile so back when Phoenix Restaurant Week rolled around and Fogo de Chao was featured as one of the participating restaurants a group of us gathered together to go experience a Brazilian steakhouse.   It was packed, which was to be expected as usually this place is on the pricey side, and I think there was some problem with our reservation but it was sorted out and we were seated in short order.   Now I was just here for the meat but after some prodding I decided to do a loop around the salad bar so I could say I experienced everything. Man, what a salad bar! They had everything from fruits to and veggies and the regular old salad with lots of dressing options to meats and cheeses and whatever else you could possibly want.   When you're ready for the meat to come to you, you flip over a little round card that is given to every place at the table. Red means no, green means come at me boys! This signals the servers walking around with skewers of different meats to stop by and ask if you'd like a slice. The answer is always yes yes yes! I tried to try one of everything and between the chicken, steak, pork, and lamb I had a menagerie of animals on my plate. Everything was succulent and juicy and the best part was with some of the meats you could tell them how done you wanted it and they would flip to the appropriate section to slice you off a piece.   There is of course a moment when a lady decides that there is simply too much meat to fit into her mouth anymore and with some reluctance I flipped my card around to red to stop my stomach from bursting.   The cherry on top of this sundae was that our restaurant week flat price included a choice of one of three desserts and it was delicious.   I would definitely recommend this place to those of you wanting to try something new and the price point makes it a great special occasion restaurant. (I know where I want to go on my upcoming anniversary!)"}
{"text":"Professional restaurant ! Get seated is so smooth !  Service is so perfect ! Food is delicious ! Very clean !  If I told them something I need , I get it right away !  Of course I will go back !"}
{"text":"If you like steaks and you like salads, then this place is for you!! I just love their salad bar, it's so tasty and satisfying that I find myself wanting to go for seconds and thirds :) But I would rate their salad higher than their steak...They are a bit pricy but I think worth it for a wonderful and different dining experience."}
{"text":"I was a first timer here at Fogos, the food was great but the service was poor and the waiters are rude.. My father in law overheard one of them saying that we probably had minimum wage jobs.. Our family owns a business, we are a modest and humble Hispanic family and have never experienced rudeness at that level. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was a ruined anniversary for us. The positive : servers were all great, salads were diverse, and tasty. Sides were adequate.  The negative: in a place where the star was supposed to be the meat it was mostly inedible. The garlic beef was mostly fat and gristle, chicken dry, bacon wrapped beef tough, never saw any lamb, ribs or filet.  I have NEVER complained about a restaurant while still there but today I could not contain my disappointment as this meal spoiled our special day.  Norma and Marco apologized profusely but it was too late to make up for the poor food served. We were not charged for the dinner and we were given a piece of cheese cake, but the damage was done. We will not return. It would be ridiculous to return and ruin another night out. I don't not get the great reviews!"}
{"text":"Incredible as usual. Meats were seasoned and cooked to perfection, expensive yes, but worth every penny. The wait staff is spot on and attend to your every need."}
{"text":"Great location for a family dinner. Food was absolutely delicious and the service was great. All the waiters were very attentive and felt right at home. Can't wait to come back to town and visit."}
{"text":"I live in San Diego and went to that location a few months ago, then moved here for the summer and realized there's a Fogo de Chao here also.  Went on the 4th of July and it was just as great as I remembered.  The service is great, waiters are very professional, and the food is delicious.  I have tried a few other brazilian bbq places, but Fogo de Chao is definitely my favorite so far.  I'm really glad they opened the San Diego one as well so I can keep going there when I move back."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for a work trip and I brought my wife here for dinner. She loved all the of the cuts brought to the table and loved the service  and atmosphere. I have been eating a vegetarian diet for about six months and the salad bar was more than enough with a ton of fruit and veggie dishes so I didn't feel bad not eating any of the meat. Would love to come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing selection, pretty decent salad bar - what more can a man ask for!"}
{"text":"Wow, muy divertido, la dinámica de las carnes excelente, muy buena carne!!! Y la barra de ensaladas deliciosa, la coktaileria esta muy bueno, para echar el Precopeo"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Food is always amazing! The meat is so juicy and the service is great! Been in several times and always a great experience"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my wife for date night. I'd been here for lunch previously but never dinner so we took the safe route and made a reservation. We arrived and were promptly seated. My wife and i each visited the market table and got a small salad. After that we flipped our cards and the fun began.   My favorite two meats were the Pinchia and the Filet(without bacon). The filet was so fresh and perfectly cooked it literally melted in your mouth. We were served the last two pieces of garlic beef from one of the meat people and it was way overcooked.  Other than that we were able to get the requested temperature on every other meat.   Our waitress was very attentive and refilled our drinks before they ever got close to empty.   The reason it gets a 4 stars is what happened when we paid(take note it was not our original waitress that processed our check). We had a $100 visa gift card and requested that they charge $100 on that card and the rest on another card. When the bill was returned they had charged only $80 on the visa gift card and the remaining amount on the other card with no explanation.   We had a great time and will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Last Saturday night the hubby & I had a date night & I picked Fogo de Chao for dinner. I made reservations for 8, but we were running very late so I called & asked if we could push it back to 9 & they were very accommodating.   When we finally arrived we were immediately seated in the full dining room. Our server gave us the break down of how they operate here & told us we could get started at the salad bar. We each got a plateful of yummy veggies, cured meats & cheeses. Our favs from the salad bar were: parmesan & manchego cheeses, prosciutto, artichokes, salami, asparagus & mushrooms. After that we flipped our cards to the green side & a slew of meats were presented. We tried 2 or 3 at a time, then flipped to the red side to sample & then flipped back to green when we were ready for more (you'll understand what red & green means when you go!). We tried 10 different meats & our top 4 favs were: picanha-top sirloin (their signature steak), cordeiro-lamb legs & chops & beef ancho-rib eye. Included with the endless meat options are 3 side dishes: polenta, garlic mashed potatoes & caramelized bananas, you also receive a basket of pão de queijo-cheese bread. The sides were just ok, the potatoes were the best, but that cheese bread was so yummy!   Total for everything including drinks (no cocktails) but not including tip was $107. Not cheap, but considering the amount of food you could possibly get, it's worth it! Not a place I would go to regularly, but it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a meat lover!"}
{"text":"The lamb chops are a bit gamy.  Otherwise our experience was excellent."}
{"text":"We celebrated my moms 70th BITTHDAY party here and we had  amazing time as well as our 20 guests. They all love the food and the friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Massively overpriced cheapy buffet. This place had good reviews and it's all you can eat steak, what is not to love right? WRONG! Their salad bar is definitely the worst  salad bar I have ever tried. Bland, gross, cheap. The meat was gross too. I tried nearly  all of them and was Super disappointed. Dry, chewy, lacked flavor. For $50 a plate I expected at least slightly better than average food. No joke, I would have had a better meal at a $19.99 vegas buffet. Next time I want to spend $50 on one plate I will head over to Flemmings. Never a bad meal there!"}
{"text":"This was my second time experiencing the amazing food here. Everything was incredible!!! I took all my family so they could also experience it, and they LOVED it!!! The location, the cleanliness, the staff, our waiter \"Minh\", very professional and helpful. Everybody there is so happy. They made it something to remember, plus the event was for my parents Anniversary, so it was special. Thx everyone!!!"}
{"text":"For meatatarians! Wow, bring on the beef. From chicken legs to lamb this place serves you as much meat as you can handle and then some.  Everyone is given a coaster like deal that is red on one side for stop, and green on the other for go! The servers will continue to come to your table as long as the green side is up. I believe I have tried all their cuts of beef, but my fav is the house beef. So tasty and mouthwatering. The salad bar is full of delicious options: salmon, brie, chicken salad....etc. The side dishes are also great: mashed potatoes, this awesome little bread, and plantains.  The desserts are delicious!"}
{"text":"Heard great feedback from friends, but didn't live up to expectations.  Salad bar was ok, out of multiple items both trips from the table.  Meat was average, excellent service."}
{"text":"We went here on Valentine's Day and the food was incredible as well as the service. We got there pretty early but could see the crowds coming in as we were getting ready to leave. Great ambiance, great service, great food, and great drinks!!!!' What more can you ask for?   How about the buy one get one free coupon they were giving away :-) icing on the cake"}
{"text":"came to this location for dinner with my family because my neighbor told me he had a wonderful experience. The venue is beautiful. Looks very elegant inside with a stunning wine cellar. As we came in and sat down the staff was extremely friendly. Very welcoming. This was our first time at a brazilian steakhouse so having our waiter explain the red light and green light for meats was exciting for the kids. The salad bar was to die for! the chicken salad was one of our favorites along with the hearts of palm, proscuitto, and apple salad. The variety of fruits is a treat for desserts and our children. When the meats first around the Gaucho chefs seemed to be very knowledgeable. I was blown away by the variety of unlimited meats! Filet, Ribeye, Lamb Chops, Parmasean crusted pork, pork ribs, beef ribs, ETC. Im sure I'm missing more but those are the ones which stuck out most. My wife eats her meats medium well and i prefer medium rare. The chefs were on top of our table entire experience. My servers Julian and summer were very quick to refill our waters and cheese bread. Speaking of the cheese bread is was DELICIOUS. We kept eating and they kept replacing. We will definitely be recommending this restaurant to our family and my friends on Facebook."}
{"text":"We got one in NY so I know what to expect.  Really good food and lots of it.  Me and my boys didn't leave hungry!  You can't go wrong with this place.  Look for it outside Vegas too."}
{"text":"Ambiente agradável, bonito e limpo. Ótimo atendimento, rodízio de carnes bom, buffet de saladas muito bom. Retornaria com certeza.  Mas o de New York é melhor."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great.  Until I got hellacious food poisoning. I spent the entire next day hurling my guts up from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon.  Not fun."}
{"text":"Definitely a great experience. Even if the service makes me bring it down a star, the food alone is worth 4 stars. The salad bar is amazing and the meat is tender and savory. If you're not sure about it 'cause of the price, it their lunch mon-thurs. it's about $12 cheaper and is worth the experience."}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil is much better, from the bread and other appetizers to the soup and salad bar. We were somewhat disappointed bit it was on overall. They seemed to come around with their house steak constantly and only rarely with chicken."}
{"text":"So went to fogo on Valentine, and let me just say we were not served well.   Had reservations at 6:30 was promptly seated by our host, but then that's where it went south. After our host sat us, we waited for 20 min for a server to ask if we wanted any drinks. We went greeted by a server or anything. In fact I was very confused on who my server was. I understand that it's Valentine's Day, and maybe there was a mix up, but we didn't have a server for our table period.   The food was delicious but I don't understand why they ask how we like our meat, because virtually all the meat that we asked ( med rare) were well done.    When we were ready to pay we literally sat there for 30 min trying to get someone's attention. I finally got the hostess attention that was seating another couple. A guy came over and gave our bill. Then another 20 min sitting there waiting for someone to pick up my card, had to waive another person down. And guess again waited another 20 min for my card to get back.   Needless to say we were not happy whatsoever.  Have never been so disappointed in a reputable restaurant."}
{"text":"We took company from CA here because they are big meat eaters - we are not - but heard about the great salad bar and were not disappointed there - it was wonderful.  Our CA company loved the fun of it and the food and the experience.  We would take company again although it is too much for hubby and me - we are not meat eaters - we did try the chicken wit our salad bar and enjoyed that - tasty - we are normally fish eaters.   I do suggest a try if you want something different.  The service was good - somebody at the table all the time - the side dished okay but not memorable to me.  The salad bar I will remember - thank you. We did think it was odd they did not come by and ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee at the end of the meal - we almost always have a coffee - maybe the four of us would have split a dessert to celebrate a little but we were handed the bill and her hubby paid before I realized what happened - that seemed rushed - with no menu and no one else appearing to have dessert or coffee that may be the way it is.   Thanks for an overall fun experience - our company was happy."}
{"text":"couldn't be more pleased with the service and the food. Hugo was the best server ever. Caleb the GM what a wonderful positive young man. So very very impressed. We will see you again soon for sure."}
{"text":"I almost gave this place one star, but decided to give it two so people didn't think I was just going off on a rant.  My wife and I decided to go celebrate a special occasion at Fogo de Chao to celebrate her passing the CPA exam.  We were both excited to go and try it out based on the reviews we had read.  I'm not really sure if we ended up hitting an off night but disappointing for a $150 dollar meal...  Let me say, first off, it wasn't all bad.  The interior is great, and staff, very professional.  The salad bar was very good, but ended up being the highlight of the evening. The fresh bread that they brought out and drinks were very good, however, when we flipped our cards over and began receiving meat, our disappointment began.  I love medium rare, not rare, and not well done meat. Every time I asked for a streak, I would ask for medium rare, and would ALWAYS get medium well to well.  I don't believe there was ever any pink in any of my steaks.  The chicken was overcooked and at times had to scrape the chard skin flakes off  before eating. Even the lamb came out slightly overdone, but edible.  unfortunately I am not a huge fan of lamb, I came for the steaks and expected more.  We tried every piece of meat on the menu in an attempt to find something worth the 50 dollars a plate we were paying, After about an hour, we discovered that the filet (not the bacon wrapped) while request medium rare, was closer to medium instead of burnt. Finally something besides salad and the sides worth eating.  Would I recommend this place to anyone?  For the price, absolutely not.  I could have gotten a much better meal for the price I paid at Ruth Chris, or any other steak house for that matter,  In addition, if any steakhouse had served me a well done steak instead of my requested medium rare, I would have simply sent it back to the kitchen.  My only option in this case was disappointment as I sampled all the available choices.  Overall, the only way I would ever come back to this place would be for a free.  I really hope I just hit an off night or something based on the reviews or people are diluting themselves. You'd have to be crazy to drop this type of money here with all the great places to eat around Fogo de Chao."}
{"text":"I have been to forgo in Beverly hills, San jose, and las vegas and this location is by far the best.  Excellent service, ambiance and fresh food.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in the US. Make sure you stick with the higher end cuts of meats, filet, lamb chops, and beef ribs.  Don't fill up on breads, chicken hearts, chicken legs, and pork."}
{"text":"We went there 3/11/15 for dinner and the service was lousy. We have been there several times, I have seen big change on service quality. They bring same kind of meat (looks like a left over) and it takes for ever to get one too. I'm giving 360 E. Flamingo thumbs down."}
{"text":"I had Chris at the bar for my server- he is by far the best! Serviced well and very kind! Thank you for a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch and I have to say, we were happier when we left here than when we've left other top brunches on the strip. The salad bar had wonderfully fresh fruits, salads and vegetables. The meats and sides were delicious. Service and beverages were also on point. Manager Chris Kuhn made the rounds to ensure that everyone in the restaurant was happy. As I creep towards my 40's I've realized that I'd rather have high quality food and service like what we got at Fogo vs the dozens upon dozens of options at a traditional buffet that taste, well, just ok.  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went for lunch our first time and we had a great experience. We returned for Thanksgiving dinner and we had yet, another great experience.  Great salad bar, great meats, delicious bread, OUTSTANDING service. The sides we brought to us promptly and as we would run out of anything it was soon replaced without asking.   They are open for lunch everyday and my sweetheart and I visit every 2 weeks. Our favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"I love, love this place! The salad bar is so good and so is all the meat! All you can eat.  The bread, the sides! If you have not eaten here, I highly recommend it. The food is amazing, especially if you love meat! I gave them four stars because the bar drinks are a little too pricey in my opinion, but other than that, the dinner is so worth it!! Great place for a dinner date."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely combing back. Our server Minh was AMAZING and basically took care of all our needs."}
{"text":"It was me and my fiancé first time dining at Fogo de Chao and I must admit we were very impressed. The food was fantastic and everyone was very respectful and friendly. Lighting was perfect, not too bright and not too dark. Recommendation? Staying away from the appetizer table and getting your tummy full off of the amazing, great quality meat."}
{"text":"Disappointing..on previous visit found this restaurant enjoyable but somewhat noisy but could overlook based on the overall experience..this last visit on Saturday evening left much to be desired..the meats were overdone and you couldn't find a medium or medium rare cut..sides were not replenished unless you asked..this experience was certainly not worth the $$$ and will not see me again..too much other fine dining available in the valley"}
{"text":"This was simply an amazing dining experience. My boyfriend and I have eaten in several Brazilian  steakhouses, including one excellent but more casual one in Guadalajara, and this one in Scottsdale shames the others. SHAMES THEM!  The service was spot on, the meats more flavorful than other Brazilian places we've been. Amazing wine list. And am I crazy or were all or most of the wait staff actually Brazilian??! The boyfriend has known several Brazilians and spotted the accent. How much more authentic can you get?  I adore the salad bar at these places, but holy moly i wasn't prepared for the cheese bread. When you read the words \"cheese bread\" you're mind might go immediately to Red Lobster type places. Or at least mine does. Yak. But these are little pillowy soft bread rolls with a cheesy consistency. Not heavy at all. How do they get the flour and cheese to play nice like that??  I have to disagree with people's comments about waiting longer for well-done cuts. I dont eat anything that isn't brown brown done. And they happily offered up the perfect cuts.  how can you no to bacon wrapped sirloin. Dear god!"}
{"text":"Came here for friend's birthday dinner.    Parking:  Easy access, valet or self-park  Ambiance:  Nice for group get together  Wine List:  Extensive and reasonable priced.  Our group tasted 4 bottles. Our favorite of the night is 2011 Temparnillo.  Food:  Meat selection offered at our dinner night seems to be less when compared to my previous visits.  Salad Bar and bread are fresh & excellent.   Service:  Great & Attentive"}
{"text":"I've been to some of the top Steak Houses in Vegas and this place is defiantly in my top 10. Great food, low lighted ambiance, and best of all top notch service! This place can possibly be my new power lunch restaurant.        If you haven't experienced  Brazilian style dinning you should experience here first."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Fogo De Chao. Now here are a few things you should know...   It's expensive. Know in there knowing it's going to cost you $50 a person. BUT also know that you are going to experience some of the best food you've ever had. Go in knowing the cost and that you're paying for incredible food and a very unique experience. It's worth it for me, make sure it's worth it for you too.   It's all you can eat! So come hungry!! There is a very extensive salad bar and then the meats come around when you're ready. I always recommend either not filling up on the salad bar or skipping it all together to save room for the meat!! They bring other sides to the table which i HIGHLY recommend you trying!! They are authentic Brazilian sides and again worth skipping the salad bar for!  A couple of people on here said that there is some order to the way the meat is brought out, but last time I went I paid attention to that and I didn't notice an order at all. Maybe they were too busy when I was there to coordinate it, but all I know is that I ask for what I want if I don't see it and they bring it right away.   The staff is wonderful. It's a different experience there because you don't have one server bringing you everything as in a typical restaurant, but everyone there is more than willing to help and they do so with a smile.   I'm telling you this place is incredible! I don't understand why they don't get 5 stars all around, but some people are just more critical than others I guess. We don't live in a fairly tale land where everything is perfect all the time; people makes mistakes and restaurants are run by people. Having been there 8-9 times over the last couple years, trust me, this place IS 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The service here is the best I've had in a long time. They really treat you like an honored guest. The food is also amazing! It certainly is a carnivores delight. While EVERYTHING was delicious, the stand outs for me were the bacon wrapped Filet Mignon and the their juicy garlicky signature sirloin. Just so you don't O.D. on meat they do also have a wonderful salad bar which has various peppers, cheeses, and cured meats in addition to the good selection vegetables."}
{"text":"I've been fortunate enough to eat at Fogo in four different locations around the country and with some regularity - Manhattan, Dallas, Austin, and the shining jewel in the Fogo crown, Scottsdale AZ.   The quality of the food, from the salad components to the exquisite prime Angus beef is pretty much unmatched anywhere.  Decor is always pleasant and the service impeccable.  But nowhere is this more true than in the Scottsdale branch.  From the moment I arrive to the moment I leave I free like a king.  That's something that really resonates with me.  The staff is exceptional at all levels from the top down.  Professionalism and courtesy have clearly been instilled in everyone.  Dinner always starts with a caipiranha and some pao de queijo, a sort of Brazilian cheesy (gluten-free) bread. Then you face an overload of choice at their fantastic salad bar.  There is a temptation to go to town here but regulars know to save their appetite for the meat.  And the flick of the wrist from red to green on a colored coaster-type card signals the gauchos to begin the onslaught of meat.  For a real carnivore like myself it's heaven on the hoof!  They have about a dozen different cuts of meat including some beef, pork, lamb, and chicken.  The house specialty  is Picanha, which is a beef top sirloin that's rubbed with sea salt and spit grilled.  It's a simple preparation that makes the flavor of the beef really stand out.  From there you get inundated with filet mignon, bottom sirloin, garlic rubbed beef, parmigiano pork, etc and it doesn't end until you eventually cry \"enough!\"  There are side dishes too including garlic mashed potatoes, polenta, and fried bananas.  The latter are a great offset to the salted meat.  When you've had enough meat get the papaya cream for dessert with some creme de cassis to top it off.  All this for one low set price, less than a single steak at some restaurants.   With the exception of two or three things the menus is celiac and soy free.  I get to eat all over the world on business and I've eaten at some phenominal world class restaurants including a 2-star Michelin restaurant.  There are great places out there but when I consider the food quality, variety, service, and price, I keep coming back to Fogo as being somewhat unmatched.  Clearly I can't say enough good things about this place but I'm being honest about my experiences.  Check it out if you're ever in the Phoenix area or anywhere else there's a branch.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  Now if they'd just bring back the beets on the salad bar....."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Quick service and John was a fabulous server. He was very friendly, very personable and took care of us. He was very professional and polite. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I am a big fan of this place because of the overall experience.  I am not a huge meat eater, and after eating here, I probably won't be able to eat a steak for a month or two.  Simply because I am not used to eating this much meat.  Let me start with the salad bar- I would go there just for this!  Too many things to list, but,l trust me, you could fill up on it alone.  Many items  are non-standard to salad bars.    Ok, so then they brought out the side dishes.  I am a carb-a-holic and I could have died and gone to heaven right them.  Fried polenta squares, Sauteed bananas, cheese bread, mashed potatoes, etc.   Liked everything but the mashed potatoes. Then the meat started coming.  And kept coming.     I turned over my coaster to red pretty quickly, but my fellow diners were braver than I.  They kept eating and eating.  The meat all tasted good, but it all started to blend in my mind.  The only true standout for me was the lamb which was really, really yummy.  My mom, who is a genuine carnivore, asked if she could have a beef rib, not the meat on it which is what they usually carve, but the actual rib.  They gave it to her and she is still going on about how good it was.  I can't believe it, but my table ordered dessert.  I am ashamed to say I cannot remember what it was!  But it was really good, even though I only had one bite."}

{"text":"This was my first time eating at the Fogo de Chao in Scottsdale and it might be the last.  I have eaten at the Fogo de Chao in Dallas many times so I knew what to expect, amazing service and perfectly cooked and seasoned meat.  For the $30 you will spend on lunch, you should not expect anything less. As I walked in, I was not disappointed.  Everything was first class.  The salad bar was just as you would expect in a five star steakhouse.  I learned from previous visits not to waste too much time at the salad bar.  I came for the meat, cooked Brazilian style, and I was hungry. As soon as I sat down, I flipped my card to \"green\", which signals that I was ready for meat.  \"Red\" means stop bringing meat.  I didn't really care what came to me first; I knew it would all be delicious.  As luck would have it, the first \"gaucho\", Portuguese for cowboy, to come by had one of my favorites; top sirloin.  My mouth was watering as he sliced off two big pieces from the rotisserie skewer.  This is where the fantasy of what I was expecting ends and reality set in.  The meat was dry and rather bland.  What!  This had never happened to me at this restaurant before.  Of the dozens of times I had eaten in Dallas, the food was always perfect and top notch.  The Scottsdale Fogo de Chao was turning out to be a disappointment. I thought to myself that I simply had one bad cut of meat and it was bound to happen sooner or later.  I tried the filet mignon, the lamb, the chicken and the pork.  They were all dry and flavorless.  The only thing that made spending $30 on lunch worth it was the fabulous meat, yet what they were serving was not even as good at Texas Roadhouse. I'm sure that one day I will go back and give them another chance.  Every day that passes I convince myself that it wasn't as bad as it was.  As soon as my memory fades enough, I'll be back for at least one more try.  Besides, it is too much fun to drop a bread crumb on the table and watch the headwaiter scramble to come clean it up."}
{"text":"Went here during lunch for a meeting. Exceptional choices at the salad bar! Everything was fresh and beautifully presented. The choices of meats were limited for lunch. We got seated very promptly as there weren't many customers there for lunch. My fav was the leg of lamb med-well. Second fav was the filet. For sides we didn't have a choice. The waiter just came and dropped three bowls (all of them were cold!): mashed potatoes, polenta strips and sautéed bananas. One of the highlights for us was when they brought around the sautéed mozzarella. Perfect texture and char on it. I would highly recommend it.   The food was good for any restaurant that charges a premium for quality buffet style meals. The low stars are due to the poor quality of service. I felt like the servers were rushing us to finish the meal. I was not asked if I wanted another beer (the guy just kept filling my glass of water). I have had been to the one in Philadelphia and would rate it 5 stars. This one only gets 3 from me."}
{"text":"Great place just a short walk from the strip but worth it. Gives you a chance to try lots of different cuts of meat cooked exactly how you like them. I normally avoid lamb but even tried it. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Was just here for a birthday party with about 9 others. I had been to Fogo de Chao before in another city and it took me a good amount of time to go back. I remember being fuller than I've ever been and for whatever reason kept me away from there for a while. Overall the food was good, but not great.  The salad bar was pretty tasty and had some good selections. I didn't have one meat offering that I was blown away by.  The service was average and it didn't help that one of the meat carvers spilled meat juice on the back of my shirt (was never mentioned, but noticed by my wife). I made the hostess aware of this and they gave me a wipe to try and clean it.  You would have thought that they would have thrown in a free dessert or something on the house, but just a \"sorry about that\". They also offered to pay for the cleaning if it didn't come out.  If you haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, it's probably worth checking out, but to me seems a little gimmicky and probably will be a while before I'm back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's all Brazilian food. They are employees who come a round with a sword with meat on it and they come to your table and give you some meat. I recommend the bacon wrapped beef it is to die for"}
{"text":"Basically a glorified all you can eat buffet. I think they try to overwhelm you with so much food so that you don't realize that it's all pretty mediocre.  Zero ambiance.  Hope you like meat."}
{"text":"Was with a group of 12. The meal was delicious and the servers fantastic...no one went wanting for anything as the staff was on top of getting our drinks and serving the skewered meats. A+"}
{"text":"The whole Fogo de Chao experience is really unique, fun, and delicious. They have a fresh and tasty buffet style salad bar with items such as, pasta salads, asparagus, fresh bread, fruit, and all sorts of side items. The variety of meat is phenomenal with chicken, filet mignons, rib eyes, etc. Wow! Is this place good. I highly recommend for small groups,  big parties, whoever!"}
{"text":"Wonderful.    Had a $50 gift card and took my husband here (I have eaten here, my husband not).   There was nothing about his meal he could find fault with.   Loved the ribeye and bacon wrapped filet.   Salad bar was good as was the polenta and bananas (and garlic mashed potatoes) brought to our table.   Expensive lunch ($78 which was the lunch, a glass of wine and iced tea) but according to my husband, he'd like to return he enjoyed it so much."}
{"text":"Great selection of meat. We loved all of them except for one steak which was very tough, surprisingly it was the filet. Never got to try the pork even though we requested it. Service could have been more attentive, we had to waive at the waiters quite a few times. Even then, they didn't always return. For the price we expected better service. They really need to hire more wait staff."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Impeccable service. My husband and I ate dinner here for the first time recently, because of the great reviews on Yelp. It is the only time I've ever heard him express how much he enjoyed a meal. The salad bar had a great assortment and everything was fresh. The basil salad dressing was a nice change from the typical choices. The meats were tasty and seasoned without masking the flavor. Side dishes were served at the table and if you didn't eat them before they turned cold, they were replaced with warm dishes of the same. We never waited for food. There was always wait staff there with the next meat choice before you could empty your plate. The only complaint would be the noise of the other patrons around us. The acoustics are not good and seem to amplify the din. But it was Saturday night in Vegas. That said, it was still the best meal we have ever eaten. We will definitely go back. It also comes with dessert. We were so full that we didn't want it, but the waiter talked us into splitting a creme brûlée. However, he also brought out flan. It was absolutely the best flan ever. Go hungry!"}
{"text":"Took my uncle for a special dinner here and Yes, I am impressed! The ambience, the food and service was awesome. Though it was a bit expensive, its still all worth it. Victor Lou Di Nolfi and the rest of the servers were very attentive. The house special- Picanha is a must have"}
{"text":"Came in with my husband on our anniversary, loved the atmosphere, great service, organized team work, I liked the salad buffet more than the meat it self, I've had better"}
{"text":"Just had a dinner tonight and it was the best Brazilian steakhouse experience ever.  Thanks to our server min who made the dining experience just awesome.  Our drinks were never empty, salad bar was very fresh, food was served very fast, and the best of all, none of the meats were over seasoned!(not salty at all).  The only thing that i didnt enjoy was the soup.  The soup was a bit watery and blend.   I would definately go back to this location soon to get another superb dining experience."}
{"text":"Great Brazilian steakhouse. Chain but doesn't feel like it. Service was very attentive, felt like we had multiple servers plus all the meat dudes. Kids enjoyed salad bar and many of the meats. Adults ate too much."}
{"text":"I make all my eating decisions and appreciate all those who contribute to Yelp. I had been to the Fogo de Choa in Los Angeles and now in Las Vegas and I know I can count on very fresh salad bar entities and superb meats. The service is, if you allow yourselves to enjoy the catering of their service, the best around. Thank you Fogo de Choa."}
{"text":"Amazing food as always, lamb was my favorite, market place always rich and fresh, Lu took good care of us and gave me a free desert for my birthday and great service, a must have if you're around for good food!"}
{"text":"Delish! We were celebrating my brother's 21st and my cousins 30th bday in Vegas. Perfect dinner!"}
{"text":"What an excellent dining experience!!! $400 dollars for 4 people, with lots of drinks. The meats were AMAZING....Flank steak, ribeye and filet were my favorite. Salad bar was really good quality too. The service was excellent. Love this place will be going back."}
{"text":"WOW! Rule #1: come hungry.  Actually....come starving.  You may want to avoid eating at all before coming to this place.  So much food....so much food.   You walk in and you just see the wait staff running around at lightining speed getting the food and drinks to their respective table.  When they disperse, they open up a path to this magical salad bar with some really great cheeses, veggies, and some type of raw fish (similar to sushi or maybe it was), but it was really good.    HOW IT WORKS: Salad Bar, Meats, Dessert (service continued or halted by red or green indicator that you have on your table)   You sit down with a \"button\" that is similar to a circular cup coaster.  One side is red and the other green.  You want that button to be on green when you sit down.   That will trigger wait staff to come by and bring you A TON of different meat varieties.    They brought out lamb, different types of steaks in different seasonings, and ask you if you have any special meat requests if you want to try something in particular or want  another sample of something you've already had.   They bring it on a stick and carve off the section you want depending on how you want the meat cooked.   Along with that, they will be bringing out bread rolls with CHEESE in them! HOLY WOW!  of course - they have the garlic mashed potatoes on standby.      The DESSERT was nice!  a Chocolate Mousse cake that I barely had room for.     EXPECT the meal to START at $50 but I would go in ready for a lot more than that due to drinks that you may want to get, people with you, etc.     Fellas...If your girl has been good to you - treat her to a nice dinner.  She deserves it. Vice versa too, please.  Hunger is not prejudice."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Plus kids eat free. Meat and more Meat!! My husband loved it. So good."}
{"text":"Our favorite.  Cannot say enough good things.  The Limeades are the bomb, and the creme brulee is the best I've had anywhere.  If you go for lunch, it is half price for better service, and the same amazing menu."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience tonight. Have been here a couple of times and brought my sis-in-law for her first exp. Customer Service and food is excellent every time. Marcos & Marco made our visit even more amazing as they would stop by table to check on birthday girl making sure she felt extra special on her birthday and first time visit. These employee's go extremely over and beyond and make you feel at home. I have been to San Diego location but the exp. at the Scottsdale, AZ is by far the best!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with their salad bar, the meat wasn't all that..... They need to take notes from Texas de Brazil restaurant!"}
{"text":"What can I say?!?!? Fogo is a destination beyond belief... My head waiter Lou was fabulous. His attention to detail was as great as the food! Thanks for a wonderful time!!!"}
{"text":"I love Brazilian barbeque and this place did not disappoint. I've only been to one that I would consider better than this and the rest that I've been to were no where close to this. The quality of all of the different types of meat were amazing. The salad bar was also great. It's not a cheap meal, nor is it expensive in my opinion because of the quality of the meal. Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse until I walked into Fogo De Chao. My husband surprised me for our anniversary last Thursday by setting up a reservation for dinner and we were instantly greeted by warm smiles from both hostesses who made us feel more then welcome. Our original server was Christopher; he told my husband and me all about their delicious shrimp cocktail which I had to have.  He took our drink order and shot around the restaurant. Waters arrived shortly after as well as this delicious cheese bread that I could go back for alone.  My husband was not sure what to think of the salad bar but he highly recommended the salmon. On the other hand, I was almost more interested in the salad bar and its choices then the meat service at first. If you want choices for a good price this is the place to go.   By the time we got around the salad bar and sat down our shrimp cocktail and two caipirinhas were on the table. caipirinhas are these marvelous, sweet, sour, lime drinks that apparently expand your stomach as you drink them and trust me, you're going to need a few to try every item there. It would be the best beach drink and I have to find out how they make them.   Our server was very attentive, right when we flipped over to green we had new plates and the lamb chops my husband requested were at the table immediately. I was shocked at how the cooks brought the food to the table. My favorite cut by far was the filet mignon wrapped in bacon; the bacon compliments the filet perfectly. Before our drinks emptied another server asked if we would like to do another round. My husband decided to order the house Malbec, which Christopher had recommended earlier; my husband agreed that the wine complemented each meat in its own unique way.  The entire service was magical, and to top it off Christopher brought out my favorite dessert, Crème Brule.  The plate was adorable it had Happy Anniversary spelled out on it. I cannot wait to have my parents experience this when they visit in July. I highly recommend making it a destination the next time you're in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch here today. The staff was super attentive and friendly, the food was exquisite and their caipirinha was to die for! Thank you for my desert and for welcoming me to Las Vegas! Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Great service.  The food is excellent, the seasoning on those cuts are very distinct and unique to the type of meat they make.  The filet mignon wrapped in bacon is one of my favorites.  Go easy on the salad bar because the meat is definitely the best thing in the restaurant, if you like a good steak, that is."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. We came here for my birthday and it did not disappoint. We prepared ourselves by abstaining from food all day so by night time, we were ravenous. When we first arrived we were seated quickly since we had made reservations, thank god we did since it was pretty busy when we got there. Our waiter went through the spiel with us about how the whole process worked since it was our first time there, he seemed extremely busy but he was always kind and there when we needed him, +1 star there. I decided to visit the salad bar and ended up with some smoked salmon and asparagus. The salmon was delicious and the asparagus was abnormally large but also great nonetheless. Abnormal veggies, +1 star. Right when I sat down, the filet mignon came by so basically, it was meant to be. It was cooked perfectly and extremely tender. It was a melt in your mouth kind of good that could bring a grown man to their knees. Yum. +1 star. Then right after the filet the lamb chops came. I'm pretty sure this is the part I died and went to heaven. Cooked to perfection and the spice on the lamb chop was tasteful and not overwhelming. +1 star. Other meats then showed up which were good but let's be real, the filet and lamb chops held a place in my heart already. I do have to say though, the chicken and bacon wrapped filet were a bit dry. Other than that, there were no complaints. Since I'm the type of person that always has room for desert, we charged on and ordered the molten lava cake. If I didn't die before, I definitely did now. It was a melt in your mouth warmth and heaven of chocolate, if chocolate was a drug then I'd happily OD on this everyday. When we pierced the outer shell of the cake the chocolate on the inside flowed like a baby chocolate river, it doesn't get any better than that. So basically, +5000 stars. My first time experience was off the charts and I cannot wait for another excuse to go again!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place to anyone that loves a great steak and excellent customer service. My husband and I have ate at this place 3 times at this location and 2 at the flamingo location. But we prefer this location due to the people (their service) and price here. First off wide selection of meat. They have chicken, pork, lamb, and shrimp. A great salad bar. If you havent tried brazilian food you have to try it here, its sooooo goooood. (Awesome) All the servers for the meat are awesome but the one you have to check out is Chris (Geller). He is down to earth, very friendly, smiles all the time, and will go out of his way to get what you want and how you want it. The first time we went here he was the main server that stuck out cause of his personality. Also, Robert. This guy went out of his way to make sure I had fresh, soft cheese bread. It is one of the reason why we go there you can only get this bread at this place.  Another person came out after knowing I was waiting for fresh one that was in the oven but still gave me the other batch. But Robert came and apologized for the other servers mistake and got me the fresh one. His another one very friendly and down to earth. The managers are very friendly too, they go around saying hi to everyone and making sure your doing ok. These managers are what managers are suppose to represent - Milton, Chris, and Caleb. All these people work so hard to serve us and give us a great experience and excellent service. I'm telling you guys you won't regret it. The food is I can't even describe but soooo good you'd want to come back for more plus with the service. Honestly places like these are hard to find great food and with outstanding customer service. So don't wait try this Brazilian Food and meet these great people."}
{"text":"What a way to end our three day mini vacay!  The service was top notch, which bump up the review to 5 stars.  Food alone is a solid 4 stars.  They were very accomodating.  My bf's 3yr old son asked for fried rice(he always ask for it everywhere he goes).  We told him that they don't serve that here, but the waitress overheard us.  So she went in the kitchen and said something to the chef.  Ten minutes later, she came out with a plate of fried rice!  And the hubby said it was better than a lot of Chinese restaurants.  That's what you call customer service!  I've never had this type of service, ever.    The quality of the meat is pretty good.  We came in for lunch and it is well worth the $26.50.  Both my hubby and friend mentioned that they are willing to pay the dinner price for this dining experience.  They were both hesistant at first, but once they sat down, they knew that they were in for a treat.  All the meat were juicy and flavorful.  I prefer a little more salt, but that's an easy fix with the salt shaker at the table which elevated the flavor even more.   All in all, a wonderful dining experience.  A must go next time we're in the city.:)"}
{"text":"After looking at all the reviews on this place, my daughter chose this place for her birthday, we came here the service from the waiters bringing your meats was awesome but I have to say our waitress was very dry and had no personality no smiles of any sort, after 20 minutes my wife had to go ask for our bill, my wife also explained to 2 employees standing by the bar is our waitress ok cause she's not anywhere to be found and we've been waiting for our bill for 20 minutes,so needless to say after this experience we will not be returning here, due to our service. Not happy at all, I see that there were 25 other reviews that people were not happy, and not even a simple apology. \"Customer Service\" is key to running a successful business."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Salad bar is alwts well kept and clean. The servers are friendly and very attentive. The Gaucho chefs always ask how you would like the steaks cooked and if they didn't have it they returned quickly. Great atmosphere! Go here to eat"}
{"text":"Our waitress Norma was awesome! Beyond awesome! No joke, ask for Norma. If your waitress isn't Norma, then your experience won't be 5 stars. Oh, and the food wasn't bad. I feel like some of the meats need a condiment as they tend to be a little dry. If it wasn't for Norma I would not have given this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Attentive service, high quality food. I'm not a carnivore, but it's not a problem here with the excellent salad bar. The guys LOVE all the meats and the free dessert is nice."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, food was good but arrived really late. I would still recommend this place because I loved the food."}
{"text":"Great service awesome food , Daniel one of the severs provided best customer service .. There was a female that had no personality but I won't let her stop me from giving this place 5 start"}
{"text":"So far, this place is still Vega's best kept secret. But not for long. I was surprised that we were able to walk in on a saturday night at 7pm. Take the location out of the picture, this joint is exactly the same as the one in Beverly Hills. From service to food. This is a go to place"}
{"text":"I would have rated this higher if the service would have been better. We were seated, went to the market table, and had 3 gauchos come by before the sides were served. We had to request the sides be brought out. Our drinks were not refreshed in a timely manner. The service did not match the price of the meal."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice place for dinner on short notice.  Came across this place on Yelp with a respectable rating.  I called for a reservation and was able to get one without any hastle..  The person on the phone was friendly and accommodating.  When we got there the place was layed out really nice elegant but not stuffy.  The staff was super friendly and the service was amazing.  The glass was never empty and there was food always on the plate.  Most of the staff is actually from Brazil and speak Portugese if you care about that, but most importantly they make the place authentic.  The salad bar that you start with is high quality and that in itself can make a meal.  If you are a meat lover you will love the 8 or more types of meat that are served.  You get as much as you want of each type.  All of the meat was good but the leg of lamb was the bomb!  I highly recommend it.   For a place that has been in business only since Nov. 2011, they have have it down pretty good."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews for restaurants, but thought that this one fully deserved it - in the best way. I took my dad for a late Father's Day dinner last and had the most amazing time. We arrived 10 minutes early for our 7:30p reservation, but were immediately seated. Our water was filled as we sat (the server, who showed up at the table before us and the hostess pulled out our chairs for us) and the server explained the process to us in a friendly manner. We ordered our drinks and hit the salad bar.   The salad bar is to die for - all types of lettuce, rare veggies and additives like marinated bamboo, fresh mozzarella and FULL artichoke hearts (amazing); all fresh. There is also apple salad, potato salad, and more that I can't even remember.   Before we got back to the table with our salads, our drinks were waiting for us on the table. We left the token on red as we chowed down on our salads and chatted for a while until the sides arrived; mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas and fried polenta...all fantastic. After explaining the side dishes, our server took our salad plates and brought us fresh ones for the meat.  Immediately after switching the tokens we received non-stop service from the meat servers, who always made sure to ask how we wanted the meat and if we wanted more, etc. and were happy to explain the cuts. The meat itself was divine. The only complaint that I could think of was that the rub for the lamb was quite salty, but I don't really enjoy salty foods and my dad loved it, so I think it's more of a preference - the meat was so good, I just cut the edges off and kept eating.  Our drinks were constantly filled always before they were completely empty (we were drinking water and iced tea because neither of us wanted to fill up on wine or booze). More than that, every so often the sever would come by and ask if there was any specific meat we wanted more of at that moment as not to make us wait until it came around or if we wanted more sides (the sides, the salad, and the meat are unlimited). They also give you fresh plates anytime they see trimmings or bones, etc. hanging around on the plate, which I appreciated.   All and all, it was a great experience and well worth the price ($50 per person)! Mind you I am pretty stingy, so something HAS to be worth it for me to pay over $100. We were not rushed whatsoever (We arrived at 7:20p and didn't leave until 9:30p). This is definitely on my list of best restaurants for special occasions."}
{"text":"One word... MEAT!! When planning our recent trip to Vegas, I was eyeing a few different places for dinner on Yelp and chose this as our first dinner of the stay. We were very pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a very helpful and friendly server who laid out the whole idea of dining at a Brazilian BBQ. His first suggestion (and a very good one) was to go LIGHT at the salad bar. The whole point of dining at this type of restaurant is being able to try a whole list (15) of different cuts of meats. Meats range from Chicken, Beef, Pork & Lamb cooked several different ways. I enjoyed each and every cut and left my seat barely being able to walk. If this wasn't such a nice place, it would definitely qualify as a stretchy-pants must. The fried plantains were so good that I saved them for last. Our server took the last bit that I had asked him to leave on the table, but brought out a brand new hot plate when he realized his mistake.. Score! The manager suggested a couple drinks to try and was spot on with his advice. The girlfriend ordered a Strawberry Lemonade cocktail (delicious) and I went with a Brazilian Beer that was a great suggestion. Be prepared to be a little overwhelmed with service for about the first fifteen minutes of your experience. It's just the nature of this place and all of the advice that you will receive from the staff is very helpful. Again, go LIGHT at the salad bar! How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat!! (For you PF fans ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome service and awesome food the second time around!! I went here twice so far! The first time was not so great when it came to service. The second time was by far the best experience I had. If you do not want to head to the strip hit this place up it is definitely worth it!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I attended an investment seminar here tonight.  Salad bar was full of very different foods, three choices of hot foods. Carrot/ginger soup was delicious. As I don't eat red meat I opted for chicken..piece of breast..very dry,overcooked. Ditto on the leg,  i can't give opinion on the beef, husband did say it was good.  We both had cheesecake for desert. I think that is what gave us the food poisoning. Both of us got severe stomach cramps in the car..made it home just in time. First and last time we eat here. Glad the meal was free."}
{"text":"Always great food... love the lamb chops and the beef rib.... yum.  Great salad bar too.  Service was good and Lou was great!  We went for lunch and did not need dinner later  ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place and I will visit for dinner every time I am in Vegas, however, this last visit was extremely frustrating.  I made a reservation but it took over half an hour to be seated.  The wait for our drinks was unacceptable.   The salad bar had been destroyed and most items had not been replaced. The sides (mashed potatoes, polenta, and fried bananas) were cold. We waited for 20 minutes to get our check.  As a result, we were late for another engagement. I realize the rodeo was in town, but this was an unacceptable experience for the price of dinner.  When I brought up the issue with management I was told, \"I don't know what to say.  The rodeo is in town.\"   Honestly.  It happens every year, right?  Plan accordingly.  I'm very disappointed with my experience and the response from management."}
{"text":"Fomos no fogo de chao em Las Vegas e fomos muito bem atendidos . O buffet de saladas estava impecavel. Atendimento e gerencia nota 1000! Recomendo a todos. Indiscutivelmente a melhor churrascaria de Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Top notch service! The bacon wrapped filet mignon is on point. Best restaurant in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"The meat was great, but the servers made us feel uncomfortable. Constantly trying to upsell."}
{"text":"The manager Chris and all the staff ( hostesses, cavers and severs ) are awesome !! Thank you so much :)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat meat. Lots and lots of fantastic tasting meat. We found it. Ol' Wichita knows his meat when he sees it and this place is it. First off we started over to the salad bar, which I thought was going to be a diversion so I wouldn't eat so much meat. Everything was so fresh and tasty that I just didn't care. I did not go nuts over the salad bar but did help myself, as meat was what I was really after. Then you turn over the card so it is showing green. I guess it's a metaphor for the money you're about to spend. Anyway, that didn't matter. We were besieged by matadors carrying long scewers of meat. They cut off pieces to order and boy was it good. There must have been a dozen different people racing from table to table hacking and slicing their way through tons of the finest crafted meats I have ever tasted...beef, pork, lamb, and chicken. I liked the bottom sirloin, filet mignon (wrapped in bacon), house special (sirloin), and pork ribs. It was all really good, but when I say I enjoyed the above, it was just that those things were so beyond my expectations that I just had to mention them.   These guys all went out of their way to make our dinner a dining extravaganzal? experience. It was at once delicious and entertaining. We-will-be-back!!!! Speaking of being back, check out ol' Wichita's webpage to hear some good old industrial strength classic country music. Wichitacountry dot com. I do it all alive and in real time with no help from anybody else. Thanks."}
{"text":"I love Brazilian steakhouses. Ive been to several of them in las vegas, and a few around the country. Ive heard nothing but good things about fogo de chao, so ive been excited to try them out and compare. ive had to drop people off  numerous times there and it smells delicious. Where i work, there is also managers and other people who work there that come in and visit my work and they are always pleasant and always offering my co workers and i specials.  So why 1 star? Well the truth is I've never got to chance to eat there. Ive tried to make reservations 4 times, and I've also walked in once....each time being unsuccessful.   Now I understand this place is very popular and gets busy, but why do i get shafted? I make a reservation, show up early, wait, im looking around and the place is half empty. I ask the people up front, why am i waiting so long? She replies that there are other reservations and that we will have to wait a bit longer. After 30 minutes and still not have been seated, I left. Why should i be punished when others who are running late get treated better than me. Oh and by the way this has happened TWICE.   My other two reservations attempts were denied because they were \"too busy and many people had already made reservations before i called\".   And of course my one walk in was a disaster. I pull in because the parking lot looked very empty. I walk in sure enough more tables available than I've ever seen. I enquire about eating and was told the wait would be 3.5 hours. There was a private party there that evening. Ok i thought, but the lady told me the party started a little over an hour after I enquired and there were tables available in the section that was not blocked off. Whatever   Im sure this place is awesome, but I've thought about writing this place off for good. Ive only visited again because my girlfriend wanted to try again.  Is my business not worthy to them??"}
{"text":"We came here for the hubby's 25th birthday.  The service is top notch,even Gordon Ramsay would be impressed. We had two different servers and they were very prompt in brining out each dish and were quick to refill our glasses. I felt like a princess!  This place beats Espetus hands down back in San Francisco!!! Every piece of meat was extremely fresh and so full of incredible fresh off the grill flavor! I felt like I was at an old fashioned gaucho parilla ! Next time I am in Vegas I WILL COME BACK!! 5+ stars"}
{"text":"Marco, Norma and Brandon were the best. Had a great time. Will come visit again just for the experience"}
{"text":"Tending not to like overly meaty flavor, I often try to avoid Brazilian restaurants. For some reason, I end up at one roughly once a year.   I have to say, this one was better than the others I've been to. the meat, in many instances, was far more tender than I am used to having. The linguica was much less greasy than I've had elsewhere as well. They also knew how to cook a chicken breast and didn't dry it out like all the rest. They also take requests if you want something you haven't seen come by recently.  Their salad bar was also quite good.   They also make a very good caipirinha. If you happen to go and want to try it, just mention it as the Brazilian drink with the name you can't pronounce. They'll know.   The service was also ridiculously efficient and nice. The only drawback is we kept sending the fried banana away and noticing this, someone else would bring over more banana. The mashed potato side was a nice idea, but the mash was really runny.   The only real drawback is the price is really steep. At least it won't feel like a waste, however."}
{"text":"Fogo De Chao was an amazing experience! It is basically an upscale buffet with the accompanying upscale price. There is an unlimited salad bar and all-you-can-eat bread, potatoes, and polenta. The same with the meat. It flowed non-stop! The chefs walked around with chunks of meat on a large skewer and cut off pieces for us at our table. We let them know if we wanted it well-done or medium-well and they obliged. We were done after several pieces, though. Think about it. How many steaks can you eat at once? What a profitable pricing scheme!  Beware of the soft drink prices, though! NO FREE REFILLS. I became suspicious when I did not see the prices listed. I used my phone to look it up online and there were several complaints from customers who were not told this in advance.  Would I return? Maybe once more to share the experience with someone going for the first time so that I may enjoy their reaction. Otherwise, once was enough for us."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner with my girlfriend and her father. Amazing service especially from our waiter Junior. Be sure to ask for him! He was very helpful in suggesting wine selections and his own favorites from the menu. His personality and enthusiasm really made our night special. This place is like a wine tasting but for meat. The selections are wonderful and artfully prepared. Be warned that when you flip your card to get meat, there will be a lot of it! Definitely try the lamb chop, one if not the best. Highly recommend this place for any non-vegans."}
{"text":"Had a WONDERFUL lunch here last week. The wait staff and gaucho's were especially TERRIFIC at getting us just what we asked for. Junior was one of our main gauchos and made it his goal to make sure our tummies were happy. I highly recommend Fogo Dr Chão for lunch or dinner.   PS You can bring your own wine and they will serve with corkage fee of $15."}
{"text":"We visited here for lunch.  I'm a meat guy and not really intersted in anyones salad offerings.  I have visited every Brazilian steakhouse in town, besides samba and yolies.  The meat here is the best and I feel the service is the best as well.  The people seem to like their job and seem very genuine.  They were very attentive and always cooked the meat to my liking.  If it wasn't done well enough they brought us more.  I like medium well.  If you like salad I can't help you.  If you like meat and yuca cheese bread this is the place to visit.  Favorites sirloin lamb and cheese breads."}
{"text":"OK, we have dined at 6 or 7 different Fogo locations and as expected the food was top notch at this Las Vegas location. What really stood out with the absolutely fantastic service which was way above any other location we have experience in the past, especially by Marco who was exemplary in both his attention to detail, wine service and caring...especially since we were at Fogo's to celebrate with a large family gathering for our sons 21st birthday celebration. As frequent visitors to Las Vegas, we look forward to returning again."}
{"text":"I cannot think of words that can describe my dining experience tonight, but I'm going to try. Spectacular, amazing, and beyond expectations. The food and service is the standard by which all other restaurants should be measured. You would be doing yourself a great disservice by not coming when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Positives: There was a wide variety of salad, meats, and sides that come with your meal; drinks and dessert are not included. The service is phenomenal and absolutely what you'd want when you spend that much money for food.   Negatives: We are absolutely meat lovers, and enjoy good flavor, however with the exception of a couple of cuts, there really wasn't too much to it, other than over salted entrees. Also, we went here for spring restaurant week and normally the prices during this week should be much cheaper than normal for a 3 course meal, and instead it was only 6 dollars cheaper than any other normal dinner night. I thought this was very deceiving when I made reservations. I wouldn't mind paying the money, if they were upfront about it.   Worth trying once just to say you went there, but we probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed!  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.  It was nothing like the one we have had home.  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didn't have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I don't know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :("}
{"text":"Love having meat tossed in my face every 10 seconds. If your a meat lover then this is the place don't waste your time with the salad bar just sit down and turn your meat card to green and watch a all protein war come to your plate chicken and some pork are dry so stick to the red meats although the apple rubbed pork is tasty great service and people watching"}
{"text":"Fogo De Chao deserves a solid 4 stars for my experiences there. However, the salad bar deserves like 5 or 6 stars - there is no better salad bar in town!  The meal comes in two phases: salad bar and meat like most Brazilian steakhouses. You get a little coaster type button that you put up on one color while you eat salad and another color while you eat meat. While this is happening you get side dishes and drinks. My favorite side dish is the bananas, AMAZING. When you are ready for the meat - meat carvers will come to your table to offer you various cuts and cooking temperatures. They have every kind of steak, plus lamb and chicken. The steak is very good here, but it is not the best I've had even in Arizona, hence the 4 star review instead of 5.   It is so hard not to over eat here, so I recommend coming hungry, and don't skip the amazing salad bar because you are looking forward to steak!"}
{"text":"Been a Brazilian myself I can say all the hype is just that, a hype. Went today for Valentine's Day and it sure disappointed me. No variety in the salad bar and in their meat selection. To pay $52.95 per person, I expected more, not to mention the coffee was old. The only thing I did like was the customer service which was great but I wouldn't go back nor would recommend it to a friend or family."}
{"text":"Lunched with a large, and rather high maintenance group.  Management was terrific in accommodating us, couldn't have asked for better.  Market table presented such a variety of interesting options, most affordably priced. The carnivores in our group did not seem to want to leave, and the gauchos definitely complied. Would like to try both brunch and dinner. Great to have this option in the 'burbs of Summerlin"}
{"text":"Definitely an adventure in dining and the food was very good, although some of the meat was inconsistent - one piece good, another of the same type not as good. The service, however, was spotty. Took forever to come back for our wine order, then brought the wrong bottle and we had to ask 3 times for a beer we'd ordered at the same time. It does seem to be a spot for baseball players to hang out during spring training, so you might spot someone and our waiter was helpful in pointing out who was there last night. But, you have to eat a LOT of beef to get your $55 worth here, so not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I have never in my life had great customer service like this it is beyond customer service this place needs 10 Stars I wish I could give them 10 stars but I only can give 5 thanks to yelp i love this place I love everyone here I love their attitudes all of their well mannerism in here I want to cry because I have to leave I'm here all the way from Houston Texas I will be back on my next vacation!************************************ YOU GUYS DESERVE IT!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Vegas twice a year and we always have dinner there. By far the best Brazilian steak house that I have tried. Being Brazilian, I always miss the authentic food and I can tell you, that's the place to go. Amazing tasty cuts of meat, sides are awesome and the service, well the service is absolutely outstanding. They serve so many different meats... You can have all the filet mignon you can eat! The black beans are delicious and I love their fried polenta. I have tried Fogo de Chao in São Paulo, Brazil and in California, and all I see is the same consistency of one of the best restaurants I  have ever eaten at. Stay away from the other Brazilian steak houses on the strip. This is the place to go to."}
{"text":"love coming here, but need to remind myself to come extra hungry!  the salad bar is awesome and the meat is to die for...a little spendy but definitely worth it if your out on the town.  the atmosphere is great for dinner conversation but lively enough it isn't stuffy.  Can't wait for the next night of feasting ;)"}
{"text":"Unlimited meat? UNLIMITED POWERRRR!!!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_DqV1xdf-Y"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a different dinning experience and defiantly received that here. This is a kind of like a buffet but the meat come to your table. The food was awesome, service fantastic and the salad bar was great too. Expect to drop some cash when dinning here though."}
{"text":"Excellent service, quality of food and selection. Lunch between 11:30 and 2 during the week matches the service quality and food of their dinner experience. If you've never experienced Brazilian barbecue Fogo will not disappoint. Bring friends and make it an experience! Save room for dessert, this dog is a fan of the flan."}
{"text":"Just had my first visit to this restaurant it was great had several meats, my favorite was leg of lamb and the lamb chops!!"}
{"text":"The parmesan pork just melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were there last night.  What a great experience.  We had both been to Brazilian restaurants before but this was by far the best.  The staff were awesome foot was excellent.  Well worth the cab ride there.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Such an unfortunate experience, as I adore Brazilian steakhouses. Came here on Mother's Day, celebrating not only Mother's Day, but also a birthday. It was noted on the chit, as the hostess asked about the celebration prior to seating. After that, it was never mentioned again. Seemed odd to inquire about such things if nothing is going to be done. That was a very minor thing in the grand scheme of our visit here.   Seating was a little delayed with no obvious reason, as the restaurant was almost completely empty and we had a reservation. Once seated, service was slow and painful. She was polite while at the table, but that was rare. She informed us upon arrival that the kitchen was already a little backed up, so the sides would be taking a moment. Ok, no worries, things happen right? Well, we didn't receive the mashed potatoes until 45 minutes after seating, we were constantly asking for bread, & the bananas were never refreshed after the initial serving 30 minutes after seating. The meat was far and few between and most of our time here was spent with no food on our plates, with gaps of 15/20 minutes without seeing a single item. We finally flagged down our server and requested meats, but those never arrived, after waiting an additional 15 minutes. We then asked for our check and chalked it up to a loss. I've never left a Brazilian steakhouse hungry before, but we all definitely did that night.   Not sure if they were just having an off night, but I wouldn't waste my money on another visit here when I can easily go to Texas de Brazil, or any other Brazilian steakhouse for that matter, and get better quality EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"True brazilian style bbq! Best steak is called picanha and must try their caipirinha (cocktail)."}
{"text":"WAY to good!!!! its pricey but well worth it.   This is easily the best place for steaks in the valley.  My favorite restraunt out of anywhere in Scottsdale/Phoenix area. They make love to the meat while cooking it."}
{"text":"went for a birthday dinner. It was a Sunday and not very packed. Service was excellent. The food was very good, I wasn't a fan of a couple of cuts of meat, but everyone has different taste. The tres leches cake was amazing. My husband is a huge fan, so I am sure we will be visiting again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"What an amazing event! Fabulous food, wonderful service, cool atmosphere and terrific company set off a spectacular evening. 12 hours after it has finished and I am still full.   Fogo De Chao offers remarkable service that is extremely attentive leaving customers wanting for nothing. One of the staff even took us in small groups to tour the kitchen and see how the various meats are cooked to perfection.  Gabi - thank you so much for organizing this event."}
{"text":"Update: just to avoid confusion, the name Marco to avoid is the server, not the head Maitre'd (this guy is very nice)...  Normally I would give this 5 stars but last Friday was terrible, and I don't mean the food, it was the service from this one server.  I would say 2 words \"AVOID MARCO\", that's right, this douchebag is probably one of the worst server we have ever encountered (he was serving in the back for large parties I guess so just wanted to make sure in case there is another Marco there).  We came here to celebrate my birthday, if it wasn't for the company and great food, I would have probably not come back at all.  I would definitely come back because this is one of my favorite restaurant but next time I will make sure we don't get this rude server's table. Let me highlight some of the douchebag Marco's rudeness:  1. I ordered a bottle of wine to celebrate my b-day, typically when a server brings the wine, he or she will present the wine and open it so that we can taste it.  No, he just put the bottle of wine in front of me and left and said \"Here...\" and walked away.  My friends with me are like, what's up with that...He came back, and rudely asked me \"Do you want me to open that?\"  I just wanted to say \"Yes open it you douche :-)\" but I didn't, it was my b-day and I don't want to spoil everyone's dinner.  Wait, not done yet, after he opened the wine, he just laid down cork in front of me and then walked away again.  I mean really?? didn't even bother asking if I wanted to taste it first grrrr.  So I proceeded to pour the wine to my friends and then he saw me and asked \"Do you want me to pour it?\".  Really, are you kidding me??  I mean c'mon, tell me this guy is not a douche?!  2. So my wife asked me if they're doing the summer feast special, which I'm not sure, so I begin to ask douchebag Marco and he explained that it was for everyone and that I didn't have to remind him also he asked me \"So do you have any questions??\".  That minute, I almost was going to really punch this guy, how rude, it's like I don't have the right to ask question.    3. So we finished our food, and we gathered to take some pictures.  My wife was taking the picture and we told her to ask any server.  Unfortunately, douchebag Marco walked in carrying just a tray with empty drinks that he just cleaned up on another table...my wife politely asked him if he could take our picture, you know what he said?? \"Why don't you take some pictures and I will come back..\"  What the F!@#...seriously, he couldn't just set down the drinks for a sec and take the picture?  I hope the manager can read this, because this douchebag \"MARCO\" needs to go back to server training and learn some manners and etiquette and how to serve and respect the customers.  Next time you go to Fogo, 2 words \"AVOID MARCO\" a.k.a douchebag"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and we were the first ones in the door.  Service is great and there are multiple selections to choose from at the salad bar.  The meats were all tasty and there are plenty of servers with different types of meats coming around.  The got pretty busy for lunch on a Thursday.  Cost was about $34 per person plus tax.  I would definitely return but with a bigger appetite."}
{"text":"My all time new favorite place to eat in Vegas!  Although it's expensive, it was worth every penny. Go hungry!! The Sangria was also great."}
{"text":"Went to Fogo de Chao for the first time with a group of 13! They were very accommodating! The service was great and the meats just kept on coming! The Parmesan crusted pork was a favorite. The fresh salads and sides  etc. were all wonderful and many drink specials to choose from."}
{"text":"I had such an amazing time here! The food was delicious and service was great! Ive been to a few steak house and when they get busy, your servers dont come around as often, but i cant say there was a time where i wanted something and the server was there with the lamb or steak.   Super clean and yummy buffet. Denise was so awesome and helped me set up a surprise for my sister (her birthday). Will defffff be coming back here whenever im in town!"}
{"text":"The salad bar, meat assortment and service is out of this world! I spilled on my shirt and they brought me a shout-out wipe, A SHOUT-OUT WIPE! The meat is marinated and cooked to perfection and desired type ie: rare, medium etc... I removed 1 star because of the price for dinner. Lunch is well priced at half the dinner and is the same food!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Everything was fresh and piping hot. Enjoyed dinning at this location much more than in Beverly Hills. Restaurant was very spacious."}
{"text":"This place speaks for itself. What meat-eater doesn't love a Brazilian Steakhouse? I do have to say though - this place could be loved by the vegetarians in your life, too. Their salad bar is spectacular. It's not your run of the mill salad bar. They have specialty salads, grilled vegetables, soups, Italian meats and cheeses, etc. You can actually go and only order the salad bar for half price. I'll likely opt to do this next time. The reason I say that is because I went pregnant and getting a well done piece of meat out of these guys is not easy. I totally understand that beef is MUCH better served medium or so, but ladies don't have that option when they're pregnant. That's the only reason I knocked a star off for them. They kept telling me they would bring me well-done cuts, but I only got one out of about 5. They do come around with chicken, pork, etc, but I was most interested in the beef. Will we be back? Of course. It's not a place we will visit often, but it's a fun experience."}
{"text":"Best dinner of your life. Pricey but worth it. The filet is like butter but the real winner is the ribeye! Must try!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. quality is good. service could be better. The receptionist isn't the nicest at times. Other times they are ok. the meat guys should be visiting tables more often. We definitely did not get all '18' kinds of meat that they advertised. They are also huge on pushing their 'house special'. We got that one about 5 times during our stay and none of the others. Definitely good value for your money.. especially if you like to eat a lot."}
{"text":"Arrived here for the first time yesterday, came back the following day for lunch. I'll probably have to come back tomorrow and again and again, then eventually file for bankruptcy within a few weeks because I'm addicted to this place. By the way, Karina rules as the greatest server ever."}
{"text":"Can't complain about anything...woo hoo rare meat! Service was great. Watermelon on the salad bar. Good company, plus we had a gift card. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I had my husband take me here for my birthday and let me tell you it was such an amazing experience. My waiter Vince gave me the best customer service you could ever want, the kitchen was absolutely phenomenal and the food was great. I had the molten chocolate cake for dessert with ice cream and it was so flavorful. The drinks were very strong but they were great too . It's a little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"Great service from the moment we walked in. Fantastic fresh salads. They kept piling on the meat. Amazing!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Fogo de Chao was several years ago at the location in Chicago but I was thrilled when one opened in Scottsdale (much closer to where I live).  If you love meat, this is the place for you.  I enjoy almost every cut of meat  and a few times I've ventured around the salad bar (it's beautiful, but as we know it's about the mean).   I've also sampled the various starches on the table (bananas, polenta) and I love them, but again it's really about the delicious cuts of meat coming around every time your card is on green.  If you go, go hungry and clear the rest of your schedule.  Even if you don't stay too long, you'll be in a lovely meat-induced sleepy state for the rest of the evening.  It is a bit on the expensive side, but when you think about what you get, both quality, quantity and selection it's really worth it."}
{"text":"First, on a personal note, I can't eat a lot in one sitting, so all-you-can-eat places generally aren't for people like me. $65 to eat an amount of food I could get for a third of the price doesn't make sense to me. If you can eat $65 worth of meat, by all means, come here.   I was pleased with the meats. All were prepared well, and the flavor was amazing. I got to have leg of lamb, lamb chops, various steaks, and some pork loin. All were satisfying and tasty.   My problem is with two things: value for the dollar, and soft drinks.   The website for the establishment says all beverages and desserts are extra.   Fine.   But for $65 a head, I think I should be able to have a bottomless beverage, not $4 for each 12 oz can of ginger ale. This is America. Get with the program. Bottomless beverages are expected in this country. Install a fountain.   I got to try a bite of the key lime pie, and it was no better than a slice of Edward's frozen key lime pie that you can get in any grocery store.   Why do I mention this?   Because a single slice of key lime pie here is $8.50. I can get the whole pie and a can of whipped cream for that and still have change left over.   I am a frugal person, and I believe this place lacks a few amenities that its price tag would usually indicate. I probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"One of the best food experiences  I've ever  had! Delicious selection of different types of meat  and chicken. Waiters are constantly on a move when your button in green which means you re ready to add more of this goodness in your system. Totally worth $."}
{"text":"Great service from great staff, especially our server Lou! Ask for the house special Picanha when you're here."}
{"text":"Consistently good quality of steaks only one waitress was rude but the other staffs including manager showed very exceptional service."}
{"text":"Delicious food; worth every penny.  The service was amazing, too.  Kuddos to our amazing waiter Derek.  He was very pleasant and attentive.   I would definetely go back and request Derek as our waiter."}
{"text":"1) no prices are offered - the meat/salad bar is $51/person, cocktains about $12 each 2) starve yourself before going...seriously! 3) eat at a leisurely pace - I made the mistake of eating at the pace that the meat slicers are working 4) 95% of the offerings (including the bread on the table) are gluten free 5) may wish to arrive later than 5:30pm - seemed that not all of the meats were prepared (we never saw the chicken or ribs)"}
{"text":"This place in simply incredible...top quality meats that just keep coming, and a salad bar that is unmatched! Probably my favorite restaurant in AZ. If you're ready to drop $50 per person for dinner, this is definitely the place to do it!"}
{"text":"You thought only Jenna Jameson could get 16 different meats in one day? Think again... This place would keep anyone satisfied and filled with delicious hot meat.   Why only four stars? Don't pick up my check while I'm still sitting there dude! I know you are anxious about your tip, but simmer down!"}
{"text":"It was alright. I don't think this is the type of place I'll regularly go. They definitely had good meat and fancy ambiance. It loses a star though, because my cup got empty a few times and I was thirsty."}
{"text":"First time here. Very clean and the aroma of the prepared meat was amazing when you walked in. The Brazilian Steakhouse was new to me but I really enjoyed the experience of them coming around and cutting the meat right at the table.  It wouldn't be fair for me to not mention the service. It was great, we were regularly checked on but not to the point it was annoying.   Would recommend, especially if you've never experienced the Brazilian steakhouse experience.  Probably would have given 5 stars but my opinion was that it was pretty pricey."}
{"text":"We just went with the family. It's one of our favorite restaurants. Service is excellent. Our kids love it!! Each time we go they make us feel like family. We have been to other fogo de chao in other cities and this one is by far my favorite one!!!"}
{"text":"OMG the absolute best place in the world! The meats are off the chain good.  The service was even better, all the staff was super friendly!! If you are a meat person ask to see the grill. I thought there was no way i could go in back and they were so accommodating.  I cannot say enough great things about the experience. Super happy customer."}
{"text":"Good staff, good enviorment, and good food. Just make sure you work up an appetite and don't eat too much bread or salad so you can enjoy the various meats."}
{"text":"I had no idea how great everything was going to taste!! In Vegas, you can't go wrong with Ricardo in attendance! Everything from the atmosphere, to the staff and the amazing salad bar was fantastic! Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"I went to Fogo de Chao during their Meat Tornado event and, I was not prepared for the awesomeness. It was an amazing experience of meat, great waiters, and did I say meat? I made the mistake of going to the salad bar because I did not have enough room for all of the meats. I can't wait to go back to this place."}
{"text":"The best rodizio in town without a doubt! Excellent meat and excellent salad bar. The only thing... I had a problem with a waiter when we asked for an extra chair. He was rude and he pushed the table so hard to put the extra chair that he didn't even noticed he hit my belly while pregnant. Fortunately I was able to move fast but it was scary. What a shame that such a good food gets ruined by a server like that one."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes. I last visited this location in 2012. I remember it being like a Ruth's Chris or Morton's. Now it's more like a Sizzler. So disappointing.  The only bright side was the meat. If you don't care about ambiance, it's fine. But not worth it: Our first server came by when only half of our party was seated. She said \"you're ok with drinks?\" We had literally not even a glass of water. No drinks here!  I replied \"Ummm, no. We need drinks.\" She walked away. No answer.  The next server said \"You all know how this works? Great, go help yourself to the salad bar.\" Before I could explain that no, my spouse has never been here, He walked away too!  The meal went fine. Not great, very hurried. Shockingly, people were walking around in ripped jean shorts and flip flops. It was not what we'd hoped for. We were all dressed for date night.  The worst part? The ladies room hadn't been serviced in hours. 2 stalls were not usable. The handicapped stall had a DIRTY DIAPER in it. I warned the very nice but obviously frazzled manager and he was mortified.  4 people, 1 bottle of wine, 4 cocktails. $360. Nope."}
{"text":"First visit on Friday for lunch. Walked in,the seater was seating another couple that was there before me and my friend.,as soon as she knowledge us she greeted us with a sweet smile,and asked if we had reservations. No reservations no problem! She seated us right away! And explain the menu and how it works,like I said our first visit we were looking for a different menu,you know just regular steak house menu type a thing..it's a buffet steak house! We were hungry but not that hungry., we ended up just ordering from the salad bar table $15and add a chicken breast $6 not bad! We were full plus coffee and sparkling water,very nice place and elegant service was great! Oh they have a full wine list menu it's like 3-4 pages.. We were satisfied for our experience!"}
{"text":"Have been to a number of Brazilian Steakhouses and this one wins!  Salad bar was plentiful and the meat, OH THE MEAT... Fantastic.  Food was amazing enough to overlook the fact that we did not have a specific served.  Good they work as a team, but made it a bit difficult for drink refills, etc.  Not a huge deal, just a little strange to not have a single point-person to look to for drinks, the bill, etc."}
{"text":"Fogo never disappoints. Tried it in Philadelphia, DC and now in Scottsdale. Yes, it's pricey but it's so tasty. I'm small and don't eat much so I probably don't eat my money's worth. But who cares. It's a delicious meal. If you want delicious meat, mashed potatoes and fried bananas come here."}
{"text":"My meal was fine and service was friendly.  I enjoyed the cheese puffs and the selection at the salad bar.  I got a little bored with the meat as it seemed like the same 3 varieties kept circling around and I finally asked for the list of options so I could request the ones that hadn't stopped by.  They were all fine, nothing bad, nothing I would be in a hurry to try again. Our server brought us a complimentary dessert for no particular reason, which was a nice surprise.  I felt the cost of the meal was quite reasonable."}
{"text":"We had our small company Christmas dinner here tonight and it was delicious!! I like how the servers are so helpful with direction and the salad bar if available right away. The quality of the meat was excellent. The bar had a great selection of wine and spirits , as well as an nice intimate atmosphere. Bring your appetite and pace your self!!!"}
{"text":"A fantastic dining experience, fabulous atmosphere, family oriented, or could be a romantic dining experience for 2... Food absolutely delicious ... variety, prepared to your liking, quality and quantity under one roof.  The staff was over the top in the area of customer service, they seem to be enjoying their job equally as much as I was enjoying the Dining Experience!!!                                                                                                                                   T.C."}
{"text":"I was going to sit here and write a detailed review touching on a little of everything, but to sum it up...it's amazing and you're missing out if you haven't ever been.   Service is seriously unmatched..everyone in the building has a job and they are on it! You will wait on nothing, but meat to be sliced off on your plate. Before you can finish one slice another is surely on it's way....  If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse expect it to be busy and I assure you, you will return. It's an experience good for any occasion.  I appreciate that I can come in my t-shirt and jeans and not feel out of place eating an upscale meal. You can dress up if you'd like but you don't HAVE to and I appreciate that!   It's great for parties, families and business... I loveeee this place...but be advised your gonna spend some $$ here. Don't worry it's worth every penny..come hungry..verrry hungry!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but don't expect to get friendly service.  The staff was relatively unfriendly from the manager down. We'll try another Brazilian restaurant next time..."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved it here. Everything was delicious from the salad bar to all the meats available. It's definitely one of our new favorite places to return to when we are visiting."}
{"text":"World-class restaurant, servers are excellent.  Although the salad bar is incredible, stay away from it so you can eat more meats, which is their specialty.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is totally the best Brazilian Steakhouse in Las Vegas!!!  Actually my favorite in the whole world but I have only been to Texas De Brazil, the one inside Planet Hollywood and Rodizio Grill in Utah.  I suppose I do not have very many to compare it to but I can still compare.  It is located right off Flamingo so it is accessible.  Ricky is their group sales manager and she is most helpful."}
{"text":"Subpar experience: Two things were clear during a visit to this restaurant for dinner on March 11th (1) if you don't make a reservation you're met with a very lousy/snotty hostess attitude (2) after a long wait, you're place in the furthest backroom - very uncomfortable seating arrangements with poor service.    I was in a group of 7 and the table placement was poorly done with constant interruptions from people trying to squeeze through between table chairs, given the very close proximately with other tables.  Our main server's attitude was decent but slow at best.  Actual meat service was almost none existent, in fact when the meat service would enter this backroom area, they didn't have enough left on the skewers to even make it to our table (except for less popular items like pork sausage).  Only once, did the crown jewel \"filet\" make it to our table - with very little left to just serve a couple of us and a broken promise of returning with more.  It was clear, this section of the restaurant was treated as an afterthought.  Multiple times we complained about this fact with only slight improvements being seen.   The food itself was good but I'm completely floored with the per person price tag a better customer experience wasn't made a priority."}
{"text":"Was at this restaurant on Saturday 03/22/14 and WAY better than the one in Denver.  Much cleaner and the meat was great.  Definitely will come back and dine here again."}
{"text":"Amerika'da damak tad?m?za hitab eden Brezilya restorantlar?n?n iyi bir örne?i tavsiye edilebilir."}
{"text":"Love,the,market buffet, a little,too much attention at the table and loud restaurant. Staff friendly"}
{"text":"This Scottsdale location of the national chain does not disappoint.  The entire dining experience is very upscale.  The vast array of meats are all very well prepared by their excellently trained staff.  Each of the servers in the restaurant are able to help you, so service is always very fast and top-notch.  Who doesn't love a prix fixe menu of delectable meats?  The salad bar is also outstanding.  They make a mean caipirinha too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredible. From the experience to the food and service that comes with it is indescribably pleasant. I return time and time again because it's always amazing quality and an all around great time! Bring your friends and family for a delightful and filling experience!"}
{"text":"As I sit here savoring all of the delicious meat I am enjoying the classy decor.   I discovered the Brazilian Churrascaria in brazil quite a few years ago.   Fogo de Chao does a fantastic job of grilling the choice cuts.  This reminds me of my original experience there.    The salad bar was very fresh and the biscuits have a wonderful eggy flavor.   All of the wait staff were very attentive and friendly.  This is a great place for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, amazing food. Can't complain. Very accommodating staff. Will definitely come back for more.   Cheese bread and after dinner chocolate mints, can't beat them."}
{"text":"This food is so amazing!!! The service was outstanding! Our server's name was Raj but we were taken care of by the whole staff. My parents and I had the best time! I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I wasn't so impressed with this place. Some of the meats were burnt to the point that they were too tough to eat. Their other meats seemed similar to Texas de Brazil's. The picanha and rib eye, which weren't burnt, were good. However, Texas de Brazil's salad bar had a better selection, such as lobster bisque and warm mushrooms, and was a bit bigger. The service wasn't that great at Fogo. When I asked someone passing by if I could get some salt, he visibly looked pissed off. Also, they were really pressuring us to leave because they were closing down after lunch. They didn't do this at Texas de Brazil, and I was never treated rudely by anyone there. Also,Texas de Brazil is bigger and more beautiful with a better atmosphere. Importantly, Texas de Brazil's bathroom didn't stink like sewage. I don't get why restaurants don't fix that. Gross!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently there is a few places like this in Vegas, but this is the best. The salad and side dishes buffet is complete and delicious. The meat is great. Service is awesome. The price is high though like most things in Vegas. I can give you a good tip still to get the best out of this, be social and interact with your servers, talk to them, let them know how you like your meats cooked, they will go above and beyond to satisfy you. Do not act like Zombies as this couple next to us did last week."}
{"text":"Ok. It all started when the person I spoke with said that reservations are not needed up until 8 pm. I said okay. My wife and I are the only ones coming. Granted we have been here 10 plus times. We arrive at 630. The hostess says there's a 45 wait. I explain our previous conversation. With hesitation she agrees to seat us right away. So my wife and I are seated in the far back corner where no one can really see us and meet our dining needs. When it's time for the meats to go around we were not offered some of the meats that are on the menu. So we make a request to our server Gilbert, who by the way was okay., We continued to wait for upwards of 20 minutes to get the pincane cut. I mentioned it to three different waiters. Then after it was all said and done the cut that was brought out was dry. Remember we have been here ten plus times.  Then came the check. I had to ask to pay. Then the server took my card and disappeared for about 20 more minutes. I was close to coming up to the hostess booth to get my card.  Every new years eve we bring about 20 people with us. If you don't want my business or my money please say so. Tonight's meal wasn't worth the $114.00 I spent. The service was terrible ..food good..service not so much. Please contact me with a solution as soon as possible. Thank you."}
{"text":"Dinner was wonderful! Our server Junior was the BEST! We will definitely come back here...the food, atmosphere, customer service and the staff were all on point."}
{"text":"Every time we come here for celebration or birthday or graduation, their food is excellent. They never fail to accommodate your needs. Their steaks is perfectly specially their leg of lamb. The dessert is also good. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"All the reviews are spot on. The food spread was great and worth every penny. The cheese bread was out this world and is not your typical bar appetizer. It was something authentic to Brazil. Don't go to Pampas even with 50% off. Pay more and go away happy."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! We came in today with a large group. The service was top notch and the quality of the food was worth every penny. We really enjoyed ourselves and had an overall excellent experience. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Kicks ass!! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Lamb never tasted so good. Filet was outstanding."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite fogo locations the staff is very friendly all the meats are great especially the ribs."}
{"text":"The food, wine, and service were all great. Brazilian steakhouses are always a good choice with large groups.    The highlight of the night for me, however, was my foreign friend who kept insisting that the murals of gauchos weren't depicting Brazil, but rather Mexico. Apparently the \"Brazilian steakhouse\" part of the name wasn't enough of a clue."}
{"text":"Great Brazillian steakhouse. Great drinks, service and salad bar is awesome. All the meats were tasty seasoned and tender. They offer lamb w mint jelly which I love and the cheese bread, mash potatoes and I think polenta fries and plantains were super yummy. Great meal we will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a Brazilian place. I was amazed with how many people were about providing various meats. The meats were very high quality, spiced really well and kept my eyes open waiting for more food. We went as a part of Phoenix Restaurant week and they were nice enough to pack our complementary dessert to go, because the meat was just too much.   Service was good, not the most fantastic in the world but I never had to wait for more food.   I only wish the lamb had come out more often. But I wish I had room for the second time their signature prime filet came out. That was the bomb dot com.  The Mango Refresco drink was amazing, but not quite $16 good.   Definitely make a reservation if you're there on a Friday, cause its Scottsdale packed. You will see a lot of rich white old guys taking out these fake-boobs twenty-somethings too. Which is hilarious."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Ambiance was nice but relaxed. The manager, Norma was courteous, fun and articulate. She was a pleasure to engage with and is always great to meet a fellow Californian!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Delicious.  Great value for lunch.  The Summerlin location lives up to the standard.  I've been to a Fogo in downtown Chicago and the quality here is exactly the same.   Flavorful and accurately cooked meats, the steak pairs perfectly with the chimichurri sauce.  Great selection of side dishes, my favorite was the peppered and caramelized bacon.  Oh and the weird cheese puffs are so addictive!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the downtown dining scene!  We attended a networking event hosted by the Pittsburgh Business Exchange last night. (Thanks Nathan)  The restaurant owners, Larry and his wife gave us a tour of the kitchen and showed how the meat is aged and prepared. They passed samples around during the event and each one was delicious.   We are looking forward to having dinner there soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome - the service is always great, the food delicious, and the prices are very reasonable for upscale dining. I'm impressed every time I go and I always leave full. Favorite restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"It's our third time being at a Brazilian Steakhouse but I got to say that this place was amazing. The food was amazing amazingly so but the service was phenomenal. 10/10 will be back thank you Minh and Caroline our servers for a great date night!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly, very attentive food was good and overall was a very fun cultural experience! I recommend trying the papaya dessert and Brazilian sodas they are unique and pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Horrible food at this location. The drinks were horrible.  I've been to other locations around the world but this one was the worst."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Fogo and my expectations were met AND exceeded. Food was fantastic and service was on point. Thanks to the manager, Norma for helping make my first visit memorable. We encountered one hiccup with our meal, and she quickly made sure everything was fixed. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an exceptional culinary adventure! The service was impeccable and the selection of meats was incredibly delightful. However, we were even more impressed by the skilled service provided by the bartender Tony and the very attentive service of the server Lucas. They made our night! It was an unforgettable expierience and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Having my party here of over 100 ppl. My mother and I came in to eat dinner to get a feel! Well what must I say? I absolutely loved it. I have on every state in America, all through Europe, Mexico, PR, Saint Thomas and Peru! I've traveled and I loved it! I'm so excited for my party! This is the most perfect place! :) The meats were all so delicious and tender! The buffet was tasteful! And I felt great the whole time!"}
{"text":"Ate here about 2 weeks ago and the service and food was awesome! It was a group luncheon. Cameron was great! The manager also ca me and greeted us to make sure everything was good for us! They really treated us very well. Will come back very soon for another delightful experience."}
{"text":"Attended dinner meeting in a private room. Beautifully renovated interior. Excellent ambiance, service and attention to detail. Quality salad bar selections and savory skewered steak. Great for personal and business, but go there hungry."}
{"text":"Bring an appetite.   High end dining. Quite expensive but you won't find many places like this.   Love Love Love  Grilled meat  Grilled pineapple  More grilled meat  Delicious."}
{"text":"Thanks for the four pounds my fat ass gained last night!  BUT I WOULD DO IT AGAIN. WE LOVE THIS PLACE. Service outstanding. Food great. And the creme brûlée f'ing fantastic!"}
{"text":"For the 40$ a head you pay for all the meat and salad you can eat, this is a heaven for a 20 year old guy!! I have been coming to this location for a few years now during birthdays and special occasions with family. One thing I have voiced is how the employees have remained the same throughout the years!  Since working in the reasturant for about 3 years I have witnessed constant overturn at my job, but Fogo has kept the same hard working people hustling and bustling to please the customers needs. This also falls on management! Employees enjoy being there, whenever that happens, food will have more love and quality to it.   All in all I love going to Fogo for the culture I feel I am absorbing by talking with the staff and indulging in the food."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for a late Valentine's Day dinner...we were first timers. I had been on the web site before we left so I knew the prices; I believe it was $47.50 for the meal and $19.50 for the salad bar only. I don't eat meat so I'm glad they had the salad bar option as well. Since it was a Friday night and we didn't want to wait forever to eat I jumped online and made an online reservation through their site. Once we arrived we only waited a few minutes before being seated. Parking took longer than that...it looked like they had complimentary valet but I didn't have any cash for a tip so we wanted to self-park which looked like the majority of customers did. The parking lot is shared with some other busy stores so parking was very competitive. The restaurant has an open feel and was pretty packed. The atmosphere isn't very relaxing though, the whole restaurant shares the one salad bar which was pretty packed all night, there are the meat chefs buzzing through all the tables constantly, and each section seemed to be run by multiple waiters, bus boys, etc... It just had a very busy feel. There is no menu. You sit, you get an explanation of the service, and you immediately start eating. The entire experience took less than an hour.  Drinks: I ordered a diet coke and it came in a mini bar bottle with a glass of ice. He had an iced tea. The sodas are $3.00...per mini bar bottle so if you like to have a few glasses with dinner...you should order an iced tea which is free refills.  The salad bar has 30 different items which included a spring mix, looked like butter lettuce, spinach, sliced tomatoes, fresh balls of mozzarella, roasted peppers, giant asparagus, green beans, croutons, taboule, bread, potato chips (thick sliced potatoes), mushrooms, cheeses, dressings, and more. They also had some deli meats and fish but I don't eat meat so I didn't pay close attention.  Your meal comes with sides...to be completely honest, although they were nice with the meal, the flavors were somewhat bland. The pão de queijo (warm cheese bread) was exactly like a popover...the fluffy baked good you may enjoy for breakfast with butter and jam. They were okay (pretty bland); I only had one. The crispy hot polenta was served in squares. They were definitely crispy and it was tasty...reminded me of hashbrowns both in flavor and texture. The garlic mashed potatoes were also just okay for me. They were creamy in texture...almost to the point they tasted artificial and were topped with cheese. They weren't served hot though so the cheese did not melt at all. The food was all warm. It seemed like they may pre-dish everything since they get so busy. The caramelized bananas were not sweet. To tell you the truth...they were so bland I thought that they were plantains. They look very dry when they were brought to us...no extra sauce or anything. They just looked unappetizing. We both tried a bite...I guess they could be used between dishes as a palette cleanser.  We also asked for rice and black beans. These are only brought out upon request. The rice was very good...a mild but delicious flavor. The black beans were drowning in bean juices but tasted good...until I bite into a piece of meat and had to spit them out! Yes, I made the decision to spit out food into my cloth napkin in a nice restaurant.  I could not swallow it. Since I mentioned at the beginning of the meal that I don't eat meat, I was very surprised that they didn't warn us about the beans but everyone's human so I didn't really care. I just asked for a new napkin.   For meat service, they have a two sided card for each person; red means stop, green means come at me with those meat sticks. My boyfriend picked out which items he wanted to try...he liked the filet mignon the best. It added up quickly though, they're small pieces but with the multiple meats, the sides, and the salad bar we both got full really fast. I can't stress enough that the service was seamless and everyone was so friendly. The bill, after tip was $97 and change. Keep in mind, we did not have any alcoholic drinks and I only had the salad bar. This experience was a different one and I took my boyfriend here for the meat, to compensate for all the vegetarian meals he shares with me, but overall I would say the food was great, but not the most amazing thing I've have ever experienced. Next time, I would prefer a nice steak house with a more relaxing feel...especially since it's not everyday that we spend $100 on dinner for the two of us."}
{"text":"Clean, Fancy and Great food, pork with cheese is melting delicious!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food ad service. All the staff was very friendly. Our  server Luis was awesome."}
{"text":"Top end really nice place.  I thought the service was really excellent.    They had a bunch of big parties while we where there and dropped the ball on getting us our bottle of wine, took them about 20 minutes to bring it out.    But they acknowledged their goof (without us saying anything) and comped our desserts. Thank you for that.  Everyone has rough nights but despite this one mishap they were really awesome.   Even after their goof they were still really awesome!!  The food was excellent on all levels, the meat, the salad bar was all excellent.    I am happy to say i would for sure go back here again!!  Thanks guys for and awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend after work and we were worried about dress code and they said we were fine the way we were and made us immediately comfortable with our workwear. Service started a little offbeat but after a while it was excellent. The meats that were brought around were delicious and I especially liked the pork made by Benjamin the best. We were seated off to the side to where we were able to see each Gaucho prepare his/her meat with seasoning and finishing off in the fire. It was really neat to see. The only thing I would recommend is to come hungry and try a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 1 year marriage anniversary here on 7/12/16 and we couldn't be more pleased. The food was absolutely delicious and the customer service was exceptional. The staff was very attentive and kind. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The salad bar is kind of small. But a restaurant of this type should prioritize service. Half of our party wasn't getting food and we shouldn't have to ask multiple times just to get meat. This turned our lunch into THREE HOURS because the people who were getting food finished way before the others."}
{"text":"It ok. But to be frank and honest they dont know how to make lamb chops thats medium rare. And they ran out of one of there deserts. How can u run out? People pay money to eat here and you dont make sure you have enough? Im just disappointed. I would chose Texas De Brazil over this place. But thank you for the wonderful staff who saw my disappointment and tried to make sure all is ok."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place to eat if you have a few extra bucks laying around. The salad bar is out of this world and the schmorgesborg of delicious meats being shoved in your face is an experience! My one qualm is the meat was a little over salted and obviously the price doesn't leave for an every friday night kind of place. Still it is a must for \"experience dining\""}
{"text":"Alright, I'm going to make this as short and sweet as possible. If you're vegan or vegetarian, yes there's a giant salad bar for you, but don't waste your time and money. If you're a meat eater but mostly fish or chicken because red meat is soooo bad for you. Go jog to your favorite sushi bar and fill up on those cute little morsels.  If you are a true carnivore.  I mean you embrace the fact that we have been blessed with canine teeth for the ripping and shredding of flesh.  If you pass by a farm filled with cows and you don't notice the smell of poop and moreover you are suddenly blazing a trail to Carl's Jr for a $6 burger.  If you look longingly at your local butcher's apron and think about sucking that fabric clean.  Well my friends, Fogo de Chao is for you.               Now the place if very nicely adorned.  Staff very professional.  Prices are pretty high.  But at the heart of it beats a BBQ joint.  Here's the deal:  The salad bar is awesome.  All of the various extras they bring by your table, delicious.  Having said that, only a fool partakes in those features of this restaurant.  This is all you can eat meat, off a skewer, and when the gauchos come by carving off every type of meat imaginable, you better not have filled up on fluff!  You can get all that other stuff at a million restaurants.  But you cannot get meat like this anywhere else.              The meat is so simply prepared, just heat and salt used as ingredients.  But don't let that fool you into thinking it's boring.  While I admit, I am a sauce man.  Love all kinds and love it all over my BBQ, no matter what kind of meat.  This meat is of superior quality, and so there is very little needed to be done to it to make it taste fantastic.  Look, I can go on and on about the tasty virtues of their perfectly cooked meats.  All you need to know is say yes to every hunk of protein brought by on a sword until you are ready to burst.  Then force down the Creme Brulee, it really is pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"A place Togo go to once just to try out.  Must be a red meat eater, I'm not but the salad bar was outstanding."}
{"text":"yes, carnivores galore. sometimes compromising the lives of tasty animals is necessary.  here i consumed and exceeded my recommended caloric intake, and felt robust thanks be to incredible meat feast. fried, crispy polenta paired well with the succulent meats carved to your liking-- how do you like yours? in my case, medium rare please, or perhaps something that is still pumping blood onto the plate, delightful! fat marbling where it should be, juices trickling out of meat fibers, and the most enjoyable sensation of meat disintegrating in your mouth. YEAH, pretty great. everything receives a thumbs up, with the minor exception of birthday cake surprise dessert, which was...forgettable.   anyway... iron deficiency? no more! i was quite the satiated and proud meat-eater, despite that afterwards the animals took the rest of the week to become completely digested and absorbed."}
{"text":"Had a really great experience here. From the food to the service to the overall atmosphere. The market bar had a great selection and the choices of meat and the quality was outstanding. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Was able to try this restaurant and I can definitely say it is my favorite of all of the Brazilian steakhouses in Pittsburgh.  The staff was very accommodating when making a reservation and modifying the reservation to include more people.  And accommodating in providing bananas, uncooked for the babies at our table.  We were seated right away right in front of the window where all of the meat is cooking, so it was very entertaining.  The cold bar was quite large and had a very good variety of items on it that were all very tasty.  I had the strawberry hibiscus drink and it was delicious. I also ordered a Coke after that was finish and was pleasantly surprised that they had fountain drinks and I wasn't paying $5 for a 1cup glass bottle of Coke like some of the other restaurants serve.  The meats were all delicious, cooked perfectly, and not overly salty.  The only disappointing part was since we were right in front of the window we saw several meats that never made it by our table to try, despite being there over 2 hours.  I finally asked a server to send the parmesan pork my way so I could try it before I left.  The only area that was a bit lacking, and I will chalk up to being the opening week, was our server.  Several members of our party have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, but I had to prompt him to explain everything in detail even after he asked if this was our first time.  And overall he was just very slow.  It took a long time to get drinks, desserts, bills, etc."}
{"text":"This is a great place for someone who is seeking super good meet in a city full of all you can eat buffet... The beef and lamb are superb, but the most amazing thing is the servers. Professional and welcoming! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"What great service!  Took my wife and 8 guest to The Scottsdale location for her 50th birthday and everyone was attentive and courteous. I am looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! Not only is the staff helpful and attentive, but the food is amazing.  Upon entering, you are greeted with a salad and meat and cheese bar with a plethora of choices. You are also given a basket of cheese bread which is delicious. They are tiny rounds of bread mixed with cheese, giving it a dense, spongy texture with a crisp outer shell.   You are also given some side dishes to accompany the meats you will be given. You are given mashed potatoes (which was mediocre), but the sweetened plantains and fried polenta were delicious.  Now for the main event. My absolute favorite was the prime rib and filet mignon. I thought it was incredible that they could slice you a medium rare all the way to a medium well piece of meat from the same piece! I always opted for medium, and they were always a perfect cut. The meat was juicy and tender and flavorful. We also tried the short ribs and chicken, which also had tender meat. The pork tenderloin with parmesan was juicy and cut like butter. Now this is the section where I gave this restaurant a four instead of a five rating; some of the meats were salty. From the meats I had, the pork was the saltiest. And on only parts of the filet mignon (not the entire thing, odd enough), was salty. This made me not want to finish the meat because the saltiness was overpowering.  To end the wonderful meal, we had a slice of the Tres Leches cake, and wow. The cake was extremely moist and was sweet, but not too sweet.   Definitely an experience everyone should try. Amazing place!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for dinner Friday night through open table at 8pm. Arrived at restaurant and it was very busy. I advised that we had a reservation at 8pm and they told me they were seating 7 thirties so it would be a bit of a wait. We only waited 15 minutes then were seated. Restaurant was nice and elegant. Many people were dressed up in fine attire and some in shorts and sandals. The salad bar was impressive as it had many delicious choices. The bar with the side orders was empty almost the entire time. I only tasted a few of the roasted potatoes and the white rice. No beans, no scalloped potatoes ect. A little dissapointed in this. The meats however were outstanding quality. I really like the fact that they ask you how you want your meat and give you your desired cut. Every meat I tasted was juicy , flavorful and just plain amazing.  The only meat I did not like was the Linguica. The price was pricey at $50 per person but well worth the service and quality of food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We somewhat enjoyed our experience here. One thing that we were confused about was that I ordered the full churrasco, and my husband just ordered the market table because he doesn't eat much red meat. One of the servers looked at us with such disgust when we ordered that and he realized we weren't both getting the full. Isn't it our right to choose what we want on the menu? He allowed seemed like he was going to ask us to leave or force us to order something we didn't want.  Everyone else was super kind and did a great job. We were just really taken aback by the one server.  Food was ok. I really only liked the prime sirloin, I would probably just get that next time. My husband enjoyed the market table and said there was a good selection. I actually would rather save my money and eat at a local restaurant instead for better food."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place ,but the food sucked ..everything tasted the same , super salty .the steak tasted burnt and fatty and the filet mignon had a huge fat vain running threw it ...even the salad tasted dirty ..the lamb tasted like dirty socks ..the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because they had good service ..it was a Friday night and they were dead ..should have gone to Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"Outstanding in food and service. The managers were fantastic and courteous. Favorite was the house rib steak."}
{"text":"Mest meat and more meat, oh and the salad bar is bomb!  Yelped while in Vegas and found this walking distance from our hotel.    I liked it because of the meat-of course.  Lamb, chicken and BEEF!  Lots if it, rib eye, new york, filet perfect.  Well cooked and the servers were plentiful.  I didn't have to wait long to get replenished.  The surprise was the salad bar.  My wife and daughter are still raving about it.  I liked it, for fillers.  Good selection of fruit and veggies.  Soups were good and everything was fresh.  As far as buffets go, there are bigger selections on the strip.  But this is not crowded, not huge and priced reasonably-for a buffet.  I will be back here when I return.  In fact, even the wife and daughter said they would return here!  For an AYCE meat buffet, that is unusual---oh yea, it has a salad bar"}
{"text":"You know a Brazilian steakhouse isn't good when the salad bar is the best part of your meal... I waited for lamb chops and they tasted old, as did most meats. Garlic sirloin was fatty, bacon sirloin tasted awful. Beans were so peppery that I couldn't finish eating them. Server was weird, and the passadores acted like we were bothering them. Definitely not worth the $$."}
{"text":"1st time ever at this restaurant.  The meats were cooked nicely and seasoned right.  Many BBQ/Steakhouses can easily under/over cook their meats and usually their under-seasoned.  My only gripe would be that their selection should include brisket and a pork tenderloin that is not crusted in cheese."}
{"text":"Best food and service I've ever experienced.  The sides were amazing, and the meats.  WOW.  I had chicken, ribeye, sirloin, and filet mignon.  All were cooked to perfection and full of flavor.  The filet mignon felt like heaven for my mouth.  My husband got all of above and pork ribs, which were so tender it literally fell off the bone. The wait staff was superb.  Never an empty glass, not even half empty.  Also should a meat server come and he didn't have what you wanted, simply mentioned what you wanted and within minutes they are back with your request.  The price is high but in my opinion, well worth it for the amount and Quality of the food. I was so pleased I even left one of the biggest tips I've ever given for a two person meal.  I will continue to visit when we come yearly for conferences.  And I will highly recommend to everyone I meet."}
{"text":"I got a coupon for $25 off lunch or dinner for my birthday month through the email promos, so I got some friends together to grab lunch! FYI lunch is $30 per person whereas dinner is $50 while having the same food!  We got seated quickly , and our server Derek was very friendly and we ordered our waters and the sauces (chimichurri, horse radish, and mint jelly) for our meats later. Before I got started with meats I had to get my favorites from the salad bar: pickles peppadew peppers, orange kale salad, smoked salmon, potato salad, and butter lettuce! The meat taste better with these sides, I can no longer only eat meat.  My favorite meats are the beef rib, ribeye, Parmesan pork, and bacon wrapped filet mignon. I tried some meats that was sub par.. Pineapple pork chop had no pineapple taste or scent, but it was tender. The bottom sirloin I had was super charred, and half was uneatable. Lastly, the garlic sirloin I got was completely burnt, but the gaucho was in such a hurry, I couldn't ask for a properly cooked one.  Despite the food quality complaints this time I still enjoyed it. Our server Derek was the bomb; he heard it was my birthday and got me a free desert!  Overall this place is well worth it for lunch price, just make sure that food coma doesn't get you afterwards!"}
{"text":"For the price and reputation, Scottsdale location can do a little better, service-wise"}
{"text":"First time here. This place was awesome. The food was amazing!  A little pricey, but it was worth it. The staff was very friendly and attentive. They explained how everything worked. They constantly brought more meat and our drinks were never empty. This place was classy and the owner checked on us twice to make sure everything was fine. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to eat meat for special occasions! Probably not so much if you're vegetarian/vegan   Had the shrimp cocktail at the beginning of the meal that was offered - was it worth it? Eh. I'd probably save the room for the meats.  Tried several kinds of meats and I think my favorites were the garlic sirloin and the chicken leg.   Unfortunately, the 'flip the card to have meat served' system wasn't quite working here, at least for my table. Perhaps it was the location in which we were seated, but it seemed we were non-existent to the servers. The same servers would come by offering the same meats, but it took a bit of time to flag down the others we haven't tried. When we did get to try some cuts, they were sometimes no longer warm, understandably since the servers were walking around with them for a while.   If this is your first visit here and haven't ever tried the cheese puff bread, my tip for you is DON'T. These addicting little bastards had me reaching for them one after another. I prepared myself all day, having a small lunch and going for a long run to fill myself with all the meats. Unless you know you're going to be able to restrain yourself to a minimal amount of these puffs, just say no to these magical cheesy balls of puff.   On a more serious note, the service at this particular location was quite disappointing. We were often overlooked and it was an effort to have meats served, even to have a glass of water refilled."}
{"text":"I usually go to Texas de Brazil but I thought I would give Fogo de Chao a try.  My husband ordered an ice tea and it tasted terrible, very bitter.  He asked if he could exchange it for a diet coke and waiter came back and told us that he would have the charge him for both the ice tea (that had one sip missing) and the diet coke.  In my opinion, that's just poor customer service.  In the end the meal was okay.  The salad bar was okay but not too impressive.  In my opinion, I would rather go to Texas de Brazil.  The atmosphere, food, and service are better."}
{"text":"This is exactly what a meathead like me wants for dinner! Meat, meat and more meat! When you're in Las Vegas with a large group this would be perfect, they have a high end atmosphere with large tables for groups of friends and family. They are a high-end Brazilian steak house,  that serves all you can eat, delivered to your table by simply turning over a red or green card to indicate to the watchful eye of the servers, that you want more meat delivered! They will come running! I've been to the Houston Texas location also,  and they're consistently awesome time and time again. They offer the largest selection of steaks such as brisket, top sirloin, tenderloin and filet mignon all included along with lamb, chicken and pork. All the meats are slow cooked and smoked Brazilian style. So for a night out for 56 bucks a person for all you can handle steaks in Vegas in a vibrant atmosphere, located right off the strip on Flamingo, its worth the value."}
{"text":"I love this place...it comes close to Texas de Brazil; the only thing I do not like is the parking situation.  Everything else was great!  I love the fact that they give you sides and they keep replenishing it!  The price was decent but we went during restaurant week so I am not sure what the real price is.  But this is some place I would like to go back again!  The lamb was ok but the sirloin was everyone's favorite!  The coffee was good and desserts were all yummy.  Because there was a group of us we got to try almost everything.  We had the Papaya ice crea, flan, creme burlee, chocolate molten and cheesecake with strawberries,  Everything was really good and not too sweet!  The papaya ice cream was very settle and not too sweet but you would have to let it \"marinate\" in your mouth to recogonize the flavors.  I would suggest that they do not put too much raspberry sauce.  The cheesecake was very rich but not in a bad way, the texture is smooth and melts away in your mouth.  The chocolate molton was just enough chocolate without overwhelming your taste buds and both the flan and creme burlee was perfect!  The texture and the righ amount of sweetness!  Again I would visit the place again!  The servers were all very tentative and was great in pre-bussing the tables and getting all the clutter off the table as quickly and often as possible!  And our cups were never empty!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE the food here and have been in multiple times but I have to say,  last night was extremely disappointing from the moment we walked in until we left.  I had my newborn with me and requested a sling.  The gentlemen set it down and watched me put the baby into it securely then mentions that it might not be a good place to have the baby in because it would be in the way of the employees slicing the meat. So then why would you put it there to begin with and then wait until after I put the baby in it to mention that??!!  Second, a waiter comes up to the table numerous times while we were waiting for our guests being very aggressive and trying to up sell us things we were not interested in. We were there for the delicious Brazilian meats not seabass.  He was very rude and arrogant in the process. We had to ask multiple times for items that were missed or never brought out at all.  However,  given that it is a team effort where you get multiple servers that come up to the table I can see how things might be  miscommunicated. That leaves me to the final and the most disappointing part of the evening.   My father in law drove up last year  from out of town for his birthday and liked it so much he drove into town again requesting to come back to this restaurant again for his birthday. Last year I spoke to our server as well as a manager explaining that we would like to surprise him with a molten chocolate cake for his birthday. It never came out.  They offered him the desert menu,  he chose the molten chocolate cake,  they brought it out with no candle or birthday at all.  I approached the manager asking what happened.  They apologized,  came up to the table and told him they were going to surprise him with a desert.  Ummmm, when you tell someone about the surprise is not really a surprise plus we already had the one that was supposed to be a birtday. So they basically ruined the entire moment.   Last night I arrived early having a conversation with THREE people including another manager explaining what happened last year and basically begged for it to not happen this time.  Unfortunately that was too much to ask because for the second year in a row the same thing happened!!!!   The best part was apparently they were closing,  the servers were circling our table like sharks impatiently waiting for us to leave.  Meanwhile, I was still waiting for them to surprise the guest of honor with the deserts we preselected and spoke about. Our main server said no one mentioned it to him but after speaking to 3 different people I can't understand how this happened,  AGAIN!!"}

{"text":"What wonderful experience, and not just the food which was exceptional. From the time we were seated at our table to the time we left the restaurant....FANTASTIC ! Can't wait to go back...Fogo de chao helped make this one of the most memorable Father's Day. Thank you."}
{"text":"Went here for anniversary dinner and really had fun. The only thing, which I won't fault them for, was that the private room available was rented out. Because of the location, I imagine it was a large group in town for a conference, but they took up the whole space and it had to be near 100 people. It wasn't an issue, except that we were starting our meal around the same time as that large group so the line for the salad bar wrapped around a full 1.25 times. :) **  I would have stayed in my seat and just drank/ate the little fluffy-bread-yummy-like-crack balls but I didn't know when the line would get better and I was hungry.   We tried many different meats and the meat servers (?) are very diligent when it comes to paying attention to the red/green that says that you're open to more meat or not. (This is probably one of my favorite sentences I've ever written on Yelp, btw.)  It was an excellent experience and very much unlike the Brazilian steakhouse experience in the movie Bridesmaids, in every way possible. The sweet bananas they give you - KILL ME, THEY'RE DELICIOUS.  **Fogo management, if you're listening, maybe warn people that a large party will be there at the same time, if someone is making a reservation? I'd believe that there is no way around the long line, but it's just nice to know ahead of time, IMO. (Preparing for a pre-dinner cocktail  or something...)"}
{"text":"The 13 caipirinhas drink menu is one of a kind. Made with real fruit (unlike some competitors who use fruit concentrate) and flair. The food is typical brazilian with over 15 types of meats. The salad bar is fair at best but when the meat is all-you-can-eat who cares? The staff is very friendly and always stops by with a good story or joke. I love going here for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the atmosphere is fancy and it's a lot of  fun to go to!  HOWEVER the service here sucks! We only saw our waiter twice, the first when he took our drink order and the last when he dropped off the check... he never checked up on us, and every time we needed something we had to stop another server which was annoying.  Anyways, yes it's delicious but I probably won't come back for a while. $50/person (not including drinks and tax) plus dessert (we got a creme brulet, IT WAS SO GOOD) is way too much especially when you have to tip a server who gave you no service."}
{"text":"All you can eat steak? Ummm...yes, sign me up! I love the concept. Green side up means keep on bringing me that beefy goodness. Red side up means ok stop, the meat coma has commenced.  The restaurant is intimate, upscale and romantic. Its like a fancy buffet with several gauchos walking around with an array of different meats on a stick, there to satisfy all your carnivorous desires. Well worth the $52 dollars a person.  Tip-  have to try the Brazilian cheese bread balls, they are addicting!"}
{"text":"Great place to go to try different cuts of meat that have been seasoned Brazilian style. The experience of sitting down to start with drinks and the buffet is a nice way to dine, but feels more like an attempt to up-sell very marked-up wine. Some buffet items are good like the apple salad, basil sauce, or the smoked salmon, but the best thing from my experience is learning that I love filet minon for the tenderness. However, I realized then that although it is tender, it is not very flavorful and it explains why they use a lot of seasoning and then wrap it in bacon. So, I would say go here if you are a meat lover and want to try different meats. Otherwise, spend the $50 on a nice cut at the butcher to cook at home."}
{"text":"Amazing as always. I have never been disappointed. I have been to Fogo in Beverly Hills only. But then tried this for the first time today for lunch.  When we noticed lunch was only $30 we jumped on it! We were wondering if there would be less of a meat selection due to it being lunch-but nope! The same great meats and excellent service. I love this place. If you want some delicious tasting meats and love the all you can eat experience-YOU MUST COME HERE! You will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! I PROMISE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The Filet Mignon, Bottom Sirloin, and the house sirloin is to die for!! Salad bar is great too! We hit a Fogo anytime there is one where we are vacationing. We've eaten at San Antonio, Addison, Austin, and Scottsdale.  The reason for the 2 Stars is because of the service. Scottsdale's location leaves A LOT to be desired! They have no idea how to refill drinks or even the bread basket. They also do not know the difference between medium, medium well, and well done. We were really disappointed :-("}
{"text":"Went to Fogo really excited to eat and get the Brazilian experience. Also, it was my first time.. I walked into the rudest hostesses and was very upset with how I was treated as they made me feel dumb and giggled when I said I was confused because I had never been. Other than that my waiter was very helpful and nice. He did charge me wrong and try to get more money from me but fixed it after I told him."}
{"text":"I've been to Fogo De Chao probably 5 or 6 times now, and this experience was probably the worst.  You know what they say...you usually don't write good reviews all the time, but when you experience a bad one, you'll surely write one.  This is the case last night.  The times we do go, its usually on a Friday or Saturday night, but this time we went on a Thursday night.  The food was great as usual, but the service was god awful.  It was extremely slow.  So everyone knows their concept, you drop 60 bucks for all you can eat meat and their salad bar.  They have guy walking around with meats and they stop by your table, well on this night it seemed our table was completely invisible  to them.  So we arrived in a pretty big group, there were about 15 of us.  We arrived at 6:00 PM and started eating at 6:15.  From 6:15 to 6:45 only one \"guacho\" came to our table.  We addressed it with our waiter who was extremely friendly and helpful, but she really couldn't do much.  When she finally did tell them, they would come to our table and offer meat to couple of people, then walk away.  We were to the point where we were trying to flag people down!  The gaucho's with chicken and pork stopped by out table frequently, but I didn't pay 60.00 bucks for chicken, I wanted the red meat!  Overall, extremely disappointing experience for sure.  It got to the point where, I wasn't even full or satisfied, but just gave up on flagging those jokers down and flipped the card to red.  Matay.  I give up.  Maybe it was just a weekend, understaff or whatever, but it was truly a disappointing night and the service was pathetic."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!! I have never been to a restaurant where the staff was as attentive as they were here. Lou, the manager, Dan the customer service manager, and Norma our server were all just amazing. So stopping here would be sufficient right? Maybe but I can't stop..because.....the FOOD. I don't know where to start...the salad bar with all kinds of fresh h'oduerves - giant asparagus, fresh mozarella balls, zuchinni, salads etc...or handsome men walking around with pipping hot beautiful cooked meats (16 to be exact) on gigantic metal prongs sliced so thin so that you can savor the flavor either plain or with a cup of delicious salsa or some kind of cilantro dipping..I couldn't choose...so there you go. Last but not least the dessert. It was my mother's birthday so she ordered the tres leche cake. I've had plenty of tres leche cakes in my life but this particular one at Fogo was the most moist, and succulent that I've ever had the pleasure of eating. If someone were to ask me if I'd ever return I would have to look at them like they were missing some brain cells because my answer will ALWAYS be YAAAASS!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to several Brazilian Steakhouses in several states and this is great for a chain. The prices are reasonable for lunch and kids love it.  We took relatives here for lunch and they were so impressed that when they got home, they drove almost two hours to dine at their closest Fogo.  I do have my favorite Brazilian steakhouse in Chicago, which I consider a 5-star. Fogo is close to my favorite, pretty close! I have been to really bad Braz Steakhouses too, where the meat was dry and old. Fogo was definitely not that, the meat is always juicy and the choices are amazing.  The salad bar is a \"be careful\" zone. It's so good you have to be careful not to fill up before the meat and sides come. Our guest mentioned she would have been happy just with the salad bar, she was so impressed.   Kids really love Brazilian steak houses. They love watching their meat choices being slid off of big swords. Their eyes light up when they see servers walking around with long swords of meat. I'm sure there are a lot of adults who get that same thrill as well.   Fogo de Chao is definitely a carnivore's haven!"}
{"text":"First time to a Brazilian steak house and they did not disappoint.The service was attentive and the food delicious! I plan to return. Its a great place for friends or couples to enjoy."}
{"text":"Meat lovers paradise. Service and food was wonderful.   Salad  bar was plentiful  and the many types of meats were prepared  perfectly.  It's a little pricey so be prepared  to spend some money but it's worth every penny.  Great wine selections."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We made a reservation for 7 and when we arrived we do get seated right away. We were seated near the entrance to the kitchen so we see the meat coming out. Waiter told us there were 66 different types of meat. We were excited to try them! night we tried about 6 different types of meat. We saw other types of meats leave the kitchen but never reached our table.    The side dishes were bland and gross. I gave this place a one star because at least the waiter was nice and helpful. After tax and tip. It was $70, what a waste of money.  And to make matters worse, I got food poisoning from this place. I was stuck in the bathroom all night!  Kevin C from Yelp decided to call me dumb and stupid because he states I heard wrong about the 66 types of meat, there were 7 of us! We all heard the same thing, I didnt believe the waiter and obviously there wasnt. Yes I'm stupid and dumb for eating at this place, another yelp fail & disappointment!"}
{"text":"I love these Brazilian steakhouses. But tonight, I'm sad to say I was a little disappointed. The salad bar was not that great; not as many selections as their other location. The plantains were good, but the potatoes were very cold. The beef ribs were sooooo tender. Cooked very well BUT soooooo salty. They were way over salted. I thought it was just my piece, but others at the table complained of the same thing. The zucchini at the salad bar is usually one of my faves, but today they were way over cooked and were too mushy. The mushrooms are also usually my go-to side with meats but they also weren't that good. We had a reservation at 8:30 so IF I decide to come back again, I would probably avoid scheduling close to end of business hour just incase that's the reason why my experience lacked satisfaction.  I would most likely go back to the other location.   Dessert - creme brule was delish!  Customer service was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Expensive but excellent food. It is worth every penny you spend there. The meat just needs the right amount of salt and pepper and let the meat shine for itself. Having said that, I was also never disappointed with the service either until my very  last visit. Despite reserving a party of 20 several days before-hand, we had to wait for more than 40 minutes for our table. Personally in this situation I usually cancel my reservation and go to another restaurant, but when you have 20 people with you, it is difficult to migrate to other places and feel obligated to wait.  I know for sure that next time I come here to not  bring large parties at this place. I gave 3 stars due to poor organization, but will give 5 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Adequate and just what you expect from a Brazilian Steakhouse: meat served and a salad bar.  Our table host was rude, just dropped the wine list and took off for another 20 minutes.  Didn't take a drink order or explain the setup to us.  I had been to other Brazilian steakhouses but this was my first visit to Fogo.  The salad bar quality was good but didn't have enough variety.  The meat servers were extreme friendly and enthusiastic which offset our rude server some.   We came here as our anniversary dinner to celebrate.  Most likely will not be back to this particular one but I can't say any of the food I ate was bad.  Just not worth the money."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recently invited us to join for his birthday dinner at Fogo. My initial thought was \"what am I going to be able to eat here?!\"  but was assured that their salad bar was \"banging\".  So, alas we arrive and the woman and I hit up the bar while we waited for our peeps.  She got a really great dark beer and I tried to go outside of the box and ordered a melon martini.  It was terrible, but I didn't want to send it back cause it was kind of my own fault.  The bartender, however, noticed my full glass and asked if there was something else he could get for me.  Thank you sir!!!  I got a glass of Malbec instead, and it was great.  Our friends arrived, and we were seated.  It was like a whirlwind of craziness after.  Our server twirled on over and explained super fast how the place worked and what it was all about.  He went around asking what we all wanted to drink, and when he got to my lady, he called her sir...annoying.  She clearly is a woman.  Whatev, stuff happens sometimes when you're high on meat fumes.  After he was done with our drink order, we all got up to grab some salad.  Now, I know that this place is a meat house, but if you're gonna charge me 23 bones for my salad bar, please, make it great!  I grabbed some lettuce and started walking around to see what else I wanted.  There were these huge asparagus piled high, so I grabbed a few.  Then I grabbed some green beans, huge beet slices and broccoli, too.  I went to the dressings and was kind of disappointed.  There were ranch, caesar, and what looked and tasted like zesty Italian from Kraft. Boo.  Everything looked really good, but nothing was seasoned at all.  I mean, I appreciate being given the option to season my own items, but plain bland everything?  I want some flavor people!    Once seated, meat on sticks came from every direction.  It's kind of funny to watch.  Two of my dining companions ordered limeades, and no joke, had to ask for refills from multiple people (at least four times!) before someone came by with a pitcher.    The boyfriend of the birthday boy decided to propose that evening, and asked them to please bring the ring out on the dessert plate, and they did so very well.  I'll give them a star for that.  It was cute and sweet, both literally and figuratively.  I just ordered an after dinner coffee for my dessert, and everyone seemed please with their treats.  Ugh, then when it came time to pay, we decided that I would put $100 on my card and the rest was in cash.  When someone FINALLY came by to pick up the bill, I explained this.  He looked very confused. So, I repeated \"Just 100 on the card and the rest cash.\" Simple enough, right?  Not so much.  It literally took about ten minutes for someone else to bring our monies back and when they did, the guy used all the cash and put the remainder of $61 on my card (I'm just glad is wasn't more than what I asked him to put on)...but still, I serve bro! It's not hard to do!  I was completely underwhelmed by my experience here and do not plan on returning.  At least I won't suffer from any meat sweats.  NEXT!"}
{"text":"This has become our favorite place to take the family for dinner. The service is stellar. I can't remember where else we have gone where the servers are so attentive to every little need. The food is delicious! Our favorites are the parmesan crusted pork and the house special sirloin. The salad bar is not your typical one, but we love the options there, especially the pepper crusted bacon. We haven't had one bad experience at this place and always love coming to Downtown Summerlin. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great service and an overall fantastic experience!! I took my wife for her birthday, and it exceeded our expectations. The meats were hot, and seasoned to perfection. The market bar had some great sides. Enjoyed a nice red wine with our meal and left totally satisfied. My personal favorite were the little linguica sausages and the picanha sirloin. I can't not mention the carmelized bananas. I won't lie, they looked kinda weird, but were beyond tastey!!"}
{"text":"Amazing churrascaria! This was my first experience in one, and if all of them are like this, I have been missing out!  I went for a friend's birthday while in Las Vegas and it was our one nice dinner for the trip. Walking in, I was not expecting such nice decor since it was AYCE. It was layed out like a nice steakhouse.   The wait staff gives you a short introduction about how the churrascaria works. There is an open salad bar and you have a coaster for when you want to get the meats. Green means bring on the meat and red lets the staff know that you need a break.   I got a few things from the salad bar, but didn't want to fill up on it. Ingredients were fresh and they even have smoked salmon and bacon. They also give side dishes to share. Fried banana(delicious), polenta, mashed potatoes, and cheese rolls (awesome!) The fun comes next. As you turn your coaster over to the green side, you'll be attacked from all sides by dudes with sharp knives. There are like 15-16 different meats to choose from. After the first three or four, I had to turn my coaster to the red side to let them know I wanted a break. Everything looked super delicious but I knew if I kept getting the meat, it would turn cold. Everything is quaility and cooked superbly. I love my meats rare/medium rare. They were able to accomodate. Meats were seasoned well and I didn't find anything that was tough or chewy.   I found myself eating a lot of meat and bananas and not wasting too much stomach space on salad and potatoes. Also, on the table is a menu of all the meats, if you didn't see something that you like and want to try, you can always ask the staff and they'll bring the right guy to your table. One of those dishes I asked for was the garlic top sirloin. You probably can't go wrong with any of the meats you ask for, but surprisingly, one of the best was the chicken leg. It came out on the skewer with you choice of a pork sausage or chicken leg. After I asked for the chicken, the server said it was an excellent choice. It didn't dissapoint. Very moist, flavorful and good amount of char.   I'm glad my friend chose this for her birthday meal. It was a delightful eating experience."}
{"text":"Every few years we head to Las Vegas for conventions. Each time Fargo de Chao is on the restaurant list of to-do's... Great food, salad bar is excellent, meats also terrific. Their service is great, amazing given the volume of people they serve each night. A great place for groups and couples!!"}
{"text":"Lunch is a good value but you better come hungry... a meat lover's dream and a vegetarian's biggest nightmare... Filet, lamb chops, leg of lamb, sirloin, bacon wrapped chicken, etc etc ... very tasty! Buffet with rice, beans, salad included!"}
{"text":"Having been to Churrasco in Brazil, I already know that I am a fan of Brazilian Steakhouses in general.  But the Fogo de Chao in Scottsdale, is probably the best one I've been to, and here's why -   The cleanliness and decor are top notch.  Not that other Fogo's are not, but this one is the nicest of the ones I've been to.  The service at this one is excellent!  And they really appreciate my few Portuguese phrases!  Muito Obrigado goes a long way here...  Finally, as I have come to expect from Fogo de Chao, the food is excellent.  Of course, if you don't like mouthwatering, perfectly cooked meat right off the skewer, then this place probably isn't for you.  Oh, and if you are somehow able to flip your card over to red when someone keeps coming by to ask if you want another piece of filet mignon or picanha, their dessert is excellent as well.  Enjoy..."}
{"text":"Took my hubby this weekend for his B-day...he LOVED it! Def have great service and TONS of food so come hungry! We had a light breakfast and didn't eat for the rest of the day in preperation. I like that even though they bring it around for everyone I was still able to get my steak Medium, rare. THe filet and the p-something (half moon shaped) are by far the best. The salad bar was very interesting with everything from fresh mozzerealla to asparagus. My husband could barely breath due to overeating but def worth while for a special occasion and like I said the servce was amazing"}
{"text":"Yum! As a Texas de Brazil favorite, I was nervous about coming here, but I wasn't disappointed!  We came here with my husband's family to celebrate a late Christmas.  We are all huge meat lovers, so this is right up our alley.    The concept is simple.  You get a card that is red on one side and green on the other.  The waitstaff walks around with different cuts of meat.  They have sausage, chicken, lamb, flank steak, filet, ribs, pork, and more!  When your card is green, they will offer it to you.  Red means they won't come to you.  In my case, red and green both screamed, \"Stay away!\"  We actually had to request meats from our server, as it felt as if our table was being avoided at some point.  Once that was taken care of, everything else was great.  They even offered to make the meat well done for my husband's grandma.  They serve this cheese puff pastry thing as an appetizer.  Omg.  As a bread and cheese lover, all I can say is yuuuum!! But that's how they get you filled up. So be careful - they're addicting!!  The server will also bring mashed potatoes and fried bananas and plantains.  So yummy!  Then there is a self-service area where you can get an assortment of sides from: soups, salads, cheese, salami, rice (way too salty), green beans, fruit, etc.    We had the chocolate molten lava cake for dessert, which was also yummy!  Although dinner is pricey, it's all around a great treat.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The food is wonderful. The customer service and attention is fabulous. They pamper you. They talk to you. They are fast to serve you. Just a wonderful place to go. I wouldn't have celebrated my birthday anywhere else. Looking forward to more memories here in the future."}
{"text":"we've received the WORST SERVICE ever!!! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! nobody checked on us not even once, we came here to celebrate our 5th year anniversary and guess what we chose the wrong place, texas de brazil was fully booked therefore we ended up coming to this lousy place. not even worth 1 star! Even the server is sooo cocky! We will never come back to this lousy place again."}
{"text":"man I had to drop them a star because who ever took the reservation was so rude and short on the phone it was a women I think it was the same women that was there when my party bit to the restaurant she had just a nasty attitude then too all the servers were nice and the food was grate but it that was my 1st time call I would if never went I'll be back hopefully I won't vet her again"}
{"text":"Something about this place just doesn't have me excited to go back. The salad bar is what I would expect at that price point - but nothing too over the top.   Obviously most people come for the meat...yes the variety is awesome, but the meat is great to so-so to poor. We had an abundance of their least quality steak coming around as well as bacon wrapped dry chicken! In over an hour we only saw many of the meats once. I asked politely three times for the ribs, and after 20 minutes of waiting I gave up. I felt scammed - the pork loin was incredibly dry and a lot of the steak reminded me of zoo animal smells. How many times do we have to say NO to the sausage? I realize it's their cheap filler, but c'mon...  The highlight of the night was the filet, ribs (beef), chicken, the bread, polenta, and the mozzarella.   It was nice leaving full, but I'd rather grill at home next time!"}
{"text":"I brought a group of about 25 here and was nervous about getting us all seated and served in time because of a show we were attending after dinner. The staff at this Fogo location whisked away all my fears with their attentiveness and professionalism though, and we left with memories of a great meal.  Because of the size of my group, I reserved the private dining room, which I highly recommend for its convenience and privacy. It was ready when we arrived, and we had two waiters who stayed with our group the whole evening to attend to us (in addition to the gauchos serving our meats). Once the wine was flowing, we were generating quite a bit of noise, but the walls of the private room contained it well (or so the waiter assured me; I'll take his word for it). We did a round of speeches towards the end of the meal, and without being asked, our wait staff promptly closed the sliding doors dividing the private room from the main floor to let us have our moments. Oh, the food was good too.  Good for groups? Absofruitly."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great everything!  This place beats out the big names on the strip by far...   Bring your taste buds and appetite!"}
{"text":"WOW wow WOW! Had a friend in town, so \"the girls\" got together to dine at Fogo's. Excellent choice. This is one of those place that if you're going there for dinner, don't eat lunch! We started off with drinks. Went lightly on the fabulous salad bar, which is not easy to do as everything looks SO good. Love the little cheesy muffins they bring to the table. Then here comes the meats... I'm not going to ding them a star, but just FYI... the chunk of sirloin they were carving from was tough, and the chicken, a little dry. But everything else was YUMmeee! We even saved room for dessert. The molten chocolate cake was excellent. Not real sweet - I couldn't stop chipping away at it although I was sure I was going to explode. One chum had the Tres Leche cake and said it was the best she's had. Another had the key lime. I'm sure she would have said something, but she was too busy devouring it.  It's a LOT of food, but it's good food. As for the service, also excellent. There was always someone coming by to clear, or serve, or refill. Nicely done Fogo's, nicely done!"}
{"text":"This is going to be a long story.  So I went to my 1st Brazilian churrascaria at the Fogo de Chao in Chicago back in 2009.  It was awesome.  Probably one of the greatest eating experiences I have ever had.  Since then I've ventured to many other churrascarias (read my Texas de Brazil review) and always compared them to my 1st time.  Well, what a delight when I was visiting Vegas and saw that a Fogo de Chao finally opened up a location here.  So I invited my friend Angela to eat here.  And she's never been to a churrascaria so I was pretty excited.  I book a reservations online for opening dinner time, 1700.  Was really easy and no issues with booking.  We actually got there early and sat at the bar.  We took a look at their special menu of caipirinhas and asked the bartender what his recommendations were.  He was pretty awesome because he actually told us not to order certain drinks because he thought they didn't mix well and recommended their premium caipirinha.  We decided to order one of these and the melon flavored one.  They both weren't bad but honestly I didn't think they were amazing.  If you've never had one, give it a shot.  Myself, I think I'll pass on it for the future.  We didn't sit long before they told us our table was ready.  We sat down and the 1st thing I noticed was how dimly lit the lights were.  Almost like a strip club, it was a little strange.  I like to clearly see the food I'm eating.  Well, the meat ensemble started in.  16 different meats served tonight.  Admittedly some of the meats is really salty and left me thirsting for water pretty bad afterwards but still pretty outstanding overall.  Some of the meats definitely better than others.    You also get served three sides on the table.  Garlic mashed potatoes, fried banana, and fried yucca I think.  They're pretty outstanding.  The yucca is super crunchy, the potatoes garlicky and the banana really sweet.  The only problem with the sides is that you're so focused on eating the meats, the sides tend to get cold and definitely just don't taste as good.  So this is really the start of the beginning for me.  I think I've finally hit the wall.  I'm 39 years old now and my body's really starting to fight me back.  What do I mean?  I ate a ton of food that night and a massive amount of meat.  I thought I was going to die from meat poisoning.  That meat really stuck hard in my mid-section (stomach?) and was crazy heavy the rest of the night.  I honestly just don't think I can do this anymore.  Just done with eating soooooooooooooo much meat.  Yep, I've over the hill.  Sigh.  So, what's the solution?  Why even mention all this?  Because if you're not a carnivore and get invited to come eat here, you can order just the salad bar for $20.  It's a great deal.  If I lived/worked close by, I would probably do this at least 1/month.  Maybe even for lunch.  The salad bar is awesome.  Something like 30+ selections on the bar.  Bar is like 20 feet long and different selections on both sides.  Really outstanding selections of food and all really good.  There was even a plate of just fried bacon!  Was salad topping.  Kinda crazy, I almost wanted to grab the entire plate it looked so good.  Finally for dessert we ordere the papaya cream and the flan.  The flan was outstanding.  Flan is usually too dense or too drippy and really hard to balance the two to make the perfect flan.  This was it.  Really just perfect.  Amazing.  The papaya cream?  Wow, it's almost like eating ice cream except it's not.  It's pretty awesome.  Definitely give it a try.  So finally at the end, for the two of us, about $150.  Oh, and they give military discounts!  So I paid less than that.  Though they actually messed up my discount.  It's suppose to be 10% off and my bill went from $152 to $147.  Oh well.    So if you still haven't tried a churrascaria yet and you live in Vegas, you've now two outstanding choices to choose from.  Here or Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"For my Very First Review, I wanted to do a no brain-er.   This is by far the best restaurant I've ever been to. If you Love beef, you will love this place. At about $50 per person it is pricey but the beef has awesome flavor and it's all you can eat so get your grub on.   If you Vegetarian, you can get just the salad bar and it is still incredible. I can't give this place enough stars since it is the only restaurant that easily pleases both Carnivores and vegetarians!   I've been to this location several times and each time the food has been amazing. The truly greatest thing about this place is the consistency. Each time we have gone the service, food and experience has been the same. Amazing.   My personal Favorite is the House special. It has great flavor and is mouthwatering. The lamb is also great. each cut is great in it's own unique way. If you like well done or rare, ask the server and they will ensure you get it. Believe me you won't regret trying this place."}
{"text":"I was there with a group. I was a little disappointed with the small selection of meats brought out and how they did not service each table equally. Then they cycled us through to desert and seemed annoyed when I was not done eating and requesting more meat. Even if it was a group thing, it is still an all you can eat meat house! Unfortunately I have eaten at other Brazilian meat restaurants in town and have had much better selections and service. I still gave 4 stars for taste."}
{"text":"We had a large group of 17 for an early dinner and the team at Fogo de Chao were nothing short of amazing.  We had a couple small children & were accommodating.    The food, meaty delicious.  The salad/food bar, superb!  I will be back for dinner with my lady love and child"}
{"text":"We frequent this place for special occasions and it NEVER disappoints! The service is great and the food is always excellent. The Manager is almost like family!  He always greets us and chats.  He has made us feel welcome every time we have visited, checks in with us to see if we are okay and thanks us for coming when leaving.  On special occasions we are given the dessert menu and are asked to order anything we want. Now what restaurant does that? When you arrive the waiters bring you hot cheese puffs as soon as you are seated as well as warm Polenta sticks, mashed potatoes,and fried bananas.  I must say the Polenta sticks are to die for as well as the cheese puffs.   We love the market table for lunch.  Its only $15 with all you can eat.  There are many choices of salads,i.e. kale, Caesar, Bib lettuce, chicken & potato salad, cheeses, meats i.e. salami, Prosciutto, nova lox, apple fruit salad, hearts of palm, fresh cooked beets, asparagus, zucchini, and many more items. The basil dressing is my favorite. The full experience encompasses several sirloin cuts of meat, leg of lamb and lamb chops. rib eye, filet, pork, chicken, & ribs.  The full experience is around $32 for lunch and $50 for dinner.  Its worth every dime.  Many times on holidays they offer a $25 gift card to return.  They are constantly promoting specials for your return and believe me, you will want to return time and time again."}
{"text":"This is the first Brazilian steak restaurant I ever went to. I've wanted to go back for years but never did. We decided to go here today to start the new years off right. What an amazing experience! The food really is perfect."}
{"text":"Great Brazilian BBQ restaurant! We dined here on a Christmas night and the whole experience was a topnotcher, couldn't ask for any better. As we arrived on the restaurant, we saw that the parking lot was fairly packed, but that was all resolved by complimentary valet, there was no wait and the valet guy greeted us nicely and promptly took our car. As we walked in we mentioned that we have made a reservation and I was expecting to wait a little, as it was a busy night, but the host took us in and seated us right away. The place was fairly packed about 90% of the seats were occupied with multiple BBQ guys walking fast paced. I was expecting that the meat would come at a fast paced too and make us feel a bit rushed, but that wasn't the case, they were very professional. We enjoyed our meal at a pace we pleased and didn't feel any rushed. The whole experience of dining here was seamlessly effortless and felt that the workers were all very professional. Thanks for such a good service!  -Complimentary valet. -Waiter had great customer service. -BBQ guys are well paced. -Quality meat, loved their house special top sirloin."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant experience in Las Vegas.  Handsome servers.  Generous.  I love they have slice fresh jalapeños.  Fried bananas.  So yummy. Elegant decor.  I go everytime I'm in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends during Restaurant Week 2014. Two \"meals\" were available during Restaurant Week.   Lunch for $30.14 OR Dinner for $40.14 (tax and gratuity not included)   First Course - Salads & Sides Bar Second Course - Bread and Side Dishes Third Course - Sixteen Cuts of Fire-Roasted Meats Fourth Course - Selection from Dessert Menu  I researched to see what the difference was between lunch and dinner, and it had noted that lunch does NOT have beef ribs. I thought, \"hey.. those beef ribs are probably huge anyway.. taking up my picanha and lamb chop room\" so my friends and I opt'ed for lunch.   Quick Note: Those who are coming here for Restaurant Week, reservations are required and it must be noted that it is for Restaurant Week !   Decor - pretty nice ! Huge glass walled wine and alcohol cellar. Dark but each table is individually lit fairly nicely. Upon entry of restaurant, on the left is the fire pit. We saw a few skewers of the beef ribs (probably in prep. for tonight)   For those who are going for their first time, this is how Brazilian BBQ works. You have these \"Gaucho Chefs\" walking around with sword like skewers with various meats. You start at the salad bar to get a plate (can just get plate if none of the foods attract you -- mostly cold stuff anyway).   They have a system. You have a thing on your table for EACH person. Red = Stop. Green = BRING ME THE MEATTT ! Our waiter had mentioned that you'll have to switch periodically so you don't get a mountain of meat... I was like \"nahhhh....!!!\" to my surprise, he was right.. This is the first time where i was \"overwhelmed\" by the speed on how fast they were coming. I've been to a few other brazilian bbq places (Texas de Brasil, etc) and that hasn't happened... XD o well i ain't saddened !! thats good :D   SIDE DISHES !!!  Garlic Mashed potatoes - uhh to me.. this was very normal... nothing special... plain ol garlic mashed potatoes... no lasting impression like ones from Texas de Brasil   Crispy Polenta - polenta is a cornmeal made into fries.. plain but tasty. nice and crispy  Carmelized bananas - this didnt seem too carmelized to me. quite soggy and super soft...   MEATSSSS !!!  Leg of Lamb - very tender and nicely seasoned meat. surprisingly, was probably the best cut of meat we had during the meal.   Picanha - (Top Sirloin) with a fatty layer... little underseasoned. Cook was perfect. nice and tender.   Beef Ancho (Rib eye) - perfectly med rare temp. super juicy. tender ! little underseasoned  Cordeiro (Lamb chops) - woohoo lamb chops ! first round, it was actually a little \"overcooked\". medium throughout. still tender. second round, it was perfect med. rare. delicious :D   bacon wrapped filet mignon - not much of a fan of bacon but it was nice and tender. bacon gave it a nice flavor w/ the juicy and tender filet.   Dessert !!!   Papaya Cream - Fogo de Chao signature - definitely the LIGHTEST of the 3 desserts we had tried. Simply put, pureed papaya and cream. naturally sweet. good \"end\" to the fatty heavy meats XD   Molten Chocolate Cake - ohhh man DEFINITELY the HEAVIEST dessert picked... i had a bite of it... the word \"MILKKKKK ASAPP\" came to mind. SUPER SUPER rich... like triple/quadruple fudge brownies sandwiching cream... oh man @_@   NY Cheesecake - Topped with a strawberry glaze. probably big enough to share between two people, fairly easily.   Overall, not a bad experience. the meat was good. Little underseasoned if anything. Better than the salty meats of TdB where you'd be drinking water a lot. Service was great. Because i had a reservation, i was instantly seated upon arrival. good stuff :D +1 for them"}
{"text":"I reserve leaving feedback for very few restaurants.  Fogo made the cut after last night's dinner. Each time we visit this location we are blown away with the service, quality, and quantity that feed into the entire experience. Our criticism comes from a service standpoint, if you want to read about the food...move on to another review.  We were approached later in our meal to see if we were avid yelpers  in order to provide feedback for recognition. Derek, unbeknownst  to us, was the top salesman in wines and won 2/3 of the contests they last participated in.  He was rather discontent however due to the lack of financial stability he received with the shared tips policy.   This abundance of information was provided on our first interaction with Derek as he cleared our places.  This conversation  was the only negative experience we had during our visit. Our primary server Danya was superb in everything she did. I prefer iced tea and I tend to drink a fair amount when dining out. My glass never sat empty nor did my wife's. The sides were constantly replenished. When we wanted a specific cut, Danya made it happen with a quickness at that. I don't pay decent money for a meal to hear about problems of servers, rather to be well taken care of.  Any other day without Derek would pull a 5 star review hands down, and because of Danya,  a 3 star was avoided."}
{"text":"I dont know my friends I want to completely not write this because of a few things but here we go everything about this place food good alright would eat it again minus the fruit flys young lady who helped us kindly thank you I could see you cared and wanted to help young man Robert I think your the server that was assigned to us I saw you twice definitely needs a review rest of the staff seemed to care didn't make any fuss about it personally. what I could see was clean presentable prices were average for a steak house a little cold in the building but can be fixed by sitting in there patio very nice looking didnt sit out there got put in the table rite next to the bathroom ok by the bathroom hall way yes that table. this was a evening dinner not a very busy one iduno woulda been nice to sit with everyone else like I said didn't make a fuss I was thanful for the people who helped and my experience dosnt mean yours will be the same heck im a server maybe my expectations were too high good luck maybe ill try the other locations next maybe8)"}
{"text":"Found myself here for a second time due to a work dinner.  We had the opportunity to work with their banquet staff due to our large party in their private dining room.  First of all, if you need to make special arrangements due to coming here with a large party, this place has the best deal.  We got 2 drinks included with the meal (not limited to only wine and beer) and a wide choice of desserts were also offered within the cost per person.    Overall, a pretty good range of good quality meats where you need to come hungry and be ready for protein night.  My favorites, filet mignon, rib eye and lamb chops.  You get the best bang for your buck when sticking to steaks and lamb verses filling up on chicken and sausages.  But chowing down on their cheese bread is a must since it's incredibly delicious!  Service was outstanding when handling our large party and we got top notch attention throughout the night.  Carvers make sure to ask what meat temperatures you like and remind you to get your tongs ready to grasp your meat when they cut!    Perhaps there could be some improvement in the salad bar (ceasar salad gets pretty soggy quickly when sitting for awhile) but overall, Fogo de Chao does a really nice job all the way around."}
{"text":"Perfectly grilled slaughtered muscle meats and surrounding animal fats of various parts of the dead cow and other animals skewered onto 3 ft pitchforks nicely salted over charcoal fired flame and all served and thinly sliced for you at your table by simply flipping your chip green as in go on your table. A true cave man's dream delight.  You can easily destroy a months worth of red meat in just one sitting.    Ambiance, service, quality and quantity of food are five star.  Tip: ask for the picanha fresh off the grill and make sure you get the first outside cuts which have the most flavor from the salt and charcoal.  Don't even bother for the less tasty second inner cuts.  Even if you are vegetarian, their salad bar alone is a five star vegetarian's wet dream.  I've been to fogo de caos all over the country and they all have nice but different interior designs. If you can make it to their beverly hills location, it is quite impressive."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant twice now and absolutely love it!!  The buffet is always well stocked with delicious fresh vegetables, meats and cheeses but of course the real winner is the roasted meat that is carved at your table.  All the succulent cuts are wonderfully seasoned and cut at your table by temp you like.  We had the lamb, top sirloin and ribeye and everything was perfect.  Along with the great meal is great service, everyone is there to make sure you have everything you need at all times.  Finally you have to try their cheesy biscuits they are so great!  You definitely have to try this place at least once it is amazing."}
{"text":"Ahh Yelp Spring Break, so many deals to choose from, not enough money to spend LOL!  Made reservations here because of Vanessa H's review.  Our experience was remarkable. I've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before so I had little expectations. The only thing I did not like about this place was house easily they refill your food. The servers took a half-filled plate of mashed potatoes and replaced it with a new one. Seemed pretty wasteful. Same thing goes for the salad bar where they rotate or rather refresh the items every few minutes.  Yelp has made me very open-minded when it comes to food so I was able to try pretty much any of the meats they brought to the table. The house special was what hit the spot for me, as well as the lamb.   Even without the Yelp deal, I would willingly pay for this place. Which almost happened by the way, as the manager looked at my Yelp Spring Break guide with much confusion. He borrowed it for a bit and I guess educated his staff about it and everything went without a hitch!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I celebrated our wedding anniversary on August 12, 2017, and loved it!  Great food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"This is a gem! I usually shy away from restaurants that serve salad bars, but their Market Table is definitely NOT a salad bar, it is an array of fresh vegetables and sides. I am a meat lover so this was a perfect match.  I waited at the bar for my dinner companions, the bartender was friendly and skilled. When seated we were cared for by an attentive staff. It was an overall great experience. I travel several times a year to Las Vegas and usually stay at Red Rock Casino just across the street. I found this to be a wonderful alternative to the casino experience. Will make this a regular stop when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in for New Year's Day brunch since it is a short walk from the Red Rock resort where we were staying. Made reservations on Open Table. Didn't need reservations since we were 1 of 3 tables in restaurant. I like to use Open Table because of the points you can earn and redeem for gift cards and used a $20 card here. I did some homework before stopping by. They were running a holiday menu with special pricing at $50/person. Kids 6 and under are free and 7 to 10 are half price. Not bad since it was NY's day. We walked in just before 11:30am (our reservation time) but they weren't open yet. The posted hours stated 11am but it was NY's day and everyone was still recovering from their hangover.   The restaurant is nice. It was like a sauna inside. The restroom was like an oven. Take a seat, order some drinks, and get started with the buffet. Try the traditional Brazilian cocktail, Caipirinha, $9. Sort of like a margarita and martini mixed into one. The selection of food is wonderful. Lots of fresh veggies and cheeses to choose from. I enjoyed the sweet potato casserole. I appreciated being the first person to dig into it. I made sure to hook myself up with lots of marshmallows.   The meat will start coming after you return to your seat and the meat sweats will follow. Green means bring me the meat and red is I'm good for now. They started out with the chicken. Great flavor on that tiny piece of chicken leg. A few minutes after eating a server brought out some mashed potatoes and plantains. Then it happened. A serving spoon fell off the plate and shattered a water glass. The glass went flying everywhere. I noticed it fall into some of the food. I immediately took my son's plate and everything he just brought us. He thought I was crazy for passing back all of the food but I explained what I saw and he was apologetic. I did not like that he swept the broken glass on to the floor with my son right next to the glass. Not sure what he was thinking. My wife got a little freaked out because she pulled up her napkin a few minutes later and took some glass off of it. My mother-in-law wanted to leave but we just had them bring out new plates. We enjoyed the rest of our meal from there.   The different cuts of meat were very good. My favorite was the flank steak and beef rib. I was surprised to see my daughter chow down on the different pieces of meat. I was impressed when she asked for a slice of the NY steak and beef rib. One thing you need to try is the cheese bread/muffin. OMG those things were to die for. Also, if you are into asparagus they have some cucumber sized pieces, albeit they are served cold. One more dislike I had was the same guy who broke the glass brought us some sauces about 20 minutes after we started our meal. It would have been nice to have them earlier.   I appreciated that they brought my daughter a complimentary dessert for her bday celebration. We were celebrating over the weekend since her bday was coming up midweek. I wish my parents took me out to celebrate my bday. Haha! The food is good. I would like to try them out again without my kids. I love my kids but I didn't think it was the best place to bring them. I was more worried about what they would or wouldn't eat. Give them a try. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Prix fixe it up and OD on meat... oh wait, let me try to sound cool - protein, yeah! Don't forget the social media pic posts!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was GREAT !!  I find the dinner prices here too expensive when compared with other steak houses but lunch was reasonable for the same meats. The Garlic steak was our favorite !!  The roving drink cart at some locations is an experience as well. We very much like the salad bar."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located by My sister's Closet in North Scottsdale. This is the typical Brazilian steakhouse, except there's no grilled pineapple! I was greatly disappointed. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the display of circling skewered meat. My top favorites are the house special, the pork sausage and the garlic sirloin. Other than the parade of delicious meat, there is also the salad bar. Even though I enjoyed the different cuts of meat, after I've stuffed myself, I can't recall what I've ingested. If you're ready to be stuffed and experience food amnesia, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I've been here many times & every time is a great experience. If you love meat then this is your place. The different cuts of meat all seasoned well & all cooked right. The beef ribs are my favorite, they are seasoned only with salt & cooked to fork tender. I also love the salad bar, filled with fresh imported options. They had white rice with freijoda (black bean stew with pork meats), this side dish was a perfect complement with the rich meats. One thing that I really appreciate is the service, the service here is top notch & classy. The servers are always helpful & willing to give suggestions. This last time I went they suggested the limeade which is so fresh you can see the froth when they serve it to you. I LOVE this place & you have to try it."}
{"text":"Of course this is a meat lovers Haven, however I found the salad bar to be amazingly great. Such a nice variety of fresh fruits, veggies, and pasta's/breads...."}
{"text":"First time here and it was fantastic. There used to have this type of restaurant back home but it closed down before I could have eaten there. There is a salad bar which included soup, a few different salads, and multiple Brazilian sides/appetizers. My favorites were the Garlic sirloin and Rib eye. They have a good chimichurri sauce that can be requested. They also serve bread puffs and plantains, which was delicious. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I visited Fogo de Chão this week for lunch and it was great.   Salad Bar: You can easily fill up on the salad bar. Great selection and everything looked fresh.  Meats: The usual meats offered at other Brazilian steakhouses and everything I had was delicious. I often had to turn my card over so I could work on finishing what was starting to pile up.   Service: Service was great, plenty of attention with drink refills, offering meats, etc. There was a pretty decent lunch crowd but each time I turned my card over instantly someone was by my table ready to offer more meat."}
{"text":"On Valentine's Day went to Fogo De Chao for the first time. This was also my first Brazilian steakhouse experience. I am going back next month for more! It was very busy the night we went but we had reservations which I would suggest. We had great service from the team styled staff. The salad bar was good but I filled up on all the meat! I also loved the sides of mashed potatoes, fried bananas. My favorite meats were the Lombo (pork loin encrusted in parmesan) and the filet mignon."}
{"text":"Fogo is always good if you have the appetite. Waiters are always attentive, as long as you flip your card to green. The salad bar isn't as big as Texas de Brazil or other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to. Yeah, I know we don't come to Fogo to eat salad, but I like the options! Especially the pickled onions. My favorite cut here is the house special, on medium rare. The other cuts are great too. The only things I don't waste my stomach space for are the chicken and sausages. Only beef. And lamb. Come to think of it, they didn't serve lamb on my last visit. Hmm..."}
{"text":"Great service and food. The salad bar was a little sparse and uninspired compared to some Brazilian steakhouses. The meat was good but generally over cooked. They were accommodating to come back with medium rare cuts. The lamb chops were very delicious (my fav). They didn't bring the correct vintage of wine we ordered and didn't mention it until we pointed it out. A little sneaky as the one they brought was not nearly as good as the one ordered."}
{"text":"Mother's Day early dinner for our family of 6. Very disappointed with the meat mostly rare/raw. We have equally consumed and discard the same amount of meat. We usually go to the Flamingo location and we have been there several times and really never had a problem with the way they serve their meats. We decided to try the Summerlin location to support our community but they need to step it up. They need to prepare and cook their meat well. I understand other people like their steak rare but man... most of it are literally raw. I'm always a fan of Fogo but this one is disappointing especially for a special occasion and spending serious money for dinner."}
{"text":"This started as a 3 paragraph review of the restaurant, but I wanted to just review what our experience was for the night we went. We went on Valentines day and it was very crowded. There was a line out the door and down the sidewalk for everyone, reservations or not. I verified that they were accepting walk-ins and indeed they were. Had there not been a line for people with reservations, I don't think this would have been a big deal.  The salad bar, gauchos, and meats were amazing, but the level of service and execution for this nights event left a lot to be desired. With 2 full meal services and 8 drinks, the total with tip came out to about $240. At $11-12 a drink, and having only seen our waiter 3 times over the 2 hours we were there, this was grossly disproportionate in expectation.   Fogo had sent out a promotional email on the 8th offering a meal comp for making reservations for Valentines (14th-16th). In retrospect I should have avoided this window of opportunity and went any other time. Our prior visit to Fogo was exceptional, without question. But between the reservations line, poor landscaping in front of the building, being crammed in like sardines, the screaming kids, and the diner behind our table coughing on one of the Gauchos meat skewers, this was just extra icing on a less than stellar cake.   I wanted this to be at least a 3 if not 4 star review, but service and execution really made this a let down, experience wise. With that, I'm right back to where I started an hour ago. Still 3 paragraphs."}
{"text":"We ate as guests to a wedding party. Once it started the meatscame fast and furiously . It was topped off with some awesome desserts. The wait staff was very attentive. My two best cuts were the flank steak and pork ribs."}
{"text":"Where to I begin, small things that could be forgiven just added up.  Not to mention the MALE employee in the woman's restroom, not OK.  He clearly knew he shouldn't be there and when I told the hostess she didn't care.  I was so annoyed with everything else I just left.  As for the rest, restaurant wasn't ready at opening, it happens.  then waiter rushes us, took our menus before we touched them.  I get the concept but I wanted to look at selections, prices, drinks!  Nope!  The food I had was good but didn't get to try many of the options.  Then at the end we sat there with cleared plates forever, no server, no check.  Finally a server came back, no check in hand to leave again and take even longer to bring it back.  that is when I left and had the bathroom incident while my husband stayed to pay (we met and took two cars)  I stopped at a pharmacy with a line and still beat him home by about 20 minutes and that was just to pay, not counting the other waits for this check.  Overall not worth the price, rather go to a good steakhouse pay a little more and get good service and no males in the bathroom.  If it was coed then that is fine but it wasn't and he clearly knew he shouldn't be in there, just odd.    Never again."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was average. Some of the cuts were a miss and nothing really stood out. The polenta was good. They needed their premium cuts to come to our table more often. I would go back to try to see if it was just an off night."}
{"text":"First off, the food is excellent and all the meat is very well cooked and seasoned. The servers of the meats were amiable and fun. Loved the atmosphere and the sides available at the bar. The polenta fries are to die for and we devoured them. The cost is well worth it, and I will be going back. The one star knock is because our server was never around. We had a reservation and our section wasn't very crowded. After dropping us at our table he disappeared and we had several other servers pick up his slack. We still had to flag people down and waited a while between drink refills. Maybe because the tips go into a pool he didn't feel the need to make himself available, but we were unimpressed. He also overcharged us for our daughters meal since she was under 12 and when asked he said that the policy was under 11. Honestly the price difference wasn't a huge issue, but you'd think he would have abided by their published age after I pointed it out. I thought he was going to adjust the check, but he didn't and we got our check after not having seen him for over an hour from a different server. By that point we were ready to leave and it wasn't worth our time. I will go back again and hopefully the server will be better."}
{"text":"I am not sure we will ever go back. My husband and I did not have a pleasant experience. We weren't even offered all the meat they'd told us we'd get and the service was sub-par. I think we'll be spending our $100 at the Houston's across the street rather."}
{"text":"First I have to say the food is still amazing. My rating is due to extremely bad service we received tonight. It all started great, but once we turned our round things to green it went downhill. First I had to flag down a waiter to ask for sides. Apparently none of them thought to bring sides for the people with steak on their plates.  Once they started bringing different meats around one thing became very apparent- it was all sirloin and pork. So we had some and it was good, but we were looking forward to having some ribeye and filet mignon, so we said no to about 15 offers of more sirloin. At that point a waiter asked us if we were looking for a particular cut, yes, we said. He told us he would send some our way and we never saw him again. No ribeye or filet mignon either. The situation repeated 2 more times, none of them came back to check on us. Trust me, I would have been perfectly happy if they at least told us it will be a few minutes or they are out of it. But nothing.... untill maybe 20-30 min later someone offered us the cuts.  I ate the plantains we had as one of the side dishes and were not offered any more ( they used to always refill them).  And the last straw was that the waitstaff was obvoisly avoiding eye contact and it took us a while to even get our check I have been to different locations of Fogo de Chao multiple times and always was extremely pleased with service as well as food. Me and my boyfriend were very excited about going to my favorite restaurant but left very disappointed. What happened? New ownership? Trying to save money and first offer cheaper cuts of meat? Why was the service so bad? Would love to hear from the restaurant representative please"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Fogo for several years and it's always a great experience especially when Norma is walking the floor checking up on things. She is always so attentive and is the epitome of excellent customer service. She is a sweetheart and always with smile. She always makes our experience that much better. Thank you Norma!!!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place and decided to take my wife there for our date night. Having 2 small children, we don't get out much so we value our few and far between date nights. Everything about this place was amazing. The food was great and we left there talking about when we can go back! Our server was Teddy. I strongly suggest that you request him. His service was outstanding and I could see the table beside us felt the same way. Matthew was also just as good. He kept checking in with us and was there to answer any questions we had. This is one of those restaurants that you can't wait to tell your friends about. Keep up the great work and see you again soon... Very soon."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and it exceeded my expectations! The service, from the hostesses to each of the servers, was perfect. The salad bar had a good variety and quality of food. They served these delicious cheese bread puffs that were so yummy! The carved meat served at the table was absolutely delicious...I couldn't get enough of all the different meats offered.   If you are a true carnivore, then this is the place for you! Bring your appetite because there is so much to taste!"}
{"text":"Recently moved from Houston to Arizona. So happy they have Fogo here. We visited for lunch one afternoon and while the service was not the standard we expect from Fogo, Victor Lou N. came by our table and when we told him about lack of attentiveness of staff (never had anyone bring more side dishes and had to ask for more tea) he assured us this is not how they operate.   He told us come in for dinner again one night and give them another chance. He made our visit very worth while and when we get another chance, we will be there again.  If some of the wait staff know you by name, does that mean you eat there too much? :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing food excellent service we were a big party and they where nice and the service is impeccable. I love it and I will be back. Cameron and Minh are great thank you for the good service."}
{"text":"Okay I wanted to take my girlfriend out to a nice dinner and she's Brazilian so I figured \"why not?\" We arrived on a Friday night around 9:30 for our 9:45 reservation. It looked pretty busy so I think the reservation was a good idea. It saved us about a 30 minute wait time. The hostess was awesome and very patient when explaining the serving process. Which is pretty interesting if you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, but I won't spoil it!  We started with the salad which I had a heard from others that they could be better but I wasn't there for the salad anyway so I didn't pay to much attention to it but It was tasty. Then it was time for the real deal, the meats. My girlfriend said it reminded her of her grandfathers cooking! That's when I knew it was authentic Brazilian. I was speechless the flavors the tenderness and the juiciness of the meat was INCREDIBLE! My girlfriend was also super excited about the Guarana which is her all time favorite soda from Brazil!   She still wanted one more test. When one of the gauchos came to our table she asked him what meat it was in Portuguese and HE RESPONDED!!! I don't think they all speak Portuguese but the fact that one did told us that they really did bring the culture and the authenticity to the table. The food was amazing and the service was impressive. Definitely going back! This is as Brazilian as Vegas gets!"}
{"text":"I've always heard that Fogo de Chao is the best Brazilian steakhouse in the US, so after I had tried 8-9 different Brazilian steakhouses in different states, I finally came to Fogo.   Simply put - I liked the quality of the meat but was disappointed of the selection. The night we visited, they offered 16 different kinds of meat, but we never saw all of them coming to our table. A lot of the meat was very salty too. The price ($55 per person) did not include any grilled pineapple (separate charge for dessert), nor did it include any seafood option (a cup of shrimp cocktail was $21). The salad bar was small compared to every other places I've been.   The experience was not bad but also not amazing. I would probably only go back for lunch or if there is some promotion."}
{"text":"Came here to THIS location for the first time, during this years Restaurant Week :D I had once had Fogo de Chao for the first time, a few years ago, when it was participated in Restaurant week. We had liked it so much, we had looked forward to it the coming years... but for 1-2 years, they did not participate. BUT ! It came back ! woo !  We had a 12:30P reservation. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated by the window. Service was amazing. The waitress was super nice. Our waters were never empty and quickly refilled with any sort of depletion.   We were told to check out the salad bar while waiting for drinks and the meats to come out. Salad bar had a wide selection of fruits, veggies, cheeses, cured meats and a few hot dishes (didnt really look but looks like brunch items). As their flyer states \"Fresh seasonal salads, exotic vegetables, imported cheeses, smoked salmon, cured meats, and more. Fogo feijoada (traditional black bean stew with sausage) served with rice, fresh orange and farofa (baked yucca flour with bacon), seasonal soup, and more. Visit as often as you like.\"   The main course seems a bit more \"reduced\" than we had originally experienced before. The flyer online states:  -----------------------------------------------  Continuous tableside service of signature cuts of meat. Prepared, fire-roasted, and served by our gaucho chefs. Choices include: Picanha* (Sirloin) - Prime part of the top sirloin, seasoned with sea salt or garlic Alcatra* (Top Sirloin) - One of our largest steaks, tender and thinly sliced Fraldinha* (Bottom Sirloin) - Flavorful cut, with strong marbling Cordeiro* (Lamb) - Fresh leg of lamb Lombo (Pork) - Parmesan-encrusted pork loin filets Costela de Porco (Pork Ribs) - Marinated and slow-roasted for tenderness Linguiça (Pork Sausage) - Slow-roasted and savory Frango (Chicken) - Bacon-wrapped breast or tender legs  Traditional Brazilian Sides - Warm pão de queijo (cheese bread), crispy polenta, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas. Served throughout the meal.  Dessert - Choice of chocolate mousse cake, key lime pie, or tres leches cake.  -----------------------------------------------  When we were sat at our table, the waitress had asked us if we were dining normally or part of Restaurant Week. Originally we did not know there was a difference. She had swapped the cards you use to show if you had more interest in more meat or not from a regular round one to a heart shaped one.   Later we had looked at the flyer and had realized selections like lamb chops, filet mignon, rib eye, etc were not available to the \"restaurant week diners\".   We had seen the rib eye brought to us but the guy quickly realized it was not part of ours and walked away saying hed return. Another had brought lamb chops to us like he didnt care. The lamb chops was flavorful but quite overcooked to point where some end pieces of the bone would break off easily and the meat be overcooked a bit.   Aside from that, the picanha, alcatra, leg of lamb were delicious ! my favorite cuts of the day. We never saw the pork ribs or pork sausage. Chicken leg was pretty decent. Crispy outside, juicy tender inside. Friend noted his was a little on the dry side.   Warm cheese bread with a side of herb sauce was delicious. The herb sauce reminded me of this cilantro herb sauce my friend had introduced to me. Worked wonderfully with almost anything. Brightness from lemon with a nice, fresh herb flavor, and olive oil.   Dessert, 2 of us got the mousse cake, 2 got the tres leches, and i got the key lime pie. Mousse was nice and chocolatey. Really rich if you add the frosting and what not on top. But the cake base itself was nice and moist. Really the \"regretful\" cake. As for the tres leches. Super sweet, moist, but definitely sweet. \"diabetes on a plate\" as we nicknamed this. The key lime pie was the \"healthiest\" of the 3 but only by a little. Still a dessert in the end. Nice bright tart flavor from the key lime without the whipped cream top being too heavy.   Overall, still a pretty good meal and to a good cause. Worth the price for lunch and the yearly meal. xD Service was amazing as said previously."}
{"text":"Ah-mazing!!! Best experience in a long time. Come hungry!! Great service, unbelievable meats, amazing salad bar, and good wine selection. Wish there was one in Sacramento!"}
{"text":"I attended to soft opening for Fogo a few days before the opening. Despite this being one of their first run throughs, the staff were amazing and very professional.  The atmosphere is very relaxed yet upscale. Waiters are there at every turn and are prepared to assist you or provide information on a particular cut whenever you need it. They pulled my chair out for me every time I returned to the table and always had a fresh napkin or plate after trying different foods.  The food variety was excellent. If you have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you are in for a unique experience. The \"buffet\" was filled with a variety of vegetables, hors d'oeuvre, cold salads, cheeses, and cold cuts. There was also a hot bar with rice, beans, and maple bacon. The presentation was lovely and the wait staff are there to provide info and a fresh plate each time you went back for more.  As far as the meats go, they bring around several different kinds on large skewers and shave off pieces for you to try. This is where the red and green card comes into play. Turn it to green when you are ready, but be prepared to turn it back to red pretty quickly or you will find yourself overwhelmed with the amount of times staff will stop by to offer you another sample. Don't worry if you miss something once around. You can wait for them to come back, or simply ask your wait staff for them to bring it back again. This occurred at our table and once our staff realized we were seeking something specific, they had it out within minutes for us to enjoy.  Definitely come hungry and take your time! There is certainly no rush and trust me, you can fill up easily on the buffet alone!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of going here this past Sunday night and it was a delight. I'd been to restaurant of this style before and I must say it was just as good, if not better.  The food was prepared very nicely and the staff was trendy yet professional.  I will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I chose Fogo for dinner last Thursday night.  It was simply amazing.  I love fresh vegetables so I really couldn't stop at the salad bar.  The beets and asparagus were mouth watering.    We tried all the meats they offer.  They were all so yummy and juicey.  We enjoyed the mash potatoes, bananas and polenta.  The  service was amazing!  Can't wait for them to open their new location in the Gaslamp this summer!"}
{"text":"AWESOME! We had our wedding ceremony hosted here, roughly 60 people, and the whole experience was amazing! Mr. Machado was top notch in service. The food was incredible and the guests were raving about the speed of service and quality of the food! We couldn't have picked a better restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here on 7/19.  What an excellent dining experience.  Started off with the salad bar which was very impressive on it's own.  I had to keep reminding myself not to indulge too much on all the salad bar offerings so that I could try as many meat selections as I could handle.  Once the green light was given, the meat started coming.  All the meat offerings that I tried were excellent except for one, which is the only reason Fogo didn't get five stars from me.  The chicken breast was very dry, although I am sure that this was the exception and not the rule.  The rest of the meal was delicious which more than made up for the chicken breast.  The sides were also excellent and didn't stop coming either.  The service was friendly and attentive but not overwhelming.  We were never left wanting for anything.  And price?  More than fair.  For two dinners, three mixed drinks, a desert and a Bailys coffee it was about $175 with 18% gratuity.  I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Whole experience is pretty cool if you have never done it. It's a bit pricey but with all you can eat filet mignon, it's to be expected, salad bar is good and all of the meats were amazing"}
{"text":"We have been going to Fogo on a regular basis for quite some time. On this last visit, my wife and I were celebrating our 23rd wedding anniversary. Marco, the head server did an excellent job welcoming us back and getting us situated. The food, as always, was wonderful and they were very busy on this Saturday evening. I would recommend the picana, ribeye, bacon wrapped filet, and beef ribs. I'm a rib lover and not having to handle the large beef ribs is a plus. The salad bar is always great, but the meat is really where it's at.   The bar is fully stocked and I haven't been disappointed by any of the drinks that I have ordered. The wine list is fairly extensive as well. I usually order a Guarana Soda for the drive home to give me a bit of energy after such a large and very satisfying meal. This visit did not disappoint and the extra care exhibited on this special occasion earns them 5 stars. Excellent job!"}
{"text":"Went to Fogo for a large business meeting.  Service was great given the size of the group.  The food was incredible.  You start off with the salad bar which is actually pretty good.  There are a lot of meats, cheeses, and salads to choose from but if you're coming to Fogo, you're not coming for the salad bar.  The meats were cooked to perfection and with AYCE, I was stuffed.  There are too many meats to list, and honestly I wasn't sure what cuts I was eating at times.  I preferred the steak selections, but you just know what looks good when you see it.  The food couldn't be beat, but I wouldn't recommend Fogo for large groups/business meetings.  It got pretty loud while the servers were working their way through the room, and at times the speaker had to stop and let people get their meat fix.  Overall, this is a great experience with great eats!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing food, great service and very nice setting. A magical combination for a delightful time over a delicious meal, and hopefully... Interesting company. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Just went again for lunch and it was as good as I remembered. I will just not go on a holiday/special day in the future."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and We both really liked it the second time we brought friends and the service was less consistent that the first time but we had a lot of people check on us. I hate that I have to ask for ribs but love that they make it happen as soon as you ask. I also really like the chefs table and could probably eat enough there and never need all of the food to follow. It's definitely a welcome change to the average dinner out. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the meats are sometimes very dry, lamb in particular is over cooked and when I asked for some that was more rare, they brought me the same stuff. Also would like to see consistency in the quality of service."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao has great food and service; the atmosphere is upbeat and elegant. This is definitely the restaurant you want to be dining in when starving. It is seriously very difficult to say no to the many scrumptiously smelling meat selections that are offered by tableside service.  The concept is the same as with other Brazilian steakhouses. There are numerous meat selections of beef, lamb, pork, and chicken. Patrons control the frequency by which meat is served with green and red chips that stand for \"yes please!\" and \"No thanks!\" respectively.  There is a great salad bar with a selection of vegetables, cured meats, olives, mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, fresh cut fruits, imported cheeses. Served tableside are scrumptious garlic mashed potatoes, slices of crispy polenta, and caramelized bananas.   My favorite selection of meats were the lamb chops \" and the leg of lamb or \"Cordeiro\" followed by the garlic / sea salt seasoned sirloin. However, you will be offered filet mignon, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, rib eye, pork ribs, bacon wrapped chicken breast, port sausage, and encrusted parmesan cheese pork loin.  Fogo de Chao offers a full bar service and amazingly scrumptious desserts. From the bar, I enjoyed a Brazilian national cocktail called the Caipirinha. It is made with limes, sugar, and a liquor called cachaca. It was good, but the excessive taste of lime did not blend well with some of the meat choices - like the parmesan cheese pork lion.   I had the molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The chocolate cake has a warm molten chocolate fudge center. This was very good; the ice cream was a rich complement to the chocolate. Although I did not get to try the New York cheesecake, I was told that it was the best cheesecake my friend has ever had. I believe him too because he refused to share even one bite.   I wish Fogo would offer a cold gazpacho at the bar and tableside fried mozzarella, salmon, and grilled shrimp.  I love the male wait staff uniform - the pants are very sexy!! Our wait staff included Summer and Matthew. Thank you for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I understand 'meat sweats' a whole lot better after 1 night here. The meat was good, I didn't care for all of it. The salad bar was okay. Considering the sheer amount of food, the tables for large groups is not nearly big enough. The cocktails were good, seemed a bit on the weak side though. Waiter was friendly but the meat slicers looked like they hated their life. Not a place I would go more than once a year unless it was free."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place.  My boyfriend and I were in Phoenix visiting family and decided to try a Brazilian steakhouse.  Wow - I'm glad we did.  First and foremost, the food was INCREDIBLE!  The salad bar was one like none other I've ever had.  The meat does not stop coming (I especially loved the garlic beef).  I couldn't get enough of the bread and polenta.  As good as the food was -- the service was even better.  Every single person we interacted with was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable -- from the hostess to the bussers to the gauchos (the new word I learned for 'meat cowboy') to the manager checkin in.  There was a bit of a wait, but worth every second.  We will definitely come back when we are in town again.  Why isn't there a Fogo where we live in Michigan???"}
{"text":"Last night I ate here and man oh man! Was it filling! We had a reservation at 9pm and was sat as soon as we walked in (five before nine). We were showed the drink menus (minus one half of a  star because their list was small, and nothing seemed to jump out at us) then it was time to start the salad bar. The selection was brief, similar to Texas De Brazil. But also there was very small seafood selection. That takes away the other part of the star. But I came here for steak, so I can't complain too much because it delivered.   The only meat I wasn't a fan of was the chicken parmesan, it seemed dry to me but overall the filet mignon, sirloins, bacon wrapped sirloin, pork, everything was sooo yummy.   The best part was I love my meat rare, so everytime I asked for the rare cut they were all the same. Love the consistency.   The service was great she was constantly clearing the empty plates, and refilling the mash potatoes (they were soooooo good) I cannot remember her name. But she was very friendly, and all the workers move at a fast pace so it's crazy to see this place with all the food, tables, and people flying around. It's for sure a well oiled machine.   And finally we had a huge slice of cheesecake to spilt! Yummy! Our bill for two was 144$, so expect to pay over $100, the food was definitely worth it, service, as well!"}
{"text":"Food and service were fantastic. Left there feeling full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The meat never stopped coming.   Our waiter was having a bad day though. He wasn't the most attentive.  He kept forgetting things we've asked for. Aside from that, great place to go every now and them."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Brazilian steak houses, but the attentive service and food quality made this visit a memorable one."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect when I came here, other then copious amounts of meat. Our server was friendly and very helpful in explaining how the restaurant worked. They weren't kidding--when you turn the coaster over to green it gets INTENSE. Everything that touched my plate was AMAZING, with my favorites being the filet wrapped in bacon, parmesan crusted pork, and bacon wrapped chicken.  In the future, I now know to come HUNGRY. I filled up quickly, especially on the little (but delicious) cheese popovers on the table that they JUST KEEP REFILLING. There is a HUGE salad bar (to maybe alleviate the guilt of eating so much meat), but I ended up fast forwarding thru that to get to the good stuff.  My boyfriend ordered me a caipirinha (Brazil's signature drink) with pineapple and strawberries mixed in. Sweet, but very good.   Overall, Fogo de Chao was different then any other restaurant I've been too and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse!  If you are a meatarian, this is paradise. 16 types of meat, rotating until you say, \"no more!\"  The service was exceptional, they go out of their way to make sure you have a wonderful experience there.   My only disappointment was that they no longer serve chicken hearts, yeah... chicken hearts (LOVE IT) and they didn't have options of fresh squeezed juices."}
{"text":"The service was great, i didnt have to ask for anything they anticipated our needs and they were there in a snap. great food, good ambiance :)"}
{"text":"Crowded, rushed, inattentive service with small portions of tough meat. Bright sterile decor seems designed to hurry patrons out the door... if only someone would stop by the table and retrieve the check. A terrific disappointment."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food... Great way to get your protein cravings and ambiance is magnificent... The staff are awesome!Mahalo nui loa!"}
{"text":"Daughter and son-in-law treated us to a celebratory meal and drinks here. Food was great, service impeccable. We enjoyed the different flavors and tender cuts of meat. I would recommend this place to any friends and family that have yet to go out for dinner at any one of their locations."}
{"text":"Having spent a summer in Brazil, I love to eat Brazilian food whenever I can, especially at a churrascaria (all you can eat BBQ).  The concept is pretty simple...  there's a salad bar where you can get veggies, fruit, sides, and then waiters come around with giant skewers of meat where they will carve off slices for you!  What's not to love about that?  The meat quality was good overall and there was plenty of it.  I loved how they brought us plates of pao de queijo, mandioca (fried yucca root), and fried plantain.  The fact that they served Antarctica guarana was another plus.  However, negative points for not having two of my favorites at a churrascaria, the grilled pineapple and chicken hearts.  Overall, a good experience though, I definitely left full!"}
{"text":"Of course this restaurant is going to be pricey, because it's a Brazilian steakhouse. But, because it is more of an upscale restaurant, I feel like we had better service. Salad and side bar is amazing. The gauchos are friendly and never made us wait for the meat to be brought around.   We had a large party, and the whole restaurant was very accommodating. My older son is picky and didn't eat any meat, and ate minimally from the salad bar, so our server didn't even charge us for his meal, even though he is 14.   Will definitely return the next time we travel to AZ.  Oh, and an added bonus are the soft towels in the restroom. I know, it sounds weird, but when you're paying $50 per meal, the restrooms had better not have \"paper\" towels."}
{"text":"I went to Fogo de Chao last week during AZ Restaurant week with a couple of friends. Unfortunately, this place didn't really rise much past mediocre (read on)  Fogo de Chao is a typical, although nicely done-up Brazilian steakhouse establishment. The building is grand and colored in nice deep earth tones. It was a Saturday so it was packed, but nonetheless, we had reservations and were seated quickly once the whole party arrived. Brazilian steakhouses aren't really my thing, but I've striven to be impartial on this review.   First, the salad bar. There is a nice selection of things here including fresh vegetables, prosciutto and a giant parmesan that people hack into. So, on to the first two major demerits:  There was smoked salmon on offer, but the particular slab on offer here was frozen. At these prices ($19.50 just for the privilege to graze the salad bar, but comes with the normally $46.50 free-for-all per person price), this is a screw-up that is not even close to being acceptable for a simple salad bar setup, and of course the price compounds the level of disappointed that I reach. I know that Americans are into big, but the parmesan was puzzling given that this is a block of cheese that is either shaven or grated, or enjoyed in deliciously rich chunks. It was impossible to get a nice shaving out of this thing as there were no decent implements to get into the parmesan well.   Second, the meat service. There was a nice meat selection, and overall the meats were of good quality and quite tasty. However, I did notice that the cheaper cuts of meat were much more plentiful and forthcoming. Our table actually had to actively ask for them to send over the lamb, pork tenderloin, and beef ribs. We were also told that some of the cuts were unavailable. The complimentary sides were delicious. The cheese bread, polenta and bananas were lovely.   Dessert was just uninspiring, boring, pre-fabricated crap. It was free so I can't complain too much, but in normal circumstances they're probably charging in the high $9 to mid $10 range for a thin, crappy piece of what I think is anything but homemade cheesecake with an uninspiring combination of HFCS, sugar, red food coloring, and a couple of strawberry seeds that was the sauce. My friend had the chocolate mousse cake which was equally uninspiring and crappy. I'm not expecting a superstar dessert, but at least make an honest attempt at quality.   The booze is WAY overpriced. $12.25 for a \"Premium Caipirinha\" ... are you kidding? And, to boot, one of the things that pisses me off to no end (and results in major loss of critique points) at high end restaurants ... BILL ERRORS. We had a total of two cocktails and were billed for four. Simply, unacceptable. We weren't even brought a revised check before we handed over our credit cards for payment, and what's worse, not even an apology from the server regarding this $25 whoops on the bill. The only saving grace of that incident is that we were charged correctly in the end.  So,   Overall:  C to C+                Fogo de Chao has a lot of potential to be a great Churrascaria                as it bills itself to be. On this particular occasion it didn't really                rise much past mediocre given some borderline egregious                 failures in service and food quality. Some plus points for                great interior design though.   Food:     B-      (Big plus points for great meat. Minus points for the                           piss poor attempt [if I can call it that] at dessert, and                           frozen smoked salmon on the salad bar)   Booze:  C-      ($12.25 for a Caipirinha? Give me a break!)  Service: C     (Service was overall good. Near failure in service for                        the bill error. The only saving grace was their                        responsiveness when we asked for something specific)"}
{"text":"Two Words: Fogo-de WOW!  I used to live in LA and I would go to Fogo de Chao in Beverly Hills every now and then. I love their atmosphere - this is a perfect place for a large gathering or a date as it is very upscale.  The salad bar is very fresh and has a wide variety. I always get the roasted peppers, asparagus, and mushrooms. There are other quality ingredients.  If you're not hungry, just go to the salad bar and veg out.   They bring in some side dishes of garlic mashed potatoes, crispy polenta and the brazillian banana.  I tried all the meats that they had and my favorite meat selection: Lamb shank and bottom flank. They even had bacon wrapped chicken.  The service was impeccable and the staff appeared knowledgeable.   I will definitely dine here again!  Notes: -Double-sided Card: Flip Green for meat servers to serve you meat. Flip Red for service to stop."}
{"text":"I wish 0 stars was an option. Very, very disappointing. Maybe it's because I'm used to the Brazilian spots back in Chicago. I seriously had to ask for everything. Can you bring us more bananas? Can you refill our water? Our bread basket is empty. Jeez. I can't even use the excuse of them being busy because there were so many empty tables! The cuts of meat were horrible. They all tasted bland. The prices are high,  even for lunch and although I understand why Brazilian restaurants charge what they do, this place in particular is not deserving. I'm never going back and am spreading the word."}
{"text":"Food: The food is great, you get to try different steaks and can request different steaks if needed. The side dishes are good, although the rice was bit dry. Caipirinhas the typical brazilian steak was really good. They also have a ton of other choices as well from prime rib, roast beef, t bone steak, Leg of lamb was really good because the gamy taste was none existent.   Service: The service was excellent. The Gauchos were attentive to the guest, the drinks were filled all the time.   Ambiance: Upscale summerlin location great for dates, and the drinks that were prepared were good.  Overall: Definitely will come back for the food and service. So far no complaints on my end. I do caution whoever wants to try this place out SHOULD COME HUNGRY, that way you get to try ALL the cuts of meat."}
{"text":"Base on my visiting to this place, 3 stars is the max. The service was just ok for me. Took a while to have someone come over to ask for food. We gotta eat slowly since we weren't sure how long it would take for them to come over even we all ready turned the card to \" ready for new food \" or whatever they called it. As it's said that there were different kinds of grilled meat but I only tried 3 bc as I mentioned earlier, took awhile for the server to come over with the meat plus there were just 3 or 4 servers with same meat come to serve. And yes, the place is fancy and nice but 100$ for both of us (50$ for each) with all of these experiences, I dun think it's worth."}
{"text":"Second time at this Fogo. Food and service has been great both times. Always quick with the meat and service. Waiters and waitresses are always very courteous. I definitely like the ambience of this Fogo better than the one on the strip. It can get a bit loud but it's gorgeous."}
{"text":"Great bananas! (No, seriously though, best bananas ever.) Service is fast...almost too fast...\"I'm getting hammered with meat.\" Pork ribs are some of the best I've had. Prime sirloin is fantastic, as are the lamb chops. The sides are pretty good, but the salad bar is not my favorite...some of the options (the prosciutto especially) tasted old and dried out. Overall a really good experience though...just steer clear of the salad bar!"}
{"text":"Was out for a date night drive and passed through DTS and happened upon this location of the Brazilian steakhouse. The place was, well empty, except for another couple. Obviously the service was attentive and everything fairly fresh. The meats were well prepared though a few selections were a bit well done for my taste, however, upon asking for rare that was immediately changed. The drink selections were varied and what was sampled was well put together. The atmosphere is inviting and the staff friendly. Like every other Brazilian steakhouse it will dent the wallet, but certainly worth it. If your around DTS, give it a try."}
{"text":"This is a chain that started in Brazil. Having been to the original in Sao Paulo, I can say this place is every bit as good. If you've never been to a traditional Brazilian Rodizio, you have to try this place.  Start with the excellent fresh salad bar - virtually everything you can imagine, fresh vegetables, cheese, proschiutto. The main course is all you can eat grilled meats on skewers sliced right at your table - 12 different kinds.  The meats here are succulent and grilled to perfection. The meats include several cuts of beef, chicken, sausage, pork and lamb.  You must try the Picanha - Brazilian style prime sirloin. For sides there are wonderful plantains and potatoes.  You will not go home hungry."}
{"text":"My first Brazilian BBQ experience was really cool, and I'd give this place a 5/5 stars just because all the meats I ate were good. Plus, their side dishes were enjoyed by my sister, who asked for seconds and thirds (she's embarrassing). The salad bar also had a good selection of food. I liked how it wasn't just constantly the same meats circulation but different ones approached me each time. I think it's sick how they cut the meat directly onto your plate, although I know that's how it is at every Brazilian BBQ place. But since this is the only one I've tried, I'd say it's the best Brazilian BBQ I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Its a good place, overall i thought it was entirely too big compare to the one in Orlando, i felt you didnt get the romantic setting there because of the capacity of a lot of people in there, food was on point and valet service was great, I would stongly recommend if you are looking for that romantic setting, this isnt the place, Just way to big and i guess the only one in Arizona can have that effect.."}
{"text":"I love this churrasqueria! What a great addition to Las Vegas! I usually go to LA for my fix.    The ambiance is beautiful as well as the staff.  The salad bar offered and extensive array of typical salad items as well as some of their regional foods.  The salad bar looked like it could feature more items though...but then again you come here for the MEAT and boy do they serve meat...15 kinds I believe.    My favorite was the lamb (bone in) and the cheese bread is to die for..its also gluten free as it is made with yucca flour and I'll pretend it was fat free;) At first I was taken back by how quickly the meat kept coming around to our table.   Once you leave hear meated out, you can keep in mind for next time to come here for lunch Monday-Friday and still enjoy the same items served for dinner but for half the price."}
{"text":"Very tardy on posting this review.  We actually ate at Fogo de Chao last year (2016) for Thanksgiving dinner.  We chose this restaurant because our son doesn't like the traditional turkey dinner however my husband and I do.  Fogo de Chao advertised that they would be offering, in addition to their normal menu, sliced turkey and all the trimmings.  We thought perfect, everyone will get something they like.  Our dinner reservations were at 5pm.  We were seated promptly upon on arrival, however, when my husband and I went to the buffet station which was where the turkey was supposed to be located, there was nothing there.  We asked our server about this and were told that they ran out of turkey and trimmings earlier in the day.  As I said, it's not like we went for a late dinner, we were there at 5pm. Needless to say, we were pretty disappointed. The meat offerings at the restaurant were just OK, we've eaten at Texas de Brazil in Aruba and Florida, and the food was much better.     I sent the restaurant an email after our experience and got absolutely no response.  This certainly was extremely poor planning on their part, felt a bit like a bait and switch.  We will never eat at this restaurant again because of the lack of customer service, it seems like a response to my email was the least they could have done after ruining our Thanksgiving meal."}
{"text":"OH MAH GAWD! I think I was drooling through the ENTIRE meal! The salad bar alone was amazing and I could've probably just chosen to eat from their Market table menu but I can never pass up limitless amounts of meat! The selections were off the charts...so much to choose from and the quality was UBER impressive. If my pocketbook allowed me to eat here every week, I would! So I guess I'll just have to settle for bi-monthly! :-D"}
{"text":"Love this place! It is the best Brazilian steakhouse hands down. We went here without a reservation and got seated in less then 15 minutes. We had a drink at the bar and everyone was so friendly.   The salad bar was clean and everything was always full. They had an assortment or cheeses, meats, roasted vegetables, and different ingredients to make a salad.   The meat was amazing. If they didn't have what you want they would bring out what you wanted. If you want your meat well done they will put it back on the grill and cook it to how you like it."}
{"text":"One of my biggest regrets of moving out of Las Vegas was not eating at this place before I left!! The food here is amazing. The meats practically melt in your mouth and the owner, Ricki is especially nice and comes around to the tables making sure that everyone is enjoying themselves. He suggested I try Brazil's national drink, and although I was a bit wary of the price, I was NOT disappointed!! Even their salad bar is amazing. Do it. It's worth every penny. Dinner is around $50 per person but during their lunch hours you can get exactly the same thing for half the price. Do eeeiiit!!! Y.U.M.!"}
{"text":"Great service!!!! Customer Service manager Ryan was awesome! Will defiantly bring a group back : )"}
{"text":"Dinner at Fogo in one word- fantastic! My boyfriend (pescatarian) and I chose the Market Table option, which included everything from the salad bar plus a few hot dishes such as sweet fried bananas, garlic mashed potatoes, polenta, rice and beans, and tomato soup. Superb customer service, everyone went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat! Did I mention meat? This place is a meat lover's paradise! However, I am not a huge meat person, but my bf is... so I knew that I had to take him here. He absolutely loved it. They bring the meat by the table on huge skewers and side it right onto your plate - the ultimate meat indulgence!   My only complaint was that all of the things I really wanted to try like the filet minion for example, barely came by our table. While other types of meat like the top sirloin and bottom sirloin were constantly being offered to us. I felt like I was just waiting and waiting to try certain menu items! Fogo needs to work on varying up the choices that pass by the tables. Other than that, no complaints. The buffet was awesome, drinks were superb and when the filet minion finally arrived at our table it was perfectly seasoned, juicy and tender... yum!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse and I'm glad Fogo de Chao was my first experience! Meats were well seasoned and was simply delicious. The salad bar had many other items that were delicious as well. I loved the Brazilian cheese bread and the lamb! I normally don't eat lamb but this was actually the most tasty meat I had that night! Once we flipped the card to green, meaning we wanted meat, we had about 6 different types of meat that came to our table in less than 5 minutes! I have to admit, I was a little overwhelmed and wanted to try them all. If you don't see the meat you like floating around somewhere on a stick, let a waiter know and they'll find it for you. For us, we kept asking, \"where's the lamb?\" (It was THAT good!)   Fogo de Chao has an extensive wine selection and the soft drinks actually came in glass bottles -- which I found interesting. Location is about 5-10 minutes from the strip and is well worth the price!"}
{"text":"First time was on Friday 12/8/17. It's very fancy  The food is EXPENSIVE but the meat is so delicious Not a good place to go if you don't like rare meat because by the looks of it almost all the meat was rare. Which I love so wasn't complaining.  Desserts are amazing also. Try the caramelized pineapple!"}
{"text":"Food was good however be careful with soft drinks. Ordered a Sprite (it comes in the glass bottle about 6-8oz at the most) they kept refilling my cup without asking. I received my check only to see a $3.95 charge for 5 glasses. I was never told that refills are extra; highly disrespectful and unappreciated. Very hesitant about coming again based off of somethings so simple that is basic communication to the customer. Very disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"My husband and I made the right decision in picking this place to host our wedding reception.  I couldn't have been more pleased by the level of service and quality of food.  Ricci was amazing and was so accomodating.  The Gauchos kept the food and drinks coming and everyone had an amazing time.  We go to Fogo every time we're in Vegas and will continue to be loyal customers.  Thank you for such a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! Yes it was pricey, but oh was it yummy! All the servers bustling around you are continuously bring you more and more food. More then you one person can consume! The salad bar was unbelievably stocked with delicious things, several kinds of delicious cheeses, cured meats and veggies! When you sit back down and they start bringing you meat it is almost overwhelming. This is how meat should always be served, one hot mouthwatering piece at a time. Our plates were never empty. Then they bring out the cheese popovers, friend bananas, creamy mashed potatoes and friend polenta! OMG! Everything was fantastic and everyone stuffed themselves to the point we all had the \"meat sweats\" and waddled out! I will go there for a special treat again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Been to this location 3 times now. We enjoy it everytime. The meat is delicious (although a bit too rare for me at times-but hubby likes it) the bread they bring is so airy and yummy, the chimichurri sauce is amazing on the bread and any of the meats! Sides that come with the meal are great as well. (mashed potatoes, polenta sticks and plantains). I think the cost is worth it. It's interesting that all the servers take care of all the tables so you have numerous people checking on you. First time we ate there we ate from the buffet style items, but realized it was just best to save room for the meats lol. But it's there if you want it. Definitely our favorite date night place."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant twice in three days. If that doesn't say enough. At $50 a plate not including drinks and dessert we have found this to be the meat lovers paradise. Now that we have been here twice and we have found that you to eat very small portions at the beginning to figure out what meats you like then request the exact meat you want."}
{"text":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:  A somewhat-overpriced meat coma.  I am no stranger to Brazilian churrascaria/rodizio steakhouses, but this was my first visit to one here in Vegas. Accordingly, I walked in with the needle pointing-on-empty, looking forward to a serious chow-down.  Well, actually it was my second visit, if you count the time the week before, when I appeared about ten minutes before closing. That was on a Sunday night, when they close an hour earlier than weeknights. That visit led to a rather odd conversation with the attractive young woman at the podium greeting & seating:  \"Sorry, I didn't realize you were closing. I believe Yelp says you are open another hour yet.\"  \"Yes, we are getting ready to close.\" \"You should have the manager make sure it's corrected.\" \"Correct what?\" \"The closing time listed on Yelp.\" \"Oh. .... Yes, I'll do that.\" I turn to leave. \"Would you like me to seat you?\" \"But you just said you are closing.\" \"Oh yes, we are. They are going to start taking down the salad bar now.\"   Of course I was suppressing a serious urge to Wilhelm-scream: \"Then why the bleep would I want to be seated?\" But I just walked out instead.  They're not paying this attractive young woman greeter/seater enough. Because if they were, then they would be able to afford to hire someone more competent.  Alright, so the second visit, we get to the actual experience. This time, arriving more than an hour before closing, I was seated lightening-fast, without reservation, solo onto a four-top. Nice, no two-tops on the floor at all, that I see. Appreciated. The table was cleared of excess setting and the iced tea appeared swiftly.   Some Brazilian steakhouses have tiered-pricing, to match various tiers of meat accessible, or to add-on a lobster tail or salad-bar-only or whatever. This one does not, a singular price. But I had to ask about that ... since there's no menu. I would have appreciated a menu. I'd like to know the rotation of meats going-in as well as the price. But whatever.    I was actually a wee bit disappointed with the salad bar, as it was far less robust, as compared to my favorite joint back East. And that surprised me, from a management perspective. You want your guests to stuff their gills on curry-cole-slaw and such whatnot, rather than break-the-bank downing grilled lamb and filet. But whatever.  I usually hit the salad bar twice, then focus meat-wise on the best option or two. Couldn't do that here because (1) the aforementioned salad bar choices were limited and (2) I have no idea what the meat rotation will be. But whatever.  As the skewers started arriving, I just took a small sample of each, flying-blind, trying to find my way to the end-of-the-rodizio-rainbow. It took awhile. And most of those samplings had been roasted far too dry. The chicken was roasted to \"gag-u-dry.\" Also the names seemed designed to confuse. There was top sirloin and a roast sirloin, \"the house specialty.\" And, in the end, there were two types of filet mignon. But whatever.  Also, other venues have asked me at seating how I prefer my meats. (That would be medium-rare.) So the appropriate skewers could be directed my way. Here, that didn't occur until about six skewers in. So early on I got a lot of medium to well slicings. But whatever.  Eventually the second skewer of meat named filet mignon, medium-rare, landed. Ah, the end of the rainbow. This cut was perfection: juicy, tender, spot-on-pink, charcoaled-to-tasty. Now, however, I am full of these other dry, medium and well slicings. So even though I've scored the mother-lode, the belly-bloat & meat coma are kicking in, so I have to back-up. But whatever.  Just in case you were wondering about the price, with tea, tax & tip, I was $75 lighter as I waddled & wobbled out the door. I usually made out at my ATF back East at about $45 or so. Probably because diners there are mostly filling their tanks at the robust salad bar, keeping total costs down. But whatever.  Having now paid $75 dollars for my own tutoring as to how to navigate the slightly-murky waters of this venue, I could do much better next round, laser-focused upon the best of the salad bar, one-visit-only ... and then attack a skewer of filet #2. Even so, $75 for this salad bar and a nice helping of filet feels a bit too pricey, even for Vegas. I mean I can almost squeeze in-and-out of the Golden Steer at that price. But whatever.  So the next time I am cruising down Flamingo, I'll just slip a bit further down the street ... to Lawry's Prime Rib instead. It appears there I can snag a huge hunk of pink roasted meat, plus have them spin me up a salad table-side, old-school gourmet-room style ... for about two-thirds the price."}
{"text":"Does not seem to be the same.  Something has changed.  I loved going here, but the last visit it just seem different. The meats tasted a bit different too.  Could be me though."}
{"text":"First time at this Brazilian steakhouse and by far met out expectations beyond, the food was superb! Meats were so tasty, I didn't even need the A1 sauce :) All steak melted in our mouth, did not have one that was hard to chew. My hubby hates lamb but he was actually able to keep the lamb chop down cuz it was yummy. Service was above and beyond outstanding! All waiters, workers, and manager was friendly and show a high level of gratitude for our service. Highly professional...waiter called my nephew \"sir\" which was so cute ;) salad bar was fresh, didn't taste like out of the bag or freezer stuff. Highly recommend this steakhouse and price is right for the service and quality of food! Thank you all for making it a wonderful moment! Fogo vs Texas DeBrazil...definitely FOGO wins!!!"}
{"text":"Steak and chicken were dry (overcooked). Other than that the food was tasty and plentiful."}
{"text":"Definitely a place for special occasions for most of us considering dinner costs close to $60 per person. This place is heaven. Highly suggest this place to impress a first date or to celebrate a birthday for that special someone. They serve countless delicious meats, and each and every employee stops to ask how you're doing. They also have a great selection at the salad and cold meats bar. I've been here 4 times and each time has been just as good as the last. Make sure to call in for a reservation, and dress nicely. I swear it looks like some diners here are athletes and models."}
{"text":"Amazing food , filet Mignon is one of the best I have ever had .... Service was great always very friendly ... Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves Brazilian Cuisine"}
{"text":"This place is great! i loved the service!! I just didn't like the overcrowding where you sit. I found it extremely hard to get to the salad buffet from my table while the servers are everywhere giving pieces of meat. I almost always ran into one of them and if not them the the other diners lol! I also didn't like how it is super loud and a little bit overwhelming. Other than that the food and the service were great!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most disappointing visits to a steakhouse, and currently my least favorite Brazilian steakhouse.  We made a reservation and was seated within about 15 minutes of our reservation time.  Our server was very good and attentive.  However, the fruit and salad bar was mediocre (selection and freshness of fruits) and the steaks were overly salty.  I've had Brazilian steaks many times and at various restaurants but the quality of meat and the way they were cooked was not what I was expecting for a place that is highly advertised.    Plus, to get the house steak, we had to ask multiple times.  Surprisingly, the seafood bowl (a la carte) was quite good, but we didn't go there primarily for seafood.  The waiters and cheeseballs were great but you can get much better quality steaks elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fathers day came two days earlier for me and all I can say is WOW !! My daughters insisted on taking me to this restaurant  for a dinner. The moment I walked through the front door I knew the experience would be a memorable one. The service was outstanding and so was the food. I felt as if I was on a cruise ship being pampered by the crew. I've dined at may fine establishments in my time and this one will bring a smile upon my face every time I reminisce,not only for the fine food and service but most importantly because I had my beautiful daughters with me."}
{"text":"Went with 5 couples from our church to celebrate. The service was impeccable, the salad/sides/soup bar was fantastic with fresh and amazing displays. The meats kept coming and I was in heaven. It was hard to stop myself. My favorite were the fried bananas. You will not be disappointed. If you are a meat lover, you got to try this place and don't go alone."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Great food, awesome service. Try all the meats, request anything they have. Anytime you have an issue just ask anyone and its solved."}
{"text":"We are visiting from NY and so is familiar with this restaurant.  While it was a tad walk from Bally's casino (15 mins walk), we were very glad we visited this establishment.  We went Sat afternoon before 2pm so it was considered 39.95 per person.  Kids were half price.  The food is just plentiful with a variety of cuts from sirloin to lamp chop.  Everything was nice and hot.  Nothing was sitting out there cold and stale.  We asked for medium rare on all our cuts and they were absolutely spot on.  The serves come often and at many points, we had to turn the card to red just because we wanted to take our time to savor in on the food.  The salad and fruit selection was top notch.  Service from all the wait staffs were attentive.  We never felt like we were overstaying our time.  Definite worthy comparison to the NY chain.  There is free parking and free WiFi."}
{"text":"I have to say I am truly disappointed at the quality of food that was served here. Came here for Valentine's day celebration. They offer one complimentary dinner/lunch dining card if you dine with them Feb 10th thru February 17th. We made a reservation prior to our dinner which was a great move. When we arrived, there were so many people waiting for a table.   We arrived 20 minutes earlier, but was able to be seated at our reservation time. There was a huge salad bar section. Their salad items are freshly made!..I like its kale salad and its apple salad.   They offered a great selection of meat. Most of meats i have tried are mostly OVERCOOKED..even though i asked for medium rare, but most of meats are more like medium well. It was really hard for me to chew its rib eye, sirloin, lamb legs,  rack of lambs. The only type of meat that was cooked and seasoned perfectly was its filet Mignon. Most of meats are lack of seasonings and tasted pretty bland. I soon lost my appetite b/c all the meats are kinda blah...  I have noticed that they serve mostly top sirloin. I only saw filet Mignon served ONCE to us and we had to specifically asked for rack of lambs. All we saw are other type of meats (Top Sirloin the mosts)..I would say they purposely serve the cheaper meats...i would consider rack of lamb and filet Mignon more expensive, but only saw Filet Mignon ONCE and rack of lamb (saw it for ONCE..but it was soon gone..and had to ask for it specifically)..  Be cautious when they offer shrimp cocktails and champagne. Servers were walking around with shrimp cocktails and champagne. I thought they were included as part of \"All-You-Eat\" experience especially for the shrimps..but found out they charge EXTRA for that!...i believe the shrimp cocktails was over TWENTY DOLLARS...i was not too impressed by its shrimp cocktails..tasted kinda bland..  Overall, not super impressed by its quality of food. And they should have served more rack of lambs or filet Mignon if I am paying almost 60 dollars per person..I would rather go to a nice restaurant to get quality meal than a mediocre dinner.."}
{"text":"I've lived in Brazil for 2 1/2 years, worked at a Brazilian Steakhouse and been to many gatherings for Barbeque at Brazilian friends' home's over the years, and while this place is not perfect, it is very good.  Food quality: 4.5 Stars I can see. taste, smell the freshness and quality of every cut of meat and the salad bar.  Service quality: 4.5 Stars Front desk is average. Gauchos and Servers are great.  Price: 3 Stars If dinner was $30 or $35, we would probably go up to 10 times a year. As it is, I can only justify going 1-2 times per year, outside of when they send me a coupon.  WHY SO MANY POTATOES???? Scalloped, baked, potato salad, mashed, etc.  Trying to fill us up so we don't eat so much meat?  I thoroughly appreciate the salad bar, even though i only put a few things on my plate before i let the meat finish me off.  All of the meats are prepared with great attention and detail. I even was able to try the leg of lamb and lamb chops.   Picanha and the Filet Mignon were my absolute favorites, while the sausage was unique and tasty too.  Take your time and don't let them run you out before you are done. At times, I feel they are trying to just turn over my table. When i am footing a bill well over $100, i feel like i should feel the service saying \"fica a vontade\", which is not always the case.  I will likely return for my birthday...or any other time they send me a coupon.  Fogo, thanks for \"matando saudades\" of Brazil for me.  Obrigado."}
{"text":"This would be my second time dining in a Brazilian steakhouse. The ambiance wasn't what I expected , it had some sort of cafeteria feel to it. We waited at the bar for about 30 minutes for our table, meanwhile we had some of their specialty cocktails. I had their mule and my wife had their fruity lemonade cocktail, both were really good and refreshing. We got to our table , our server seemed pretty professional but didn't take the time to explain how their system worked (I had to assume based on another Brazilian steakhouse I went to) we went to the salad bar and I was not impressed. Everything was ok tasting and seemed fresh but I expected more variety. We then flipped our card to green ready for some meat ! Everything was just \"ok\" nothing spectacular. Our server disappeared and was replaced with some lady who was actually more social. They gave us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary which was unexpected but awesome !"}
{"text":"Note to self: fancy place, not the greatest restaurant to take your 14 mo old on a whim and  you and your hubby are wearing casual wear.  With that said, even though we looked out of place, we still had a great time and the service was excellent!  We never get our money's worth in these type of churrasco restaurants because neither my husband nor I can pack it in.  However, the meats were delicious and their appetizer/salad spread was yummy, too!!  I love hearts of palm and mushrooms so this was right up my alley but they also had \"normal\" stuff too like potato salads and regular salads and the like.  Great place for a date, especially if you want to impress.  You can go in there in casual wear, too, as we did, but it is more of an upscale type establishment.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome meats, terrific service! I just wish the market table had more variety to it but all our servers made us feel right at home and cared for!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here while we were in Vegas last week. We were only gonna have a casual dinner, so we weren't expecting too much. Turns out the food and services were absolutely amazing which surprised us a lot.   Service: There are a very wide selection of meat choices that servers go around and bring to your table. They gave you a piece of round plastic that is red on one side and green on the other side to indicate if you want to get served or not. The service was really fast once you turned your plastic piece to the green side. Our waitress constantly check on us and make sure we have enough water. The manager checked on us once as well and he is very friendly and approachable, we even chatted a bit while my boyfriend was in the restroom lol.  Food quality: Every single kind of meat is delicious, I especially liked garlic beef, simple name, but the meat tasted so soft and it melted in my mouth. The seasoning was on point as well. They also gave us 2 dishes for free at first. I am a bacon lover, they also have strips of bacon at the salad bar that are free to take as much as you can eat. The bacon is crispy and you can choose to put brown sugar on it which is served at the side. It was so satisfying. At last, we got dessert which is a piece of roasted pineapple and 2 giant scoops of ice cream. The pineapple was juicy and sweet, and the ice cream is in giant portion.   Environment: Spacious with a lot of people, not too noisy for such a huge restaurant.  Tip: Reserve a table if you will arrive after 8:30. They only take reservation after 8:30, there were a lot of people when we arrived after that time so it's still worth the time to call them beforehand.   Overall-10/10 would go again!"}
{"text":"We had a neighborhood dinner here last night. The service and food were both excellent. We particularly enjoyed the filet mignon and the lamb chops."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend this place. Everything was absolutely perfect. Staff was very friendly. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We ate here on Saturday and the food was fantastic. The reason for the three star is because I used the restroom before eating, which was a huge mistake. I had to try Not to think about the bathroom while eating to get through my night. The bathroom needs to be blown up and renovated, or maybe just cleaned. It was so very disgusting and it was only 445 pm!"}
{"text":"Simply like no other place. The service, the food, and entire place are awesome. The lamb chops, oh my God, do delicious."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Fogo de Chao in years and finally went back. I've been to the Los Angeles location couple of times but don't remember it being so good. Well, this past month I was in Vegas and decided to go  there with my boyfriend. It was his birthday so def wanted a nice casual place with good food! The staff was very attentive and sincere. The food was amazing but I didn't really enjoy the salad bar too much. The side dishes were amazing! The manager saw one of our meats too cooked ( I like my meat med rare) and he made sure we didn't eat the one we were served. So observant the manager was! He brought out fresh cooked meat right away. We def enjoyed our time here and when I visit Vegas again I would go back. Food and good service is a must at all restaurants. Fogo de Chao impressed me with the quality and service. ohh and our papaya ice cream at the end of our meal hit the spot. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Dining room was incredibly bright and that killed any shot at ambiance. Restaurant is very tired and needs a refresh.  Definitely not up to the standard we expect in Scottsdale--I am a local.  Our table top had large areas of material missing which was visible through the tablecloth.   The food was ok, much if it was over-seasoned with way too much salt.  The meats tended to be very high fat and not well trimmed.  The salad bar had some odd items and lacked some of the basic items you would expect... cheeses, various seeds, croutons.  I've been to other locations and had a better experience."}
{"text":"Quality, quality, quality.   Top notch service, food and experience.   Great steaks and meats all for a fixed price and all you can eat!! WHAT?!!  If you're not there for meat, you can choose to go with the salad bar which still has some great options and then the a la carte menu that has other options like seafood!"}
{"text":"Unlimited portions of variety of meats: beef filet, top sirloin, lamb, pork, chicken and sausage. They just keep bringing to my table. Experienced waiters provide professional service. This is a great place and a unique experience."}
{"text":"Been to different locations but wow this specific one has outstanding service! Starting from Min to JR, I have to go out of my way to give them acknowledgment!"}
{"text":"We are out visiting from Orange county Ca and decided to to dine here for our sisters birthday. The service was perfect, the staff was on point, and the food was Amazing!!! I will definitely be coming back to this location not to mention the locations at home. Thank you for making our night special."}
{"text":"Two for two!  I really don't eat out much because besides good fries, sushi, and an occasional fish I cannot buy, we make everything at home better than I can pay for it.  This place is awesome!!!  Table wine is worth having a classic Brazilian cocktail and then just enjoying. Done get salad bar first enjoy the meats, fried banana, then supplement - a little prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato, and greens.  Thank you"}
{"text":"I enjoyed their prosciutto at their salad bar it was by far the best I've had ever. I wish there were more options at the salad bar and soup options. Their meet was amazing, I enjoyed all their steaks. Our server was a little off and couldn't tell us their beer selection so then another server took over. Great food... wish the salad bar was better."}
{"text":"Service was awesome! The guys were very polite and had a really good mood all the time. The meats were tasty and pretty good. I was disappointed with the salad. Broccoli was almost like ice, not good. Variety was not good. Overall 4/5."}
{"text":"I love food, yet I am admittedly not a huge steakhouse guy. So I have not been aware of the growing popularity of Brazilian steakhouses as a \"thing.\" And Fogo de Chao is apparently the apex of the Brazilian steakhouse experience. And so it came to pass that an opportunity came to check out Fogo in Scottsdale (hey, it was either this or Benihana) so we said, what the hey, and pulled the trigger.  So Fogo has a unique structure. They have a salad bar, which - by itself - could be and is a draw. They have a great selection of coldcuts and cheeses, delicious pasta salads. They have a hot food bar with rosemary potatoes, scalloped potatoes, wild rice, black beans and that I could've easily filled up. But no. No, listen to me. Do not fill up on their polenta sticks, plantains, and puffed bread. That's a ruse to keep you from the honeypot.  'The honeypot?' You say, quizzically.  You see, once you're seated at Fogo they give you a card. One side is a red stop sign. The other is go. Sure, without it, they'll bring you some great mashed potatoes at first, but once you flip green. Boom, you are in the danger zone.  Meat will come. From so many people. Meat on a stick. Parmesan pork. Top sirloin. Bottom sirloin. Filet mignon. Bacon wrapped chicken. Even bacon wrapped pork. Plus lamb shanks and more more more!!!  In all seriousness, the cuts of meat are great and varied. From well done to rare and a singular experience that'll make you feel like a king.  The food there is delicious. The experience is pretty epic. Good for a birthday, anniversary, dental graduation. And it beats Benihana.  It is expensive. Between the two of us, after wine, the bill was almost $200 dollars, so not an everyday kind of thing, but good on occasion but definitely felt worth the money."}
{"text":"Service was attentive, quick, place is nice.  We did the weekend dinner   The little cheese breads are not very flavorful but texture is very addictive , they brought extra without fuss :) Salad bar meh  Meats :)) delicious flavors, char, crust, mostly properly cooked.   Price... lol. I ain't rich enough to come here every month plus I can't eat that much to justify the spend."}
{"text":"Marathon meat madness!!! We were lucky to go for Restaurant Week to enjoy the special price and dessert included. It's spacious inside and although there were lots of people, we were seated in an area where we were far from other customers. The staff here is really exceptional. If you were in a meat eating contest you could win.   I got up to check out the salad bar and when I returned everyone at my table was getting their meat on! It felt like a race to the finish line. We had nonstop meat guys offering various types of meat to our table. I had to quickly put the red \"stop sign\" up so they won't offer me anymore. Help! I was drowning in meat starting to lose my hearing and entering a meat coma!  I enjoyed the bone in lamb, filet mignon, and ribeye the most.   The polenta sticks were to die for as well as the cheesy bread and plantains. The mashed potatoes were nothing to waste your time and tummy space on.   My only gripe was a few times I asked for medium and got well done. So maybe ask for rare and you will get medium.   We never once had to flag down any waiters because they were constantly filling waters, taking plates away, and very present.   Ask for the chimichurri sauce, homemade hot sauce, and homemade BBQ. It really compliments the meat well.   The dessert could be better. But I guess you don't go here for the dessert. My guava mixed with ice cream is what he called it, but I would say it's more of a guava pudding tasted very artificial. I did not eat it. My hubby got the turtle cheesecake and although it was good, it felt like a little bit like a supermarket cheesecake. I supposed I would think there might be choices such as Brazilian style flan instead of cheesecake.   Regardless the food was top notch as was the service."}
{"text":"MEAT!  That is what you get here.  Every time I have gone the service has been outstanding.  They will keep serving you until you keel over and die from a heart attack so be aware of the stop sign!  The salad bar has quite the selection as well, but I would minimize your intake here so you can try all the MEAT!  My one complaint is it seems like most of the MEATs have similar seasoning.  They have a large variety of different types of MEAT, but at some point it just all tastes the same...maybe I just have MEAT overload at that point.  This is definitely a place to experience, but I could never go here regularly.  I myself would rather go to a gourmet restaurant and have one great meal rather than gorge myself with MEAT, but I can see the allure of Fogo for sure!"}
{"text":"Perfect Father's Day dinner. Reservations were on time, no waiting. Service was excellent and the food could not have been better. Even their desserts were perfect. I would go back for any special occasion. It's a lot of food so plan a few hours to enjoy it. They don't push you out the door."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao reaffirmed that I love meat. Thank you so freaking much!  I will say that the integrated Yelp reservation system does wonders, I highly recommend it.  The meal comes in two phases: salad bar and served meat. You'll get some side dishes, and meat carvers will come to your table to offer you various cuts and cooking temperatures. They actually carve a different part of the meat block depending what you want, which I thought was really cool. Technically they're only supposed to come when the card they give you is green instead of red, but they came nonstop anyways and I love them for it.  Keep in mind with this high end service and variety of meats the meal will be somewhat expensive, around the $50 range. However, if you haven't gone I suggest you do, because this sits at my Top 5 Restaurants of all time right now.   And as much as you love meat... please don't come alone. The more the merrier, otherwise you'll just look like a sad pig rolling in the mud."}
{"text":"Superb service and food! I think this location surpasses the other located on Flamingo. All of the meats here were tender, extremely flavorful and unforgettable. The entire staff here is by far superb! Minh was our server and he was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"It was an easy choice to have our wedding reception at Fogo de Chao. We knew the food would be endless and delicious. Ricci also made the decision easy for us with her responsiveness, professionalism, friendliness, and eagerness to make our wedding reception go perfectly.  Fogo de Chao will have 3 options for your guests depending on how much alcohol you will want to serve. There will be a no-alcohol option, a 2-drinks-prepaid-per-person option with desserts and coffee (about $117/per head after taxes and gratuity), and an open bar option. We went with the middle option for 46 guests, and hosted a full-on reception with dancing, a DJ, an impersonator entertainer, and dinner and dessert.   Working with Ricci, we were able to pick the perfect room size. You have to ensure a minimum amount paid for food depending on the room you pick. For us with just under 50 people and needing room for a dance floor and the DJ, the room fitting 60-80 people was the right size. We didn't have to pay extra for the extra room - 46 guests was enough to cover the price.  Ricci spent hours on the phone with me as I went back and forth between her and the DJ she suggested to us to ensure that the timeline and plan were all set. She was so patient and professional and made us feel confident and assured throughout the whole process.  Now, to the food. If you have ever eaten at Fogo de Chao, you know very well that the wait staff dressed as Gauchos are very attentive to whether or not you're \"green\" or \"red.\" For those who have never been to Fogo de Chao, the way it works is, gauchos come around with all sorts of meats-- filet mignon, NY strip, bacon-wrapped pork, roasted chicken, sirloin, \"Brazilian style\" steak, etc.. Meanwhile, the diners have a flip card with red for \"don't come and give me meat right now\" and green for \"please come over here with that spear of meat you have.\" The gauchos then slice a portion of the meat on their skewer onto the diners' plate.   This is in addition to a buffet-style market table which has soups, salads, and side dishes. The diners get to choose one dessert among several options including NY cheesecake, chocolate cake, and creme brûlée.   Amazingly, at my own wedding, I was able to try several of the desserts in addition to a cappuccino, and it was all so very delicious. Everyone raved about the deliciousness of the food. I think people were so caught up in the deliciousness of the food that they didn't drink much because we were well under the 2-drink-per-person limit. I wish I wasn't so busy entertaining and got to be a guest!  The only shortcoming was the lack of options for our 3 vegan guests. Indeed, the wait staff was very attentive to their needs, but I was told by the guests a month later that, well, the market table wasn't too accommodating to them since everything from the vegetables to the mashed potatoes had butter or cream in it. This obviously did not hinder my or 43 other guests' experiences, but since I did ask to accommodate them much in advance, I did expect a little better than this. Obviously, Fogo de Chao is a Brazilian steakhouse, which is anti-vegan by its design, so I'm not even sure if this is a real shortcoming.   I would have my wedding at Fogo de Chao Las Vegas again in a heartbeat! Thanks again for an incredible wedding reception, Ricci!"}
{"text":"We dined here on a Saturday night and were promptly greeted and seated. It was our party's first time at a Brazilian steakhouse and the host gave us a quick overview of how everything works. I was surprised at how quickly the meat service came out, and each an every cut was delicious! Minh took care of us all night and everyone left satisfied. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ cuts from filet mignon to sausage.  Name it, lamb ,beef ,pork ,chicken.  Also great salad buffet and excellent service."}
{"text":"VERY Disappointing Experience! Been to several Fogos across the country and have always been pleased. Been to this one before and was also pleased THAT LAST TIME!!! - NEVER AGAIN!!!  The greatest difference I saw on my recent visit, was that they are cramming more seats in the space than should be. In fact, it may even be at over capacity for safety... I KNOW it's over capacity for decent SERVICE!  We were seated for our 7pm reservation, promptly; however we had to weave our way through the many too close tables to get to ours, which was right next to a server station... Not a problem,,, this will insure good service!  ...NOT!!!  We were greeted quickly, and our two guests had the \"how it works\" info presented... when we saw a slight break in the masses, we began at the salad bar. While I don't like the serve yourself experience, it is a great starter/first course buffet, with interesting selections. HOWEVER... bring your pads and helmets!! The masses attack!!!  Within seconds, the waaaaay too many tables of hungry customers attack the line... pushing, invading your space, reaching in front of you to get their asparagus, dressing, etc. It's NOT a pleasant experience, ESPECIALLY, when you're paying high dollars for a dining experience!  The customer etiquette is not the restaurant's fault; however, packing too many people in... IS!!  They are putting their short term profits in front of their customer's experience!  It's NOT going to work... for the longterm!  In addition, the server's rushing and bumbling pace was stressful and exhausting! Again, they were all rushing around to try to meet the needs of the waaaaaay too many tables crammed into the space.  After our First course, we flipped the coaster to GO. Other visits, the many server/chefs come to carve off some delectable meats. This time, we have only 3 or 4 visit our table... the meats were great, but where was the chicken, the prime rib, the sirloin, the lamb.. It wasn't until later we realized we hadn't had many selections.  After we had finished... we waited....and waited... and waited for a simple \"how was your meal?\" Or... \"would you care for any desert?\" Or... a \"can I get you anything else?\" or even an acknowledgement that we even existed!   I finally stopped a \"blue shirt\" (manager wannabe?) rushing by... told him that we were feeling ignored and that \"no one would talk to us\".  His response: \"I'll talk to you... What do you want to talk about... The weather?\"  Normally I would have kicked his ass with this smart assed remark; however, it took me by surprise! I was stunned, embarrassed  and speechless! Our guests asked for coffee and he ran off... never to be seen again. Coffee showed by someone else and we asked for our bill and left.  Again... Food excellent... Atmosphere is LOUD and CRAMPED... Service sucks and the \"blue shirt\", manager wannabe, needs his ass kicked!   NOT going back and recommend that you don't until they start putting their customer's experience in front of their rush - rush, pack  'em in and move 'em out\" attitude."}
{"text":"I'm gonna go with the people that said the meat had no flavor. The buffet portion was nice, but overcrowded. It took away from ambiance of being a \"nice\" restaurant. The garlic beef & lamb were my favorite. Don't get dolled up to go, everyone was dressed pretty casual. The service however was great. We had the same waiter the entire time & we stayed around 2 hours. I think this place is more about the experience. You have to try it at least once. I ordered the tres leches cake to go & it was way too sweet, something I never say. The polenta fries were awesome & the fried bananas tasted like old overripe bananas repurposed. If I ever go back I'll probably just order from the bar menu, but that's only if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First time at this location and I'll say, not disappointed at all. The staff was on point and very friendly, food was absolutely delicious and I'll definitely be coming back to this establishment in the future with family, friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much, I ate lunch here two days in a row!  Manager gave us a tour of the kitchen.   Best Churrascaria I've ever eaten!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place a lot. Short on 1 star due to slow rotation of meats. We expected to be there 1.5 hours but it took over 2 hours. We had to ask 3 times for the lamb chops and they were way over cooked. But we left full and still enjoyed the feast and service. The palm hearts were excellent as was the smoked salmon. We had a good time."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao is a place for the vaguely gluttonous meat-eater who enjoys watching the fine-tuned ballet of service whirl around the room with roasted meats and downward-pointing carving knives. We went for restaurant week ($44 a person with an unexpected dessert included) on a Saturday night and the giant space was PACKED. The service was completely stellar though with a host of waiters, meat presenters, clean-up crew, and managers checking in with us for the whole experience. Our waiter guided us through the experience as I had not been to this particular Brazilian steakhouse before, suggesting sauces, pointing out special items on the More-Than-A-Salad-Bar farm table, bring the side dishes of mashed potatoes, plantains and fried polenta, and making sure out favorite meats made it to our table. The salad-bar cold options table is great with items like marinated mushrooms, roasted vegetables, imported cheeses and cured meats, pear and endive salads, hearts of palm, and much more. If I was a vegetarian, this would go on my list of lunch places just for the salad bar options alone as they are much more exciting than a selection of spring mix. The meat selection was a bit more standard American fare than other Brazilian steakhouses to which I have been, but everything was cooked so perfectly it was amazing. My favorites were the beef tenderloin (for which I waited a couple times for the perfect medium rare slice), bacon wrapped filet mignon, parmesan crusted pork, and the roast lamb, that had a lovely seasoning on the outside yet was perfectly cooked and juicy in the interior. (Special kudos for Dan, one of the managers, for being so friendly, checking in with us several times, and orchestrating the return of the beef tenderloin when I missed it the first time.) Drinks are pricey by general Arizona standards, yet pretty expected by Scottsdale/city rules - I particularly loved the passionfruit caipirinha. Overall, we had a wonderful time as the food was great, service was amazing, and just watching the whole experience in the general dining room was entertainment in itself."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant I have ever been. The servers was great. The food was excellent. I love the look of the place. I have been living near by for 6 months and didn't know it was this close. Will be back soon. Must go!!!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly, attentive staff.  Food was good.  However we felt under attack by gnats...yes, gnats.  They were fluttering around our dinner table all night.    When we left we still felt like they were on us...ugh.   Off to shower and get the creepy bug feeling off.   Just received my AMEX bill...apparently the server decided to add an additional tip for themselves.  Currently setting up a fraud case with AMEX."}
{"text":"We went there for thanksgiving dinner.  We had reservation @5 waited maybe 5min & seated.  That was our second time @ Fogo de Chao.  Food was amazing & service was fantastic!!!  Amanda was our server & she was doing great customer service make sure everybody having good time.  She told us that there will be xmas dinner also this year.  :)   I will be definitely coming back.   Thanks Amanda!!!!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot from 1004 reviews averaging 4.5 / 5.0. I was disappointed with the selection, food quality, and service.  The salad bar area did not impress me and I noticed a few of the bowls, especially with cheese, to be empty or nearly empty.  Meat selections were adequate, but the only meat that I though was notable was the pork chop. The beef and chicken were average, as was the sausage.   After drinks were ordered it took some time for the first server to arrive with a skewer of meat. As there were about 15 in our party, it tool a lot of time for that single skewer to get around the table. The timeliness of the meat servers was poor."}
{"text":"what can i say????? love! love! love everything about Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse!!! i'll definitely be back for more!!!!! The meat/chicken/and everything just keeps coming and the servers are all smiling and pretty attentive.   Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Some brazilan food is good. The place was super packed and I can see why meats and service were top notch I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Not a positive experience. Beef was undercooked, even for a medium rare person and the chicken over cooked and dry dry dry. Probably would not return."}
{"text":"I returned to Vegas and chose Fogo de Chao to do some business and re-unite with some old friends. I have eaten at this chain before including some in Brazil.  They never disappoint and as always the food and service were fantastic. From a 7 pm reservation we closed the place down and it seemed like only minutes.  Highly recommended and it is much closer to the Strip than the other Chain.  Definitely will return again next year.  K"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time, nothing really stood out. I asked for all the meats medium, yet there was no consistency. Some of the meats were well done, some were rare, which wouldn't have been a big deal if the flavor was exceptional, which it wasn't. I will say, the service was friendly but after we paid our bill, the waitress never came back to the table. I understand that's common practice these days, but when you're paying a $200 bill for 2 people, I expect a refill on my water. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Of all the Yelp promos I took advantage of during Yelp Spring Break, dinner at Fogo de Chão was the most memorable. This was my 1st time at Fogo de Chão or any Churrascaria, for that matter. I never knew what I was missing.  I made reservations, the girlfriend & I arrived on time, & we were promptly seated. Service was impeccable throughout. After we told the host that we were Churrascaria noobs, the manager personally came to our table & gave us the rundown.  In the most general terms, there are 3 food choices: some side dishes like cheese bread, mashed potatoes & polenta are automatically brought to the table; the salad bar; & the endless parade of meats brought directly to the table by the gauchos.  All of it is all-you-can-eat & all of it was outstanding. Most places with an all-you-can-eat salad bar stock that salad bar with lots of low cost filler. Not here. This Fogo de Chão salad bar had impressive Salmon & Charcuterie platters.  I made 1 visit to the salad bar & wanted to go back for more, but the meats the gauchos kept bringing were undeniable. That night, there were 16 varieties of beef, pork, lamb, chicken & sausage that were coming fresh out of the kitchen & being brought directly table-side.  It was a non-stop carnivore's carnal feeding frenzy of fleshly delights. So much meat. So good. So very good. Before coming to Vegas this time, I had decided this trip would be strictly \"no buffets.\" But it was too late now & there was no turning back.  Fogo de Chão is awesome. The whole Churrascaria concept is awesome. Yelp is awesome for the Yelp Spring Break promo offer that got me to try Fogo de Chão for the 1st time. Sadly, there's no Fogo de Chão near home for me. But if I'm ever near 1 again, I'll definitely go out of my way to go back for more."}
{"text":"Pricey, but well worth it! The meats are so delicious and perfectly cooked to your likings. Don't touch the salad bar until you try all the meats because there are about 8 different types and they're all scrumptious. The cooked bananas are also really good along with the mashed potatoes and polenta sides to clean your palate between meats. Also request a side of the chimichurri sauce, it goes great with every steak! Overall, I'd say the filet minion and lamb were my personal favorites. The service was also very good, the second you flip your card over they are there at your table with different meats. Definitely a unique experience that I would do over and over."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for our anniversary. I never ate so much in my life!! Definitely come hungry! My fav thing besides the meats are their rolls!!"}
{"text":"Good Brazilian Steakhouse, meats are same as Texas de Brazil, but it lacks quality in other areas. The salad bar is meh and I wish they had soups. The excuse for not having soups is that that's how original Fogo restaurant was, which I think is a BS excuse. If you are serving salads, meats, sides and dessert; then soups should be served to cater to varying customer needs.   We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was very delicious and refreshing. The meats were tasty, particular the leg of lamb. The sides and the bread with chimichurri sauce were very delicious.   Overall, its a very good location in terms of food and service. They need to add more items to the salad bar and they have a potential to be better than Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"When it comes to Brazilian Steak houses in the USA you get what you pay for...in the case of Fogo de Chao, you pay a lot. Having a Brazilian wife and having lived in Rio for two years, I feel I have a good idea of what it's all about.  While the salad bar is subpar...who the hell comes here for the salad anyway? It is the meat we seek and the meat was excellent, all the standard popular cuts, sirlon, fillett, skirt steak, pork, bacon wrapped fillet, chicken, sasuage...well you get my drift. All perfectly seasoned and with a side of the baked bananas in brown sugar.For dessert, stop at the first item on the menu, Crema de Papaya! OMG good!  The Manager came out to say hello, he is from Minas Gerias, and told us that they were opening two new stores, one near our home in San Francisco, the other in San Diego. Surely a special treat, but were better to treat yourselves than in Las Vegas?"}
{"text":"Delicious! This restaurant is worth every penny! The staff was great, food was awesome, pricey, but you definitely get your money's worth and get it back from all the different cuts of meat. The manager made his way around the dining hall and was super friendly. Casual dress and everything was great. I would highly recommend reservations since they open at 4:30 on Saturdays and it's already packed."}
{"text":"First trip here May 1, 2012. We were early, about 5:30pm. We walked right in and were seated with no wait.   Wait staff were professional and respectful. We asked questions and had all our confusion resolved quickly. After reading many of the reviews here on Yelp I was prepared for a different dining experience. I was pleasantly impressed.  The salad bar was a little un-impressive with a small-ish selection of veggies, cheese, meats, and dressings. I've been to a lot of salad bars in my life, this one was the nicest to look at but one of the poorest selections. I did not understand the concept of cold veggies normally served heated. Who serves cold cooked asparagus? This place does.  So the process is simple. Seating, order drinks, go to salad bar, and when ready flip your round coaster from red to green and the many meat serving men stop by with their steaks and other meats on steel rods to slice a serving after you specify your desired cook cut (medium rare to well). They give you tongs to grab the slice and pull it to your plate.  As long as your coaster sits green side up they keep coming every few minutes. Turn the coaster to red to halt the meat.  They seemed to come in waves with cooked meats to offer. I had the beef and declined the chicken and lamb. The meat guys were a bit on the quiet side so many of them I had to have them repeat which cut it was since I wanted to avoid lamb and pork.  The meats came fast and hot. We got filled-up quickly.   The service was excellent, dining room and salad bar was clean and beautiful. I would gladly return here. Probably not a place to go in jeans and a t-shirt. Our cost for two with tip was about $130, we don't consume alcohol or dessert.  Follow-up: Been here twice more. Always pretty much the same experience. If I could change a few things; offer a way to warm the veggies on the salad bar, and to spread out the gauchos because when they arrive one after another after another makes it hard to eat and talk and deal with them. Plus if there was a way to communicate that the lamb and chicken guys can stay away, just the beef only please. What about different shaped coasters, colored, to communicate things like beef only? Just a suggestion. Oh yes, and the meat servers could speak a tiny bit louder too, or maybe a sign on the meat skewer instead of their table side whisper?  Maybe next time I go back I'll bring my own BEEF ONLY sign!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a really nice dinner with outstanding service , I highly recommend this restaurant. I went to Texas de Brazil for my birthday in May then dined here for my best friend's birthday just about two weeks ago and I wish I chose Fogo de Chao over Texas de Brazil at Town Square. The quality of the meats here have really impressed me. At Texas de Brazil , the meats were so salty and got cold fast. Over here , it didn't get as cold fast. I could eat in a timely matter. Also , I did not have to down my water. Everything was perfectly marinated and seasoned. The top sirloin was my favorite since I really like my meat rare. Ask your server for the chimchurri sauce ! The meats didn't really need sauce to begin with but it adds a really nice flavor to it. Also loved the plantains which was kind of like caramelized bananas with brown sugar. I ate like ten of those lol. I must say the salad bar and dessert selection are a bit better at Texas de Brazil but you come here for the meat anyways. The meats were definitely worth the $$$. Service was very good - one of the best table side assistance. It really feels like a fine dining experience. Five stars :)  Tip - Sign up for their e-mail offers and get a 25$ off coupon (you can use up to two per table)."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. The Market Table and full Churrasco experience is wonderful. If possible, save room for dessert. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"The hubby and I came here for our anniversary dinner. All I can say is WOW. Everything from the salad bar, to the incredible meats and side dishes as well as the customer service were amazing! I was on meat over load and I loved it, don't know how people can be vegetarians lol. The service was impeccable, even the Manager (I'm assuming he was the Manager lol) Ricardo came over a couple of times to ensure that we were satisfied. If you are a meat person, you can't beat this. $52 for all the salad bar, meats and side dishes you want, definitely worth every penny!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"love it! the meat is great, the service is wonderful and the food is amazing! wait, i said it twice, well, the meat is awesome"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was a little lacking. The Groucho's were very good but our waiter didn't really pay attention to us."}
{"text":"Maybe because it was Valentine's Day night and it was busy... but unfortunately, I'd have to say this place is OVERRATED.  Good thing about this place is that the restaurant is located in a nice upscale area and is easily visible from the main road.  Fancy decor and high class environment.  People understand that it is upscale so for the most part everyone is dressed up.  Good ambiance for a romantic dinner.    For the food, you're paying $50 for each person for a salad bar and unlimited meat.  Now the food wasn't bad at all.  Everything at the salad bar tasted good and it was all fresh.  The meats portion really depends on how much of the different choices you like.  Being that it was my first time, I wanted to really experience what they had to offer and get a little bit of everything.  Problem with that... everything wasn't great.   I would have rather ordered a dish that i preferred and got full off that.  But instead i ate a mixture of things that liked and things that I don't really care to try again.  At the end of the day, none of the different cuts wow'ed me.    The reason I'm giving this such a bad review was the service.  Again, I'm sure it was because it was Valentine's Day but It was just horrible!  Servers come to tables with the different meat randomly and there were times where everyone had empty plates and it took a while for another server to come.  Also, some of the meat never came to our table so we had to ask for them towards the end of the meal.  At the end of the meal, they brought out our dessert twice and forgot the hot tea.  Different waiters were asking if we needed anything, but they would forget about it.  They just didn't seem organized.  Finally, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our bill.  They did apologize for it because their \"system was down.\"  Finally, we got a bill and noticed that the 2 beers we ordered and the dessert wasn't on there.  I thought that was a nice gesture to compensate for the wait.  However, a couple of minutes later another waiter comes and tells us that we received the wrong bill!  He then gives us the correct one with everything on it.  I'm not complaining that we had to pay for what we got, but that just made them look so bad.  Ultimately, if I make reservations at a restaurant, come dressed up, and I'm paying $50/person for a so-so meal, they better be on point when it comes to customer service.  Our servers knew that it was our first time there and they did nothing for us that would make us want to come back."}
{"text":"I went there last night with my wife and son, we ordered the steak and the Salad Bar, I would say the salad bar was really good and I enjoy it, as for the steak, it was just ok as the meat was not that tender, they tend to bring different type of meat quickly in the beginning and then they stop but occasionally waiters ask you if you need more, I asked for the fillet mignon since I did not get any and I was ignored even though they said they will bring me some. My wife said that the restroom room was not clean and the ambience was average. We did not order any drink and I ended paying $200 for three including $23 in tips so the price is expensive and in my opinion is not good value, I could have better experience for $66/person. Parking is ok and they offer valet if you are looking for one. Location is near the strip."}
{"text":"I don't know how to write this review, because after all, I did ask my boyfriend if we could just move into this restaurant. So obviously, I liked it. Most meats were on the well done side, and I felt rushed picking out a glass of wine. Service was impeccable, and the food we were offered that was actually cooked well and warm was delicious. I understand it's gotta be tough to temp something everyone would like. Lighting was off, in my opinion. Felt more like a cafeteria than and upscale(ish) restaurant.   I begged and begged to come here because I have been to similar restaurants that blew me away, and while I enjoyed myself, I don't see me going out of the way to come here again."}
{"text":"The food was out of this world.  Expensive, but well worth it.  The one thing I couldn't get past was the service.  It was extremely sub-par, especially for how the establishment attempts to present themselves (professional.)  I can't even count the number of times that our party of 6 had to be told repeatedly (i.e. at least 3 times on each occasion,) that the specific item we were asking for would be \"right out\"...or \"it was cooking, should be here any minute\"...or any other excuse they could deliver us at the time.  Not just the meat/entree's - no...we had to wait over 30 minutes just for BREAD.  There was no flow to our meal, it was haphazard at best.  I don't expect 100% organization in any establishment - especially one where there a a myriad of servers/specialties running around.  But my experience went far beyond reasonable in the opposite direction of organized chaos.  This was a complete service failure.  Not to be outdone in failures - it took almost 20 minutes (not an exaggeration,) JUST to get our check.  Since it was my first time at Fogo de Chao, I don't know if this was just a fluke or their are staffing issues (new) at the establishment, or both!  But for the expense and time involved in an outing to Fogo - I can't see myself being willing to risk it in the future.  Now, if you have all the time in the world (our meal went 3 hours and 20 minutes!) - then by all means, go enjoy the most awesome food you could ask for.  Just be ready to work for it."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for New Years Eve and it was AMAZING. the customer service is great and the servers were on top of everything. I highly recommend the filet mignon wrapped in bacon. Probably the best steak I've ever had. It is definitely on the pricey side but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This was our first time at a Brazilian steakhouse.  We LOVED it!   Minh was fabulous!   We went for an early dinner, which was a great idea.  We had the place to ourselves for quite a while.  The waiters doted on us, the meat was especially hot and fresh, and the dining area was quiet.  It was fun to watch it fill up a hot later.   The desserts were fantastic also.   We will be back."}
{"text":"The service was amazing!! The food was not my cup of tea. But kudos to the service and management staff."}
{"text":"Take my money, great tasting assorted meats in which you can choose to your liking of how well, wonderful must try experience!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Not as many spits as I am used to in NY but all was very good.  Hosts were all friendly especially Louis"}
{"text":"Don't eat all day so you can enjoy all the delectable meats. Their salad bar is nice for those who need something healthy on their plate."}
{"text":"Took my wife and friends out for a casual dinner.  Service was very nice.  Unfortunately,  I received food poisoning from here.  After taking to some friends I have found 2 more food poisoning victims from this exact resteraunt.  Please be careful.  I suspect it was the salad bar.  Everything was mildly warm (even cold dishes)."}
{"text":"We eat here pretty often and really enjoy it. Great for diners that are gluten free. Service & food is five star; see my \"gluten free options\" section for reason for the three star review.   For lunch you can do the market table (extensive salad bar w/ different meats, cheeses, fruits, veggies, etc.) for $15; you can add 8-10oz of various cuts of meat for $8-9 or so the whole experience for $32. So lots of options and great for everyone.   Service: Service is always great... one time a server did a mini wine tasting with three different Malbec wines for us to try before deciding on a glass. If you want a certain type of meat, don't be afraid to ask for it.   Food: The \"market table\" salad bar has a little bit of everything for everyone... lots of meats, cheeses, fruits, veggies of all sorts. The sides that come with the meats are excellent (my favorite is the Pão de quiejo --- naturally gluten free cheesy bread made with yuca flour!!) And, of course, there are the meats -- not much to say except they're all delicious. Rare lamb chops are my FAVORITE. If you're not big on really salty foods, I would suggest letting someone else take a piece of meat before you do so you don't get the brine... I never can eat an \"outside piece\" because it's much too salty for my taste but most people love that part the most.   Drinks: Good wine selection. Can't speak for anything else.   Gluten free options: all meats, all salad bar items that are actually on the salad bar EXCEPT SALAD DRESSING... not sure about the items that are on the second small table. I do just want to comment that although most servers are knowledgeable about the gluten free options, my server today was new and not sure so asked someone else and came back to tell us that \"everything except the bread is gluten free\"... I just wanted to double check and nope, the dressings are NOT... I remember reading something about it online so I looked and then asked another server just to see if something had changed since the post online and she came back and said that the dressings are not GF. This is the only reason that I am giving three stars because I eat GF due to a wheat allergy, not Celiac, so I could have had a minor reaction, however for somebody with Celiacs, this could have caused them to become severely ill. I understand that some places may not educate servers on the exact ingredients of things but if your menu says to ask about gluten free options, the servers should be well informed!! Before today, this would have been a five star review."}
{"text":"Just finished a delicious dinner. Great service from Jose. Even had a tour of the kitchen. Was a fun evening with friends. Was careful with the salad bar. The roasted garlic and pickled onions went great with the meat.  The lamb was my favorite the filet mignon not as tasty as the other cuts of beef."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I have dined at other Brazilian steak houses and wanted to check them out.  My impression - a bit underwhelming. They advertise 16 types of meat. Our table saw maybe 7. At the \"other\" restaurant we have to constantly turn away the servers. Here we had to look for them. The salad bar was half of the size of the competition's and to say the least - rather bland. The managers visited our table more than the servers. Appeared to be understaffed. Try the other one after visiting here and you may just agree with me.   At this price point you expect more and better than the others. I will return however- but only because the \"other\" competitor is not in my home town. They are still good - just not great."}
{"text":"I have been to the Vegas location. Scottsdale is the best of them. Service was the best of the two as well. The meat entrees in Scottsdale were better than Texas de Brazil in Vegas as well. Service was a bit better at Texas. The salad bar was not as elaborate as Texas either but still excellent. However, after all is said and done, the Scottsdale location was exceptional.  I will be back. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Is there something wrong with me and my entire party that dined here?  We were soooooo excited and thrilled about eating here. Well, quickly after tasting our first bite of meat, we realized we had basically just paid $50 for an all-you-can-eat salad bar and some disgustingly, overlooked and under seasoned meat. It didn't matter how you wanted your meat cooked, it was all the same. Medium-rare=cooked thoroughly??  Really?  Yuck. I could go on and on about our meat samples that all tasted like a boot, but won't bore you. To top our visit off, when asked how our meal was, we were honest. Our server told us he was sorry, but that we should have thought about it when we made out reservation for the busy time of night. Basically implying that quality goes down during that time. He told us the meat gets cooked and then sits on the grill/burner to stay hot all day. Yuck. What a HUGE disappointment, and not a cheap one at that."}
{"text":"It was a nice experience! Food is great- Meat lovers would enjoy it! I had the mango martini which was perfect! I didn't try any pork or chicken or sausage. My favorite was lamb and garlic sirloin."}
{"text":"WARNING: COME HUNGRY!  If you think you're hungry, come hungrier. You can get filled so fast due to all the delicious meats you may scarf down in the first 30 mins (trust me, personal experience).   My boyfriend and I got seated fairly quickly upon walking in with no reservation. Our server hastily explained the process of the coasters to my boyfriend (first-timer). Red means no more meat, green means come at me with them (not kidding, they practically swarm you; can't think of any other heaven).   We quickly scurried to the salad bar to choose the different sides for the meats we were about to devour. I loved the range of selection, healthy and non-healthy. The veggies tasted very fresh. They also offered different vinaigrettes, oil, and condiments for our sides. Being Asian, we had rice our first round to eat with our meats but quickly changed it to all veggies (we're clearly new to this).  Now onto the food itself: Can I please just first talk about the mashed potatoes that they brought out as a side. They were the FLUFFIEST clouds of heaven I've ever tasted in my near 23 years of life. They practically melted in my mouth. I was so taken aback by the potatoes I immediately placed half of it on my own plate. The cheeseballs deserve a shoutout too. The cheese wasn't prominent visually but definitely evident tastefully. They were SO airy, it was just delightful. I loved tearing it in pieces and looking at the insides. I felt like a child eating those wonderful cheese balls. My favorite meats were the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and the top sirloin. I liked that you can request particular meats and it will come out right away. I also like that they ask how you liked your meat cooked. Some meats came out a lot more rare than my requested medium rare, but it was still delicious.  The meat servers were pretty nice, some made jokes which was pleasant. The service speed can be a bit better. I had to ask a few times for my A1 sauce (I know I shouldn't ask for a sauce, but I can't resist A1 sauce no matter how good the meat is). We had to wait a bit for our cups to be refilled as well. This may be due to how busy they were so it's not a big deal.  All in all, this was a pleasant experience with a wonderful array of meats and vegetables to choose from. I will definitely be back to celebrate special occasions!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff was very pleasant and the food was awesomeness! !"}
{"text":"1st time visiting as part of Restaurant week. Group of 7-we were treated to outstanding service, delicious and fresh unlimited salads, veggies and other sides. Loved the table side plantains! Yummy. And of course the meat. Wow, once you turn over your card from red to green the gauchos begin rounding the table with pork, lamb, steak, chicken, and sausage. Wow. My favorite was the filet minion. As part of the price fixe service we were also treated to a free dessert. For meat lovers and low carb fanatics, this place is a must."}
{"text":"This place is the greatest steakhouse I have ever been. The service is prompt and the attendants are kind and more than willing to serve. They go out of their way to make your experience one to remember. The meats are incredible and the endless salad bar is phenomenal! I cannot explain how incredible this place is, if you want to experience what luxury is please spend the extra money and do it right."}
{"text":"Omg, the best place to put meat in your mouth! Almost every cut of meat that you can think of they have.  The meat feels as thought its melting in your mouth. The fillets, the chicken breast wraped in bacon, sirloin,  omg delicious!!!!! The beans and rice at salad bar, amazing. The salad bar and fruit are great as well. Try the cucumber mint drink. Creme brulee and chocolate molton cake to die for. I can't rave enough about this place. Also the entire staff was super friendly from the hostess,  bartender and waiters who were super funny as well.  Wonderful staff. We were there about almost 3 hours talking and eating and talking and they were always friendly.  I recommend this place for any family event and business."}
{"text":"I don't think the price worth what you get.  After a few times they stop coming with the goodies parts, like filet, picannia, and top sirloin.  The mashed potatoes wes extremely testy.   For dessert we ordered Flan, it Wes bad so we returned it.   Bootom line, I don't think thet I will return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is so good, but you get full so fast. Make sure to not eat the salad bar first. Try each type of meat that comes to your table. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service! The food is so tasty and the meat is perfectly cooked.The shift manager came by to reassure we had received all the meats and our experience was top notch! He realized it was our wedding anniversary and brought us out a dessert on the house! I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time. The bar had a great happy hour, and the restaurant had a fantabulous special for 40.00 each that had desert included. The service was spectacular, and the manager made sure to ask every table if they enjoyed there evening! This place is great, we will be back soon"}
{"text":"My husband and I came back here to redeem our \"Complimentary Father's Day Dinner\" gift card and things were even MORE exceptional this time!! I absolutely would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A good example of the US model of Brazilian-style BBQ with upscale pricing. The buffet has a moderate to good selection of cold dishes....including smoked salmon which was mostly ignored by the meat-atarian clientele.  Drinks are priced on the high side but many diners stayed with just water and/or non-alcoholic beverages.  Quality of meats very good- but that's what expected for the  $50 charge. My real concern was the speed of service and the quick paced ambiance- this would not be my choice for a long, relaxed evening out."}
{"text":"Always upscale Scottsdale dining with a beautiful environment, presentation, service, as well as beautiful people.  Impressive salad bar that has plenty of meats and cheeses as well as smoked salmon, prosciutto, candied bacon, plus soup, beans and tenderloin.  The grilled and marinated meats are mostly juicy and brought to your table that are sliced off the skewer.  Very filling and impressive, you can choose the salad bar or both."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing ! Perfect place to go if it's a very special occasion for groups of people . Let me first say the customer service was absolutely amazing the lady who served us was very patient and she explained every thing to us and constantly tended to us , and basically it's all you can eat for $50 a person and there was a salad bar. The salad bar basically has EVERYTHING from kale to beets to fruits to potatoes to everything ! I wish I utilized the salad bar more but I had to make room for all the meats !! Basically there's a red card with a green side on the other side and if you flip your card to green then all these guys holding different types of meats come to your table offering you different types of meat ! You can choose medium , medium rare or rare and they'll cut you a small slice and you just grab it with your mini tongs . Let me tell you this was so fun and it was so delicious trying all the different types of meat , I loved the sirloins and I loved the bacon meats and I just omg everything was so freaking good . And after so many meats I got really full but made room for a dessert and I got the strawberry cream and that was amazing . This place is totally worth the $50 I'm definitely coming back again but probably by myself because I loved it so much HAHA don't judge me ."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Staff very friendly. On time with everything. My boyfriend and I will defiantly come again!"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying the food was absolutely exceptional and our waitress was very attentive and friendly!   The only reason for the 4 stars is the service we received from the hosts. We had reservations for 730pm and they did not seat us until 810pm. They said they were running a bit behind and couldn't give us a time frame for when we would be seated. Which is fine, I get things happen. BUT there was no apology on their delay, they didn't check up on us while we waited 40 min. And I made sure to call that day to confirm our reservations. They made it seem like we were inconveniencing them.   But once we sat down the service completely changed! The waitress was sooooo great! And the food amazing!:) definitely reccomend."}
{"text":"I was too busy catching up with our team, and apologies for the only photo. But, I did save the best for last, desert.  :)  Their Tres Leches was also delicious.   Everything was amazing. Their tri tip was my favorite. Very juicy.  In the salad bar, I'm a big fan of quinoa and mango salad which were both good.  Service was great, red meat where coming out of my ears. Stuffed! The end.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I've been here twice already and definitely looking forward to the next time. My husband and I had the rodizio so we had anywhere from chicken to filet migon, and they were all great. There is also a salad bar I didn't get anything from there other than fruit and some soup. As for dessert we had the cheesecake and so far best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best value is at lunch. Lots to eat to the point of nitrate overload. Great salad bar, service. Always come back on every visit here."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch.... You would think it would be a little bit busier but it wasn't....Parking was easy breezy tho... So i didn't really mind it being slow....:) 2 thumbs up for that.   Now onto the service and the food.  Food was what u expected it to be. The guys walked around with different cuts of meat and it was pretty decent. But the kicker was that i was asking for medium to mid rare and they were giving me well done pieces at the beginning. Once i started to decline certain cuts and specify again and again i wanted some red in the center... They started giving me more of the \"pinker\" stuff. And then one of the guys started to explain to me in a not so friendly manner that medium and rare were two different things.... And i told him again.... Something in between medium and mid rare.... And he still didn't get it and have me a well done piece of meat.... So totally annoyed!!!  Meat (3/5.... 3 just because my last piece of meat i got there was perfect). The salad bar was their normal spread... Decent. (4/5) the cheesy puffs... Or whatever they are called...omg...i could've eaten just those and i would've been happy....lol (5/5)  Service... Was eh....i had to flag down people constantly. First they forgot my bf's coke.... Then the guys with meat were just passing us by even though my little card was on green! Then we had to flag down another person to get a refill on our water and cokes.... Then we had to flag down another person to get our checks... Are you getting my drift? Yeah there was alot of me craning my neck to try and capture people's eyes to get service. (1/5)  Then the kicker to the entire meal was that the manager basically lied to me. Before we were even seated...i asked about their \"summer feast\" which is a discounted price for lunch and dinner but you have to ask for it before you sit down... Which is what i did. The manager nodded his head and said they were running it. Well when the check came, the price was the full amount. So i mentioned it to the server and he took it away and said that he would ask the manager. The manager didn't even have the decency to stop by the table to explain it himself... The server had to explain and say that it is only for dinner. So if that is the case... Why did the manager nod and say yes at the beginning??? On top of all the craning to get people's attention and the lies at the end... Leaving here with a not so good taste in my mouth so hence the 2 stars....  Most likely if i do want fogo de chao again....i would definitely recommend passing on this location up for their other location summerlin.... Or maybe just going to Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"Let me say this; WOW! Not fast food pricing but VERY worth what you get in return. Great value. If you still have room after the \"preliminaries,\" the meats are fabulous and they keep on coming. Lamb, pork, chicken and about 10 different cuts and styles of beef all cut to order at your table by the gauchos. The service and atmosphere are excellent. Extensive drink menu.  Not for the faint, vegans or light eaters. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Love the salad bar!!! Fun place to hang and eat with friends!"}
{"text":"We went here for Thanksgiving tonight. Our reservation was for 5:30,normal dinner hour. They advertised turkey for their Thanksgiving menu. All out of turkey at 5:30? Are you kidding me? Then we thought we might as well eat the meats. Pathetic! Tough,overly salted,and just horrible. We will never return!"}
{"text":"It was our first visit here as we had no idea about it, but it came highly recommended as a place wec should go for or anniversary.  Reservations were very easy to make online, and even though we were almost a half hour early, because there were a lot of tables at that time, they graciously say us.  The service and attention was excellent and was a' pleasure to watch & experience.  The meats that came by was mind boggling and the food bar was pleasing to the eye & offered some very unique & tasty items.  The meat, though was fatty & all but the filet mignon was tough & some cuts tasteless.  Disappointing to be honest & for the price, I can't justify going back.  I was looking forward to the experience I was told about, but it didn't measure up."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao is probably one of the best restaurants I've been too. Obviously, its pretty upscale but definitely worth the money. The location couldn't be better. The food and service is amazing. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"The wife and i went there tonight, 12/19/2016. Had 6:30 reservations and seated right as we walked in. We took advantage of their military holiday special. This was our second visit to this location.    The food was great, table service was so-so.   The only down part of our visit was this. Tonight was cold out and they sat us next to the windows. The windows are single pane and let in alot of cold air. Plus we were seated near a side door which also let in alot of cold air. Almost half way through dinner the wife was cold.   Continued with dinner and it kept getting colder. Me, I'm dressed in a polo shirt and jeans and a bit chilled. The wife is now dressed in layers. One more thing, there's a vent right above our table.   The heat kicks in but someone left the a/c on. I got so cold i put on my jacket. We told one of the servers who went to double check this and assured us it was the heat. I'm bald and wanted so bad to put on my skull cap I was so cold. Never felt the heat what so ever.   Morale of this story is if you visit in the winter stsy away from the window seats."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I seek it out in every city I travel to. Food is always good and consistently delicious. This particular location was easy to find with plenty of parking. Ambience was pleasant. Service was great. All good."}
{"text":"This was not our first rodizio - or even our first visit to a restaurant in this chain. It is however, our first time at this location. The food was outstanding as was the service. When visiting Las Vegas, we will come back."}
{"text":"I have been to other Churrascaria's, and I have to say... I was very impressed with Fogo.  Their market table was impressive.  A wonderful, fresh assortment of cheeses, charcuteries, soup, and other side items that I truly enjoyed.  If I didn't want to try the different meats so badly, I could have lived off of the buffet table...and still went home happy!  The different meat selections were wonderful.  None of them disappointed in any way, and were PHENOMENAL.  The service:  phenomenal.  They were super attentive, polite, and made you feel special.  I have to say even the Gaucho's bringing over the wonderful meats did more than just \"politely bring you food\".  They engaged in conversation, and really made the experience that much better.  Thumbs up to the staff at the Fogo Pittsburgh location."}
{"text":"The meats are delicious , especially the filet mignon it was sooooooo freaking tender . I wouldn't entirely skip the other meat but do try a small portion and eat what you like the best. If u don't see a meat u want ask the waiter , they'll go n get it for u but does take a. Bit like 15 min . I would go for the experience not really the food because I can just go order a filet mignon at a restaurant and won't have to wait as long lol"}
{"text":"Went back recently and have to say their meats were very good.  I can't get enough of their picanha.  It's heavenly."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to dine in at a Brazilian steakhouse, and I'm glad this was my first. $50 all you can eat per person. Very reasonable price and you can easily eat your money's worth. You can start off at a salad bar which is pretty good. I loved the smoked salmon, bacon, and charcuterie. Next was the system of red and green signals. They give each person a two sided placard. If flipped on green, meat carvers walking around will know you want some. If red, they will not bother your dining. All the meats were so wonderfully seasoned and grilled. My favorite was the bottom sirloin and the bacon-wrapped filet mignon. Also, the caramelized bananas with condensed milk was absolute mind-blowing!"}
{"text":"Just from a vegetarian perspective. They do have a salad bar if you happen to be with a bunch of people who need to eat meat. The salad bar here is probably just as good as any buffet in Vegas. Not that impressive. I have been to a place similar to this in San Jose that had a fantastic salad bar this one, meh. Rice dry and over salty potato salad that was probably purchased from a grocery store pre packaged section.  I will state the apple salad and cheese was good.  Also my meat eating friends were distressed to find out grilled pineapple wasn't a choice. Once again, the Brazilian meat place that we went to in San Jose had it. Also my meat eating friends were sad that the lamb was too salty. When manager was asked she stated that grilled pineapple wasn't authentic. But their dessert menu included NY cheese cake and flan. Some pretty 'authentic' choices eh?  Also note the coffee is good."}
{"text":"Chose this place instead of the usual Vegas Prime Rib buffet. We were in the area so we decided to try it.  We went on a monday night, the place was pretty empty. Only 3 other tables were filled.   I must say, the service was excellent.  My plates were constantly cleared and drinks filled.  And the meat, when they came, they came in quick succession ( the waiter said because the place was pretty empty).  There was rib eye, flank steak, chicken wrapped in bacon, parmesan pork, beef ribs, pork ribs, lamb leg, lamb chop...I'm sure there were more, but those are the ones I remember.  I had tapped out and switched my indicator to RED long before the last cut was brought out. The meat was hit or miss, my favorites were the lamb leg, beef rib, and parmesan pork."}
{"text":"This is a good place to with a group of people as they have a good salad bar, full bar, and the ability to setup large tables to accommodate a big party. You will have no excuse if you said you are going home hungry. The salad bar is fantastic, the service is on par. The prices are what one would expect as this is more of a buffet style establishment. The ambience is upbeat and noisy.  The last few times I have noticed quality control is starting to diminish. Almost all of the meat contained chunks of fat or pieces of cartilage. Thought we may have went on a bad night but it was the same story the next couple times we went. The food is still good you just have to work a little harder on your cut of meat."}
{"text":"If you have never been to a Brazilian BBQ place you will probably love Fogo. For the purpose of this review I am comparing the Las Vegas Fogo to other Brazilian BBQ places and in that regard it falls a little short. I have been to Fogo in Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles as well as several other similar restaurants (Chima, Via Brazil, Texas de Brazil etc).   I will say this- I have been about four times and it is definitely improving- the worst visit was my first. During that visit service was very bad (compared to other Fogos) , there was an odd smell in the entire restaurant, and the sides all arrived cold each time. The meat service was sporadic both in terms of availability and quality.  When I go to Fogo here is what I want- I want nothing but outside pieces with a nice crust, I want the meat to be sliced nice and thin and I don't want to get 10 meats all at once and then nothing for a 15 minute stretch. At this Fogo there were big gaps between the meats, the slicing was done rather clumsily, and some of the meat hadn't been cooked properly so there was no crust. Some of the Gauchos also would keep circulating the meats after the outside pieces had all been cut off which is a big no no in my book.   The times I have been back since then the quality has definitely improved. If you cut out that first visit my rating would be 4 stars instead of 3. I have been for lunch and dinner and I think the dinner service is better- they seem to have more people working and the meat is generally better prepared."}
{"text":"Do not...I repeat...do not eat anything the day you come here. You will need the stomach space. Hostesses were not very helpful when we arrived 15 min early and provided no instruction as to when/where to wait. We told them we would be at the bar next to the desk and they said they would get us when our table was ready. They forgot about us.   After going back to the desk for a third time, we were finally shown to our seat. If you are seated next to the wall like us, it will feel like you are in Mario Kart, dodging meat servers, waiters, chairs, and people getting up for salad. We enjoyed several of the Signature Caipirinhas, which are tangy, sweet and refreshing.   The salad bar had some really unique options and don't forget to visit the hot bar next to salad for items to accompany your meats galore. They will give you a few sides table side, including polenta (yum!) and mashed potatoes and a fries banana dessert. We appreciated the little card to signal when you want more meat or when you need a breather (and elastic pants).   As for the meats, we were overwhelmed by beef that all seemed the same. Even as beef lovers, we tended to prefer the pork, chicken (the one on the bone) and sausages. While many mention the high price, the amount of food (and expensive meats) constantly offered to your table is worth it. A bit chaotic and I doubt we will go back but a unique and fun experience to have at least once."}
{"text":"Went with friends for a birthday and just wasn't impressed.  One of our party had been before, and loved the place.  My BF and I were just didn't think it was worth the $$.  Neither of us ate that much from the skewers, as it just didn't seem to have a lot of flavor.  When it was all said and done, we paid too much (drinks way overpriced) and left feeling unsatisfied.    I found it irritating that no one in party had their indicator turned to green at the same time, so we constantly had servers at our table which interrupted our conversations and left me feeling crowded.  For that price, we would have preferred having a good steak at Gallagher's or Twin Creeks.  Two people had the meals, dessert, one soda and two cocktails, with tip the bill was $192."}
{"text":"Always an absolute delight coming here. The garlic steak and bacon wrapped filet is a must have. Glad they got back the Guarana an absolute must try. And something about the bacon at the salad bar is just so good.  Wanna give a shout out to Lou and Christopher for being awesome waiters really made the experience that much better."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and our experience was amazing. The service, the food and our overall experience was wonderful. We came in for the for the summer special and definitely worth it and we will be coming back for the regular menu as well."}
{"text":"This place is pretty epic.   As you walk in, it looks nice and clean. You get seated and they start you off with drinks. They bring you bread, fried cheese (?), fried bananas, and garlic mashed potatoes. Then you go to the salad bar for salads, lunch meats, cheese, veggies, etc.   You sit down and they start bringing you all kinds of meat. Lamb, beef, pork, and chicken. And, it's not just any beef, either. It's the good stuff like filet mignon and flank and sirloin. Suggestion: just ask for the bacon wrapped filet mignon right off the bat. It's the most succulent piece of heaven I've ever had. Skip the rest ;)   The food is neverending! Jk it ends when you can't eat anymore. I ate until my heart was beating outside my chest. That isn't even an exaggeration. You'll understand if you ever go there.   Price? Pricy. I went at 930pm and paid 49.50 for the entire experience.   What I learned: 1. Don't go in jeans. Wear lose clothing.                       STRETCHY PANTS NEVER FELT SO GOOD BEFORE.  2. Don't load up on so many carbs.  3. Go straight to the bacon wrapped filet mignon. 4. Show up earlier to make more eating and digesting time.   Why did I give it 4 stars for what sounds like an amazing experience? I didn't like some of the stuff like the chicken and some of the beef.   THE END. (Bows, rolls away, then falls asleep)"}
{"text":"After a wonderful experience with this chain in San Antonio, my husband and I decided this would be the place to host my in-laws 50th Anniversary family celebration. The ease of making the reservations online lead me to believe that the evening would be a smooth and enjoyable.   Unfortunately that evening my husband was held up at work and we were about an half an hour later than our reservation. The host at the restaurant did a wonderful job seating our party and starting the meal as we had texted the family explaining our situation. Even upon our arrival, the servers were very helpful in getting my husband and me seated. As the meats were circulated to our table my husband and I had to continually catch the servers attention. Being a slightly larger party of eight, I did not think that was a number that would allow members to be overlooked. After about 45 minutes it seems the font of house manager noticed our issue and was very helpful sending servers to us and even asking if we were waiting for something particular.  But due to our later arrival as the rest of our party were enjoying conversation and the market bar, the meat stopped arriving along with all servers. They all seemed to have migrated to a different portion of the restaurant.   The other issue I had with the evening was that all the meat except the steak was very dry and over cooked. As our reservation was at 6pm, I can't imagine this was because the meat had cooked too long during service. It was a Thursday evening with I'm sure slower traffic than a weekend, but I would have thought the kitchen would be aware of how many reservations and on average how much of which dishes move during an evening and would adjust accordingly. Sadly to say that does not seem to be the case as chicken, pork, and even sausage were all dry and over cooked.   The bottom line is that I left an all you can eat restaurant hungry. Next time I am looking for a Brazilian dinning experience I will try a locally owned establishment."}
{"text":"Great service and it was a very quiet Thursday night. Celebrating our anniversary. The restaurant looked very appealing, clean and decor was delightful. The salad bar was everything g you could want. I loved the basil dressing on the fresh vegetables. The proteins were good size portions after they had sliced it for you and served on your plate. The variety of grilled items were fabulous and the seasoning was just right. The sirloin and the rib eye were my favorites. Great place to get full on special occasions. Recommend!!!  JM"}
{"text":"So damn delicious!!!!!!!! Very nice place to have a good dinner at. Looks great inside and the staff is very organized. Everyone was very polite and attended you immediately. Never waiting too long for new meats to come to our table. Although my husband and I ate waaaaaay too much, it was an amazing experience overall (:"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and the meat quality was excellent.  But the restaurant had a dirty wet sponge smell to it.  Plenty of meat and sides to go around.  The salad bar was ok."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and thought to give this place a try. The service is fast and the place had a great atmosphere. We were seated promptly although we did not have a reservation for a Saturday night. The server was very helpful and made sure we are doing good and have what we want. The meats were delicious and we were getting service faster than we could finish what we just cut. I docked a star because of the salad bar. It did not have enough variety and the mushrooms were pickled just too much:( I LOVE mushrooms and I was looking forward for that in the salad bar and also it was missing dried tomatoes and basil. Maybe I just got use to the Brazilian place in San Diego but it was good overall !"}
{"text":"This review may be a little inside baseball for some of you but I hate you anyway. This review will be only comparing this Fogo to other Fogos because if you don't already know that Fogo is awesome at this stage in your life you are a lost cause.   1. Service- our main waiter was a little clueless (he was white not Brazilian and had no idea how to pronounce anything, rookie mistake) but the Gauchos were very good. The 2nd meat to come around was Picanha but all the outside pieces had been taken. I told him I would wait, and he winked at me knowingly. From then on he brought EVERY Picanha over to our table first so I could have an outside piece. This kind of watering is worthy of a Nobel Prize. Overall the meat flowed continuously, drinks were refilled (although the water is garbage, def spring for bottled/sparkling as Summerlin water is borderline Waco water) and sides were brought out continuously.   2. Food- Most things measured up pretty good, here are the things that didn't quite meet top of the line fogo standards   Pao de queijo -these are the cheesy poofs. They were very thick and dense, not large and airy which is how i prefer them- they clearly need to work this out as whoever is making them is out of it  Bottom Sirloin- this was a little light on salt for my tastes. The whole point of this meet is salt  Beef Rib- I didn't see anyone else ask for this, and they don't bring it out unless you ask. As a result I think it had been sitting in there a while too long and was therefore kind of dry  Picanha- pretty good, but some pieces the fat was still very white/not cooked  Limeade- not quite nailing these. Don't get me wrong, still quite good, but they are not as creamy/frothy as a well established fogo, and some of them had very little lime taste ( I say some as I drank like 40 of these)  They also didn't seem to have Filet, or non garlic ribeye- but it was lunch so who knows   Overall: This is better than the strip fogo for sure, not quite as good as the best fogos I have ever been to, but its 2 miles from my house so I will prob be eating there every other day."}
{"text":"Welcome to meat heaven. If you don't like meat, stay away, you will probably faint just walking by their large, glass room of ribs just roasting tenderly.... begging you to come in and take a bite...  Whatever you do, don't eat the salad buffet first. You will get full off of the gigantic vegetables (asparagus the side of a baby's arm, I'm not even joking), and not have any room for the variety of meats these Aladdin-pant-wearing, sword-holding employees have in store for you.   Waiter immediately explains to us that there is no menu. \"Wha?\" I say. He basically explains that they come around with the chunks of meat on swords and will place as much as you'd like on your plate. It will include steak, chicken, lamb, etc. etc. The coaster on the table is red on one side, green on the other. If you are ready to eat, flip the card to green! When you want a red, don't forget to flip to red or else the men will just keep coming by to offer more meat!  Very spacious place, lots of attentive people waiting on you.  I got a little intimidated at first with all the swords flying by my head, but their 'Brazilian national drink' calmed me down. It tasted like a margarita with hints of vodka.  The whole time that we're eating I'm wondering how much this is gonna cost, I'm thinking it's gonna be super expensive since it's so good and there is no limit to how much to eat! It came out to about $30/person. Not bad at all! Come with your starving stomach, because there will be plenty to try out and it is so delicious!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday, we were both blown away about how delicious the food was. The salad bar was amazing as well. Everything packed a different and interesting flavor. Totally worth the money.   Also, the staff was on top of their game. Anyone and everyone their was willing to make sure you had the best experience.   Amazing."}
{"text":"Holy moly.  I had lunch there today.  I'm still full.  Guys dressed as gauchos come around with skewers of beef chicken and sausage... Oh and lamb.   It's a carnivorous delight. Basically all you can eat for 26 dollars so if you go, go hungry and plan to pace yourself and stay awhile. Atmosphere and service were good, dark woods, tall ceilings, crisp white linens.  Friendly and inviting staff works as a team in the table service. The gaucho outfits gave me a chuckle but to each their own the beef is good the lamb was superb and there is a salad bar ( that is also all you can handle at lunch) which was well stocked and included three different types of cheese.   No draft beer, but I did try the Brazilian black beer and it was tasty. Enjoy.   If you are a carnivore or omnivore and you like yourself... Eat here once before you shrug off this mortal coil... Or however Shakespeare said that.  ( always was better at math than English)"}
{"text":"After experiencing a couple of other Brazilian steakhouses I am happy that we chose to come here. The team lead by Minh provided us superior service. The food was amazing. We enjoyed everything as option after option was brought table side. The flank steak took the first place spot in my heart. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Meat lovers paradise.  Staff are incredibly friendly.  All the meats served were cooked to perfection.  Yummy, yummy    One last thought, the Brazilian Limeade.....delish."}
{"text":"I'm a long-time fan of Fogo. I've tried several other Brazilian steak houses and Fogo stands out as the best. Today was my first time at the Summerlin location, and it did not disappoint. All of the staff seemed especially attentive, and Cameron stood out most of all. I was enjoying a solo birthday lunch and he made sure it was still an occasion. The meats are why I keep returning to Fogo, and there is always more great meat than I can manage!  The side dishes are stellar as well."}
{"text":"$28 for lunch, superb food. Top Sirloin and Picania are my favorites. Come hungry, pace yourself, skip the meal prior to ensure you can engorge.  Nice staff, good salads. Convenient to strip"}
{"text":"Great place! I took my daughter & 10 family members here for her birthday and everyone loved it! The food was incredible & the concept is super original & really fun. The staff were friendly & helped us with a birthday surprise and brought out my daughter a birthday cake we had gotten for her. Couldn't have been more pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"Service here is better than the Beverly Hills location.  Had family visiting from out of town and decided to treat them to some Brazilian BBQ.  Service is impeccable.  Meats are a hit or miss depending on the cut, super disappointing considering the price.  As soon as I flipped my disc to green I was swarmed with meat in under 15 seconds.  Dress to impress.  $45 corkage fee.  Total bill came out to be a little more than $600.  Ouch!"}
{"text":"Came here this evening for my birthday and it was a great experience and yummy. I have been here a couple times before during AZ Restaurant Week and it has never let me down. Came with some people who had never been so it was a new and exciting experience for them. Our waiter, Brian was very attentive and made sure we had drinks flowing and the cuts of meat we wanted brought around. We opted for the full experience. The salad bar is always a good starter, but go light on it as to not fill up. The veggies are fresh and the array of toppings and dressings are good. I love the smoked salmon and deli meat and cheese selection as well. The salad bar also offers rice and soup which is a nice addition to the meal. And those cheesy bread puffs are so delicious. Sides of mashed potatoes and fried bananas are also refillable. I almost fill up on those alone but have to stop myself. Pro Tip, just flip your card green and leave it green so the meat is always flowing to you and just say no if you don't want the particular cut that comes by and wait until they bring around the filet and ribeye (or cut of your choice). You can also ask the waiter for a particular cut to come by and they'll get it sent over. If you come on your birthday as I did, it comes with a free dessert, also sign up for their email list and put in your birthday and you'll get a $25 off coupon for the full experience. The full dinner experience is well worth the $50 price, but even if you come for lunch, it's $25 (doesn't come with some of the prime cuts of meat) but still worth it. It's definitely a fun experience if you haven't tried it and love meat."}
{"text":"Oh man. This place was absolutely worth the $$$. I can't even begin to explain how delicious the meat was. All I can say is \"My taste buds were in heaven!!!\" Kids eat free I am not sure until what age but I know my 4 and 6 year old were free. If your visiting Vegas and want to go to Fogo De Chão do yourself a favor and go to the location in Summerlin. I have been to the location near the strip I thought it was good but they seemed more like a tourist location to get you in and out the quality of food isn't that good. The Summerlin Las Vegas location is set on quality and that makes a difference along with the friendly staff. Just check it out it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"This review is for Las Vegas location.  This place is great! Big salad bar with dry meats too!  The fire cooked meets were excellent ....different steaks ..garlic sirloin , filet mignon ,etc sausage, chicken , pork ribs ... wonderful!   The server suggested a cocktail called Cabannas --- like a lime and mint mojito ! Excellent , refreshing...  The staff gave great service!   I don't think I could have ask for anything more...  I should have come with a empty stomach ... because I really wanted to eat more!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable the amount of amazing meats you get to choose from. Went for a bachelor party and everyone left full and happy"}
{"text":"This place is great. It has AYCE salad bar with many nice cuts of deli meat, cheese, condiments, fruit, etc. I could come and just eat at the salad bar and leave happy.   The meats are great quality. They start to taste the same after a while but it is still good! I'm a huge fan of their lamb and chimichurri sauce. A must try! And you can't go wrong with any of their beef selections :)  Wednesdays have half off wine bottles which are a really good deal.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  My MAIN gripe with Fogo is the fact that they charged us for a birthday cake that we didn't order. My girlfriend used her $25 gift card that she received from Fogo for her birthday which they assumed meant we wanted cake? Then they even charged us for the cake that we didn't order? It's borderline fraud to be charging a customer for something they DIDN'T ask for. If you want to give us cake because it's our birthday celebration, it should be on the house. Don't just put it on our tab and charge us!! I am giving Fogo a bad rating because they were underhanded by doing that. I am willing to change my rating if they correct this."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been twice and had nothing but the best time. Great food each time and we left stuffed. Great salad bar along with the meats."}
{"text":"Great place to eat friendly staff  lots of meat cooked to perfection,  clean, so much better than pampas."}
{"text":"Love their cheese bread! Meat is as great as usual. Like what do you expect me to say yelp? They are unlimited grilled steaks with perfect seasoning. Well they did have a large party when I was there so service was a bit slow, had to stop somebody passing by when I needed stuff. The flan was not as delicious as I thought it would be..pretty plain with overwhelming caramel sauce"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were here tonight for a grand and glorious breaking of his diet. He had been before to the one in Houston, and had been looking forward to the new Scottsdale location. For being open only 3 nights, the service went quite smoothly and the staff and management we met were all great. We started out with drinks- a gin and tonic ($10) and a caipirinha ($8.25)- both were strong and very good. The wine list is extensive, for those who prefer the vino. Delicious little popovers arrived at the table, and we headed off to the salad bar. Far better and fresher than Fogo E Brasa's, it had a variety of cheeses (including chunks of parm and fresh mozzarella), smoked salmon, prosciutto, salami, sun dried tomatoes, olives, marinated bell peppers, asparagus spears, mushroom caps, and seafood and chicken salads, just to name about a third of the offerings.  Then came a veritable torrent of meat. The beef was the best, and came in a variety of cuts and preparations. We liked the Ancho (rib eye), the Picanha (the classic sirloin cut in the half moon shape), and the garlic beef best. The pork ribs were really well done and juicy, and the sausage was quite flavorful. The chicken was a tad dry, and the lamb was too gamey for our liking (and we usually like lamb).   Side dishes were brought to our table, in appropriately modest portions. There were squares of polenta, which I really liked but Hubby did not care for, and mildly garlic mashed potatoes, and yummy fried plantains.   Dessert choices were pretty typical: a creme brulee, a flan, 2 types of cheesecake, and 2 types of chocolate cake. Hubby wanted what he had enjoyed at the Houston Fogo before: the papaya cream topped with creme de cassis liqueur ($8.25). It was more runny than mousse-y, and the papaya taste was pretty subtle, with the liqueur being the top note.  There is a rather unnecessary valet parking service for $3, when the parking lot surrounding the place is huge. Not so huge, however,  that the many douche-bags who double parked went unnoticed. The bathrooms are nice. The dinner, which is all you care to eat, is $42.50 per person. I'm sure we'll be back for special occasions."}
{"text":"Protein. Sodium. More Protein. More Sodium. More and more protein. And some more sodium...  But this is all after you enjoy their salad bar which they hope you fill up on first, prior to eating lots and lots of their very expensive protein served on very large vertical 3 prong forks loaded with lots of sodium, served and cut tableside to the temperature of your liking.  I've done all dem chain churrascarias and Fogo ranks near the top as far as the large chains go. Their selection seems to be consistently larger than the others and their protein to me upon various visits around the 48, is less sodium-er.   Their salad bar has a larger selection of seafood cocktails, cheeses, antipasti, and crudites to keep the veggie folks happy.  They get a solid 4 Yelps for consistency and being less sodiumey than the rest of the chains...  But as far as Churrascarias go, Plataforma in Manhattan has my heart. MMMMmmmmm their chicken hearts...yes!  THIS has been a review by Gaurav"}
{"text":"Showed up five minutes after we called. Refused to seat us. Please get competent staff. We wasted our gas."}
{"text":"We were there yesterday for dinner and let's just say it was an ok restaurant. Let me start with the salad bar, there was a small collection unlike the Brazilian restaurant we visited in Chicago (Texas de Brazil), as for the meat, the service were fast but the meat collection was small as well and test wise it was ok. For $50 meal I would prefer to go to a different restaurant with better quality and that what we are going to do next time."}
{"text":"Friends took us there last night and all of us left fairly annoyed.  Admittedly it was very crowded but at $75 - $100 (after tax, tip, etc.) a person, they should be able to staff accordingly.  They sat our group of 8 in a back corner.  It looked like some sort of conference room as there was a projection screen above our head.   We sat and ordered drinks fairly quickly and then were directed to the salad bar to get started.  The salad bar was decent, however, the grilled vegetables were either overcooked and mushy or not cooked long enough.   The other items were more than decent...in all fairness.   Now for the meat.   They give you these little table markers which indicate to the servers when you are ready to try the meat selections.   It started off with a vengeance of servers coming to us to offer their wares.  However, after the first wave and only having tried a few items of what the restaurant offers - no one came.  We kept having to ask over and over to send someone with the other items and we kept getting the same meats offered to us.  So needless to say there were huge gaps in between our meal, all of the sides got cold, we had to ask for water a few times, no one came to check our bread...Coffee refill took over 10 minutes.   We were forced to leave a $70 tip due to policy but really we were borderline outraged.  Our poor friends that brought us were so embarrassed and angry.  It was a special occasion.  Living in this area - we have hundreds of fine dining choices.  Next time, we will try one of the others.   By the way, the meats themselves were hit and miss.  Some were over salty, some fatty, some over-charred, some perfect.  Ambiance is very nice though.  $500 tab - not worth it.  C.L. Gilbert, AZ"}
{"text":"This is a great place for any occasion.......First you need to prepare three days before......you will absolutely be rolled out of here from all of the food.....they offer many types of beef.....rare, medium rare and rare.....the staff is constantly coming to your table with filet, sirloin etc.....this is a meat lovers paradise........"}
{"text":"Great experience! I ate here with my family for the first time yesterday, & must say I was impressed. Everything was perfect, from the food to the service. Our server, Norma was awesome! She was very friendly, personal, & informative. As a local business owner, she exuded all the qualities I look for when hiring  employees to represent my business. When we told her it was our first time there, she went out of her way to ensure our visit was a memorable one. She went into great detail on how the food was prepared, & gave suggestions on trying certain food, that I probably wouldn't have tried, prior to her instruction. She came back frequently to check on us, & made sure our drinks were constantly topped off! The food was beyond delicious, & the guys carving the meat were friendly, & respectful. I would give 6 stars, but since that's not an option, 5 stars will suffice. Definitely recommend this restaurant, & will return!"}
{"text":"Was in vegas for sema 2weeks ago and on our first night came here. Its very nice place, the food was amazing! I love Brazilian bbq so to come here was just amazing how great the food was and the selection of meats they had, not to mention the buffet as well. Such tasty sides!! Very fresh!. I ate so much I was so stuffed but one happy stuffed woman. I will be back here when I'm in town again. One more thing to add. The service was top notch even being how packed it was during dinner. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Good but we waited a long time to be seated and there were open tables. Hostess was making excuses and said that we couldn't sit at the open table for another 20 minutes"}
{"text":"Good service, the meats were great. Came luckily on restaurant week! Score.  Pork ribs were on the spot and the winner tonight.  Beef ribs not as good as Beverly Hills.  The rest of the meats were a blur........."}
{"text":"If you like meat, this is the place to go!  Constant samples of all kinds of cuts from beef flank steak, ribeye, Filet Mignon, sirloin, lamb, pork, sausage, chicken, and so much more.  You also can grab a plate at the side/salad bar.  I didn't find the sides/salads to be anything but average.  The choices of meat and variety of flavors should satisfy any meat lover though.  We had a fabulous server as well as the bus people."}
{"text":"OH WHAT A MEAL!!!!!  I've been to Fogo before in Philly and this one was just as good. I called beforehand and asked for directions, they told me \"it's right off the strip\". Silly me being an east coaster I decided to walk! *Admiral Akbar voice* it's a trap!!! Seriously, it's like half a mile and past some serious ghetto! So take a car/cab!  From the time you walk in you're greeted and seated. We had the best server on the planet, and the food, oh the food! Cuts of meat at your prepared temp and oh so flavorful. Let me say that this is NOT for everyone. Vegetarians and vegans will cry and if you have a girl who'd only order a salad your money would be wasted. You need to bring some serious carnivores. The meat and salad bar are all you can eat, but take it easy there, it'll take up valuable room from the meat *drooling just thinking about it*  Make sure you hit up fog while in Vegas, it's definitely worth the (taxi) trip"}
{"text":"Greatest service,greatest foods ! You can have several different types of slice of  steak with entertaining!  Their salad bars have all kind of vegetables,sauces and soups. I went to this place on my birthday and they surprised me with another great services Always happy after visit this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in town right now. Maybe not the best but right now it is my favorite because of the amount and quality of food you get for the price. They also have an amazing wine selection. The service is great and I don't know if it gets any better as far as a meat selection! Love this place. The Beef ribs are by far my favorite!"}
{"text":"I love me some Fogo. Pro tip: go during lunch - all the same food for a cheaper amount. And, of course, another pro tip: be sure to go hungry! The staff are typically friendly and attentive (albeit less so on my most recent visit). The cocktails are yum. The wine list is fairly extensive. The salad bar is decent. The sides are alright. The meats, duh, are the star of the show. So much yummy meat goodness! Tip: be sure to ask for the sauces - mint jelly, chimichurri, and horseradish."}
{"text":"Not only is this a magical meat adventure, now you can partake for a weekday lunch . . . incredible!! I have been several times now and the food is always delicious and the service is always fabulous! I always look for a reason to make the drive to Fogo!"}
{"text":"Best and ONLY Brazilian restaurant in Phoenix, AZ. This is the best of the best. I'm a Brazilian so I KNOW what I'm talking about.   If you like and understand Brazilian food. This is the place to try. If you never tried Brazilian food, this will be different and something you should explore. It's a buffet style restaurant. Not my favorite type of restaurant but for Brazilian food, it's perfect.  This place is great for large groups. Lot's of fun! It can be nice for a couple too but you just have more fun in a group.   Don't even waste time, money on another Brazilian steak house other this one.    The service is always great. We come here every other month and we enjoy it a lot. There are several little things that I could find fault on but nothing major. I just wish it was a bit cheaper so we could come more often. I think a $25 per person on weekdays and Saturdays would keep this place super busy.   Anyways, it's worth it.  I really wish they would have Saturday and Sunday lunch!!! The vegetables, the salads, the entire salad bar is very fresh, authentic and everything looks good. The salads are very tasty. They offer hot side dishes once you turn your card green. The deserts are very good too. However, I like to get my cannoli fix at Pomo Pizzeria across Fogo for desert.   The food really does look appetizing. The  beans could be better though, that's my only complain. Also, I wish they had refills on soda, since they are so expensive. My favorite drink is the lemonade, I love it! They offer refils for the lemonade! However, $5 is a bit too much for a lemonade, $3 would have been reasonably priced.  Kids under 9, I think don't pay. It's great for kids and very healthy food. My son has Celiac Disease and he can eat lots of items here. He loves the polenta and cheese bread. We have eaten here many times and my son never ever got sick or cross contaminated. Lots of dairy free options as well. A good place for allergy folks!   Love the meat! I'm hungry now...."}
{"text":"I have been to four such places in the Phoenix area and if you combine food and ambience this is the best by a mile.  The service was exceptional--we didn't have to wait for anything and people were coming by constantly not only to serve us a gajillion types of meat, but to check on our every need.  Refills?  Sauces?  A particular cut you'd like?  Anything and everything was available right away.  We got taken on a tour of the kitchen and it is huge and spotless.  There is also a private room which apparently is first-come-first-served and is no additional charge.  There is a salad bar with chilled asparagus, hearts of palm, and the most ridiculous artichoke hearts--literally just the very best part of the artichoke here.  There was a delicious chicken salad, potato salad, a bunch of cheeses, and cold cuts.  But of course, the main event was the meat--sausage, sirloin, leg of lamb, chicken legs, bacon wrapped chicken breast, bacon wrapped filet... and the best cut of filet mignon that I've had in a long time.  Tender, amazing, delightful.  This place also gets extra kudos for the fact that the servers ask as they are cutting the meat which doneness you want, which is nice.  I really enjoyed it.  Finally--the dessert was sublime.  Between the three of us, we shared the papaya-ice cream-black currant liqueur thingy, which wasn't too sweet but wonderfully subtle; the molten chocolate cake which would be the most perfect desert known to humanity if it had a few more fresh berries on there, and a wonderful creme brulee which capped off my birthday in the best possible way.  Gabi was evasive when I asked if it was her who ratted me out and scored me a free birthday dessert but I will go ahead and give her the credit since she's just so all-around exceptional.  Once again, an exceptional event--thanks to Yelp and most importantly, thanks so much to Fogo de Chao."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time because Texas de Brazil was booked. I was blown away with the quality of options as well as the salad bar. Its not even appropriate to call it a salad bar there were so many options. The manager personally came over and talked to us and we explained how we ended up there. He gave us a comp dessert and welcomed us back. Little service steps like that ARE the reasons I would pay more for the same style menu and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"GREAT place!  Tons of meat - meat all night!  Salad bar is a little \"tame\".   Could use more \"sides\" to go with all the meat.  Meat is delicious.  Anything bacon wrapped is on the money.  Servers/staff/manager all super friendly.  Pricey - even with being off the strip.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple Brazilian Steakhouses prior to Fogo. Fogo was a solid Steakhouse but didn't blow me away. The salad bar offered plenty of choices for the vegan. Me and my pasta ways cleaned up on the pasta salad and green salad.   Fogo offered about a dozen meat choices sausage, lamb, beef and chicken. I would say that about 2-3 of them would be labeled as tasty. The rest of the meats lacked any seasoning or taste. It may be for those who want to add to salt and pepper, but I expected more flavor.   It was a great chance to experience Fogo de Chao but it didn't meet my overall expectations. I will try back again as a new location is opening up near me"}
{"text":"I came to this location for a bachelor party dinner. I've been to Fogo in Beverly Hills before so I'm familiarized with what it they have to offer. We had some cocktails before we all got seated. Service was excellent as always and as soon as everyone was seated and got our drinks, the meat started to come around. The staff were quick on their feet and as long as the button is green, everything keep coming. The quality was great, service was on point, if you are looking to host a party, I definitely would recommend this place, especially for a bachelor party!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Las Vegas for a few days, and he wanted to take me to a Brazilian steakhouse, and Fogo de Chao was what he chose. We decided to go here for lunch, and it wasn't crowded, but there were enough people to make it a pleasant dining experience. Our server was great, as well as all of the gauchos who came to our table to provide us meats they were serving. I had never been to this type of restaurant before, and I have to say, I enjoyed every second of it. It was an expensive lunch, but what the heck, we were in Las Vegas, and it didn't matter.... had great food and service."}
{"text":"Really great place for hubby to get his steak and pork fix while I took advantage of some yummy options at the salad bar. It's a typical Brazilian steakhouse set up, if your indicator is green servers come over and serve you a choice of meat. Their salad bar has a ton of options, salad, potato salad, string beans, cheese, a ton of stuff.  Only problem? So, my husband loves to chew ice and was chewing ice at the bottom of his glass when he realized one of the pieces was a piece of GLASS. Good grief. That was scary. The waiter was really apologetic but it was just really weird. Then said the manager would come, but we waited awhile just be courteous and they never showed up. Kinda annoying. I'm sure it was a one off thing but not even sure how that happens."}
{"text":"I write this review with the disclaimer that I'm barely a carnivore.  I'm super picky about the meat I consume (mostly that it does not qualify as \"weird\") and am not very flesh-venturous.    The restaurant is beautifully appointed.  While we did not sit at the bar, it looks like a great place to enjoy a happy hour.  The dining area is large and open.  As we weaved our way around the tables to the \"salad\" bar, it had the feel of a large wedding venue.  The salad bar was extremely varied and nice deviation from the near constant processional of meat.  There was a small salad section but many other choices - fresh mozzarella, potato salad, olives and a number of other goodies.  The yucca bread and polenta fries were fabulous.      The drinks were tasty (they make a mean caipirinha) albeit overpriced (which is to say, Scottsdale-priced).    Desserts ranged from tasty to average.  The flan and tres leches cake were well received.  The cheesecake was tasty but could have come from Costco.    I noticed they had a location in Sao Paulo, Brazil so I mentioned to a friend that we had gone there.  He had been to the Brazil location and said it was the best churrascaria he'd ever had.    So, Fogo is definitely the real deal in terms of Brazilian steakhouses.  My gentle constitution protested the next day from about 3 weeks worth of meat consumption in a few mere hours, but as I said, I'm barely a carnivore."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but they need to do the Pineapple like most Brazilian Steakhouses.  If they served the pineapple they would have received that 5th star but without it and because the salad bar area is adequate but not impressive they are only getting 4 stars."}
{"text":"First off I thought this was going to be a nice restaurant. Boy was I wrong. The set up a strange with green and red cards of bring me more meat or stop bringing me so much meat. And a very 1970s salad buffet."}
{"text":"If you want an out-of-this-world dining experience - this is the place!!! The atmosphere is elegant and comfortable done in style! The service is phenomenal! The food is to die for!!! Watch their video via their website before going and eat strategically to get your money's worth....  This place is expensive - check their web site for current prices. I wouldn't bring small children here and I would recommend at bare minimum, dress jeans and a polo shirt.  A solid 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we quickly realized that if you like your meat well done or anywhere near fully cooked, this is NOT the place for you!!! Thought we'd try it out for my husband's birthday and we were both so royally disappointed. Too bad because we had high hopes and were thoroughly let down. We barely ate anything because all the meat was still bleeding and to make matters worse, because we kept asking for well done meat no one would come back to our table!! Not the ideal dinner date, especially for a birthday!! Won't be going back...but at least we can say we tried it!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning. Love the atmosphere, relaxing brazilian music at a subdued volume, friendly and very polite waiters and gauchos, and the tables are situated at a nice distance from each other.  The food is basically perfect, every cut of meat was seasoned perfectly and was quite flavorful. The sides and appetizers are also good (esp the caramelized banana) but of course the best approach is to save space for more meat :)  I wish there was one in my area (northern California) but when I travel I always try to go."}
{"text":"For those of you that might have second thoughts on going here....get over it!!!! It was the BEST dining experience I have ever had. Food is fantastic and the service is magnificent. You will not be sorry"}
{"text":"Never was told or saw a sign about the $50/per person (i thought it was 35), so it was a nice sticker shock at the end of this experience. Probably will go here once every blue moon unless someone has a big announcement and wants to celebrate, but it's nice to try it just once. Come here hungry as if you want to eat a horse, because that's exactly what is going down in here.  - the salad bar deserves an A+ . - all you can (eat/handle) banana fritters. Lord.....A+"}
{"text":"While last night was somewhat disappointing, the Manager, Evan, made up for it all. He went above and beyond. We will be back thanks to Evan's positive attitude and hospitality."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service is immediate and the attention paid to food quality, preparation, and service is amazing.  Mango Ginger Martini is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great Brazilian churrascaria restaurant. Went in on a Sunday at 12:00pm and paid $35.00 per person plus  $3.50 for a freshly brewed Arnold Palmer with free refills and also tried their flan which is to die for. Definitely a great place to enjoy delicious meats."}
{"text":"Food was great, except for the desert.  We shared the tres leches and didn't care for it.  Bacon wrapped filet and chicken were great, sausage is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Our family came here because it is my father in laws favorite restaurant. Minh and Hugo took amazing care of us and as always we had our fill of delicious foods. We highly recommend visiting."}
{"text":"All I can say, is go to Texas de Brazil instead if you want great Brazilian BBQ. Everything was mediocre-bad, the service was even worse. Poor selection and quality of meats, my filet was 1/2 fat and then they had the nerve to tell me I don't know about meat when I work in the industry! There is a good reason they were 1/2 full when there is an 1.5 hour wait at Texas de Brazil. Next time, I'll take the wait. ...oh, there was only great service person there. Hope he gets a job at Texas."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times now with my girlfirend, her family, my family, etc.  Every time this place has delivered in spades....  my girlfirend loves the lamb, her dad loves the sausage, my mom loves the salad bar....there is just something for everyone.  The waiters are very courteous and attentive.  There was one in particular who is excellent but his name slips my mind I'll be sure to update this review when I remember. Also I have gone for both dinner and lunch and they are the same, in fact I felt lunch may have even tasted a little fresher.  In other words just go this place is well worth it"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST MEAT YOU WILL EVER EAT!!!!! When my husband or friends want to go for an extra special outing this is our go to. There is not a single thing I can say bad about this place. Yes it is on the expensive side, HOWEVER you get 100% what you pay for. All you can eat wonderful beef, pork, lamb, and chicken, unlimited sides, salad bar that includes items like smoked salmon, totally a luxury indulgence.  Best advice, go for lunch Monday-Thursday. They take off $20 from the all you can eat."}
{"text":"I can't believe what happen to my sister on her birthday here!! First, of all yes this place is located in Scottsdale and sometimes I expect rudeness BUT OH MY GOODNESS this was worst than a night in Mississippi on Klan night!!! My sister had reservations for get birthday party to be held there and we were told by the hostess as long as half of the party showed up we will be seated! Well, it's half of us and she turns around with major attitude saying that her manager said that it has to be the whole party here! When,  everyone showed up on time they still made us wait, seated other people before us never apologize, never updated us when we will be seated... Basically just left is in the wind! The manager never spoke to us, he just kissed ass of some surgeons I actually work with!! Don't judge book by its cover!! This place is done discriminatory is disgusting!!!  Save you money go some where else if you want your business valued!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my boyfriend's birthday and we usually frequent TDB, but this year he wanted to try something different. I made reservations for 4 on Fogo's website about a month in advance, but the day of we needed to make a change and they quickly accommodated us with no problems. We arrived promptly for our reservation at 7pm and were seated right away. After our server took our drink orders we started with the salad bar which consisted of different cold meats and cheeses, a few cold salads, 2 soups and a few hot sides. I didn't particularly care for many items on the salad bar, and it was on the smaller side. DO NOT fill up on the salad bar, this is what they want you to do. Save room for all the yummy meats.  When we were ready for meats, we flipped our cards to green and the meat extravaganza began. I had some really delicious cuts of meat including garlic steak, flank steak, top sirloin, bacon wrapped filet and even beef ribs. I also tried parmesan chicken, chicken leg, sausage and pork chops. Everything I tried was very tasty. My favorites were the chicken leg, which had delicious crispy skin on the outside, and the flank steak. MMMM good. As if the meats and salad bar weren't enough food, they also bring 3 side items to your table; mashed potatoes, fried bananas and polenta fries. All carbs, again they are trying to fill you up. The polenta fries were bland and flavorless, skip these if you can, the mashed potatoes were good and the fried bananas were just okay.  I felt at times I was bombarded by the Gauchos (the men that bring the meat to your table) and at times there was no one to be found. We had a few different servers checking on us at any given time, one lady in particular while nice was SO ANNOYING. She kept coming by every 2 minutes to ask if we were done with the mashed potatoes, or if she could clear our plates that still had food on them! I understand that she has a job to do, but I felt like it was a bit much. Seriously, it was every 2 minutes. She wanted to clear our table SO BAD and I can't understand why. When I am done eating and I need my plate cleared, I will let you know, thanks.  When we were finally finished with our dinner, they brought out a piece of cheesecake with a lit candle for my boyfriend. I was delighted to find that the dessert was complimentary, and thought that was super cool. This place is a bit more expensive than TDB, I found the salad bar to be lackluster, and because that lady was sooo annoying I don't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"My husband and I are eating low carb, and we thought this place would be perfect for Valentine's Day. We made reservations, parking was pretty easy, and we were seated exactly at the time we reserved for.   It may have been because it was Valentine's Day, but the place was just so chaotic. It took about 10 minutes before someone finally brought our drinks. The tables are also super close so you can pretty much hear everyone's conversations around you. The restaurant itself is very nice, but it's a bit awkward walking to the salad bar when you're just inches away from someone else as you're trying to navigate through. It kind of reminded me of one of those more formal dinners you have on a cruise. We also heard someone arguing with one of the waiters about already giving another waiter their card for their bill, so be sure to keep your eye on who you give your card to! That was probably just a random and unusual situation though.  The salad bar was pretty great. They have cheeses, salami, bacon, and other salad toppings. The actual meat serving was neat too. You're given a card that you can flip up when you want someone to bring meat to you. They have different types of steak, chicken, and pork. If you make the amateur move that we made, you might eat a bit too quickly and be done with the whole experience within 30 minutes.   The prices are on the higher end. It's about $55 for the churrasco experience (unlimited meat/salad bar) for dinner, but drops to about $30 if you go during lunch. There's also an option for just the salad bar experience which is about $25 at dinner, but I don't think that's really worth it.   The place was a fun experience, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This is always going to be on my Vegas food list.I would've been happy just going back to the salad bar over and over.Very easy to eat low carb/keto here.The meat was spectacular.I'm not a lamb eater (yuck!) so I can't speak to that.Go Go Go! It was $48.50 per person when I went for the whole sha bang (plus drinks obvi).Pricey,but oh so worth it.Come hungry.No..wait.Come famished.That way you can take advantage."}
{"text":"Meat! When my girl asked where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner this year I knew exactly where I wanted to go. Service was excellent and I think I ate an entire lamb all by myself. All the meat was prepared well. There were only one or two pieces that were a little more well done than we would have liked. We even got a free birthday flan from the restaurant. I want to make this an annual birthday event."}
{"text":"The visits only get better! Our second time to eat here and fourth at a Brazilian Steakhouse. The salad bar is incredible and quality (be sure to try the Kale and Mandarin Salad) although we restrain ourselves to leave enough room for the main reason for coming here. The magnificent meat selection and preparation was only outdone, this visit, by the service. The meats, the sides and even the dessert were excellent. The Flank Steak (as funny as that may seem) and the Flan were the clear winners of the night. Our server Diego, as well as the complete staff, made sure we wanted for nothing and had a tremendous experience.  At the onset, this may seem like a 'pricey' place but as I look back on several places in Vegas we've eaten and the cost of those meals the 'bargain' at this Fogo is an experience not to be missed! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Sitting here with the love of my life and having the most amazing presentation. The steak is off the hook. Love this place, OUR server Keith is amazing."}
{"text":"5 stars for food , 5 stars for ambiance, & 6 stars for service!  We had a reservation on a Friday night and we were seated immediately. Our main waiter Steven and our waitress Amanda were both very professional and kind and made sure we had everything we needed at all times. Everything at the salad bar was amazing (which is rare) and I can't say enough good about the quality and taste of the meat. There was not a single thing we tried and didn't love. On our way out, we asked the hostess Destiny how we could get a taxi, and she was kind enough to call one for us. We did have a little bit of trouble getting one to the restaurant, and she went out of her way and looked up taxi companies on her phone to help us get one sooner (another thing we really appreciated) Our first experience here was truly beyond our expectations and we will definitely be back. Thank you Steven, Amanda, and Destiny!"}
{"text":"I am Brazilian and grew up there, I am talking about.  Compared to their other locations this one was a little weak. First off no Pineapple and Chicken hearts. Rice and black beans were below average. That is not cool even if you have delicious lamb chops. Step it up."}
{"text":"More meat than you can shake a skewer at! The bacon-wrapped sirloin caused multiple oralgasms at our table. The appetizer/salad bar was good, if not outstanding. The three sides brought to the table included yummy fried polenta and fried plantains (but the mashed potatoes were boring). The service was good, if not over the top. It was an expensive, but delicious and memorable meal during our Vegas vacation. Now that I've discovered Fogo de Ch?o, I hope to visit the location near me soon."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying...I really like this place. Tonight was the second time I have eaten at Fogo-Scottsdale and like the first time, I paid for it dearly.  I have literally eaten twice what my stomach can hold both times.  Part of the reason is that it's fairly expensive, $50/person, and I feel like I need to get my money's worth. LOL. But the bigger part is that it is genuinely good food. The salad bar is good with plenty to choose from and the sides (plantains, polenta, and potatoes) are also good. When you first sit down the bring you these little cheesy, doughy bread cubes. I have no freakin idea what they are called but they are awesome. Then the meat, this is what you come here for and this is what I over indulge on.  I'm really suffering now but an hour ago I was in meat heaven.  The lamb shanks and the bacon wrapped filet mignon are why I come here. Both were cooked perfectly and were juicy and full of flavor. I believe I sampled everything that they offered except for maybe one thing. The chicken was a lil dry but everything else was good. The service was fine as well. I have to take away 1 star because this isn't Morton's or Ruth's Chris or another top-shelf steak house. I'm actually glad that I can dress casual at Fogo because eating this quantity of food while wearing a suit would suck balls! As it is now, I'm laying on the couch hoping I can eliminate some of this excess food before bed while my idiot chihuahua hops around on my stomach. I'm so meat drunk that I can't summon the will to stop him. I'm actually hoping if he jumps on my stomach enough, it will induce vomiting and some of this pressure can be released. That being said, Fogo was awesome again. Many thanks to my wife for taking me here on my birthday. Hit it up, you won't regret it. Ok, maybe you will temporarily, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The only downside to this place,  is the fact there are no beds next to the table to be able to take a nap before the long drive home.  I definitely highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Well not sure where to start. Was extremely disappointed with the fact there was no dress code. I had to look at a man at the table next to me wearing a tank top with workout shorts. Not exactly what I was expecting when paying over $50 a person. I felt like I was on a cruise ship. Spoke to the manager and he could care less. Interesting that the Fogo in Atlanta has a lot more class. Too bad as the food was good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this Brazilian steakhouse is wonderful. The food is amazing the waiters and servers are constantly looking for ways to keep the delicious meats coming to your table.  When you turn your card to green it's a go for more meat, You have to be quick to turn it back over to red to keep from ending up with a plate of scrumptious meat before you know it. the flavors were wonderful and the restaurant itself is exceptional. I've been to two locations here in vegas and in Atlanta and I have not been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Simply the best steakhouse in town!  Great price for all you can eat Fantastic service  Great elegant decor  Amazing salad selections Tons of meat selections Great location by the strip and free ample parking"}
{"text":"Fogo de chão is a delicious chain. I've been to 3 in 2 different states and the food has always been on point. Tonight, however, was particularly good.  We came for Thanksgiving dinner and it was packed. I personally would've wanted to scream. The staff, however, handled everyone's requests (and inevitable complaints) with ease. One waiter, Vincent, was exceptional. He made a point to check in on us regularly after my cocktail got lost in the chaos of the night.   At nice restaurants, staff can make or break the meal. I'm so happy to say we had an awesome Thanksgiving dinner...and when we come back we're definitely asking for Vincent!"}
{"text":"I dunno, I don't get the hype with these places. It's like a buffet. And buffet's almost never have quality food. I've heard the same about the BH location. I think this is just a churrascaria issue, which is basically, a meat buffet.   I mean, I enjoyed the food, it wasn't bad. it just feels like a slightly nicer Benihana's to me, not sure why I make that connection, but IMO benihana's and all those teppanyaki places are idiotic. Except for the show of it I guess, but, the cost is not justified whatsoever.   I put 2 stars originally, I bumped it to 3 because of this: this kind of place can be a lot of fun for like a boys night out with drinks etc. And we did indeed have a great time. But the other issues persist."}
{"text":"My service really bothered me.  The man that seated us was uninterested, despite telling him it was my first time (on my bday), and made us feel like we were being rushed.  Without giving us more than 6 minutes he asked us for our drink orders 3 times.  Huge wine selection, poor beer selection.  Waiter also handed me the receipt to sign and walked off without even looking at me.  Not a good first impression.  The food was excellent, came quickly and tasted great.  The salad bar was also delicious with a large variety for my wife, who was not eating meat.  I will go back, but my service will hopefully improve.  I like it when people act like they care I'm there."}
{"text":"I had a great time at the Beverly Hills location and was excited to see Scottsdale offer a summer special: $40 with dessert. Even though I ate a lot, I was underwhelmed by my dining experience.   When eating out, I expect service to correlate with the price point of a meal. Fogo's service should be approaching outstanding. At the very least, I shouldn't be questioning throughout: Where is our waiter? Are they going to bring more sides? Are they going to clear our plates? We've been sitting here a while, are they going to offer dessert? Seems like they don't want us to pay, should we dine and dash? At least our water server kept our glasses full.  We ended up just asking him for more sides and he happily filled our request. Props to him because our waiter was useless: unwelcoming,  not personable, not attentive.  On to the food: the salad bar looked fresh and I enjoyed having some greens to munch on between meats and carbs.  The polenta fries had a nice crunch.  The bananas (what happened to thick plantains?) were good but didn't have a nice crispy exterior.  The cheese bread though is amazing, especially when hot. I could eat these all night, every night.  They probably get a star for the bread alone.  The meats were variable.  The lamb was very gamey and I usually love lamb. Some meats were very salty, especially the pork ribs.  I found the beef ribs to be a bit dry. I liked the different sirloin cuts.  My friends found some meats to have huge chunks of fat - I don't mind that because I like the flavor and texture. Just cut them off if you don't, no big deal.  Sausage and chicken were also flavorful. No sight of ribeye all night. I did have a problem with the gauchos not knowing what medium-rare looks like. They kept giving me medium to medium-well even after they slice a piece and checked it. Why even bother asking me what I prefer if they're not going to give the right temp? I wouldn't have ordered dessert if it didn't come free with the summer special. Seemed mass-produced and overly sweet.  Funny thing is that the wait team was very attentive to the larger table next to us. I overheard a patron there raving to his first-timer guests about how the food and service are ALWAYS wonderful here and how he ALWAYS has a great time. Wish I had the same experience. I'll take my money elsewhere for a pricey night out.    I was going to give 3 stars until I realized that was \"A-OK\" and 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Sorry Fogo, you were a 2 that night. Thanks for reading my Fogo essay."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the salad bar, while very good, was not what I was expecting. Reading the reviews made it sound like a HUGE offering of everything you can think of, which is not true. I will say it was good, but I stuck with just taking tomato slices and some of the hard cheeses. The meat that came around that blew my mind was the lamb, not the bone on lamb, but the lamb meat skewer thingy. So good, seriously, I am not a fan of lamb, and this lamb was so good I kept asking for more (which they kindly oblige). So the salad bar options aren't huge, but damn, the meat is crazy good. You will enjoy this place if you eat the carne good stuff!"}
{"text":"Do you remember as I do, playing The Oregon Trail video game on your apple IIe in elementary school? The part I always loved(besides naming people cool names), was the hunting feature.  You would shoot a huge buffalo and could never carry back your entire compliment of meat.  Well, old school video games beware, Fogo De Chao has figured out a way to carry back the entire tomb of meat and place it right on your plate.  No joke, I have never seen more protein in a confined space.  You have around fourteen  options of different meat and by the second round, the types really starts to blur together.  There is filet, strip, chicken, sausage, etc...  The theme, is that comes hot and in mass quantities.  At first look the price tag looks pretty reasonable, but do not expect a  couple to get out of here for below $130 with tip. Yep campers, its around fifty a person for this all you can eat meat extravaganza and \"salad bar.\"    The salad bar is a collection of eclectic items that really do not seem at all like they belong on a salad bar.  That being said, it doesn't matter, because the meat coma you are entering does not allow for further eating, other than the meat.    Now that I have been here once, I imagine I will go back someday, but not in the near future, my stomach is going to need at least another month to digest it all.  Good service, absolutely advertised as what you get for the meal, have to give Fogo a solid rating."}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary - and left shortly after being seated. Menus were dirty, ambiance was ridiculously casual - $50+/plate and included a self serve salad bar ... Maybe we'll try it for lunch???"}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  This is your classic Brazilian steakhouse type joint.  I think they are all kind of the same.  I will say the service staff and salad bar at this location are top notch.  The salad bar has several options and does not have any of the mess associated with your usual salad bar at restaurants.  Reservations for dinner are pretty much a must but while we were there I saw a little of everything in terms of dress.  Don't feel like you have to get dressed to the 9's at this place if you are not up for it.  The meat is good but after a while it all sounds and starts to taste the same to me.  At a little over $50 bucs per head it can get expensive quick.  I have no issue paying over a hundred dollars for my wife and I to eat out but for a buffet.  Not for this guy."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Even for my wife who is vegetarian...the salad buffet is so much more than salad! Love this spot. It is expensive ($50pp) but worth every penny"}
{"text":"Quite simply the best restaurant in Summerlin!  Best salad bar Best meat quality Best variety All you can eat Best service"}
{"text":"Seriously? Hands down, THE BEST STEAK PLACE EVER!  They have every type of steak a meat lover could want. They also offer chicken and pork, ribs... etc. Their salad bar is decent but don't waste your time. It'll fill you quick, and in my experiences there, wait out for the meat. Its a nice place too, so dress up. It ruins the experience of the ambiance. Its a quick eat, we got in and out of there under an hour. I was very impressed. You can start eating as soon as you sit down. And another plus.... you can eat all you want! It's a bit pricey, at like $50 a person starting off, but well worth it, for the experience alone. Its a perfect fun date place too. They have a nice bar area, too."}
{"text":"Too much meat and the salad bar was ok.  You have to ask for the chimichury (sp) and habanero sauces or you'll just be eating meat with a BBQ flavor.  It sounds good but you need to add something or you'll just be eating grilled beef, chicken or pork.  The beef was good and cooked well but the white meats were dry and lacked flavor.  I'm a typical guy who loves steak and prime rib but this was too much.  I was beefed out within 15 mins.  Go if you like eating nothing but meat and stay away if you get bored of it easily."}
{"text":"Good Food.  Overpriced and lacking the service to justify the price. We went with a group for a surprise bday party in the back room.  The hostesses were clueless as to the previously arranged plan for the group to be seated by a certain time.  Even after explaining the situation to them; they could'n't make it happen.  Ultimately, the guest of honor walked in while the group was milling around in the bar area.  Sat at a table in the bar as we were waiting.  no wait person ever acknowledged us.  Went to the bar and ordered a beer and mixed drink.  The bar tender put the drinks down w/out cocktail napkins or  inquiring about   rather I would like the beer in a glass or wanted water, etc. At $16.00 per cocktail; they need to do better.  The salad bar was fresh and with several unique options.   Ultimately, once seated the food came.  the grilled meats were very good; but it was all delivered so fast (6 + different meats in 10 mins) it was a little hard to appreciate and savor any one meat. If all you can eat meat at significant expense is what you're looking for; this place will do. For me; overpriced food for the service.  I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Better than TDB. That's all I have to say. And better ambience."}
{"text":"Amazing! Very fast service. Very delicious food. We loved eating here. Here is very close to Las Vegas Convention Center. After a long day at EXPO, it would be a good idea to stop by!"}
{"text":"Love it! Not a place to go to loose weight, abou to go all out. Will come back here next time we are in LV."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, but you are rushed to hurry up and eat. The meat does not come out very often so you honestly don't get a lot of meat. Very expensive for the bright lit atmosphere, rushed service and the casual attire of all the patrons. Bathroom was extremely dirty."}
{"text":"I will start this review by stating that buffet, mass feeding type restaurants are not really my scene. If they were I would have given this a better star rating. By no means did I not enjoy myself, just not my type of place.   We were greeted with a very friendly host which can sometimes be challenging at Scottsdale establishments. We were seated very promptly at a table alongside the wall. I noticed that the windows are very high so you can't look outside unless you are taller. Not a deal breaker just interesting style of architecture with the builder.  The gentleman that came and explained the process of putting the green and red cards to start/stop the meat being brought around seemed rushed in his explanation and I had a hard time understanding exactly what he was saying because he spoke so quickly.   My best friend and I got up and survey and take in the salad bar. Nothing spectacular. I did find the potato salad was very good, and had some ingredient that made it pop a little more than your regular potato salad. The apple salad was very good too. I enjoyed a little bit of the cheese. The artichoke heart was very salty and not really my bag.   If I knew that sides were going to be brought to the table as soon as we turned our cards to green I would have not even hit the salad bar. The little round rolls they brought to the table reminded me of a favorite South American roll my stepmother always makes when I visit. These were much lighter though, almost cream puff texture. They were addictive!   The cuts of meat were all very good. I personally don't really eat meat so my stomach became quite full very quickly. I did notice that they came around very efficiently making sure we had plenty of meat. Our sides were replenished a few times when there was still quite a bit left. I thought this was a bit on the wasteful side as the food is thrown out, but that's just me.   I think this would be a great place to take a large group because it's fun and interactive. For dinner with just my friend and I it felt a little gimmicky but all of the servers and everyone working was very nice."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Go hungry! Try everything. The seasoning is great. My friend never liked lamb until she ate it here. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"It is a bit expensive, but the food and the service were good.  Although, there were not a lot of variety of steaks that were served compared to the one I had in Miami.  I guess we have to pay attention next time."}
{"text":"talk about full... this place allows you to eat many different styles of Brazilian meats made to order.  I was a fan of most, although it seemed as though there was a little too much salt on all of the meats.  It was a wide array of choices.  My least favorite was the pork ribs which were very dry.  It would not be a suggestion of mine as a place to go on a date, it is $45 per person to eat and I feel to get the full value you have to eat a lot!!  Overall it was a good filling experience, the staff was there all the time and I was never in need of anything, very on top of water refills and fresh plates."}
{"text":"Service Service Service ... the fifth star always comes down to excellent service.  Everyone that came by our table (from the ones filling our water glasses or clearing our plates, to the servers themselves) always made sure that we were happy & getting anything that we might need, or want.  The meats were tender and seasoned, tasting better than other places we've been. Each time we had our plates filled with several variations of flavorful morsels of meat, another walked by with some new item we hadn't seen before...driving us to eat what we had, so we could make room to have the \"new\" ones.  Multiple options of beef, lamb, chicken, and pork, made their dance around the room. The chicken leg was a surprise; juicy with a crispy seasoned outer layer.  The lamb guy saw how I lit up when he served me lamb chops, and made sure to stop by each trip from the kitchen...I usually obliged.  The roasted plantains were wonderful to take bites of between the different meats; refilled every time I polished off the previous offering. \"Yes, more please\" was all I could mumble each time I was asked.  At the conclusion of our meal, when asked how everything was, I made mention of their meats being so much tastier than that Texas place, and was invited to see their charcoal grill in the kitchen.  I was brought to the heart of their operation by Jose, a Customer Service (manager?), who showed me their charcoal \"grill\" with beef on one side and lower temp meats on the left, along with the sea salt they used and some other things...explaining how each server was responsible for keeping track of their meats with varying doneness in order to offer diners the types they preferred.  What a wonderful & unexpected treat to see.    Too full for dessert, I opted for a refreshing glass of their Brazilian Lemonade. I highly recommend it!  Tips: * pace yourself, there isn't a time limit * if you don't know, or can't remember, all their meat offerings, ask for a brochure * ask them about specialty drinks that aren't on the cocktail menu they hand you when you are seated * except for some sauces or vegetables, don't waste precious stomach room on the salad bar...it's all about the meat!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested we try this place and it was an incredible experience!!  This is a very fun and entertaining place to dine, the meats were very good and the service is off the charts. We are Las Vegas locals and we'll be back to this place."}
{"text":"Nothing special, great service and lots of meat. The chicken was a little dry and meat was \"okay\". I'm a beef connoisseur and was not impressed with price of the food compared to the quality and taste of the meat. If I pay $170 for me and the wife to eat dinner (and bottle of wine) I expect to be blown out of the water."}
{"text":"I have written several reviews on this restaurant in the past, but I felt it necessary that I take the time to again write another review. A special lunch was planned for my husband's 83rd birthday celebration. From the minute we walked in until the minute we left we were treated like royalty. The food speaks for itself.  Their Market Table is one of the freshest buffet of salads I have ever seen. Some of which consists of Seasonal Specialties, Leafy Greens and Salads, Charcuterie, Cured Meats, Aged and Imported Cheeses, Antipastos,  Artisan Breads and Whole Foods. Their meats are of top quality and as tender as you can get. Last but not least I would like to make certain to thank John who I assume is the manager enough. He went above and beyond to make certain we were happy with our meals. We so look forward to visiting this restaurant at least once a month. Only wished they were closer to where we live. A very big thank you to the staff who served us on July 18th. You made my husband's special day complete."}
{"text":"When it comes to Brazilian steakhouse's look no further then Fogo de Chão. All others who claim to be Brazilian modeled their restaurant after Fogo de Chão in my experience. The meat is always fresh and delicious. The staff is extremely friendly and if you don't watch it they will try to put you in a food comma. Make sure to pace yourself and remember green means go and red means stop. Do not feel bad to flip it red, or you will not have enough room for desert. The molten chocolate cake is to die for and you have to try some Xingu Gold Beer even if your not a beer drinker this beer is awesome. If you are a beer drinker try the Xingu Black Beer. I have been to Fogo de Chão several times and I have never been let down. If you have young kids and cannot find a sitter I would suggest lunch with the kids and a nice romantic dinner with your spouse. Please remember this is a classy, romantic restaurant so don't be surprised by the price. It will cost more then $75 plus tip depending on what your drinking for a party of two. Remember quality is never cheap. I have recommended Fogo de Chão to several people and I will continue to recommend Fogo de Chão to anyone who asks for a nice place to take their spouse or their date."}
{"text":"Came here after picking up my wife from the airport. Was on a Friday evening at 7:00pm made a reservation but wasn't needed. Went inside and it was about 20% full. Got seated right away. Had an amazing time. Not sure what or how they season the lamb chops but they are to die for. I ate so much I had to waddle out to my car lol .  It seamed to start filling up around 8:30 ish."}
{"text":"Been to so many Brazilian Steakhouses and this one has to be one of the top on my list..  Came here for lunch with a group of friends.  I made reservations in advance (open table!).  Moment we sat down, server introduced and took our drink order.  We were asked if we had been here before.  We were shown the salad bar.  I love how each person would have their own little \"More/Stop\" meat service tab.  Most places would have just one tab for the table.  Very efficient.  Lets start with the salad bar, big selection.  Things that stood out to me was the cheese and salami treats.  I get suckered into that.    We came as soon as they opened so I believe that most of the meat was still cooking, but once we came back from the salad bar.. It's on!  Endless meat and quite a selection.  I found their signature (picanha) was amazing; moist and tender packed with flavor.  Most Brazilian Steakhouses carry the same common meats, but Fogo had a parmesan pork loin (lamb).  I was in for a treat!  Sadly, I could not eat a lot.  The table also had additional side item such as caramelized banana and polenta.  It was across the table from me and I could not reach it.  We each got a dessert.  I went for the turtle cheesecake.  Suck when it comes to cheesecake.  I felt that I picked a solid choice.  When it arrived, lots of caramel.  Smothered it in, and as a nice display, a little orchid next to it.  Amazing! after my first bite.  The service of course was superb!  Most of the meat are well marinated and packed full of flavor of course made me thirsty.  I went through plenty of water, luckily our server was on top and made it endless for me.  I am amazed that they were able to provide such service even when the place was getting a lunch rush.  Lots of places fall short when it comes to the front house, but they got it down here!  The atmosphere here is a little dim, more of the \"special occasion\" type.  Not too loud.  Square and round tables available.  Nice little display on the way in (Rack of meat on a fire pit).    Def will come back.  I just have to build up a better appitite for next time."}
{"text":"What can you say about this place. Great food. Great service. It can be casual or fancy. Everyone fits in. Lunch menu is half price. Great deal. Gauchos are extremely professional. Wait staff is amazing and courteous."}
{"text":"Fabulous food. Incredible quality and taste. Service is impeccable . Cant wait to come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"I'd never had Brazilian BBQ before and was I in for a treat.    It started out with an impressive salad bar that included a wheel of Parmesan that you could carve pieces out of, delicious sweetly marinated peppers, hearts of palm and many other exotic and standard salad items.  The basil salad dressing was very good and a must try!  The main course was a never ending supply of ten types of meat. Everything was delicious except the sirloin which was on the tougher side. The lamb and pork ribs stood out as exceptional.  A word of warning, be sure to remember to flip your coaster to the red side, otherwise you will be overwhelmed with slices of meat being cut and tossed in front of you.  Fogo de Chao is an experience to be had. Be sure to bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Get ready to get meat drunk, then fall into a meat coma!! Although this is not a nationwide chain, this is what a chain restaurant can and should be, it's great. You begin with an immaculate salad bar. Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter. Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy. Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show, the meat!! Transcendental might be too strong of a word, but it is pretty damn close.  It is endless amounts of meat prepared 15 different ways, all seasoned perfectly. You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it. This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don't want to move, lol. And the best part is, is that you tell them when to come to you!! I could go on and on but if you have about 60 bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do!!"}
{"text":"This place is so great. The service is wonderful and the food is delicious! I am a huge fan of those cheesy bread balls!! The bacon wrapped filet and the rib eye were my favorite. Salad bar is not too bad either. Also, platanos in between bites, can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service considering a busy Saturday night. Food is delicious. Will recommend the top sirloin and the jam jelly in the salad bar. I won't give 5 stars just because the parking is a nightmare and it's a bit overpriced, but the food and service deserves A+"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying WOW!!! Can you imagine a place where they just keep bringing you more and more of the best food?  This is it! The sirloin and ribeye were awesome.  Defiantly a cut above your normal steakhouse.  Then they brought out the bacon wrapped filet.  I was in heaven...until they brought out the filet (without bacon)!  This is by far the best cut of meat I have ever eaten. I can't say enough about this place and would go back in a heart beat!!! And then the molten chocolate cake was delish!"}
{"text":"The food here was very good and the service was amazing. If you haven't been I would recommend checking it out just because of the unique dinning experience. I was warned not to eat because of the amount of food that you will receive so we skipped lunch I should have approached it like a blood test and quit eating at midnight the night before. So much meat I never thought I would say the portion was too big but I had to tap out early. Make sure you are ready to eat and if you are planning on going anywhere but to sleep after dinner PACE YOUR SELF. All that said this is a great restaurant and we would eat here again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the ambiance of this restaurant. Not much of a meat eater but still lots of options to choose from at the buffet line. Servers had great customer service."}
{"text":"Worst Fogo I've been to, and I visit quite a few. I look forward to the fresh hot soft cheese bread, this was my reason to visit.. It was hard and stale, told them my bread was old, they took it back and brought me the exact same old lukewarm hard bread. Waiter could've told me they ran out, instead he put it back on my table and avoided us while walking right past us. After that, the rest of my experience was ruined. Never again."}
{"text":"As a first timer here, I gotta say I was very satisfied with the food, the choices of meats and they were all so so delicious. I'd definitely go here again. It's a great atmosphere and area. I dined with my family and ordered almost every meat but the lamb. The skirt steak and the Parm crusted pork is really great too. the bread is amazing. One of the best bread I'd ever had. The chimichurri is amazing!!. I would've given this review 5 stars but near the end the service it began to slow down. We asked for our bill and it was a 20-30 minute wait just to get the bill! A neighboring table that came after us got their bill before us after we requested it for 10 minutes. Aside from that, I'd let it slide and I'll be back."}
{"text":"There are plenty of quality meats to be enjoyed here,  but it is difficult to avoid filling up on the cheap stuff.   I recommend the filet, the flank and the lamb chops.  Everything else was simply OK.  The salad bar was clean and attractive, but personally, I just saw it as filler.  I came for meat!  Service was remarkably inconsistent.  Our first waiter was borderline worthless.  It was difficult to get his attention when our entire table had empty drinks.  Strangely (and fortunately), he disappeared mid-meal, to be replaced by a waitress who was absolutely top notch.  She was astonishingly quick to fulfill or every need.  Without her, this review would have been 3 stars.  In the end, it still felt a little overpriced, but hey, this is Vegas baby."}
{"text":"Beautiful Venue...   From the moment we entered the staff was very welcoming & helpful.  One of the men bringing the meat to the tables was from Brazil... Did not catch his name... He was Excellent!   The meats were all excellent ... Two of them really stood out.   Filet was tender & delicious. Rib-eye was the very best... Tender, tasty, juicy.   They talk about their house specialty meat ... For me it was ok, but nothing compared to the Rib-eye which was my absolute favorite.   The harvest table has a wonderful selection of salad bar type items, plus more items which you would not typically find on a salad bar.  The beets were very good as was the Caesar salad.  Asparagus were jumbo size!   They bring polenta to the table & it is crispy & a real treat!  We asked for seconds!   The fried bananas are like a dessert, so you may want to try those before ordering something sweet!   So happy this great restaurant is in DTS!"}
{"text":"A meat feast!  Woo hoo!  I am STILL full.   The staff was great. Everything was delicious. I really can't pick a favorite. I wish I would have been able to have more of what was offered at the salad bar, but I wanted to save as much room as possible for all the meat. And there was plenty of it.   Thank you Rolando for taking us on a tour of the kitchen. This was so neat. I think he said all but 2 of the cooks were Brazilian.  And thank you Gabi for putting this together. We had an amazing time.  :)"}
{"text":"Never have ever eaten at a Fogo. This was just a mad rush decision the wife and I had. We were under dressed and just been out and about shopping and decided we better eat.  We were seated right away and had our drinks before returning from the salad bar. This was an early dinner right at 5:00. The guys were right on with the meats. They have a new citrus chicken with a slight tang.  I'm also not a big lamb eater and the lamb chops were very tasty.  It was hard to turn the card to red it was so wonderful. We ended up eating so much we couldn't have pie. Maybe next time.  We will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm taking crazy pills but the meat at this place didn't nearly blow me away.   All of the meats tasted like they were seasoned the same way.  I want a variety of flavors and textures when I come to a Brazilian Steakhouse.   I didn't mess with the sides but because I wants to maximize the amount of tasty animal meat that I put in my body.   The service was very good in my opinions.   Almost every time you turn around there is somebody with a cut of meat offering it to you.   I never felt like anybody was rude, overbearing or pushy.    But like I said, I wasn't too impressed with the favor or the meat or the tenderness.    At the price they charge for dinner, I wouldn't go back.  I'd rather have one, off the charts tasty meal for half the price before I have 17 okay pieces of steak from Fogo."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking of this place a month after my first experience here. I absolutely loved Fogo de Chao! If I could change anything about my experience I would have skipped the salad bar altogether and just eat the meat and the sides they brought to the table. My absolute favorite was the petite filet and their house sirloin. The service was top notch and could not have been any better.   I was here for my 2 year anniversary and they gave us a dessert for free. We had the Tres Leches cake which was phenomenal!   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here recently while visiting Scottsdale from Michigan. Our first time in a \"Brazilian-style\" steakhouse, and we were a bit disappointed. The restaurant was nice, not too loud, nice ambiance. Most of the cuts of meat were average in taste and quality. For $150 we were expecting much more, especially with the taste. We were mostly offered sirloin and pork, and the chicken was average tasting. All in all I would not return, I would rather pay that money for a quality filet elsewhere."}
{"text":"just got home from an evening of meat overload. for health reasons, i am a pescetarian...but i made an exception for tonight only. i really wanted to LOVE it. unfortunately, it fell a little short for me. granted, i haven't eaten any meat of any kind in almost 2 years so my palate might be rusty. but i certainly do remember what the consistency of a perfectly cooked piece of meat should feel like in my mouth. hmmm, that might read a little weird.... =o)  anyway, the best thing i ate this evening was the chicken leg. it was well seasoned, well marinated and cooked perfectly with a nice char on the outside.  the rest of the meats, although cooked properly, had a mealy texture. that's the best way i can describe it.  the sides were good. i especially liked the mash. the polenta was also good but just a tad bland.  the salad bar was decent. i loved that they had fresh beets to help your liver get to work breaking down all that red meat! the potato salad was delicious as were the seasoned red potatoes. the greens were fresh and the dressings were flavorful. they even had smoked salmon. yay for the pescetarian in the group! for me, though, it was missing some items that i usually look forward to at a churrascaria like orzo salad, asparagus, bread options, soup, rice, shrimp, etc. they offer a salad bar only option but at $20pp, the selections are not worth it.  and then we come to dessert. i know, i know, it's not a place you go to for dessert but, c'mon, if you're gonna serve dessert, make sure it's worthy to be on the menu. we had the flan. if i'm being honest, it was our least favorite flan ever. texture wise, it was a bit pasty. i like my flan velvety smooth and this was the exact opposite of that.  the service was outstanding!!! drinks were always full which means servers were very attentive. thumbs up to the servers!  all in all, it was decent place to eat. definitely worth a try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"All. you. can. eat. steak. What more can the inner carnivore of every man want? You start off with the salad bar to get your stomach warmed up for the main course: the meat! When you're ready for the main course you flip your card over to green and the chefs swoop in like SEAL Team 6 and carve out pieces of steak onto your plate. Seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if they dropped in from the ceiling when you flip your card over. You definitely won't have to wait long trying to flag a chef down. Moreover, If you're waiting for a particular cut of meat the chefs ask what you're waiting for and sends the appropriate dish to your table asap. My favorite has to be the house special (picana sp?), but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   Service is definitely the best in the business too. All the servers and chefs are attentive, and the manager has greeted my table personally every time to make sure everything is perfect. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants, but can get expensive for dinner, so come around lunch time where it's cheaper and still has the full menu!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying....SO MUCH MEAT. No doubt, make sure to go hungry. We kicked the night off with the  jumbo shrimp appetizer which was phenomenal!   Our server was Brazilian which added to the whole experience. Definitely worth the money and will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas there are 4  churrascaria style restaurants and in my opinion Fogo de Chão is at the top of the heap.  If I were to rank them based on my opinion they would stack up as I have laid them out below.  Fogo de Chão - Overall best meats and service. Good deserts as well! Texas de Brazil - Great salad bar.  Meats can be hit or miss at times. Via Brasil Steakhouse - Good local hangout . Pampas Churrascaria - Pricey as it is located in the Casino. drinks are $$$! Yolies Brazilian Steak House - Think this one is gone :(  Because Brazilian style steakhouses are all about the meats. (Quality, selection, speed of service) We naturally chose Fogo as the leader. We have dined at all the others on the list 3+ times so I feel this review is accurate.  We have yet to dine at Samba on the strip but we eat out often and hopefully will visit next week."}
{"text":"It was worth the price. The meats were tender and flavorful, the server (i'm not sure what to call the person who brought the meat) was more than willing to explain and the atmosphere was great. We had a big party with several toddlers and they were very accomodating. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My hubby took me to Fogo de Chao for our anniversary. It was the first time I had been to a Brazillian style restaurant. The atmosphere was great and the food was good, but I am not sure that I would go back. The reason is beacuse I do not feel that I can eat enough of the food to justify the cost. I do eat meat of all kinds but would just rather have a great filet and call it a day. Now if you are a meat LOVER and like alot of options during your meal then this place may be for you."}
{"text":"Great place, good atmosphere, the food was just awesome! Will come back any day, staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"\"Oh my My\"! This place has outstanding service, it was our 3year Anniversary and decide to try this place for the first time. It blew our minds away everything was impeccable ,tasty savory meats . Excellent lighting more romantic , calm lighting.  Pro*  * great service every one is friendly  * excellent selection of meats  * great lighting  * clean  * easy parking  * great drink pairings   Cons wish it was one where I live .  It's a Must try when visiting or living in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I went to have dinner service was amazing and food too I've been in Texas de Brazil multiple times and I think the meat and everything is almost the same.. my favorite steak house"}
{"text":"Ah, Fogo de chao... you never disappoint! I've been to several of your locations across the county and tried the (only!) AZ location last night, for my delight.  Compared to other Fogo locations , this location is small and tables feel a bit cramped on top of each other. This is NOT a place for a dim-light, low-noise, romantic date. This place is bright, full, lively and full of that awesome Brazilian energy. We are loud people anyways.  Skip the buffet. Maybe pick a leaf or two of lettuce, but focus on what matters the most, which is the amazing variety and quality of meat. The meat is GOOD. If you are planning on going to a regular steakhouse and pay $50 for a cut of filet, better go to Fogo and pay $55 to try all cuts of steak you want! Medium rare top sirloin (picanha) and garlic sirloin and the bomb, btw. You will be happy and you will be full.  You will be interrupted a million times because the meat keeps coming. And keep coming. And there's always someone checking on you, so expect to be interrupted mid-sentence a bazillion times. It is what it is. The customer service in this location is top notch. I felt like everyone was checking on us through the night to make sure we had everything we need. I felt very well taken care.  As a Brazilian, it was also very refreshing to speak in Portuguese with so many super friendly servers and service staff. Our server was Karina and she was an angel through the night, excellent service, personable, amazing. The managers or maître (not sure the labels there) were also amazing and attentive. And then we also had the caipirinha artist, Vince. Vince made us tableside caipirinhas that were probably the best I've had. And I've had a few in my life. Caipirinha was so good and well made I forgot to eat after my first sip. I just wanted to drink lol  Don't skip the pao de queijo, I've had at least 8. That's what I eat when I go to Fogo: pão de queijo, caipirinha and steak. What else do you need?  With that exceptional service and amazing quality, this is the place to go. And I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must try! My wife and I absolutely love coming here. I can genuinely say that the service and the food are all perfect 10's! The servers are constantly refilling our drinks and our food plates are always being filled with an unbelievable variety of meats. I cannot state with enough emphasis how awesome the service is at this location. I can tell that management has trained this staff to be customer service focused."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the trip. Go there hungry because you will be stuffed at the end of your visit. Start off with the salad bar, lots of things to choose from, all of which are tasty. Go light on the salad bar because the actual meal (meat and lots if it) is where it's at. As soon as you have finished your trip to the salad bar, flip your card over to the green side. The servers and different meats are abundant and they just keep coming until you flip the red side up to quench the onslaught. The meats are well seasoned and sooo good! The sides that come with the meal are garlic mashed potatoes, pretty good stuff, fried bananas, also quite tasty, and something else I can't remember...the real star was the meats obviously. The bread they served was kinda like a savory cream puff without filling and a herbed olive oil to put on it...super yummy. Not only was the food good but the service was excellent. Very friendly and helpful, they make you feel like they are happy you chose their restaurant. From beginning to end the whole experience was wonderful."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, wonderful salad bar and the meat is beyond fabulous! I took my son for his 18th birthday and he said it was the best steak he has ever had in his life. Now, this is a young man who has been to many places to eat steak before. I took him here for a reason, I wanted the best for my son on his birthday- so I chose the best Brazilian steakhouse in the state! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great Service.  The lamb was the best.  Great salad bar, but don't fill up on it.  All servers had a smile.  I will be back.  This is a great place."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chão never disappoints! The service here is absolutely impeccable, we have never once had a less than stellar experience and each and every employee in the restaurant (the manager included) is incredibly attentive to customer needs. The meat is flavorful, the original caipirinha tastes completely authentic, and the sides and desserts (especially the flan) are lovely too."}
{"text":"Can't go 1 star because I like the food. Only problem was we only got maybe 10 minutes of the meat before the place they had me sitting was sold cold from the AC. We spend quite a bit going out and don't mind the price tag but in and out in 30 minutes is not cool for a place that should be savored. The only Brazilian steakhouse we recommend is now a place we may never come back to. To not even have a manager apologize is pretty ridiculous especially when we were leaving in such a short time. Didn't want anything free because we ate and enjoyed the little food we did eat, but I come here to eat a week's worth of meat lol. Ventilation should end sooner, otherwise you'll blast each person sitting by the glass"}
{"text":"I have frequented the Fogo de Chao in Beverly Hills and was pleasantly surprised to receive a letter from the manager of Beverly Hills to dine at the new Fogo de Chao in LV. I invited some friends to come along and we had a very enjoyable meal and very comparable to the quality of the Beverly Hills restaurant. I've been to many brazilian bbqs in LV and in Southern CA and Fogo is definitely on the higher end of quality meats. They may not have as large a selection as some other places, but their meat quality and light seasoning is definitely better that others. I was not reaching for water as much as I do compared to other places (like Texas de Brazil) since they over season/salt their meats.   Being a new restaurant, the decor and ambiance was very nice. The service was great as it appeared they had a lot of staff that was extremely attentive to everything that you needed - whether it be a refill on your drink, a new plate, more meat, or something else from the salad bar. They also kept bringing refills of the sides - the mashed potatoes and the fried bananas. Also the cheese bread is one of the best! My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is that their salad bar is lacking in selection. The Beverly Hills location definitely has a larger bar with more variety and I know that some of the other restaurants (like Texas de Brazil) have more selection. However, the place is for meat-eaters, and so perhaps less selection could be a good thing.  Overall, we were all happily stuffed from a very enjoyable meal and will definitely be back for another round soon."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Wait staff was very attentive. The meat was top quality. Salad bar was very big and could easily feed someone that isn't into meat as much"}
{"text":"Sadly, the salad bar was the best part. The sliced meat was ok, but I've had better at similar style restaurants. I was disappointed in the service,  as I was with a group of Chinese and there were some language barriers.  Most restaurants in Las Vegas seem to be able to handle this type of issue without any service problems,  but here the employees were noticeably impatient. In one instance, when asked about one of the menu items (the chicken) the word \"chicken\" was very clear when the question was asked. The waiter repeated it about 5 times to \"confirm\", but it just came off as petty and intolerant.  Considering the $600 check, I thought that was a bit unfortunate."}
{"text":"This was the best Fogo De Chao experience I have had. They were all terrific, but the team here really stood out. They were over the top accommodating and the food was beyond excellent!"}
{"text":"Staff and service was amazing each cut of meat was delicious. I recommend the Brazilian martini along with creme brûlée just awesome I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great service,  it's off the strip so u can cut down on the traffic.  Warm greetings when u walk in.  Lunch served til 2am then they close and reopen for dinner.   Lunch is $33, and worth it.  The meats were delicious,  I loved the lamb chops and filet mignon.   Would definitely visit this place again.  Plenty of parking on site.  Large restaurant with plenty of seating.   Salad bar options are typical rice beans and salad.   Meats come with side of mashed potatoes,  fried polenta, and fried bananas on top of salad bar options.   You have to try the Caipiranhas delish and strong"}
{"text":"Hmmm.  I really liked this place.  My only experience was with Texas de Brazil.  If you're after the MEAT, mostly BEEF, YouGo to FoGo.  It's simply better.  Not so salty.  Their sausage is terrible.  Avoid!  But, I must repeat, their beef is pretty much perfection.  You can pay $50 for a steak on the strip or eat as much ribeye, fillet and amazing sirloin as you want here.  You MUST get reservations if you're going on a weekend night.  We did, luckily.  They were saying a 3-hour wait to folks who had cabbed it from the Strip.  Ugh.  We walked right in and sat down.  I kinda felt bad.  Oh, the salad bar?  Texas de Brazil totally wins that one.  Sometimes we go there just for that.  But, if you're in it for MEAT, this is the place.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The buffet items were fresh and flavorful, all the meats were excellent-juicy and flavorful, cocktails perfect-not shorting customers on alcohol pours, the service was outstanding-always present and assisting, even management made themselves constantly visible and asking if we needed anything... an excellent dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this was not the rating I was expecting to use prior to visiting Fogo. Service wasn't the best.  A few friends ordered a pineapple mint lemonade which I was told tasted like straight pineapple juice and they ran out of mint. We had to ask for more plantains/bread/potatoes. Meat stopped coming around after about 30 mins. That was about 9pm and they don't close until 10 so I don't know why they stopped...we had to ask to have more brought around. The salad bar is really disappointing. Interior is nice and more upscale than other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to. And finally, after being instructed to park in their Oliver garage since they validate parking we were told they ran out of tickets. Overall was it was a bit of a flop, womp womp"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to have dinner here for our anniversary.  He'd visited the location in Minnesota, and raged about it.  I came in expecting great food like he spoke about.  But for my taste the meat was a tad bit under seasoned and chewy.  Their cheese bread is great too bad they don't have soup to go with it. The service was great, no complaint about that."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance.  The only down side is the extremely high cost of dinner which doesn't include beverages."}
{"text":"Restaurant week so a little forgiving. Major slippage. First we were asked 4 times what we wanted to drink. Took over 20 minutes to come. Second drink took 25 after calling manager over. Even though we asked did not come over w filet or rib eye. Never brought dessert.  Salad bar terrific Bill was all screwed up. Upon sitting asked to be divided by two couples never saw that waitress again.  After corrected, bill had 4 drinks not 2 again corrected Place good for lunch.  In need of managerial organization"}
{"text":"Have always wanted to try a Brazilian Steak House so we finally went. Significant other was thoroughly enjoying the whole experience, I was left disappointed. I didn't care for the little bread puffs at all, I thought they were greasy. Then the market buffet / salad bar, lots of options and I really enjoyed that and made 2 trips to have some variety in between the meats. We ordered one of their special old fashioned drinks with carmelized pineapple, they never brought it, upon asking again they brought us a traditional old fashioned and were out of the carmelized pineapple..... ok, disappointing. Menu price for the drink was $15, charged $16, no big deal but really? Meats were slow to start but then came frequently. My issue was the cut of meats, we finally asked for fillet and they brought us our own fillet. Seems the most inexpensive meats are served in plenty and had to ask fir a second small piece of sirloin. Since significant other enjoyed it very much we will probably be back. I will ask for the cuts of meat I want next time and not try the others. Would I recommend them, I don't think so."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday dinner here one night. The concept is great. All you can eat meats and a huge variety of meats at that. They have a salad bar area as well that has a variety of cheeses, salads and other sides.   Love the fact that there are so many different types of meats cooked multiple ways. It's always a fun dinner when you are a Lil unsure what you will be eating. Their house special was amongst the favorites at our table along with the lamb chops. A definite must try.   Though the food was pretty great, the service on the other hand was quite questionable. We started with one server but somewhere in the middle of the dinner we realized we had a new one (we assumed). The original server was nowhere to be seen but another couple servers kept checking on us. There was no handoff, introduction or update just a simple disappearance. We were sat in the middle back area so we did feel we were skipped or missed quite a bit when the meats were being walked around. There were a few occasions when we had to ask for them to come to our table or ask for certain meats to be brought to us. At one point a couple people were quite irritated since they couldn't get food. In the end, you would just think that when you spend that much money on a nice dinner, much more a celebration, the service would be better."}
{"text":"My two sons 8 and 10 and my husband were here for 4th of July and yes there was a promotion for kids eat free with paid adult.  The meats and salad bar everything is delish!  Perfection!  The reason for my 4 star is due to the waitress asking right off the bat how old my kids were?  She said she had a surprise for them in the end!  Well when we asked for the check they had charged us for both kids and the surprise was never mentioned nor did it ever come!  When I made reservations I was advised kids ate free with paid adult so not sure why the waitress would charge us for the boys.  That is my only complaint other than that you should definitely try it!"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to do an update for this one after my recent visit to Vegas and as a disclaimer this is for the service side of things only as the food once again spoke for itself.  So within our group we were celebrating 2 birthdays and a wedding anniversary which certainly created for a heck of an atmosphere (ambiance and we were given free deserts for each event which is always appreciated),  but what the manager Ricardo did for our group was way beyond anything we imagined.  Halfway through dinner he came to check on our table (I'd like to think it had to do with me checking in and my previous 5 star rating on Yelp that got us what's coming up) ha-ha. He came over and asked us if we wanted to take a tour of the kitchen and we all looked at each other wide jawed about even getting the chance to do that, but none of us wanted to say no to that.  It was a once in a lifetime event let me tell you. All employees (which none of us knew) are executive chefs and the meat they bring out is specifically cooked by them as they are allotted to that particular meat preparation for the night. The meat itself cooks in roughly about 3-5 minutes only due to the extremely hot rotisserie oven they have so that definitely explains why the service is always a well oiled machine.    Being able to see Fogo behind the scenes was amazing and one experience I will never forget. However it did give me a new found appreciation (not that I didn't have it before) for the preparation and end result that is Fogo De Chao!"}
{"text":"Now, this review is in regards to my visit on 06/11/2017. I've been too busy to write out what I wanted to say but I figure now is as good a time as any.   This was my second time at this location and I was severely disappointed. First off, I waited at the entrance for a couple of minutes in full view of staff walking by before my presence was even acknowledged. It wasn't busy or anything so I was a little confused. As soon as I called out to someone, I was met with an extremely apologetic greeting which made me feel a lot better. At least I knew it was only a matter of someone not seeing my party and myself walk in. No big deal.   The food looked amazing and it smelled great. My family sat down and made our drink orders. For anyone who has never been here, it's a little pricey so don't expect to be paying any less than $6 for a cute little bottle of beer. But it's a gorgeous restaurant and the service is usually impeccable.   I perused the salad bar and gathered what I needed to make my own smoked salmon bruschetta. The smoked salmon didn't really taste like anything. It usually has a delicate flavor that's very noticeable. This salmon tasted as though it was soaked in water for a while. Some areas of the fish were darker than others so I didn't wind up eating it.   In addition to the salmon, I opted for the chicken salad which actually tasted delicious. But I couldn't finish eating it because I bit down on a chicken bone. I was so sad! After that, I didn't trust the salad so I just pushed it aside. I didn't know what could be done about it but I did let the server know and he immediately informed who I imagine was their supervisor. Someone came to my table to make sure the bone didn't cause any oral injuries which I thought was very nice. It's not the worst thing I've found in my food so it wasn't a big deal. Besides, I was really there for the meat.   Now, on to the meat. Every single piece of meat that came out was incredibly bland. This was a stark contrast to my first visit which was phenomenal. With every piece of meat I tried, I hoped the next one would be a little more flavorful. It wasn't and that was so disappointing. I had raved about this place to my family and it left so much to be desired.   We stayed for maybe thirty minutes - just long enough to try everything. None of the meat had any real flavor so we got up, paid our bill, and made a trip to Rodizio's in Mesa because darnit, we were determined to have unlimited meats! Fortunately, the meal was redeemed in Mesa. They don't have the variety that Fogo has but what they do have is amazing and so delicious - and it's almost half the cost of Fogo. In fact, Rodizio's left such an impression that I'm reluctant to try Fogo de Chao again. Reluctant but not unwilling. My first time there was pretty amazing and that smoked salmon was spectacular.   I'll try anything once, twice if I like it, three times to make sure."}
{"text":"Free valet parking! Top notch, there was a period of time my friends and I were so full we had nothing on the table but when we flipped green they made sure we got food asap. Instead of feeling annoyed, their sincerity made us feel the care."}
{"text":"Amazing meat !!!! Had a really cool server -- josh. He laughed with us and we had such a great time and great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Really really great meat here.  The few booths they have are set up awkwardly.   The salad bar wasn't overly impressive- Texas de Brazil is better for that reason- but in the taste of the meats this place kills them!   Overall we enjoyed it, and we went on a Friday night and it wasn't overly busy!"}
{"text":"It's rare for me to hand out 5 stars, but Fogo de Chao totally deserves 5 stars from start to finish.    As we walked up to the front door, we were greeted with a friendly welcome by a gentleman holding the door.  The hostess greeted us with a smile and a cheerful welcome.  Food was scrumptious, service was very attentive ~ what more could you ask for?!?  The only complaint was that we were so full that none of us had room for dessert.  Cheesecake, Chocolate Molten Cake, Creme Brûlée and more.  We met up with a friend who wanted to have dinner at a nice steakhouse.  Of course, we turned to Yelp, our trusty source for great places to dine.   Fogo de Chao came up on the radar.  We were a little disappointed when we went to their website and noticed that the dress attire was dressy.  Hubby had not packed for the occasion.      We continued our search on Yelp for other suggestions, but kept coming back to Fogo de Chao.  We even thought about going out and purchasing a pair of slacks.  Finally hubby suggested I call the restaurant and see how strict the dress attire was given the 100 plus degrees temperature.  We were advised that shorts and a shirt were acceptable and reservations were recommended.  Hurray....we made plans for dinner and looked forward to the evening.  (on a side note, I read where a reviewer dinged the restaurant for allowing casusal attire.  I for one was very appreciative that the restaurant made an allowance)  We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation time, but were seated immediately.  Once we were seated, our waiter came to take our drink orders and explain how  dinner would progress.  Part I, start with the salad bar plus your choice of rice, beans and potatoes.  Part II, turn your disc to green to let the Gaucho chefs know you are ready to begin your meal.  Turn the disc to red when you want a break.  Our waiter suggested alternating so that you had a chance to enjoy your selections while they were hot.  I can't remember how many selections they offered that evening.  (I lost track, but more on that later)  The salad bar was amazing.  Why you say?  The greens were fresh and crisp.  (nothing worse then a soggy salad) Not only do they have the normal offerings that you find at  allsalad bars, the selection also included marinated shitake mushrooms, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, asparagus spears, strips of bacon (not itty bitty bacon bits) and more!  Our selection of meats for the evening included Picanha (house specialty), filet mignon, rib eye, top sirloin, lamb chops, lamb t-bone, chicken, linguica sausage, pork ribs.  It seemed like there were many more offerings, but these are the ones that I can remember.  The meats were seasoned to perfection.  The Gaucho chefs  would ask how you liked your meat.  Rare, medium rare, medium ~ for the most part, the meat was cooked to perfection.  Our favorites included the Picanha, filet mignon, lamb t-bone and lamb chops.  All dinners are served with sides of fried polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and fried plantains. OMG! I almost forgot the cheese rolls.  These are little puffs of soft cheesy bread that melt in your mouth. You can easily fill up on these, but you'll be sorry if you do.   Service was outstanding.  The servers were very attentive.  If the Gaucho chefs  did not have the selection of your choice, they would make sure someone would be around with your choice shortly.    Like I mentioned early on in my review, my only complaint is that I didn't have room for dessert.  I will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Brazilian steakhouses and in my opinion it wasn't my favorite but it's not bad whatsoever.   Meat selection- they had around 10 different beef/pork/lamb options but no seafood like other Brazilian steak houses.   Salad bar- great selection but no sushi, or really anything interesting. Didn't see soup either  Sides- mashed potatoes were garlicky but yummy, then there was some sort of potato, and sweet plantains.    Price- Compared to other Brazilian steakhouses this place was pricey because of their lack of options."}
{"text":"The food is always great here. Our server on this last visit was so attentive, re stocking the side dishes, making sure we had clean plates. The guys that bring around the meats are always quick to when you turn your little coaster over to green. Overall very impressed and happy to have this Fogo in downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"We attended a Company Christmas party here. This place is amazing! The staff is very attentive. I was overwhelmed with delicious  meats. This place is a meat lovers dream. My strawberry mojito, was delicious as well.     P.S I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Fogo de Chao so I know what to expect in terms of food. Same all over. Good quality. Good selection. What stunned me about this location is the customer service attitude. I ordered a bottle of 2009 Spanish wine. The waiter brought the 2010 bottle and tried to open before I mentioned the year difference. He then claimed that they ran out of the 2009 and it was the same taste. When I challenge his thinking and asked it was a different price he insisted that it has to be the same price and asked me to pick something else if I don't like that!!!! That attitude in a good restaurant is a formula for disaster. Zero attention to customer service will make me not go there again. At least NO to that location."}
{"text":"Good Service, Good food."}
{"text":"I have never been to Fogo de Chao before but I was really happy. we had made our reservations for 7:30pm and they told us there was a 40 minute wait because they were still working on the 7:00pm reservations so I went to the bar for a glass of wine. After about 30 minutes these 2 guys next to me were having the following conversation \"Our reservations  were for 8:00 but they said that they were still working on the 7:30 reservations\"  Reservation problems aside this was a top not food orgy; I think I ate about 6 lobs of meat and it was very very good."}
{"text":"Best of the best. Ask for the beef rib thats not in the menu and skip the salad bar. It doesn't get any better than this place for meat."}
{"text":"THE MEAT NEVER STOPS COMING! I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here. It was great! It's worth the money. I literally had to turn my card over to stop the meat from coming just so i could finish what i had on my plate. I'm not a huge fan of the salad bar, simply because I'm not a salad person but there's rice and beans. They also bring mashed potatoes and Brazilian cheese bread to the table.  We also purchased a bottle of Reisling for our table, which was amazing. I can't wait to come back to bring my family. If you are a meat hound this place is def for you. Any meat you can imagine, they have it!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times before.  That is why I considered 2 stars instead of the least amount poasible, the food has always been good.  This last time I stuck my neck out, recomended this place and took a client.  Upon arrival we were told 15-20 minutes.  We waited at the bar.  40 minutes go by and I see the hostess, sort of stared at hwr in hopes she would notice and check up on things.  Almost an hour later I went up to her asn asked.  She said, \"I'm so sorry, oh i'm sorry.  I don't know what happened your name must have gone away.  My appologies, I'm so sorry\".  When we get sides the rice was out and a few other things were out as well, I did not bother to check if they replenished those dishes.  About 22 minutes into sitting down when we were almost full, they start bringing the meat.  Sort of defeats the very foundation of the purpose of an all-you-can-eat style of place.  At the end of the meal they brough a flan and appologized for the wait.  Take dinner for two, plus bar drinks, plus table drinks, tip, and that was an EXPENSIVE flan."}
{"text":"This restaurant is if the strip. Location is fine. Walk-in greeters are really friendly. Our reservation was not for another 30 minutes but they say us right away. The waiter was super attentive and helpful. The salad bar was amazing. Everything was so fresh. My favorite was the shrimp and mango salad. Perfect sweetness. Now to the good stuff. Every single cut from the pork to the filet minon were juicy and perfectly cooked. As long add you have your green yes please the protein will keep coming! It was a really nice experience just pricey. Would go back again on another special occasion."}
{"text":"We love everything about fogo de chão. Service is smooth, Victor Di Nolfi  service manager is excellent if you ask for anything you get it ASAP. The waiters know how to do their job ( uniforms are Brasilian cowboy style ) Food is delicious ... The meat is melt in your mouth wonderful (hello picañha :-) and the salad bar always has a few surprises.  Go at lunchtime and enjoy the experience for $20 less than Dinner rate."}
{"text":"It was very crowded and very loud. It was just my husband and I so we were pretty much ignored because the waiters were taking care of all the bigger tables. We each got one drink and no one asked us if we wanted refills. The food was good but it was definitely overpriced. It's a good one time experience."}
{"text":"Well folks if you like meat this is the place to be!   Brought my brother here for his birthday to celebrate. I did reserve a spot to make sure we have room.   So they bring you bread and oh it's delicious! Also they bring you mash potatoes on the table & refill it whenever you need it. Also there's a buffet style so you can get what ever you like. There is soup, salad, salami, cheese, rice & etc. they give you a card and you flip it over when you want me and when you don't want anymore you flip it again. If your card is not flipped to receive meat they will not ask you. They do have a lot of choices. They also have chicken, sausage, & etc.  they don't cook the meat well done which I like. Also later after 5:30 they bring other meat like chicken wrapped in bacon & other unique options."}
{"text":"A great fufilling experience.  Come with  a carnivorous appetite.  The salad bar had plenty of options such as my favorites.....sun dried tomatoes,  maple brown sugar bacon,  fresh broccoli,  marinated zucchini  slices, sliced meats, fruit, and antipasta. Garlic mashed potatoes, polenta, and  carmelized bananas was provided for sharing.  You have a round card for each guest beside your plate. One side of the card is green ( which means you  want meat) and the other side of the card is red ( which means no more meat). Several  servers  walk around with any kind of meat you can think of, on metal skewers  ready to serve you.  Top sirloin,  filet mignon, bacon wrapped filet mignon, pork ribs, garlic steak, bacon wrapped  chicken, lamb chops, sliced lamb, pork sausage, ribeye steak are some of the many meats that is served throughout  dinner.  You are able to select  the temperature  you prefer for your meat selection.  This is just a brief  synopsis  of my brazillian experience, which was awesome.  I will definitely  return  again."}
{"text":"Brazilian steakhouses are my weakness. Each time I leave one, I feel like in going to have a heart attack from the amount of meat I ate.  Fogo de Chao was no exception. I didn't eat any vegetables and primarily stuck to the meat and lots of caipirinhas. They were super strong but tasty.   The steaks were great, the lamb was amazing, and the chicken was meh. I stuck mainly to the beef and lamb.  Ask them for all the sauces they have, mixing it up with bbq, their chilli, and other stuff was great. I ended up with a mousse cake which was good as well.   There was a good selection of vegetables, and sides. I didn't have any but my friends did."}
{"text":"Took a group for dinner. The restaurant is clean and set up well for privacy at the tables. The service was good. Our friends had never been there so I expected the server to go thru how it all worked but he didn't do that so we needed to. The market bar was good. The meat came out promptly and we didn't have any trouble getting what we wanted. I would say that sides that came to the table were a little cool and seemed like that had been sitting out but the sides are not that important at this restaurant. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"I made a reservation at this restaurant to celebrate my wife's and son's birthdays and we had never been before.  We had experience other Brazilian steakhouses in the past, so we had an idea of what to expect.  When we arrived, we were greeted immediately and taken to our table.  The waiter explained the process and off we went!    The salad bar area was full of veggies, salads, cheeses and other goodies, but we were advised to save room for the plethora of meats to be served and we were certainly glad we did!  As soon as the coaster was flipped to green, servers with meat appeared at the table to load our plates.  The food was very tasty and the mashed potatoes, cheese rolls and banana/plantain sides served at the table were a great addition!    We mentioned to one of the servers that we were celebrating a birthday and we received a molten lava cake and ice cream with well wishes for the table to celebrate - nice touch!  The only part of the experience not as delightful was the bill - make sure to save up if you want to dine here, especially with a party of 5!  Nonetheless, we will definitely be back for another special occasion."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! High end buffet comes to mind. The meat is great, moist and very flavorful."}
{"text":"This review is based on the front staff working on 1/24 at 6:30pm. Tried to visit fogo's on a busy night, called ahead and asked the wait time, young lady told me that it would be an hour wait for walk in. So we walked 20 minutes from our hotel room to get here and was told they are no taking walk ins, I replied with well I was told 20 minutes ago you do, what looked like a manager and the check in girls smugly smiled and said nope. We were willing to wait the hour+. I've eaten at fogos many times before and have never experienced such horrible service."}
{"text":"If you're into meat, COME HERE! Fogo is a meat lover's ideal version of heaven.  Came to Fogo on a Thursday for lunch with my parents. Every time we come to Vegas, Brazilian Steakhouses our on our must eat list because my dad is a hardcore meat lover.  From the moment we walked in, I noticed how busy it was for a weekday. This place clearly means business. We were greeted by a staff member who was incredibly kind, I wish I got his name! Promptly got us our drinks and off we went to the salad bar.  My mom and I decided to order the mini tasting which included unlimited access to the salad bar and also came with a few ounces of one meat of your choice which then was the deciding factor to how much extra was added to your meal. My dad got the whole damn experience of unlimited meats and salad bar.   The salad bar does not disappoint. There is a TON of food there already, with lots of options! You can get really full, really fast from just the yummy treats at the salad bar. There was even a hunk of meat here for those that wanted a taste.  My mom and I ended up choosing the house special meat - the picanha. Our meat server asked if we wanted half of our portion now and half later, so it wouldn't get cold. I appreciated this since you're supposed to get all of it in one go. This is more than enough food to be completely honest, and it comes at a very reasonable price. However, for those that really want to taste all the different meats, by all means go for it. My dad was enjoying every minute of it.   All in all, I dig this place. It's definitely not something I could eat everyday, but every once in a while it's delicious. The decor is simple yet elegant, and overall, the employees at Fogo are top-notch. Their personalities are incredibly welcoming, which makes the experience even better. However, I'm knocking down one star because my dad said that a few meats were good in taste, but just meh in texture (hard, rough to chew, etc.) Regardless, I see my family coming here for many years to come to indulge in that classic Brazilian-style meat."}
{"text":"Omg - Yes!  I am not a huge red meat lover, but I went to Fogo with a private group. I have never been to Brazilian steakhouse, and I didn't know what to expect.  They have a salad bar, which I didn't experience as well as Brazilian-style sides. The star of the show is of course the meat, which flows continuously. They have steak, ribs, bacon wrapped chicken, chicken wings and etc. The meat is perfection - well seasoned, tender, juicy - just amazing!  I can't really speak about the service since I was in a private area, but the food it definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite spot in Summerlin! I'm so glad they opened this one, because I'm not a big fan of the one on E. Flamingo. I've always loved Fogo, but this one probably has the best service of any of the locations I've been to. This is likely the case because it never gets too busy here, and I've never seen 100% of the tables full. Not even on Saturday night! Seriously service is good here. They constantly come by asking if you'd like a change of plate, if you'd like additional sides or have a special meat request.  Don't fill up your belly too much at the salad bar though because the meats are excellent! Especially if you're a steak lover like me! While they also have chicken, pork, and lamb, my favorite cuts here are all beef! Filet mignon? Yes! Picahna? 2 slices please! And of course my ultimate favorite, beef ribs!   For 50 bucks a person you get unlimited salad bar, meats, sides and bread. This is definitely one of the best steak places around, not just in relative value but their meat quality is really top notch, juicy and flavorful! I always look forward to coming here a handful of times a year! Can't wait until next time!"}
{"text":"Fogo de Chão fucken bad ass full?service Brazilian steakhouse or churrascaria. when I was on the road with Carlos Mencia he loved this place so much I been to almost all of them in the country. It's all you can eat great quality meat. It's fucken amazing. It's so much delicious amazing quality meat cooked anyway you like it. They serve these little bread rolls that I believe are made from the poop of angels. They are so delicious. The Picana is my fav meat and there papaya cream is great. Honestly they work so fast here and are always on top that I didn't have time to take a picture of the meat, but the manager saw that I checked in on yelp and gave us this surprise. So if you ever in Vegas and don't mind popping a baby cow after dinner. This is a must. It's kinda $$$ but well worth it. Maybe not a date night place unless your girl loves to eat meat. ( don't let her fill up tho, make sure she leaves room for your meat) #eatdrinkmomo"}
{"text":"In anticipation of what may be my last lunch at Fogo de Chão for a long time (a change in my work location will make this an untenable lunch option), a decided to write my review of this place *before* eating a meal there.  Once upon a time, Fogo e Brasa was the churrascaria in Phoenix.  It was OK from what I remembered.  It became Brazillian Bull, and more recent memories seem to conjure up images of salt shakers, salt flats, salt water, salt, rock salt, and even more salt.  Before I ever tried Fogo de Chão, I thought BB was a reasonable option due to its lower price, but after trying Fogo de Chão (which I actually like to pronounce as correctly as I can: \"shoum\" with a very soft 'm'), I decided that it would actually be a waste of money, and calorie budget, to go with the cheaper place.  So, why is Fogo de Chão so good?  Two things: the food and the service.  The salad bar and sides are great.  I always like to get a few of their fancy cheeses and the smoked salmon, and a few other odds and ends before my meal.  The Pão de Queijo is delicious.  It's OK to budget space for one or two pieces.  The meats are all good.  You do have to be careful, though: if you don't pay attention, you may find yourself with some chicken on your plate, which can take up valuable gastric real estate better used on a good cut of beef or their leg of lamb (my personal favorite).  They also cook them nice and bloody - every once in awhile, they undershoot it a bit, and the sheep jumps off the plate and runs away.  Best of all, they're seasoned well - even if you get stuck with a mostly-outside piece, it's not too salty.  The only complaint I have is that they never bring me the leg of lamb often enough.  And the guarana is $4.  A little steep for a can of soda, no?  Really, this is quite the fine establishment, and a worthy place to spend ~$40 on lunch."}
{"text":"Most amazing food and salad bar! The meats are tender and delicious, the ambience is wonderful and some of the staff speak Portuguese and are actually from Brazil! We had a wonderful time speaking with them.. Oh and they have Guarana!! Yummy! Please get some brigaderos though :) Please!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times.  This time was not as good a usual.  Service was not as good as normal.  Meats didn't taste as good either.  My wife agreed with me.   Hoping next time will be better.  Cheesy bread was amazing as usual."}
{"text":"Trying to be critical... Just can't find much wrong with this place.   Had dinner here with a friend last week and I was blown away by the selection of meats and the extensive wine list. Now I must say, this place is definitely not a weekly thing or even a monthly thing for most people. At $50 per person (+ drink, gratuity, tax, etc.) this place is in my opinion better suited for special occasions or when you can justify spending $150+ for two people for dinner. Now with that being said, Fogo de Chão has excellent food and almost too many options. They will literally keep bringing you meats until you ask them not to. Their salad bar has lots of options too with huge pieces of vegetables so be careful not to fill up just on that because you easily could. Another thing, the chicken. It is sub par in my opinion. I was told this by several people prior to going and it turned out that they were right. Just something about the way it is prepared. Not sure what it is but try it and you'll see what I'm saying.   The service was fine, not extraordinary, just fine. You may have difficulty getting your server back very often as they bounce around a lot so make sure you get your drinks early on or else you may end up waiting like we did. No big deal, just flagging them down can be hard to do when you don't see them.   Overall, I would say that this place has amazing meat and is a good place to try everything out. Not a place you would visit too often unless money is not a concern for you (or heart disease for that matter). I would definitely recommend Fogo de Chão to a friend of family as a place to meet up and enjoy some food and wine.    Bottom line: I'll be back...eventually."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a friends birthday & since I don't eat meat, I was very please that they sold fish. The fish was cooked so well & tasted amazing! The drinks on the other hand, weren't that really good"}
{"text":"So far I've gone to Via Brasil and Texas de Brazil... hmm, I would say at least four times each. My boyfriend and I finally got around to trying out Fogo de Chao. The meats were delicious (I'm getting hungry just thinking back on on our visit), but I wasn't all that impressed with the salad bar. Though I haven't tried everything at the salad bars at Via Brasil or Texas de Brazil, they seem to have wider selections and I have found some dishes that I like; however, not too many at Fogo de Chao appealed to me. I'll still give them 5 stars for now, though, because I didn't try too many of them and the rest of the food was awesome. Also, it's not a huge deal as I don't go to churrascarias to eat salad."}
{"text":"Food was spectacular.  The meat was plentiful , perfectly cooked, seasoned and served to the table.  Beware the salad bar, because you can easily get filled up and carried away even before the meat comes to the table.  I gave this a 5-Star rating not only for the food, but also because we didn't feel rushed out the door like many other churrascarias do.  In fact, throughout, service was extremely responsive and very friendly.  I felt welcome and stuffed!"}
{"text":"This was definitely an experience. I have never had Brazilian before so I didn't know what to expect. The restaurant was very accommodating as our party size increased from 10 to 12 right before our reservation was booked. They switched tables for us and we were seated about a half hour later than our original time.  When we sat down to eat, I was slightly overwhelmed by all the meat brought around. Everything tasted good- but nothing was so amazing it stood out more than the others. The fried bananas were good as well. I'm happy I had this experience but I dont think it is worth the price."}
{"text":"I have been to Fogo De Chão several times. You may have been saying the name like it sounds, however a waiter mentioned the last word has a nasal pronunciation like \"choum.\" Once you get past the name, and the front door, with the rotating fire pit of meat, you'll immediately notice several distinctive areas.  Starting from the left, are several rooms for meetings or larger parties. These rooms come equipped with a projector, WiFi & a computer. The manager told me while on a tour, that the spaces can be reserved for no additional cost for up to 200 people. There is no down payment or reservation fee either to reserve a meeting room. There are also no cancellation fees. They just want you to have the best group dinner experience possible. The manager was seen taking others on tours around the restaurant. So if you want one, just ask your waiter.  In the middle of the restaurant, just past the host desk, is the salad bar. The salad bar includes special fresh cheeses, chicken salads, slicked smoked salmon, sliced prosciutto, spinach and fancy lettuce, along with many other options. I have only tasted fresh product from the salad bar. The only downside of such a great selection, is that the specially prepared meat is actually what you come to the restaurant for.  Then, slightly behind the host desk is the wine room. There are bottles of wine ranging from $20 to several hundred & beyond. The latest $65 Cabernet Clos Du Val I had was a good choice & recommended by my waiter.  Finally, towards the right of the restaurant is the bar area. It comes complete with several tables for smaller groups to enjoy beverages. This is a good option for people staying in the near by hotel & office complex, to come and enjoy a relaxing atmosphere, in an international setting.  Once you are seated, they offer many side dishes and sauces to compliment the meal including; rice, black beans in sauce, chimichurri sauce, small cheese breads that are tasty right out of the oven, sweet bananas and a few squares of fried polenta. Individually, they are tasty, but again detract from the main idea of the restaurant, which is the meat.  There are more than a half a dozen meats that will be traveling around on long skewers. These skewers are expertly controlled by executive chefs who individually prepare & cook the meat in the back, on a rotating fire, of about 1,000 degrees. The meat cooks in about three to four minutes, that would normally take about 25 minutes in a normal restaurant. The meat is delivered and carved table-side when you flip your meat card over from red to green. Think of a stoplight. Green means yes please and red means hold up.  My favorite meats are the fillet minion, filet minion wrapped in bacon, chicken legs and chicken wrapped in bacon. The chicken is prepared with a beer and cognac sauce, which leaves it crispy and flavorful. The rest of the meats are simply prepared with sea salt. There is a pork that's prepared with parmesan cheese that I did not try, but my table mates said was delicious. After asking around, the parmesan pork is a favorite of the staff.  If you want to try out the restaurant before paying the dinner price, visit during lunch. The menu is the same, just at a reduced rate and for $26, it's a good value. I received a discount on the meal from management. The wine, desserts and remainder of the bill was paid for by my guest. The restaurant is a few blocks East, from the Las Vegas Strip on Flamingo, inside of the Howard Hughes office park, next to the Residence Inn."}
{"text":"Fogo has slipped a bit since they opened - the salad bar isn't quite as spectacular as it was (where are the sun-dried tomatoes, pray tell?), but hey - let's be honest - you don't go to Fogo for the salad bar, right?  This is still the carnivore capital of Scottsdale - a legion of men walking around with swords lined with various meats, and all you have to do to get them to offer you some is turn a coaster from the red side to the green side?  Sign me up!  The Picanha is the house special for good reason - it's amazing!  The top and bottom sirloin are also very good, as are the beef ribs.  Oddly, the ribeye (normally my favorite cut) is among my least favorites at Fogo.  Skip it and get the lamb chops instead (rare).  The sausage is tasty as well.  Not a fan of Filet, so I don't waste the tummy space on it, but those with me who favor it give it a hearty thumbs up.  I really ought to try the chicken sometime, but...it's chicken, and they have beef!  That said, the pork ribs are also quite tasty.  Skip the pork loin, unless that's really your thing.  Let's talk about sides - the cheesy poofs (cheese bread things) used to be fantastic - this time, they were about 3 times as long as in the past (off night?) - they have polenta and garlic mashed potatoes to fill you up on cheap stuff - skip those, but eat several of the fried bananas!  Of course, you saved room for dessert (admit it, there's always room for dessert).  The molten chocolate cake is killer, as is the key lime pie, and the creme brûlée, but...I always get the Papaya Cream - papaya and ice cream blended together, and topped with a black currant liqueur that adds a tart complexity to the wonderfulness that is papaya blended with ice cream - try it, if you don't love it, call me and I'll come over and finish it for you.  Great place to take people when you want a dinner to remember - part dining experience, part meat theater - always memorable."}
{"text":"Get ready for the meat sweats!  A GREAT salad bar.  I've read some reviews on here about how the salad bar isn't that good....I can't understand what the hell they're talking about.  The service is first rate.  The sides are excellent.  Garlic potatoes, polenta, fried bananas, green beans, etc.  Then there's the meat.  Outstanding!  Gauchos running around with their meat on a stick so to speak.  Perfectly seasoned and prepared and a seemingly endless variety.  Pace yourselves because it comes out to your table fast and furious.  Ate so much red meat I actually had to take a deuce in the middle of dinner.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"At best this is three stars. The steak was good, the service was fast and I liked the sides but it was lacking for the price range. I expected more."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Brazilian steakhouses and here is definitely one of the best. The decorate is gorgeous,the atmosphere is relaxing, the service make you feel like home, and every single item on their menu is just spectacular. This place can not go wrong if you wish to celebrate something or to please someone. Their quality is consistently stable, I kept visiting here for about 2 years and they never let me down."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this restaurant for over a year & tonight was the night. Great looking restaurant, nice bar, nice wine list.  Very attentive staff and meat was very good quality. I personally don't dine at buffets or all you can eat establishments so take this review in consideration.  I ate very little off the salad bar and definitely wouldn't come here for just that. It's great & all but why spend $30 at a salad bar? Make sure to eat the ribeye & filet. Don't waste your stomach space on chicken or pork or sirloin. IMHO. The little devilish bread biscuits you get are yum!   We were stuffed after this meal! Dessert was pretty good too.  I think one visit here is plenty. I prefer to spend my $ at a fine dining establishment with one steak versus 1o diff cuts per seating. Also, the sides could use some work.. No one really touched them."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in Scottsdale! My fiancé and I come to Fogo quite often (in fact we got engaged here) and always get excellent service. The steaks are delicious and the salad bar is impressive. We've come to Fogo just the two of us, sometimes with our son and have even had parties here. It's always great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"I was drug here by my 83-year old grandmother. She loves this place. I can see why - the service is very good, the drinks top notch and the meat phenomenal. I love how the servers pedal their cuts. Very amusing.   I love my steaks practically mooing so I am not usually a fan of rodizio, but if you tell the waiters they will make sure to come back to your table when someone else has taken the more well done slices.  All in all a decent value for what you are getting. I prefer to go to non-chain restaurants but Fogo is consistently high quality and when Grandma is paying you don't complain about free meat!"}
{"text":"Brilliant dining experience. High quality and delicious foods. Service is fast, courteous and friendly. The Meats were all just perfect."}
{"text":"Fantastic Experience, Outstanding Meat Quality, Magnificent Service, Worth every dollar."}
{"text":"This was my second time trying Fogo de Chao. First time was at the Beverly Hills location and have to say... wasn't very impressed, especially considering the high $$$ that I had to pay.  I went on Friday for lunch right after they opened but there was already multiple parties that were there before me. I did the 'full experience' which allowed me to choose items at the salad bar and try whatever meat I wanted as many times as I wanted.   When I dined in at Beverly Hills location, I was given meat that were over cooked and very dry... very disappointing. This wasn't the case at the Las Vegas location though! Meat was perfectly cooked at medium rare, all of their meats were very juicy as well. Only down side was that I had a few times where the meat was too salty which was pretty disappointing. *4 stars for the food.  Service here was very good for the most part. I forgot the gentleman's name but there was one person that offered high quality customer service. However his service was offset by a different gentleman who seemed semi-hostile like whenever I declined whatever meat he was offering. *4 stars for the service.  Restaurant was very clean and had great music playing in the background as well. Overall I really enjoyed my experience and will probably come back if it's this location... Free parking was a great plus as well (I had to pay $15 for valet parking at the Beverly Hills location... I will never go back there)."}
{"text":"A pretty unique experience. The salad bar that is included with the meal is great; there is a huge assortment but pace yourself because you're obviously here for the meat! A bunch of different people came to the table with sticks of meat varying from different cuts of beef, to chicken, to pork and lamb. The meat was pretty tasty and my favorite was the house sirloin!!! Service was great, very personable and friendly. The manager came around to each table also which is nice as he checked in with how you were enjoying the experience and food. Easy to get full here so come hungry!"}
{"text":"You got a hunger pain. For Meat! Head to Fogo. Although it's outside of the strip. Easy access via cab. It can accommodate two to 28 plus no problem . Private rooms make it easy to have parties . Huge salad bar, don't eat much ! As soon as you flip the coaster be prepared to eat a lot of meat fast.  Advise:  GO HUNGRY"}
{"text":"Just perfect! Service is superb, food is fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. It was extremely busy, yet everyone was very attentive and caring. Our six year old got a tour of the kitchen which included a lesson on Brazilian meat roasting by a gracious host.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The salad bar was so fresh! Great choices. The server's came to our table with freshly cooked meats of all types on a stick. (Shishkabob?) Excellent service. Enjoyed it. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is a unique, excellent dining experience.   Came here the other day for dinner. $49.95/person but it's all you can eat. The salad bar was stocked with delicious vegetables and cheeses to start with. My favorite was the bacon wrapped chicken. Boyfriend loves all the different cuts of steak. All the meat has wonderful flavor and it's all very tender.   What was even better is that the service here is pretty incredible. They all work as a team so there's multiple people that will service your table. The managers come over to make sure your experience is great as well.   Only complaint is that regular drinks (soda, limeade) were not included in the price. Desserts are understandably extra (and well worth it!) I had the molton chocolate cake and my boyfriend had the cheesecake. They were both great portions and tasted yummy!   It is a tad expensive, but we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Much much food! Great selection, but no pineapple... The only thing I didn't like was how freezing cold that place was... It helps the food to be fresh, but ppl need not to be trembling..."}
{"text":"I've been here couple of times. I love their meat, but i'm not so much a fan of their salad bar (compared to others, I guess). Food overall is good (thus the two stars), but I'm not rating that for now.   Last time I was there, the waiters were very unprofessional. Perhaps, it was not a busy day, but i thought that staying together in one area as a group--chatting, gossiping, I really don't care what they are discussing about--in front of guests is not appropriate in a place as fancy as this. I mean, they were just there, talking, not minding their customers. To be honest, I felt uncomfortable asking my waiter anything because it felt like I was interrupting their conversation. They didn't come back to check if the customers needed anything, except if they were actually called on. It was not a good experience for me (and the people I was with) even if the food and ambiance were great, and it was upsetting that we paid a lot to have service as such. Bottom line: not coming back again (unless if someone's paying). Anyways, there are other Brazilian places in town that I haven't tried so maybe it's time to explore some place else."}
{"text":"Great service and the meats are cooked and served well prepared. Ambiente needs improvement. Too much bright light and at peak times the lines at salad bar can get crowded. Maybe less tables and more intimate setting would help the experience. Staff was friendly and on top of things."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about the best steak I've ever had. Now keep in mind, I've been to six continents, and I've eaten steak in every one. In France, I had steak, in Japan, I had steak, on the border between Belize and Columbia, I've had steak, days before Arab spring's debut in Egypt, I had steak. Of course, the sense of adventure has always been a major factor in my favourite steaks, and this small town in Arizona doesn't have much to offer in the way of adventure, but they did have steak, so naturally I had steak. The steak here was so good that it surpassed every other steak I'd ever eaten, my tiny mind was vaporised the very instant the steak touched my taste buds, each aspect of the steak's decadent being danced on my tongue. The texture, the flavour, the juiciness, all kicked in with just the right amount of force. I was in heaven for a brief moment. This steak is a gift to mankind, and should be treated as such, a steak identical to this one should be displayed in a museum, monuments should be erected just to honour this very steak. I cannot begin to stress how amazing it was, and what your witnessing is just a tiny portion of my emotions toward this steak. Otherwise the service was good, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I would marry that steak if I could. That is all. -Merrick."}
{"text":"I was a little bit disappointed. Salad bar was great. Most of the meat selection was either tough or salty with the exception of filet mignon.  Servers were ok. We were there for dinner on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Happiest place on earth. The food was out of this world, the stuff was very attentive and professional!"}
{"text":"First time at Fogo de Chao. Heard from our kids that it was good.  I researched what Yelpers were saying about it and you were all right!  Our reservations were ready on time on a busy Saturday night. The place was packed. We each ordered a drink ($11 each) and settled into our table. Our waiter did a good job explaining how it all works.   We found the salad bar to be full of delights: fresh greens and various chopped salads, meats and cheeses, toppings galore and a few nice surprises, like Hearts of Palm.   We didn't overfill since we knew of the meat bonanza to come. I can pack away a hefty meal but my wife is petite and I knew I would 'lose money' on her with this place.   During the entree portion, we sampled the top sirloin, bottom sirloin, pork sausage and chicken. The other varieties came around after we were full.  We both enjoyed the top sirloin the best and the chicken the least (overcooked). The fried bananas were excellent but the garlic potatoes lacked imagination.   The service was great, if a bit slow at the end. The food was good but a bit overcooked for a guy like me who likes medium-rare red meat."}
{"text":"As the original McCoy of Brazilian BBQ this is establishment consistently offers top notch food and service.  Have visited their locations in over 10 cities around the country and although each location has had its unique differences on quality of shared menu of foods they serve, they all have ranged in overall satisfaction between 3-5 stars.  The 5 star locations are the Beverly Hills, Dallas, SF, and Vegas.  4 stars for Orlando, Indy, and Atlanta.  3 stars for San Diego and downtown LA."}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks and isn't worth the money spent. You would be better off going to Pucks and eating actually good food LOL"}
{"text":"Norma is the best server in history. She provided the best service and performed above and beyond the call of duty. So, it was my birthday and we requested that she smash all the desserts together in one plate and came through like a champ. So, come visit her because she rocks!!!"}
{"text":"The salad selection was very fresh, the meats were hot and juicy... I was looking forward to the lamb, but disappointed; it didn't taste good to me, heavily seasoned and tasted like it was cooked along with seafood. Other than that everything was fantastic. We came in to celebrate my birthday, they give excellent customer service and even asked for any special requests. Great date night restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dined here on Thanksgiving 2011, pleasantly surprised they were open.  Decent crowd for a major holiday.  Was a long walk from the strip, wised up and took a cab for the way back.  Was my first visit, my husband's second.  He raved about this place.  I stuck to the chicken and pork, the other meats were cooked far to rare for me.  I loved the salad bar!  We plan on going back for Thanksgiving 2012."}
{"text":"The best part about Fogo de Chao is its reliability. No matter what location you go to, the food is always consistently delicious.  It's great to try the different cuts and varieties of steaks, pork, lamb and chicken.   Solid wine list and full bar available.    It seems funny doting over the salad bar at carnivore's paradise, but it is one of my favorites anywhere. Prosciutto, cheeses, grilled zucchini, artichoke hearts... You can get super creative and find yourself enjoying a well balanced meal. Or, you can gorge yourself on the cheesy bread, steak and fried bananas. However you do it, you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Really, it's 4.5 stars.  Better quality of meat than Texas de Brazil but salad bar not quite as good.  Excellent service, lighting a bit dark for my taste.  It did look as if you asked to be sat under the overhead lighting it would be fine.  The cuts of meat were excellent.  After all, isn't that what a Brazillian steakhouse is all about??  Go, you will love it!!  I switch between this and Texas de Brazil.  I do love the lobster bisque there!!"}
{"text":"Having been to Chima in Charlotte, NC, I knew what to expect, in general. I certainly hope that this location of Fogo de Chao isn't representative of all their locations. We had reservations and waiting very little for our table. Our server asked if we were familiar with the concept. After stating yes, he says \"well, good, so I don't have to go on and on about what we have to offer\" Ummm, okay, thank you? Drink orders placed, our party of 4 gets up to peruse to the cold selections. We get back to the table, still no drinks. About half-way through eating the plate of cold selections our drinks show up. The server also brings some of their hot cheesy bread. I think this was the highlight of the evening. Once we turned our discs to green the meat was slow to arrive. Very slow. We actually had to ask for meat. Repeatedly. There seemed to have been a restriction on serving sizes. I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Unlimited steak!  Yes this place is a dream come true, although it is an expensive dream, it is worth every penny.  If your going to buckle down and spend a few bucks, I would highly recommend Fogo de Chao.  Once you are seated, there is no wait, the food comes immediately.  Filet Mignon, Parmesan Pork, Top or Bottom sirloin (Yes there is a bottom sirloin), Rib eye, etc.  They bring you steak until you can't eat anymore.  They also bring you unlimited mash potatoes, cheesy bread, and fried bananas.  Not only is the food top notch, the service is a well.  I don't think i've ever been there and had a rude or incompetent server.  I don't think i've ever left with out a bulging belly, and a food coma!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place from my initial experience at a Fogo de Chao in Chicago so I recommended this place to my boyfriend. Suffice it to say that our experience at this particular location in Scottsdale was less than satisfactory.  There were a lot of little things that happened that all added up to a frustrating experience. First of all, we weren't sure who our waiter was from the get go. We had a male server who introduced himself at first, but then a female waiter who came by later. This made it confusing when we were trying (with little success) to track either waiter down when we needed something.  Secondly, we asked the female waitress for a bread refill (after several minutes of sitting there wondering when someone would walk by) which never arrived. So again, waiting another SEVERAL minutes, we finally waved down the male waiter and asked for bread and water, since we still had not been offered a water refill. The male waiter then decided to walk around filling every other table's glasses before arriving at our table with more water but, again, no bread. He finally brought the bread several minutes later. And mind you the female waiter never asked us or apologized for not bringing bread the first time.   On top of this , we also wanted more soup and there were no bowls available at the soup section. We went back twice to check and still no bowls. My boyfriend also alerted an employee about there being no bowls and we never saw anyone come around to put out more.   Then someone cleared our table without asking us, utensils, napkins and all. When I came back from the salad bar and found I had no utensils we once again had to track down the waitress to ask for more utensils.  Finally, when we got our checks we were charged two full Brazilian dinners even though I had only gotten the Market option. When we alerted the waiitress she said she would go change it but we never received one word of apology from her.  The food was altogether decent, but nothing spectacular and my boyfriend said it wasnt worth the price. I was hoping he'd be more impressed by the experience of it all but it was altogether a pretty frustrating experience. We would have been happier customers if we'd at the very least received an apology or a discount on our checks.  Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"Love love Fogo de Chao! Great atmosphere, food, and service. Very attentive servers! Meat was brought as soon as we turned the discs over to green, management came by 3 times to make sure we were well taken care of and salad bar was fully stocked at all times. If you didn't think you had enough from the buffet part, cheese bread, fried bananas, and other sides were delivered to the table. The pudim, aka... Flan was AMAZIN! It is pricey but WELL worth it! You will get your money's worth. San Jose, CA also a great location! They know how to represent Brazilian BBQ! You won't regret!!!!"}
{"text":"I am certainly a fan. I visited Fogo De Chao while on a weekend getaway. They have really great customer service. I am not much of a buffet eater but this place was good."}
{"text":"Interesting dining experience....servers walk around with huge chunks of meat on a skewer ready to carve you off a slab.  Beef, lamb, pork, chicken....they've got it all and its all at a fixed price so be prepared to arrive with a healthy appetite.  Great for people who love eating ton of food.  They also have a salad bar, included in the price or you can order just the salad bar and forgo the meat.  When you've had enough, simply flip over your red-green disk to red and the meat servers will stop hovering.  Salad bar was extensive, with all kinds of meats, cheeses, salads, toppings -- enough for a meal alone without the meat madness.  Good atmosphere, friendly servers.  A good restaurant, especially if you're doing low-carb or are extremely hungry."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has been inundated with Brazilian Steakhouses over the past few years.  I have been to them all...I had a soft spot for excessive amounts of meat for a while.  There are only two in Vegas worth attending...and Fogo de Chao is certainly one of them.  There are better steaks in town for the price, but nowhere near better all-you-can-eat.  In fact the discrepancy  between price, quality, and value favors the Elite Brazilian Steakhouses here.  There is a wonderful mathematical formula that proves this, but I didn't want to come off \"all Elitist\" on you...so trust me on this one!    I have a problem picking an outright favorite, but I love Fogo for there class, and attention to detail.  They do not have the largest salad bar...they do not even have the largest selection of meats, but they are the most consistent across the board for quality and execution.  Additionally, the service at Fogo is a step above the rest.  When in Rome, order some Roman drink...at Fogo go with a Caipirinha to start or finish your meal.   The other option...a bottle of Malbec!   Malbec has a good price-point in general, and Fogo has some great Malbecs...the result is a great bottle that drinks like a bottle 2x the price."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to dine at I always get great service the salad bar is awesome I always have to take it easy because I don't want to get full off the salad :-) and the steak is overwhelmingly good there's so many choices never disappointing. This last time was particularly great I love it when a manager comes over, he had asked what we thought about there spicy chile and we said well its not \"that\" spicy, he offered us some green chilies and onions (they are not on the menu) phenomenal delicious my husband couldn't get over how good they tasted a great end to a hard week of work ."}
{"text":"There is nothing bed to say about this place . Service is amazing . Food is great . Everything is clean and not. Worth the money for sure till the last dime."}
{"text":"I am never eating again...EVER (ok, until tomorrow).  OMG, so full after eating at Fogo de Chao but it was worth every single delicious morsel.  The salad bar was amazing!  A bountiful selection of deli meats, salmon, cheeses, salads, pasta, veggies.  Everything was as delicious as it was beautiful.  Be careful not to load up on the salad bar though because waiting for you at your table is mashed potatoes, fried bananas, fried polenta and the tastiest cheese rolls I like to call pillows of evil.  But wait, there's more.  The star of the show at Fogo de Chao is the amazing selection of meats that is served tableside.  I love the two sided coasters that signaled to the meat guys whether or not we wanted meat service.  Dinner was better than I could have ever imagined an AYCE could be!  You don't even have to get up and get your food.  If you love meat, this is definitely the place to check out.  Service was also top notch!  We had people checking in on us every 5 - 10 minutes and we wanted for nothing.  Best birthday dinner ever."}
{"text":"My visit to Las Vegas with my granddaughter to see my son and other granddaughter. The nice day visiting and touring didn't seem complete until it was capped off by a good meal at a nice upscale restaurant? ''Food was very good to great'', Meat servers were attentive and seemed to be always present? And as well the salad Bar was very good,  The restaurant overall appeared to be very clean and sanitary! The service though was lacking, No paper towels in the Restroom!' They basically forgot about us? I always enjoy coffee and a nice desert after a good meal? But they never came back? We complained to the manager and our meal was comped? However we went elsewhere for desert and my coffee? ''Thank you''"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I go with my family every year for one of our birthdays and the customer service is always great, the food is amazing and it's all around fun. My tip is to try a small portion of everything and don't over eat at the salad bar. The cheese bread and plantains are bottomless and to die for! Don't forget dessert - I'm not a fan of flan, but man is it good here! It's expensive and completely worth every penny."}
{"text":"I am surprised I have not written a review. I've been here a number of times and recommended it to many.   This is a paleo, gluten free, dairy free, low carb, special dieters delight. Those with Celiac Disease (like myself) can come here and have no issue, even with the bread, which is pan de yucca, a tapioca (a root) flour and cheese bread.   First you gorge yourself with their awesome salad bar with deli meats and cheeses and variety of fruits and veggies.  Make sure you leave room in that 3rd leg though.   Turn over the \"GIVE ME MEAT NOW\" card to green, and you will be inundated with attractive caballeros bearing large skewers of various protein from duck and chicken to lamb and different forms of beef.  If your plate becomes too full, turn that card over to red and stop the flood of rich, well seasoned meats coming to your table until you are ready for another round.  There are also many options regarding drinks, both of the alcoholic libation as well as non. The servers have always been very pleasant and attentive to us each time so my drink never went dry until I wished it to do so.   This is well worth your time and money. It's a little pricy so we only come a couple times a year, but it's special every time."}
{"text":"If you like red meat, then this is your heaven on earth!  Fogo de Chão Brazilian's two course meal; premium salad bar and as much meat as you can eat, is à prix fixe at $49.99. Now this is a steal by whatever measurement you can come up with.   Consider that across the street, Fleming's starts at $44.99 for their Prime Rib dinner; same is true for Ruth's Chris or any of the other steak places in town.   Now don't get me wrong. I am not saying that Fogo de Chão Brazilian's quality is in the same league as Ruth's Chris, Morton's, the Capital Grille or Dominick's; but it as good, if not better than anything we've had a Fleming's. See review.  The other thing that's pretty cool about Fogo de Chão Brazilian's is the entertainment of the Fogo experience -- when their Gauchos start coming around after you turn that card up green. Priceless.    The four of us had a great time. The bill came to $230.50, not including taxes and gratuities.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Fogo De Chao. I booked over the phone for a private room for my wedding reception. Coming from out of town and getting to a restraunt that I have never been to before and having things go so smoothly makes me feel good about planning special events like my wedding reception over the phone. Staff and Food was amazing and they even cooked meat to how each of us liked.  I definately recommend fogo de chao to anyone!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality of food and service. Salad bar was delicious and the meat was succulent. Waiters and waitresses were very friendly and always there when I needed them. Also, salmon was surprised a top choice after I left. Would happily come again."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but great service. Great atmosphere. Great food. Eat in moderation! :) Or else."}
{"text":"If there was an option for a sixth star Fogo de Chao would receive it. They are five shining stars on every level. From food, to service, to ambiance they really take the cake in the \"eat all the meat you can\" category. Without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to.   For starters, they have one of the most beautifully displayed salad bars I've ever seen. If I didn't know you could eat 17 pounds of finely grilled meats I would probably just eat the salad bar and call it a day. But because of the meats, that's just something I cannot commit to. Great salad, awesome toppers, dressings are very good. You even have the option of getting prosciutto, bacon, and fresh bread.  But you're reading this review not because you are a vegetarian, you're reading it because the carnivorous instincts have taken control of your palate. Well fear not my friend, you have made a wise choice in considering Fogo de Chao to be your last meal (you see, it may be your last meal because you quite possibly could keel over after the amount of food you are about to consume). They have somewhere around 14 different cuts of meat. There are options of pork, chicken, and lamb. The pork is exceptionally tender and juicy. My favorite cut of meat that they have is the Filet Mignon and the House Cut. Both are extremely tender and juicy, full of flavor, and cooked to whatever preference you have (anything but medium rare or rare is just a travesty in my opinion though). The side dishes you get for \"fillers\" are really good. My two favorites are the garlic mashed potatoes and the cheese bread/rolls you receive when you first sit down (save room, you may eat a bakers dozen).   Here's one tip though, take your time. You control your meat destiny with a little card that can be flipped green, meaning you want more meat, or red, meaning you are enjoying what you currently have. First time I went here I was on green-time the whole time and my plate was a meat extravaganza. I was overwhelmed with beef. The next time I smartened up and enjoyed my favorite cuts and took my time. A much more enjoyable experience for a seasoned Fogo veteran.  Meat! Meat! Meat!"}
{"text":"This place had really awesome service and served us with any request we had. Minh was especially awesome with the service he gave us. Ask for him as he will take care of you and give too notch service! Awesome food with lots of flavor!"}
{"text":"This was our first time and first experience at a brazillan steakhouse.  The food was flowing and they even provided a handy Thanks! and No Thanks! card for our eating enjoyment. The service was impeccable, with the entertaining and personable server John, who made our evening awesome. Thank you so much for making our night special, it was a pleasure."}
{"text":"Amazing meat, and fun atmosphere! I loved how you can just flip a card over and then you are just flooooded with people giving you different delicious meats in your face. Had our business Christmas dinner here, back in December and it was perfect. The sides were also amazing (mashed potatoes - YUM!) Definitely give this place a try if you have room to stretch your stomach."}
{"text":"My visit at fogo de chao was amazing. My father and I enjoyed a delicious meal and Lucas was a very attentive, charming server. We will be back soon!! The other staff was very helpful as well!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Brazilian steakhouse, the salad bar is clean with yummy salads. The meats are amazing, melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"My partner and I had an amazing experience here. The service was incredible, and the food was even better. We left the restaurant feeling stuffed! Definitely got our money's worth. To put the cherry on top, our waiter asked what brought us to Las Vegas and we mentioned that it was our anniversary.. He then surprised us with a huge complimentary cheesecake! I will definitely be back again when we visit."}
{"text":"I was blown away by this place after my meal I sat there trying to find something negative about this place and honestly I couldn't think of anything. The food was spectacular, the meats were cooked perfectly, salad bar was full of great choices as well as quality products. The wait staff was professional and attentative before my glass would become empty a waiter was on his way with a refill and same with the meats. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed going to fogo! It's was the first time I herd of it when we were invited and I didn't have any clue what to expect. I loved it the food was amazing so many different kinds of meat so good! I don't think there was anything I tried that I didn't like! I will definitely be going back and recommend it to anyone wanting to spend a lot!!(:"}
{"text":"I procrastinated on making Easter reservations and wound up coming here with the bf. Inside it looks like you are at someones wedding reception at a nice catering hall- nice, but unoriginal.  All of the staff were very kind and helpful and we soon got down to business. The salad bar was my garden of Eden! Mushrooms, beets, humongous asparagus spears (genetically altered, perhaps?;) ) the basil dressing? Amazing. I loved it, and even my veggie-shy man enjoyed some of it's offerings (bread and butter!).   Time to get meaty! I have never had so much hot meat in front of me at one time! We quickly learned what we liked (filet and ny strip for me) and what we didn't (bottom sirloin still visits me in bad dreams). I tried two pieces of chicken that were both hard as rocks and a pork sasuage  that was ggggross! I had more uneaten meat on my plate than i had consumed, so after about 20 minutes I cut off the meat flow and went back for seconds at the salad garden.  Before leaving, we finally saw the lamb chops coming around. I love them and had to try them. My first bite was pretty decent. But each subsequent one was fattier than the next. Blech! Enough for me.   I will mention the sides, although they were truthfully unmentionable. The \"crispy polenta\" was overcooked and greasy, the plantains looked nasty but tasted ok. The potatoes were the best of the worst, and we actually ate them. But overall, the sides aren't worth the room in your belly. We had none left, and therefore passed on dessert.  I'd go back for the salad bar, it alone costs $20, but I think it's worth it. Everything else, meh."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Brazillian Restaurant and I must say they are definetly carniverous!  First we started off to the salad bar and the smoked salmon was fantastic!!! They had a salad dressing that was green, I believe it was cesar with cilantro it was absolutely delish!!!  Now at your table you have a coaster, one side is red and one side is green.  When you flip it over to green watch out cause they will be coming at you with all cuts of beef, chicken, sausage, pork, lamb... oh my!  It was very tasty... was TRYING to try everything but it might be impossible for some.  So I had to flip my coaster back over to red!!!  You are also brought sides to go with your carniverous plate... we were served fried polenta, mash potatoes, fried bananas.  You can also opt to go back to the salad bar where they have fried red potoates, rice and black beans.  All in all was a delicous experience.  I know you might ask how was the desert??? and  yes we did do deserts.  We shared the creme brulee, oh my so light and tasty, the chocolate molten lave cake ala mode another fav at our table.  You may not have to eat for 2 days after you've been here!!! This place is great fun for a larger parties!"}
{"text":"You need to go here if you are in LV .  You get lots of great different meat. And exelent service."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao great decision to come here with some small minor mishaps. This is a Brazilian steak house. The meal options at this location is a fixed menu.  They do the Rodizo and that's it so if you're not a meat person I don't suggest this place. We as a group had to order sangria and it was very good wish it had more fruit besides just apples to have sitting in it. Once then we decided to venture to the salad bar , be aware to not fill up to much on the salad and sides. I suggest trying the apple potato salad and roasted peppers. All side dishes are included in the meal  which are garlic mashed potatoes, polenta (which was out of this world) and fried bananas which you can never go wrong with. Now the Brazilian steak Rodizio experience. Some quirks of the meal. At your seat they give you a red and green coaster which red means \"no more meat\" and green \"bring on the meat\". Might have just been where I was sitting at the table but I was sitting at the far end of the table. My coaster was unable to be seen. So the meat cutters walking around would only see a portion of the table and pass by and not check the whole group. Multiple times people at the far end of the table were missed. To the meat my favorite of the filet, top sirloin, bottom sirloin and lamb was definitely the bottom sirloin the flavor was out of this world. The side dishes  but the best of the sides was the polenta. Keep in mind they are complimentary and if you just ask they will bring more, but they did forget a few times when asked. Now to dessert we decided on a pineapple with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream which was out of this world and a to die forCRÈME BRÛLÉE. Overall some plus and minuses to this meal, but definitely worth trying if in the area or other locations across the country."}
{"text":"I visited here for a \"light\" lunch on Monday I was quite impressed here's the breakdown.  Parking:  Easy, there is a lot right in front of the restaurant .  Ambiance: Modern a tad dark.  Service: While the food was quite good it was the service that sold it for me. My waiter explained very clearly about the menu and how to order the meat (basically by flipping a chip on green when you were ready to be served or flipping the chip to red when you needed a break.) The waitstaff is amazing they kept all my drinks filled, my bread basket full, and my plates cleared without me having to flag someone down. They constantly checked on me and my party to make sure we had everything we needed.   Food:  This restaurant has a great salad bar everything I tried was fresh and well flavored. Now on to the meat I tried everything and almost ate myself into a meat coma it was just that good ! Some of my favorites: 1)Top Sirloin 2) Fillet Mignon          3) Bacon wrapped chicken leg 4) Lamb chops  5) The cheese bread  6)The Lemonade I think I drank 4 of these at least.  Number 4 came as a shock to me since I rarely eat lamb but again it was just that good!  Tips: Try to pace yourself it is so easy to eat with your eyes here. Trust me once you turn over that chip to green the meats comes out at a dizzying pace and your gonna want to try it all, so slow down and take it easy.  Try to go during lunch if you can the crowds and the waiting times tend to be less than if you went during dinner  Have them sit you in the first room near the salad bar so you can avoid the long walking trips to and from your table and since this room is closest to the kitchen you get first dibs at the meats.   I will definitely visit fogo de chao again!"}
{"text":"I have a new love of my life... her name is Rib Eye.  I'm not sure why her parents named her that but she's really hot.  She's very tender.  And she feels so good to me... puts a smile on my face!  This is getting weird ok...  First of all, I love this place.  Service is outstanding.  Did you know the waiters cook the meat as well??    So back to the rib eye.  I always loved their house top sirloin, the leg of lamb and the lamb chops, and the filet mignon, but I have a new favorite which is the ribeye.  Juicy, sizzling tender pieces.  So great.  Be sure to ask for their house chimichurri sauce.  Salad bar is definitely not the star, but I liked it.  You're here for the meat anyway people, cmon!"}
{"text":"Although this place was very good, I feel it did not measure up to its key competition, Texas de Brazil.  The facility, staff, food variety were 95% of the way there...but just not quite as nice.  That being said, I did manage to enjoy a couple pounds of deliciously cooked meat.  I would never object to going back, but by the same token, I would not choose it over Texas de Brazil.  The price for dinner was $51.50 per person, not including drinks...or desert, if somehow anyone saves room for that.  Our reservation was for 5:30p on a Friday night and we were seated directly upon arrival.  Parking was ample, plus valet is available, if for some reason you don't mind a stranger in and driving your car."}
{"text":"There must a very large stick or stump up some of these people's asses that are leaving bad reviews. The food is great, meat is tender and flavorful. The salad bar was fresh and we'll put together. Customer service was EXCELLENT! We seriously felt catered to and very much worth the price! Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Honestly quite disappointed.  I have been to numerous places like this and this one was lacking.  The salad bar will minimal...not a lot of goodies, toppings, soup, or anything the others have.  The meat...had little if any flavor and some of the filets were so fatty I couldn't choke them down.  I am totally a meat and potatoes kind of girl and I was bummed.  My husband was sorely disappointed as well.  And then the price...higher than most other places, but we were ok with that going in to it, but not now after eating there.  Needless to say it was ok, but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place!!!  Food is insanely amazing as well as the service and atmosphere!!  Great place to go for high quality meats and foods from their gorgeous salad bar. Fully loaded with authentic flavors and amazing representation.  Deserts are to die for as well!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to dine here for our anniversary. He loves Brazilian steak houses so naturally we were knowledgable on the process. We were sat at one of the tables tucked away in the back. It felt as if we were isolated from the restaurant. Our server, who was a younger woman, greeted our table and was very short with us. She briefly debriefed us on the process of the restaurant an said we can ask any one of the servers if we needed anything during our course of dining. I thought that was a bit unusual, but I was happy that we already knew what to do from past experiences. We had the wine list open and were waiting over 10 minutes to get someone attention to order. A server never came so we decided to give up and just go to the salad bar. Half way through our salad a server came to our table and asked if we wanted anything to drink. At this point we were already annoyed since we were waiting a long period of time to get someone's attention. I declined to our server and said that we would not be ordering any drinks for the evening. We had our green card faced up for a longer period of time before having anyone come to our table. I think it could of been due to the fact that we were placed in an unusual area of the restaurant. We began to keep our green card up for the entire period of time we were sitting at the table so that whenever a server would pass by they would see. By the end of our dining experience we were just extremely disappointed and ready to go home. We received little to no attention at this restaurant that requires a good degree of attention. I will probably not return to dine here again. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Birthday tradition to eat at this place. Always fulfilling. Excellent customer service. Anytime in the mood for steak this is the place to go. Be ready to gain 10 lbs. it is always worth it. Filet mignon and bottom sirloin is a must"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great, as is the decor. The service was great also, but the food was average. Greenfields in Long Beach is better."}
{"text":"Great food and lots of it!  Service was awesome!  Come hungry!  May not be the best for kids as our daughter did not enjoy the variety like us."}
{"text":"I was treated to a birthday dinner at Fogo and it exceeded all of my expectations. The food is delicious and any meat lover will be extremely happy to eat here! The service was excellent and the servers were attentive without being overbearing. I was given a free dessert for my birthday that was the perfect sweet compliment to all the savory flavors."}
{"text":"Tried this place during restaurant week and was not disappointed. Definitely come hungry as the price includes all you can eat and there is so much to choose from! Loved the amazing salad bar and literally tried every kind of meat that came my way. Celebrated a birthday and got a chocolate lava cake that was excellent as well! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My family was driving through Las Vegas to go camping and we were excited to stop by this Fogo de Chão for dinner. I guess we made the cardinal mistake of opting only for the salad bar (we have lived in Brazil for most of our lives and this was never a big issue) when our server sneered at us. We did not know the difference between the salad bar only and all-you-can-eat churrasco option so when we asked the price difference he talked down to us as if we were penny-pinching. When my parents were wondering if we should eat the meat option I responded to the waiter in Portuguese that we would prefer salad service. He, embarrassed that he had treated Brazilians so badly, disappeared presumably to talk to his manager and then came back with a reduced price, which we hadn't asked. This led to an insulting experience for us and an embarrassingly arrogant performance from the server. Next time, we will go to the Texas de Brasil: for the salad... and the churrasco."}
{"text":"Fogo is a great addition to the downtown dining landscape! The atmosphere is serene and the dining room spacious. I dined with a group of 7 for lunch and we were in and out in an hour with full bellies. At $15 for lunch, the Market Table is sublime, with high-quality ingredients and a diverse mix of salad toppings. The stew was more of a generic bean concoction, but no matter - the cheesy bread, plantains and potatoes served tableside more than made up for that minor disappointment. I could've done without our server's attitude when we all ordered the Market Table instead of the Full Churrasco experience (it's lunch!), but maybe she was having a bad day - I've had one or two myself."}
{"text":"we decided to do restaurant week so we went to this location everything was fine but then they brought the bill and the bill was not ours it was someone else's that had wine and everything and I believe these people who had this bill or sitting right behind us and they got up and they walked out and didn't pay their bill...so at the end of our meal a female employee that we've never had contact with during the whole meal brings us our bill which was not ours it had wine on it and everything which we did not order wine or any other thing other than our meal...we told the lady we did not have wine this is not our bill we are not paying for a bill of wine that we did not drink so she  never came back... so we had to hunt down one of the employees and explain to them what happened it took like 30 minutes to get this whole thing figured out and I told her I'm not paying for someone else's wine that I did not even fucking drink it wasn't even at our table their bill was like $160..no fucking way am I paying for someone's table we don't even know who decides to get up and walk out on their bill we want our own damn bill that we work for what we ate...and then when we wanted a certain type of meat it took forever to get it I was not very happy at all"}
{"text":"I've been to several Brazilian steakhouses but nothing compares to this one. Despite the ambience not being as classy as Texas de Brazil, the rapid service and delicious food makes up for it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"For dinner we take a taxi to Fogo De Chao.  The pasta bar is nice but the special apps they serve at your table are even better.  There are some seriously yummy crispy polenta wedges and Brazilian cheese balls.  I continuously remind myself to limit my consumption of these items and hold out for the all-u-can-eat \"meat fest\".    The winning cuts are the rib-eye (juicy and the best cut of the night), the pork ribs (not charred or smoky enough, over-seasoned and too salty for my palate) and the sausage (very juicy and perfectly cooked).  The chicken and lamb were decent but a bit overcooked and not moist enough.  I really wish that SKIRT STEAK was on their menu.  Skirt steak is a meat that is difficult to overcook which work well in this type of grilling environment.  Their flan is amazing and makes my list of my top five flans of all time.    The servers are the best we've had at this type of steakhouse.  When we turn down a particular meat each server repeatedly asks what cut of meat we're waiting for and they promptly deliver it to our table.  Additionally, there are a TON of servers so your meal will not be a long one.  As a result, do not expect a relaxing and drawn out buffet type experience where YOU control the pace.  You know the restaurant's end goal is to get you in and out quicker.  I suppose everyone does win since you eat the cuts of meat you prefer versus getting impatient and settling on cuts which aren't your faves.    Next time I will show more patience and wait for a particular meat with the particular doneness I am seeking.  Also, we will wait it out and take a break so we don't miss out on anything.  We aren't amateurs to this type of steakhouse but I do feel we filled up early on this particular occasion."}
{"text":"Wow. What a unique and wonderful dining experience. The salad bar VERY well done. The meat - unreal. My stomach - exploded. Service excellent, concept fun, atmosphere celebratory. I have nothing but good things to say about this experience. Well, with maybe one exception. Seven people, dinner, drinks and dessert = $650. Ultimately worth it, but be prepared to sell a kidney."}
{"text":"Terrific! I am glad I chose this venue for our anniversary dinner.  I've been wanting to go since they opened, but things have never worked out. My husband and I just celebrated our 10 year anniversary and I wanted to take him someplace special. What do [most] men love? Meat!  I made our reservations on their website and requested a quiet corner for our anniversary.  We were seated in a quieter corner (it is a big open space, noise travels, be prepared for that) where we could talk.  We were instructed about the courses (salad bar first, meat and side next) as they sat down the most wonderful popover style rolls and fried polenta - both hard to resist. We were also warned to pace ourselves. Excellent advice. Hard to follow. There are way too many delicious options.  The salad bar isn't your typical american style salad bar with pre-cut veggies, salad dressings, etc. This had a pre-tossed salad, steamed veggies, dried/cured meats, cured fish, cheese, marinated mushrooms, pasta salad, rice, potatoes, and more that I cannot remember off the top of my head. It was wonderful!  Next came the meat. They use little cards at the table. Green means \"bring the meat\", red means \"no meat needed\". The server brought out cheddar mashed potatoes and cooked bananas for our sides (I didn't care for the bananas, but my husband loved them).   Then come the gauchos with long swords of meat: all kinds of beef, pork, chicken, and lamb. Different cuts, different seasonings, different cooked temperatures. And they come sometimes 2 at a time to the table. It can be overwhelming, but don't be afraid to say no or flip the card over and sample what you have already.  We tried a little slice of just about everything, but over the course of about an hour. We'd get a few slices, flip the card over so they would go to the next table, enjoy, repeat.  Our server, Robert (who was fantastic) brought out a little chocolate lava cake and ice cream with the words \"Happy Anniversary\" spelled out on the plate in strawberry sauce. It was wonderful. But by that time I was so full that I had one bite and taped out.   It was a great experience.  That being said, I dressed up and it seemed like no one else did.  It was a little disheartening to be seated next to a group of guys who looked like they just left the gym - and yes, I get they really can't control the attire of their clientele without going formal..    And for the cost (not cheap, $50 for dinner), I would have preferred a place where people didn't bring little kids.  This is not a family restaurant. I know I wouldn't bring my kids. Men are carrying around giant blades of meat for crying out loud. Their were several babies crying and it was very distracting. I was there to get away from my own babies for an hour or so."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here.  They have a wonderful atmosphere as well as wonderful food.  I enjoy almost every cut of meat they have.  The bar has a very nice feel to it and quite the selection of whiskey.  I don't know what else there is to say. Flip over your card and enjoy the Meat, Meat, and More MEAT!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband was playing in a hockey tournament this past Memorial Day weekend in Scottsdale. He asked me to look up a nice restaurant so we could have a group dinner. Fortunately for us, Fogo was participating in Restaurant Week AND was able to accommodate our large party of 14, YAY!!   I've dined at their LA location before and I've enjoyed every meal. So when I heard they were offering $40/pp during RW PLUS a free dessert (normally $48/pp and no dessert), it was too good to pass up.   Everyone enjoyed their meal and we probably spent an hour just lounging around to digest. The service was great, no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Imagine going to your favorite steak house and ordering the entire menu... Fogo De Chao is exactly that! The food is fantastic and the service is great. Yes it is a pricey meal but well worth it for everything that is provided and a must try.  Plan on doing this with a small group 6 to 8 good friends and you could easily enjoy dinner and drinks here for a few hours, dont be in a rush cause they will keep the best cuts of meats comming all night hot off the grills. They encourage you to try everything and a new selection came by our table every few minutes.   Leg of lamb was my, so favorite full of flavors that I had a cut 3 different times thru the night. Garlic infused sirloin was a close second and everything else was very very good as well. The salad bar was good with great selections to build your first course, try a little of each but keep it light. The molten chocolate cake that we didnt have room to eat some how still vanished it was a great way to finish our meal."}
{"text":"The best of the rodizio-type places in Vegas, at least that I've tried.  Way better than Texas de Brazil, and light years ahead of Yolies.  Tons and tons of Brazilians working here - if you are an expat and feeling lonely for the sounds of home, come for the conversation alone.  Service was impeccable, food quality was high.  The pudim is indeed excellent, as Marcel says, and while it may not meet his standards for rodizio, again, it's way better than the other options in town.  If you want meat, and lots of it, this is the place."}
{"text":"I really thought it was just OK. I read lots of reviews and heard, you must go, but it's lots of yummy beef, some lamb that I really don't eat, and a salad bar. I don't like serving my own salad. I like to be served when I go out. It's cool for maybe a sweet 16 or for a one time thing. I did like the service. I had a nice glass of wine. The potatoes (mashed and sort of au gratin) were just awful, out of a box or something. The salads were fresh and good. I was stuffed and did not eat that much, but we tried a roll, bit of plantain, and a bit of polenta. It fills you up to eat salad and starchy stuff. We brought home a piece of pie and I hope it's good....key lime.......for breakfast tomorrow!  Not sure what the hype is Fogo.....will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Great service great food. Seated right away. Great selection of meat. Some meat are too tough and dry. But the lamb was excellent. Lighting was a little dark."}
{"text":"Prepare to be pampered, from the moment you enter the restaurant the wait staff spoils you. Our group of three started with a plateful of salad from the large salad bar and made our way back to the table. Once seated with our salads in front of us, we were quickly greeted by someone asking if this was our first time at the restaurant. Just having a large salad meant we would not have room for the bountiful skewers of meat waiting to be sliced and served to us.   We quickly put the salad plates to the side and concentrated on the meat. We flipped the card from red to green and like a \"Green light,\" servers with more meat than an army could eat were asking us for specific cuts and meat wellness. Superb! The filet was great and they even had bacon wrapped filet medallions if you wish 5/5. I tried about 7 types of meat and enjoyed the bacon wrapped succulent chicken breasts 5/5. When we thought there couldn't be anymore, we were told its all you can eat so keep the orders coming! When in ROME hahaha.  You wont have room for dessert but you will leave with an amazing meal with some of the best cuts of meat you have ever had! We did try a few of the fried bananas with condensed milk drizzled on top 5/5.   Enjoy and rest well when you pass into food coma at home :)"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place , Wonderful food , Service and Price . Picanha is on point , beef ribs amazing . Bathrooms are kind of dirty . I would love to have a bigger salad bar with more cheese and other options"}
{"text":"Fogo De Chao sure did save the day! We had reservations Saturday night for 8 people across the street at Musashi, when they magically lost them. Frantically, calling every tons of places they took our request, as well as took our cake for the occasion and brought it out when requested. Those couple of things alone were worth the 4 stars.  We are very familiar with Brazilian steakhouses and know what to expect. The manager who sat us explained everything. He was more informative then friendly. Our server throughout the night however was fantastic and I would request him every time! He just refilled drinks, and took plates but he was on it and we appreciated it. He even noticed when my daughter went to the bathroom with a runny nose and came to check on her to make sure she was ok. The food selection is always brilliant. With the salad bar consisting of rice, beans, salad, cold cuts, cheese, peppers, artichokes, olives, beets, and other eccentric items. There are suppose to be 16 selections of meat, but I will be honest I maybe seen 8-10 of them. It seemed they continuously had the chicken or sausage when our table was wanting filet and garlic sirloin. Although with the exception of the lamb taking a while, when requested everything did come out promptly. Same with the sides, the second I would eat the last sweet banana, here came another plate. Towards the end, we asked that our check be split. (I hate doing this, but was not going to argue with the other parties) They ignored our request and brought out the entire bill. To apologize, the awesome server gave us a free cheesecake. Overall, other than the crudeness of the manager at the beginning and end, it was a great experience.    PS- add risotto to the salad bar like some of the other joints in town!"}
{"text":"hate this place.  Manager was an a-hole.  Wanted to charge us a $45 dollar cork charge and didnt even want to work with us. We had a party of 6.  Oh well, his loss.  We went next store and spent over $600.  Great job moron. Steps over a dollar ti pick up a dime.  Pennywise and dollar foolish!"}
{"text":"Company dinner on Friday, 1/15/16 (first time visiting)  There's valet parking available but self-parking is easily accessible as well. We had a room reserved so we walked right in. Service was nice but not sure if it's always like this or because we had reserved a company event here.  The salad bar that came with our meal was amazing. They offer soups, different types of salads (fruit salads, tuna salad, etc.), cheeses, and vegetables. Everything looked appetizing and fresh.  On our table, the servers came by frequently to offer us mouth-watering meats. I especially enjoyed the beef cuts although the lamb was good too. There were also a few side dishes delivered to our table. If there's a particular cut of meat you want and it hasn't circulated to you, just ask the server and they'll send someone over. I might have missed a few because we were among each other and walking around the room.  For dessert, our party was offered either a tres leches or a chocolate cake. Fortunately for us, they ran out of tres leches so we got to try the cheesecake. The cheesecake and chocolate cake were both great. I'd definitely come back again for their salad bar and meat skewers especially the beef.  On your way out, they have a large bowl with mints. In between them, you can also find mint chocolates. Those are delicious."}
{"text":"I don't really know what the fuss is about. I suppose because I didn't do the buffet. It seemed every one else in the party was more than satisfied. I was raised on entrana, and just. I've had better. I guess honestly it deserves four stars, I just gave it three because I heard so many good things, I went there with a certain expectation. If I hadn't, I think I might have been less disappointed. Service was stellar. Location was easy to get to, especially for a city girl like myself. All in all, pretty good. If you're unfamiliar with Brasilian BBQ, pretty good becomes delicious. I'm just spoiled."}
{"text":"Minh and Cameron were super nice and provided excellent service, food amazing as always"}
{"text":"Love.  This.  Place.  It is not cheap and I'm pretty sure I had a mild heart attack from all the fat and sodium I ingested; but oh so worth it.  Not the best cuts of meat and some pieces are a bit fatty but this is pretty much a meat lovers paradise.  I went here as part of a ginormous 30-person party and everything went pretty smoothly considering our group's size.  The staff was very professional and tried to keep everything straight even though things got a little bit hectic.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant when we sat down. The waiter was very monotone with zero personality. His blandness was quickly overshadowed by a great team of servers.   1. The attentiveness of the waitstaff without being overboard is wonderful. 2. They have their timing of bringing new cuts of meat down perfectly. 3. Tons of flavor in everything served. My only gripe is that if you are going to bacon wrap anything, don't let it be soggy bacon. 4. Salad bar was well stocked and everything tried was tasty.  We will be back again. Job well-done!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere and friendly staff! They truly deserve five stars."}
{"text":"I think the sky opened and angels appeared.... Food was AMAZING, but I will be reviewing service.  We had my husband's 40th birthday party here, for lunch. I made reservations online, requesting near the salad bar due to a wheelchair. They allowed for balloons and decorations. The staff were very nice and attentive. They also offered a free dessert for his birthday.  We had a party of 6. So they did add a 18% gratuity onto the check. The bill was $243 and change, I left $250. So worth it!  2 hours later, lots of photos, laughter, meat and iced tea my Dad tried to walk into the  \"meat\" room as we were leaving. Hysterical!  I would definitely have another party here."}
{"text":"This place is exactly the polar opposite of an Outback Steakhouse. Fogo had:  Excellent service, ambiance and food. Quality meats cooked to the right temperature,  fresh sides and an added treat of prosciutto made me a regular.  If your looking for a great meal in Las Vegas Fogo is a must."}
{"text":"If you like this place, you should try texas de brazil.  Food is better by far.  Atmosphere is nice if Fogo de Chao, but thier food is not good.  Very disappointing.  I've gone to all three of the Brazilian steak houses in town that I know of.  This one, the one in town square, and the one in summerlin.  Town Square is the best, then summerlin (hit or miss), but this one was worst and highest priced."}
{"text":"Great food. Better service. I love this place. We were there on a slow night so the meat came often and in large servings. This is the perfect place for that beast of a carnivore in you. Vegitarians beware this is the Meat House!"}
{"text":"Another excellent Fogo de Chao experience, every bit as good as meals enjoyed in the the Austin and Chicago outposts.  I will say, though, that the Scottsdale edition might be the nicest looking restaurant of the Fogos I've seen.  As usual, the Picanha (the signature cut) was outstanding.  However, what really caught my attention this time was the Fraldinha, or lower sirloin.  I do not recall this being so good in previous visits, but it was juicy, tender and intensely flavorful.  Of the two fillet mignon offered, the standard (non bacon wrapped) was the best.  Perfectly medium rare, with a beautifully buttery texture.  Sadly, the bacon wrapped version was too overdone.  Although sometimes it's nice to break up the beef parade with some chicken, I am always disappointed.  The lamb and pork ribs, however, are good alternatives.  The salad bar is fresh and abundant, but don't fill up on too many items here.  What's always impressive to me is the huge wheel of authentic Parmesan Reggiano and it's hard not to carve off a few chunks of rich, salty cheese.    Side dishes are typical: mashed potatoes (which are light and airy), fried polenta squares and caramelized bananas.  The latter are particularly nice to give your taste buds a break from the meat onslaught, with the sweetness playing a nice counterpoint to rich and salty beef.  As usual, I will need at least 6 months to recover from this experience.  But, I'll be back.  Just not sure what city it'll be in."}
{"text":"Wow.. didn't expect that! So disappointing. We ate at some of these restaurants in the past and very enjoyed but this time it was just not good. The meat was very dry and tasteless. It felt like we were sitting in a cheap diner and not a fancy restaurant. We will never go back to this restaurant and I certainly do not recommend for meat lovers."}
{"text":"This was my first time to a Brazilian style steakhouse and it was amazing !!  our waiter Minh was an absolute GEM!! Excellent service and great personality . Food choices were delicious and the salad bar was a great addition for our vegetarian team members.  I will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at this location. First time was 3-4 stars.  On May 21, 2016 the service was ok, the bar was not stocked with three wines that I ordered ($35-$45 a bottle and the bartender tried upselling to a $70+ bottle of wine, the meats ranged from being delightful to fatty and gristly. Don't be afraid to putting bad meat aside.  The filet mignon was generally very good. Hold out for that.  The chicken and pork cuts were not very good.  Three of us amassed a $200 bill, which I was prepared for, but I doubt that I will try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Fogo for several years. The food is continually exemplary! The staff is amazing! My favorite once gaucho, now lead I believe, Marco is always the sweetest. He always checks in on me. They keep the same staples and change up extras. So you always get the foods you love while getting a new and delicious experience each visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent service today.  The food was amazing !  People should always have a bottle of Fogo De Chão Melbeck."}
{"text":"If you love meat, you should come to Fogo de Chao.  Many different cuts and preparations of many different meats - beef, pork, lamb, chicken - are offered continuously.   Someone is always stopping by your table with something new.  The  meats also come with interesting but filling side dishes, so pace yourself so you can eat the meat, which is the main event.  I have also skipped the meat on occasion and gone just for the salad bar, which is excellent and full of good things - not typical American salad bar items.  I was happy with it.  This place is not cheap but it's highly enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is indulgence.  We came for Restaurant Week, could have stayed the rest of my life.  The service was fantastic.  Friendly, very speedy and casual.  I didn't feel like I was in some pretentious joint and could relax and have a good time with my friends.  Even so the atmosphere is completely classy and is an easy choice for a meat-eater's date.    The food was excellent.  The salad bar was extensive with cheeses and veggie options. I did make the mistake of getting too much salad though... save yourself for the masterfully prepared meats!  The garlic steak was one of my favorites, along with the filet mignon.  Very juicy and tender, and perfectly seasoned.  The variety of meats and how they were seasoned and prepared was impressive as well.  The after thought makes my mouth water!  They always have two or three \"how done\" levels on the same serving of meat, and if they don't bring the level of doneness that you want they will immediately return to your table.  Come hungry, and leave over indulged!"}
{"text":"One word...Horrible! Go to the Flamingo location instead. It is unfortunate that my very first review had to be a negative one. I came here for the first time with family to celebrate a new job. Service was great! My bill came out to $274.70 and I tipped $60 cash (around 20%). It was a couple days after when I received my bank statement. They added $93.74 on the tip amount which my total ended up being $368.44. I know I gave cash as a tip and I'm glad I took my receipt copy in case anything happened. I called Fogo de Chao to explain the situation and they said they'd refund the tip amount. Nothing happened over a week so I decided to drive there. The manager came out (the same one that I talked on the phone with over a week ago) to talk with me and went back to his office for about 10 minutes. That was a long 10 minutes, but a server offered me a drink for waiting, which I politely declined. The manager came back out and explained that the person that manages the finances was on vacation and that they would refund me asap. I wasn't expecting anything from them, but they didn't even offer anything at all except for an apology that wasn't didn't seem sincere. I'm glad I looked at my statement because if not, I would have let them get away with that extra tip that wasn't deserved. Too bad I can't post an attachment of my receipt and statement to show the proof. I just hope that the staff and managers aren't ripping other guests off and adding their own gratuity."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. If you have been to Green Forest Churrascaria or Texas de Brazil, then you pretty much know how these Brazilian steakhouses work. They give you a round medallion, and when you turn the green side up, the roving server carrying meat on a skewer will stop at your table.    There's also a salad bar with lots of cheeses, salads, and sides. They bring you mashed potatoes, fried polenta and plantains to your table.  The wines by the glass run about $11 - $14, and the Argentine Malbec Alamos I tried was very good ($11 a bottle in the PA State Store).   Everything I sampled was delicious and piping hot. Servers were very attentive and helful.   Vegetarians will find plenty to eat at the salad bar.   The dining is upscale, so if you enjoy dressing up for a special evening, you will not feel out of place. Every customer I saw was dressed casually."}
{"text":"I felt like a King...but at a king's price.  I had the meal, one mixed drink, and coffee and tip....$78  By the end of the meal, my head was spinning and I was dizzy with the excessive hospiality, the over abundance of great food, great service and good coffee."}
{"text":"I love this Fogo. I've been to the DC one several times, but I think this location is better because:  1. You don't have to be dressy for dinner here. I came in in shorts, nice ones, mind you, but they were still shorts.  2. The service is amazing. As soon as the hubs needed a refill of his beer, or as soon as our sides needed some replenishing, someone was at our table before we could even ask for assistance.  The meats here tasted fantastic, as I've expected from Fogo de Chao. All in all, it was a great dinner and I'd urge anyone to come here for some quality meats (love the fraldinha, the bottom sirloin, and picanha, the top sirloin), salad, and the amazing sides (warm cheese bread, polenta, and caramalized bananas)."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse.  Salad bar is outstanding and the quality of the meat is first rate.  The marinade on the meats are so flavorful without being over powering.  The service was exceptional.   From the moment you walk in everyone is do professional and friendly. We loved this place and can't wait to visit again during our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Never disappoints ...  great service and fantastic food!!   There's a reason why it's always packed, they have the right recipe for food and drinks."}
{"text":"In town for business from Houston.  My work partner wanted steak and had never been to a Fogo. So of course I had to bring him here.  Was not disappointed and he liked it so much he was  talking about taking his wife to the Houston location for their anniversary because of our great experience here. Overall great experience, service was excellant and well worth the money."}
{"text":"I would like to be able to say our experience at this restaurant was as wonderful as it has been in the past, but this time an incident occurred that has caused me and my friends and family to never return there again.  My daughter and friends took me to Fogo last night for my birthday.  We enjoyed right up until the bill came.  Some insensitive, ignorant waiter wrote a very derogatory message on my daughter's ticket. When we saw the comment we were appalled, disgusted and extremely angry.  It is unbelievable and inexcusable that such a comment come from anyone at any establishment, but from this upscale restaurant it is even more appalling!  How dare he!!  The management was insincere and handled the situation very poorly.  We asked that the guilty party be brought to the table for a formal apology to my daughter.  That never happened although we stayed and waited at the table for quite a long time.  Instead the GM offered her a gift card to come back for another visit.  Was he some kind of crazy?!  We will never return to this restaurant!!  My daughter has been hurt beyond belief, and is dealing with the emotional fallout this incident has caused her.    How about some harassment and sensitivity training Fogo!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Brazilian steakhouse. The choices of meat are excellent compared to other steakhouse. There's three type of sirloin. The lamb chops are great as well as the chicken wrapped bacon and pork chóp. The ribeye wasn't as good as a ribeye steak, but at least Fogo offers this selection. The salad bar had everything that you would want. For #Thinsulin fans, this is heaven as there are so many green light choices."}
{"text":"Still no apology from manager or anything. I guess this place loves to hire RUDE staff. Perhaps there are no good female employees in Vegas; they must all have OTHER types of jobs. I WILL NOT GO HERE nor recommend this place. In fact, a month ago we were looking for a place to celebrate my cousin's birthday and I absolutely refused to go here. We went to a restaurant with a proven reputation and polite staff!!"}
{"text":"I had come here on Mother's Day and I didn't have such a good experience. Milton one of the Customer Service Managers took care and invited me back for a free dinner for my troubles. This in itself was super unexpected and much appreciated. This is not where my review ends...it gets better. Tonight (about ten days later) we wanted to come here for dinner, but I couldn't find my complimentary gift card that Milton had given me. I called the restaurant to see if Milton was there, but he wasn't so the wonderful hostess transferred me to Mauricio the manager. He was able to confirm this for me and when we came in for dinner he came by the table to say hi, checked back in with us to see how it was and he brought us a complimentary desert with thank you written in caramel. So sweet!  The food is always delicious, but with great service like this we won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food. Great service and house made liquor. The garlic knots are to die for! Think of the fullest you've ever been.. you'll leave here more full."}
{"text":"This's was my first time to this chain and maybe my expectations were too high because this place was Good not great. The prices were very expensive. The food just so so.  I've had better Brazilian steak houses in Las Vegas before. The lamb was very gamey  and not that tender. The best meat available was the filet very tender and cooked perfectly. Skip the filler meats like the skirt steak it's tough and very salty and nothing special.   The mash potatoes that come with the meal was good nicely buttered russet verity. The popover rolls were delicious so buttery and flaky good. The salad/appetizer buffet was disappointing the line was mega long for mediocre buffet salads. The wine list was nice with a great variety the prices were slightly above average for a bottle of wine.   Service was good the meats kept on coming around frequently and you can request a favorite cut and temperature of the meats as well."}
{"text":"The buffet is great but the meat is not bad it's very salty and you can tell it's been frozen for long."}
{"text":"Awesome place for my Birthday dinner! The staff is very attentive and the food is excellent.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Roommate and I love Brazilian Steakhouses and Texas de Brazil is usually the place we go to. Today, we decided to try Fogo de Chao since it's on our side of town. We went for lunch, and upon entering we already were given a look by the host. Apparently, we don't look rich enough to eat there because the server also gave us a look and rolled her eyes when we asked about dessert (it's included at Texas de Brazil and we were curious if it was here too, or if we should save room and still buy one. She never did bring a dessert menu. Also, server disappeared forever, she never brought the mashed potatoes that are to come with the meal. On our 2nd round of meat we just asked some one else for it. Additionally, soft drinks are non refillable. They charged like $4 for an 8oz bottle of Diet Coke, never offered another. I would have happily purchased another bottle if the server had come back.  As far as the meat itself goes, I received a very fatty piece of some bacon wrapped garlic steak. Didn't eat it. I asked for the bacon wrapped chicken, it never came. I guess they were ready for us to go.  I did, however, enjoy the ribeye. The butternut squash and coconut soup was very good.  Market table was mediocre at best in comparison to Texas de Brazil. The rice literally tasted and had the texture of Uncle Ben's ready rice, the microwaveable version. Beans had no flavor.  All in all, just drive the extra 15 minutes to Texas de Brazil at Town Square for a much better experience."}
{"text":"Wow, this place rocks! Great atmosphere, fun and fantastic food. The salad bar is unlike anything I've ever seen. Surprisingly, the never-ending parade of perfectly prepared meats is as entertaining as it is tasty."}
{"text":"The picana is off the hook, come for lunch for a discount. The salad bad is fresh and colorful, and service is super attentive. Lots of parking, and made my Vegas trip so sweet. Love the staff :)  Thanks especially to Jose for the amazing service, attention, and love!"}
{"text":"So my flight got cancelled and I find myself in Vegas an extra night. As I drive to the hotel, I notice Fogo and remember a fellow yelper mentioned how good it was. Might as well try them since it's close and I am stuck in Vegas another night. Sooooo glad I did. The salads were fresh, every meat cooked to perfection, and the service was outstanding. Two of us came for a late lunch, and it was $75 before tax & tip. Not bad for the quality of everything. Dinner is higher, but I'm not sure if there's more meat to choose from or not. The rib eye was my favorite. Ask to sit in Thompson's section. He was fantastic!"}
{"text":"If you love meat, I cannot possibly fathom why you wouldn't love this place.  When you feel like being the big fatty you always knew you were, go here and indulge.   There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said, so just to confirm:  -- The interior is beautiful and their wine selection is very impressive. -- The salad bar contains all that is good.  TRY not to spend too much time there, but I must confess that I loaded up on the cheese (parmigiano reggiano FTW) and smoked salmon. -- All of the side dishes (which are also endless) are winners. -- The meats are all very very good, but some are more impressive than others.  Their Alcatra is amazing, especially if you get an outer, crispy slice.  It's basically beef bacon.  Also, their lamb is superb -- seasoned just enough to expose the flavor of the meat.  Their chicken unfortunately falls short compared to everything else. -- Go for lunch.  It's the exact same experience for ~$15 less per person.    It's a bit pricey, (~$30 lunch, ~$45 dinner) but it costs about as much as the high end buffets in Las Vegas or a high end steakhouse, and it arguably surpasses the former in quality while easily beating the latter in quantity.    Bottom-line: Save up on both your cash and your calorie intake and then indulge like the glutton you are."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner and it was fabulous. All aspects surpassed our groups expectation. As expected the meats were perfectly cooked. The staff were extremely attentive. They explained the processes and helped us get our food just as we liked. The market food bar was a delight. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Yum! We love this place. It's a fun place for special occasions, and the food is delicious. It is pricey, but for a once in a while treat, it is worth it. I recommend making reservations, even if you don't think it will be busy. Plus, they'll ask if it's a special occasion on the phone- let them know if it is a birthday, anniversary, etc., and you can score complimentary dessert (that you will likely be too full to finish). We just made reservations for Christmas Eve, since we cannot be with our families this year, we figured we'd spoil ourselves!"}
{"text":"Fogos presentation for their food never disappoints. The staff are always very friendly."}
{"text":"I don't really leave reviews but I had to for this.  They never asked if we wanted sides   But the waiter told the manager he did. Twice.  All we wanted was a free Diet Coke and the manager literally said I won't do that.  On top of all that you could tell the meat was frozen.  No real taste. No salt and pepper.  It smelled and seemed old. The filet mignon Was driving didn't have that signature Brazilian smell or taste.  This was truly a bad dining experience. On top of that they bring you in for a 30 dollar restaurant week special. The ad just says all you can eat.  But when you get there they make you upgrade to get the better cuts of meat.  This place is just not good."}
{"text":"We just recently went because my brother was married in Vegas and it was awesome. I really enjoyed the food and if you like strong drink they have there house specials and believe me its wroth the money. They are pricey but you get to enjoy ton's of different meats and you leave super full and satisfied... also service was great!!"}
{"text":"Meat-Topia!!! You have to mentally prepare yourself for the onslaught of meat that comes your way. It can be intimidating. Don't be shy and use the red stop and green go card liberally to catch your breath between bites and visits from waiters with meat skewers who are at the ready to pile your plates.  All the meats cooked nicely with varying cook temps on their skewers (R, MR, M, etc..). The meats were well salted and had a nice fire grill crispness to the edges. Complimenting the cooked animal bonanza was a nicely assorted salad bar with all the fixings. Dessert is also very good here, my favorite is the flan. This place is a steal for the price and what you get for $40."}
{"text":"Being married to a meat and potatoes kinda guy, I thought booking dinner for Valentine's Day at Fogo de Chao would be a huge treat.  It turned out to be a huge disappointment.  We went last night and will never go back.  We were seated promptly, way in a back corner...about as far from the salad bar as you can get.  This place is packed with tables.  You literally have to stand and wait as servers and other customers weave through the tables.  I found it strange that staff didn't let customers pass first - they blew by customers as if we didn't exist.    We were seated and got the lowdown on how it all worked.  We were excited to be there and dig into the amazing salad bar and try the different meat choices.  Our trip to the salad bar was chaotic.  The line was going every which way and people were reaching over each other to get to the different selections. Everything on the salad bar was fresh, the presentation was nice but what a hassle!  We were given some rolls which were odd.  Soft, undercooked dough filled with some sort of cheese.  I can eat some bread, but the texture of this stuff was just not right.  The meat...honestly, I'm not much of a carnivore, but even my husband was far from impressed.  All of it was dry and so salty that we were reaching for our water glasses constantly.  The service was what was really odd.  The skewer guys would show up in our section in such a rush that they missed our table (and others) most of the time.  You have to wave them down or ask passing busboys to get service.  By the time the pork ribs and rib eye came around (after my husband spoke to our server about the lack of service) all of the sides were cold and we were just over it and full from the massive amount of water we had to drink.  We are not tough to please people.  We don't do pricey restaurants often and were really looking forward to having a fun experience at Fogo.  I regret booking our Valentines dinner at this strange, silly place.  Should have gone with my first instinct and headed to Durant's for  tried and true great food and perfect service.  Live and learn."}
{"text":"The service and ambiance are great. However, I am not big on steak and prefer chicken but I did try to eat many meats there. I wasn't too impressed especially with the limited chicken choices. It was just meat and to me, lacked variety or unique flavors which I thought they were supposed to have. I wouldn't spend this much money again. Some people may really enjoy but it just wasn't great for me. I did want to try the ribs but it never came to my table. The sausage wasn't anything great either and I love sausage."}
{"text":"$40 summer special per person. The meat was delicious and the ambiance very nice. The waiters were very attentive... Though a bit too attentive. Every one would stop by our table and ask if we were ok. There are coasters you flip to the green side if you want more food, so we had way too much attention and kept getting interrupted. That would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"Okay so the Valentine's Day experience was amazing! I strongly recommend this place. When we walked in, we were 30 minutes early. The lady at the counter said it was probably going be around our reservation time. 15 minutes later we got sat. Our seater didn't say a word to us. Okay I guess. Sure. Then our server came up to us. He was good and very quick. He didn't seem laid back or any of that. I don't know how to explain it but he was good at his job but gave bad service?   Anyway on to the food. We went to the salad bar and I loved it so much I had to go back again. Their potato salad is perfect, the chicken Caesar salad was amazing, and my favorite was the tabbouleh. I'm middle eastern so I was really excited about the tabbouleh. It tasted just like my moms! The meats were so delicious and each of them had a different but perfect taste. All of the were juicy too! I can't really list them because I tried about 10 different kinds. We tried the crème brûlée. It was so delicious! It came with blueberries on there and if you include the blueberry with the pudding, it makes it so much better. At the end of our meal, when we paid for everything, they gave us a card for a free meal (lunch or dinner!) I can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"We came for valentines day and it's crazy busy all the time!!! Great food but we waited 20 min for our check so the server brought us two free dinner gift cards!!!! Amazing way to over make right what's been done wrong... Slow service at the end to get our check was more than compensated for and we will for sure come back again"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Fogo, Texas, or Via Brazil.  All 3 are very nicely decorated, staff is properly trained, and food is as good as it gets.  This was my first attempt at Fogo and here is what I discovered.  The salad bar is fresh and the choices are similar to Texas, however the Italian dressing tastes identical to a bottle of Kraft that you can buy at Smith's.  Not very unique like the balsamic dressing at Texas.  Nothing is labeled either.  It's kind of obvious as to what each item is such as lettuce, cheese, whatever but I still like to see the titles of each item being served.  No sushi, no lobster bisque, no soup at all at Fogo. This is where I give the top honors to Texas for their salad bar.  Onto the meats... I read a reviewer state the top sirloin was NOT the best meat at Fogo.  I found that hard to believe and after experiencing for myself, he was right.  But the thing is at Fogo, they call about 3 different looking meats \"top sirloin\".  One was the obvious one that looks kind of heart shaped with mild fat on the outside.  Another big chunk of meat was also called top sirloin.  It looked and tasted like Via Brazil's prime rib. Fogo's garlic sirloin was the best of the 3 places.  I must give the best meat award to Via.   Side dishes are minor but I liked Texas and Via's banana's, rice better than Fogo. Restroom was tiny.  Men's had only 2 toilets and 2 urinals.  Texas has a much better restroom facility.  Overall verdict.... me and a friend gave top overall to Via because of their super tasting meats.  Texas has the best salad bar but we are not there for greens."}
{"text":"Vegetarians, stay home.  This place is a meat lover's paradise. I don't think I've ever eaten so much meat in my entire life.  But before the meat service begins, you start your meal over at the gourmet salad bar, which was not why I was there. After picking up a couple olives and leaves of lettuce, and a slice or two of onion, I felt good about having a nice balanced meal.  Back at the table, it's time for the real food to begin. The servers come by immediately, bringing a dozen different kinds of meat, filling up your plate as many times as you can handle. Lots of beef, like top and bottom sirloin, filet mignon, ribs, and ribeye, plus lamb chops, leg of lamb, pork ribs, parmesan-encrusted pork loin, chicken with or without being wrapped in bacon (like I'd eat chicken that's not wrapped in bacon), and sausage. Every meat was delicious, tender and juicy, full of amazing Brazilian flavors.  Also included with the meal were various side dishes, like a pretty good cheese bread, mashed potatoes, and carmelized bananas - but I was here to eat meat, so I didn't have a lot of those.  In the end, I don't know how much I ate - I'd guess each portion to be around 2-3 ounces, and I probably had at least 20 portions (everything at least once, several things twice), so probably around 3 pounds of meat. With all the different flavors constantly coming, it always seemed fresh and new.  At $62 (including soft drink, tax, and tip), it's a little more than I typically spend on a meal, but well worth it. This is definitely a place I'll be back to, maybe a few times a year. It will take that long to recover from my meat-induced coma anyway."}
{"text":"This is for sure the best Brazilian steakhouse I have been too. Try the Parmesan cheese pork and the house special!"}
{"text":"Simply the best!!!  We have to visit each time we're in Vegas!!  We've gone to the LA location and it just isn't the same.  We dined with a party of 18 last weekend for my brother's wedding and the service was amazing!!   All in attendance were completely satisfied and raving about the experience!!!   We Fogo!"}
{"text":"I have got to say the food was delicious and the service was extraordinary if you are in Las Vegas and you are looking for a place with good food and awesome customer service I suggest you visit this location they are the best."}
{"text":"I went here for a celebratory dinner, and it worked out beautifully. I only eat chicken so I decided to forgo the meats portion and just get the salad bar... I was glad, because after 1 1/2 passes at the salad bar I was filled to bursting! The other people in my party went nuts over the meats though! The waiters were incredibly friendly, and fellow patrons as well- when our neighbors at the next table found out we were celebrating they sent over a bottle of Moet :) Would definitely come back with more meat-eaters for special occasions.  Oh and P.S., I got the Superfruit Lemonade cocktail (I think that is what it was called), and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"So there I was creeping through the town I made famous when I started to feel that familiar emptiness right underneath where my 8 minute abs would be, if I spent 8 minutes a day on them, but I digress.   I was on the east side of town conducting some quasi business errands that I am going to try and expense and write off my taxes for 2012 as I got thoroughly mugged by the fed and the great state of CA in 2011. I saw when I was driving by that there was a new sign that read Fogo de Chao where Bahama Breeze was the last time I was in the 702 sharing my love for Jesus and putting it down for the west side (the bestside).  Now I am not a wealthy man but through pinching my pennies, shrewd investments, and a 2 hour heater on the craps table the night before I was feeling like a million Argentine Pesos. So I decided to stroll in see what all the unnecessary punctuation in the name of the joint was all about.   I was only slightly put off by the fact that the valet seemed to have taken a smoke break or been called away on some urgent business because there was no one at the stand to toss the keys to the AMG to. I wasn't really in the mood to park my whip myself as I don't park so well when I am famished and let me tell you, I was hungry like a hostage. So I backed up the miracle whip and parked it where I could get out in a hurry should any shenanigans occur. I happen to know for a fact that 2pac got smoked just a block away and I am not trying to put my life in the hands of a degenerate, horse betting trauma surgeon at University Medical Center, nor do I want  Deadmou5 or some other DJ trying to put my lyrics over some hastily crafted beats in some ill fated attempt to cash in on the rush of people to local record shops and itunes to purchase my last album.   As I crept inside there was some goofy looking white kid at the host stand spewing some garbage about how they do there last seating for lunch at 2pm. I glanced at the Swiss timepiece on my wrist and realized that 1) this is one ill watch, and 2) it was 2:06pm. As began to reach in my waist to pistol -whip this kid he blurted out,\"let me check with the manager to see if we can still seat you\".  He returned abruptly and gladly seated us. I was thankful I didn't have to chin check this kid in front of my 2 associates, as well as relieved that my belly would soon be soothed with the arrival of some delicious South American charred animals.   The server came over and greeted us very quickly offered us the wine list and had some drinks flowing pretty quickly. I strolled over to the salad bar where I was delighted to find a mixture of traditional salad bar type accoutrements as well as several other pleasant surprises. I sat down to get busy with my salad as a body like this doesn't happen on its own. It takes prayers, training, vitamins, healthy food choices, a bunch of extreme cardio, and a naturally athletic build that has been referred to as \"the gift\".   All the salad was delicious and I polished it off faster than Whitney Houston goes through her Xanax prescription. I turned over the little poker chip they give you that shows the Gouchos (the guys delivering meat on swords) that I was ready to start putting in work.   After about 6 guys showed up and sliced off delicious cuts of various chicken, pork, beef, and lamb, I was pretty full. Each of them were delectable and unique. I was feeling kind of full but we still had about 1/3 of a bottle of Opus One on the table and even though it was only the 1997, I wasn't prepared to leave it. As one little P.Y. T. came to clear scene of the carnage that was the plates in front of me and my distinguished guests, she ran down the list of desserts. I ordered some incarnation of a chocolate lava cake, my associates ordered the creme brulee and the espresso. All were very good and we were each satisfied. The dessert presentation was tasteful and elegant. When this chick stops blowing up my phone I will try to post a jpg. I need to delete some pics off this thing anyway before my part time lover sees them.    I should mention that the service was impeccable and at no time did I feel rushed, neglected, or what is my biggest pet peeve, hovered over. It was seamless and tactful.   When it was time to return some of the liquor from the night before into Lake Mead the restroom was very clean and it seemed like no one had made number 2 in there all week.   The place was surprisingly reasonable for what you get. Three for lunch with desserts was about $130 before you factor in the wine.  I left feeling satiated and relaxed. The only criticism I have of the place is that when I walked out to my car, there where a couple of chicken heads out there fussing with their hair in the reflection of my Benz. Listen here trick, go inside and use a mirror, not my pearl chariot.   Real talk. This place is good and you should check it out for yourself. Save some cash and go for lunch."}
{"text":"Was there Saturday night for our anniversary.  I have to say \"mediocre\".  Some of the meat was very dry.  Had a hard time getting the meat guys to make it back to edge of the room.  The black bean soup was gone. Was told they would bring some to my table.  That never happen. The lamb shank was tough. The lamb steak was good. All the beef except for the Ribeye was dry   Had to ask for it because it never made it back to us. Out waiter staff was top notch. But for the price.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Ohhh Brazilian food is the BEST!!!! You have to try this place - many locations around the US!  The food is amazing and the staff really nice.   So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Went here today by chance. Was at downtown Summerlin for the farmers market. Was hungry afterwards and wanted to have some lunch. Went there with my husband had excellent service. The food was fantastic. Had a great time. Would go there again in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Really really disappointed. So I thought I've been here before and I have not, so I was excited to try another place in Arizona, even a chain national brand. Let's be positive here first.   The ambience is great, white table cloth, clean environment, everything is looking high end, great, done, woohoo.  We get to the \"salad\" bar. Nothing wrong here, I liked the assortment of cheeses, salads, little sides like olives and the other charcuterie type items were great. My brother told me not to get too much of the salad bar items, I know why. These are just fillers for the real meat. They also bring mashed potatoes and fried plantains (that were terrible).   So my buddy orders a Diet Coke and it's in a glass bottle. Ok cool. Get to that later.  So we get to the \"17 different\" meats. Now if you are vegan, obviously you will not want to go here. So I'm not vegan and we continue to eat. We get the first couple meats and I'm like ok this is pretty good. Different style with the whole skewer type serving. Then we get to some of the other meats like the garlic steak and bacon wrapped chicken/steak and a few others that were absolutely awful. The garlic steak tasted like a fishy taste and I almost threw up in my mouth. It almost ruined my whole meal. The others that I don't even remember were so dry and almost flavorless I was in shock. I asked for most of the cuts with the crust on it to get some flavor and still not exciting. I mean I tried 5-7 different meats and only had one bite of each. I even talked to my brother and he went to one in another state and it was the same issue. Dry, not great flavor, not juicy, and just overall not good experiences. He even told me he didn't want to tell me so I didn't get disappointed, but I did. The best meat was the lamb. The porks were bad and the chicken was dry big time and a few steak items.   The diet cokes. Ok, so our lunch for 2 ppl with no booze was $85 and some of that is because they charged us for 2 cokes because they are in bottles not from the machine. Don't you think you are making enough for mediocre steak that you don't have to charge for each Coke and then ask if we want a refill 20 times in 3 min?? Makes no sense.   Honestly I just don't think it's worth the price and not that great of a product. Probably won't be back, even though I left with a food baby in me."}
{"text":"Came here on a business trip with my wife and son and food was delicious and the server name Norma was fantastic! She made sure we were getting good service and foods are always on our way! Thanks for your help and the friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Our company opened the new year with a bang, or in my case, a severe migraine!  Because our customers are always open and are always working, they demand that we be available as well - even the principals of the company. Holidays are irrelevant as their lack of observance is relative to hemisphere.  I didn't want to go out in the rain, which is unusual for me, but my Beloved was willing to drive wherever to take care of her honey! She figured that great pieces of meat and dessert would quell my migraine. Oh, how she knows me so well.  Since I don't drink alcohol, this would have to do in my case.  A secondary agenda was that I was looking for a nice, upscale place to gift 3 couples that really helped us with our favored charity drives over the holidays. These couples were so instrumental in greatly benefiting two schools for the blind and underprivileged children. And I figured Fogo de Chao would be a great venue to show our appreciation, and present them with their gifts.  With that in mind, my wife navigated through the rain towards this restaurant. She had never eaten here, and the last time that I was here was in 2010 - which is eons ago in restaurant standards.  We were greeted at the door by the selfie taking groups who insisted on such prolonged poses. The effect, as annoying this would've been under any other circumstances, was completely reversed. My wife marveled as to the festive atmosphere that greeted us.  We were promptly seated, and began to partake of the scrumptious dinner that was presented to us.  The salad bar is simply amazing. Except for the green beans which didn't taste that fresh, everything else was just marvelous. I particularly liked the pickled cucumbers, and the massive asparagus (I am an asparagus fan), and the poached eggs.  Additionally, the caramelized bananas and the garlic mashed potatoes were simply sublime.  Then came the meats. My goodness, I thought I went to meat heaven - the ones that we tried were simply savory. I would truly recommend bringing an appetite when dining here, as you will be reaching to flip that chip in no time if you have any less of an appetite.  The Piece de Resistance  for me was the flan for dessert. It was superb. Not too sweet and not too tart. Just perfect. My wife had the chocolate mousse cake, but she didn't like it, and only took a few bites and set it aside.  All in all, at the end of our dining experience, prior to settling the bill, my migraine had completely subsided. Everyone was happy, until I went to the bathroom after settling the bill.  Let me explain...  The bill was $146, and I paid $200 in cash, and my change was approximately $53 and some change.  Because of their server pool, and the perpetual hand off between servers and a lack of interaction with regard to specific details, there had arisen some confusion and miscommunication as to whether or not we paid.  This was exacerbated by the fact that yours truly's policy of tipping for good server is around 30-75+ percent. So, I gave our servers a $50 tip. I left it at the table, and I excused myself and instructed my wife to hand it to one of the servers.  As I returned, and were about to leave, one of our servers (there were several of them) stopped my wife as she was walking through the tables and asked her if she had paid her bill as she was handed this $50 in the bill fold.  Unfortunately, this particular server stopped her and asked this question in the midst of various tables for many of the guests to hear. It was simply uncouth and tactless. Then when my wife clarified that it was a tip, she just proceeded on without any appreciation or gratitude.  Needless to say my wife was mortified, and I had to hear her venting in the car all the way home. And my migraine had summarily returned.  Sadly, on the way out, I was actually going to inquire as to how I could purchase a gift certificate for the three couples that I had previously mentioned. But, after this incident, I will continue to look elsewhere in the myriad of wonderful places throughout the valley.  If this seems petty, it is important to point out that the last time that we encountered such an untoward display was in an upscale Italian restaurant called Iannuzzi, over two decades ago.   Ironically, the issue there was also tip related. This happens so rarely that it really perturbs my wife, who never likes attention drawn to her; especially in an embarrassing manner such as this.  This establishment just needs to work on its communications, and professionalism that should be in keeping with their upscale status. Hence, why I only gave it a 4 star rating, when it really should've been a 5 star. Of course, if my wife had her druthers, it would've been a 1 star but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  To be succinct, the only proper and appropriate response from that server would've simply been... \"Thank You!\"  Enough Said.   Time to get a prescription for Percocet! Not!"}
{"text":"What a great meal!  Everything tasted so good and the meats were just delicious.  Thanks fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"Carnivore glutton!  Loved the fact that I was able to have all my meats rare to medium rare, just the way I like.  Loved the elegance of the restaurant, however I've been to others less elegant that actually have more of a meat selection (seafood included).  The salad bar was good but not outstanding.  Not sure about the price of the meal bc someone else treated.  Not sure that I would return but I'm glad I was able to experience it as people have raved about it."}
{"text":"I like Fogo. I've been to a few across the country. This one is a bit inconsistent.  The other night our cheese bread was old and hard, the salad bar seemed a bit tired and the hostess who seated us was rude.  This is the 2nd time I've eaten here in a couple of months and my first time here was much better.  The meats were all good, the shrimp cocktail was great.  4 people in my party got cheesecake and they were all different sizes and totally different amounts of strawberry topping.  3 of us for the tres leches cake and they were all different sizes and one was almost soupy? Coffee was brought out without cream and spoons.  Just not typical for a Fogo dinning experience.  We came in late (830pm)  so maybe that's why we got the subpar experience.  Hard to say if I'm going to pay this kind of $$ again for another dinner I'm hosting."}
{"text":"We took the family for Thanksgiving.     The service was so terrible it was embarrassing. From the host at the front door, to the people bussing the tables. Couldn't even get the drinks correct, and we only ordered SODA!!!!!    Nobody knew what they were doing, it was SO chaotic and disorganized  it was almost like the employees never worked in the restaurant industry before.  I will NEVER EVER go, or recommend this restaurant to anyone, The price was most definately not worth the lack of service, we would have been better off going to McDonald's.  WORST experience ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was worth every penny! Pricey but oh sooo good! You will definitely enjoy this place.  The salad bar was a clean and nice presentation and always freshly restocked. The selection of meats were incredible and very juicy and tender. The service is excellent. As a matter of fact, one of the servers asked me if I was looking for a particular cut of meat. I was and he sent it right over.   Definitely returning and introducing this place to my husband, since he's a big fan of the \"other\" location. :) I guarantee he will enjoy this Brazillian Steakhouse for sure."}
{"text":"Muito Bom!!! I love Brazilian style steak. Be prepared to eat a lot. Don't waste your time at the salad bar!!"}
{"text":"I'm a steak lover, and fogo did not disappoint. Went for lunch. Salad bar was fresh, clean, and well- stocked. Plenty of side dishes brought to our table. Caipirinhas were amaze balls. And the meat.... Oh my god, the meat! Cooked to perfection. Absolutely would return."}
{"text":"I went to this location last night with my roommate and this time around our experience was not the best.     We searched on google to see what time this place closed and it said 10pm.  We left our house around 9pm and arrived around 9:15pm. (We dont like being the type of people to show up to a place 2 minutes before they close).  I felt like that was a sufficient amount of time to dine without feeling that we were holding the staff hostage and from going home.  I am a server so I know what that feels like.   Diego, our server was very nice and performed his spiel as expected.  He did ask us how we liked our meat cooked and I liked medium rare and my roommate liked medium so we compromised and said medium rare plus.   We were one of theee parties in rhe restauraunt one being a party of 8, the other a party of 4 or 5 and then us, a party of 2.  As soon as we flipped our service cards to green I felt like they were attacking us with cuts of extra well done meat that had been sitting there in the heat furnace for awhile because there weren't many people in the restauraunt.   Once they filled our side plate to capacity in less than 3 minutes, I had to flip my service card over from green to red to stop the meat overload.  Now some people may think this is great service but this felt rushed and they didnt even give us time to let the flavors of the meat marinate in our mouths.    The Gaucho kept circling around our table with meat in his hand as if he was a vulture waiting for its prey.  This made us feel kind of uncomfortable because it sent the message to us that we needed to hurry up because they were closing soon and they didnt want to be there one minute past 10.  When we flipped our service card back to green, the attack of the meats began again to the point where I could not even distinguish the different types on our plates.  We flipped it back to red and he kept bringing more like they wanted us to hurry up!  I didn't complain because I did not want to enforce the stereotype that black people complain about everything and that we don't tip.  I'm a server and can attest to \"serverism\" - servers discriminating or assuming certain ethic groups dont tip nor have any type of class.  I did mention in a tactful way to Diego that the meat was a \"little overcooked.\" And he did offer to re prepare whatever meats we wanted at the temperature requested..thats the only reason why I am giving this two stars.  Despite the rushed service and overcooked meat, we still left a $28 tip (23%) when I really wanted to tip 15 to 18 percent but I'm still trying to fight the stereotypes that black people don't tip correctly.   I probably wont come here again just riding on this last experience despite me coming here for my birthday a few months ago and when the restauraunt was packed.  The service should have not felt so rushed especially when they werent even closed yet."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Brazilian steakhouse in Vegas. The service is great, the meat comes in a wide variety, from sirloin to filet mignon, from lamb chops to lab of lamb, it truly is a carnivores paradise. First time I went there, I was in awe at the selection; soo many choices! Second time I went there, I tried the salad bar, and wow is it nice!  However, my problem with the place came with my third visit...the bartender didn't seem competent at his job and made my friend and her mom and dad some terrible tasting Caipirinhas (three different ones). Via Brazil wins in this category.  Overall, fogo is excellent, will most definitely come back...but I won't be ordering a Caipirinha if that same bartender is there (or hasn't learned how to make drinks properly)."}
{"text":"This is a definite 5 star place. You will not find better service or food than this place.  I have been here twice for special occasions and they really take care of you.  And, not just the server, but everyone in the restaurant is attentive to your needs. I wish all restaurants were this way. We tried all the meats and they were all flavorful.  I especially enjoyed the house sirloin and the flank. If you want a great experience or to celebrate an occasion, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"You like meat? You came to the right place. 15 different cuts of meat. All of them are really good. Each one is cooked perfectly, the servers even ask which part you'd like and they'll slice off a piece for you. Filet mignon is outstanding. But my favorite was the rib eye.   The salad bar seemed average, but it's good enough for a prelude to the meat extravaganza.   The servers were nice and our waitress was really engaging and not in a fake way either.   Would come back here for special events. It's on the pricier side but that's what you do for special events. I wouldn't eat here everyday, my cardiologist would be disappointed and I don't have a cardiologist."}
{"text":"As far as brazilian steakhouse goes, Fogo de Chao is probably my favorite here in town. I tend to find that Texas De Brazil's meat is too salty, but here at Fogo de Chao it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. And hands down they have the best cheese bread. They are light and cheesey and just bread perfection.  The salad bar also has a wide selection, comparable to the other places in town. Another stand out feature is that they have fried polenta as a side dish-.they were crispy little sticks of fried goodness. Tastes similar to a fried potato- just genius."}
{"text":"The service upon arrival was great, waited at the bar for our table! Then the 3 star happens, got to our table and ordered drinks, started on the buffet fresh mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes, but then we got our drinks an hour later because our waiter forgot! That was a major fail! Can't complain about the meets at all, the dishes were delicious and the bread was amazing! Very limited drinks, no craft beer selection, weird for Las Vegas and very expensive! Beautiful ambiance but the named few fails make this a big fat 3 star!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Our server disappeared and we waited for our check. It was almost closing time and the workers started eating the leftovers. Not enough choices for my taste in the salad bar. The server described meats served but we barely saw the lamb or ribs."}
{"text":"I can some this up in one phrase: First class eating contest! Our Brazilian waiter comes over and says go to the salad bar all you want. You want more, get more! Then he says the meat will come around and they give it to you. You want more get more! It was like a revolving train of meat sticks. The food was superb and the service was impeccable. I can't wait to go to the one in Miami."}
{"text":"I forgot what it was like to eat at a Brazilian steakhouse compared to all the buffets I've consumed. This was a real meat-fest. Lots of meat, meat, and more meat on the plate. Prime rib, sirloin, filet, chicken, pork - out of the churrascarias I've been to, I think Fogo's has the best meat (it's seasoned just right and tastes very good).  I think the attractive part of Fogo's is the meat. I was not impressed by the salad bar. Though it was presented clean and beautifully, there weren't that many selections to choose from. (Just some cold cuts, cheese, asparagus spears, potato salad, some rice, and beans). There was no fruit or other deliciousness.  The meal came with complimentary mashed potatoes, polenta, and pão de queijo. I enjoyed the warm goodness of the pão de queijos the most.   Come here if you're looking mostly to dine on tasty meats. If you want appetizers or other side dishes, or even a salad bar with more offerings, go elsewhere. As it is, though Fogo's has the best churrascaria meats so far, I'm not sure it was worth the price (pretty expensive - $28.50 + tax per person for lunch)."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Visited Fogo in two separate occasions within the past two weeks and I've been completely blown away by their meat selection, huge fresh salad bar and their fantastic service. Other Brazilian steakhouses in town are good, but this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Lunch is a little slower and actually pretty affordable, considering what you are getting. So I'd recommend going at lunch time. It's the same menu for both, so you're not missing out.  Both the salad bar and the main meat entree were delicious. Each for different reasons. Salad bar had so much fresh produce, including some smoked meats which were tasty. And the main entree selections were fantastic. The parmesan pork and top sirloin were my favorites. They had many options to choose from though and, more importantly, did not keep you waiting for food to come out.  I think their signature house juice is the limeade. My girlfriend loved it, I could have used something a little fruitier though, but that's my taste. It was very sweet and made a nice contrast to the salty meats. Wine or one of their cocktails would probably go well too, but it was hot and we were dehydrated."}
{"text":"We came here as a party of 13 for Thanksgiving, we come to Fogo quite often. We love the gourmet salad bar and the experience of a Brazilian steakhouse. It's super fun to try all the different meats and not get full on just one. Service was spotty on Thanksgiving, they were very busy, I get that but we could barely get water and ice tea refills. At one point, my husband walked over to the bussing station and grabbed the water pitchers and ice tea pitchers and filled our drinks. (This was after waiting a good 15 mins with no one coming back) And it was difficult to get meat! It seemed as if they didn't want to come over to our big party! A manager did come towards the end and ask us what we wanted and he was able to get the guys to bring the pork ribs and ribeye. Towards the end a server named Eric came and started taking care of our table and he WAS AWESOME! I was thankful he took over . On a day other than a holiday, service is great , the food and experience are awesome and the managers are attentive as well. The holiday was just too busy for them."}
{"text":"Good luck finding out how much the meal cost until you get the bill. So its $50 per person but its worth the price. You can basically stuff yourself until your pants button shoots off like those subway commercials. I would love to come back if I was ever in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Meatlover's paradise! I've been to a few Brazilian steakhouses but I was really impressed with both the service and the food. If you go, GO HUNGRY!!! I know you're supposed to go there for the meat but the fried bananas and the cheesy bread puffs are sooo amazingly good, I have a hard time staying away from those. After working my way through a wide variety of meats, I left in a meat stupor. The meat, by the way was delicious. Quite a big variety of meats, cuts and they were all flavored really well. The service is really fast."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao is excellent. Service is wonderful. Food is awesome. It's a little pricey. Lunch for two, with tip, appx. $90.00"}
{"text":"First off I have to preface this review with I'm not a huge meat eater, so why did I come here you ask? Work Xmas party, and I've heard a lot of buzz on this place, so I thought I'd give it a try. I was going to just get the salad bar at first, but at $22 a person, I might as well try the entire experience for $45. I wasn't impressed with the salad bar, I think I've had a better selection at Sweet Tomatoes, so that was a letdown. Then the meat started coming, and it was like meat overload. Nothing really was spectacular, honestly the only piece of meat I liked was the lamb. The best part of my experience here was the 3 caipirinhas.   For dinner and 3 cocktails, my bill was $110. Really? Not a chance I would ever go back and spend that again, for that kind of money I will go to a restaurant on the strip.   I gave one star for service, they were on top of it. And another star for the food not being bad. Guess this place just wasn't my thing."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the meal. Service was great!  I do however feel really annoyed that a small piece of meat that I couldn't finish ( that I wanted to take home to my dog ) I was told NO!  I understand a buffet type place not letting people load up a Togo box. However this was farrrrrr from that. Just a bit tacky the story as to why.   I was told that they couldn't be held responsible if the food made my dog sick.  Lol. If it will make my dog sick. Then why did I eat it?!?   Not wanting to tear them as if was a good dining experience. However I was annoyed."}
{"text":"I came here for a wedding reception. There were only 8 of us, so it wasn't a big party.  The restaurant had very few guests and there was plenty of free tables , so I'm not sure why they smooshed 8 of us on one small circular table. A slightly larger table could have been accommodated but the request was denied.        I think because everything was paid in advance, the service lacked some. The party arrived at 1:40pm and we were told the buffet area closed at 2:00pm. ( we did have reservations, they knew we were coming). We had to rush to get our food and we ended up with slim pickings.   Most of the items on the salad/ buffet bar were very  picked through or all out. They were not refilled or replaced. This was very disappointing. I feel bad for the bride and groom because they pad a lot of money for this buffet and the items were no longer fresh or replaced.   I did like the the meats. The meat is brought to you at your table and is very fresh and flavorful. The deserts were also very fresh and good.  I don't think I'd come back here. Someone's wedding reception should be treated better especially since they are paying top dollar per head."}
{"text":"1st Visit 2014 Amazing 2nd Visit 2015 June for my Bday. This place is beautiful, we went for lunch. They really treat you like absolute royalty. There were three of us, we ate and ate and ate, all of the employees were absolutely A+++, Ambiance, Service, Food A+++. I got a free desert. We walked out of there ... the agreement was \"and this is how it feels to be a king for two hours\". If only more of the standard restaurants can learn from the excellence that Fogo delivers."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night, walked in with a reservation, the place was packed and so loud. Had to squeeze through tables to get to our table that was so close to the table next to us we could have joined in their conversation. My bad for not knowing that there is no menu. The meal consists of salad bar that's can't even compare with a Sweet Tomatoes, and then the second course is meat, and meat, and more meat. I guess if you want dry chicken wrapped in bacon that's okay, they also have sausages, flank steak, rib eye, pork and filet. But for the most part our table saw lots of chicken, flank steak, sirloin that had way too much salt on it. We did manage a thin sliver of rib eye, and when we had to ask for horseradish it took a long time to get it. The desert, they do offer several choices. We had key lime pie, not exceptional just okay.  Okay then the kicker, the bill came for four of us it was 389.00 without tip, I know what your thinking, and no, we only had one drink per person.  So I rate them just two stars, if you want to try it make sure you know how much it costs."}
{"text":"This place is divine. I absolutely loved the polenta fries and plantains. Their salad bar is incredible too, try the brown sugar pepper bacon. Don't ignore the bread rolls on the table til the last minute like I did, they have a surprise inside. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"This place does it for me, a meat lovers paradise! Great service and a fun dining experience. Like the lower sirloin and the house special.   Perfect for meat lovers that want to eat all you want and have a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"Our waters were never below 3/4 full the meat was always hot every time it's nice not to be half way through a steak and it gets cold on you this place allows you to always eat a hot piece I love that! The waiters work as a TEAM that's amazing! We were asked multiple times by the people cutting the meat if we wanted a specific cut, and within 3 minutes he was back cutting it for us! 5 Star Service through and through! Sign up for their eClub our bill went from $74 to $43 TOTAL FOR TWO for lunch due to being able to use 2 coupons for the table according to the fine print! That's cheap for amazing flavor and prime cut steak and chicken not to mention the market table! The waiters deserve every ounce of a 25% tip VERY IMPRESSED"}
{"text":"I know there are a lot of reviews on yelp that Fogo to choa is better than Texas de Brazil, but the fact is Texas de Brazil still gets five stars. The salad bar at Fogo to choa was great, the food is fresh, the steak is juicy and wonderful, and the service is amazing, however it still isn't Texas de Brazil. Texas de Brazil Has way better cheese bread,and the steak is more salty and juicy. The salad bar at Fogo to choa again is fresh and has lots of options, however doesn't have the flavor of Texas De brazil, it is missing the grape salad  and other cold salads, the dressings aren't as good either. All this being said this Resteraunt is still amazing and I would still go again. I enjoyed the ambiance and since I went for Mother's Day the management gave a gift to all mothers of three free meals (dinner or lunch )! Very nice touch. This Resteraunt is definitely worth trying. But for the money TDB can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Oh boy! talk about some quality \"meat\" dining experience. I went on a Sunday night, my friend and i are huge meat eaters, so we were ready to devour the place. The staff were really friendly and immediately seated us and told us \"remember try to pace yourself\", come on!? really!? i have conquered steaks after steaks who do u think you are talking to!? ( so i thought), let me just say that if you are not ready, keep your little coaster on the red side, because all the tender goodness are practically flying to your table, if you don't pace urself, you are gonna get dominated by the juicy goodness plates after plate.   I personally enjoyed every rack of meat they brought in front of us, the chicken was so so, but ..well it's chicken.   I was pretty impressed by their salad bar, the produce were fresh and delicious, if i want ready to eat an entire cow, i can definitely hangout at their salad bar all day.   Over all it was a very fulfilling and pleasant experience."}
{"text":"If you like consuming copious amounts of meat, then you will love Fogo de Chao. You begin with a salad bar that has enough veggies, fruits, meats, and cheeses to squash your appetite, but don't fill up your plate here because the good stuff is yet to come. I limit myself to a small salad with some mozzarella and manchego cheese. Once you return to your seat, you flip over a card to the green side to indicate you're ready for the proteins, at which point a parade of meat-wielding servers entice you with a variety of selections and cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and lamb that they methodically slice from a skewer on to your plate. When you've had enough, you flip your card back over to red. They also bring mashed potatoes, polenta, caramelized bananas, and these delicious, cheesy dinner rolls, which I just learned are gluten-free. I have been to the Indianapolis location many times and recalled the potatoes and polenta being better than what I had most recently in Las Vegas. The potatoes had no flavor and the polenta tasted like it had sat out for a couple hours before arriving at our table. One other issue I had was that I requested the bacon-wrapped filet mignon four (4) times - count 'em! - before someone finally came around with 3 small pieces for our group of 30 and well after I'd finished everything else on my plate. I get that it's a popular cut, but we spent several thousand dollars that evening so I don't know why they were being stingy with it. The chocolate mousse cake was excellent. All-in-all, it's a 4 star experience and a bit on the pricey side so make sure you go in hungry."}
{"text":"Definitely not for vegetarians!  At Fogo you eat meat, on top of meat, and then more meat.  But not only is the food excellent, the experience is fun as well.  It's on the fancier side and definitely expensive, but it's great for special occasions or to treat yourself occasionally.  I loved the parmesan crusted pork, the linguisa, and the sirloin was very good too.  I was surprised that the bacon wrapped filet was very fatty but overall the quality of the meat was amazing.  The salad bar was very fresh and tasty and the tres leches cake for dessert is definitely one to try."}
{"text":"Love this place  Last time we came over they were out of a lot of things  But the food is still good  The service is amazing  The drinks are the best  Clean fun and nice atmosphere Prices are not too bad  Just need to make sure you coming ready to eat a lot"}
{"text":"This place is the same concept as Texas De Brazil if you ever had it. Regardless, this place is outstanding! Very clean and the servers were top notch. My favorites were the filet mignon, lamb, and garlic sirloin. If you decide to go here, I suggest you go around late lunch timeframe, not only because it's less busy but you'll be super stuffed and you won't want dinner - this covers both meals for the day. Heck, you'd probably won't want to eat again until 2 days afterwards. Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"This is a great location. Service and food is the best FDC. They were very prompt with getting you the meats/cuts you wanted. Made sure you were not with an empty plate.    Plenty of parking too. No need to valet."}
{"text":"I have been to a few different Brazilian steak houses before, but this was my first time here.  We went to celebrate a couple birthdays with a group of 8 people.  The service and atmosphere is what earned both stars. The only complaint in this department was when I went to the rest room, a service tray was leaning against the wall less than a foot from the urinal. Pretty gross for a crappy diner let alone a nice evening out.  The food was not worth the cost at all. All meats, except the sirloin, were way over cooked. The carver would ask how you would like the meat cooked, and we quickly learned your response did not matter. Dry and well done was what you got. My wife is pregnant so only soda for her, and one glass of wine for me. $148 total including a 20%tip. Not worth it at all. I will not return, and recommend looking elsewhere for a good Brazilian steakhouse."}
{"text":"One word. Picanha.  Kept the green card up for slices upon slices of the perfectly seasoned sirloin.  The endless salad bar was a great compliment to the choices of meat.  The bread and plaintains were worth the carb overload!  Our meat carvers were friendly and great with the kids.  Came on a Saturday for lunch and wasn't too crowded.  Make an opentable reservation to earn those extra points!"}
{"text":"Awesome dinner. Service and food was exceptional. This place is a must try. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go here on a date night, and it's not a place to take someone out for business, but if you have a family of hungry teenaged boys then it's the perfect spot for a birthday dinner.    The interior design is just okay, a couple steps up from a cafeteria.  But that's not the reason you are there.  The reason you are there is the all-you-can-eat meats.  And if you have sons, they will eat your money's worth.   I've read some reviews, and yes the steak is not the same as Mastro's.  Who's expecting that?  The steak and other meats are decent, and given how fast my kids were eating, I am not sure whether they tasted anything anyway.  And while some reviews cite poor service, ours was really good.  The restaurant operates under a team concept, so you have multiple servers.  A couple servers were especially good.  If you are sick of Benihana, and you're looking for a more upscale all-you-can-eat buffet for teens, this is your place."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  I lean strongly to the carnivorous, so the endless array of different meats (all perfectly cooked and loaded with flavor) are nirvana for me.  My wife usually just gets the salad bar, which she calls the best she has ever had.  I like the salad bar too, but I try to go light on the salads so as to leave more room for the scrumptious steak, pork, lamb, and chicken.  We usually come for lunch, so that we have the several hours necessary to digest this feast.  (No need for dinner after lunch at Fogo.)"}
{"text":"Try to make this quick: - YES it is as good as everyone says - YES service is over the top amazing - YES sirloin is the best - YES cheese balls are, well amazballs - YES salad bar is the best ever  But here are the suggestions: - don't over indulge in salad bar (it is there to fill you up on purpose) - same with the cheese balls - SLOW DOWN. Cos if you come famished like we did, you fill up and are in and out in an hour   It may look expensive, but when you add in your appetizer and sides (which are included) it is the same as any $$$$ restaurant."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a lot of good food and a place that will take care of you, go here. We had a group of 12 and they  accommodated us without a hitch."}
{"text":"I went with my husband on a Monday night, so we had no issue getting a table despite not having reservations.  The concept was explained to us immediately upon being seated (you have a coaster-like card in front of you- when you flip the green side up, the meat starts coming (!), and when you turn it over to the red side, the meat stops), but we had dined at a Brazilian Steakhouse prior.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars, is because I can't help but compare it to Braza, in Connecticut, which I give five starts all-around, but at Fogo, you will not leave disappointed.  The salad bar was fresh, the meat kept coming, we received the meat exactly the way we requested (medium-rare to medium), and dessert was on the house.  I had ordered an iced tea, and they even came around with a pitcher and continuously topped it off.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy crap!! This place is amazing! Me and the hubbie were in Vegas a couple weeks ago and we decided to dine at this restaurant. The food was delicious...the staff were amazing. Everyone were so attentive, they actually stopped at our table to talk to us. The manger and chef made their way to us as well.   Our bill came out to $220 that included drinks and tips...so worth it! It was an amazing experience for both of us. We both enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a convention and a college suggested we drop in for lunch. Staff was very attentive and the restaurant is impeccable. The choices of meats are a carnivores delight. The food would have been a bit more enjoyable if they mind how much salt is added to the meat. I am a regular guy who doesn't mind salt, but man they really over did it. Other that being heavy handed on the salt, I would probably go back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I always know that the best way to bring a smile to my wife's face is to take her to a churrascaria. We were on our way to Texas de Brasil when I said, \"You know, Fogo is closer; why don't we try there?\" I'm glad I did.   Let's start with the service. Even though they were fairly busy, we never had to wait for a waiter to come by. The drinks refilled almost as if by magic, and everyone was friendly and nice, and happy to give suggestions as to what is their favorite part on the menu. The manager, Ricard, came by to introduce himself, and chatted for a while. We definitely felt like valued, important guests. It was like the experience you get when you're a regular at other places. So, I liked that.  Their salad bar is better, in my opinion, than that of TdB. More selections, and what was on it just tasted better. If my wife wouldn't have glared at me all night for blowing $50 on a salad bar and the fried bananas, I'd have just stuck with that, and been pretty happy.   The meats were all really good. (She seemed to love them, at least.) There's fewer meat selections than where we were heading, but the stuff was all cooked perfectly. I even enjoyed the leg of lamb, which is surprising, since I see lamb as a form of punishment. One of the servers told us of some off-menu items to try, and those were amazingly good.  Well worth the money."}
{"text":"Get ready to indulge in meat galore! I had to try this restaurant after eating at Texas de Brazil to determine which steakhouse would be in my favor and I must there weren't any outstanding differences. I highly recommend to come with an empty stomach! The service was absolutely great. The entire staff was attentive and accommodating. The quality of the food was phenomenal; although, the salad/appetizer bar didn't have too much to offer in my opinion. Also, the piece of filet mignon I was given was a bit dry. The top sirloin was my favorite. It's the most popular cut and it definitely speaks for itself. If you join the e-club for this restaurant you receive $15 off of your bill on a weekday! I would definitely come back, it's a great place for a celebratory dinner or any special occasion."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! Love the concept of an all-you-can-eat Brazilian steakhouse. I recommend making reservations if you are planning to come here, but they won't seat you until your entire party is present. This place is great for groups. And I love the red light/green light system so no one is bothering you for more food when you're not ready and you stay seated for protein and a selection of sides. Just remember to turn over your card as needed. You only get up for the salad bar. The selection is okay. This is a great way to celebrate someone or spend time with family and friends with great food. And definitely come with a big appetite. A couple things though - there was one meat I was dying to have and even had to have a waitress call them over and they still never came. Eventually over time I became too full to have it when I was asked if I still wanted it. For the price, I'm not sure if I ate as much as it's worth so beware of that. Don't come here if you don't appreciate high quality, perfectly seasoned meat or if you're a picky eater. On a good note, they give complimentary full-sized dessert for birthdays if you tell your server. This place was really good but probably a one-time thing for me."}
{"text":"Took my parents last Sunday. We are regulars at Texas Do Brazil so I was like lets try it at lunch time... so the price is not crazy. Got Brunch pricing :( forgot Sundays means Brunch not Lunch 5mns away from the strip  Parking space is large. When we walked to the restaurant someone Opened it for us and then the host took us to a table right away. The room was little too dark, restaurant was elegant. The person in charge of our table \"introduced us\" to the Brazilian BBQ. Glasses of water got served couple minutes later. The \"salad bar\" was ok. I Love that they had fresh cuts of fruits like papaya, pineapple, fresh berries! that was a YEAHHH  The selection wasn't as festive as Texas De Brazil. Then the ballet of meats arrived. Their sausage were Yummy and I got the Filet Mignon and some lamb shop. Meat was juicy and good per my mom :) I wasn't impressed by it, I feel like the choice was \"limited\".  What was the Best to me Your meal will be serviced with fried bananas (was perfectly fried and sweet little caramelized no sugar added or cinnamon), fried polenta, mashed potato, cheese puff  Fresh fruits cuts EXCELLENT  Party of 4, $211 on a Sunday brunch... I tried but my heart stuck with Texas De Brazil"}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat delicious cuts of meat at the perfect medium-rare temperature served and sliced right it front of you. My tastebud and tummy were very happy. This place is located in the very beautiful downtown summerlin shopping area. The quality of the meats were very good and spiced perfectly. The service was very good, especially by our waiter, Minh. They were very attentive and polite.   Only complaint I'd have to say is with the selection of food at the salad bar. I truly did not care for much of the salads or cheeses ... which is not like me since I love both. But the amazing tres leches dessert I had at the end might have made up for that a little."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several Brazilian Steak Houses in the past. When walking in this establishment, first impression is good decor. The food was reasonable , but the service was way off base from start to finish. Example..  Given a crappy table when other good tables were available, the place was 40 precent full when we arrived. I should have called em on it.  It took 30 to 40 mins for someone to ask us for a drink ? I had to ask for drinks.  A full drink menu was not supplied. Only expensive cocktail's. I wanted a beer, but that was a verbal process.  After ordering drinks, 20 to 25 mins and nothing. Again I had to ask where our drinks were. Remember this place was not busy.  Drinks came when we were 70 percent thru the meal !!!  I had to ask for the desert menu. At least 50 percent of the items were not available !!! We ordered three times as each of the items became unavailable.  We didn't have a dedicated server. Just random people filling our drinks and desert order.  The staff appeared unrefined, although the guys serving the meat appeared to have their act together.  400 dollar bill with tip and I felt I could have gotten better service at McDonald's. When I left I was bemused. Not recommended, I will not return."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty tasty. Service was just okay.   We've been to Texas de Brazil a few times and thought we'd try Fogo. Overall, I thought Fogo was not as good. Meat was slow to come out at times. Waiters with meat skipped over some family members not asking if they wanted whatever meat they were serving. This happened several times. Other times, waiters would just skip our table entirely. Walking around and checking other tables, but walking past ours, even though green cards are up.   Salad bar area was good, but not as extensive as TDB.  Give a choice between the two, I'd pick TDB over Fogo."}
{"text":"Since am half Brazilian this is my place to go and eat it's  all-around great place to eat and you do pay a little extra for it.  The ambience is upscale.  The service is attentive.  The cold dishes are delicious and very fresh.  The meats are excellent.  They have lots varieties of meat you might want to try your favorites first.  Either way,  love the place"}
{"text":"Great food at this overload of a restaurant.  You definitely need to come here a couple of times before you get the hang of things.  The salad bar is great and all the meat was perfectly cooked.  Since it was my first time here and I was so enamored with all of the beautiful cuts running around, I didn't slow down, and relax as much as I should have.   On the other hand, Manny Ramirez of the LA Dodgers was sitting at the table directly next to us so that was pretty cool.  The bacon wrapped fillet was the best bite I had all night.  I kept taking more every time that particular Gaucho came around.  The staff here is excellent accomadating my request for rice at no charge.  They also have a beautiful chimichurri sauce that you can ask for as well.  My only gripe of the meal, and I do mean only, was the fact that they charged me $18 for a glass of lemoncello at the end of the meal.  That is ridiculous, especially if my father in laws Grand Marnier was only $6.50.  The lemoncello was a $28 bottle, so I can't comprehend where they got the nerve to charge so much.  Other than that, Saud, Fogo de Chao! Wonderful job on your fabulously different take on the classic steak house."}
{"text":"As you walk in, the service is prompt and friendly. Its a laid back, upscale and relaxing ambiance. The dimmed lighting make it a nice inviting atmosphere for a romantic date. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. They have many different types of meats which include beef, lamb, chicken, pork...everything a meat lover wants. They even have a robust salad bar as well. With the meal they also give sides of cheese bread, mashed potatoes, fried bannas and polenta. You can eat your fill and be satisfied for the rest of the day! Lastly, the Tres Leches Cake is to die for."}
{"text":"First time dining here... definitely will be returning! Not only was everything exceptional (and plentiful), but the staff is amazing as well! Marco made special recommendations (taking my food allergies into consideration) and accommodations; server Vanessa took great care of us, and brought me a list of allergens in regards to each of the food items offered. Many other dining establishments I have been to have a diminished amount of options available, or the server is unsure if soy is present, or in what capacity (ie - an ingredient that can be omitted vs a marinade that has been infused). Marco even offered to prepare each of the meat options that typically are prepared with ingredients containing soy in a different way so that I could still enjoy the variety. They have a red/green card system for when you would like to have the Gauchos bring around meats and you can visit the buffet as often as you would like.  From appetizers to salads, veggies to meats, breads and fruits, and even desserts... all was fresh and flavorful.  And Marco prepared the best (and prettiest) Chilean Sea Bass with a mango topping plated with asparagus for me, along with the freshest crème brûlée I have ever tasted. Bellisimo!!"}
{"text":"This is a usual Brazilian steakhouse. It's very upscale. Don't fill up on the salad bar though, because once you turn over your coaster from red to green, your place will be FULL of succulent meats from tasty animals! Chicken, beef, lamb, pork OH MY! Make sure you are good and hungry before arriving. All of the cuts of meat could be cooked the way you want it (rare-well). We went here to celebrate my boyfriend's college graduation and the servers brought him out a fancy and free dessert.   You can get all the good cuts of meat and salad bar at lunchtime for less money than dinner time. This place is pretty cut and dry. Nothing special except the flavor of the meat, though for that only, I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"50.00 is very cheap for most restaurants. But not for this place all the meats are dry and low quality cuts. I tried every single thing on the menu everything I ordered of course extra rare and still dry. The lamb had good flavor and was best. Salad bar has nice options. Service was very good atmosphere nice as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Fogo many times in Phoenix and most of the time our experience has been really great. The food is amazing and the service is also nice. Don't forget to try the desert wine cart where you can get one of the best deals on sauternes in the Valley.  My only complaint comes from our experience on Valentine's Day where we did indeed have reservations and they were running more than 2 hours behind. Overall, i'd say a great bet for a meal in Phoenix - and certainly your best bet for any annoying friends that are still playing the Atkins diet card."}
{"text":"As a fellow server, i have to say, i am one hard beast to tame! That said, this is BY FAR!! The best restaurant i have EVER been to! Not only is the service impeccable, but the food is outta this freaking world!!! If I'm Vegas, you'd be sorry to miss this joint! And ask for Carlos!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Fogo and it was a special outing for a graduating friend. I must say that I was concerned about strict dress codes since we both wore shorts - 98 degree weather outside. A few meats were on the dry side, but that's to be expected, mostly small cuts, chicken and one pork item. The beef stood out, specifically the house specials. The market fresh salad bar is very generous and well-stocked and I know not to fill up on those goodies before I have a chance to taste some of the meats. I will make Fogo my monthly outing from now on.   The staff is helpful and they're always on hand if you have questions or have special requests. The dessert portions are gargantuan, so you can share one dessert with your significant other. Their drink selection surpasses most places I have patronized in the past, although we settled for Guarana.   This has been hands down the best experience I have had at any select restaurant in Arizona, bar none. I have traveled around the country and around the world, and I am a gourmet chef with three decades experience - also taught gourmet cooking classes, and I must say that I have never had better service, even at places costing five times as much. Before you waste time and money at mediocre shops, try this first!"}
{"text":"It was my first night of a long awaited vacation and. Friend suggested this place for dinner.   I had no idea what the food was like here or anything about the restaurant.  Silly me should have checked yelp!     I met him at the restaurant and he explained Brazilian Steakhouse to me.  Said to ask for small pieces so I could try everything!  I told him o was starving so this would be a great treat considering this was my first meal in 12 hours!   The waiter explained the \"button\". Turn it over to have the servers come and flip it to stop.  They offered us a visit to the \"salad bar\" which was loaded with tasty treat. Mushrooms, olives, salad, salami etc.  I could have gotten full just eating that!  I returned to my seat and the treat began.   all types of meat and sausages were brought to us on skewers.  The first few skewers I just had the server slice me a normal size and my friend warned me..small pieces!     I lost track of how many different meats we ate all prepared and sliced differently.  Everything they brought was incredibly delicious!  The lamb, the ribeye, cowboy steak etc...just an amazing sensory delight on the tongue!   I had seconds on the sausage as it was so perfectly cooked and seasoned.   I had thirds on the ribeye!!     I've already recommended this to place to three friends heading to Vegas!  Definitely worth the drive from the strip and the mall itself a great visit!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy. You can't beat the price. The food is decent but it took all night for the filet to come out and that's all I really wanted. By the time it was available we had already been dining for an hour on less desirable meats."}
{"text":"From start to finish this was the best experience! The wait staff was so friendly and fast. We were discussing my birthday, and they brought me a special dessert just to be sweet. The food was incredible and didn't all have the same smokey flavor (most brazilian steakhouses have the same taste). The buffet and sides were perfect, and complimented the wonderful food. The money is well worth it, I would pay that every day to receive that kind of service. I love this place, and I recommend it for any occasion."}
{"text":"First off...they're getting one star for cheesy bread.  That's it.  Horrible service tonight for our group.    Where do I begin.  Took 15 minutes to receive our bottle of wine along with another 10 minute wait for our bottle of water.   Meats were tasty for about the 15 minutes when we received them.  After that the meats stopped coming around even though our cards were up on green.  The meat jockey's were still walking around but seemed to ignore our table.  The table next to us also received the \"salad bar\" treatment.    Really disappointed in the service as I had been waiting for this dining experience for a few weeks now.  Decided while waiting twenty minutes for the check that I will probably not return."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had.   50 per person well worth the price.  All food had great flavor. Fried bananas were amazing.  Salad bar was amazing.  Bartender was great.  Gave us a great wine suggestion and very friendly.  Can't say enough great things about this place.  Planning my next visit already."}
{"text":"This is a buffet, which is not something I prefer often.  But--- this is an exception. Though I don't eat here often is always a great indulgence to feast at the huge salad and side dish bar before being served at your table with all kinds of meats. The salad bar has Italian meats, cheeses, Fruits, vegetables, Ceasar Salad,  etc. They'd even rice and beans and a few soups.  Then when you are ready,  flip your circle over from red to green and the professional servers begin appearing Weyerhaeuser chicken, pork,  filet and lamb.   Go slow!  And flip the little circle to red to stop the servers from coming by while you enjoy.  Only choose what you want.  If you've never been,  I'd say go!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! The salad/cheese bar was so fresh and there was many options. The meat was so good and they brought it right to your table, there was a few meats that were on the drier side, mostly the chicken but other than that it was excellent. The drinks are strong but yummy. The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because we were here celebrating an anniversary (as many are celebrating something) we could hardly have a conversation, every 4 minutes an employee would ask how everything is, if we need anything. This wasn't the meat carvers doing this, it was just too much. Asking once is good with me and if I need something I will let you know. It kind of just got old after a while, I know they want to make sure everyone is taken care of but if they would give you more privacy while eating I would give this place 5 stars"}
{"text":"Nothing better than an ever rotating selection of meat on giant skewers! The market table was well stocked and kept tidy. Everything tasted great and the servers were all super attentive. Minh was especially helpful and made our experience even better. This location is beautiful and, in my opinion, better than the Flamingo one. Will definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"One of a kind experience! The food was amazing, the staff was very kind and attentive and the place was clean and neat.  I would recommend that you check this place out at least one time! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place - awesome food, friendly, courteous servers and prompt service..... this place is highly recommended! Would definitely come back when I'm in LV."}
{"text":"Good food and good prices, but wasn't the best Brazilian steakhouse I've ever been to.  The service was good, and the salad bar was exceptional.  I'll likely come back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Saw this place while at the Habit Grill yesterday and made immediate plans to check it out! We decided to go today on the lunch special ($34.95 for the full churrasco experience) . Lunch hours are held from 11:30 am- 2:00 pm.  Made reservations online and was at the door when they opened!  Salad Bar (5/5) So many fresh and tasty options! Their caesar salad was fantastic! Also enjoyed the fresh pineapple, salami, peppered and smoked bacon, and asparagus! Countless options available at their salad bar!  Sides (5/5) Cheese bread balls are like crack! Seriously. Very habit forming and addicting! Mashed potatoes were savory as well!   Also enjoyed the fried bananas to cleanse the palette!  Meats (5/5) Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Enjoyed so many savory, tasty meats! Lamb chops, fillet mignon, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, sausage, and bacon wrapped filet mignon just to name a few! The filet mignon was my favorite, with the flank steak a close second!  What stood out to us was how flavorful the meats tasted. At the only other Brazilian Steakhouse I have been to recently (*Texas*cough*Texas*), their meats tasted too salty. So much so that it really took away from the whole thing. Not here at Fogo! Meats were delicious and full of flavor! Cooked and seasoned superbly!  Service (5/5) Seriously, some incredibly attentive and friendly service! Wildly impressed by how we were treated by everyone, from the first person we saw and spoke to all the way to the very last person we saw and spoke to! All were friendly, personable, and accommodating!  This was such a fantastic experience that we have plans to bring some of our friends here to share this great place with!  Can't wait to come back!  5 stars.  Woohoo! As good as it gets!"}
{"text":"This is the Fogo De Chao located in Downtown Summerlin, actually right next to Public School 702.  We came here last night with some awesome friends to celebrate a birthday. We loved our experience at the Flamingo location so much that we wanted to share a like experience with them on this special occasion.  It was alright. It definitely was not nearly as good as experience at the Flamingo location back in April, but it wasn't terrible either.  (+) We came in on a special promotion. For $30 at lunch or $40 for dinner, you would have All you can eat at the salad bar, plus all you can eat to 8 select meats, plus 1 choice of desert. This is WELL worth the price and only runs through the rest of August. (+) Highlights for me food wise was: the bacon from the salad bar (damn, damn, damn!), the caesar salad also from the salad bar, the flank steak, and the sirloin steak. The bacon wrapped chicken certainly gets an honorable mention as well. (+) the addition of the dessert was a nice touch. You have a choice between a NY cheesecake, a chocolate cake, and a tres leches cake. Portion was generous and my chocolate cake was scrumptious!  (-) Meat was noticeably much saltier than what we experienced at the Flamingo location...and this is what stood out to us at the time when comparing it to Texas De Brazil. A bit of a letdown. (-) I'm sorry but I was NOT feeling the lamb.  (-) It was very noticeable that some of these people (employees) do NOT like each other and it  kind of took away from our experience. Nasty and crude comments directed towards each other come off as unprofessional and tacky.   The promotion is a great deal and well worth purchasing, but I would go back to the Flamingo location the next time I feel the need to do a Brazilian steakhouse. All that said, it was still a good meal and still worthy of 4 stars.  4 stars.  Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Meat lovers dream!! They also have amazing potatoes and a salad bar and their bananas and bread are delicious, but be careful not to fill up on throes and save room to try all the meat! Everything tastes amazing!! Great place for Father's Day!  You flip your card to \"green\", and servers come to you with different kabobs and meat and chicken. When full, or you need a breather, flip your card to red and they won't bother you.   Great service! Make sure to come with an empty stomach, very generous portions!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. I received a gift card, and had no idea what to expect. Reservations recommended, fine dinning or business casual. Amazing selection of meat served table side, buffet style salad bar. Looking to impress this Brazilian Steak House is the place."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and it was pretty damn good.  I enjoyed the beef the most.  The filet mignon and some other steak cut were my favorites.  The chickens were really good too.  I didn't care for the lamb, it was my first time having it, but I don't think I'll be trying it again.  Although they give you small portions of meat at a time, I surprisingly got full pretty quick.  A little pricey, but worth it.  Plus the service was top notch.  My plate was rarely without food."}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas I knew I wanted to check out a Brazilian steakhouse since there aren't any in my city. Fogo de Chao was pretty close to our hotel, so a group of friends, my boyfriend and I all went to check it out on a Monday evening around 8 pm. We walked in and were seated right away. Someone came around showing a shrimp cocktail appetizer which we promptly ordered. Then you have access to the salad bar and unlimited meat cuts, served tableside and carved off giant skewers. They give you a little card with green on one side and red on the other, and the idea is to flip it to red once you're in the middle of eating or need a break. Flip it to green, and people will start stopping by again. The card didn't really work, as people kept coming over even when my card was red, or they'd go missing when all I really wanted was some sirloin. No real complaints about that, though because I never had to wait long for anything.  I just need to talk about the \"salad bar\" which is basically a mini Bellagio-style buffet in and of itself. There were lots of different salad options (not just boring garden and Caesar salads), charcuterie, assorted cheeses, an entire tray of sweet and spicy bacon, soups, smoked salmon, antipasti, fruit, vegetables, etc. It was amazing. I could have spent my entire visit just grazing off the salad bar!  The meat options included several cuts of sirloin, filet, ribs, pork sausage, bacon wrapped chicken breast, lamb, and chicken legs. The prime sirloin was my favorite (even if it was a bit overseasoned). The ribs and sausage were both dry, but the lamb and chicken were both awesome! For the most part everything was juicy and seasoned well. They also pass some sides at the table (polenta, cheese bread, roasted plantains and mashed potatoes). A manager kept stopping by to check on us and would ask if there was anything specific we were looking for. Very attentive without being obnoxious. Overall I was really happy with our visit but I don't know that I would go again now that I've experienced it. It's pretty pricey for regular visits (I believe it was about $70 per person)."}
{"text":"Jonathan recommended we eat at this joint, back in late January 2013. Little did I know he was making reservations for a Brazilian Restaurant. I say that because I have never been to one and my first visit would be at one of the finer places to eat at on the restaurant chain. Jonathan, Mike & I casually strolled up to their salad bar-1st thing to do after being seated. We didn't get too much since we knew the main attraction would be coming at us, at our table, in waves-juicy morsels of meat....!!! I always asked for the medium/rare cuts and was well accommodated. The setting was good, table service was impeccable, and having somebody come by to explain what was going to happen and did happen made the experience that much more enjoyable. I will be back to this particular restaurant since it has been established as my pinnacle of Brazilian fine food dining. Thanks Jonathan!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Fogo De Chao for making my husband's surprise 40th birthday so special.  The private room was amazing, so was the service and food.  Our guests thoroughly enjoyed their dinner and drinks! Thanks so much to Ricci!  It was such a pleasure working with you and your team to make my hubby's birthday dinner memorable."}
{"text":"Looking foward to our guys night out at Fogo. Found the staff to  pompous and rude. Went to go sit down and asked about their corkage fee it was $45 per bottle. When we asked to speak to a manager to see if this is true, due to the large amount that was quoted , we were met with a rude reply. So the six of us just got up and went next door. Their neighbor was more than happy to accommodate us in only charge us $15 for a corkage fee. Don't get me wrong  I don't mind paying a little more for corkage fee at a nice restaurant, but really it's just a glorified buffet. The sad part is we probably would have dropped about $600 that night. Maybe we'll go to Texas de Brazil next time ."}
{"text":"This is nothing like any other Fogo I have ever been to. Limited menu, unfortunate salad bar, service is the farthest thing from Brazilian... this place should be in Tempe or Chandler, not Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you are a meat lover, this is your dream restaurant.  All you can eat meat, but not low quality meat. I mean prime quality cuts that keep on coming until you' ve had enough. Skip a meal because you will need the space. Will recommend to anyone visiting Las Vegas. Not cheap but Definately not over priced either."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had acquired two free dinner meals at fogo de chao. Being as we've never been there thought we'd use them & go check this place out. Beginning of our dinner was going great, servers were attentive & on top of making sure our drinks were full & had clean plates between servings.  It was when we mentioned we had the complimentary dinners that things started to go down hill. Servers didn't know what they covered & didn't even bother reading the back of the card where it said it included a free meal, drinks & dessert. We were charged for the drinks & dessert. We also had the manager point at us several times which made us feel very uncomfortable. Don't know if it was because we were getting a free meal or because they didn't know what the coupon covered. Either way that was plain rude and if they wanted to speak ill of their customers they could've done so in the back not right in front of them.   All in all food was good & so were the servers but management was not professional. Won't be returning to this location again unless something is done about the management."}
{"text":"Food and service were very good.  The only slight knock was the noise level in the dinning area,"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give Fogo de Chao (Las Vegas) a try for dinner as we celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary.  The service was top notch, the salad bar, various selections of meats and dessert left the both of us feeling stuffed. My wife continues to brag about the experience. We are looking forward to going back again. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is not easy to review. They do everything right. The restaurant, the service, the food. Everything is great. The only downside is my own gluttonous ways. I have eaten hear a few times over the years. Last night was another great experience.   The meal starts with an explanation of how everything works and what meats you will be overdosing on. You order drink and head up to the salad bar.   It's a great spread. Lots of good salad, meats, and veggies. My wife usually just does the salad bar which she says is more than enough food.  Once you finish your salad, and any worthwhile conversation for the night, the fun begins. You flip your table card from red to green and prepare for meat.  At first it seems to come fast and furious. Many servers offering many cuts of meat. I do have a few favorites.  The house special. Prime sirloin cooked perfectly. Well seasoned and a nice smoky flavor.  I also loved the bottom sirloin (flank steak), the ribeye, and of course the filet. The beef ribs were also tasty (what we call brisket)  The side are also delicious. The little bread like popover things are little bites of heaven. The fried polenta sticks are delicious and the fried plantains offer some good sweetness.  So the meat keeps coming until you flip the card back to red. I usually wait way too long to do that. I ate wayyyyyy too much last night. I think I have gout this morning. My brother may have died.   Some great quotes from our table:  \"That last swallow didn't feel right\" \"They are going to have to crank up the AC in here if I eat any more.\" \"I've got a bad case of the meat sweats going here\"  Love this place. Also nice that I don't need to eat for the next few days."}
{"text":"Typical Brazilian Steakhouse.    You can go here or Texas de Brazil, it's all the same.  Some people say that Fago tastes better because of the smokiness and/or the taste of the grill.  To me, it is all good.  Just don't spend too much time at the salad bar."}
{"text":"My husband made reservations for 6 at Fogo.  When we arrived we were seated right away and our drink orders taken.  Then the feasting began.  Holy moly!!  I can't put as much food away as I used to, but I was pleased to see the other 5 members of my family consumed plenty!  I was pleased with the cleanliness of the place, including the bathroom, because that's a big tell for me of a restaurant that cares.  Our servers were right on with the steak, chicken (more please!), lamb (didn't care for it...it's a personal taste), sausages, etc.  The salad bar was perfect!  Only thing missing was maybe a little bit of fruit to offset the savory of the meats.  Yes, there were the uber tasty bananas, but I was wanting unaltered fruit.  Not complaining...just my personal want.  After dinner, the main waiter arrived with a dessert menu for me to choose something for my birthday dessert.  Ummm...who has room for dessert?  lol  But I chose and he brought 6 spoons so the dessert could be passed around.  Oh!  My sister and I ordered the Moscato to go with the dessert and it was heaven!  Pure heaven!  Thanks you Fogo de Chão for a great birthday dining experience!  We'll be back again...after we  digest all these meat!  ;)  Seriously, lovely place and we look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I am in no way a big fan of meat. I pick it out of my meals constantly, and usually turn my nose up to it. We received dinner for 2 tickets to Fogo at my job's Christmas party, and decided to go last night. From the moment we parked the car, everything was great. The valet went out of his way to open the door for us, the ladies at the front were alert and greeted us promptly. Our wait staff were BEYOND polite, going out of their ways to pull out chairs for us, and constantly there to refill our plates. My husband and I don't drink alcohol, and didn't want soda with this meal. One of the gentlemen helping us offered a really yummy limeade that was soooo good! It was kind of creamy and frothy, and was amazing!! They said it was like a Brazilian limeade, which they made sure we had refills often. Everything was great. No complaints at all!"}
{"text":"Service is fantastic, amazing experience, great food."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Many amazing cuts of meat....the bacon wrapped filet was my overall favorite. Would do it again.... had a great time."}
{"text":"I have been eye balling this place for a couple of years in other cities but never made it. We happen to stay right across the street from here in Vegas. They are brand new here... Day 3. My sister and I were fatigued from mediocre and over priced meals at trendy LV restaurants all weekend. This place is amazing... In every aspect!! The service was attentive and plentiful, but not over the top or insincere.   The food: Amazing.. Enough said! The salad bar was very high quality... Nutty parmesan, high quality cure meats (procuitto etc), butter lettuce, lox, variety of quality  cheeses, homemade salads... I am not a buffet person at all but this salad bar was top notch!!  The meats and sides:  Again top quality and amazing... I loved all the meats.. Especially the lamb, rib eye, filet and house special... Seriously amazing.  $44.50 per person... Worth every dime!!"}
{"text":"All of the staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and clearly understand quality service. They will not stop offering you large portion of what ever they are serving so long as your chip is green. If you want three lamb chops and they only have two on them they will give you the two they have and bring you a third very quickly. If they are offering bottom round but you want leg of lamb, just say no thank you but please bring leg of lamb and next thing you know they will be at your table with it. They brought our table bottom round but we wanted sausage and leg of lamb, next thing I know three servers are at our table with sausage, leg of lamb, and lamb chops. The food is amazing and the verity is nice. Most places that offer an all you can eat buffet style have a few good things and the rest is sub par, that is simply not the case here. Every thing they had to offer was high quality and delicious. The price makes it a place where most people would treat it as a special occasion, but you will get your money's worth and leave happy. Happy and VERY FULL."}
{"text":"Excellent.service they aim to please. The lamb is pure heaven. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"The food is good but all 12 of us could do without the staff cutting meat and dripping grease and food on our clothes. We all had stains on our laps! They need to back up or have another system to serving the meat."}
{"text":"Great place. Super service  by Ciao and  Fernanda, they both were helpful in suggesting different items to try. Garlic sirloin  was amazing as well as the filet. Salad bar alone would have been enough but the meats were amazing. Plantains as a side were also great. Only reason I didn't  give them a 5 star is they have no sodas except in six ounce  bottles. This will be a favorite of mine in the future."}
{"text":"This is the mecca of meat lovers, my husband's \"happy place\", and the only place he will NEVER turn down even when he's beefed out!  With about 12 different meat options and a salad bar you better come hungry and take your time enjoying all the options before you fall quickly into a food trance. Sure its a bit pricey at $50 per person, but considering the quality of the meat is top notch and the huge all you can eat selection it's well worth it every once in a while! They have everything from filet mignon, to top and bottom sirloin, and my favorite, the lamb chops. Finger licking good! The salad bar is rather small compared to others I'm accustomed to, but the chicken and apple salad is memorable, as is the asparagus (which are BIG). Your meal is accompanied by mashed potatoes, plantains and polenta. These aren't anything to brag about, but who comes here to load up on carbs when you have all the meat to chose from. They also have a big wine room with a great selection.  I love that this is a Brazilian churrascaria that aims to look and serve authentic. The servers actually dress in authentic gaucho attire and most actually speak Portuguese! Last churrascaria I went to had caucasian servers who didn't speak a word of Portuguese or Spanish. Big points to Fogo de Chao! Like Sarah M. mentioned, the servers are always accessible but not overbearing. They give you a small discs at the start of the meal - green lets servers know to bring on the meat and red lets them know to move onto the next table. So you can always enjoy your meal at your own pace without feeling overwhelmed.  I love it!"}
{"text":"Not going to sugar coat it:  I was pretty disappointed with Fogo De Chao! I had heard so many great things about it and since I love Texas De Brazil, I was excited to give this a try.  I went to Fogo on my birthday last Thursday night.  Our server was decent but extremely hard to understand.  The buffet style food was just OK.  The selection wasn't as comprehensive as TX De Brazil, nor was it as tasty.  The meat was a bit of a let down too.  The only thing that stood out was the bacon wrapped filet and everything else was just mediocre.  The meal was also very expensive.  For four of us and only 2 of us got a drink, it was around $250 dollars.    The ambience was a bit disappointing too.  In my opinion, it is a step down from Texas De Brazil."}
{"text":"Rock on Vegas! Of course this was the full on Brazilian steakhouse experience. We went for lunch to attempt to keep the cost down... well worth the Uber off the strip. If you want to gorge yourself on steak, bananas, mashed potatoes, yucca and that awesome cheesebread... do so after the bountiful salad bar - cheese, soup, fresh greens, olives, fruit salad, spicy sausages - just for starters. We walked out just over a hundo."}
{"text":"I'm not a big meat eater, but my god, if this was my last meal on earth, I'd die a happy (and uber stuffed) woman. My friend was visiting and she's from Argentina so this was kind of similar to the way the meats are prepared over there. We decided it would be wise to basically starve ourselves (with the exception of water) before our dinner at 7. We also decided to skip out on the salad bar and went straight to the meats to ensure that we could get maximal stuffage in our bellies. They also give you an unlimited ammount of yummy sides (mashed potatoes, sauteed bananas, polenta cakes and this awesome cheesy bread that was so moist and fluffy). Since there are over 15 choices of meats, I'll only name the ones I really liked and ones you might want to skip.   Good meats: top sirloin, filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, flank steak, sausage, and lamb chops (I am not a lamb fan, but boy was this good)  Skips: chicken wrapped in bacon, lamb shank, and pork tenderloin (only because ours happened to be dry)  The guy that seated us gave us helpful tips and pointed out this place is similar to other Brazilian buffets but with better looking servers. Agreed =)  One of our servers told us the reigning champion is a 115lb woman who ate 12 lbs of meat on her birthday (with 2 plates of salad, and a plate of desserts). Gross. Steve Nash apparently can only eat 5-6lbs."}
{"text":"One of the best brazilian steakhouse I've ever been to! Buffet style appetizer was good specially the candied bacon strips! They have a good selection of meats and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"This place...If you like being treated like royalty this is the place to be. Every place you look there are carnivorous delights that can only be obtained here. Everything is tender and juicy and well worth the 50 dollars it cost.(33 on sundays before 2). Some body please give lou a promotion! That man is the heart and soul of this place, and constantly makes sure you dont have to lift a finger. Cant wait to be there TODAY!"}
{"text":"I'm a real critic when it comes to quality in both food and service. By far hands down this restaurants wins! Fantastic service and mouth watering food. The dining area has a very intimate atmosphere. Location is off the strip but well worth the walk from our hotel."}
{"text":"The meats and salad bar are simply amazing. I seriously gain 5 lbs each time I come. So good."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. Super fancy and cute for a date or anniversary or anything like that. They bring you every kind of meat you can try. The desserts are good as well. So is the coffee. Very nice people and great atmosphere! :)"}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception here a couple days ago. throughout the whole planning process, Ricci was extremely accommodating to our changes and concerns. I spent 4 years working in Catering for a high end hotel, and her service is right up there with the best of them. All management staff was outstanding and eager to help. During our event, service was seamless and smooth. Dessert service took a little long, but i think there was some miscommunication between cake cutting and tableside dessert service. Food was amazing and my guests are still texting me telling me how awesome and delicious everything was. Thank you for making our day an unforgettable one!!!!!"}
{"text":"MEAT HEAVEN!  I love this place, great service! I felt that the cuts weren't as varied as other Fogo de Chao locations. However we got a complementary dessert, something that we didn't get when we visited their Chicago location. A little bit on the pricey side, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Meat, meat and more meat!  Meat lovers, this is the place to go to!  Fogo was on my list of \"must-go\" places while in Vegas.  Why? Five words: all. you. can. eat. meat.  Ribeye, sausage, chicken, pork, ribs. Everything but the bathroom sink...served by handsome staff. Food for your eyes as well!  Located a few minutes away from the MGM, Fogo is its own, stand alone restaurant. As soon as we entered, we were immediately seated. If you have Open Table, reserve your seat and earn points.  We were served yummy house cheese-like bread balls. So good! I could eat them all day. They're crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Don't get too stuffed though!  In the center of the restaurant there's an island with plates, salad, starches, and soup. You can go up and grab as you like.  As you dine, the staff walk the floor with spits filled with meat. My favorite was the ribeye. It was so flavorful and moist! As we were dining, they also brought us grilled plantains and mashed potatoes.  Overall, the food and service was amazing. I'd highly recommend going to Fogo!"}
{"text":"AWESOME SERVICE!  If it weren't for the awesome service, I woulda given this place 4 stars. But man o man, the servers were always accessible without being overbearing.  Loved it.  I also loved the salad bar, and the side dishes.  The meat was awesome too, but I'm just not into meat like that.  Next time I return, I'm salad barring it all the way."}
{"text":"If you've eaten at one Brazilian meat House you've eaten at all of them. Large salad bar to fill you up, flame roasted meat, not real steak if you ask me but whatever."}
{"text":"excellent excellent excellent MEAT!   They serve lunch during the weekdays for 26.50 for the SAME EXACT THING AS DINNER that is 46.50. Seriously guys, you can't beat that price.   LOVE this place.   P.S. Their Cheese Bread is by far the best I've ever tasted, and I've been to 6 different Brazillian BBQ places in my life."}
{"text":"My family (my wife is Brazilian) and I visited restaurant Saturday evening and were so disappointed with the quality of the food (salad bar) and the churrascaria. The feijoada was terrible! The chef must have just opened a couple of cans of black beans, added a few pieces of old, over cooked pork, heated it up, and called it a day. The beans were then to be served over a bed of bland, over cooked rice.   Our waiter never offered a menu to order from as an alternative to the salad bar. White tablecloths and extremely high menu prices does not make this a classy restaurant. Our bill for four was $260.! Will not recommend restaurant to anyone nor will we return. Gave restaurant two stars by accident."}
{"text":"Number one  in Vegas, excellent excellent excellent all I can say is very very good food and the service is awesome. One of the servers name is Diogo, and we never wanted for  nothing."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, was introduced to the Cuisine experience and amenities by Danielle Heywood (thank you to that talented lady). The fresh, healthy, gluten-free choices, delicious flavors and seasonings coupled with the incredibly friendly service from Juan... all the staff, made for an exceptional experience!  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"After many years wanting to try a Brazilian steakhouse my wife and finally jumped in with both feet and afterward wished we hadn't.  The meat is all overly seasoned to the point that you really can't taste the meat.  Salt is pretty much the only flavor I tasted from the sirloin.  In addition, most cuts were over cooked.  I wanted to try the lamb and asked for the most rare piece available - it was pretty much well done.    One thing I will say is that the staff is very good.   Too bad they didn't have quality cooked food to serve.    For the price of our dinner for two, we could have had an amazing meal at over a dozen restaurants in Scottsdale for half the price."}
{"text":"Wonderful place that can be just a little better . I would still recommend this to everyone. They just need a better serve off the wine , after we got a bottle we couldn't get the same one by glass and the other one that we got was to warm . Don't serve the table that has all the red tags people need a brake that's why you got the red and green card.  Your experience may be perfect so don't hesitate to visit this place. Food is great , lamb chops where better than last time and the filet was a must try."}
{"text":"We had a marvelous dinner. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and friendly. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"This place has to be by far one of my favorites! The different types of meat are all great. You get great service and a good variety of meats. 16 different cuts!! Not to mention you also get to try the salad bar which has the best fresh salad that's all you can eat. Let's just say you'll definitely be full afterwards. If you're a meat lover like me  this place will be your heaven! :)"}
{"text":"I've Been to Fogo many times in different states at least 3 times at this location, It's sad to say it's not the same.. The meat was less then satisfactory, the flavor was just not there and the meat was tough! Service was slow and inconsistent, waiters were serving some people on our table and forgetting others, I'm not sure what was going on but they need to get they're game back on in order if they want people to come back!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at the Brazilian Steak House Sunday night. I had heard so much about it and was looking forward to a great steak.  First I was shocked when saw a salad bar.  I realize that they don't call a salad bar.  When one needs to go up and serve themselves, it's a salad bar.  When they charge so much for dinner it would have been wonderful if they also brought a salad to our table.  Then they brought out ALL of the meats. Way too much.   By the time you're served the meats almost every piece was at best room temperature. It was also difficult to get your meat rare.   Not enough positive things.  Definitely not enough to bring me back"}
{"text":"When I came here with my wife the first time, we've had the whole \"Churrascaria rodizio\" at Yolie's.  Although Yolie's serves really great meat and the whole experience was just okay (even if they refused my 2nd groupon), I guess it was the lack of warmth from their servers. We wanted to try this place out and we're glad we did because we absolutely loved the experience.  The meat choices was abundant and they were flavored very well.  Customer service was impeccable.  We come back at least once or twice a year since then.  It is a bit pricey, but it's well worth the money.  The Pao de queijo (cheese bread) is one of the best we've had.  It's so addicting!!! Since going to Fogo the first time, we tried other Brazilian steakhouses (i.e., Pampas and Texas de Brazil). Fogo de Chao set the bar and no one has topped it."}
{"text":"This place used to be great, my last visit was horrible with a very poor choice of meats being brought around.  They kept bringing flank steak the cheapest and chewiest meat possible.  For it costing over $200 for three of us at lunch I would recommend the steak house next door.   Only thing great was the salad bar."}
{"text":"Meat lovers paradise, ignore the starches they serve you.  All the meats are good, the one exception is the garlic steak. I like garlic and all, but man that was WAY TOO MUCH garlic.  This is the place that got me to love lamb chops.   If you don't want meat (weirdo) they have an incredible salad bar.  The one thing I wanted to try were those incredible racks of ribs they have in the front window. I need to find out how to get those."}
{"text":"If you like meat,than this is your paradise! We enjoyed the service and meats were full of flavor. The desert is just final super touch to it all!"}
{"text":"Good place for every meet lovers taste. We called ahead and reserve Seats, the table was waiting for us. Service was good, the price is little high I think, but perhaps compensated by fins tasting meat and salads."}
{"text":"If you think you've had a good Brazilian restaurant you have to go to Fogo de Chao!! My husband brought me here for my birthday and I LOVED it. I will be back on a regular basis. The service was impeccable. The atmosphere so comforting and relaxing. This place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Took the baby daddy here for Father's Day. I highly recommend booking your table online through their website. It made it so much easier! We walked right in and they immediately sat us.   The food was amazing. They have a salad type bar where you can get everything from fresh and sautéed veggies to candied bacon. The best part was all the delicious meat you can eat which is cooked to your liking. Even my 4 year old said she loved the food.   I took off one star for 2 reasons... 1) They have a system which incorporates \"drink coaster\" like cardboard circles in which one side is green (to tell them keep the meat coming) and one side is red (to tell them you don't need food at the moment). Even while our coasters were flipped to green, they would still pass our table. There seemed to be a single corner of the restaurant in which they were focusing on, leaving others to sit and wait until they eventually decided they wanted to come our way. 2) Their alcoholic drinks are WAY overpriced for what they are. I ordered a drink that was MAYBE 4 ounces (most of which seemed to be ice) and they charged me $14 for it. The drink was just ok. Definitely not worth the $14 for sure.   Other than that, I'd return again for any other special occasion."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Texas de Brazil is 100x better, having eaten at a few buffet style steak houses this is definitely one of the worst (flavor wise). By all means if you want good service and cheerful staff this is your place, but be prepared to actually eat at the salad bar. Let's just say we ate salads afterwards because we were still hungry. We couldn't eat anymore unflavored highly  fatty meat any longer.   We couldn't even eat the \"garlic\" mashed potatoes mostly because they tasted like instant potatoes. Texas De Brazil is brazillion times better!! Ps the manager was super creepy!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to go! The food was fantastic and well worth the price. I'm fairly certain I ate 50 dollars in filet alone. Considering the fact that I have spent more money on a single steak without sides at a traditional steakhouse, you definitely get bang for your buck with Fogo!   My only complaints are based on the service. There were numerous occasions where my date and I were ready for more meat (with our cards flipped up on the \"ready\" side) and the servers would come to the table next to us, with their backs turned to us and walk away when done.  They never bothered to check if our table or any others behind us were also wanting any. In addition, our main server definitely could have used some wine training as he was not able to tell us anything about the wines we asked about.  Despite some poor service situations, all in all, I was very impressed and will be back soon."}
{"text":"One of the best Brazilian churrascaria experiences I've had. The meat is cooked perfectly and the waiters ask your preference. Even the sides were good, hot foods made fresh to order. Came for restaurant week but ended up getting the full menu instead for the complete meat selection. I've been to the Beverly Hills location but I liked this location better. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Will be back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary. Every time we eat here. The salad bar is lovely. So many choice. The meats are beyond compare. The flank steak is our favorite. By special request they will serve beef ribs which are like the edge of prime rib. Fatty and so flavorful. The manager Ricardo goes out of his way to talk to every table. The service is spot on. All in all this is one of the finest restaurants inn Las Vegas and our go to spot for steak. Third visit in the past 4 months.  Just a terrific place for fabulous dinner."}
{"text":"so this is what its like to be treated like a king. from the moment we took our seats til the last bite of the \"chocolate molten cake\" (which im going to say is a definite must), we were in awe of not only the setting, atmosphere, and delicious meats/treats.   before our wonderful dining experience (or might i say carnivore adventure), i had no idea what to expect... but, between the delectible sun-dried tomatoes (or you could pronounce it,, sun dried tom-ah-toes) and the filet mignon there was an outstanding staff ready to serve.   what i recommend:::::: besides all of it..... -sundried tomatoes -potato salad -cucumbers -filet -top sirloin -pic-kanye??? -and a must.. pitcher of sangria amazing way to end an amazing night... happy 3 year babe ;)"}
{"text":"An orgy of red meat and excess followed by two weeks of cleansing and fasting.  Try to not think of the starving children in Africa as you go through this debaucherous exercise.  I feel like I need to go to 'confession' every time I eat here.  Savor the Picanha.   Addendum:  It's an hour later and I feel horrible."}
{"text":"Definitely a must go when in Sin City!!    Was in the city for UFC183 and decided to make 10pm reservations for post-fight hunger.  We got there right when they were closing their doors at 10:30 but they were so gracious enough to let us dine.  Awesome, awesome, awesome cuts of meats..  My favorite was the sirloin and the beef rib.  I love their chimichurri and hot sauce--must try it!!   Awesome, friendly waiters/waitresses, and hostess. Was close to $55 per person but definitely worth all the all-you-can-eat Brazilian meat that is tenderized and flavorful.   Definitely can't wait to dine again on a future Vegas trip! Thank you Fogo!!"}
{"text":"Re-born again Fogo virgin reporting at duty:  You know the scene in Rush Hour where Jacky Chan and Chris Tucker walk into the \"salon\" with the AYCE sea of women....well thats how I felt like at Fogo de Chao except I don't have to feel guilty and I can live to tell you about my full out meat-gasm experience.  First, the salad bar is massive to say the least with smoked salmon, variety of prosciutto, cheeses, salads, and green and white asparagus. But follow the advice: 1 plate only! You'll be excited but this is a marathon, not a sprint and you'll wanna save your room for the main event. Don't punch yourself out like they say in boxing.  When it comes to meats, go with the lamb chops, filet mignon, rib eye, and bacon wrapped filet. It's easy to wanna grab everything you see but a wise man once told me at a strip club- the key is to scan the room, take everything in, and strategically choose your meats; otherwise you'll be throwing in the towel before you know it.  The meats are well seasoned, delicious, serve how you like it. If you like it bloody, then they got it rare for you.  The service here is exceptional and this growing brand of Brazil steak dominance is here to stay.    I was a kid in candy store. My first experience was with Fogo nearly 15 years ago and I'm proud to say I'm a born again Fogo virgin!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing! I would recommend everyone to try this style of restaurant at least one. The salad bar table was yummy full of different and unique flavors like a pear and goat cheese salad,salami, chicken salad and salmon. Many choices to choose from. I enjoyed the passion fruit caiprhina. Really fantastic drink that had muddled limes and passion fruit. We came for lunch and received a complimentary card for another visit. What a steal, I didn't even know that was going on. The meat ofcourse was a 10z I was not a fan of the filet it was very fatty but seriously the sides the cheese bread it was all amazing!!! I will definitely be coming back to enjoy this place"}
{"text":"This place rocks. I live it and the food is very delicious! Plus they gave us free dessert since it was our anniversary."}
{"text":"Even if your not a meat-eating machine this place has an A-M-A-Z-I-N-G salad bar with top notch ingredients and cheeses and everything your little heart could desire. The important thing to remember when you go is to make sure you go hungry because it can be a little pricey so you want to get your moneys worth of food.  I had been wanting to go here and my work held a business dinner there which allowed me to make it happen. We had a private room in the back which was really nice - made it feel like we were in our own restaurant almost. The staff was so attentive and I love the green means go and red means stop cards you get to show if you want more meat or not. I would forget to turn mine over to red and before I knew it I had every type of meat on my plate.   They were delicious, but I feel like you always end up overeating at this place."}
{"text":"So good!!! Service & food!! My husband & I came here tonight to celebrate our anniversary & it was unforgettable.  The ribeye seemed to melt in your mouth, no chewing required. The brazillian lemonade was by far the best lemonade I've ever tasted. The mashed potatoes were so creamy & delicious, & the rolls so crispy on the outside & moist on the in.  I'll definitely have a meat hangover for days to come, but it was worth it. I just have a little feedback regsrding the service. My husband is not a huge bloody meat eater (I know, crazy right?) So when certain cuts were brought to our table he'd ask for a portion that wasnt pink & the server would say he'd be right back with something well done, but than never returned. This happened 3 times & he missed out on some awesome cuts because of it. But we will still be back; after I train his taste buds to enjoy a bloody steak just as much as I do."}
{"text":"So this is not the first place you would imagine a vegetarian enjoying but it was surprisingly better than expected. There's a large all-you-can-eat dinner bar that includes tons of salads, grilled vegetables, potatoes, rice and beans which is the essence of what the vegetarian menu is. The cost is $30 which is higher than I would pay but when out with others who enjoy the restaurant, your choices are limited. They also bring fried Yuka and grilled plantain to the table, both of which are good. The wine menu is reasonably priced. All in all, a 3/5 for the taste of the vegetarian only options. You will be full and satisfied if you go here with your meat-loving friends, but nothing is crave-worthy. The service is phenomenal 5/5. The waitstaff is very attentive and constantly looking to bring you anything you need. Be aware, the meat is brought quickly in rounds by the servers as shown in my picture. So while you have vegetarian options, you need to be comfortable with a large amount of grilled meat all around you. Overall not a bad place when you are appeasing someone else's meat cravings."}
{"text":"Yum!   The only downside is the way they swarm you when you first get there.   By design maybe to get you full fast. But was probably the quickest meal my friends and I have ever had in Vegas.    I took my time but they were done in 10 minutes. Hahahah.   Fav at this location was  Pork rib The brisket cut  The lamb butterfly  Stay Away from ribeye no flavor compared to other steak houses.    And I was bummed out by beef rib. Was dry compared to Texas de Brazil"}
{"text":"I usually go to Texas de Brazil, but I wanted to try something new for a change. I heard great things about Fogo de Chao, so I was very excited to try it. I am only giving three stars because the market table was not even half as good as what I am used to at Texas de Brazil. The rice at Fogo literally taste like Uncle Ben's instant. No potatoes Au gratin, no lobster bisque, no marinated mushrooms. What the hell? Also, the ambiance was so boring I felt like I was sitting in Olive Garden. On a positive note, the staff was friendly and the meat was cooked nicely. I just felt like it lacked the fun, upbeat churrascaria experience with a disappointing salad bar."}
{"text":"All you can eat varieties of meat with an awesome salad bar? What is this magical place you say? Fogo de chao! Very nice place with staff that bring you tons of varieties of meat. As a man this place is heaven, you can eat enough meat to be diagnosed with gout. All joking aside, I love this place. Try it."}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at another restaurant, this place made my day! Staff was so nice and food was delicious! Stay away from the restaurants on the strip and come here! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was there for a private luncheon seminar for the disabled. The male servers as a whole are very nice except for one female working the private affair. She skipped bringing any of the appetizers, salad, bread and drinks to my table. After the I asked for iced tea around the 4th time I literally got up from my table to get it myself. At this time, she said some very nasty things in Portuguese about me and just because I'm fair haired and skinned doesn't mean I'm not fluent in other languages. She was offensive, nasty and rude. I did tell her in Portuguese that I understood everything she said and she was in utter shock. NEVER AGAIN would I consider eating there. Management, tell your employees NOT to talk about your guests. You never know if a guest speaks that language or is a critic."}
{"text":"Here you don't have the choice of menu items, you have no choice but to get the all you can eat. I like my meat medium well and every time they cut me a piece it would be rare. The head waiter had asked me if there was anything he can get me because he saw that my plate had so much red meat pushed off to this side. I said yes, I would like more cooked meat, and he must have yelled at somebody because we just had servers after servers come up to us with well done meat."}
{"text":"I wish I could eat here every night! This place is UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Get ready to eat, because it truly is an experience. I had a Caramel Pineapple Old Fashioned to start my booze off. I also had everything at their salad bad, bc duh it's delicious. LOL.  I wish I could remember all the names of the meat, but I can't. I tried them all. Many things were wrapped in bacon too. So obviously I had multiple servings.   This specific location is the most authentic, as majority of the employees and servers are Brazilian."}
{"text":"The actual experience was better than expected.  And I expected a lot what with all the stories of endless meat.  The little rolls made of Yucca flour and cheese (I don't know what they are called) were incredibly tasty.  They are light yet somehow very satisfying.  There were too many cuts of meat to count, all of which were prepared very well in different temperatures so you can have your preference.  One of my favorites was the garlic beef.  Service and atmosphere were both excellent.  All the servers and \"meat-men\" were extremely friendly and well-polished."}
{"text":"Birthday - Wedding Anniversay My husband is on strict all meat diet so I took my husband on a date for our birthday and anniversary and decided to try this place Fogo de Chao. It's his first time to dine in a Brazilian Steakhouse and I am glad that he likes it. The place is very cozy. Staff are very approachable, friendly, efficient and attentive. Our server named Luis did a great job. We are very happy with the service and his recommendation with the wine. The surprise and complimentary desserts for our birthday and anniversary are amazing and very tasy. The meats are just melting in my mouth. The salad bar are so fresh and I asked for watermelon in the of my meal, they gave me and OMG it was so fresh and sweet. The forebidden black rice is something different and I like it. We will definitely come back and eat more meats. Thank you for the great experience and service. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Our Sons and their families came in from Portland to surprise my husband for his 70th birthday and reserved the private party room and our experience was great! We have 3 young grandchildren and the staff was very attentive to all of our needs including chocolate, dairy and gluten sensitivities! The Market table was outstanding and all of the meats served were done to perfection! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The food, service was out of this world. Minh was an awesome host and made our experience that much better. Thank you again"}
{"text":"Great time and amazing service at Fogo De Chão . First time to experience the amazing food and ambiance there. Special thanks to Cameron for assisting us on our first visit there and helping us achieve the perfect anniversary date . Highly would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a great time tonight for my birthday. Minh was our server and he suggested a delicious shrimp dish! Amazing! Really great first time there!"}
{"text":"Great meat done the way you like it.  The servers were falling over themselves  to make sure there was plenty of meat on the plate.  The salad bar surpasses your expectations.  Great food great value"}
{"text":"If you love Brazilian barbeque and have an appetite, come here. Located not far off the strip, it was an easy drive to get here. My family and I were excited to try this place. I was more excited for them being it was their first time eating at a Brazilian steakhouse.  We made reservations for dinner so we didn't have to wait when we arrived. We all went straight to the salad bar. I was impressed by all the yummy selections at the salad bar: salmon, fresh cheeses, prosciutto, asparagus, etc. The guys were quick to come to our table with all the different selection of meats. Everything was so good. The meats were tender and moist. I don't even think I tried everything because I was so stuffed. The polenta fries and cheese bread was a little salty but still good.   Service was great here! The only downside: They don't have grilled pineapple!! Super sad face!"}
{"text":"I have experienced eating at only one other Brazilian steak restaurant in Beverly Hills and it was excellent. So I couldn't wait to share the experience with my 2 friends while we were in Vegas. Very disappointing in comparison. We were seated 30 min. After our reservation time. The person that came to our table spoke so quickly we couldn't understand what she said. A waiter came by with shrimp cocktail to offer, we accepted not realizing we just rang up another 27.00 to our tab. The meat that was served was salty and undesirable to say the least. The salad bar was the best thing this place had to offer. For $314.00 a salad bar is hardly worth it."}
{"text":"Sometimes it amazing and some times it just ok.. Depends on the day. The cheese bread is always the best of the best. the deserts are also very very good...they have a nice SALAD bar. I have been here 5 to 10 times and the beef robs are always good the rest are sometime a 9 sometimes a 6. its a bit pricey but on a good day well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I will never go to another steakhouse again.  This place is the best.  Salad bar is great with all the salad you could want plus fine cheeses, cured meats, etc.  The main course meats are the best I've ever had.  The sides are great.  Service is great.  Price is completely reasonable.  With wine, bill was $164 for some incredible food for 2 people."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Mr.  Ricardo customer service always VIP all the way.  I was introduced to him by my good friend Mr. Neri/Regional Manager West Coast Division.  I was there on the grand opening when Mr. Neri recognized me from the Beverly Hills location where I'm pretty much a regular.  Fogo basically like a carnivore's heaven.  This is coming from a weekdays vegetarian girl! lol.  I love it here.  The meat always consistent to what you order.  And I love how just after a few rounds they take noticed of what you like and don't like.  Now that's customer service.       Every time I go to Vegas,  Fogo is ALWAYS been my stopping ground.  They always get it right here, Beverly Hills, Scoots, Texas, Atlanta, doesn't matter where you go first class all the way"}
{"text":"From the time you walk in, to the time your done it's an amazing experience. The salad bar is the way to start your meal, but if your vegetarian or vegan, it's a perfect salad bar for you. As for meat eaters, the meat is delicious. The drinks are to die for. And the deserts are amazing. They also added fish to the menu, so there is something for everyone. Perfect date night."}
{"text":"Very good food ,excellent staff.  Will go back for sure.great price for what you get.."}
{"text":"February 14.2017 - I surprised my husband by treating him to dinner here for his birthday. I'm glad that I made reservations 2-3 weeks in advanced, because once we arrived, there was a line out of the door! We approximately arrived at Fogo de Chao at 7:15 PM and had reservations at 7:30 PM. The wait wasn't bad... we maybe waited 15-18 minutes before we were directed back to our table.   Although Fogo de Chao was BUSY, the service was still amazing! The food was delicious! Samson was our waiter and he took very good care of us. He was attentive and made surprisingly good small talk with my husband and I. Since it was my husband's birthday, Samson gave my husband a complimentary dessert. In addition to that, Samson presented us with a complimentary lunch or dinner card for dinning in on Valentine's Day.   Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and planning our next trip to Vegas to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Oh my this place is ridiculous! So good! And the service is impeccable.. At one point we had five servers dropping stake! The manager Ricky came and even gave us deals to other places! What more could you say... Top notch."}
{"text":"Never ever ever ever EVER come to this place when you're not starving. Seriously your stomach better be growling like a beast, your feet must be tapping on the ground anxiously, and you HAVE to be begging for meat-heaven when you come to this place.  Only then will you be able to make your money's worth.  That being said, this restaurant is very fancy and very expensive. But it's worth it for the meat and for the sheer satisfaction of it all. Each meat is cooked to perfection making sure each bite is flavorful and distinct- different from the other ones. My favorite would have to be the Special and the Chicken.. something.  I never really caught the names of the meat since I was too busy drooling as the waitress brings them to my table. Sorry.  Now, the salad bar must not be left behind either. The apple salad is just amazingly scrumptious and crunchy and the rest of the vegetables is fresh. Definitely stock up on the vegetables because it prevents you from getting sick off of meat-overload.  I had the Brazilian Lemonade to drink and it was the best lemonade EVER. It was sweet, tangry, smooth, and juicy."}
{"text":"Amazing Salad and Grilled Veggie Bar and as well as the most amazing tender meat on skewers- sliced fresh and hot in front of you. The most amazing fried polenta, the most amazing mini popovers, and fried bananas.. Don't walk but run to Fogo de Chao... lunch or dinner is  the best meal and great service!"}
{"text":"Fogo is one of my favorite steakhouses everywhere it is located, this business is extremely well maintained, with quality food, service and infrastructure. If you are looking to eating the food of Gods, this is the right place for you. Don't worry about diversity because at Fogo de Chao they have a wide variety of meats, fish, vegetables, soup and salads. Their salad bar is divine and their meat is well prepared by the chef, which is mostly likely to be a very good one, just like in the other restaurants they have around the world.  Let me remind you that I'm Brazilian and I love eating good food. I used to go to Fogo de Chao back in Brazil all the time,  specially during special occasions like birthdays etc.  If you are a hippie, a vegetarian, or even a vegan, Fogo de Chao will accommodate you too!!! However you might have to be dealing with some bloody red meat floating around :) so it might not be the best place for you if you don't really like looking at yummy tasty red meat.  This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, and together with Via Brazil, they carry on the good reputation of the real quality of an authentic Brazilian Steakhouse.   Just be careful to not engage in a food coma, and remember to order a Caipirinha cocktail! It's a Brazilian signature drink...  Have fun, and remember to order the Garlic Picanha, Flank steak, and  file wrapped in bacon..."}
{"text":"I've had two experiences at Fogo.  One with a very large party and one with a party of four.  Both the service and food were consistent.  For anyone new to Fogo, it's a fixed price (about $45) for salad bar and all you can eat meat (beef, pork, chicken, lamb).  Start with salad bar (save room) and flip your little card to green when you're ready for meat.  A parade of servers will offer their wares, say yeah or neah and wait for the next.  Flip card to red when you don't need service.  Salad bar is fantastic.  I can't resist the smoked salmon, mozzarella balls, and apple salad.  In fact, on my second trip, I loaded up so much from the salad bar, I skipped the meat entirely.  I'm also particularly fond of the polenta and bread (which is more like a popover).  Based on my first experience, some of the meat offerings are better than others.  But since you can have as much or as little of anything as you would like, try everything.  I can also recommend the papaya cream for dessert.  Don't worry you won't have room.  It's light enough that you can make room.  As far as service, it is excellent.  As soon as you flip that card to green, servers are there.  The only complaint on both visits is that they do ask if they can bring you a particular cut of meat, and then they don't follow through anyway.  It's not like you'll go hungry, but it can be a little annoying."}
{"text":"You had me at Giant Bowl of Bacon! Everything here was so great. I thought because it was a chain it would be sub-par, but I was wrong. And the service - wonderful. Will be back. If you are thinking of going, just do it - you won't regret it. Oh and the cocktails are awesome too! Had to Guava and also the Cucumber and mint."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Wonderful ambiance and the food was amazing. Took my hard to please husband there for Father's Day and he was very happy! We all enjoyed it! Pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Meatgasm.  Meat.  Meat.  Meat.  Why thank you, Brazil!    This is a man's paradise.  Beautifully cooked and seasoned meat and all you can eat.  The first dude to flip his card to red is a sissy.  Don't make plans after you eat here. You'll be so full are you likely to pass out in the parking lot.  Brilliant!  My favorites include the filet mignon with bacon and the ribeye.  The mashed potatoes and plantains are also great!  The salad bar is nice too, but skip it and eat all the meat you can possibly fit in your belly.  The first time we came here some doofus refilled my Mai Tai with iced tea.  Before I could let my complaint roll off my tongue, there was a manager there to correct the problem."}
{"text":"I often tell people that I'm a meat-atarian, in which case, you could basically call Fogo de Chao a magical paradise for me! This was my first visit here during AZ Restaurant Week (everything was the same on the menu - no prix fixe - it was just cheaper than it typically is by about $10).  I made it my personal mission to try all of the meats on the menu and I was so close! I just missed one.. the bacon wrapped filet. I'll admit that by the end of the meal, I felt defeated and could not muster enough energy to ask the waiter to send over a guy with the bacon wrapped filet. I am okay though. I am proud to say I tried every other meat including the pork, lamb and chicken, not just the beef steaks!  If you don't want to get meats, you can pay about $20-something for just the salad bar. At first before going there, I thought it would be a rip off to just pay for the salad bar, but once I saw it in person, I said, \"Now I get it!\" The salad bar is loaded! There was sliced deli meats, smoked salmon, chicken salads in addition to cheeses, vegetables, and of course salads themselves. If you are a true meat-atarian as one of my husband's friends is, he warned us to stay far away from the salad bar. He told us, \"That is just a distraction\" that fools you into getting full before the meat cuts are served. It's a pretty simple concept. Turn that coaster green and you're in meat heaven. The waiters start hovering around your table with so many choices of meats, and you just keep saying, \"Yes, I'll try that\" over and over again no matter what your stomach's limit is. When I went there with my in-laws, I specificially told them, \"Do not eat all day,\" because I wanted them to be prepared for the smorgasboard.  I liked the setting too. The huge room was classy yet the atmosphere felt casual. You didn't have to dress overly fancy to eat here. I felt you could still be comfortable and wear stretchy clothes if you wanted to.. You know, to fit all that food in to get your money's worth. I guess my only slight complaint was that even though I asked for alot of meats to be served medium rare - they came out as medium and medium well on alot of meats. The sirloin and lamb cuts I received were perfectly medium rare but my filet each time was on the medium well side. I didn't want to waste the meat I had though in hopes of another one after the waiter had already served me the one I had. Should I have said something? I really don't know.. I'll just be more assertive about looking for a cut that's more medium rare next time, because I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception here and it was amazing! We had a wonderful time, all of our guests were happy even the vegetarian ones. Our host, Sabrina was great! She was amazing and as a plus she speaks Spanish which was very convenient for some of our guests.  We couldn't  pick a better place to celebrate our special day! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great selection of food and salad.  Stellar service Surely a great dining experience"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. My husband and I try to visit Fogo de Chao whenever we're near one. Come ready to eat!!"}
{"text":"OMGosh!  Just go!  Save your money and have a great night.  And whatever you do...be sure to enjoy their version of a mojito.  The food and drinks were delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to set any kind of mood, this may not be the place to do it. The ambiance is definitely here along with all the lights on, this place is so bright it's ridiculous.  I'm still trying to understand why a place of this caliber would think this is ok, or did I just go here on a day someone forgot to dim the lights? I need answers.   Other than that the staff was amazing. The salad bar was not the best. I had a few things off it and the potato salad was completely tasteless along with the Brussel sprouts.  The mashed potatoes, plantains and fried yucca that was placed on our table was great.   Meat selections here are great with the exception of one: the bacon wrapped steak was fatty and awful just as someone said above, I think they could very well remove it from the meat line up and no one would miss it.  To be honest I have to say I enjoyed Texas de Brazil much better and that really sucks for me because this location is right in my neighborhood unlike Texas de Brazil.   Is this place worth the $49.99 per person, yes especially for me I am a lamb lover so that alone wins me over. But I think I may have to take a drive out of the neighborhood next time I'm in the mood for a Brazilian steak house.   Drinks range of $9.50-14.00"}
{"text":"First of i shouldnt be writing a review to a stake house. I am a vegetarian. So I would rate this place OK for all other vegetarians. Had to go there for company Christmas party."}
{"text":"Hubby and I celebrate our birthdays kind of close to each other and Fogo de Chao is one of my favorites birthday places. Sign up for their email list, read the fine print on the birthday offer they send and you will see. We got $25 off for lunch or dinner churrasco experience, plus birthday dessert. Vanessa was our server this time and she was amazing, Brian assisted her too. I did not get names for our gauchos but pretty much everyone was awesome this time around.  Our favorite always are the beef ribs, which I do not think they bring regularly to the tables, we always ask for them (even more than once).  The salad bar was a little different but it had solid options, we also noticed the meats had different offerings but did not pinpoint all the changes. My best advice for this place is to be very conservative with the salad bar, and start with super small portions of all the meats the gauchos bring to your table, and I mean tiny. Then once you try a few (or all of them) you can ask for little bigger portions of your favorites. Enjoy!  PS The only down side for me here is that they do not offer the grilled pineapple like some other churrasco places do. : ("}
{"text":"My bf was so excited to try this place since he's a meat lover. Unfortunately, he was very disappointed. My bf likes to eat his meat bloody or medium rare. All the meats that were served to him were well done. So he only ate a few pieces and gave up on the number one thing he loves to eat.   The service, salad bar and dessert is the reason for the 3 stars. I can definitely say that they have impeccable service. The servers all worked together to give the customers great service. The salad bar was also good. It had a wide variety. I personally loved the pineapple/apple salad. The dessert was awesome. We had the strawberry cream. It was a great way to finish the meal.   Maybe we will be back for the desserts."}
{"text":"Wow what a serious disappointment. The service was really poor; waiter forgot the wine and the check and we sat for almost 30 min without food or drinks. The food was sad too. Of 17 meats, we barely got to try half and what we did try was all mediocre. Then there is the giant price tag for all of this and it ends up being a bitter pill to swallow. Will not be back; will not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!!! The service is always on point. Food is excellent but don't forget your wallet. keep up the good work."}
{"text":"1st time to this location. We came here for my daughter's birthday. Everyone here is so nice. The food is great. Service was great and attentive. Atmosphere was nice. EVERYONE is genuinely soooo nice. We had a good time and will be coming back again soon. Even my kids wanna come back."}
{"text":"Excellent service.   Amazing meat selections.   Can't really go wrong with Fogo De Chao. :)   My favorite meat is their house special, Picanya and lamb chops but honestly they are all amazing. Second favorite would be the garlic beef filet mignon. Every time I go here, I am tempted to order a bunch of their cheese breads to go!"}
{"text":"We came here for our wedding dinner with a party of 15. The service was awesome!! We had a private room in the back. The food was unreal with tons of choices of meat that filled all of our bellies. They went above and beyond cutting our wedding cake even. I would recommend this place for dinner or even hosting a small celebration dinner."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale,  They have an excellent wine selection, the service is outstanding, and your generally be around classy people, because it's a minimum of $50 per person which is well worth it, They have  several different high-quality  cuts to choose from, enjoy yourself, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Meat quality is top notch FOR the price you pay. Remember it's a $50 ayce not a $50 4oz filet  mignon. The salad bar selection is fancy and delish. Service is always good! The cheese rolls are addictive."}
{"text":"I don't eat beef, chicken, pork or lamb so you can imagine my enthusiasm when my dining parter wanted to go to \"all you can eat meat\".  I was happily surprised to find you can order just the salad bar and have a completely satisfying meal.  The salad bar includes a wonderful assortment of grilled vegetables, cheeses, soup, rice and beans in addition to more traditional salad fixings.  I will happily return ( minus the meat)."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an all you can eat Brazilian dining experience, this place is for you!   Start off at the all you can eat gourmet salad bar. You'll  find everything there from heavenly bacon, roasted tomatoes, and asparagus the size of tree trunks.   Fogo de Chao provides an endless selection of meats brought to your table on enormous skewers by waiters dressed in gauchos. The garlic sirloin, lamb chops, and house prime sirloin are delish! You'll also get family style side dishes of sweet bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheesy bread rounds. Be careful, those cheese rounds are addictive!   The cocktail and wine menu provides tasty options and be sure to save some room for the dessert- I HIGHLY recommend the tres leches cake.   The service is stellar - everyone is friendly and helpful. Don't see what you want? Just ask and it'll be brought to your table pronto.   Because this restaurant is a little pricey (but well worth it!), make sure you sign up for their mailers to receive information on special pricing offers."}
{"text":"Best Lunch Ever!!! Every mouthful was never a wasted effort! Ever item a unique, and flavorful experience!! And the service Outstanding!! Light eaters just do the buffet. But if your a  carnivore, make sure you save lots of room, try a bit of everything, you won't be disappointed. And make sure you have time for a long lunch there's too much to try! Thank You Happy Holidays, Christine Holliday"}
{"text":"Best salad bar ever. Everything is fresh and crisp. The smoked salmon is great along with the cheeses and prosciutto are so good! The meat is always great. My favorite are the house special and the filet mignon. The service was on point. We took our 3 young children and they didn't even charge us. That was really nice because they eat like birds! I have been to the Beverly Hills location and its always packed. This location was not packed at all! Maybe because its off the strip and there are so many restaurants in the hotels. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for fine dining and excellent service and short wait to be seated."}
{"text":"This may not be fine dining but it sure is good food.  I was the first one to make fun of  people who went to this place in DC until some friends took me to the one here in Scottsdale. I am also a boo hooer of salad bars but this one was different, it had beautiful parmesan cheese, the real deal, nice charcuterie and roasted asparagas.  The meats were succulent and delicious, i love the lamb chops, the filet mignon and the signature sirloin.  The stand out was the service at this Fogo de Chao, the meat carvers were on top of their game and it turns out they are  all from Brazil and work here in the states for one year.  One of them told us that he was going to Open the Denver Restaurant and then was off to Baltimore for 2 months.  It turns out that the owners rent places for them and the share quarters around the country.  management at all other restaurants are Brazilian except the Scottsdale one.  The wait staff is composed of local college age people who have been indoctrinated into the Brazilian style of european service.  it is a delightful experience! I don't think anyone could eat here as a regular diet but a few times a year won't kill you.  I for one can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best steak experience ever!!!! This is definitely a splurge type place if you are lucky to be in a town that actually has one. Service got a little shaky towards the end of our meal but it was terribly busy, being that it was Saturday night on Valentine's day weekend. Five stars does this place the justice it deserves for both the ambiance and top notch food quality! Would do it all over again if I had the chance!"}
{"text":"I had no clue what to expect when eating at a Brazilian steakhouse. It was delicious!!! The waiters were VERY attentive! Not use to that... Wasn't a bad thing. They never let your drinks go low, anytime you turned your card over for more meat, 5 or so people came right away! Their bread and fried bananas were to die for!!! Worth the $50 for dinner.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Salad bar is amazing, meat is so so. They have a great selection but for the price not sure if it is worth it. Maybe once in a while for a special event..."}
{"text":"Superb!  Excellent food, superior service, lovely decor.  The best possible customer experience you can have."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing.  Not only is the meat amazing but the service is spectacular. Since there is no specific \"servers\" everyone was so perfectly attentive. I took my boyfriend here for his big birthday dinner and they even comped our dessert for us. We never asked for any special birthday deals or anything I just asked that they write happy birthday on his dessert for him. So sweet! The manager even stopped by at the end of our meal to talk to us and ask us how everything was. With everything you can get in Vegas we'll definitely be coming back here.   Did I mention the cheese bread absolutely phenomenal?? It's crazy good."}
{"text":"Some of the best food available in Vegas.  Salad bar and about 20 different types of meat.  When you flip the coaster to green, get ready.  The guys come from the shadows with skewers of meat and load you up. By the time your plate is stacked up, it's  anyone's guess what you actually have on your plate. It doesn't really matter though.  It's all excellent.  Will be back many times before my Las Vegas trip is over."}
{"text":"Havent been to a Brazilian-style steakhouse since in Puerto Vallarte this past summer. While the meat was better in PV the salad bar at Fogo is a low carbin' dream! We're talking fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano (a whole wheel), manchego cheese, prosciutto.. delicious and satisfying all this and more for only 19.50! Now if you want to have endless rounds with the Gaucho's you'll have to pony up $42.50 (including unlimited salad bar), a real bargain if you ask me, great quality. The meat just keeps coming and coming.. highlights were the leg of lamb, garlic beef and the sausage. They also bring a basket of bread (they forgot ours) as well as fried bananas, mashed potatoes and fried polenta.. be sure to skip that stuff and stick to the meats and salad bar.   Oh, avoid the pork ribs.. while the Mr liked his, mine tasted like they were in someones ass for a while.. pretty nast though I think was the bones.   Now if the only the Gaucho's were shirtless or wearing ass less chaps.. well one would hope."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Carnivores feast...the service was great..the food just kept coming!!! Excellent experience...come hungry!!!"}
{"text":"WOW! I was blown away. The moment I sat down, I was greeted by the largely brazilian staff like a member of their own family. I wasn't expecting the orgy of meats that awaited me at Fogo de Chao."}
{"text":"Overrated place overall. Service goes straight 5 stars, yet the food is pretty disappointing. Good & bad about the food: Top and bottom sirloin cut is amazing, definitely 5 stars. Lamb chop and prime beef cut is of good quality as well, 4 stars for that. Lamb leg and prom ribs are bland. 2 stars, they could use more seasoning on those. Chicken leg is absolutely disgusting... seriously, I have never tasted any chicken leg worse than that.   Literally just an evenly cooked/salted drumstick, skip this one if you could. The whole buffet part is skippable as well, there is nothing really editable compared to their top notch steak cut. Uncleaned salad leaves and unpeeled pineapple cuts, wtf.  I am super speechless on everything else besides their super cuts. They have so many great materials  but sadly they don't know how to cook them well."}
{"text":"Always a good spot for date night or client entertaining....  Foga De Chao is a pretty solid bet for your nicer dining needs. Whether you are in Chicago or Scottsdale you always get the same quality of food and service.   Brazilian steakhouses are"}
{"text":"We dined at the Summerlin Fogo De Chao Brazilian Steakhouse with a group of friends and family. It was a birthday celebration for our twin grandchildren. The dining room design and arrangement is open and bright. Plenty of room between tables. The room was conversation friendly.   Service was friendly and prompt. I would have preferred that the pace of the entrees been slower. Although the red and green sided disk indicates that you request service or pass is explained the wait staff continues at a fast pace like drivers ignoring a red stop light. However, there is no food shortage just ask for your preference or wait for the server to come around. The variety of protein is plentiful. There are ten differently prepared entrees of  beef, pork, lamb, chicken and pork sausages    Several sides are served at the table. Cheese bread, polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas.  The salad bar has a wide selection of cold items plus a soup of the day however I recommend passing on the salads in favor of the great meat and poultry. The soup of the day was Butternut Squash which was flavorful but I would have preferred a thicker broth.  All of the roasted entrees were well prepared and the degree of cooking was available for all. Deserts were not attempted as there was no room available."}
{"text":"Different concept in all you can eat dining. That is - servers walk around to offer varieties, versus only a buffet style get up and get your own. But you still had to get up and get your own veggies, salads, soup, snack type cuts etc. Easy to get stuffed. So if you want to try most the served meats, limit your buffet plate fills.  First time to try Brazilian cuisine and if anything, I give 5 stars to the carved meat flavors. I don't care much for the flip coaster - green for 'yes more meat'. It was just another task to remember to do while enjoying a meal. Also, when we had the red flipped for no meat, it didn't work. The servers were happy to offer the roast on their large metal skewers regardless.  I don't eat this much meat ever, so the restaurant isn't one I'd dine often. It is a treat for protein eaters and recommend for those who diet this way. They serve everything for carnivores: chicken, pork, lamb, beef. My favorite flavors were the pork roast and NY cut, though these meats aren't my normal protein choices; I enjoyed them.  If you can't have fine dining without a cocktail, I suggest Brazilian Nights. It's like a martini, punches with the all savored ingredients. The sweet does pair well with the meat somehow; at least I thought so.  Nice place to celebrate any occasion. Location is off strip which makes parking easy. In addition, valet is complimentary! Nice interior, not too dim. They have a visible wine cellar. Service is constant. A table may have several servers. One was even super friendly to have a conversation with us; and we learned from each other - story tellers lounge kinda atmosphere."}
{"text":"I celebrated two Valentine's Days there. It was an extremely busy place those days. Service was very good, servers were friendly, patient and attentive, but it took some time to get our drinks (about 10 minutes or even more). I still put 5 stars because I would recommend this place for any occasion or just lunch/dinner. The food there is delicious."}
{"text":"Really nice ambiance, good wait staff and more meat than one knows what to do with.  The salad bar has a good variety of vegetables and fruits. The variety of meats is mostly beef but it's all tasty. Their is a good sized wine list and the tres leches cake is delicious. Overall a nice experience. It's a little pricey but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great service! First time here, and I receivers a waiter who kindly explained what to order, how to order, etc. The waiters/waitresses gives great customer services and are full of humor. Free (buttery) bread and water! Has 13 varieties of meat! Seafood counts as an additional cost, unfortunately. Overall, amazing (10/10) service, many meat choices, and FREE WATER!    P.S. If you're celebrating an anniversary, they, the waiters/waitresses, will surprise you with a cake."}
{"text":"Such a treat to go here with my brother in law & his family. It was their pick & their treat & they knew just how to hit the spot. The only thing was I wished I prepared my appetite for such a feast. My husband & I both had never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse but boy did we find out real quick what it was all about. I loved all of the sides that you had to choose from. It was almost overwhelming. When they ask you if you want more bread just say, \"YES.\" Those things were to die for. So fluffy, light & cheesy. The coolest part of the experience has to be the numerous Carvers coming up to your table ready to serve you quality cuts of meat cooked to perfection. Everything from lamb, bacon wrapped filet, chicken, ribs, etc. Absolutely no exceptions, no matter what you MUST try the house special Sirloin. Turn your coaster over to the red side when you've had enough but turn it back over to the green side when you're ready for the Carvers to come running back. It's all you can eat so make the most if it. A carnivores dream come true. This restaurant was plan B on our dinner list for the night but it definitely turned into an amazing culinary experience."}
{"text":"We went to try this Brazilian restaurant for my birthday party. It was new for us. The servers serve us variaty of meet such as top tenderloin, lamb, rib eye, new York steak etc. The meat was awesome and tender. Salad bar was ok, nothing spacial."}
{"text":"My original review from 11/14/2012  I wish i could give this place more stars.  Wildly decadent and over the top AMAZING, I almost am at a loss for words.  First and foremost the entire staff is on point with seamless service, they are professional, personable,  and extremely knowledgeable = 5 star service !  Love the interior -classy, clean, simple elegance.  The salad bar completely blew my mind with its gorgeous/ inviting appearance. Not a wilted veggie in sight just fresh looking lush colored choices, asparagus, and artichokes O MY GOSH were as great as they looked. Prosciutto, and cheese was dy-no-mite !  Great looking breads.. feared i would now live vicariously through watching Erich enjoy all that crusty, soft goodness (and the s.o.b makes it look so damn good ..grrrrr !!! ) NO- not this night  as they offer GLUTEN-FREE ...5 stars for the salad bar !  I also love the concept of flipping the card from red to green (red light, green light 123) ha ha  ...I digress.  THE MEAT ...TA-DA !  carved table side is succulent ..savory ..tender ...utter bliss Picanha,  and Alcatra positively melted like butter .The lamb according to my sexy Non GF bread eater was amazing . Caipirinha drinks were Fabu,  and refreshing . We also had so much fun. ..we left sated and feeling sexy .I love when that happens.  Fogo is going to the top of my five star list for it's outstanding service, mouth-watering meat,  GF friendly,  and THE SEXIEST salad bar !  I might never cook again.....  update:   Still amazing I am in love with the salad bar!"}
{"text":"Love Fogo De Chao! Go here every 6 months to stuff my face with the best meats on the planet. Big alcohol selection if you can afford it and the cheese/salad buffet is a nice side compliment to the meat. This is a place to take your wifey or sister visiting in town. 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"ordered: - dinner  pros: - brown sugar and black pepper bacon - pork had great smoky flavor - all the beef was tender, garlic sirloin and ribeye were the best - parmesan coated chicken thing was juicy - dem bread rolls - lemonade and guarana soda were refreshing in between meat drinks - went for restaurant week [we're poor] and service of meats was still quick and everything at the salad bar was refilled quickly and tasted fresh - meal comes with dessert, tres leches wet af, cheesecake was good 2 - the food coma after the meal  cons: - reservations were made for 7, arrived at 6:55, we were given a pager [maybe their definition of a reservation is different than mine], we were not seated until 7:30 - finished a plate of apps/ meat before we got our drinks, server forgot my mother's drink [cmon yo, youre not even taking food orders, that was literally your only job] - the food coma after the meal"}
{"text":"Service was great, great experience but very pricey for the quality of meat being served. The ribeye never came and filet mignon came around only once and my plate was loaded with top sirloin and flank steak. Drinks were overrated.  I would recommend giving it a try just for the experience but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"great place to be, just sit back and enjoy a complete pampering evening of food, food, food and more food!!  This place is one of the best red meat stops I have ever made in Las Vegas.  The variety, the fun and of course knowing you had better grab those little tongs or else your meat is falling to the floor!!  Priceless and fun experience."}
{"text":"I was beyond disappointed. The waiter frowned upon the coupon that I handed him. I was told to inform the waiter before ordering that there was a coupon. Everything went downhill from there. Service horrible not impressed by the food whatsoever tasteless and extremely pricey. Nobody cared they Shrugged It Off. Well you got one star"}
{"text":"I'm a Brasilian who take pride in good food and I have to say Fogo do chao has surpassed my expectations $80 for my wife and I for lunch and it included 2 Guaranas  Meat selection was awesome and the sides even better  I recommend staying away from the rice and pastas leave room for the meats Over all it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Who woulda thunk it....a Brazilian steak house that is vegetarian friendly! A fellow veg head suggested it, recommended weekday lunch for the price....off we went. They have a very very nice \"salad\" bar. Not like put a bunch of lettuce on your plate, but just nicer. There are several pre made salads...kale and citrus, quinoa, a watermelon salad, pear and endive salad, fancy potato salads, etc. What sets it apart though is the variety of other items....kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, capers, fine cheeses, roasted vegetables, even smoked salmon.  There are so many delicious items, including soup. And they also bring a few small hot plates to your table....plantains, polenta fries, and garlic mashed potatoes.  A pleasant and delicious surprise. About 15 bucks per person. And perfect to take your carnivorous family and not have them say \"you can't eat here can you?\""}
{"text":"What a crazy fun place!! Be prepared to be STUFFED! So many different and wonderful choices of meat. You could go for the salad bar alone!!! All carved meats are juicy and great. Kabob meat was a little dry. Make sure to pace yourself and pair your meats with fresh flavors like jalapeños and fresh tabouli as you will fill up fast on rich foods!! Go and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Went here on their opening week last week for my birthday. It was fantastic. The service was amazing and the food was great. My husband lived in Brazil and this is the most authentic Brazilian steakhouse in America in his opinion . We went to the one downtown last year and we were disappointed. It was dated, the market fresh bar was not fresh, and the service just okay. This location is a night and day difference. The food was so fresh, the ambiance is beautiful, and the service was impeccable. Excited to have this place in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I thought that I was going to like Fogo de Chao a lot more then I did. The idea of the restaurant is obviously very cool and unique. Unlimited amounts of meat and a full salad bar. However, the majority of the steaks all tasted the same and I thought that the majority of the meats were either over seasoned or too salty. The sides that came with the meal were pretty good. We loved the fried bananas and the polenta fries. Mashed potatoes were just okay in my opinion. Salad bar was good. They had a good amount of options. The cheesy bread that is served with the meal was good when it was warm, but when it got cold it wasn't very appetizing. I honestly just think its a little overpriced. If I'm paying 53 bucks then I want to be eating some of the most flavorful meat I've ever had, and this wasn't the case. Service was great though. All of the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here but I wasn't very happy with the prices. The food was good but I've been to other places where it was less expensive and same quality of food in good locations on the strip as well."}
{"text":"Of the Brazilian restaurants in Las Vegas Texas De Brazil wins in the battle against Fogo De Chao, Pampas and Via. Fogo De Chao is still good- I personal like Texas better and this is why:  The salad bar at Texas has more options including two different types of mushrooms on hot and one marinated and cold, Fogo just has the cold ones. Texas has a variety of cheeses to include goat cheese and crostini toast, which Fogo does not. Fogo has bread for the cheese which is fine but I am spoiled by the options at Texas. Texas has two types of asparagus white and green and a delicious Quinoa salad. The main difference however is Texas de Brazils potatoes- their potato salad is better and the also offer scalloped potatoes and lobster bisque which Fogo does not.  Sides: Fogo offers polenta fries which are delicious something Texas does not have, however Texas mashed potatoes beat Fogos hands down any day of the week. When we got the potatoes at Fogo the server was like \"and our delicious garlic potatoes\". now if you are a potato snob like I am you can tell by visual appearance alone if potatoes are from a package- which these were. The consistency was watery and tasted like instant. BUMMER. Texas however, and I say this every time I eat there has the best mashed potatoes! They are so creamy, smooth and delicious. The plantains are equal at both places. Cheese bread- actually I think Fogo  wins on the cheese bread, but Texas is still good.  Meat: Both are equal- I personally think Texas might be seasoned a little better- my friend said that she thought Texas meat was a little more salty.   Service: both places have EXCELLENT service. You will feel welcomed and full. Fogo was extremely prompt. I didnt even notice my friend had flipped her card from Red to Green and the server was already bring us our hot sides and  meat was coming our way- my friend said it was like they heard the air as the card flipped over.   Finally- Price Fogo is a little more expensive. If your just doing salad bar go to Texas I think light lunch there is $19.99 and Fogos is $24.99 full lunch at texas is $26.99 and Fogo is $29.99. Dinner both are around $50.   Side note: When I walked into Fogo's I was hit with the overwhelming smell of meat- which I actually did not enjoy that almost turned me off- There is no meat smell at Texas. Try both see which you like- but personally Ill be at Texas for my Brazilian feasting!!"}
{"text":"I went for my birthday on a friend recommendation. Unique deal here $52.95 per person includes sides and unlimited meat and a large salad bar. This includes perfectly cooked sirloin, lamb chops, leg of lamb, rib eye, filet, tenderloin and chicken. The beef tends to blend in as pretty similar but great and they bring however you like it ... Rare medium rare medium ... Don't know if they serve ruined. They just keep coming with meat until you say done. I overdosed. Definitely recommend for meat lovers and a fun time. Servers and managers all were friendly prompt and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been to Fogo de Chao in Beverly  Hills so I knew what to expect. I think compared to other churrascarias, Fogo tends to be way saltier with their meats. However, the quality of the food met my expectations. I think their salad bar was fresh but wish they had more variety. The service was almost too good in that we had like 5 servers standing around waiting on us. Their hot items are delish and meat is not as salty. And they have this kale/greens side dish that just goes perfectly with the meat!"}
{"text":"Came here for a office meeting and the service was okay. You can tell that there was a rift between to servers. He opened her bill and she yelled please do not open that and put it down he did not do so and she kept repeating it. She went over there and whispered something to him and they walked separate ways. I asked what was in the Brazilian lemonade he had zero knowledge of what ingredients and never showed us  the drink menu. I to find out my self. Ordered desserts and coffee, coffee came out cold and he had our desserts wrong and no garnish on my creme brûlée. I've been here many times and this have never happened so please fix and have your staff be more educated."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day...meal was fantastic...a beef lovers dream come true!  the salad bar was nice, too.  Bartender was exceptional...everything was going great until we went for a trip to the salad bar and  almost tripped over someone with his BARE feet out in the aisle.  disgusting!  told the manager who did go over and tell the person to put his shoes on.  My complaint was with the manager's nonchalant attitude about it...as if everyone does that...no big deal.  I would give the restaurant another two stars but had to knock them down for the mgr's demeanor."}
{"text":"On 03/04/2018, a Sunday, we took our son out to your Scottsdale restaurant for his birthday. I made a reservation (party of 3) for noon and marked the box advising the celebration was for a birthday.    My wife was using a leg cart, and we were seated in the middle of the dining room. She had to weave in and out of tables and had difficulty doing so. The hostes that sat us, waited at the table and watched her struggle between other guests. Rather, she should have thought about the placement of the customer and the difficulty she was having. She dined only from the market place, which was also a struggle to get to and from due to where we were seated. She returned to the market for quiche and a beef dish. To her surprise, ALL three hot dishes were EMPTY.   I stepped away from the table for a moment, my wife and son still there. When I returned, all of the plates and silverware were removed.  One server overheard me commenting to my son, and she asked what the problem was. She brought new plates and silverware back to us, so we could finish our meal.  Never a mention of the birthday. I mentioned it when we received the check, unfortunately spoiling the surprise. My son, detecting my dissatisfaction, declined the now, late offer of a free desert.   The check did not reflect the market place for my wife and we were charged for the Brazilian brunch.  I had the server correct this.  I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied and disappointed in the lack of attention by the employees. Other Fogo de Chao's I have dined in, ran like well oiled machines. The food was always prepared and ready for the customer, and they were attentive.  Scottsdale Fogo fell COMPLETELY flat.    I posted this on their customer site and have not yet (as of 03/14/18) received a response. Here again, this shows me, and hopefully YOU, that they are not concerned with a customers dissatisfaction. I do not recommend going to this restaurant. Truly a disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is much too overrated. Unlimited food doesn't really matter when the food isn't great. All of their different selections of meat have little to no flavor... it just tastes like they sprinkle salt and pepper on everything. The salad bar was like any other salad bar... nothing special. The service is great and that's why I'll give them two stars instead of one. I just don't understand what the hype is all about.   A family member of mine was thinking of having her wedding reception here and after sampling the food - she changed her mind. They also said the waiters wouldn't serve the salad in the private room; everyone has to leave the room and serve their own salad... including her, in her big, fluffy wedding dress. Tacky."}
{"text":"over rated....the salad bar: not exactly exotic ( cucumbers, pees, lettuce --with salt and vinegar)....meat mostly pork the big pieces with too much salt...and the other beef very small portions...and what is this of putting banana (dessert)  and mash potatoes before the main dish???? if i want to spend over 60.00 per person i will go to a real fine dinning place waiters and cutters running up and down : yes running- i don't let children run in my kitchen. tables to close together and between the manager, waiter, cutter and people it crated to much noise to enjoy my \"fine\" dinning experience. two cutters tripped over my moms wheel chair one was very closed to fall down and cut himself (it was one of the cutters).  i put a three because i was very very hungry and got full with the bread. if i have 300.00 for dinner i will sure not return there.  left out they don't offer neither soups or fruits on the salad bar :( only salty black beans and plain hot rice"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a parking lot with ample parking. There is complimentary valet service at the front of the restaurant (don't forget tip).   The people working at valet greeted us and were welcoming. As my girlfriend and I made our way inside, we met the hostess who did not seem too thrilled to see us. She did not smile or say anything until I initiated the conversation by stating that we had a 7pm reservation. The hostess seemed to have trouble locating my reservation even though I made it through their website. We were seated coldly and were told that our waitress would be with us shortly. My girlfriend and I chatted for 10 to 15 minutes but noticed that no one came by to help us. There were several large parties around us and it seemed like we were forgotten. I had to flag a staff member down to mention that no one had helped us yet. She was extremely apologetic and she took care of our drinks. After we got our first plate from the market table, our waitress showed up but at that point there was not much that was needed.   I was very excited to try the various cuts of meat, but I only liked a few. Garlic sirloin was flavorful, but very fatty. The leg of lamb and bacon wrapped beef were delicious. The remaining cuts of meat were extremely dry and tough (Pork sausages, bacon wrapped chicken, house special top sirloin, chicken drums, and flank steak). Ultimately, I was let down by the quality of meat. In addition, some of the cuts were overly seasoned. I sampled each cut several times to get a better base line and noticed that there was a lack of consistency. One time a cut might be more tender/flavorful and other times it was extremely dry/bland. In addition, I noticed that I was offered flank steak and top sirloin at least 8 to 10 times, but other cuts only a few times. The salad bar was pretty good. The quinoa tabouleh and mozzarella caprese salad had a lot of flavor. Smoked salmon was pretty good.  Potato salad and chicken salad was bland and forgettable. Per my girlfriend, the bread rolls were the best thing they offered.   There was one gentleman clearing up our table at the end that was awesome. He seemed genuinely excited to help us and even helped us get our check. I wish I had gotten his name so I could give him more credit. Our waitress was once again MIA when we needed her.    I was expecting a nice dinner with my girlfriend and we had dressed up a bit, but it seemed like it was not necessary. I saw plenty of people walking around in baggy t-shirts, basketball shorts, booty shorts, snap backs, bandanas, etc. Not attire I would associate with an upscale restaurant. Honestly, you could probably come here in workout attire and still fit right in. There were several groups that were overly drunk/yelling over each other.  At the end of the day our bill came out $106.xx - $50 (summer special through facebook) + tip = $80 for 2 people. For $80 dollars, it was meh.... would I spend $110 + tip here, hell no. The meat quality does not match the price point and the ambiance is far from classy. I would much rather pay half that at a casual dinner spot for similar quality. If you want to try good Churrascaria, hit up Agora in Irvine CA, Pampas in Palo Alto CA, or Espetus in San Mateo CA."}
{"text":"Nice meat and extremely nice ambience.  Great place to come with a large party.   Sides are ok but this place is really all about meat."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Both food and service was amazing. I expected more from the salad bar but I was there for the meat anyways so it wasn't a deal breaker. It's pricey so this place is good for special occasions. We will definitely go back. Go hungry!"}
{"text":"Family is a huge fan of this chain. The popovers are nothing short of incredible. Love the bacon wrapped chicken, it's my favorite and they always get it right. Most times I get only the market table and no meat because I'm not much of a meat-eater, but I always hear some great comments about the meats from those I go with. Mashed potatoes and plantains are both delicious too. Unique flavors make for a very tasty meal. Overall a great restaurant for anybody, well worth the cost each and every time."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd best tasting Brazilian steakhouse I've had in Las Vegas. The first being Yolies (the oringinal).  The key is to pace yourself and turn your card over while enjoying what you have before looking around for more. The meat was seasoned well and there are over 14 meats to choose from. I loved the ribs and filet mignon.   PROS:  Ribs               Bottom sirloin               Filet Mignon              The salad bar                CONS: Not enough room in my stomach for everything I want there."}
{"text":"Staff was great. Food was great. Lots of options for any pallet. We spent two hours there on Sunday night sampling all the meat options. Very attentive staff."}
{"text":"The meat here is very good, the only down fall is the salad bar. They have very few items and no soups :( staff is nice, but you can get more for your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Make sure you come hungry! If you're on the Atkins diet you're in the right place. It's a carnivores delight. To start off your meal you'll go to this fantastic antipasto bar. Believe me you could be very happy if this was all you were going to eat but be sure to save room for the meat because there's gonna be lots of it. It just keeps coming. I think they said that they were 17 varieties and having sampled about half they were all excellent. The antipasto bar had an incredible selection of everything you would expect and much more. Check look at a couple of pictures I snapped. Basically it's all you could eat for about 50 bucks, including all the meat. They had a decent wine selection and a full liquor bar. I would definitely go back here and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with a Churrascaria type restaurant. The decor is nice, calming, and the aura is relaxed at this restaurant. You help yourself to the salad bar, which consists of salads, meats (including an awesome candied bacon), cheeses, fruits, veggies, soup, rice, etc). You will get a basket of interesting and tasty rolls at your table as well as mashed potatoes (typical. Nothing special) and something that resembles bananas foster (without the syrup-like topping). When you return to your table, you can choose when you're ready to receive meat! As soon as you turn the coin from red to green, you'll be presented with cuts of meat.  Our waiter was a little absent, which I thought odd because all they do is refill drinks and clear plates. The chefs are attentive, though; whenever our chip was Green-side up, we were inundated with options. I LOVE that we were offered a cut of meat, but then also a choice of how we wanted it cooked (example: there's 3 cuts of sirloin on a skewer and one is medium, one is med-rare, one is rare). They slice a little and you use your personal mini-tongs to grab it!   The meats were all pretty tasty. My favorite was definitely the house sirloin. The lamb was my least favorite, which is surprising because I typically like lamb a lot. This tasted like it had been cross-contaminated with a seafood product, though.  Adults cost approximately $52 for dinner and it includes everything I've described. Desserts, drinks, etc are extra. We did share a creme brulee which was around $9 and it was pretty good. It didn't blow my socks off, bit it was exactly what I wanted (and expected).  All in, I'd give this place another go if I were in a city that had one and I was celebrating something. I think it's a cool experience (Churrascaria restaurant, that is) but it's not something I'd pressure you to do."}
{"text":"Went with a large party, food was good and the service was good too!  Very fun and entertaining!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Fogo but not this night   Although seated promptly the wait after the salad bar was lengthy.  It took 10 minutes just to order beverages then we never saw that server the rest of the time while we were there When the meats started arriving they were almost completely picked over due to the location we were seated.  Not all the meats were even presented.  Finally had to ask for freshly cooked meats in which they provided.    It was not the Fogo I have been accustomed to."}
{"text":"Three words for you...  MEAT ON SWORDS!  When you first arrive, they seat you to the table and explain the epicness that is about to ensue... First you take a trip to a salad bar.. oh no no my friend, do not turn your nose up at this \"salad bar\"... they have freshly made mozzerella, smoked salmon, asparagus... the salad bar is amazing. After you have your fill of the delicious mozerella and ripe tomatoes... the meat feast begins! Guys walk briskly around the restaurant with giant swords of meat.. yes... GIANT SWORDS OF MEAT. If they see your card is on green, they slice you off a big ole chunk of whatever meat you would like. I suggest the lamb, it is amazing.. every piece of meat i tried there was mouth watering and cooked to perfection. I have never been so full my entire life... This is a great place to celebrate your anniversary, or take that special someone out."}
{"text":"NO I DON'T WANT ANY SIRLOIN! Please give me the money meats, and not offer sirloin 10 times first. I regret not sitting in the dining room. Big mistake. The meat jockeys just go to the main dining hall, then give you whatever is picked over. Great food though.."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to finally try Fogo De Chao with my friend after he took me here to eat. I went here for lunch on a Sunday and I didn't know what to expect.  There was no line and the restaurant was fairly empty. I didn't mind, but you would expect a place like Fogo de Chao to be busy, especially on a weekend for lunch, but maybe it's more filled during dinner time. They have the salad bar you can get food from and they provide great service and courtesy bringing around meat and asking if you need anything. It's possible that it was because it was lunch, they didn't have a lot of the selections I was hoping for. Their side dishes that they brought out were really good, the bread, bananas, and mashed potatoes. At Texas de Brazil, the bananas were my favorite part of the meal, and I was hoping the same for Fogo de Chao, but they make their bananas a lot different and not as good in my opinion.   I really think Fogo de Chao is top notch, but I probably went during an off day and during lunch. One thing that is for certain amazing, is the service, and will give me a reason to come back here again."}
{"text":"Endless meat...What's not to love?!?  The service and the food are both awesome. Unlike many other Brazilian BBQ places, their cuts of meat are always of the highest quality and cooked perfectly. While their salad bar is not the biggest (I'm not here for that anyway), the items they have are tasty and fresh. The side dishes they serve (cheese rolls, mashed potatoes, crispy polenta, and caramelized bananas) are all delicious.  I highly recommend their picanha (top sirloin), parmesan pork loin, filet mignon, and their chicken. All of the meats are cooked to perfection and served to your liking (in terms of doneness).  The servers are attentive and make sure that you have what you need. I really appreciate that they will ask if there is a particular meat you would like. All in all, they provided us with a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Over all the place was ok. The fillet mignon was the best piece of meat there. Everything else was ok. The beef ribs were over seasoned with salt and the pork ribs were dry. One cut of the fogo house special was very tough and inedible. The salad bar was ok. Not a whole lot to choose from but I was there for the meat anyways. The sides they brought to the table were good. The fried Polenta sticks were addicting. And, they had my favorite cake on the desert menu! Tres leches! So over all for the price ($50 a person) I think they could have done a better job on the food. The meat especially. Oh the staff was really nice and helpful. One of the waiters even offered to take my sons bottle in the back and wash it for him after he dropped it.  Lol on a side note the people sitting next to us who looked at us all night like we didn't belong there were stealing food and putting it in their purses lol I thought it was funny."}
{"text":"Let me first say I've gone to this particular Fogo for many years and usually had 4 star service. With how packed they usually are, it's virtually impossible for 5 stars. But this past weekend was ridiculous. And I don't typically write so much, but the details are important.  On Friday I made a reservation for 12 friends and kids for 8pm over the phone. My son's and my girlfriend's birthday dinner. We arrived promptly. The young hostess said I had no reservation and would have to wait about 1.5 -2 hours for a table that large. Keeping calm, I asked for a manager.   The manager was very nice and asked if I called the reservation in. I did, so she asked if I could show her my cell phone call log. Happily, I showed her that indeed called the day before, twice. She left for a few minutes and got us a table. Nice job, but beginning my evening with panic and frustration is not something anyone expects. On the way to the table I told her that we had 2 birthdays and she said they would each get birthday deserts on the house. Standard. Cool!  After seating us and taking our drink order, I went to the hostess stand waiting for 1 lagging friend. I spoke to the same hostess about the incident and she said it had been happening many times for the past few months. Obviously someone during the day was not doing their job. And she reiterated that we would be getting birthday deserts.   About half way through our meal we finally received our drinks, except for one of us. It took a while to flag down someone down who turned out to be another manager. He said no problem. At least another 15 minutes went by and no drink. Finally our server came by and said he'd get it. Another 15 went by, almost done meal now, and she got the drink. He had a \"could care less\" attitude and never apologized. He simply picked up their tab and crossed off the drink without telling them. And never asked the rest of us if we wanted additional drinks the entire night. But he never really came by the entire night, except to deal with the one drink.   Additionally we realized that for the 2 hours we were there, there were many meats that never made it our way. The more expensive meats. We were presented with Bottom and Middle Sirloin, and chicken 30 times, but filet, lamb and some others once or never. We had to ask for them to bring them over, which also took time.   Frustrated, but making the best of it and of course stuffed from the food, which was good, we paid and left. No desert ever made it over.   Having had office parties and other get togethers here over the years, I was really taken aback by all of the failures of the evening. They market themselves as a high-end restaurant, and should be judged that way. It may be sometime before I and talked into going back."}
{"text":"Don't fill up on the Salad Bar.  These are great words of wisdom that a friend gave to me many years ago before I went to the Fogo de Chao in Washington D.C.  Good advice.  I eat my salad after the meat.  Meat is the main reason to go to Fogo de Chao.  And it was not disappointing.  But, be sure to vocalize what you want.  Tell the individual with the large sword of meat that you prefer yours Rare or medium rare or burnt.  They will find that for you and bring it to you.  Here it was no exception.    My one complaint was that we ordered a magnum of wine off of the wine list.  After a few minutes, the waiter came over and said they were out of that magnum but here was another that was equally as good.  I asked if the price was the same.  No he answered.  It was $50 more.  I called over the manager, Ryan, to complain.  Ryan admitted that they had been out of that bottle for over a week.  He did not have an answer as to why they couldn't have printed up a new wine list with their laser printer.  And Ryan was somewhat offended when I told him I felt like they were trying to up sell me the other bottle of wine when they didn't offer it to us at the price of the wine that they didn't have.  That said, after Ryan and I discussed the matter we were able to work out an acceptable resolution.  But really, in this day and age of computer inventory and laser printers, can't you have a wine list that is up to date?   That said, we had a great meal.  Meat delivered the way we like it and a cool refreshing salad at the end.  Perfect!  Thank you for a great dinner.  We look forward to your new San Diego location."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for date night. The food is incredible; can't find anything like it anywhere else. Service experience is unique and very fun. Lou, head of customer service, is always on hand to make sure each guest is having a great dinner. Will continue to be a customer! I would highly recommend everyone try this place for a fun date at least once!"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend in for his first time, my third, and the staff and food never cease to amaze me! The staff took very good care of us, especially Rico. He told us it was his day off, but he was in for the shift. We never wanted for anything. Their food is mouthwatering and their drink selections are worldly. We will be faithful guests as long as they stay open."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, and the service is excellent! Great for a special occasion, just don't forget to come hungry."}
{"text":"FOGO or NOGO! wise words i read in a yelp review here.  best steakhouse i"}
{"text":"Excellence as usual!!  Super eager staff that borderline on stfu leave me alone status.  I'm not talking about the meat peoples.  We just got way to many random \"how's errrythings\".  Nice I guess.  I enjoyed alllll the meats.  Especially the bacon wrapped filet.  They had some creative options also.  I like how each meat is cooked in various ways, well, medium, rare.  I'd def go here again!!"}
{"text":"I hate going to a great restaurant and only being able to have one of the many enticing meal options.  However, I hate most buffets as well.  Fogo de Chao is an amazing balance.  Starting with what can only be described as \"bread balls\", these golf ball sized delicacies were a delicious bread course.  You then hit the salad bar and load up on a variety of items not seen on regular salad bars.  When you are ready, you flip a red coaster over to the green side, and miraculously a variety of skewer grilled meats will start visiting your table.  Take a whole steak or lamb or chicken piece, or just have a slice off of what they are offering.  Or not.  The meat kept coming and I kept accepting.  Succulent and tender, beautifully flavoured, cooked to perfection--you couldn't have an empty plate for more than 30 seconds before a highly attentive server would be there to load you up.  After about 20 visits, I was ready to pass on desert, nearly 2 wonderful hours later.  If I was in a hurry, I could have been out in 30 minutes, but why rush ecstasy?  Side dishes included a dish of creamy garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and a third item I forgot.  Make sure you order the drink made with cane liqueur, but pace yourself--they can sneak up on you!"}
{"text":"Just another great meat feast!  This place is pretty consistent among its locations.  As usual, the market table (I can't call it a salad bar) is a meal on its own with excellent options not found on other salad bars.   The sides are included, with Carmelized banana, polenta, cheesy mashed potatoes and of course the gluten free cheese buns are awesome. Order a second basket, and hide them in your purse!  But it's all about the meat, cooked the way you want it, delivered to your table in a constant parade until you finally surrender and turn up the red card.   I finished off with the Key Lime Pie, rich and tasty and not excessively tart. Add in the special Caprina cocktail, and you don't need anything else--except maybe someone to carry you out to your car."}
{"text":"I'm going in with a good solid 4 stars. I will say I went for lunch and only had the salad bar ONLY,  which I might add was a beautiful lunch! the salad bar was only $15!!! .. which was more than plenty and I didn't feel as if I were missing out on all the gorgeous looking meats that came out..(will go back for that sometime for dinner) Great ambience,   Way more personal than Texas de Brazil much more enjoyable,  the servers were more than happy to please.. Good wine list! Great just great!"}
{"text":"Fogo!  How I love you!  Your meats and cheeses make my meats and cheeses happy.  Well, almost.  I've been a staunch fan of Fogo de Chão in Beverly Hills for so long.  The foods are 110% perfect.  Nothing wrong either in service or food.  Never.  Then I came to Scottsdale.  It was good.  But that's about all I can say.  The salad bar was actually better than the meats, which were amazing also.  Delicious pastas and vegetables laid out in a wide variety.  The gauchos who came to our table, along with the waiter/waitress staff, were great.  Very helpful, friendly and courteous.  The meats, however, just didn't match up with Beverly Hills.  Again, that's not saying something was wrong, they just weren't as good.  The Picanha (house special awesomeness meat) was good, but was lacking whatever magic put it on the map.    I'm not disappointed, but for $150 for 2 people, I was actually hoping for better.  In fact, I was actually turned off from enjoying their famous Crème Brûlée.  Le Sigh."}
{"text":"I have Been to 3 Fogo locations and always have a good meal.  Of course some or more solid than others but all are pretty consistent.  This location had one of the most attentive staffs compared to Vegas, and KC.  Drinks were nice and cold and though it was a bit expensive I'd say it's worth every penny. Fresh free fresh meat!!!!   Pause!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here on Father's Day, after hearing a lot of positive reviews. We usually go to Texas De Brazil, but thought we give this place a chance. Big mistake ! The place was packed, and service was super slow. We were past the first plate of food before the waiter even showed up to take drink orders or get sides (of which there are only plain mashed potatoes, super bland fried polenta, or sweet bananas. The salad bar was nothing special, with the only items of notice being the smoked salmon and the candied bacon. The rest was rather blah. But we're here for the meat, right ? First to the table was the bacon wrapped chicken that was so over cooked that it was totally inedible. Two later attempts from different skewers were better, but still very dry.  Pretty much none of the meat cuts were the requested temperature. I kept asking for medium rare, and half the pieces I got were rare or completely raw. I switched to asking for medium, and got either rare or well done. Biggest disappointment was the filet mignon. Early on, a guy showed up with three pieces left, one for each of our party. It was tough and full of gristle, not like any filet I've ever seen. This was the only time filet mignon ever made it to our table. \"Holiday Pricing\" for this debacle was $55. With one drink and one desert each, we ended up at $100 per head incl tax and tip - outrageous for the quality of food and service.  I don't even know why I gave this place 2 stars. I guess the candied bacon and the caipirinhas were ok."}
{"text":"Good food, exelent service. We enjoy all the time. For those meat lovers is a place to be in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service! The servers go above and beyond! The salad bar is delicious. The meat is very good however other Brazil steakhouses I have been to do have a little more selection. The atmosphere is also more laid back and not so hectic, which I loved. Overall the food and the service together are enough for me to make this one my choice!"}
{"text":"We had a charity fundraiser today with 180 attending. The service was impeccable,  the food fantastic and they helped us raise thousand$ for our medical mission. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. The service the food the ambience all of it. I've eaten at other restaurants of this brand but this is the best by far. Tender meat beautiful buffet and good wine. A tad pricy but I have gone here three times and this place has yet to be disappointing. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I went here for my friends birthday dinner and I don't know if people hyped this place up to much but it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.   The restaurant is in a nice area and very easy to find. Its an upscale place so people were dressed up but I also saw people who were dressed very casual too. We were with a large party so we were seated in the back room the restaurant. It was obviously our first time here and nobody explained or came around to our table for a good 20 min. Finally we had to wave a waiter down to get our dinner started.  The dinner comes in two phases. First the salad bar and then the meat. They give you a two sided red/green coaster which you use to control to pace of how much meat you get. The salad bar is amazing and had a lot of variety. I recommend you take it easy your first round so you can have room for the meat. When your ready the meat carvers come around and cut the meat for you. I really enjoyed the lamb, filet mignon and the bacon wrapped chicken. I recommend you take your time eating the meat and not get everything all at once. The meat doesn't taste very good when it's cold so before trying a different meat finish the meat on your plate.  Overall the restaurant was nice, the food was good and we got free dessert because it was our friends birthday. My friends got to pick any dessert from the menu and the rest of our party got to pick either a cheesecake, chocolate moose and something else ( I can't remember lol).  They loose a star because it was our first time and nobody came around to our table to explain how everything works until we flagged someone down. It also took them a while for the meat to come around to our table."}
{"text":"Love eating at Fogo... their meats are very flavorful n their salad bar delicious fresh mozzarella, asparagus, fruit salad excellent selection lots to chose from...The servers are very nice n always on point when u need to get ur different kind of meats"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on our last night of Vegas vacation. The salad bar was good. The meat itself was a-ok, but a rather limited selection compared to other Brazilian steakhouses in San Diego or San Francisco.  Fogo is said to be coming to Santana Row in San Jose early in 2014 so I'm waiting to go check them out and give them another try."}
{"text":"Meat, mo meat, all kindz of meat.. This place is meat heaven i just dont understand why they have a salad bar but thays just me...polenta is killer , fried banana is excellent and the cheese bread,.. Addictive.. Ribeye, wow... I took my friend here ( hes a meat guy) he dubbed it \"best meal ever\"... Pork ribs are awesome too.. I literally got drunk from eating meat here( real talk) $52 not bad at all for dinner in Las Vegas..two tips ,: take metamucil or something and maybe a lipitor.. Dontbworry itll be worth it..."}
{"text":"This place has the best happy hour. HH is from 4:30p-6:30p and it is delicious and a great value. They only have 5 food items and all are really good. The sliders are delicious! They are delicious, tender and the bread is amazing!! (Side note: get a basket of the cheese bread, it is complimentary, but hands down, one of the best things they serve!) The tenderloin sliders are amazing! You get two huge pieces of perfectly cooked, quality tenderloin for $9 with a side of killer chimichurri sauce. The manager brought the board out, which we hadn't ordered, and the prosciutto, salami and dates were delicious. We only ordered the other 4 items and the manager didn't want us to miss out on trying the fifth item. The fries and dip were good, just not high up in the list of priority going up against the meat dishes. The drinks were equally good. Try their signature drink with a \"Brazilian rum\" it is really good. We've come here for dinner and it is delicious, although I am not entirely happy with the seafood options or the salad bar (Texas de Brazil is way better on this front). However, Fogo's  quality of meat is way better!"}
{"text":"This is the best Brazilian food ever! I've been to Portugal and they have something similar and this was as if I was back there. It was perfectly cooked meat none stop! Great service and friendly staff. They treat you well if you've never been to a place like it. We gave ourselves the meat sweats that night!  Slap yo mama good. For real"}
{"text":"We had such a good experience , food was great , service was amazing , our server Marcos was pleasant and the manager Marco was very hands on . Will def go back and bring our family . Salad bar was fresh and the meat was right on time . I'm a happy customer"}
{"text":"Best Brazilian Restaurant in Vegas hands down. I recommend starting out with a traditional Brazilian drink, the Caipirinha. It consists of fresh limes muddled with sugar and Cachaça, a Brazilian rum that has a slight tequila taste. they have many varieties of this drink on their cocktail menu. The salad bar... over 30 items ranging from salads to fresh cut salmon, grilled veggies and various side dishes.  The meat... my favorite was the fillet. Amazing flavor, no need for steak sauce here! With 12 different meats there's something for everyone. I highly recommend trying this place. At 50$ a plate its well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to this joint probably four times... and the only thing holding it back from a five star rating is the price.  I get it - you're offering unlimited prime meats - but that doesn't mean you should charge $16 for a 10 ounce cocktail.  Was it good? Yeah... but for that price it should be twice the freaking size.  C'mon.  The salad bar is spectacular... offering an array of Brazilian appetizers.  They bring fried bananas and pao de quiejo to the table as often as you'd like (tiny rolls baked with cheese in 'em that are just incredible.  The lunch offering, while not as plentiful as the dinner (in regards to the variety of meats they bring around) is half the price ($30'ish vs. $60'ish) and the only way to go in my opinion.  My favorite (even when I lived in Brazil) is the picanha - perfectly seasoned and medium rare, the way meat should be eaten.  Yesterday the pork and chicken wrapped in bacon weren't as tender or juicy as they've been in the past, but all the beef offerings were out of this world good.   The rice / bans / farofa remind me of the time I spent in Brazil and you must get a can of guarana for nostaligia's sake (their most popular soda - kind of tastes like cherry ginger ale).  The service is always solid and a few of the meat servers were actually from Brazil so I also got to practice my Portuguese too.  I'll be back, but only on rare occasions to celebrate something... word on the street is Rodizio is opening somewhere in the east valley and with their cheaper prices they'll certainly compete in this underrated foodie arena."}
{"text":"Holy meaty deliciousness. I can't believe I've waited so long to try this place. It blows away any other Brazilian steakhouse.   Let's start with the salad bar. There's a make your own Caesar Salad with Parmigiano Reggiano, you can have it shredded or grated. I went with both. It was so good.   Some other options on the salad bar that I really liked, full artichoke bottoms, Peppadew peppers, Aged Manchego Cheese, Baby Swiss Cheese and marinated mushrooms. I tried to limit the salad bar to one small plate to safe room for the good stuff.   I almost missed the bread on the table. I'm not sure how something so small can be so yummy. It just looks like a little biscuit, but you definitely have to try it. Somehow it basically melts in your mouth leaving hints of cheesy, buttery bread deliciousness floating all over your tongue. Make sure to eat them while they are hot.   Side dishes: The fried polenta was actually really good. I've never had it before, but somehow I'm positive that no other place will make them this good. Garlic mashed was also pretty good, as were the caramelized bananas.   The Meats:   Top Sirloin (Picanha) very tasty. I preferred the garlic seasoned version, but both were good.   Ribeye (Beef Ancho) My favorite of the meats... It's just so delicious. It seriously melts in your mouth. The flavor dances all over your tongue. I can't even explain it.   Lamb (Cordeiro) The lamb was very tender and had a very subtle flavor.   Flank Steak (Fraldinha - Bottom Sirloin) I think  2nd favorite. It was so tender and seasoned perfectly.   Each cut of meat is more delicious than the last. This place is so good. To top of the dinner we ordered the Flan. It was drenched in creamy caramel and whipped cream. It was exquisite.   The service here is absolutely superb. My water was never empty. The minute you flip your card over to show that you would like a new selection of meat, one of the carvers is by your side. Our server made sure we always had fresh bread and replenished our sides as needed. I felt like everyone in the place was concentrated on making sure I had everything. Next time I go back I'd like to try the Filet and the beef ribs."}
{"text":"Well, I have to call it like I see it and it was not all that great like everyone says. Our hostess wasn't very cheerful, it seemed like she is working several jobs and is tired. When she asked if we knew the dining procedures and we said we did, it seemed like she was relieved that she didn't have to explain the concept. The night we dined it seemed like we didn't have an actual waiter but someone that was attending to our table and taking away finished plates. The meal starts off with the salad bar and the first thing you experience is the dishes are hot from the dishwashing machine. Presentation at the salad bar was lacking compared to the \"other\" Brazilian place further south of the Las Vegas strip. The soup of the day was asparagus, but is there a sign for it? no, but there are 2 raw asparagus spears laying next to the soup container to give you a hint. The soup tasted funny, like it was pea soup instead. Funny taste, not too much fun involved though. Salad bar was messy and they need someone to keep it maintained, people drop things and no one is around to keep it looking nice.  The flavors was not all that good either, the cheese was either hard or mushy depending on what you picked. The specialty cheese had no flavor and the swiss cheese was just hard as a rock. I think it was mozzarella cheese, but it was like a wet marshmellow and gooey. Platters of salad items laying on hard ice and no real presentation at all. A pair of salad tongs laying inside the lettuce after someone had used it. Blah! There was a pan of bacon that was really tasty, but it seemed more of a breakfast item, but it was there and it was good. The guachos with the meats were kind of aggressive here like they are on commission to get rid of the meat, often my red/green card was flipped to red (no meat please) and they would still ask if you wanted what they had to offer. I was like what good is the card if the server isn't paying attention to it? Chicken wrapped in bacon wasn't good, the chicken was dry and over cooked, the other various meats were either bland or extremely salty.  We struggled through what they brought us and ate what we could. I saw sausages go by a few times, but it never arrived at our table and someone in our party actually had to ask for some to be brought over. As our dinner was coming to an end a gaucho brought over some rib eye steak that I thought was good, but where was it when we first started to eat? Overall for the same price the other place further south is much better."}
{"text":"Tonight in Vegas was simply wonderful... I could not give it a higher award. They were superb in terms of meeting our every want for service. The food was one of the best that I have ever enjoyed. It was cooked however we wished and the meat was juicy and very nicely seasoned for every bite.  The atmosphere was great.... You can tell this is not a well kept secret... It was early on a Tuesday night and it was quite busy, but nothing was compromised in terms of food or service. By the way, the cheesy bread is killer!! The customer service rep (Ricardo) took extra special attention with us to make sure everything was perfect!  He offered great advice and gave us excellent information about the restaurant. Any out of town guests will certainly be escorted back here!! I enjoyed this location better than the one in Portland (which was also quite good!)"}
{"text":"If you're into endless amount of meats this  is the place. Unfortunately, while I enjoy meat I can only possibly consume so much and that happens to not be worth the cost of this place.   Somethings I didn't realize, I knew it would be pricey. But I thought for the price I would be served completely. The marketplace (salad bar) is one big mess of hungry people trying to fill up their plates. It's all cold items which really jerked me. I would have been happy with a nice side salad brought to my table instead of cutting in front of people at the salad bar. And it was all pretty meh stuff. There are a couple different soups I think. But that's it. Go back to sit down and then the meats roll in.  The meats were delicious, they bring three sides of what taste like instant mash potatoes and look like them too. Fried polenta was good, but we only got three sticks for both of us. The third side is plantain. I didn't try it, don't into warm bananas.  While I can see what the rave is about due to the endless meat, $140 dollars later I was very unhappy. It felt very hectic instead of just enjoying great food. We had buyers remorse."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of dining here after my boyfriend, Elmer Abapo, performed there in the evening for a few hours. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. If you're a total meat lover, this is your place to go! Different types of meat came out every several minutes and you have the choice of allowing them to place more on your plate or pass, by using this card that is placed on your table. Red, for pass, and green for, keep em comin'! It's all you can eat, to your heart's content.   You have the option of dining inside or outside, where the musicians perform if there is anyone scheduled that evening. Inside, you will find LOTS of tables, so seating shouldn't be difficult. There is also an area where you can choose salads and small side dishes.  Personally, I'm not a fan of buffet style foods and tons of meat, but I'm still grateful for the experience. Although I don't think I will eat here again, simply because it isn't my taste, I do think that the food and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined at several Fogo de Chao outposts (Minneapolis, Baltimore, and now Las Vegas) and this is definitely the best (which is saying something since they've all been excellent).  Our party of six stopped in for New Year's Eve dinner via a reservation made on opentable.  Our booking was for 6 p.m. and upon arrival we were seated promptly, with water brought and drink orders taken in short order.  This is the start of what would be a night of outstanding service at Fodo de Chao.   We begin our meal with the amazing salad bar, which is stocked to bursting without standing veggies, salads, and other delightful options.  Everything our party tried from the salad bar was fabulous.  With our salads consumed, we turned to the main event--the meat (and of course the accompanying sides).  The excellent wait staff at Fogo de Chao made sure that, when our cards were set to go, the meat came around quickly and continuously.   Everything we tried was delicious, with the fillet mignon, lamb and pork being particular highlights.  The sides were, as always, amazing.  I particularly enjoyed the fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheesy bread, but it was all good.   This restaurant also offers some excellent cocktails - with the cranberry cosmo a particular favorite.  And as I've said again and again, the service was outstanding.  This is the level of service that all Las Vegas restaurants should I aspire too, and I just can't say enough good things about the excellent team at Fogo de Chao who took care of us on New Year's Eve.  Overall, this was a dining highlight for us, and our family visiting from Australia, and we all had an amazing evening."}
{"text":"A staple popular steakhouse from what I know.  This chain is more than popular everywhere you go.    They definitely have it down when it comes to serving up \"Meat\" of all sorts.  My favorite was the bottom sirloin and the second runner up was the rib eye.  Most of the meats were cooked to perfection and juicy while some were over cooked.  The chicken was definitely over cooked and dry.    They have a nice salad bar cause truthfully after a while you want some greens in your diet so much appreciated.  They had everything from kale to apple salads to freshen up your palate.    Overall, a nice sit down dining experience and afterwards I hope some of you are like me.  I felt like running it off! -Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Took my guy here for his birthday and he fell in love. The salad bar is out of this world. It's Mediterranean style with  different fresh cheeses, fruits, and salads. The waiters come around with copious amounts of meat that they slice fresh right onto your plate. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night! Wonderful service, and the meat was delicious! Although I am a huge sweets person so of course, we order dessert after our meal... I had the chocolate molten cake, and my date had the tres leches cake.  Both were to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Fogo De Chao was the first churrascaria I had eaten at many years ago back in Dallas. The first time you experience one, you'll understand why the eateries are near and dear to many people's hearts. At these Brazilian steakhouses, gauchos encircle your table to offer you various delectable cuts of beef, lamb, chicken and pork. The format is no-menu, single fee, all-you-can-eat extravaganza.  The price at this Fogo in particular as of this writing here in Phoenix is $42.50 per person, which is a bargain considering the amount and quality of food offered. Once you're seated, you're offered drinks and then you're free to immediately indulge in one of the most high-class 'salad bar' experience you'll ever have. Really, calling it that doesn't do it any justice.  After you've had your fill of vegetation and the like, you may begin the onslaught of meat. There is a small card that is next to you that you flip to 'green' to attract the gauchos and 'red' when you'd like to take a break. Come to Fogo expecting to practice gluttony. You will savor mouth-watering cuts of meat including fillet, top and bottom sirloin, lamb chops, leg of lamb, bacon wrapped fillet and bacon-wrapped chicken, pork sausage and ribs and others. They're all exceptional though you may like some things more than others.  There are a few words of warning. You will consume a lot of food. The meats are highly salted to bring out the most of their flavor and the beef is cooked to the rare side. In short, this is not a health food experience. This is for the meat lover in a meat-eating mood.  You can feel free to intersperse the vegetables at the salad bar while eating the meat. As well, a few sides are provided: garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and fried bananas. Fogo has many fine deserts though I tend to stick with the recommended Papaya Cream, which is a lighter fare after consuming pounds of meat.  As for the rest of Fogo, the setting is noisy but gorgeous. There's always a festive atmosphere about the place. With all the hustle and bustle occasionally, you might be overwhelmed and you might be forgotten about for a few minutes... unless your card is 'green'!  Overall, Fogo offers good value for money, an excellent setting and an unbeatable churrascaria experience. Probably my favorite restaurant of all time."}
{"text":"SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  Everyone else has written about the meat and the salad bar so I will focus on dessert.  1. Brazilian Flan...  I can't describe how creamy and smooth this is.  Sometime flans are too eggy flavored.  But not here. Just smooth, firm, silky flan.    2. Molten lava cake.... normally, this would be #1 dessert on my list. At Fogo, the flan just edges out this classic melty, chocolatey, gooey, stick to your ribs, goodness on a plate.  3. Chocolate mousse...  layered mousse goodness. Its good but a distant 3rd.   3. key lime pie...  tied for 3rd. its good.  4. Creme brulee.  you would think that this would be as good as the flan but its just missing something that would elevate it.  sorry...I could only review five desserts. Need to invite more friends to next dinner at Fogo."}
{"text":"Went to the Grand opening in Summerlin & the food, service,  atmosphere, was spectacular. It's always a treat when you can enjoy great restaurants off the strip. The Grand opening was a success, moving forward,  it was obvious the next time I will have to make a reservation.  Great job!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Fogo for more than 10 years and have always enjoyed my meal, until recently. The last 2 visits at the Scottsdale location have been sub-par. The salad bar is still good, however too many times they either did not have or ran out of smoked salmon. My last visit was on Christmas day. The web site said regular dinner prices, however, once at the restaurant they were charging more. The disappointment comes with the meat. Most selections were tough and dry. They did not have the baby lamb chops as usual and the overall quality of the meats has gone down. The service has also gone down. I never had to ask for the sides that automatically come with the meal. I've had to ask the last few times and they did not refill either the bread or bananas. I ended the meal with coffee and my coffee was not refilled. I had to wait and ask for a refill. I don't mind spending over a hundred dollars for a meal if it's good, but Fogo no longer fits that bill."}
{"text":"Another awesome dinner. My daughter had the Chilean sea bass and it was the best piece of fish I've ever tried."}
{"text":"Wonderful everything: outstanding salads, lovely meats (okay, some were more gristly than others), good service. Advice is to arrive early b/c it will fill up, and in time for half price drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Met a gal pal there the other day for happy hour.  WOW!  HUGE \"salad bar\" in the dining room.  We sat in the bar, scanned the HH menu and decided on the cucumber mint smash drink.   I had mine sans mint and cucumber.   She had hers sans cucumber.  Spencer was our bartender/server.   A very helpful, efficient, professional, and friendly person, that is for sure.   My drink was a bit on the tart side I am assuming without the cucumber and mint.   (A \"bit\" is an understatement!   It was like sucking on a lemon!)  Spencer was kind enough to suggest more simple syrup, which he added, and it was just perfect after that.  We decided on the Brazilian empanadas, the polenta fries and the beef rib sliders from the HH menu.   We were initially served four cute little buns that were quite tasty and took the edge off of my hunger.  I didn't try the sliders but ate the fries and the empanadas.   The fries were okay.   I mean, nothing particularly special stood out.   The empanadas were over fried in my opinion and not much meat inside.   In fact, we left some of the fries and a couple of the empanadas (four are served) on our plates, and I am NOT one to waste food, usually taking home leftovers to eat the next day.  I would have given it two stars for the food, but am giving the extra star for the ambience and service.   Would I go back?   Maybe to try the main dining room albeit I am not one to usually get food from a \"salad bar\" because of the way it is laid out."}
{"text":"Food is delish! I have been to Brazilian bull and there is a huge difference. Fogo de chao is double the price but double the goodness!"}
{"text":"This is definitely an experience worth trying. My sweetheart took me here for Valentine's day dinner. We are both on a low carb diet and from our research, this looked like a perfect fit.   The restaurant was table cloth and most of the people were dressed for the occasion. We were seated in the side room in the corner. This had the advantage of being quiet and privet, but had the disadvantage of being super far from the fancy salad bar. We made one trip out to it. It was a low carb candy bowl of cheeses, meats, and veggies. I grabbed a little of everything.   At the table,  the servers brought the meats. You tell them your preferred doneness and they slice it off the main shank for you. I had some nice fatty cuts and some very tender rare cuts of steak. They also brought some other sides to eat but they were bread, so sadly we couldn't eat them.   Everything tasted so wonderful that we got caught up in the moment. Having server after server stop by. Before we knew it, we had a nice line up of meats. We quickly made it through all the tasty cuts.   One thing I regret is that we got full eating too quickly. We should have slowed down. It's a pricy bill, but nice quality at all you can eat. Basically a Vegas buffet. Also the tables were really close together which made it hard to walk through. I don't know if this was for the holiday or if that's the normal layout.  Great for special occasions."}
{"text":"Finally, I get a chance to try the legendary Fogo de Chao. As far as Brazilian Steakhouse's go, this place is the best I have ever tried, and it thus earns an easy 5 stars from me. We came for lunch to maximize our value, and we came HUNGRY. Let's get to the reviewing!  The salad bar has mostly what you'd expect at such a place. A good selection of green leafy vegetables is what I recommend because it's healthy and keeps you from filling up too much before the good stuff. The cold mushrooms and asparagus are both decent options. They have those spicy little red peppers that I enjoy, as well as a decent selection of cheeses.   The mashed potatoes side arrived shortly and wasn't extraordinary but decent. Once the meat began to arrive, it was pretty relentless. I loved the sirloin steak, medium or less. The Flank steak was surprisingly juicy and tasty as well. I love that they often offer multiple levels of cooked for the customers, and if you want something rare that they don't have, they will simply make some more for you promptly. You'll want to try the lamb steak but the lamb chop wasn't particularly impressive. I probably ate 3 orders of the signature fogo cut, which has just the right amount of pink throughout the cut. The garlic sirloin is also delectable, without being overly flavored. I went crazy for the rib eye just as I was reaching maximum fullness.  The service is very good here-- they seem to take their reputation seriously as the premier Brazillian BBQ in clark county and they treat you with respect and care. You won't find better in this town, and hence they get the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely remarkable. Being a certified carnivore hungry for all sorts of exotic animal flesh, Fogo de Chao delivered an array of finely cooked meats that allowed me to indulge my primal desires. Those meats were paired with healthy servings of mashed potatoes, fried plantains, and a salad bar filled with all sorts of green foliage I merely looked at. I cannot recommend this restaurant or the experience it offers enough."}
{"text":"Best Salad-bar Ever...  My wife doesn't eat meat, and walked away from this place full, happy and content. She liked the smoked salmon, the fresh black beans and the veggies and salads available.   Meats are cooked to perfection and the servers know what they're hauling around. The manager came to our table and talked with us for a while about what they do there and what they're trying to go for.   I've been here twice on business trips and as a non-regular meat eater (former vegetarian) I will come here again... which usually means having a month's worth of animal products in a few hours.   FYI, they don't rush you... which is good. Great Brazilian attitude. Come in, sit down, graze, drink and socialize. This is not a place to come before a movie or to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"If you have never eaten at a Brazilian churrascaria this place is a pretty good representation of one. Word to the wise...... get ready for a mass intake of meat products.   The menu here is non existent. You sit down, order some beverages, and get down and dirty. The salad bar here is definitely above par for the course (to all of you golfers: the salad bar just shot a 69 at Augusta). I think it had thirty five or so items to excite the palate. Now don't fill up with all of that rabbit food because the next stop is protein town, population you. In my mind I said \"bring on the beef!\" I think that message was picked up subliminally by every waiter in the joint. The moment I was done with my salad our table was surrounded by beautiful glistening beef, lamb, chicken, even a little pork. I made the fatal mistake of thinking I could  try a little of everything. At the end of the meal I was so overloaded with meat products I almost passed out at the table. The quality of the meat and flavors was top notch and highly recommended.  I guess I should also note the service was fantastic. All of the meats are made to order. The lamb was a little over done for my taste and they had a fresh skewer of rare meat out in a flash. All of the drinks were full and the house had a pretty good wine selection."}
{"text":"This place is great, Jose Ruiz made our experience an amazing one. Will definitely be coming back again"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  Came for restaurant week, which offered a discounted meal price (excluding some of the more premium meat cuts) but included salad bar and even one dessert!  Service here is five-star for sure, the servers are very attentive and professional. The interior is also gorgeous and very elaborately decorated. It's a very upscale, yet comfortable dining environment.  As for the food, the meat is delicious, perfectly seasoned and a lot of very tasty offerings. The salad bar is solid, but I think I prefer Texas de Brazil's salad bar.  Since a lot of the restaurant week dessert options were out, the manager was kind enough to let us have anything off of the regular dessert menu, so I opted for the creme brulee, which was excellent.   Overall, an excellent Brazilian steakhouse and a great place to come for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Not the best visit this time around. Most of our meats in addition to the rolls were all over done and dried out. Conversely, the bananas were underdone and nowhere near their caramelized best.  The service was also spotty (though well-intentioned) with requests having to be repeated and a 20 minute wait for our bill as lunch was quietly winding down. We'll be back and know we'll have sharper service again, but this visit was a bit of a miss."}
{"text":"Over all great experience. We made reservations months ago for 7 people. We arrived about 20 minutes early and were seated immediately. John our waiter was on top of everything. Food was great. Maybe could of had a little better selection at the salad bar, but let's not kid ourselves, who goes here for the salad bar??  My daughters first experience at this type of restaurant And she loved it.  Bring a fat wallet, you will need it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I've never been to anything like it. If you are in the mood for meet then this is the place for you. Even if you aren't they have an amazing Salad Bar. Make sure not to fill up on salad though as you wont be disappointed by the selection of meats that await you."}
{"text":"\"Meat buffets\" are an annual treat for me. Fogo de Chão was a new experience, and certainly better than other Barzilian steakhouses I've tired.   I can't recall all the names of the meat I devoured. At some point during the experience, I just agreed to try everything that arrived at our table. However, I can say this: Much of the meat was tender and tasty. Although bacon is bomb, the bacon wrapped meat here was unsatisfying. Unlike other similar restaurants, side dishes such as fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and polenta sticks accompany the meal.   The salad bar had a great selection of salads and veggies. Plus, there was also a charcuterie section. Soup was also available, as well as (cold) cornbread.  Tip: Make a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"Basically, unlimited steak. If you like steak, you will like this place.  One of the guys also took the time to show us around the wine room. It was pretty cool."}
{"text":"So good. Just delicious. I have been to fogo de chão before but this location was amazing. Me and a buddy got there a lil early about 530pm which is a lil after opening so there were a few people therw but we had the run of the place.   Everyone and I mean everyone was amazing. From the hostess the minute we walked in, to the guys that kept bringing food to our table. Absolutely wonderful experience, we sat for about two hours and never turned anyone away.  The card that they give you green for keep the food coming and red for I need to catch my breath. Never was flipped to red.  Everything came out still sizzling from the kitchen even after an hour of us being there and the place got packed. The service never diminished in anyway. We worked our way through chicken wings, rack of lamb, lamb shoulder, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, rib eye, pork sausage, prime rib and so much more at a point we were in a food daze.   Finally we hit our limit. Got our bill which was amazingly cheap in comparison to other places in vegas for the amount and quality of food, and then we struggled to our feet and out the door.   Well worth the experience. The food was beyond delicious and you will wanna try everything twice.  Go and eat and dont forget too loosen your belt before you go in.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is a place that after you eat here; you put your craving to meat on hold for sometime. It has really nice selection if meat, I am a big fan of lamb and I got plenty :) Pros: lots of meat, salad, ambiance Cons: the meat is extremely salty, I thought I will get an hearth attack :) 2 people with 2 martinis we paid roughly 120$ so a bit pricey :)"}
{"text":"Good Brazilian Beers and Great food.  Service was on the spot.  Love it!"}
{"text":"The perfect choice for a great dining experience.  Made a 7:30 reservation on a Friday night and we got there early and got seated right away. Salad bar was a great start and even had fresh haddock. Then on to the main course. My wife and I have been to these types of high end steak places and the best tip I can give you is hold out for the meat choice you really want. We love filet mignon and the bacon wrapped chicken, but it all tastes great... As it should for $50 per person."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience all the way around.  The food was great and the service was unbelievable.  Every meat we tried was spectacular.  Don't miss this location.  The whole party had a blast."}
{"text":"I took my family here for my sister's going away trip as she was moving out of state for a new job.   There was a decent amount of parking here. The front of the place is pretty open with a turn...I think during the weekends, they probably have valet here.   The inside is very spacious and is pretty good for group celebrations of a romantic dinner. There is a bar area to the side that seems pretty quiet and cozy for those intimate dinners.  They have quite a lot of wine in their selection. Walking in, you can see their wine gallery.   What can I say about their food. It is delicious. There is a lot of it. There is also a salad bar and it's pretty good but let's be honest here...you didn't come here for salad. I ate a lot of the filet mignon. It was good. There was lamb, delicious. I don't think I can say anything bad about this place at all. The service was fast.  The pricing...well, you're in a brazillian steak house in Scottsdale so, yeah.   I would come back here again but I wouldn't make it a usual stop. I could get a coronary with all the yellow gold flowing through my veins already."}
{"text":"I have been to a Brazilian steakhouse before and this one was just as good as the one I went to in DC. The service was outstanding. The food was unbelievable. All the meats were good but my favorite was the filet mignon. It just melted in your mouth! I am drooling just thinking about it. We ordered a bottle of red that was so good. It went perfectly with all of the meat we were eating. How we had room for dessert is beyond me but the hot molten cake and the tres leches, wow!  The cheese knots were addictive and my waiter even snuck me a little box full of them at the end of the night. I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I am quite disappointed with my last visit during restaurant week.. I've been coming here for the last 3 years, from the first time to the last, boy was there a huge difference! Three years ago I came in for my birthday and had this fun amazing server who stuck by my table and up sold the crap out of us, but he was so great at it that it was just like \"take my money, and stick around!\" -definitely would had given him a 5 star alone!  This last Saturday for restaurant week was very different [ hope it wasn't different because of restaurant week]. We were greeted by a male server, he went through the process for my parents and spouse, and told us how everyones our server, we ordered a drink and went straight to the salad bar. After we finished our greens, we immediately turned over that nice little red card to green! All the delicious meats were coming to our table, but our waters and drink were low, couldn't find our original server or the water person, so we had to flag someone down.   One of the carvers brought over I believe it was their pork sausage, I took one and my spouse took one, then right before I bit into mine I hear my BF ask the carver \" Umm sir can I get another one that's not stuffed with hair?\" The guy looked back but didn't come back so I called for him again, he came back and we were trying to explain the situation to him and he just gave us another sausage, and of course the water guy is just standing there frozen, looking at our plate with what looks like hair on it then looks at us, then walks off.. we asked the carver to grab a server or manager, but he walks off, so we had to flag down a server ourselves. Danya was the first server to actually respond to our situation even though other servers were standing near by doing nothing and we couldn't get their attention. We explained to her what had happened, and I'm sure this has rarely happened [I hope] and asked for her to remove the plate and just get us a new one... few seconds later a manager came over to apologize and explain to us how they grill everything on an open flame and sometime bristles debris can land on top of their meat.   Well that's great to hear, but the problem was it looked like coarse long black hair and it was INSIDE of the sausage, not on top or wrapped around it, he then went on to explain how he doesn't know how that could have happened since there weren't any female chefs on... regardless we just wanted an apology, a new plate and just for them to know to keep a closer eye on their food because it was one of the most disturbing things I've seen at a restaurant. The manager then gave my BF the option to order anything off the regular dessert menu, by this time he kind of lost his appetite already which was unfortunate... we ended up getting the Tres Leche cake option and Creme Brule.  All in all this visit didn't leave my parents or BF with the greatest first time experience...  SIDE NOTE*** All the servers pool tips, but I honestly only saw Danya, a dirty blonde gentleman and someone who looked like he was watching over the servers, working and attending to customers. Our original server who greeted us just stood to the side and chatted for the whole hour we were there, only time he even did anything was when we got his attention and asked for a fresh plate and when he initially greeted us...   I honestly didn't think it was fair to see some of the servers working harder than others and having to split tips with the lazier ones, I even tried personally handing one of them money and thanking them for being so attentive with us, but this person respectfully declined...   Not too sure if I'll ever come back during restaurant week again.. but might continue giving this place another shot, because the food is pretty good here, but when paying about $50 a head, I expect great customer service as well."}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing!  The fried polenta is very tasty and if you have room for dessert try the Papaya Cream..."}
{"text":"Service was phenomenal and food was so great what a wonderful experience  Melissa  Christoph,Norma, Dulce, James, Antonio, Tiffany, Tyler,& Brian was over the top. It was so awesome to know people and not just get served from the kitchen with a waiter or waitress, we got served from people, it's a nice pace for a different place for the Redmond's. Dope, Dope place."}
{"text":"Great place amazing service.   Ever meat they served was awesome.  Not one complaint.  Nice place off the main strip."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to go here for my dad's 60th birthday. I was excited to try a new restaurant. The service was amazing! We had waiters and people with meat coming constantly so bravo on service. The salad bar was good but nothing spectacular for the price. I also didn't enjoy every meat option I had (I had 8 out of 12). I remember the lamb being disappointing. I left the restaurant extremely full but not extremely satisfied. I'm glad I tried it but honestly, this place isn't for me."}
{"text":"What a great place. We went late on a Saturday night and got seated right away. The waiter was attentive and quick, our water glasses were always full and we always had fresh bread and sides.  The buffet portion of the meal was lovely, with lots of fresh salad ingredients, cheeses, and interesting items like asparagus and fresh mozzarella. The cheesey rolls they bring to your table are like crack for your tastebuds--you just can't stop eating them.   Then of course, the main event: The Meat. Waiters come to your table offering whatever they have on their skewers and everything we tried was fabulous from filet mignon to New York strip to lamb and pork ribs. Every bite was heavenly and we ate until we couldn't move.  There's nothing truly unique or fancy, but if you like quality meat, in massive quantities, for one set price, with lots of side dishes, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I gave this restaraunt 5 stars vs the usual excellent 4 star rating I give because we walked into the restaurant with jeans and t-shirts  (everyone else was dressed to kill) and we were greeted with friendly faces. Excellent customer service with fun personalities. Meat served cooked to your liking. Rack of lamb is to die for! Salad bar will leave you wanting for nothing...cold raw salmon was delish! Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"LISTEN CLOSELY FELLOW YELPERS.....  THIS 3 STAR RATING IS SPECIFICALLY FOR MY VISIT FOR LUNCH ON Fri, 9/30. I am originally from Chicago and we have multiple Churrasscos in our area and I frequent Fogo the most and always give them 5 stars but today meats were bland, service was slow and they just didn't seem to have that feel.   In a nutshell: Meats were bland except for Garlic Beef and Bottom Sirloin Salad Bar was great as always Restaurant was clean and appeared relatively new.   I would love to give them a higher rating but I'll leave it for Chicago!"}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant in town! This place is amazing.  The Food is great, the service is great, the salad bar is incredible, and the price is far lower then the quality and quantity of food you actually get.  If you haven't tried this place yet I would definitly suggest it, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fogo in Vegas? Heck yeah, I'm in. There was no way you could keep us away. Stellar service. The manager Jacob made sure we were accommodated to the fullest degree. It was our anniversary weekend and the food did not disappoint one bit.  The absolute best thing about having an anniversary dinner at Fogo is, you get an anniversary desert on the house and that we were seated right in front of the market table. I have noticed that Fogo's interior layout differs from one another, making the inside unique from city to city. Parking here is also easy to slide into.  We chose The Best of Brazil deal for $39 per person. Includes pork, pork ribs, sirloin, top sirloin, leg of lamb, sausage and chicken. Meat distributors are very prompt. The market table was good as usual. And our waitress checked on on us more than enough times, as did the manager. We were blessed with a complimentary desert of our choosing from the menu. We picked the molten chocolate cake. DivinExcellence. The perfect topper to our dinner, a rich chocolate cake accompanied by vanilla ice cream scoops.   An anniversary and money well spent at Fogo. Thanks to their staff for making it a memorable and fine experience!"}
{"text":"1 star for service, 4 stars for the food... This is a place we want to love and eat at often but too often the service sucks and it's pretty pricey on top of a long drive for us. Meat is usually very good, today a lot of it was dry and often when you asked for rare you got med well or they would say they would come  back with a more rare cut and didn't.  The big disappointment was the service though. Our drinks were constantly empty we never got the sides that go with the meats either and could never make eye contract with a server to ask! Finally when we were done he magically appeared and after being asked offered to bring them then, after we will full! He then took 15 minutes to bring check and another 15 minutes to bring back the bank card only to find he mixed it up with a different table!   Huge huge disappointment, as much as I want to love this place I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"The only thing bad about this place is the food coma you will be in when you exit.  There is no excuse for not having exactly what you want during an evening at Fogo.   With 14 types of meats and plenty of options on the salad bar, you can have whatever you want.  Bacon wrapped fillet and Lamb chop were the tops - amazing."}
{"text":"Father's Day was super busy so that's why I am giving a 3 instead of a 2. I do understand, first hand, that being busy effects service. We actually had great service from everyone, except our server. At the beginning he was around often but then he never really came back. The main issues were in regards to availability of items. They were out of 2 wines that we ordered and the dessert we ordered. They said the creme brûlée wouldn't be ready for 2 hours and they wouldn't serve it before. We had to ask multiple times to get any lamb at the table, which turned out to be a bit overdone and too gamey. We also had to ask a couple times for the filet, which sadly was the only steak that wasn't good. Flank steak was amazing!! Bacon steak was great, sirloin was great, and pork was good. Luckily another server helped us with anything we needed. Paying our bill was a nightmare. Took 30 minutes. They over charged us and then disappeared forever when we asked for it to be adjusted. The highlight of the night- a completely separate server, after an hour of being told about the dessert, brought us a creme brûlée. And it was delicious. We did speak to the manager. She didn't seem to care or acknowledge anything. Not that we needed anything free (Father's already got a free meal on the next visit, the problem is that no one wants to go back.) BUT there were no apologies or care. Bummer experience for such a pricey place."}
{"text":"We had great time celebrating my 40th birthday at Fogo de Chão. They allowed us to bring our own birthday cake that they kept in the kitchen until we were ready for it to be served. The staff was awesome and the service was great. We had an awesome time. In all we spent about three hours eating drinking and enjoying our celebration."}
{"text":"Red means stop and Green means go.  If you have never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, this is a good place to go.  Although it's a \"chain restaurant\" and I'm not to big into chains, it is still worth it!  Great meat and very well prepared.  DO NOT load up on the salad.  Save room for the meat.  Get your money's worth from eating meat.  Although the chicken was a bit dry, I loved the garlic steak and lamb."}
{"text":"This is a frustrating review to write. First of all, I have been here a few times, but have yet to review it. I can easily give 5 stars to the food- excellent in every way, the meat is fantastic (although not as good as the Fogo's in Brazil!), and the salad bar is incredible as well. Where it failed my last time was in the service. I made reservations and we were seated promptly, but it took 20 minutes before anybody even came to our table. He took our drink orders and I told him I wanted to order wine, by the time he came back to our table to even take the wine order, we were all already eating, and by the time we were brought our first bottle of wine, we were nearly done with dinner.   Again, the food is awesome, but the service (on every occasion I have been here) was severely lacking..."}
{"text":"Years ago, when I lived in Washington, DC, I ate at a Fogo de Chao there, and for many years, I have been a frequent customer of their competitor Texas de Brazil. I have been to Brazilian steakhouses dozens and dozens and dozens of times. I have to say that I enjoyed this restaurant's salad bar, all of the numerous meats (so many that I could not keep track of what I had already eaten!), our drinks, and our desserts (creme brulee and molten chocolate cake, because their tres leches was not available). All of the food was very delicious! I did have to ask for the beef ribs and bread twice. Unfortunately, the bread was brought out after we had already finished eating dinner, and another server took the bread away a minute later without us getting to eat it.  ***June 2018 update: Since my first review, I have eaten at this restaurant a few more times. During the most recent visit, I had told the restaurant in advance that it was my husband's birthday, and I told them again when a waitress asked us if we were celebrating anything special. Unfortunately, no employee wished him happy birthday. I felt disappointed also that a coupon that had an expiration date in a few days said elsewhere in the coupon that it had already expired."}
{"text":"I came to Fogo during Restaurant Week 2013. After trying to make a reservation the first weekend of restaurant week, I was denied because they were already booked. Since this was going to be one of my birthday meals, hubby said to call back and ask for something towards the end of the week so he could take the day off for it. I called back asked about Friday, August 30th (last day of restaurant week) and the woman on the phone said 2 pm was available so I reserved the spot. When we arrived on the 30th the parking lot seemed dead. For a place that was booked the weekend before, why did it seem nobody was here? I soon got my answer on the front door. They stop serving lunch at 2 pm and pick dinner back up at 5 pm. Fogo called as well e-mailed me conforming the reservation, so I was baffled.   Entering Fogo we were greeted and taken to our table. We sat for a few minutes and then our drink order was taken. I then headed to the salad bar where I was surprised at how some stuff looked very fresh and other stuff looked like it had been sitting there untouched for a while. There was food scattered about along the salad bar and the ranch dressing had a ladle from another dressing inside of it and the ranch ladle was just laying on the counter. I avoided having ranch (my fav) on my salad because there was just too much of a mixture of who knows what inside of it. I went with a few things that looked fresh like tomato, mozzarella, croutons, parmesan and the basil dressing I put on it was delicious.   I wasn't able to have anymore salad, but will explain about that later. So, the meats started coming. The servers were nice, but I don't know if they understood us or what. I told them what type of meat I would like and they would bring something else. They asked how I liked my filet and I said closer to well-done and I get brought a piece of raw red meat. The meat was seriously hit or miss. Some pieces were either very flavorful and tender while others were too raw or nothing but grizzle. The best thing here isn't the beef, but the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken. They do cook those 2 things right and the bacon wrapped chicken might just be the best I have ever eaten. Included with the meal were sides. The 'Mashed Potatoes\" were just average. The \"Cheese Bread\" was dry and disgusting. The cheese bread tasted like a old biscuit. The \"Carmalized Bananas\" were actually very good, but the \"Crispy Polenta\" wasn't for me. I don't know if this experience was due to the time of our reservation or not. I wouldn't have even picked the time if it weren't suggested to me by Fogo.   Then dessert came. Fogo claims the \"Papaya Cream\" is their most requested dessert. Most requested by who?? Sure it looks pretty upon presentation, but this dessert had zero flavor. I could have opened a jar of baby food (the dessert was that consistency) and tasted more flavor. Everyone at my table left their dessert unfinished.   Too bad I didn't try more from the salad bar before we got cut off. The server came to our table and said that the salad bar was going to be closing so the employees could eat. WTH?!?!?!?!?!?!? The RW menu price was $30.13 and included an all you can eat salad bar, endless meats and a dessert. By this time we had only been seated maybe 20 minutes and were the only customers. I felt like we were the ones intruding on the employees eating since it was several of them at the salad bar and sitting at the tables near us. I first must that I think it is a great perk that the employees get to eat a free meal. They work hard and if the food is going to waste anyway then why not let them enjoy it too. I just don't understand why paying customers get cut off so they can have that perk. Dinner didn't start until 5 pm and it wasn't even 2:30 so these employees could have let us enjoy our meal and then stuff their faces. I contacted Fogo about this and got a call back from Whitney, who said they do let the employees eat, but they should have waited until we were finished. Whitney never once said she was sorry on behalf of Fogo and never returned the promised phone call the following day. Just because the small salad I was allowed to eat tasted good and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for, doesn't mean everything else was acceptable. I would much rather give my money to Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"So I have been to many locations and this leaves something to be desired. Service was seen but not heard from. Meat was over cooked despite them asking our preference. Potatoes were cold and sent back and didnt get new till dessert was ordered.  Salad bar was well stocked and that part was good. Parking needs work - no valet option. It's a new location that needs to work out the kinks! Will try one more time in a few months with the hopes of improvement knowing that good locations do exist and have loved them in the past!"}
{"text":"This was my first time experiencing Brazilian steakhouse! Service was above exceptional! Christopher was awesome and knowledgeable. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great salad bar and great meat!  Much better than Texas. Service is amazing as well. Couldn't be happier!  My fav was the lamb and the bottom sirloin!"}
{"text":"Meat Heaven.  This place is phenomenal.  A good spot for special occasions.  This is definitely a restaurant to be enjoyed in moderation.  Quarterly is my limit.  I always need about three months to recover from the meat coma.    The salad bar is perfect for anyone in your party that doesn't want meat.  The service is always fantastic and you never have to wait for one individual to get back to you.  Servers and Gauchos are always attentive."}
{"text":"This is a meat lover's paradise. A Brazilian Steakhouse is not for the light hearted. Fogo de Chao exceeded my expectations in all areas.  I honestly can't remember all the types of meats I tried because I liked them all! My favorites were the House Sirloin and Top Sirloin. It was marinated perfectly and tasted great with the Chimichurri sauce. I like my meat medium cooked and all of the meat was cooked to my liking. My absolute favorite part about my meal were the cheese puffs. They were little puffs of heaven! I must have eaten about 20 of them!  The only reason I gave it four stars is because I enjoy the salad bar offerings at Texas de Brazil more. Don't get me wrong, they had a variety of salad items such as fresh cut salmon, cheeses, prosciutto and roasted potatoes.. but there is something about Texas de Brazil's Lobster Bisque that I crave.  Service was exceptional. We had a large party of eight adults and two babies. I like that they had high chairs and car seat slings. They were quick to refill our drinks and replenish our cheese puffs and sides. Best of all, they kept the meat coming!  This is a good place to go for large parties. They have long tables and private rooms. Just try not to go to the salad bar the same time as a party of 20.   I would definitely recommend Fogo to my meat loving friends."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that there was another Brazilian Steakhouse option on my side of town, so made reservations for the family for dinner. Service was fairly good, although our original server disappeared about half way through dinner, and we finally had to grab a random server to take his place. The salad bar had a lot of options, and was kept full while we were there. Raw asparagus seemed like an odd thing to put out, but everything else was ok. Not great, just ok.   Our cheese bread was  cold when it came out (3 pieces the first time, two the second). When they started bringing the meat around, I was really disappointed by the first four cuts we had. The meat was very tough. They redeemed themselves a bit with the pork loin, chicken and sausages, which were all tasty and well cooked.  They bring out 3 sides (potatoes, fried bananas and fried polenta dusted with cheese).   After tip and cocktails, we ended up spending around $270 for a party of three. For the price, I am probably going to stick with Via Brazil. I found the cuts of meat to be much better and the variety of sides and salad bar a bit nicer."}
{"text":"Nothing good to say about this experience, service is ridiculous slow, half the meat wasn't cooked & we sat near the window which apparently is not on the main runway for service    we had several times for the food to come to us, small place and 3/4 full but so damn slow    doesn't compare in the least bit to Texas de Brazil"}
{"text":"I took 10 guests out for dinner and I thought this would be a fun place to check out. We had done Texas de Brazil before and wanted to mix it up. I can't say how disappointing our experience was.  We arrived just after 7 and met 2 friends in the bar. Our dinner reservation was for 7:30. Our friends had drinks and the bartender told us he would be with us in just a minute. He was busy tending to the other couple at the bar. 20 minutes later we were a party of 8 and we still hadn't gotten a drink order in. When the server said our table was ready I said we we would take it as we couldn't order drinks at the bar. I was hoping she would take the hint and get a server right over to take our drink order.   So 8pm hits and we have been sitting at the table for a half hour. We finally have someone approach and take our drinks. After 3 people he says thats all he can remember and he will have to come back for the other drinks. I'm frustrated. I ask him to write down everyones order so we don't have to wait another hour. We get our drinks and now it's just getting comical. The wrong bottles of wine are brought out. The Vodka Diets are brought in two cups. One Vodka and one diet coke. I guess it's mix your own drink night.  Our group is pretty easy going so we are just gong with things at this point. close to 8:30 I finally ask a lady walking by if she or anyone could take our order.   Some of our group only eat fish and I looked online and noticed they had a menu you could order so meals off of. Our server wasn't aware of any menu. She walked around confused then pointed out the back of the drink menu and pointed out a shrimp option. Then she said they had a fish sea bass but it was big so we wouldn't want that. Ok then... We all went standard dinner.  Everyone was nice so the service was more comical than upsetting. We were hoping that the food would make up for things. It did not.  The Salad bar had 20% of the items missing and nothing got refreshed thru out the night. The sides they brought us were cold and we got two small plates of everything for our whole table to share.  We would go on to order drinks that never showed up. The same server took one of the wives order three times and not once did her drink come.  Our favorite thing was we noticed that after the first round of food we stoped getting served. Our friend at the end of the table went Red with his card. As soon as he went green again the table got served. Back to Red.... No food for anyone.   The food was mediocre. Some of the cuts were tasty but nothing really stood out. The whole group mentioned that Texas De Brazil blows them away.  At the end of the day nobody got sick so they were the big loser. Had they been taking drink orders I'm sure our bill would have been $500 more for the evening.   Service 2/10 ( I only give it 2 because it was so bad it was entertaining) Food 5/10 ( The Salad Bar was destroyed/sides were cold and not enough for the table/ food was ok when they did bring it around which was few and far between)  I bought the holiday gift cards so I got another $150 to use the next few months. I don't think it's worth going back. Maybe the Flaming location is better but is it worth another bad night out? I don't know if I want to risk it."}
{"text":"Loved the experience! Went there for my graduation and everything went great!! I loved the way I was treated and the complementary dessert, Thank you!!! Will be returning pretty soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great Price and Good Food!  I think the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of the customer service that they provide.  All the staff members work together as a team and it made the experience wonderful. You need a new clean plate? Their on it! You want something you havn't see come out yet? No problem they'll go get it. Another cocktail? well they have someone coming around with a mobile cart to bring you one! I was 100% satisfied with the customer service end.  The food was pretty good. Now don't get me wrong it was delicious. However I am comparing it to another Brazilian steakhouse I've been to in San Francisco and for around the same price their food is EXCELLENT. Now the customer service on the other hand is not as good. I wasn't overly impressed with the salad bar,  I would probably skip it next time I go and just focus on stuffing my face with more meat!  Bottom line: Great food and exceptional customer service. I would come here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the greatest lunches I have ever had.  The food is fantastic, the salad bar is amazing, and the meat, oh the choices of meat.  If i had the money I would go every other day, the price point is way over my head.  A great place to take a date, or a good friend and enjoy oneself.  It is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is just simply superb, the service is excellent and the meat service is just the best, I've Ben to so many restaurants and this so far is the very best I've had...I recommend this place to all my friends visiting and living in Las Vegas to come here and have a well deserved meal with excellent service. Thank you for accommodating our party of 12."}
{"text":"I was here for a friend's wedding reception, and I arrived early to help set up. The room that we got was nice, and I found the staff to be very helpful. Someone brought a last minute guest book, so we didn't have a table to get it set up, but the staff there was really fast to get us a table.   All this great service... why three stars? We had reservations at 7.  We didn't get to eat until after 8. The bride even asked when we could start eating. And when we finally got the meat served to us, everything was medium to well done. Everyone at my end of the table asked for medium rare, which we had to pass on a lot because it was too cooked. The salad bar was nice. We only had four sides: cheese bread, mashed potatoes, fried bananas and polenta fries. For the price that was paid, I would have expected better meat."}
{"text":"Yes it is very fancy. You get a dining experience like no other because of people coming by to serve you meats you request, etc. the servers have to be very professional so yes you get that. But the salad bar wasn't anything special (this is the first thing you go through before actual food experience). When they bring us the meat, some are extremely amazing and some are just okay nothing special which is why I give this 4 stars. The service, the place, and some meats are amazing but it's overrated.   +++Oh but for dessert PLEASE get their creme brûlée because wow it's good for two people and it is one of the best creme brûlée's I've tasted.(so there's that!) :)"}
{"text":"Jose, Claire, and the whole team really love what they do and it shows.  The best Brazilian Steakhouse experience I've had hands down.  Thanks for a very memorable evening!"}
{"text":"We went here Saturday night for dinner, it was very awful service and food.   The meat was disgusting, either too dry or too rare... Our server was wiping his forehead with tons of sweat everywhere. The veggies were practically frozen.   It was nasty, I would never recommend this place! I wish it would have been better for the price we paid!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Okay, I'm not a huge meat eater so I'll say more about the salad bar. Yummy! Very fresh and lots of variety. If you are a meat eater careful not to fill up on the salad bar. I did notice there were cuts of meat you had to ask for. Make sure you ask for the fillet mignon otherwise you might not get it or it comes out last and by then you are full! I thought the rib eye was the best out of all the meats. Don't like pork so we didn't try that. My son and husband loved this place but they are meat lovers."}
{"text":"We read Yelp reviews saying don't eat much from the salad bar, but didn't listen! Was too full 1/2 through to try all the meat. It's good stuff though. I suggest you not take the first slice of meat off a new steak unless you like a ton of salt. Our favs were the caramelized bananas and red potatoes from the salad bar."}
{"text":"I love the concept, it's not your average restaurant. Excellent food and I love the wide array of options,"}
{"text":"Filet, Sirloin, and Ribeye, oh my!  This was my first Fogo De Chao experience, and it exceeded my expectations!  I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses in the past, but Fogo was fabulous!  Sure, I could've made a meal on the sensational thirty item salad bar on it's own, but I took a breather and then went for the meat.  Green light on!  I also enjoyed the crispy hot polenta and caramelized banana side dishes. Yum!  Rolando was the waiter I had the most contact with and he was remarkable.  Evan, the GM, was friendly as well... this was such a treat to be a part of, and of course, even more fun because I was surrounded by some of my favorite yelpers!  Thanks Fogo folks - once I digest my 2 - 3 lbs of meat, I'll be back to see you again!"}
{"text":"Very limited selection on the salad bar. There's no live entertainment like other Brazilian churrasco place I've been to. For the price you pay..this place is not worth it."}
{"text":"100% worth every penny! Just took my large family (11 people) for a birthday lunch. The service was astronomical and the food was delicious!! This was our second visit and we went 40 minutes past a similar restaurant to eat at Fogo! Highly recommended and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Dude....  F*×king BACON is like crack candy!  Git ur a** here! My first time here, but so not the last! It's close enough to the strip to walk off the calories and easy to get to from the east.  Next to Paradise!"}
{"text":"I love Brazilian bbq! All the different types of meats are delicious and perfectly cooked.   I liked their salad bar that had different fruits, cured meats, cheeses, and veggies.   My favorite meat was probably the garlic steak it was super juicy and had a decent amount of fat on each piece. I also really liked their heart shaped meat I think it was the top sirloin (?). Their lamb was also good and not super over powering. The rack of lamb was also pretty good, but I'm not a lamb person. I forgot the cut of meat it was but one was on the rare side which was really delicious! The meat is really salty because later on that night I couldn't stop drinking water, but needless to say it was a really great meal!   I paired the meat with a nice merlot. They didn't have the one I wanted but they brought out a different one similar to it.   I liked the ambiance of this place. It's dim and very intimate. One of my friends picked up the check, but I'm guessing it was around 50+ a person."}
{"text":"5 stars for food preparation, and ambiance. 3 stars for service: good/average overall, not stellar: no personal touches, no menu recommendations, and there was at least one bread basket that was dumped on the table with a thud. We had a very nice time and I will go back. I normally don't bother writing a 3 star review, but, at the end of the meal, our server asked how everything was, then, after we said \"it was great,\" he introduced himself for the first time, and asked for a review. When we gave a \"maybe\" type response, he repeatedly asked, and said that sometimes people say they will and then never do, pressuring for a promise we would, making the 'yelp ask' the last impression of the meal, and, the most time he had taken talking to us during the meal. I'm not mentioning his name (he wrote it down) because I want to express my displeasure  without getting anyone in trouble, as he was acting like these reviews had a major impact on his life at this restaurant. Maybe management chose to dole out bonuses based on yelps, and it sucks for the customer.  You can ask, but don't make it weird. -- and I should already have heard your name and feel special if you hope for a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Everything I have to say about Fogo de Chao, in Scottsdale is 100% amazing! I have been to 4 different Fogo chains. This one is by far the best. The service, impeccable. The food, perfect and consistent. The price... Who cares?!?!!  I have been to this location close to 20 times and every time, Pure Gold!!!"}
{"text":"Always top notch and fun. The food is outstanding and the staff friendly. The main reason to come here is to eat! The meats are excellent and keep coming. Salad bar is good, but the meat is the draw. Definitely a fun night out for a group of carnivores. The flan for desert is worth keeping some room for."}
{"text":"If you're a carnivore this is the place for YOU! :D Meat Heaven. For $49.50 you have access to unlimited salad bar and 16 different cuts of meat. Drinks are separate. Waiters come up to your table with chicken, lamb, flank steak, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, ribs etc. Try not to get full from the salad bar though. It's great for a birthday dinner, anniversary, date or just because. You're guaranteed to leave full and satisfied! :) Great service!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. Excellent friendly staff. Management is active and friendly in the dining area and the food is delicious. They also support local charities and the community as a whole. Love this place.  Be prepared for a meat coma and come hungry."}
{"text":"Went to Fogo de Chao with some family from out of town and they wanted to try a Brazilian Steakhouse. Located off of Flamingo it was easy to find but parking was a challenge. They have a parking lot with a large majority of spots reserved for valet parking. it's just a few footsteps away from the entrance so not sure why so many valet spots are need but I parked in a lot next to this business. This was my only issue of the evening and the food made up for it. Everyone had the Full Churrasco experience which includes the endless meats and the market table. The market table had a variable of selections including: salads, fruits, cured meats and cheeses, roasted peppers, bacon, mushrooms. These were just a few of my choices but there were many more to choose from. You can definitely fill up on the market table but I had a taste of each to save room for the meat selection. Several different pieces of beef, chicken, parmesan crusted pork loin, lamb chops and leg of lamb  and of coarse the house special, the picanha. The picanha was by fare the best I tried, the best example of melt in your mouth meat it did not disappoint.  Service was excellent. Plenty of Gaucho's walking around slicing the meat at your table and staff walking by making sure the experience was what you would expect. They asked if we tried everything and went out of their way to find the meats we didn't see at the table. An excellent place to dine for locals and perfect place to take guests when visiting."}
{"text":"Every time my sister and brother in law are in town we have to come here - it's tradition. We love it. I absolutely love that you get to order your meat how you want it - rare to well done. My nephews can't get enough of the cheese puffed rolls that come out, and who can blame them?! This is the only place I will eat lamb, every cut of meat is perfectly prepared and served. They do it right here and have excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I like a good piece of meat every once in a while, but man this place is MEAT OVERLOAD!!! The Gauchos that work here are really Brazilians from Brazil that cook and serve you generous portions of the 15 types of meat here. a bunch of us decided to take advantage of the Yelp Spring Break offer and dine in for $37.  There are many great items available at their salad bar, but you want to be very careful and not fill up on these items, because the meats and sides are where its at. my favorite meats were the Bone-in Lamb Chop and the Pichana. The sides(Potatoes, Polenta, and Plantains) were a perfect compliment to the well seasoned meats, and the Cheese Bread? Totally addicting!  The color cards....you're gonna have to play \"Red Light, Green Light\" with these Gauchos because if you just leave it green side up, they will bombard you with their meat rods like teeny-bopper girls trying to get Justin Bieber's autograph! Just Sayin'.......ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(271/365) \" A Carniwhore's Heaven!\""}
{"text":"The BEST Brazilian place I have ever eaten at! The salad bar was amazing and the meat was so tender and mouth watering!! The service was AMAZING! Never once did we have to ask for anything......it was there before we even thought to ask! I will def be coming here again next time I am in Vegas!! If I could I would give it 10 stars!"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday dinner the very last time we were in Las Vegas. We have been wanting to eat at Fogo for years - having gone to various Churrascaria's - such as Pampas and Texas de Brazil and the old one in Mirage when in Vegas; as well as various smaller ones throughout the country when we travel. But Fogo is the holy grail of Churrascaria's. Overall no major complaints - the restaurant is located off strip - not too far, but I would recommend taking an Uber or Lyft if you are staying on Strip and don't have a car. We stayed at Linq and it was a less than $10 Lyft returning home - it was still light out and we did walk there to build up an appetite - about 1 mile from the Linq.   We did make a reservation for a Thursday night but there was no need, the restaurant was far from packed and that being said, the service was pretty slow. We had to ask twice for our check, multiple times for water, etc... Whatever though - it is what it is. We did have a coupon since it was my birthday so I believe it was a buy 1 dinner get 1 dinner free - which was a steal! We were out the door with tip for like $75 (I believe it's $50 for dinner).   The review for the food - absolutely superb! I wouldn't necessarily say it's better than any of the other Churrascaria's we've been to - but we were not disappointed. The variety was wonderful and fresh and they were very attentive with bringing over meats that we wanted repeats of or had not yet seen. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is partially due to service, and partially due to the fact that they don't do pineapple! I would say EVERY Churrascaria we have ever been to includes grilled pineapple - not only to cleanse the palette but also as a dessert as it's usually grilled with cinnamon sugar, so that was the only main disappointment.   The side dishes - cheesy bread bites, mashed potatoes, rice, and grilled bananas were very good - no complaints here as well :) Will we be back? Meh - maybe, maybe not - with Pampas and the great groupons and coupons they have and their location on strip - we'd probably do that instead of going to Fogo - but that doesn't mean we'd rule it out in another city to try it out :)"}
{"text":"Meat, meat, meat and more meat.... this place is the mecca of meat, probably the best cuts of meat anywhere.    There is lamb, garlic chicken, parmesan chicken, bbq chicken legs, sirlon steak, rib eye steak, every kind of sausage you can imagine.   OMG.... if your a meat lover you'll be in meat heaven but I must say the salad bar was by far one of the best I've had.    Considering it's a buffet style salad bar, it was still amazing.    You had a choice of soup to whole roasted garlic. The best  part of Fogo are the waiters who walk around with huge metal skewers. Watching them slice the meat is magical.    If your looking for seafood here they have it too but this place is strictly for the meat lovers!"}
{"text":"For our first time we thought it wasn't bad. I've been a fan of Texas Dr Brazil since they opened. For my husband's birthday he wanted to give this place a try.  He liked the filet here but the lamb chops and leg of lamb are 5 stars at TDB.   All around I prefer TDB for the salad bar, rice/beans, sauteed mushrooms and the heavenly lobster bisque and the larger variety of meats. The meats offered at FDC were a good variety but noticed they had 3 different top sirloin selections. The black beans at FDC were mealy and needed to be cooked longer. The side dishes of mashed potatoes, crispy polenta, bananas were good. Our guest really enjoyed the cheese rolls. The service was attentive. They seated our 5 top in a dining area mostly occupied by large parties of 6-12 people. It got so noisy we couldn't have a conversation across the table. My tip if you are a party of 4 or less request the main dining room near the salad bar."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the coolest restaurants around. My favorite thing about this place is everyone dresses up to dine in a fine dining restaurant. As they reach the entrance they walk into a  beautiful white table cloth restaurant to eat Brazilian BBQ, all you can eat bbq. Its a pretty cool site to see the the cooks flying around the room with large pieces of meat on a skewer"}
{"text":"Fogo de chao was a great expierence. Great people and great meat! If u want a great waiter ask for junior hes the man!!"}
{"text":"I love,love,love this place!!! Not one bad word and service is amazing and staff is super courteous.  Come with an appetite for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Went there for their lunch - what a great deal and an awesome meal!  Salad bar was awesome - the Parmasean wheel, palm heart and a ton of fresh fruits & Vegetable Choices.  The side dishes - plantain awesome, mashers above average, rice so-so but the cheese bread was to die for!  about 15 choices of BBQ protein circulating throughout the store.  Service was on-point and the price for lunch was a steal (even in Vegas)!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my husband's birthday through their website, but when I called to ask if we can come 10 minutes later, they said they had no record of my reservation. It wasn't a problem to walk in however. They are fairly new at this location, so maybe they're still working out some kinks.   Before going into detail, let me say that the my meal was tasty and my husband enjoyed his steak. My daughter loved it, as she never experienced this type of restaurant before, and we allowed her to order desert for my husband's birthday. My fish portion was on the smaller side, especially considering it was $42. The salad bar was just ok. The soup was great, but I did get sick before even leaving the restaurant. Sorry TMI, but i'm keeping it real...maybe there was a cream or something my stomach couldn't handle in the soup. It tasted good going down as did the fish, but again, my tummy was not happy. The bathroom was really nice, thank god. Very clean and well kept. To be fair, I eat clean and typically don't eat rich foods. My husband said the meat was good.   My husband got the full experience since he's more of a steak eater than I am, and I opted for the Sea bass only. Based on the website, I thought I was getting shrimp cocktail included but that's extra. My 6 year old was free, so that was a bonus. However, some of the servers did not offer her any meat. My husband shared his. Maybe that's what they mean by \"free.\" I thought they'd be serving her. I did ask one of the servers to share the lamb chops with her, since that is her favorite. He obliged, but I had to ask. It worked out ok since my husband allowed her to taste other items, but I thought they might offer to place meat on her plate. I'm sure she's a better eater than most 6 year olds, so perhaps they didn't think she wanted any.??   The manager was nice enough to tell me to try some meat if I would like, as i'm sure he noticed I scarfed down my fish much faster than my husband could finish his experience. I declined as I was full, but i thought it was a nice gesture. They were still handling only about 2 other tables, so I sure hope they don't have to waste all the meat that is leftover when the restaurant is so empty. Perhaps that's why he encouraged I try some.   On a Tuesday night last week, it was fairly empty. We arrived around 5:30 and there was one other table but they left shortly after. Two other tables were seated towards the end of our meal, So there really wasn't much of an atmosphere other than the servers who were all within sight and seemed very friendly.   I was hoping to love it, so we could go back for Easter but I think I'd prefer a full sit down meal. The service was very good and food was fine, I just wasn't blown away. I've been to this style steak house before so I knew what to expect, but I thought I'd be more impressed with the salad bar and fish. Again it's a steak joint, so maybe I shouldn't review them for the fish but this is really a review for the overall experience and I did get full feedback from my husband on the steak and how it faired against other steak house. I might try it again if my husband requested it, but I don't think it's a place I'd crave."}
{"text":"Awesome workers awesome food.  Found out that there workers some of them where new and I had no clue!!!  Shout-out to those who served!"}
{"text":"I have been to several of these located in various major cities in the US and my experience has been the same for all of them: worth every penny!  Come hungry and be prepared to leave fighting for your next breath (because you are full, duh)  Word of advice, be judicious with your choices at the salad bar, or you my not be able to savor each cut of meat that comes around.  For some reason, that elusive filet mignon seems to arrive when you've nearly had enough.  The salad bar is stuffed full of things that are not salad (of course it has various salads and dressings too).  Smoked salmon, Spanish Manchego cheese, and various fruits to name a few.  Another thing, also do not scarf down the rolls they bring to the table the first thing you do when you sit down...they are so good you'll keep eating them.  Lastly, just forget counting calories or trying to be healthy... accept the fact that this dinner is a treat and you'll work out some other time."}
{"text":"From the first greeting through walking out the door, we had top notch service!!  The food was well above the \"other\" Brazilian places, outstanding quality.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"both food and service were excellent. The buffet was beautifully presented with an array of side dishes, charcuterie, and salads while the meats arrive at your table.  it is a fun and delicious way to dine particularly for our paleo friends!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Meat. Came here for a date night and tried all the wonderful meats. Everything was delicious and so flavorful. The mashed potatoes were a highlight of the meal and went great with everything we tasted. From Kevin to Dani, everyone we interacted with was so nice and we could come back in a heartbeat if not just for the service."}
{"text":"I only went because I had a gift certificate. The restaurant was so bright that I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria. Service was good. Food was ok. Drinks were outrageous. $17 for a cocktail? Where are we, Vegas? Basically, I felt like I was at a theme park restaurant on the Vegas strip. Won't ever be going back."}
{"text":"Minh, Caroline, and the entire team provided exceptional service for myself and our entire party. The food, as to be expected, was phenomenal... But the service of the entire wait staff is the true winner of this restaurant. Thank you for another perfect experience."}
{"text":"Found another place gor our family nights out. My boys were very opened minded and tried all the meats. Everything was delicious. Diffiently going to be returning back for another visit."}
{"text":"I was kind of bummed that Texas de Brazil was booked for Father's Day but the food and the staff at Fogo made me forget all about it. Food was amazing and our server Samson is one of the best I have run in to. Samson made my Father's Day with my boys a great experience. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Food: Average. Crispy Palenta and Fried Plantains were good. Mango Sea Bass lacked flavor, even with the mango sauce. Pineapple mint lemonade was delicious.  Service: Excellent. Everyone was attentive and extremely nice.  Overall: Good. If you're downtown and feeling upscale, not a bad option but not a destination."}
{"text":"For $100 I think I'd rather go to Mastro's or another steakhouse.  Service here was excellent and you definitely get a wide variety of meat options, but I only found two out of the 6+ choices tasty. The lamb leg and the bacon wrapped filet were delicious but the sausages, pork, chicken, pork/beef ribs and even filet mignon were unimpressive.  The salad bar a $22.50 upcharge wasn't exactly worth the price. Nothing stood out, and there wasn't anything amazing that I went back for seconds for.  Sides were complimentary, which included fried polenta, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas. They were pretty good, but don't compare to the lobster mash or truffle mac and cheese as Mastro's.  The ambience is definitely nice and upscale without being stuffy. Plenty of kids running around and guys with backwards facing hats on. This was my first legitimate Brazilian steakhouse experience and I think it will be my last. If  you're looking for variety go to KBBQ and you'll also leave feeling overstuffed, satisfied, and still have an extra $50 in your wallet."}
{"text":"Ohhhh the bread, that's to die for. Obviously you have to go there when you are hungry and you are meat eater (though salad bar is extensive and very fresh).   Service was great, waiters don't always speak good English but this is Vegas.   I do wish the front reception would remain in place longer, we wanted a cab but there was no one at front or bar section and had to take a limo instead."}
{"text":"I saw great comments regarding this place. All those have posted regarding this place I have prop you were correct. This place is great food was just so good it's hard to put it in words. If look meat and aren't happy with on servicing than this place is for you guys.   At long has your tap card next to you say green they will keep bring great juicy meat. When you thing you had all you can turn that card upside down to red.  Ok ladies sorry i forgot about you the salad bar is great everything is great from the green plants to protein cooked.    The sweet tooth people the dessert is great. We had the cheese cake and it was so good that we finish pulse order anther piece."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff. The people there really make you feel welcomed. I'd go again definitely! My mom and aunt are vegetarian but loved the salad bar too."}
{"text":"If I could give them 10 STARS I would.  This Fogo de Chao in Scottsdale, Arizona is the bomb.com!!!! The food is great the wait staff even better. Our night here was a Birthday surprise for my husband.  He really enjoyed himself.  Can't wait for my Birthday!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great ambience. The variety and quality is stunning! Loved the whole evening. Service by Samson was outstanding."}
{"text":"The food and service are top notch. Great experience. Great atmosphere as well. Highly recommend. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant had awesome service from beginning to end.  The meats were all easily available, and if they weren't multiple people checked on the status.  I would highly recommend this place. Just be prepared to drop some cash."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.  DISLIKE  First server was not as welcoming as the others (which may have been due to a language barrier).  LIKE  The shrimp and mango salad. The salad bar. The cheese bread, plantains, and polenta cake sides. The papaya cream dessert. The team of servers. The ambiance.  LOVE  The different cuts of meat especially the house special, the bacon wrapped chicken breast, and the flank."}
{"text":"I really liked Fogo,  and it was a great spot for a large group.   The only reason I didn't give this a four star was because the \"non meat\" sides were okay. And I get it!... This is a brazillian steakhouse, the effort is in the meat, but it would have been cool to have more knock out sides brought to the table when the meat was served, just to get somewhat of a balance diet... I'm personally not a huge fan of herding like cattle to the salad bar, with the sneeze guards etc. and no I'm not looking for spinach on a skewer brought to the table ..........  Overall the restaurant staff were good, and if I could give 3.75 stars I would have done that. Thanks!"}
{"text":"First time going to Fogo and it won't be the last! This place had such great service from the beginning. We were greeted and seated right away. Jose was the supervisor and was our server for most of our dinner. There was another server but Jose stood out the most because he was checking to make sure we were doing ok. Now to the best part the food, they have a really good salad bar and extras like rice, beans, potato salad, chicken salad and more. They also start you off with bread and they bring you sides like garlic mashed potatoes. Be prepared to eat until u can't breath haha. Once the meat starts coming around they have so many delicious choices. My experience at fogo was great and I thank Jose for being so great to us and everyone at fogo! I need some time to recover from all that food and I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!  Best quality and amazing presentation.  Stays true to the Brazilian style of serving and recipes....  Their specialty drink is soooo good too, the infamous national cocktail is the real deal too....  CAIPIRINHA"}
{"text":"I went here with a very dear friend when we visited Las Vegas. This is the perfect classy, same price as a buffet, not packed but full and lively place we were looking for! Couples always welcome and meat-loving friends to boot!  1. Don't enjoy the salad bar very much until you have seen the amount of meat that will end up on your plate. 2. Feel free to request only \"medium well\" or \"well done\" meat, or whatever your preference, sometimes they will make it just for you and bring it out only for you!  3. Take advantage of the picture taking cheesiness -- it's the only place that gave me a quality picture for a decent price of some of the best memories in Vegas!   P.S. Brazillians love blondes, and I enjoyed the extra attntion!"}
{"text":"Great $40 summertime deal going on right now. Food was flavorful. The service was great! Minh and Tevin especially went out of their ways to take extra care of us. Over all the experience was phenomenal! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week Rip Off...  E-mail to: Fogo de Chao.....What a JOKE!!!! I've eaten at your restaurant many times and when I got this months e-mail regarding Arizona Restaurant Week, I thought this was great and what a deal. $40.00 vs.$49.00 plus free dessert. WOW was I mislead;  to find, A Limited meat selection and the dessert was a tiny sliver. One of the main reasons I enjoy your restaurant is the lamb chops and filet both plus others not available. So I choose to pay the full price $49.00, so I could enjoy the things I go to Fogo de Chao for. Then I was told \"but we will still include the free dessert\" they failed to tell me it was just a tiny sliver and not your normal full portions.  If you want to run a special with reduced selections and portions that is fine JUST SAY SO IN YOUR ADS. Don't wait for me to come in to find out. That just pisses me off and makes me wonder if I'll ever come back. Buyer Beware of Misleading Ads."}
{"text":"Great company dinner at 5-star Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão located in Downtown Summerlin.  Greeter escorted us to a private area where we met Customer Service Rep (host), Minh Nguyen.   Minh and his team explained the purpose of the meat pod for those new to the restaurant style which was helpful. Salad bar was full stocked, don't forget to get plenty of the pepper bacon - delicious! The carvers were pleasant and attentive to each request from medium to well done. Fogo sure knows how to make their VIP feel the Love!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience...meat very tenderand jicy...little dissapointed not as many variety of meat they could serve since i wen on weekda...was all beef n a few chicken n pork..was looking forward fo the ducks quail and other choices..."}
{"text":"The staff is impeccable always hustling always keeping your glasses filled. Having gone to several Fogo de Chao's in other cities this one was among the best. Meats were flavorful and properly cooked, never had to wait more than a few minutes to get my personal favorites"}
{"text":"This place is definitely an experience ! I'm not the biggest meat lover but my husband was in heaven. Probably one of  the best restaurant service I've had!"}
{"text":"best rodizio brasileriro, not even in Brazil I had it this good. Every meat is perfect full of flavor especially my personal favorite, the picanha. Even the buffet, while being not overwhelming has big and juicy veggies, prosciutto and a whole parmigiano reggiano cheese for you to dig! I never once had dessert with rodizio but at Fogo I had to try a dessert that I only had in brazil crema de mamao (spelling not sure) which is papaya blended with ice cream and some brazilan liquor in it, really good. The place was super packed and I can see why meats and service were top notch I will definitely be back soon. It is unfortunate for via brasil (which used to be my fav in town) and texas (not that great anyway) I will never go anywhere else for a brazilian meat feast. There is no comparison for the quality and the taste of the meat, while pretty much you get the same variety everywhere."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and the service was excellent.  The meal is a bit pricey, but was well worth it with the different cuts of meat.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"If you know what you want and you're prepared, Fogo de Chao is 5 stars. Practically starved myself all day so I could indulge. Father-in-law and I were greeted warmly by the hostess. Stopped in the bar for a drink and had a nice glass of wine, server was friendly & helpful. Server explained the concept to my FIL, who had never been to a churrascaria. Salad bar was nice, just icked up a few nibbles (olives, prosciutto, roasted peppers...) to complement the upcoming meatfest.   It's all about knowing what you like.  Best of the meats: the two top sirloin selections are spectacular, as was the lamb chop and lamb t-bone. Juicy & flavorful/ Ribeye was super tasty.   Worst - leg of lamb was overmarinated, the pork ribs were cooked fine but needed some sort of rub/seasoning, the bottom sirloin had great texture but was kind of bland.  Passed on the chicken, sausages and filet mignon.  Service was prompt, attentive and polite without being overbearing.  A great meal, and a fun/different experience."}
{"text":"OH MY LORD.....   I have found the most amazing steakhouse ever!!!!! Actually to be completely honest and the technicalities of the story is my boyfriend found it.  How he found out, I probably will never find out anyways.    Back to Thee Food: MIND BLOWING!!!!!!  This place is so good and so worth $40 a plate.  This place makes me want to tell everyone to go for their Birthday so I have a legitimate reason to go soon.  I cannot wait to go back!! the steak is so good I do not need A1 for any slice they put on my plate.  The one thing I did not necessarily care for was the Parmesan crusted pork chop or the bacon wrapped chicken, they were both a little dry for my taste. I was also too absorbed in my delicious steak that I  was too slow to catch the guys running around with the lamb.  Lamb is pretty easy to mess up so you get that gamey type taste in your mouth if you don't marinade it correctly or don't put enough garlic.  So I was interested to see how they made theirs.  You get unlimited sides as well  and bread or whatever those awesome type rolls were. I did not love the mashed potatoes much because I love my own so much more.  The plantains were my favorite and could eat those all day!  The fried polenta was a little weird but not horrible or great. Just Whatever in my opinion.  A definite must go to if you have not been and love meat! You wont be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"A little pricey , but very tasty ! Our waiter was really good , explained everything well .. The price is the only thing if they have discounts for locals I'm sure plenty more will be dining here more often"}
{"text":"This place was awesome I have eaten at a Texas de Brazil and by comparison this place kills it!  The service was perfect the food was excellent and I highly recommend the Xingu Black Beer.  The only down side was sleeping off the meat coma, but a quick walk on Fremont Street helped a little.  If you want a great meal you have to try it out!"}
{"text":"My second visit to this location. Love the food and the service. Meats are very good and they come out fast. Salad bar has a lot of choices as well as rice and beans."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The salad bar is dangerous, as you can easily go crazy and forget that it's all you can meat afterwards! Very attentive wait staff. They don't miss a beat. The meat is top notch. Pace yourself and eat your favorite meat cuts first, in case you start running out of room towards the end. There is definitely a lot to choose from.  Oh! And don't forget to have a Caipirinha! They're quite refreshing!"}
{"text":"5 Things   1. if you're on a high protein diet - Go Here!~ 2. No prices - rule of thumb.. if you have to ask - you can't afford it. No joke this place for 2 people is an easy $200 3. It's fun.. almost like a game. You have a card which you flip over when you want them to bring you more meat and back over when you don't. 4. Go here if you're starving otherwise you're not going to eat your money's worth. 5. Caipirinha - Don't be fooled it is no mojito.. it will knock you on your ass it's painfully strong..but you can power through it, It's not very sweet, it's actually kinda awful.lol"}
{"text":"I love everything about Fogo de Chao! An evening at a Brazilian steakhouse is an event. The atmosphere is relaxed, the decor is luxe, and the service is superb. Every part of the restaurant staff seems dedicated to your enjoyment.  Now for the food. I would come here for the salad bar and side dishes alone. Fresh, crisp greens; garden vegetables beautifully presented, an ever changing selection of cheeses and deli meats, olives. I could go on! The garlic mashed potatoes, fried bananas and polenta are delicious and served in the perfect amount.   What can I say about the meat? Cuts of beef familiar and novel, pork roast, lamb chops, pork and beef ribs all expertly cooked on swords around an open flame. Chicken and sausages roasted to perfection. I loved the top and bottom sirloin and the filet. I always have at least a piece of chicken and a sausage. I was too stuffed to try the lamb or beef ribs.  The dessert was just right. We had the flan, the creme brûlée and the chocolate mousse cake.   Finally, the cocktails were perfect. I will always go to a Fogo de Chao when I can. If you've never been there, you owe to to yourself."}
{"text":"I love this place! You know when its good when even Brazilians go to this place to eat. If you are a big meat lover, this is your spot. Its pricey but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome best way to celebrate my birthday impeccable service by my servers Derek Lucas,Thomas and Andy. Management Marco and Lou are amazing.....that just to start....before I even ate....loved the salad bar...and the garlic beef is to die for"}
{"text":"All I can say is come with an appetite.  The food is absolutely delicious. The premise is beyond all you can eat.  It's all you can eat MEAT! Top sirloin, Filet Mignon, Lamb Chops, Pork Loin, Bacon Wrapped Chicken Breast, and on and on. The Salad bar is not your ordinary Salad Bar. No canned Corn and Peas here. Fresh Kale, Hearts of Palm, Artichoke Hearts, Watermelon with Feta. It's It's delicious and fresh and you'[ll want to go again but don't! The service was impeccable! Prompt courteous and ever so friendly. Making plans to take the whole family."}
{"text":"To me best  Brazilian steak  restaurant in Las Vegas.  I have been  here numerous  times and the service  from staff never failed me. Tried Texas de Brazil  and via brasil among  others. Nobody tops this place when it comes to service and quality  of food."}
{"text":"my sister and I went there over the labor day weekend, the good thing was the restaurant week, the bad thing was restaurant week. we did the special offer. and yes it was really good. the place was packed but our table was waiting for us. the salad bar was awesome. I think you can go and just do the salad bar and it would be good in and of itself. The meat did come and come and come. all great, the only reason I didn't stuff myself was that I wanted that super new York cheesecake for desert. I am soooooooooo glad I did.  when your in the area this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. There was no one at the front desk. I had to wait an awkward 3-5 minutes before someone even acknowledged us. We got to our table and the waitress failed to get us forks, knives and a meat menu. All we had were water, plates and a butter knife. We had to go and scavenge utensils from another table like we're at a cheap $10 buffet restaurant. The waitress was never seen again until it was time to cleanup and collect her tip. My wife got a bunch of side dishes from the salad bar but I stuck with the meats. The side dishes were underwhelming and not fresh. Maybe because it was around 3 in the afternoon but I still expect fresh food at the cost of $52 a head. Needless to say my wife ended up with the runs right after we got back to the hotel. The meats were good and cooked well. The lamb and picanha were my favorites. The pork rib was way too salty and the cheese bread was probably the most memorable dish. Do yourself a favor and go Texas De Brazil instead. The ambiance, food and service is better across the board at the same price (or less)."}
{"text":"We never go far down to summerlin and only went because of a relative. It was really a good experience as we tried Fogo de Chao. Brazilian is really new to me and as a chef, I am impressed with how the meats were cooked. The service was really great, Minh and Chris in particular was really attentive and wanted us to get the best experience.  The only down side is when you get to taste the 7th steak, it gets tiring. I wish there was a sauce so there would be different flavors.   As for the price, it is quite expensive. But hey, this is a really good experience. A good place to have a date or bring a family member to lunch/dinner.   Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great service.  Best Lamb chop and sirloin in town hands down. Worth every penny. I'm so impressed! Will definitely come back again. :)"}
{"text":"I went here with friends who are all big meat eaters. I'm not, so ordered the ocean caught salmon, which was perfectly cooked, as would be expected for $43.  When one of my friends was seved sausage, I wanted a taste. The staff swept over to our table like I was stealing the Mona Lisa!   They instructed me that if I took even one bite of a sausage they would charge me an additional $51, as I would have crossed the menu into the prix fix meat side and have to pay for that option on top of my salmon.  I was glad to be made aware of their prix fix, but the ridigity seemed extreme for a restaurant that considers itself upscale.  I know of no other \"upscale\" restaurant in the US that treats it's customers so rudely... and serves it's butter in those cheapo little foil packets one sees at Denny's."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to amaze me, they're just that good!  This location is larger than most and I thought their food was just outstanding.   We were greeted with the usual big smiles and welcoming hello that I have found at all the Fogo locations.   All the teams are really special and this location is no exception.  This is a big spot and there are  lots and lots of tables here.  The salad bars are pretty much the same from location to location but due to a couple of large groups in the house there was a line, very unusual.  This location also had soup, never saw that  before.   I'm not going through all the meats but I must say that they were all outstanding and incredibly flavorful.   My favorites are the lamb chops, pork ribs and short ribs/. We asked for more well cooked and that's what they brought.   All the food was served hot.  They have such a great staff, but I MUST give special Kudos to our incredible server Franci.  Without a doubt one of the best servers we've ever had, at any restaurant.  It's good to see a restaurant of this size working so well to create an exceptional dining experience."}
{"text":"WOW!! This place had me stuuuffed! The salad bar was huuuge! It def was not just a salad bar. It was more like an appetizer bar too! They even had this delicious butternut squash soup that i very much enjoy :] (i got 2 bowls)  They have the bombest cheese rolls that come with a liquidy type sauce.. Chimichurri? Haha and this fried platain fries that were good too!   Their GARLIC SIRLOIN was my faaav!! Soo juicy and melt in your mouth garlicky goodness!   The waiters/waitresses were extremely nice and accomodating! The manager even got us a great picture with the people serving us meat!  I forgot to say, there are people walking around with different types of meat. They give you a coaster looking sign to flip over. Red for no meat and green for meat! They'll come to with alllll types of meat when your coaster is green!   Their desserts are good: The pineapple one is this round, thick pineapple slice with a candied, caramalized topping like creme brulee WITH ice cream! The chocolate molten is my favorite! WITH ICE CREAM! The brazilian flan was good too! Better than any other flan i have ever had."}
{"text":"A little pricy but if you appreciate a great deal of good tasting meats this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The meats were super salty. I loved the mashed potatoes, bread, and banana whipped cream. I would go back for those, but it's pretty pricy for just that."}
{"text":"We dine at a local, non chain brazil steakhouse in Summerlin and love it there! We decided to give this one a try because they are all over the states. Upon arriving, parking was a nightmare! There were only about 20 spaces available to park, then all the other 50 spaces were coned off for \"valet\". Boo! We were seated right away, got our drinks, and hit the salad bar... Salad bar was mediocre. Salad, salami, potato and chicken salad, cold vegetables (broccoli and asparagus) fresh mozzarella balls, prosciutto,white rice and black beans etc. not impressive...it was pretty dark in the restaurant and very busy. People running around constantly! The cheese filled bread they bring to the table were lightly filled with cheese and airy... Generally, other brazil steakhouses let you choose your sides, but this one brought out fried polenta(dry and cold), mashed potatoes from a box, and fried bananas. The meat service WAS really good... Bacon wrapped filet and chicken, phenomenal Parmesan crusted pork tenderloin. The price was $49.00pp, $10 more per person then our preferred spot... They'll need to work on specials for the local scene. Overall a good experience, but I'll save the gas and go to our spot where it's more relaxed, with superior service and an awesome salad bar!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. Good price for quality of food. Waiters are always nice, service in dining room is always good. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because no matter your reservation you always end up waiting for your table anyway. Otherwise food is great"}
{"text":"My family and I were here on a Saturday for their Brunch. Definitely worth it for the price. The meats they serve are tender, juicy, and very tasty. The 2 stars missing are because of the lack of customer service- and I'm not even a hard to please person.  Our main waiter had a very serious face, he didn't even smile, doesn't ask how we are doing. When he was asked to refill our coffee, he came in to refill the coffee coming in the table between me and my cousin almost hitting my face without saying excuse me!! I know we are there for food but it totally ruins your meal when your waiter rude and useless!  Food- 5 stars Customer service- 1 star"}
{"text":"today was my very first time to this restaurant. i just began a company and steven made stylesmakefights.com's night. he is the best waiter and worth a big hug from whomever reads this.  management he is why smf will come forever."}
{"text":"We had high expectations for our visit and we're disappointed. Food was great but we expected the service we have had at other similar venues and we're disappointed. The meat servers were slow to come and we had to continue to ask for the meat we preferred as well as clean plates and table foods to be replenished. Other tables seemed to get more attention so maybe it was our service area. Was a big event for us with out of town family. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Meat and veggies- what's not to like?!  The servers are everywhere and always willing to assist. Service was great. Food  was spectacular.  I personally did not like everything I tried but I tried everything I could. My faves were the  variety of veggies and cheese bar plus the lombo and lamb chops. My sister really enjoyed the ribs which for some reason I didn't try since I was hooked on the lombo.  Huge wine list and I had a glass but when I go back and I will go back I will elect not to have wine so I can try their rum speciality drink that they bring around on a cart. Desserts were nothing fancy. Had the creme brûlée but honestly I've had better.  Full 5 stars for the choices and service.  Oh and they bring these cooked bananas to the table along with some bread type things. Both were delicious but I only had one bread type thing since I wanted to save room for the meat.  Craving the lombo as I write this... Mmmmm."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMM. All you can eat quality meat?! This steakhouse is great, I can never go to Fogo without leaving and feeling so full that I can barely walk."}
{"text":"Okay...now I know I said I wouldn't go back, but my twice a year visit to Scottsdale got me here as one of the people I traveled with really want to go.  This Tim they get all my stars.   First, all the meats were excellent.  I wanted rare and I got rare.   Funny enough the person I was with wanted well done ( go figure ) and sometimes they had to wait for the next round.  Service was five star.   It appears the servers were very on top of it asking if there was something special I wanted.   Sometimes I was actually taking a break and they would ask if I wanted something special.  There appeared to be some new items circulating like pork chops and chicken breast.     But as always the beef ribs and the rib eye were my favorites.  Thanks guys for turning it around!"}

Fogo de chao blows texas out of the water. everything is seasoned very well without being overly salty (which texas de brazil fails at) the only thing that lacks is the salad/hot food bar. though i could care less about salad. i was there for the delicious meat. my favorite was the lamb. the service was also very good. i had my coaster flipped to green and the servers kept coming by so fast ididnt even have time to eat my meats. i had to pause the service just so i can enjoy my lamb. definitely recommend this Brazilian steak house over texas de brazil."}
{"text":"Alright... I have been to a number of these restaurants across the nation, and all pretty good. Here is our experience.... have you ever been to a place where the waiters almost annoy you too much?? This is the place. We could not go without having someone either ask to take our plate, ask us if we are done, ask us if we want a certain meat (that did not help at all by the way), ask us if we want potatoes etc... every minute. very annoying.. and they must have had like 15 waiters working.... the other issue was with the meat. Most of these places I have gone to have a good selection... but they seemed to bring the cheapest meat (top sirloin, sausage, and very dry chicken) about 80% of the time. If you are lucky enough to see something different it was normally gone by the time they came to our table. The eventually brought the beed rib and lamb to our table, but it did take a while. For the price you pay, I would never go back. If you are the manager and you are reading this, just tell the waiters to take a chill pill and relax."}
{"text":"Consistent offerings of service, food, atmosphere and drinks is what makes this franchise successful.   No matter whether I'm at Fogo in DC, Baltimore or here in Scottsdale, I get the same gut-busting food and well-made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt.  A specific note on this particular location- there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night. No judging, but I've never seen that at any other Fogo. Fogo back east is really \"date night\" or the kind of place to pre-game for a bachelor party or a business dinner, but not to bring infants and toddlers. Possibly a by-product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels. IMHO, this is not the place to bring kids, but I respect the rights of anyone to do so. If I was traveling w/ kids in tow and I didn't have a Fogo in my city, it'd be hard to pass up. In any regard, it did not bother me in the least. I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks.   You will easily spend over $75 per person here including tip, so prepare to camp out, eat slowly, enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty.  The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home, it's that good. Don't fill up on salad at the salad bar- you can do that at Olive Garden- but do enjoy the cheeses, mushrooms, vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar. Did you see what I just did there?  Nice wine selections here. Ask for a Brazilian red to enjoy with your meal if you have the coin."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one in SF and after going here I prefer the SF location....The ambiance here feels kind of cafeteria likeIn SF it's dark, romantic and waaaay better furnished! Food is about the the same, but the staff are definitely could use some training from the SF stafff..."}
{"text":"This place has the best cheddar bread balls I have ever had. Similar to other Brazilian buffets. Flip your card over if you want meat, flip it over if you don't. Customer service was amazing. People will check up on you frequently making sure everything is fine. Bacon covered sirloin was my favorite."}
{"text":"We are trying new restaurants lately..trying to broaden our horizons. Went here because we were passing by. The only reason I put two stars is because the customer service is very good. The food was so mediocre. If I am spending 50 dollars per person, plus drinks i expect real mashed potatoes with my food. I do not want potato spuds. It was a waste of money. I would rather go to a small restaurant with excellent food than a large overrated one. 100 percent equivalent to a las Vegas buffet. The meat was fatty, drinks were not good. I don't understand why there are so many good reviews on all of these different places, I feel like it is my duty to be truthful on here! I was not expecting a steakhouse quality meal for the price, but left feeling jipped. Bill for two came out to $165.00. I guess it's a quantity over quality type business. They give so much food, but none of it is delicious. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with all the hype around it. The best part was the salad bar. They are really cheap about serving any good cut of meat and constantly bring around the sirloin. If you want a good cut of meat you have to ask specifically for it and even then you get one small paper thin slice. And while you are still chewing they are trying to give you your bill."}
{"text":"Great food, great meats! Love the passion fruit Caiparinha!"}
{"text":"We've had something similar at a \"Mongolian\" bbq joint down in Florida and it wasn't all that great.  So the wife I don't think had high expectations.  I was looking forward to this meaty delight as I'd heard good things.  Arizona Restaurant week provided a good opportunity to get out and sample this fine establishment.  As it turns out...this is what I was seeking.  The service by the staff that puts the food in front of you was great.  As we grabbed a table at the bar waiting for our buzzer to buzz in less than a minute we had a basket of cheese stuffed bread in front of us.  It was good.  The salad bar was good also.  Tried to go light on that to save room for the delightful meet onslaught that was to occur in the near future.  Notables were the potato, chicken, and apple salads.  All very good.    Now...flip the card over from red to green..and the staff that are running around every few minutes with different cuts of meats will drop by your table and ask you if you want some of what they're carrying.  It's an awesome site...seeing multiple filets skewered and getting hunks sliced off from whichever ones are cooked to your preference.  ...and let us not forget about the bacon wrapped fillet pieces also.  Some of the most flavorful things you will ever taste.  My wife isn't as much of a steak person as I am and she loved them.  The bacon-wrapped chicken was very good also.  The lamb also, very tasty.    The dessert was good also.  Wife had what was a pretty good piece of cheesecake if I recall correctly.  My key lime pie was also pretty good (not the best key lime I've had...but pretty good).  The \"bad\":  This could've been 5 stars.  There were 2 things that kept it from being so (one that bugged me more than my wife, and the other that really irked her and bugged me a little too).  1.  The AZ Restaurant week ad for this says \"During restaurant week guests will also choose from a selection of 12 decadent desserts.\" for the 3rd course.  We were given a choice of 3.  Cheesecake, Key LIme Pie, or a Chocolate cake.  I'm always irritated by false advertising.    2. The service was spectacular by all of the chefs.  It was great in general, until it was time for the bill.  We were beginning to wonder if they wanted us to eat for free.  We were waiting for over 15 minutes since they cleared our table for the bill.  At least 10-15 after someone had told us they would check on our bill.    So Fogo...you almost had 5 stars.  I cannot complain about the food though and the service in getting it to our table.  That part of it was great."}
{"text":"This is the best Brazilian steakhouse I've been to, bar none. The meat options were plentiful and delicious, and the service was great.  I came here with some friends on one of their recommendations as part of a trip to Vegas. He swore by it, and we were not disappointed. First, the salad bar: I could probably have been happy just eating from the salad bar. There are plenty of tasty options, both \"salad-like\" and meatier in nature. The charcuterie options are excellent, as are the pre-made salads. My one disappointment was the feijoada. This is normally one of the things I look forward to at a Brazilian restaurant, but I was not really impressed by the feijoada at Fogo. It was kind of bland and was really more a black bean stew than a feijoada. So that was the one black mark against Fogo.  Second, the meat--what we really came for. There were a ton of delicious options, and they were regularly offered, based on the little green/red cards we could individually place on the table (as opposed to the table-wide red/green card I've typically seen at Brazilian steakhouses). The chicken wrapped in bacon was the disappointment of the night. Other than that, everything was fantastic. The pork was perfectly cooked and tender. The ribeye was thick and juicy. Filet wrapped in bacon. Linguiza (which, when combined with some chimichurri on pao de queso, made for a lovely improvised choripan sandwich). Several other cuts that were also delicious and that aren't immediately coming to mind. My personal favorite was the flank steak. It was really well done, and with a little bit of chimichurri on top, just blew my mind. I had several pieces of it before leaving.  Needless to say, I was rather full when I left. It's a little pricey, but the service and quality of meat makes it worth it. Great experience!"}
{"text":"We've been to a Brazilian steakhouse before and were really looking forward to it.  We went to celebrate a birthday and were so disappointed.  The service was incredibly slow and disorganized. Some of the types of meat never came around to our table. There were not many choices of meat and some of it was fatty and salty. The waitstaff was one step above \"unfriendly\" and they were out of some choices on the dessert menu. Very over priced. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service at this place. Especially If you are a meat lover.  The constant flow and variety of meats available is well worth the money.   I've been to some so called all you can eat. places that tend to slow down the flow of food they bring after your first round. But at this place it just keeps on coming.  Also, the salad bar is amazing. Great quality and variety.  If you're in Scottdale and hungry, this place is a must."}
{"text":"Ive been to 15+ Brazilian steakhouses in various cities, and Fogo is top 2 Ive experienced. The only one i can think of that was better cost approx $120 a head in Hells Kitchen, NYC, which is about triple the cost for Fogo. General manager was extremely polite and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. Good service, polite individuals and the food is incredible. Go here."}
{"text":"Always yummy and always leave happy and full. The house meat was yummy and I can never get enough chimmichurri. Some of the sides are great and some are good but I really go for the meat and that was excellent. Everything was cooked perfect! Love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner last night for his birthday. The service was great they had various recommendations being that it was our first time here. The meats were perfectly cooked and the salad bar had great fresh variety.   Did feel a little disappointed due to the fact that I made a reservation through open table stating we were celebrating my husband's 32nd birthday and no acknowledgment was made throughout the whole dinner."}
{"text":"We had family in from Chicago and went to Fogo last night. What a great time. The food was phenomenal.  The service was excellent.... We couldn't ask for anything better!!! The GM even checked on our experience to ensure we had a great time. One of the favorites was the garlic beef. Smoked salmon and sea bass were good too. The salad bar was really fresh and so much to choose from. I would highly recommend this place. The family and I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I have been here three different times now. I booked my reservations online for my anniversary and was given a complimentary cake. Their lunch pricing is the best time to go. Children are welcome, but I really wouldn't recommend bringing them unless they are meat eaters."}
{"text":"I've heard of Fogo de Chao awhile back and what I had heard were people going nuts about it, they loved it. Then it was my turn to try it out for the first time to see if what these people were saying was what it was all cracked up to be or not. Thank God I didn't pay the bill!!! I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses before but this I wouldn't rate it with the others at all. There was nothing at all special about the meat or in how it was cooked. I've had steak at other restaurants that weren't Brazilian and that steak was a lot better than here. The salad bar was alright, I think I was so shocked with the poor quality of the meat that the salad bar made no difference at all anyways, it was alright, a lot better than the meat if I recall. I was really really surprised and disappointed and of course expecting it to be a whole lot better than what it was, not good at all. Surprised and wondered what all the hype was about after all. Round 2: Went once again at the one in Washington, D.C. also, wrote a review on that one too, check it out!"}
{"text":"After a long 3rd day at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Vegas, my company and I indulged ourselves with some Brazillian AYCE steakhouse meats. I made reservations and we came in as a large party. The staff was very accommodating and led us to a big table.  After some wine, everyone headed to the salad bar except me. I wanted to start with the meat!! Way to be unique right? So there I was by myself at this huge table eating an outrageous amount of meat. Unfortunately, I got sick of the meat fast. It was good and all but I think I just wasn't in the mood for that much meat. I flipped over my card and headed to the salad bar afterwards.  The salad bar was decent and had a good amount of food to choose from but similar to the meat, nothing really stood to me. I loaded my plate with a couple of items and headed back.   Dessert, on the other hand, was delicious and very nicely served in a fancy glass topped with a beautiful flower. Of course we stuck the flower in someone's ear and instagramed a photo.  Nice place overall, but I didn't feel as though it was anything extraordinary. It may have been my appetite that day so I have to give it a second try one of these days.  *** 3.5 stars rounded down this time for the lack of wow factor."}
{"text":"Place is an all you can eat meat steakhouse where they bring to your table recently grilled skewered pieces of meat for you to pick from.  Each server comes with a different type of meat.  They start you with the cold bar which consists of  salad / pickled veggies / cheese / preserved meats, and like-wise.  Once you're ready to eat meat flip your green/red cardboard piece so that they may start coming by to serve you meats.  The closeness of tables and noise levels are too much for an upscale place like this.  Staff is expected to be professional, no less."}
{"text":"The food, service and attention to detail was outstanding! In small talk with our server, Madison we mentioned to her we were celebrating my partners job promotion. she went out of her way to bring his dessert on the plate it was inscribed \"congratulations!\" Also she was able help out the perfect wine! She took her time and was listening to what we wanted! The salad bar was always freshly stocked,  meat kept fresh! They have the option of beef, pork, chicken, & lamb!"}
{"text":"WOW!  This is my first 5-star review for a restaurant.  I believe that 5th star should be held for something really special that made a place stand out.  Fogo did that for me last night.  We wanted to go to a Churrascaria for our anniversary, and being the good Yelper that I am, I read the reviews for Fogo and \"the other one\" which is a couple of miles from my house.  Decided, based on Yelp, to make the drive to Scottsdale.  Great decision.  I made reservations online and noted that it was my anniversary.  Got there and was seated promptly.  Since it was our first time there we got the run down on the coaster signals and the wine specials and then we were off to the salad bar.  The salad bar was good.  Not particularly large, but the selections were not your ordinary salad fair.  It had fresh mozzarella, blocks of Parmesan to shave, salmon, marinated mushrooms, asparagus.  Just great, fresh stuff of which I tried not to over do because of the meat fest I was saving myself for.  That's where the fun begins.  As soon as we flipped our coaster to green...BAM...meat was at our table in 2 seconds.  No joke.  Top sirloin, Parmesan crusted pork loin, pepper crusted lamb, fresh sausages, chicken etc.. Medium rare is medium rare, just the way I like it.  I could go on and on about how well all the meats were cooked.  Tender, juicy, FLAVOR.  For those who do not like a lot of pepper, stay away from the lamb as it is definitely pepper crusted.  I personally couldn't get enough.  Not seeing the meat you want?  Just ask a Gaucho and it will be there within minutes. The fried Polenta dusted with Mozzarella was so flippin good, I'm going to have to try it myself.   After going into protein shock I decided I was done.  My wife wanted just a little taste of chocolate mousse if they had it.  They came back with a piece of the most delicious cake I have ever had in my life on a plate that had \"Happy Anniversary\" drizzled out on the plate..complementary.  That was the 5th star! The price wasn't that bad, but the drinks are a bit pricey.  Dinner with 3 cocktails was $140.  That is more than worth it for a great atmosphere, friendly servers and Gaucho's, terrific food, and genuine hospitality.    This is my new go-to place for family, friends, and business colleagues.  Great job!"}
{"text":"You're going to lay around $52 a plate at dinner time. With a variety of steak cuts, chicken, and sausages. Food was all very good, including the Salad. Service was also excellent, managers came by to check on our evening. The establishment as a whole seems to be lass \"fancy\" than it was a few years ago. However, that's just in reference to what people are wearing. Anyways, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Love it! They have a great salad bar...but make sure not to eat too much here because the meat is the best part. The meat was endless. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet. Make sure to ask for it and regular filet because they dont come around as often with those 2 items. The bread balls are awesome and my favorite. Their flan and creme brulee are well made. The ambiance here is nice as well."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the sirloin and ribeye! Every skewer is cooked differently on every part of the meat, so you can ask for however you want it cooked.  The choices are endless, and the waiters are prompt and fast with coming over to your table to serve you a different meat.  I have noticed everyone else has said this multiple times, but I cannot stress enough how important it is to NOT fill up on the salad bar and the appetizers they serve you (mashed potatoes, french fries, and a dessert). You really will get so full on the meat because it's so heavy in comparison to everything else served. Don't get full on the salad bar and not be able to enjoy the reason you came to begin with!"}
{"text":"great food however for the amount of food i eat the price is WAY to hight. definitely need to go hungry and don't fill up on the bread and salad bar items they have. we came here before for an engagement party then the last time we came was for a 40th birthday party. great place for hosting a large party. they have the back room and then we had the entire restaurant reserved for lunch for an engagement party"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Fogo de chao is nothing short of out of this world. It is expensive, but as soon as you start, you'll know exactly where that money went. Seriously. Try it."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Brazilian steakhouses jn the US. We have been to a few and this is by far the best. The meat is fresh and perfect and wow that salad bar is the best. They also give you 5 star customer service. Great place to celebrate or have a great night out of something fun. Prices are reasonable for what's provided, also great parking and good drinks at the bar. Will always come back, fun to bring out out of state friends over to this place."}
{"text":"I like this place for the experience but it's been hit or miss. I've been to Fogo many times, three times in the past two months. One of those times is was fantastic, one was average and one was a disaster.   Good food if you can get it. Avoid this place on a weekend when it's packed. I saw one person serving meat in the entire restaurant on several occasions one Saturday night. They seem to care only about serving large parties and probably selling drinks more than anything. Then when someone asks what meat I would like to try, they don't come back. I brought two friends for the experience and left embarrassed.   On a good night everything is wonderful!  Salad bar is pretty incredible. Huge selection of fresh veggies, salads, meats, cheese, etc. I'm tempted to just get the salad bar if I go back.   Bottom line, if you haven't been there you should go. Like I said, maybe try it on a weekday when you get better service. It's a fun experience and be sure to come hungry!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here for the second time and boy what a drastic change..... The service was horrible. The meats were very fatty , the manager arguing with my wife and the worst part I got food poisoning from their salad bar. It's day number 2 and I am still recovering after having my head in the toilet most of  day 1.....  what a way to spend $200.00 .........This place is cut!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know where all these good reviews are coming from but this place is horrible. Cheese bread cold 3 times in a row and no taste!person I was with didn't know it was even it was cheese bread. Salad bar not up to par. Fried polenta dry!!! Tabouli no taste.etc,etc do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. If you want good Brazilian go to TBD!!  One star was for the service which was good!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This was my first time at a Brazilian steak house and this was beyond my expectations. Everything about this place was fantastic!!! The whole on off indicator was very cool. If it's your first time there they explain how everything works. Starting off with the appetizer buffet area to actually getting the whole deal with all the different types of steaks. You have the choice of picking rare, medium or well done. The whole dining experience was outstanding!!!! I can't believe we have a location in La I can't wait to go back!!!!! Thank you for the amazing experience."}
{"text":"Awesome. Went tonight for my parents 50th wedding anniversary. First time for them. They went bananas. The food was perfect. The meats were cooked to taste. The salad bar was amazing. Pear salad yum. Got the recipe card to make it in the future. They gave an amazing chocolate cake as a wedding thank you. They management is beyond nice.  We had Robert as a  server so nice. Ashley you rock. Nicest girl. They gave us 40% for military special I was sent in my email. Thank you fogo de chao staff for making my parents day so special. We will be back 100%."}
{"text":"Came here on 24 Jun 2012, here is my review for each specific area I'm rating it against, now keep it mind this is on a high cost end and if people are paying this much then food quality and service should be commensurate.   Service: It was okay service overall, nothing over-the-top. Attentive staff, however, except when I asked one of the waiter if they had salmon he said they do but it was only smoke.   Food: it was average overall, the cold cuts, rice, beans and other items on buffet line was good but nothing to rave about.  Meat: this is suppose to be their best selling point, but I think this is where they failed bad and I thought that they were giving people low bang for the buck. Here is what I mean, first, there was only a few choices of meat compare to some Brazilian restaurant we've been to here in Vegas. Second, when they started going around, they start you and fill you up with cheap cuts, like for example chicken and then some sausage. Then they follow it up with top sirloin, I mean I didn't even see the lamb of leg or prime rib until the end, which I was already full. Third, there was no fish on the menu.  Location: being close to the Strip can mean bad and good, good because you will get more tourist customers. Bad, because when you go out for a nice dinner wearing decent clothes, you should at least expect to see people wearing similar clothing. When we were there we had a group of tourist that looked like they just came back from playing basketball, sleeveless shirt and spandex shorts, and this is supposed to be fine dining?? What a joke!  Now I can't help it but compare this to Via Brasil because I think Via beats this place hands down.  Via Brasil is a bit farther out from the strip, we've been there at least 4 times and all those times we've never seen anyone dress like a yoohoo! I think that the location speaks for itself as well, more middle-classs to wealthy neighborhood nearby so you always see Ferraris/Maserati park upfront. No tourist to deal with really!  The service is way better, they have a waiter/waitress looking at your table the whole time to ensure you don't run out of things. When you are done with your plate, they even take it away and clean/brush crumbs off of your table and gives you a new plate while you are just seating down.  Food: this is where it hit the mark for me, they have more meat selection(just compare both meat menu please) to add, Via has Salmon on Cedar planks, this is my wife's favorite. On one Friday night, they even had one whole roasted pig on a cart wheeled around, what a delicious treat.  Overall, if I am paying this much then I think food quality/service should be commensurate. Go to Via Brasil and you'll know what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! It was my first time at a Brazillian restaurant and I was very impressed. The salad bar had amazing food and was always fresh. When it was time for the meat portion of dinner the servers were constantly bringing us food. It was always hot and amazing. The meat always had so much flavor. The wait staff was always on top of everything. I was very impressed and would love to come back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! I love everything about eating here. The food is amazing and you really get a lot for your money. Most people come here for the meat but it's also Vegetarian friendly! They have a cold buffet where you can choose from many options. If you're worried about the price I recommend going for lunch because it's cheaper. I speak so highly of this restaurant and have always left full and happy!"}
{"text":"First timer here at Fogo de Chao, however I went to a similar Brazilian steakhouse with the same concepts. My cousin, best friend and I came for my birthday. We had drinks beforehand and that kind of filled my stomach. Note to self: don't drink again before Fogo de Chao.   I was happy the reservations weren't filled up because Valentine's Day was the day after. I was even able to easily change our reservations for 30 mins after our original time since we were running behind from drinks.   It was my friends first time as well with no Brazilian steakhouse experience. We were both excited to see what's up with the hype. When arrived we were quickly seated and introduced to the restaurant  The salad bar has plenty of hors d'oeuvre selections ranging from mozzarella balls, crispy bacon pieces, asparagus, you name it.   THE MEATS: That's what this place is really all about. It's honestly like an all you can eat meat buffet! They have all different types of meats and they just keep comin around with meat skewers. They have a card (red side and green side) you flip the card to green side if you haven't had enough and want more and flip it to red if you need a break pretty much  My favorites were the filet mignon and ribeye. FIRE! P.S. are you given a free birthday dessert. I chose the strawberry creme which is actually just cream that is strawberry flavored. It's like slightly melted strawberry ice cream in a cup. I would probably just stick to getting the creme brûlée or a cheesecake had I known. FYI"}
{"text":"Very good service great meat and seafood and the salad bar is fantastic. Very pricy for an off stripe restaurant."}
{"text":"Thanks to my best friend I had the pleasure of trying this place.  It would definitely bust my wallet, but thankfully Gloribelle P. took me here for my birthday.  We came for lunch on a week day so it wasn't too busy. We started with the salad bar and I was really impressed with the quality of the selections. Definitely a step or 2 up from other salad bars at the buffets.  Everything I tried was delicious and you could tell just by looking that all the vegetables were fresh.  The banana on the side, is DELICIOUS. Probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. We couldn't stop eating it, the soft tender banana with the sweetness from the brown sugar was a really nice contrast of flavors.  The cheese bread was good too, but I think I would get sick of it if I had too much.  I think I limited myself to 2 or 3 rolls during the entire meal.  The meat on the other hand was kind of disappointing because most of it tasted like \"blah buffet meat.\" The only one that was good was the pichana. By the time we realized everything else wasn't worth trying we were already full to get seconds on the pichana. That's okay though because we came here to sample.  The service was of course superb, but I wouldn't expect anything less since this is a classy restaurant.  However, I kinda felt like whenever we asked for something our server was quick and prompt, but he  had a slight \"ugh\" reaction. Maybe it was just me? The entire experience is 4 stars while the meat is a low 2."}
{"text":"I love Fogo! It doesn't get any better for carnivores like me. If you want to eat a seemingly endless amount of delicious, perfectly seasoned steak, hot off the skewer, look no further.  Let's be honest though, I've never ordered any food off the menu. This place was built for the full experience, which is start with a light salad from the salad bar, and then eat as much meat as you can without having a heart attack.  If you go for lunch, the prices are about $35 each. Dinner is around $50 each for the full meat skewer experience. If you're like me, you can easily eat $35 worth of meat in one sitting (vs buying it at a restaurant) so while the prices may seem steep compared to many other places, you can truly get your money worth.  There's something like 17 varieties of meat that comes out on skewers, if I remember right. Anything from Sirloin, New York Strip, Ribeye, Filet Mignon, a couple varieties of Chicken, pork with parmesean cheese sprinkled on it, lamb, and a few varieties of meat wrapped in bacon. I found that basically all of it was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and all the servers who bring the meat are extremely friendly and courteous. And quick! If you leave your \"meat coaster\" flipped to green (indicating you want more meat) you will have a meat mountain on your plate within a few minutes.  My last visit, we went for a friend's birthday, and they also told him he could pick any dessert on the menu free of charge. He chose the raspberry cheesecake, which was a very generous piece and it was also delicious. Do yourself a favor if you haven't eaten here...eat here."}
{"text":"As far as Brazilian BBQ goes, it's the best. BUT, I've been here a couple times and every time I leave I find myself wanting more. The meats are cooled deliciously, but if I'm paying the price for dinner, I could pass on some of the cheaper meats. When the waiters are coming around with the sausage and chicken pieces, I say no but get a plate full anyways. And when I'm looking for the filet and better cuts, there is no one to be found. So the idea of getting full on the cheaper stuff and only give so little pricier cuts is a great business plan for the restaurant but not for me."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! A must if you enjoy a variety of great cuts of meat and an unforgettable dining experience. Everything is first class from the food, drinks, and service. I have dined here several times and it gets better everytime! Make sure you order the signature Brazilian Caipirinha! (Don't bother with the other Brazilian style steakhouses...Im a local and have tried them all...Fogo is the best.)"}
{"text":"First we call to set a reservation for our party and the woman on the phone has no idea what is going on...we finally figure out how to set a reservation and get locked in at 10pm. On the way to the restaurant we called to make sure our delay of 4 min would be alright....WOW! No we are told the place is closed and the reservation is void?! Screw this place, Texas de Brazil and tons of steak restaurants are better than this place anyway. Lost a table of 10 because of terrible employees."}
{"text":"MEATFEST!  MEATFEST! place was clean, service was excellent.  did I mention MEATFEST! we didn't drink and bill was $149 WITH tip for 2 people.... they had an awesome salad bar, TONS of MEAT, and they just kept coming, and coming, and coming.....  I couldn't get them to let me eat it right off the stick, despite it being my anniversary.  Best. MEATFEST. EVER."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb every time I come here the meat is fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Meat coma.  Prepare for a meat coma.  Last night my husband and I celebrated our sixth wedding anniversary.  After much debate on where we were going to celebrate Fogo won our votes.  We've visited another similar style restaurant in Ahwatukee so we knew what we were in for - or did we?  Fogo last night was very happily a different experience from the last time we did a Brazilian steak house.  This was upscale and so much more busy.  We made reservations on line and while we were five minutes late - it wasn't even an issue.  For the record we had an incredible time and I guess the next few things are just minor but I think would have added another star.  My hubby is chatty and can strike up conversation with anyone.  But the staff was not so much into it.  They didn't engage his quick little one liners and didn't feel obliged to \"listen\" to anything.  The expeditors were a little more willing but not by much.  I was seriously starting to get nervous by how fast everyone moves @ the restaurant.  So fast in fact a collision happened right in front of us.  Plates went everywhere.  The hubby tried (for the record this was his third attempt) to engage a gaucho about how they cook the meat - this gentleman looked @ Josh and said \"hmmm I dunno\" - I got the feeling he didn't understand what was being asked of him.  He just knew to cut the meat off the skewer and continue on.  Perhaps that's what they have been advised to do.  Not sure.  It was just awkward.  Everything was good.  The cherry peppers were delish (my first time) all of the meat was delish.  Not very seasoned but good.  The purity was awesome.  The salad bar was great.  I made the best Caesar salad I've had in a while.  The mozz and parm were FANTASTIC!  Hubby loved the little bread basket. The wait staff said that they were told what goes into it but not so much how to make them.  (you see a pattern here with the chatty)  :)  At the end of the night when we could take no more we were approaching comaville we waited for our staff person to bring the check.  This is what confuses me.  Who are we tipping.  The gauchos, the really sweet gal that never let my water go empty, the cutie that \"crumbed\" our table?  The gal previously mentioned asked if we had received our check.  And then went to find it.  When everyone was running around furiously this is where we waited the most?  Hubby says that it's almost nice to not feel like they are rushing us out the door.  But when we wanted to leave - well, we waited.  All in all it was a very successful anniversary.  We will be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Was very impressed. It is an expensive meal but not something I'm just going to because it's Tuesday. The servers were very down to earth and joking around. We went as a party and the food was delicious. It is all it's cut out to be. Lamb, ribeye, chicken, pork, all of it. Just delicious. I've been to several steak houses and this is a very unique steak house that you will surely remember. It is a very cool change of things with the green card (feed me) and the red card (Stop feeding me). The one knock was the seafood tower. For the price have had much better sea food towers. The overall experience and quality of food is too good for them to get anything under a 5 star!!!! The salad bar is really cool with some unique cheeses, fresh salads, and some cool sides. If you want to change it up and enjoy yourself go here!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great, friendly service.  And yes, the free after-dinner (or before) chocolates at the hostess stand are delicious.   The Gauchos do not use Brazilian Portuguese terms for the meats... this was kind of disappointing since I was expecting that part of the fun learning experience.  Even if they have to explain what they said, that's part of the fun.  To skip this aspect seems... lazy.    Anyway, the Picanha is called \"house special.\"  The bacon-wrapped filet mignon is CLEARLY the best choice; DO NOT waste time or stomach space on chicken. The sausage was ok, definitely not the tastiest part of the meal, nor the best I've ever had.  It wasn't even second or third best.  I'm not a fan of lamb, so I skipped that choice. The porterhouse was pretty good, but I suggest you ask for medium rare or medium since the well done cut is kind of a waste (and it wasn't very good).    Why waste room on the salad bar?  However, if you do, you'll find it has great options: asparagus, sun dried tomato, green olives, chilled grilled zucchini, spinach, lettuce, greens, tabouleh, etc.  They offer a free cheese bread; IT'S A TRAP!  Yes, it's REALLY good.  But that's how they sucker you into eating that crap instead of the EXPENSIVE MEATS!  The lemonade is more like limeade; it's very tangy, and I needed to add sugar.  The crème brûlée was very good, large even for two people.  It's a nice way to top off your meal if you still have stomach space and failed to eat enough meat.   Do yourself a favor and be sure to make a reservation.  Immediately after I was seated, I saw a tour bus full of Japanese tourists come in with their group and I was really thankful I had made a reservation."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for my anniversary. It was great. Service was great food was fantastic. I did not have time to print the free dessert coupon and it states very clearly it needs to be printed and they still honored it. I loved the lamb chops most they were perfectly seasoned and came right off the bone. The drinks at the table were also great."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant. The staff is very friendly, attentive to their tables, and in general the atmosphere is very quiet and refined. Most importantly, the food is amazing. The choice of meat is excellent."}
{"text":"I came to Fogo de Chao because my fiance was given a gift certificate. We had enough money for 2 dinners. I found the place to be kind of a meat over-load. The side orders they bring out were kind of bland- the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box. The corn bread was ok. I wasn't a fan of the plantanes. The meats were good, but how much meat can you eat? My favorite item was the bacon wrapped chicken, but could I eat 50.00 worth of chicken? No. The salad bar was nice, and I thought the cold meats and cheeses there were a nice touch, but really hard to eat that much food in one sitting. The concept is novel- carving of the meat from the giant knives at table side though!"}
{"text":"Great selection of sides, and meats.... Will definitely recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"We have always been a fan of Texas De Brazil, other Brazilian steakhouses were just okay. This all changed last week when we checked out the new location in Summerlin for lunch. We LOVED it! The hostess was so sweet and sat us promptly. The location is beautiful, bright, and very modern. The service was top notch, and when we asked for a side of chimichurry, the server, Isaiah quickly brought us some, as well as a delicious and (very) hot sauce. It was amazing.  Salad bar was so fresh and really the best quality ingredients! I could come back for just the tomato soup and salad! Meat was super tasty, and the younger guy serving the meat was so enthusiastic about us trying all his favorites. The sides were fresh, and I love that it comes with the crispy polenta. The first batch of polenta was good, but they had put out a new fresher, crispier batch which our server promptly brought saying \"here, I had them make more, it's so good fresh.\"  We will be back! The girl at the front was cute, she even reminded us to take a chocolate to go"}
{"text":"Meat meat meat!  This place is perfect for a fatty like me.  All I do is sit there, flip the card to green, and my plate just fills up with MEAT!    The food here is delicious,  the last time I was here,  I was pregnant and I didn't feel right leaving a review because everything I ate had to be burned.  This time around,  I asked for medium rare everything and it was DELICIOUS.  I had expected the meat to be salty, but it wasn't salty at all.    The meat sliced through so easily,  the flavor was awesome,  and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the garlic beef!  I also got a little bit of their basil salad dressing and dipped a few pieces of meat into it, and oh man, it was heaven.  Speaking of salad dressing, their salad bar is one of the best I've had.   I love their tomatoes, their cheeses, their salmon, their salads, and the basil salad dressing is a must have.  Don't eat the chicken, it's dry, and that is all :)  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have come here 3 years in a row for Thanksgiving. We've come back time and again for a reason: the food is amazing and so is the service. This year had to be the stand out best, which is why I'm writing this review! Every gaucho was above and beyond nice and helpful and so were the servers. I've never experienced such positive, accommodating service from so many different directions. Alejandro was so above and beyond he was the most personal and talkative, he remembered what we liked from the very first time he came to our table and kept coming back with exactly what we wanted! Fabrício was also so kind and helpful and brought back cuts we wanted whenever they were cooked just how we liked too. Finally, Minh (a manager I believe?) was so accommodating and helpful always making sure we were well taken care of and being detail oriented and calling over any cut we were wanting at any point in time. We will definitively be back again soon!"}
{"text":"excellent salad bar, wide variety of meats, great service, planning return visit."}
{"text":"Heaven for meat- and steak- lovers! I reserved a table for a family dinner here and everyone was happy with this choice. They keep bringing you different kinds of meat cuts until you tell them to stop. They also have great salad (and not only salad) bar and very tasty appetizers that they keep bringing as you keep enjoying your meat. The prices are pretty decent for the amount and quality of food that you are getting. Come hungry and don't get tempted by the wine-wait till the waiter is gonna stop by with some great cachaca!"}
{"text":"Liked this place a lot. Food was good service was excellent. The drink selection is amazing! And you have to try their chocolate cake! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to start off by saying that this is the first time I have ever been let down by any Brazilian Steakhouse I have ever been to, especially Fogo! I usually eat at the location by the Strip but we were told this location was newer and so we decided to try because we didn't think there would be much of a difference.  I was wrong!!!!! I mean the concept of  a Brazilian Steakhouse is phenomenal! I mean who doesn't like an endless amount of all you can eat steak, chicken, filet, ribs, sausage,  ect!  The salad bar was a huge disappointment, they say it's the same as the other locations  but it definitely is NOT. The meat taste very different as well in my opinion.  Our waiter that night told us that it was different because the cooking process was completely  different. The caparinhas are an absolute must! It is a signature Brazilian drink that is to die for! But, watch yourself because they do creep up on you. The desserts are all delicious. Service was great and are waiter was as well! (Diego )"}
{"text":"Horrible value for the cost. This was our worst experience at a Fogo, and we won't be back. The more expensive offerings were never brought to our table. The men offering meat had no idea what they had. And the Filet Minion was definitely NOT Filet Minion."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.. thank you Mihn and to all the great staff for making us feel welcome. We will be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and attentive staff. The meat selection is wonderful however the parmesan crusted pork was out of this world delicious. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with my fiancé, we love coming to fogo but this location specifically for our date nights. Everyone is attentive, amazing customer service from hostess,waiters,servers and the manager! The food was amazing as usual.  Thank you for another great night."}
{"text":"Just in case you fell off the turnip truck....  Rodizio Brasileriro are all about meat. SO if you don't like meat and you give the place two stars; you're dumb.   The salad bar was fresh and had interesting selections. They didn't have bacon bits. They had strips of bacon. I thought that was cool. The asparagus was perfect.   Now about the meat!  Beef Ancho (Rib Eye) was the best. It was tender and flavorful. I literally cut it with my fork.   most of the cuts were prepared more than one way. We usually say \"no chicken!\" When we go to rodizios but the bacon wrapped chicken smelled so go; I had to try it.   Part of the experience is the smell. There is just something about the smell of open fire and roasting meat that appeals to me on an emotional level.   They also have an impressive wine selection and the wait staff was top notch.   (vegans... go away! you ruin everything!)"}
{"text":"Great customer service.  We never had to wait for waiters and they were quick with requests. Anything lamb was my favorite. Victor was very personable and friendly and took suggestions to make their restaurant better. The only reason I did not put 5 stars is I would like more fruit at the salad bar and would love to see grilled pineapple served with the meats."}
{"text":"They can take all of my monies. Alll of my monies. The amazing salad station. The really cool waiters wearing boleros bringing around skewers full of high quality meat cuts down to the delicious wines served. Worth the $55 per person. Every time I come here I feel at home. I feel loved and wanted and just happy. This place has the best customer service around. Tips Come hungry. Do not fill yourself up at the salad bar. Ask for small portions so that you can properly sample everything before going heavy on what you really want. Lastly? Make room for dessert!  One more thing, make the reservation. You do not want to get stuck waiting an hour to be seated... oh yeah, They have beautiful restrooms. And a bar area. Also they valet your car. Huge plus!"}
{"text":"From my personal experience tonight with Fogo de Chao, I will not be returning.  The meat was fair quality and the salad bar had such a poor design you could hardly scoop the food. Our server never cleared the dirty plates, they piled up at the end of the table. The server never came back to get us more drinks, only refilled water once over the 2 hour dinner. We went to the bar and got our own drinks.   At the end the manager was friendly and that's the reason for the 2 stars."}
{"text":"My father and I come here every time we come out to AZ for spring training. We are bigger men, so the all you can eat stands out to us. The food was amazing and you can really get a lot of different types of meats. Which all all very flavorful. I'm giving a 4 star only because we got a couple rounds of meat and then our plates were completely empty. So I kinda just stared at the manager and he saw as sent the next four guys from the kitchen straight to our table. I guess that was okay but waiting 5 minutes to be seen sucked."}
{"text":"I went on Feb. 15 and this place was more packed that an asian buffet for crab legs. In part it was a little annoying because of the amount of people and the movement of the staff (we where seated next to kitchen entrance).  The food it was good but I had better at Texas de Brasil also more expensive . I didnt see anything special until the end of the meal when they gave my wife a Gift Certificate or a voucher for 1 lunch or dinner on them. That is a big saving but you have to use it in less than a month.  Overall, for the amount of meat and fried banana that I had $51.50(per person) is a little too much. Selection of meats that I saw all around where about 10 counting that you have ask for beef or pork ribs every time , so someone go on the back and get it.  I am not sure if  coming back."}
{"text":"The meat was fantastic and they just kept on coming too fast I had to turn my card over to red honestly The servers are amazing and on point. The manager went out of his way to make a personal special for the table and we asked him to turn the heat up (spice level) and he did Best location Brazil style meat period.  Favorite Brazil steakhouse!!"}
{"text":"They say they take reservations but they do not honor them. We arrived at 715 for a 730 reservation and were told multiple times that we were next to be seated though they continued to seat multiple parties ahead of us. At 745 we asked how much longer and the host told us there were still third in line to be seated, so basically another 15-30min wait. I'm pretty patient and I understand they were busy but they should just say they don't take reservations. We were starving and eventually decided we couldn't wait any longer. It was a complete waste of time and practically ruined our night."}
{"text":"We went for the first time to try this restaurant since it was restaurant week and it did not disappoint. The only thing different during restaurant wek is the discounted price. When we arrived we were immediately seated and the experience began. You can go to the salad bar and to get the protein started you simply flip the coaster to green.   The picanha steak was to die for and I had several helpings. Servers are very attentive and the food just keeps coming. We would now add this restaurant to our list of go to. I cannot think of a thing that could have been better which was amazing since it was so busy when we were there."}
{"text":"This was my first Brazillian Steakhouse experience, but it won't be my last! Everyone has a card. Green card means you want them to bring you meat. You can say yes or no to the options that come over. When you need a break, you turn your card to red. I tried flank steak (so tender and delicious), filet mignon (bacon wrapped was not as good as the plain. The filet was my favorite cut), house sirloin (this was my second favorite cut), ribeye, parmesan crusted pork tenderloin (I did not care for this. It was very salty and bland), bacon wrapped chicken breast (the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor), chicken thigh (this was really good), and pork ribs (ribs were tough and not very good). There was a great salad bar that had a variety of fruits, vegetables, and salads. The staff was friendly and offered suggestions. They moved quickly and were at your table several times to make sure you were well taken care of."}
{"text":"If you like to eat this is the spot for you, very high end (about 50.00 per person) but it's basically all you can eat, and about the highest quality you can get. Huge salad bar and about any meat you'd want to try. The cool thing is they bring it out too the table and cut it off the skewers and onto your plate, until you can't eat anymore. But save room and time for desert too. Must try!"}
{"text":"What's that you say? A VEGAN going to a Brazilian Steakhouse? How can this be?   Two Words: SALAD BAR!   Set in a Fine Dining Atmosphere Fogo De Chao offers a Pristine Salad Bar fit for a Vegan Queen. Choices like Brazilian Hearts of Palm, Whole Shitake Mushrooms, Jumbo Asparagus, Whole Artichoke Hearts, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Butter Lettuce and the list goes on and on.   Some of the traditional side dishes are also vegan safe like the fried bananas and also the fried polenta with no cheese. Both are very delicious!   Trust me you wont leave hungry. I've been twice now and would gladly dine here again anytime!  P.S.  The staff was incredible, our service was flawless and, we were completely taken care of every second of our visit."}
{"text":"This is probably the closest thing a real Brazilian churrascaria. Growing up in Brazil we used to go to this type of restaurant on a regular basis. The Salad bar is amazing and has enough selection for all types of eaters, even vegetarians. The meat selection is amazing, always cooked to perfection, right amount of seasoning and they will bring you whatever you want and at the temperature that you like. I highly recommend trying. Traditional Caipirinha! They are so good and good for you too!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is great. Really really busy and hectic.. I'd rather go on an off day on an off time."}
{"text":"My wife and myself both work as waiters on the Strip. Had to work New Years Eve. So, we decided to treat our family to a New Years Day lunch to celebrate the New Year. We decided to try this place. We were really looking forward to it. But it was a let down. When we made our reservation, no one mentioned that they would be charging dinner prices for New Years day lunch. When we walked in, the place was very very hot. The waitress told us that it's very cold when they get there in the morning, so they blast the heater. Well, ok. But once it's time for business, shouldn't the customers comfort be a consideration.  They tell you that they work in a team. But honestly, it leads to impersonal, amateur service. We were a party of 4. We ordered water. Another waiter then brought the water. But only brought water for 2 of us. We had to flag down another server and ask for 2 more glasses. The food was good, not great. One thing that I found really dumb was, after we had been eating for almost 30 minutes, a waiter approached and asked if we would like to try their sauces. 2 people in our party were almost finished. He ended up bringing mint jelly and horseradish sauce. They were really good. But again, this was not offered until our meal was almost over.  It wasn't busy when we were there. When we we seated, there was only one other table. And only 2 other tables came in during our meal. But still, what you get is a bunch of waiters standing around, completely indifferent to the customers needs. Service would be so much better if you have one waiter, who would then know what is happening at your table, and can anticipate your needs.  And then, as I mentioned above, when the check came, it was dinner pricing ($50. per person), instead of the normal $40. per person for lunch(our party was 2 adults, and 2 daughters). Working on the Strip, I know many restaurants have higher prices for New Years Eve. But none have higher New Years Day lunch prices.  I gave this place 2 stars because the meats were fairly good.  O' well. We gave it a shot. Wish I could day it was a good experience. But it wasn't."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Fogo de Chao, and it met my expectations. I was a little nervous because the main idea behind the restaurant is basically \"all the meat you can eat\", and I don't typically eat very much meat. I also knew going in that it would be pretty spendy, and Fogo met that expectation as well. Don't expect a menu; you won't get one. Instead, you get a \"guide\" to the meat that will be delivered to your table via gaucho-wearing servers in blue embroidered button-downs (interesting combo, but hey- how else will you combine the traditional Brazilian concept with Scottsdale professionalism?). And the meat just keeps coming! Flip your coaster from red to green to signal the gauchos that you need meat. Need a break to breathe, stretch, unbutton? No problem! Flip the ol' coaster back to red and they leave you alone for a bit. The salad bar is a nice addition to a seriously protein-heavy (non?) menu. That definitely helped me, since I don't eat red meat on a regular basis; I was able to pace myself a little better by starting with the salad (fyi: mix the ranch dressing with the basil sauce. Amazing.). The restaurant space is HUGE and loud. It's very difficult to have a conversation, and when you have your green coaster showing, the gauchos are constantly visiting your table. We made a reservation because Fogo was crazy busy with spring training crowds in town. We arrived early, sat in the bar for almost an hour, and when I checked with the hostess, apparently they 'tried' to buzz us on the little flashy-thingy, but it didn't work, so they gave our table away! We did get seated almost immediately following that, and our drinks were comped, so it was taken care of very well. I'll be going back here, but probably in a year or so; it's really expensive and it's a TON of meat, but it was amazing food. Selections to try: the bacon-wrapped filet mignon was so moist and flavorful! Make sure you get some of the cheeses and prosciutto from the salad bar, and definitely mix the ranch and basil dressings- to die for!"}
{"text":"Not only do I really like meat that is brought over and carved in front of my face, but I loveee having my selection of salad and smoked meats and cheeses. I honestly don't think it's very worth it for me to come to a place like this because I can't eat that much food anymore (compared to when I was 17 and could probably eat an entire cow). Because of this, I only come for lunch because it's slightly cheaper with similar food (if not exactly the same) as dinner.   This particular Fogo de Chao has great service and a really great manager. I was really impressed and it made my food taste even better!"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint.  Make sure you come hungry.  The service and selection are amazing.  They serve as a team so you never have to wait to ask anyone for anything.  It does not matter who is walking by.  Should you need something anyone will bring it to you.  Including any cuts of meat you want to visit again or haven't tried.  Great for a date or company party.  We have done both and were very happy.  This place will always be a crowd pleaser; if you have company from out of town they will not be let down.  I highly recommend the Sangria.  It is made from scratch."}
{"text":"This place is 100% worth experiencing.  Our server John-Pierre provided a thorough guidance of what was unique on the menu and suggesting the types of beverages that would go well with the meals.    From the onset, the staff was friendly and extremely hospitable.  They are clearly providing a customer service environment to enrich your overall experience.  No complaints when it came to ambiance and service!     Additionally, our beef, chicken, and/or any other types of meats were top quality, as the Chef spared no detail uncovered.  A welcoming location that will make you want to return for sure."}
{"text":"We went here for 0ur 6 yr wedding anniversary. Amazing food. Amazing staff. They even brought  us a huge dessert  on the  house for our special  night. 50$ a person  was well worth this memory! !"}
{"text":"Marvelous. Unique. Filling and accommodating. Would go here so so often if I could, or if I could eat this much all the time!   Fair warning- places like this are usually a flat $50 + alcohol, so if you are on a date plan to spend at least $150.   If you haven't experienced Brazilian steakhouse before, you are missing out on a terrific culinary experience.   The salad bar is terrific, and gives you an opportunity to load up with the greens, the fruits and the starches. It is a top notch salad bar.   Then when you sit down, you are treated to a cavalcade of delicious meats being served to you, one at a time, to accompany your meal. You can have as many as you want, and as much as you want. The quality of the cuts and their preparation is of the calibre you would expect at the nicest steakhouse- but this is all you can eat.   Truly a great place for celebration, I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"The team at Fogo De Chao is so accommodating! We bring a large group here several time a year and everyone is so easy to work with. Danielle Heywood is their event coordinator and she couldn't be more pleasant to work with., and the rest of the team is equally as flexible and fantastic. We will continue to bring our groups here and I would recommend this location to anyone  who needs private dining for a small or large group. Thanks for being awesome team Fogo!"}
{"text":"Was absolutely fabulous everything from the service , price, quality of meats ......it was the best for you dollar !"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Fogo.  The first was for an evening Yelp Eiite Event and this visit was for lunch with the Las Vegas Restaurant Week Fall 2012 pricing.  For a few dollars more than the normal lunch price, you get  a choice of 3 desserts and a contribution is made to Three Square.  The salad bar has fewer items at lunch than dinner, but they have the most common items you'd want including hearts of palm, some excellent sliced cheese (one of my favorites), chilled asparagus, and other items besides greens for salad.  The servers come around with their skewers of meat.  Yesterday's hit for me was the garlic steak.  What great garlic flavor!  I also enjoyed some lamb chops, boneless chicken breast wrapped with bacon and pichana to name a few. In addition, you have some of the cheese puffs to start out and you get sides of mashed potato, fried and glazed plantain, and polenta sticks.  For dessert, I chose the turtle cheesecake which was very good.  This is a very solid, well priced coma-inducing lunch.  You want to come home and sleep for an hour or so just as you did after your mother's holiday dinners when you fell asleep during the football game.  I like this place!"}
{"text":"We ate here around 3pm on a Saturday and got right in! Food was of corse amazing. The service was incredible! 10/10 will recommend!!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to Fogo. I seek them out in EVERY new city I go to. This is the 5th one I have been to...and probably the 100th visit. The food is ALWAYS amazing. The salad bar here was pretty decent. By far my favorite salad bar is in Chi-town. But for a chain this is one of the best chains ever. My only gripe about anything here is their parmesan encrusted pork tenderloin. It was very dry and just not worth eating. I would have much rather had more beef ancho or filet. The cheese bread they put on the table is addictive. I could probably sit there and just eat 5 or 6 bowls of that alone. Before you leave grab a few of their after dinner chocolate mints...they are at the hostess counter."}
{"text":"Went for a late Valentines Day date.... very easy to make reservations and got seated right away. The ambience was nice. The meat selection was ok. Some of the meats needed additional salt, seemed bland. As far as the Salad Bar, wasn't impressed at all. Having lived in Brazil, I was looking forward to the black beans (Feijao) and rice with farofa. It was super bland.... needed a lot of salt to taste good. The rest of the salad bar items were just ok in my opinion. Wasn't too happy about getting offered shrimp, just to find out it was an additional $20 added to your bill. Not cool. In the end we weren't upset with experience but will never return again. There are a few better options in Las Vegas. It's also more expensive than some other restaurants with same style of food. The one positive thing that my wife was very grateful for was the Servers going out of their way to bring her well done meat as she is pregnant and can't eat the meat rare."}
{"text":"Meat lovers this is your heaven...the salad bar was great..love the basil sauce I was dipping the meat with it... they have variety of meat fun of the lamb chops"}
{"text":"Great customer service. We went there to celebrate my mom's birthday.  Very nice atmosphere. Truly a wonderful dinner with many selections to choose from in the salad bar and meats.   Can't go wrong choosing this place customer service is great and the food is scrumptious. My mom enjoyed her birthday dinner very much because of the great attentive service we received. We will be back for sure in the future."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for years to go to this place that I have heard such great things about, because I'm a carnivore like no other. The Decour was nice, the salad bar was OK, but the meat was beyond subpar. The meat was not only over cooked but what they claim to be filet mignon tasted like it had the texture of round steak. The lamb chops were OK, but they were overcooked as well. Not a hint of pink was to be seen. I was greatly disappointed and would recommend Ruth Chris and spend a few extra bucks. The only reason why I'm giving this place more than one star is because the service was better than average."}
{"text":"of course they have good food! and its not that expensive, 50 per person unlimited ()  but if you go there at first they gonna serve you a lot and then they are not going to serve you for 40-45 minutes!!! because they want you to feel full and not eat anymore! its called unlimited but they have a limit and they make you to eat less! service is not good! you have to ask them to give you food! and at the end they ask you for tip! rude!"}
{"text":"Amazing service as usual. Though they were extremely busy with it being Restaurant Week and slashed dinner prices, everybody was attentive and created the Fogo Experience that can't be matched."}
{"text":"This place is quantity over quality.. The meat is so fatty and has no flavor. I kept asking for medium and the meat was rare and fatty.  The salad bar was not good either. There are so many great buffets on the strip that i would not waste my time going off the strip to this place.  Try the Wicked Spoon, inside the Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"This was a new experience for me.  You get a coaster that is red or green. Set it on green and they come by with all kinds of meat. Garlic flavor beef was great. Bacon wrapped beef and chicken were not to be skipped! Sausage and ribs soon followed. I finally turned my card to red, so they would stop. Lol Yeah, I put it back to green when I saw garlic beef coming around again."}
{"text":"Meat-astic! As an uber-carnivor, Fogo is one of my all-time favorite dining destinations!"}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day, we had reservations of course and we had to wait a few minutes that was fine. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The salad bar was disappointing no cheese, my son and I thought we found cheese I asked a staff member and she said its kind of like cheese. We found out from my daughter it was heart of palm in no way is that like cheese. The meat men were on top of it our cards were green we had meat my card was red they left me alone it was great over stuffed on animal. I had a great Mother's Day. They need to step up the salad bar not enough choices and no cheese."}
{"text":"As I sit here, consumed with a meat based hangover, I have fond memories of last evening.  The service, the food, the crowd all fabulous.  I can't thank them enough, for a graduate student who has had dreams of reaching meat nirvana, this was an excellent opportunity."}
{"text":"Last time we were here was a year ago. Although everything went well during our visit, we just preferred the salads and way the meats were seasoned and cooked at TdB.  Yesterday, we decided to stop by before going to a show at the HardRock. Glad we did! Their lamb chops and leg of lamb were phenomenal. Just about every red meat we tried were good except for the top sirloin which had too much gristle. The kale salad was delicious, the sweet pea soup wasn't my favorite but the meats more than made up for it. The gauchos were super nice and accommodating. Service was exceptional especially from our server, Jose. We're shifting our loyalties back to Fogo!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Fogo! The absolute best Brazilian bbq I ever had! And my wedding was at a Brazilian bbq restaurant! Fogo is still better tasting!"}
{"text":"For my 100th review, I decided to choose a place that I truly enjoyed, and will make sure to make it a yearly event. I will break this down by several different factors, and hope this review is helpful in deciding whether to go or not.  Décor: As you walk into FDC, it feels very upscale, with a nice bar on the left near the waiting area. The restaurant looks like you should be dressed up a little more than just casual, and technically you should, but some have gone in shorts and a tank top. There is a ton of seating, and the staff are all dressed for the Brazilian theme.  Food: OK THE FOOD IS AMAZING. I wish that could be all that is needed to state, but I will make sure to kinda explain what is really good. All the steak is perfectly seasoned, and is almost like butter melting in your mouth. The sausage is pretty good as well, and I sadly am not the biggest fan of the chicken here. I think it can be overcooked at times, but luckily you can ask the staff for a less cooked option. They also have an amazing cold food bar with fruit, salads, and other options.  Service: The servers are all amazing people. They ensure you have a wonderful time during your visit, and constantly ensure you get anything you need. You don't have to worry about waiting to flag down your server, they all work together, and the staff seems very happy.  Overall: I want to thank the staff at FDC, they have a lifelong customer as long as I can come down there. The food, service, and drinks will always have me coming back. If you want an amazing experience, with food to match, then please come enjoy yourself. Just please make sure you wear the appropriate attire for this place."}
{"text":"We've been going to Brazilian Steakhouses for many years.  While the food here was typical of Brazilian Steakhouses, what separates this restaurant is the service.    The manager came to our table early during dinner to see if there were specific menu items we wanted.  My 8 year old daughter was catered to.  They refilled the carmelized bananas three times for her.  While it's always pricey, we enjoyed our dinner and dining experience.  We will return!"}
{"text":"It's slowed down as of late, but I gotta thank my employment for letting me go to these networking shindigs.  Nothing like a few plates of free food to set the mood!  I will sit through countless meetings with salesmen slinging terms of 'cloud computing' and 'IPv6' in order to enjoy a great meal on the house!  Fogo de Chao was a great place to have one of these meetings.  The room was large and spacious, and was made private by room dividers.  Not to mention it's close to the airport which makes it great for those traveling in and out of town.  I'll cut straight to the chase...after fooling us into listening to their 'why you need our equipment' speech for 30 minutes, we finally hit the food!  Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil, and Via Brasil are all LV's better churrascarias.  Brazilian BBQ, baby!  All have excellent salad bars (which by the way have much more than salad), a number of excellent cuts of meat (and more meat...and even a bit more meat), and excellent desserts.  In my opinion, going to any one of these three places will do you well.  I think it just depends more on personal preference where you would like to go the most.  If you like lobster bisque and sushi (yes, sushi at a churrascaria), go to Texas de Brazil.  If you like lots of side dishes and some exotic meat offerings, go to Via Brasil (the chicken hearts are muy excellente).  If you really have no preference and just want to enjoy the meat-stravaganza, go to Fogo de Chao.  I really do like all 3 places, but I visit Texas and Via more because they both have e-clubs.  What does this mean?  BOGO dinner meals and special offers!  Yep, I'm still a cheapie.  Fogo de Chao starts you off with their yummy side dishes:  -Cheese bread (damn these are good warm) -Crispy polenta -Garlic mashed potatoes -Caramelized bananas -Rice and black beans (on request)  Along with this you get to peruse their salad bar which includes: -Aged parmesan and imported cheeses -Prosciutto -Hearts of Palm -Artichokes -Smoked salmon -Italian salami and ham -Asparagus -Tabbouleh  Fogo de Chao has over 15 cuts of meat as your disposal, here are a few I sampled that day:  -Picanha (top sirloin - love the garlic kick) -Alcatra (top sirloin cut popular in Brazil) -Fraldinha (bottom sirloin) -Cordeiro (lamb) -Frango (chicken) -Lombo (pork loin) -Linguica (sausage)  Meaty goodness I tell you!  I will say that many churrascarias heavily season their meats, so some cuts may come out a bit salty.  So drink your water people!  Or do like I did, get a can of imported Guarana drink, popular in Brazil!  Gotta love being comped!  Overall...damn I got meat wasted!  Everything was in fine order and my belly was full of sides, salad, and meat.  I liken it to a fancier Vegas buffet.  Food was great, and the service was top notch.  I wish I could do this for lunch every week!  But alas, the treadmill beckons.  And the countless hours of Insanity would have been wasted all on this beefy goodness.  I must not forget, our hosts let us order dessert as well!  Luckily we were able to take it to go.  I got me a slice of Turtle cheesecake for the road.  Unfortunately, I had to take that slice home...where I had to see my kids.  Upon which I told them where I had a free lunch that day, and watched the jealousy set in.  Therefore ending my day with my free cheesecake being devoured in it's entirety.  But not before I got a bite in!  Very rich but very good!  No matter which of the big three churrascarias you choose here in Vegas you can't go wrong.  Awesome food, awesome service, awesome experience.  Shimmy on down to Fogo de Chao if you have the chance and are honkering for a protein power hour.  But please, at least pretend to eat some salad!"}
{"text":"Obviously the unlimited meats are the draw, but for us tonight, the service was spot on.  Gilbert explained all of the options and the need to pace.  Once we were 'done', he went through the entire inventory to ensure we didn't miss anything.  He took the time to go and get us the bacon wrapped filets and bone in ribeye...quick, knowledgeable and friendly!  Thanks for the best steak and service in town."}
{"text":"I am a Fogo de Chao FAN!  I dine at the Flamingo road Restaurant AT LEAST once every 2 weeks.  Had a friend who is suffering from Cancer, wanting to celebrate his birthday.  At the last minute, he changed his mind from wanting \"fish\" to \"steak\", I said, \"I KNOW THE PERFECT PLACE!\"  Having never dined at the Summerlin location, I decided this would be the perfect chance...  Boy was I wrong. Sunday Night - 7 :15 PM - The place has no more than 9 tables of customers (NOT \"busy\") - We get seated and our waitress had \"attitude\".  She acted as if the LAST place she wanted to be, was in that building, let alone working...   Our table was missing the \"tongs\" used to take the meat.  I mentioned this to her.  She rolled her eyes and said, \"yeah, I'll get you some.\" And didn't. We had our salad bar (which was missing the soup, when I asked, the girl stocking the salad bar said, \"We ran out\"  I thought to myself, \"Sunday night, 7 PM - and they RAN OUT OF SOUP?\" ) Ok - we move forward...  The fact that the salad bar is not NEARLY as impressive as the Flamingo Location - it still had a nice selection... Finished Salads, no sides delivered yet?  We did get bread (same girl with attitude), I mention, \"Could we get our tongs?\"  She gave me a \"look\" and said, \"I said I will get them for you!\" (that was 20 minutes prior...)  I smiled and said, \"OK, thank you.\"  We finish our salads and flip our coasters to Green.  Here comes the first selection of meat.   The guy carving cuts down a slice and says, \"You must grab it with your tongs\" - I told him we had asked for tongs twice and didn't get any - HE rolled his eyes and said, \"I'll get you some\" - he goes and tells someone else - they grab tongs in a hurry -and suddenly, HERE COMES MS ATTITUDE with MORE tongs!  We now have four sets of tongs!  The meat service was \"meh\" - All but one meat server seemed to NOT want to be their also?!?  (I have a feeling they have management issues?!?)  Desert time!  My friend wants the Vanilla Ice Cream and they inform us \"sorry, we ran out - you can not order ANYTHING with vanilla ice cream - oh - and we ran out of the chocolate molten cake, too\"  Being a regular at the Flamingo Restaurant - who's Wait Staff, Management, AND Quality of food is FAR better than the Summerlin location - I will NEVER set foot into the Summerlin location again.    FLAMINGO ONLY FROM NOW ON!  My suggestion - MAKE THE DRiVE ACROSS TOWN - you won't be sorry! DO NOT GO TO THE SUMMERLIN LOCATION!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friend birthday dinner.. so first of all I don't eat red meat, there wasn't really a good other options except the salad bar for me to eat lol yay ... My friends did said that the meat was really good and got full by the end of the dinner."}
{"text":"Been to few locations. Never disappointed. Meat quality, salad, cheese ball bread, service are just great. It's one of our regular \" go to \" restaurant."}
{"text":"Fogo de chao I heard of this place from my mother in law. Which is amazing it's take what you get it. My favorite is the bacon wrapped filet, I have been picky with my 5 stars but this place deserves it, if they ever offer pineapple it will be complete... Make a reservation we waited 1 hour + on a Monday night"}
{"text":"Sooo great!! First visit to this location. Exceptional food, awesome service, my love made a classic first visitor mistake. He loaded up on the incredible market table. As usual the meats were incredible.!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We came for a birthday and were treated amazingly. everyone was super responsive. Lou and his entire staff were great. Amin stood out especially. He is definitely a stand out and treated us like family. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Fogo = No Go. Food quality is down.  Service is very rushed.  Had to ask for additional meats after being served a few on repeat.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I have been to several other places like this but Fogo is the best.  my wife took me there for lunch and we started with the fresh and tasty salad bar. I'm a carnivore but the salad was just too good not to try. I wanted more but I decided to save my hunger for the real star....meat. As soon as i flipped over the card from red to green the food started flowing. The first bite let me know just how great the rest of the meal was going to be. All the beef was so flavorful. The lamb selection was great too. The chicken leg was moist and tasty.   Service was great. They kept the mashed potatoes coming, the cheese bread was yummy, the fried bananas were perfect.  Finished the meal with the creme brulee/flan. Even though we were too full eat more, there was enough room for dessert.  They do a great job here and the meats were all delicious"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with a Brazilian steakhouse and I had a great time. The fresh salad/vegetable bar was very well stocked with a great variety of fruits, vegetables, and Brazilian favorites. The meat selection as they came around was very good, but I couldn't help thinking that I saw sirloin's much more often than the more tender rib selections. Lamb was a once a night occurence, so I walked away full, but thinking I missed out.on some of the better cuts that night. In addition, when we had been there just 45 minutes there was a clear message that it was time to go. I'm not used to that an a fairly expensive restaurant, especially when we're enjoying drinks, but they needed to cycle our table. Would I go back? I think I'll have to try another Brazilian steakhouse and see if I walk away feeling the same."}
{"text":"Ate there twice at lunch time and the service was great both times. J Robles served us at one time and he was very polite, attentive and funny. The steaks were flavorful and really quite filling for lunch. Definitely worth it esp with the discounted lunch price."}
{"text":"First time at FOGO and had a great experience. My wife and I celebrated her birthday as well as our 1st anniversary here and we're beyond pleased with the service. Our waiter Minh was on point, pleasant and made our time what it was.. awesome! The manager Chris made a point to stop at our table and check on us making sure we were enjoying our meal.  I recommend FOGO de CHAO for anyone who wants to have a great meal with awesome service."}
{"text":"Fogo me??  Fogo YOU!!  Now now.  Let's all Fogo de Chao.    This was my first Brazilian wax.  I mean... steakhouse.   Love the concept.  You sit at the table and wait for them to bring out all kinds of goodness (bacon-wrapped filet, sirloin, chicken, etc.).  If you likey, you take your tongs and grab a piece.  It's kind of like being at a strip club, though, where they shove a huge thing of meat in your face and... WHAT THE HELL AM I SAYING!!!!  Constant pressure to wave them off. \"I'm fine, thanks.  I just can't fit it all in my mouth.  It's way too big... and... and... nevermind.\"  A few tips before you go (and you should)...  1. Ignore the salad bar.  Focus on the prize. 2. Load up on the beef rib.  The other cuts are tasty, but you want the rib.  Trust me. 3. Drink lots of wine to block out all the debauchery 4. Unbutton your pants 5. Lose all inhibitions.  EAT THAT MEAT!  I need to go to church now."}
{"text":"Service mediocre for how many staff was present. Salad bar was eclectic and not necessarily in a good way. Meat was likely good for those who don't mind medium rare to rare. Molten cake appeared to be purchased elsewhere, like a Sara Lee cake. The atmosphere is like a Vegas buffet. The price does not equate to the experience or the quality of food."}
{"text":"Yeah it's a bit pricey.  $50 for dinner and $40 for a bottle of crappy white moscato.  You do have the opportunity to eat a lot of food.  I ate enough to hate myself and disgust my wife.  The service was fantastic.  We never waited for refills on drinks, for sides, or for the main entrees.  If our coaster was flipped, we almost always had a server at our table offering a beef, pork, chicken, or lamb entree.  It was fun with a group.  But, they couldn't quite figure out medium-rare filet mignon.  The meat was OK, not fantastic.  For the price, I would rather buy one very good steak elsewhere in the Valley."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff. We had a wonderful time. We will be back next time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I recommended this place to my dad and his wife and they have already returned twice since that cinco de mayo weekend!   He loves it.  I love that it is out of the tourist area and enjoyed by the local residents.    I highly recommend their limeade which has a surprisingly delicious condensed milk added to it!!!  Yum!!! Also they have so many meats and treats to choose from.   This place is a winner in our book!!"}
{"text":"Minh and Cameron provided us with great service. The Brazilian cheesy bread is always amazing, and all of the meat was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Salad bar has a wonderful variety of selections. Paired our meal with the Alamos Malbec, which went very well with all of the red meats that were served. Overall a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Great service and great quality of food . First time here, but definetly not the last ."}
{"text":"This is the fourth Fogo I have been to and it held up to the usual standard.  The service was excellent as usual.    The meat was great as always.  First round of ribs were great, the second and third were ok.  The lamb was a tad salty but good  The pork was ok.  The chicken and sausage was decent but those are never really that great at any of the locations."}
{"text":"They are lucky to get 2 stars from me.  Not sure why this place has such stellar reviews. I'll keep it simple.  1. No refills on drinks the entire dinner. 2. Only beef was good. Chicken, pork, riblets, and lamb were all dry as a bone. 3. The salad bar left a lot to be desired in my opinion. They had some good, unique choices and displays, but they should also offer traditional salad options.   We spent $50 each, had a reservation at 6pm and left at 645pm. That says something. You are much better off going to a real steakhouse like Mastro's City Hall or Ruth's Chris. At least their meats are worth the price."}
{"text":"I was forced to come here by my husband, but i forgot that this place offers a variety of food, from steak, big salad bar, and seafood choices. I end up eating a full salad plate and some steak. All really good! The Gauchos serving the steak are so nice and give great customer service.  The guys worked very well taking care of us, this is why I a gave this steakhouse a 5 star.  Great place for lunch or dinner, never disappoints."}
{"text":"I'm being generous to give 3 stars.  2.5 would be more accurate when I weigh the value of the experience against the price. The base charge per person was $53.  Add a couple of drinks, a dessert plus tip and the bill was close to $200 for two. For that,  one would expect a great meal, not just a good one.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.   The salad / anti-pasti bar was really good.  What you are really paying for is an opportunity to gorge on various meats. Most were good. None great. Some quite weak (briny chicken legs, ho hum lamb chops).  If I'm up for a $90 pp meal, I'm going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Disappearing servers, empty salad bar, cold pão de queijo (cheese bread), cheap quality meats and ill prepared meats are just a few of the serious problems that plague this location. The one by the Hughes Center is WAY better than this Downtown Summerlin location. I wondered why it was so easy to snag a reservation for 4 on a busy Friday night. I'm hoping that means the word is getting out about how crappy this location is!   I couldn't believe how empty the salad bar was! There was hardly anything available! Mostly just pieces of lettuce and fruit fanned out in a pitiful attempt to hide the fact that there were missing platters of food items. It's like they had the bare minimum that's required by the franchise. For shame!  The service was among some of the worst I have ever had anywhere. Our guy dropped off water, drinks and a few of the \"freebie\" side dishes and then disappeared, never to be seen again. Did he quit? Go out to smoke and get run over by a bus? Who knows. The meat gauchos weren't any better. While personable, it was like pulling teeth to get them to stop by our table. We had to BEG for some of the ribeye and filet -- and even then we were given slices so small that I COULD EAT IT IN ONE BITE. I understand those are expensive meats but when all you bring out of the kitchen is the chicken thighs and sausage, it starts to annoy me. This is NOT a cheap meal by any means but I felt like the restaurant was trying desperately to save as much money as possible -- at my expense.  The meats we did manage to get served were tough and either sorely undercooked or overcooked. The house sirloin was as tough as shoe leather. Nobody at our table could cut the dang thing and I chewed so much I thought I was going to have to go get a set of dentures afterwards. The \"house special\" ended up being spit into a napkin.   The freebie side dishes were an afterthought. Everybody loves those little cheesy puffs of deliciousness, the pão de queijo, but our small basket was super stingy (TWO for our table of four adults). Adding insult to injury, they were served cold and never replenished.   As I sit and write this review I get even more angry and upset about this entire dining experience. It was horrible. So bad that I have zero interest in ever setting foot in any Fogo de Chao again.  will never, ever go back to this location and I will shout from the rooftops to everyone I see so they won't spend their money at this disastrous restaurant."}
{"text":"So, we have eaten and enjoyed this restaurant many times. Went tonight with an out of town friend, and service was poor! Went at 5:00pm to hopefully get in early and leave before restaurant gets too busy.  First, we asked for mint jelly for lamb, I asked 3 times, 3 different people told me it was coming and finally 30 mins later it came. Well, my lamb was beyond cold and I had to waste that piece of lamb. Next hubby asked for beef rib and it finally came cold, on a small serving plate, rather than sliced off the bone. The beef was cold and yup, that took over and hour to get, he was full by that time. Sadly, he had asked about 5 times to get his cold beef ribs. Finally, the watermelon had been sitting at the  salad station for quite a while and really looked unappetizing and was warm. Usually when you ask for new food, they will bring you a personal plate with a few slices of watermelon. Nope not tonight. Was told that's the watermelon we have for tonight. WTH?  Fogo you can't afford to slice up a few fresh slices of watermelon. The finally assault to injury was we had a coupon for kids 12 and under to eat free with a paying adult. Yeah, I got an average sized kid, they had to come over and question his age. Did you need me to produce a birth certificate, Fogo!? Not happy, will not return to this location! Not a good experience!"}
{"text":"Ahh, I don't even know where to start with this restaurant. My friends and I came to Vegas to celebrate a birthday and she had one request, Brazilian steakhouse birthday dinner. We found this place and we were not disappointed. We were a little late for our reservation and all of the staff were so accommodating and friendly as soon as we arrived. Jose took such great care of us, explaining the menu, the different selections, how it worked as it was our first time and went out of his way to find our choices of meat when we hadn't gotten them yet. He and all of the staff were so attentive! Ugh, and the food. We tried everything and it was so amazing. Stand outs were the top sirloin, filet mignon, parmesan crusted pork loin and the lamb chops. It was all so delicious and we were so full. They knew we were celebrating a birthday and gave the birthday girl a complimentary dessert of her choice (there are a lot of desserts to choose from!) The staff made sure this was a night we would never forget and we cannot wait until the one back home in Washington opens, we'll be the first in line!  Our only confusion was this waiter who walked around with a huge shrimp cocktail but never did anything with...it didn't affect our night at all, but it was entertaining watching him walk around. Please explain."}
{"text":"Service and food was TOP NOTCH here! I have been to other Brazilian steakhouses before but none can compare to Fogo de Chao! The atmosphere and decor inside makes it a wonderful dining experience.    I came here last week for my first time with my bf thanks to the Yelp Elite Spring Break special of $37/ person. The salad bar had a good variety of salads, cold cut meats, cheeses, and dressing. But the fun didn't start until the meat started flowing in. We turned our paper signs to green to indicate that we were ready for our meat and the waiters did not hesitate in bringing over different types of meat for us to try right away. There were a total of 15 kinds of meat ranging from filet mignon to sausage links to bacon wrapped chicken. I think I tried about 9 of them and was stuffed pretty quickly. They also give you sides of garlic mashed potatoes, pão de queijo (warm cheese bread), crispy hot polenta and caramelized bananas. I tried not to fill up on the sides too much to make room for more meat. The servers and manager came by a couple times to make sure we were served all the meats we wanted to try and to made sure we had refills for our beverages.   Overall, my experience was wonderful. I will definitely be coming back here again in the future to satisfy my craving for Brazilian bbq!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the quality of their food. However, couldn't give 5 actual stars due to having to wait LITERALLY 30+ minutes for lamb chops. They really need to work on their speed with requests."}
{"text":"I had my Thanksgiving dinner here b/c M Buffet had a 5 hour wait .. good thing I did!  My bf never went to Texas de Brazil before so we just went recently and he thought it was good.. but I knew there was better .. and here it is!    The service here was GREAT, although I did knock off one star .. will explain later.  The servers knew the menu and offerings very well.  The salad bar was simple but very good, although some labels would have helped.  The meat selection was amazing, especially the filet, MUCH better than Texas de Brazil.    Now one star was taken off b/c it took about 20-25 minutes for us to get our check.  We asked a server for a dessert menu and instead he had a server recite the menu to us.  She was very knowledgeable of the dessert menu, which was great, but I couldn't remember everything she said, so she gave us a dessert menu and never came back.  Finally after waiting 20 minutes we flagged down a server to get our check and just skip dessert.  I think b/c they all work together and there's no designated server, no one knows to come back and check on tables.  I saw another review saying their sides were replaced promptly, which was not the case for us, as he replaced our sides after our plates were already taken.   But overall food and service was great, I'd still come back again and now I know what dessert I want to try without having to ask for the menu!"}
{"text":"Had 7 pm reservations, after waiting 30 minutes we went around the corner to McCormick & Schmicks where they seated us and took excellent care of us. I will not be going back to the steak house ever"}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of perfection that is all I can say, the waiters are always amazing you if you need anything, they are just amazing people and we love them. The food wow !! Salad bar galore ! The beef cuts wow!! Get the top sirloin and ribeye ! Nuff' said!  I LOVE YOU FOGOOOOOO!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed!! I've been to the Atlanta location several years ago and I really enjoyed it. However, I was really disappointed with our dining experience here in Scottsdale! The meat was very tough and everything just about tasted the same! My husband and I decided to go out for a much needed date night. We had 7:30 reservations and we were seated promptly! That was good. But once we were seated it took 10 minutes for someone to come and greet our table. Meanwhile, a party of four were seated after us and they were greeted right away! Finally, the server came over and did his bit but it was very lack-luster. Finally we got our drinks and went to the salad bar. I turned my card over and it took several minutes for the any of the Gauchos to make their way over to us. Once they showed up the meat was tough and burnt! Our bill was $165.00 with tip. Ugh! Now I don't mind paying top dollar for good food and service, but that was a bit ridiculous! I should have gone to Orange Sky instead! I rarely write bad reviews, but this place deserved it!"}
{"text":"Yelp, On April 30, 2015, you lost my trust.  The four star consensus indicated that I would have an enjoyable experience when dining at Fogo de Chao.  You lied.  It's going to take me awhile to get over this breach of trust, but I'm going to try to deal with this speed bump in our relationship.  After eating here, I am shocked that they manage to fill seats.  The restaurant is filthy.  The ambiance is best described as if Olive Garden and Chilis Too had a lovechild--which would be fine, if it wasn't $50/person.  I would have been happy to pay what the experience warranted--somewhere around $7.99 (excluding tax and drinks).  So to receive the bill (originally with extra drinks charged to our tab, which we asked them to correct) and pay $150 dollars for two adults who had one drink a piece, added insult to injury.  I would have rather lit $130.00 on fire, taken the other $20 and gone to Chick fil A and had a more enjoyable night.   More importantly, the quality of the food itself was deplorable.  Everything was dry.  For the parmesan crusted pork, they use the kind of parmesan that tastes like the scraps off the parmesan factory floor--the kind that doesn't have to be refrigerated, costs about $1.99 for one pound of it at the grocery store? Anyone know what I'm talking about?  The buffet was disgusting.  The food looked old.  The food tasted old.  I mentally prepared myself for food poisoning as I nibbled on a piece of cheese.   It was honestly one of the most bizarre dining experiences we've ever had.  My guest and I kept looking around the room in awe that this many people were paying 50 dollars/head for this quality of food and service.  We discussed leaving after sitting down and getting our drinks, but didn't pull the trigger.  We deeply regret our decision to stay.   I think one-star reviews should be given sparingly, reserved for when an establishment is truly deserving.  I tried to find one redeeming aspect of the whole night, and I couldn't.  I won't give two stars for a consistent one-star experience.  Go to Ruth's Chris. Go to Mastros. Hell, go to Applebees.  Just don't go here."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing Brazilian BBQ! The servers are constantly running to each table offering up a cut of their Brazilian BBQ that is fresh off the grill. The salad bar had a large variety of food as well. All the servers were very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Although you'll find some vegetarian options here, this is really a heaven for carnivores.  I've been to Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse a few times now, and it's been an onslaught of meat every time. Sure, they have options for Market Table only (basically a buffet of only their salad bar), Market Table plus a la carte meat, or sea bass, but you gotta bite the bullet, save the stomach space, and get the Full Churrasco Experience ($34.95 at weekday lunch, same meats as dinner).  With the complete option, you'll get that salad bar plus a prototypical churrascaria, where meat is grilled in the kitchen then brought to the table by employees and cut to customers' wishes. I probably didn't hold my ground on getting medium-rare / rare meats enough, but they should be able to find plenty of beautiful pink beef (and lamb) if you ask. Don't be afraid to say no to chicken or to flip the green marker (\"go\") to the red side (\"stop\") as a blanket pause (they'll keep checking back in case you go green again).  I recommend trying mostly everything, although I'll share my suggestions here:  - Pretty much everything with \"sirloin\" on it is a good bet. I haven't found the house special sirloin (aka picanha) to be the best, and this time it was a little oversalted, perhaps because some of my pieces both had the crust on them.  - Filet mignon is tender and pretty tasty, but I'd probably skip the bacon-wrapped filet mignon; although those medallions are juicy enough, they're gray all the way through. - Rib eye is good. - Leg of lamb is consistently more flavorful than lamb chops (rack of lamb), so as tender as the latter may be, skip them. Hopefully, today I've made this mistake for the last time. I got lamb chops and I actually didn't get the leg of lamb at all. - Pork items don't really stand out, except for the sweet pepper bacon at the salad bar. - On that note, don't be afraid to get sides like tomatoes, bell peppers, and mushrooms to go with your meats. And ask if they can bring chimichurri to your table. - The cheesy bread is still the best side (ask for more if necessary) that they bring to the table, although the fried polenta and mashed potatoes are also useful to help complement the meats. The caramelized banana seems like more of a dessert than anything.  - Not that I usually get dessert, but I've had them included free for one reason or another. The New York cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake, and flan are all serviceable but somewhat muted in flavor, especially if you're at the tail end of a steak smorgasbord. I'd pass on the flan because it's a little too thick for my taste. - I've also been able to try alcohol because that was covered (long story short, group/work functions). I didn't remember to ask which Cabernet Sauvignon they served, but it was really good and paired well with the meats. If you want sugar in your alcohol, the caipirinha is a great choice. I was glad that I finally tried this national cocktail of Brazil, a mixture of cachaca (liquor made from sugar cane), lime, and more sugar. It's sweet but not in that fruity way, and the alcohol is certainly there.  Fogo de Chão is a mecca of meat, and despite some inconsistencies in meat temperature and seasoning, I've consistently had better experiences here than at with the lackluster churrasco that I had years ago at the similar restaurant at Town Square. I might give that one a shot again, but this is the spot for me right now."}
{"text":"Best steak I have ever had in my life!  non-stop premium meats!  The Bacon wrapped filet minon was my FAVE (drool). Love the fresh salad bar too.   I Definitely recommend this place, but be prepared to spend a pretty penny especially if you are coming for dinner.  We try to hit this spot whenever we go to Vegas now so we can get away from the strip and have some good food with an upscale feel."}
{"text":"Great place.  Really great salad bar with asparagus, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, roasted garlic, cool weird red peppers, kale orange salad, jalapenos, oil & vinegar, etc.  The meats were great but I don't think we saw all the different types.  We had to ask our waitress to get some of the meats for us.  The waitress was really good and friendly.  I could do without the rolls or the mashed potatoes or the polenta.  Just bring me high quality stuff.  We wanted to go back every night during our long weekend stay.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Food was okay, not sure if worth the price. We came during lunch., a group of 8. The meat came out timely and in a steady manner , some good , some bad. We had to \"ask\" for mashed potatoes, and bread. For that reason alone, I'm shaving off three stars. We all ordered the full experience and those items should have been brought out timely and without prompting.total bill came to 329 before tip. In conclusion dining experience was just okay. The full experience is not worth the full price. In the future I will use my buying power elsewhere in a creative and proactive manner. That said, my team left engaged, bloated and poised to enter 2018 on the path to greatness."}
{"text":"Wow, this dinner was pretty spectacular. I've never had an experience quite like it.   So, you start with a lovely salad bar, they had butter lettuce (yessss) and a delicious basil dressing that went great with my tomato slices. There were also a variety of cheeses available and smoked salmon, yum!  Now lets get down to the meat. There was a Picanha (the prime part of the sirloin) which was gorgeous, Filet Mignon, Beef Ancho, Lombo (pork loin filets encrusted with parmesan cheese!), Frango chicken wrapped in bacon...yay, Linguica (slow-roasted pork sausages) and my favorite, Cordeiro, the leg of lamb, moist and delicious!  This is a great concept for a restaurant, I can't wait to bring my husband for his birthday!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and awesome service. Phil and Lou were very attentive as were all of the servers. Garlic sirloin, Parmasean pork and rib-eye were my favorites. For dessert, try the Tres Leche cake. Come hungry."}
{"text":"Had dinner for my 30th birthday here last night and I will definitely go beck for 3 reasons:   1. All the meat you can eat! Lamb, Steak, Chicken and sausage, etc. Plus unlimited sides! I am very happy with the selection and it was all cooked to my liking.  2. The manager came and checked on us like every 5 minutes to see if we loved our food.  3. Fast and friendly service...even though our party arrived like an hour late!  It is a great place for any occasion. There was a huge corporate party right next to us be we still got service in a timely manner."}
{"text":"The manager comes by two three times making sure your dinning experience is what it should be or he will fix it ASAP and will greet you as you leave he is on the ball, and Amanda I think maybe an assistant manager will snap her fingers to please ( not literally) but she'll get the job done you want an expresso bam u got expresso u want top prime cooked rare bam and anything else they offer so yeah service was excellent and the food well let's just say gluttony a sin we live in Las Vegas sin city I know I sinned last night truly a steak lovers paradise  thank you Fogo De Chao for a great evening"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  The restaurant is set up nice, very clean in appearance.  The entire staff, I mean EVERYONE, provided a great customer experience.  The salad bar was always stocked fresh and all the meats were cooked to perfection (variety-well done, medium rare, rare, etc).  Dinner could be considered high end, but for me it was worth it.  They do offer Lunch at a lower price point... I highly recommend this place and you can make reservations and it is highly suggested.  I don't normally give 5 stars, but this place earned it and deserves it"}
{"text":"Food was great and the meat kept coming. All the meats were delicious and perfectly cooked. The salad bar did not make sense to me as it seemed like a bunch of random stuff put out. Items at the salad bar tasted fresh so that was good but I still only made one trip. Nothing was good enough for seconds. All in all the meal was great and features a ton of meat. If you like very well seasoned and perfectly cooked meat this is your place. I don't know how anyone can leave here and not be on the verge of a food coma!"}
{"text":"I was here on Sunday with my boyfriend because one of our friends recommended this place.  It was our first time!  The decorations of the restaurant are terrific! Dimmed lights and low key.  Good place for a date!  Our servers were very attentive and the food was absolutely amazing!  Fresh meat, all kind of meats, the food came fast and was like one after another. I also loved the salad bar!  Everything looks and tasted so fresh!  The restaurant manager, Marco Moretti, even came and greeted us.  There was a little bit of discrepancy but he fixed the problem with smiles.  He was so nice!  It made our experience there very pleasant!    We would definitely be here again soon in the future and would recommend this place to our friends and family."}
{"text":"\"Reservations recommended\"...  i was thoroughly impressed with Fogo De Chao. For a place that is basically a buffet with servers bringing you meats to the table.. the operation is well executed. I am no stranger to this style of service as I grew up with a restaurant of this type nearby in California.   This particular situation was just great all around. Great service, nice salad bar with great items and condiments for your meal, and of course the never ending supply of meats hot from the kitchen.  Steaks, ribs, pork-chops, pork loin.. just a great selection. All perfectly cooked and served piping hot.   It is around $50 a person, but worth every dollar I believe. IF you get  a chance, I say give it a go! Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Awesome service which was very fast. Waitress kept checking up on us and the glasses never went empty. Highly recommended over Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"I love coming to fogo to get my meat fix on. Been here a few times and just recently figured out that lunch can be had for 30 vs 50 for dinner for all the exact same foods, but the only problem is that it's difficult to go back to work when you're fighting a food coma! If you've never been the red/green card controls whether the servers come around to give you meat or not.   Fogo has tons of cuts of beef, pork, lamb, and chicken! My favorites are the beef ribs that you usually have to request, the filet mignon/rib eye, and lamb chops. I usually skip the chicken and pork cause they are not always super tender and every time I've had the parmesan pork it's been a little tough.   The salad bar is well stocked as well with various cheeses and and cured meats and smoked salmon as well and provides a nice break from the meat. They also have a few hot items on the side such as the pao de queijo (cheesy bread) that is awesome and I really enjoy the caramelized bananas and polenta as well!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and utilized the discount with my Yelp Spring Break guide. Didn't realize this place has been in LV only since November of 2011.  This was my first time experiencing a Brazilian steakhouse. The inside was decorated upscale and inviting. The service was outstanding from the minute we arrived until we departed. The salad bar was decent but I was there for the MEAT! My faves were the Filet Mignon, Cordeiro (lamb chops & leg of lamb), Costela (Beef Ribs), Costela de Porco (Pork Ribs) and Linguica (Sausage). Sides included pão de queijo (warm cheese bread), crispy hot polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas. I went really light at the salad bar and sides just to over indulge on the protein. Love how the meat is served hot and carved  to your cooked  request.   No room for dessert but I really enjoyed Fogo De Chao and will certainly return to one of their many locations."}
{"text":"I really prefer this location over the downtown summerline location! Their service was good, the server was on top of taking away dirty plates and filling up your drinks!"}
{"text":"Second time going to the FDC at this location. First time the experience was perfect . But I don't know because it was very slow, the food wasn't that good. Some meat were way too salty and others had no salt at all. But the salad bar was good and the lady was on top of refilling and cleaning."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a group of 10 people on Wednesday. Food poisoning the next morning. Horrible experience. Their salad bar wasn't anything special. Texas de Brazil is definitely my to go for brazillian steakhouse! Two stars for great service!"}
{"text":"$50 per person, did not know it coming in to this place, but it was well worth it.  I left having a steak comma.  I will definately come back to this place when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"The best Brazilian steakhouse I have been to! The service was great. The food was amazing and they set us up for a large group with no reservation very quickly. We will be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"If you are reading this today is your lucky day! Truly. I am an on again off again food snob. Maybe reformed. But no.  Fifth time there, time to review. I'ts a simple format. Eat Meat! The dinig room at night is like a dance floor of waiters holding there meatsticks and offering it up to our hungry mouths. Ok, that looks like a porn intro.... but it's true. So for now call me Brandon St. Randy cause I want the meat they got. First off skip the salad bar please. This is a place to get your protein, nothing else. The slad bar has all kinds of frou frou hearts of palm, and aged romano. Sissy shit. Here at Fogo it's meat only. The house specialty here is the \"picahna\" and it is so good. It's like the best part of bacon fat on top of juicy sirloin. Make sure you get good slices wth a good amount of fat cap. Skip the chicken legs.....boring. All other cuts of meat are delicious. Do not pass on the Brazilian Limeonade!!! DO NOT! It is bottomless and so damn tasty, just needs a good rum in it.   Inexpensive for what you get. Make sure to turn your service card to OFF or there will be a dancing meat stick waiter on one of your elbow's.  They offer excellent sides. Caramlized Bananas, Grilled Polenta and you can ask your waiter for spicy dipping sauce, it is not on the menu or offered you need to ask. The varietes of meat include Top and Bottom Sirloin, Tenderloin, Pork and Beef Ribs, Chicken Drums, Lamb Chops and Chicken wrapped in Bacon. For me, it's only the Red's....Meat that is!"}
{"text":"We had our wedding dinner reception here, Saturday September 3rd. Dinner was great and the service was exceptional.  It came time to pay for dinner and our card was declined. My husband didn't think it would be an issue since we also paid for our Vegas wedding with the same card with no problems.  From the sounds of it, it happens often so if you plan on paying for a large party and you're from out of town it would be best to contact your bank prior.  We were there for what felt like forever and the staff was so kind and understanding to the situation, there was a gentleman that stood out the most, he checked on us frequently and offered drinks and coffee as we waited. He was even so kind to bring us fireball shots. His customer service was amazing! I wish I remembered his name...he was so empathetic and so kind. Though we wasted so much time there waiting for our bank and family to come to our rescue he made the experience great! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. They really set the bar. Food and service are amazing. Yes it's costly but you need to do it! Loved every bite!"}
{"text":"One of my top 5 places to go to celebrate those special occasions where at the end of the night everybody's craving's been satisfied...even my picky child. They've got so many meats to choose from and actually have the option to try them all!!! They also have a great salad bar."}
{"text":"First timer.   I'm about 3 months pregnant and have been craving red meat, so what's better than a Brazilian steak house?   1) On weekends make reservations early or you may be stuck waiting until 9pm or later.   2) It's not your typical salad bar. There are lots of artisan meats and cheeses. Lots of veggies zucchini, asparagus, mushrooms, etc... however perhaps I was preoccupied with the crowd but everything is ice cold. I'm not sure why I thought the steamed seasoned zucchini sitting in ice would be hot. I wasn't the biggest fan of eating cold cooked vegetables.   3) They provide mashed potatoes, fried bananas, some other sort of fried stick and bread. The potatoes were ok, but I think they're instant. Upon reading other reviews the fried sticks are polenta??  Not sure, was not explained to us by the server. Other reviewers also claim the bread is cheese bread, I did not taste cheese or see any presence of cheese, those were also ok.   4) The Meat. Ok, so my husband made it a point I try as much variety of meat possible. The bacon wrapped chicken was very dry, we didn't even finish it. The beef that was severed was cooked to my liking however the crust was very salty. You could still see the coarse salt crystals from their rub. The pork also very dry. My husband loved the lamb, I personally found it too gamey, but that is my personal preference.   5) I attempted to order the Creme Brûlée but was told by the server they frequently run out early almost every night. I opted for the papaya in cream. I read the description but thought the sauce drizzled over was some sort of condensed milk with the name having Creme in it. Turns out the Creme was a type of liquor, having a sensitive pregnancy I would have liked that to have been explained prior to drowning my dessert in this.    Overall my experience was ok. I'd prefer to stick to Vegas buffets for the price. I don't think I would return."}
{"text":"It just doesn't get much better! Hot, Fresh, Great Food, AWESOME Dining experience!!! All thumbs up! $50. all you can shovel in, the food just keeps comming, the service is GREAT! The salad bar....WoooHoooo, I'm Stoked! been there a lot, just wanted to take the time to let all the Yelpers know. I'll Be Back!"}
{"text":"I ate my weight in meat. The selection is great here as is the quality. They have a salad bar as well that is great (although I'd love it if we could have our salads tossed for us). The salad par has lettuce, around 6 or 7 dressings, great fresh Parmesan cheese, a selection of deli meats, and more! For the steaks, what didn't I try? Filet mignon, filet mignon with bacon, bottom sirloin, top sirloin, lamb chops, their house special, you name it, they had it! I call this \"fancy and expensive fast food\" because you can be eating high quality meat within minutes of sitting down! The servers always come around, but sometimes they come in waves which I do not like. Also, you feel kind of pressured to eat which can be seen as a downfall to some people. Overall, it is a great meal and a lot of fun! For a more intimate steak dinner at this price though, I'd be more likely to recommend Ruth Chris, Mastros, or Flemings."}
{"text":"What a fun experience! We have been to the location in Portland OR and thought it would be fun to take the family we were visiting in AZ to a nice dinner here. It did not disappoint, great wine selections, and the food was delicious! Only comment was that there were several times that our coasters were on green and we weren't being served for long stretches. But that was minor, and we had a great time!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was a great spot to go for lunch.  I spent $32 on the lunch, $4.50 for Brazilian limeade- totally worth the price, and then more on tax and gratuity.  I mostly wanted the salad bar but I did have lamb rack and lamb chops.  The meat was delicious!  I liked the variety of the salad bar and it wasn't all typical items you'd find at a salad bar.  There was very thinly sliced pineapple, very thinly sliced papaya, sun dried tomatoes, hearts of palm, bottoms of artichokes, apple salad, etc.  There were a few items I could not have being pregnant: smoked salmon and cured meats at the salad bar, and sausage that was being brought around by the servers.  Not to worry though because there were plenty of other options.  I don't know how often I would come back but it was definitely a fun place to try and the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly along with the manager. Beautiful restaurant. $50/per person.   The meats were not quality pieces of meat and were overcooked/and or tough. The meats weren't very hot and were cool to lukewarm. The meats were not flavored well either and the bread was slightly warm.  Not sure why the lady at the front desk said they were fully booked when at least half of the restaurant was empty?"}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times. Each time gives me a different experience.  Was there this week for a ladies dinner We love salt There is a lot of salt on the meats; this time wasn't as bad as other visits. You just need to be aware of the salt issue.  Service is good. We had a waiter that walked so close to us with a tray of ribs but we couldn't get him to come over. We asked other waiters to help but that didn't work. He eventually came around but.... Salad bar is fantastic.  Hearts of palm, lox, prosciutto, lovely dried meats and great cheeses.  These little cheese rolls that come gratis to your table are pure bliss.  Dessert was great. Creme brulee Good value for money"}
{"text":"My family went to celebrate early Mother's Day.  As soon as we're brought to our table, I must say that we were pretty much given an excellent service.  Our water is always refilled and they give you fresh plate every time.  Minh was one of the servers that gave us a little more attention than the others.  He was Superb!  When it comes to the food, the chicken leg was a little dry. One of the gauchos came with rib eye steak, I asked for a medium and he gave me well done, other than that, the experience was very good."}
{"text":"Wow!  That's all I can say.  Not sure what happened in the six months since our last visit, but the experience took a huge nosedive in terms of service and quality.  Granted, there was a 30-person private party in the back room, but there were also 40+ of us in the main dining room and we were absolutely starving.  Normally we are in and out in 1 hour.  This visit took 2.5 hours because the staff simply did not bring us food.   The food we did receive was either undercooked, or burnt to a crisp.  This was our first attendance at the new Saturday morning brunch, and it will definitely be our last!   To be honest, the quality and service has declined so much that we may never return to this location again!  PS:  when we returned home we became gravely ill and spent the next two days in misery.  Take that for what it is worth...."}
{"text":"Been here twice and disappointed both times.  The meat quality is not very good.  I expect better meats for $50+ a person.  I think the best meat was the chicken but i wasn't there for the chicken.  I prefer to drive further and go to Via Brazil Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Carnivores Unite...at Fogo de Chao.   This was such a fun experience. The salad bar is okay, but I would advise conserving room in your stomach for the delicious cheese puffs, the crispy polenta, the sweet fried bananas, and the tender, succulent meat offerings. Who needs greens? Not. Me.  We ordered up some Caipirinha, the Brazilian cocktail of choice at Fogo, whet our appetite with those light, airy cheese puffs, and then turned our coasters to green to let the parade of meat commence.   Everything was amazing, but my favorite was definitely the filet. I love my meat on the suuuuuuper rare side, and there were plenty of almost-mooing options to choose from. We definitely ate wayyyyyy too much, so exercise some self restraint, or be prepared to cancel whatever plans you had for later that evening."}
{"text":"My first time at a Brazilian Rodizio restaurant.  My family all enjoyed the variety of meats.  I enjoyed the pork ribs, beef ribs, lamb chops and riblets most.  Some meats are tastier and softer than others.  Noticed that all the meats are lightly seasoned so had to add salt and pepper.  Overall a good experience, might go back, but now that I've had it once I'm ready to move on."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was good, you open that huge door and walk into the place and it just feels like quality. It's high end and well styled. I had a few drinks in the bar with colleagues. The bar was small but nice. Service was very good. We then went back to a private room with two huge wooden sliding doors. This room was rectangular and very classy. We were given the low down on how the place works. Go and hit the salad bar first, be conservative and then come back to your table for an all out meat on a sword fest.  The salad bar was good. Everything was super fresh and high quality. So was the unlimited meat. It was all tasty. Salty from the seasonings and cooking preparation, but delicious. The house special sirloin is not to be missed, along with the filet and the leg of lamb. The sausages are forgettable, the bacon wrapped filet is so so. 90% of what I ate was delicious and I could have as much of it as I wanted. The other 10% was fair and I could stop after one bite and move on without feeling like I made a mistake."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst of the worst place I have ever visit. It is a combination of poor quality of food with very bad service. Literally we wait for 15-20 min to have some meat. I will never go there again.  Deserve negative stars"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm not a huge meat eater. At Brazilian Steakhouses, I gorge on the cheesy bread things, mashed potatoes and plantains (and, in Vegas, a pitcher of sangria). This the only Fogo de Chao location I've visited. I'm thrilled that they are open for lunch. I sometimes meet my hubby there (now, he IS a carnivore and makes up for me not eating much meat). It's not crowded, service and food selection are still great, and it's cheaper. Also, kids 5 and under are free. Unfortunately for them, my four year old eats everything. She's in heaven here.  I still think I prefer Texas de Brazil b/c their plantains and potatoes are better. But, Fogo de Chao has palenta. The salad bar area and meats are about equal.   I did notice that the meats are cooked more than some of the other Brazilian steakhouses. More medium-well. The bacon-wrapped filet was great!"}
{"text":"There is absolutely no better Brazilian steak house then Fogo to ciao! Prices are a little bit too high but it's so much worth it. Amazing meats and salad bar"}
{"text":"What an experience!  My second visit to a Brazilian style steakhouse (the first in Atlanta).  Had a large group of 15 people.  I wish they had given us a private room, but they did put tables together.  The food and service was top notch.  Spent about $100 per person including tip, but well worth it.  The beef ribs are the best!  A nice surprise was how good the coffee was."}
{"text":"Hope you're hungry, because I'm pretty sure everyone leaves this place STUFFED.   This  was my 1st visit to a Brazilian steakhouse. The salad bar was delicious. Not your ordinary salad bar. Delicious hearts of palm, cheese, prosciutto, peppers, etc.   The meat was delicious. My fave was the tenderloin. Tried lamb for the 1st time and that was good too. Just lots of meat. Lots. Yum.   Creme Brûlée was tasty. Huge serving. Split dessert by all means. I also had a traditional Brazilian cocktail but don't remember what it was called, but it was limey and sugary and delicious.    Really good place."}
{"text":"Tonight we introduced my in-laws to this restaurant. Since I live with a man who thinks this is carnivore heaven, dining at Fogo is quite the treat! What I love about Fogo is the service and variety. Something that was off this evening.   What was right was the amazing \"marketplace\".  The salad bar has a beautiful selection of salads, roasted veggies, cheeses and more!   What was also right is their Tres Leches cake for dessert.   What was missing was the service. Typically, the challenge is that there are so many meat offerings that you have to put out the red card to wave the servers away. However tonight there were times where we waited 10 minutes between offerings.  We asked staff members for help, and although nice, we still waited far too long between service.  We had to ask for clean plates where normally they were offered - what was normally a smooth operation was clearly off tonight. We watched servers move sound the room but completely ignore our table!    I still love their restaurant, but was disappointed tonight. Let's hope this was a fluke and they quickly return to stellar service."}
{"text":"Best steak house in Scottsdale AZ hands down!  They have the best lamb chops on the planet, that is practically all I eat when I go.  All of there meat is fantastic except for their pork ribs, stay away from those, sorry guys!  The salad bar is awesome with a lot of variety.  Marco was amazing and suggested I try their tres leches for dessert and it was one of the best things I have ever tasted.  Our service was fast and prompt.  I will go back time and time again, this place is the best!"}
{"text":"Great service everytime! Food is great! Very accommodating even when i was still 1 hr late to my reservations!"}
{"text":"Was very good food and friendly. Meats were very tender and seasoned great. Atmosphere was romantic but also fun if your not on a date. Not far from Baleys and strip so also good for when visiting town."}
{"text":"Hope you like meat, because that's really what it's all about here!  Leave your little coaster on green light, and let the feast begin!  Waiters bring out skewers of different choices of meat from sirloin, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, pork ribs, filet mignon, and parmesan crusted pork. Yes, there is a salad bar, of which i felt like I had to balance out my meal, but not the highlight.  All of the staff bringing out the skewers was overwhelming at first.  I was like can I finish chewing first before you bring out more????  But who was I to say no to more succulent cuts of beef, and ribs, and more beef!  My only \"beef\" hahaha, was that once the staff saw that our party of 12 was slowly putting out their red stop signs, they pretty much stopped entirely while there were a few of us carnivores that were still chowing down.  We had to ask for the filet mignon and the parmesean crusted pork, and even then they brought out one piece of the pork.  C'mon mannnnn!  Gimmee mo' meat! The staff handled our large group well, and even brought out a complimentary order of flan for the guest of honor, which was better than I was expecting since I'm not a big fan of flan.  I will be on the look out for more of Fogo de Chao and other Brazilian steakhouses when I'm on a meat binge."}
{"text":"Went here during 4th of July weekend - great place to dine!  The food/meat was AWESOME and José was THE BEST WAITER EVER!!!  We even got a first class tour of the kitchen (saw  how they cooked the delicious meat). Loved this place...great food, great service...memorable dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Great food & dining  experience! Everyone was very friendly & attentive. Our plates were always full & any request we had was met with postitive attitude by their awesome staff. Our main guy Minh was the absolute best, we had a table of 8 people & we all just loved him! The only problem is we all left the place way too full, which isn't a bad thing, just make sure you wear  stretch jeans before coming!"}
{"text":"I usually love buffet. I usually not eat lots of meat.  It is kind like a weird combo but when I finished my dinner at Fogo de Chao, I am satisfied - Meat and Buffet.  I grow up with breakfast buffet every times we went on our summer vacation. This made me LOVE buffet style; however, Fogo de Chao did not have the great buffet but it is enough to response my need.  Even though I came for lamp but their beef are the best. Different kinds of them fulfilled my craving for red meat. Also caramelized banana and desert (soft cake that soaked with condense milk) helped ease my sweet tooth.  Now I tried to think which occasion I should go back their again."}
{"text":"Love these places. I was at one before in Dallas years ago so it had been a while but it was as good as I remembered. Very good drinks, super salad bar but don't fill up on it too much! All the meats they bring were all very good. So were the fried plantains. Incredible service. Always there when you need them. Not there when you don't. Pricey but worth it for a special night out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you live gourmet and love meats this is the place to be. They have waiters who come around and serve you different types of meats from pork, chicken, filet mignon...its all u can eat! Including sides and salad bar. They also have this desert you can eat that breaks down the meats. Awesome place and totally worth it! Just be sure to come hungry!"}
{"text":"This is my 5th time here.  It only gets better and better.  We brought to friends that had never had the Fogo experience.  One is a real \"meat snob\".  Wow! Once again,  the staff outdid themselves.  We had the pleasure of being served and checked on by Junior again.  I was thrilled to see him at our table because he always gives us exception service.  And a smile to boot.   Everyone had a great time,  amazing food and spectacular service once again.  Fogo is the perfect treat."}
{"text":"Awesome sevice! Great date night spot. A little pricey but the meat was delicious! I was hoping it would be a little darker and more ethnic with fire and dimmer lighting but the setting was still nice. I guess they need to see your table is why! White table cloth open floor plan style. It was super crowded but it was a Saturday night so it was a little crazy when the meat started coming and everyone was seated so close to each other but once it died down it was very nice. They are very on top of service and getting you food quickly. Never had a moment where we needed much! All in all a great time with great food and an experience everyone should try once if not more! :)"}
{"text":"I have been to many churrascarias? in the US and Brasil. This was, by far, the biggest disappointment. Service was quite poor. We had to ask for plates to be removed, glasses to be refilled, etc. Lowest quality items on salad bar I have ever seen. They push the lowest quality cuts of meat harder than I have ever seen.  For $100 per person, there is no excuse for such poor service?."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant to go to when I am willing to pay a little extra for a meal. The customer service here is the best you will come across at any restaurant. You dont have just one waiter, no. You have like 6. And thats just for your drinks. The chefs come out with different meats constantly so you never have an empty plate. The food here is to die for. We come here for birthdays and holidays and are never disappointed. You pay a flat rate for your meals here and get more than your moneys worth. Lunch is about $15 cheaper and there is no difference between it and dinner. I recommend this place constantly to friends and co workers. Everyone should experience this place at least once in their lifetime."}
{"text":"I'm not much for AYCE but Fogo de Chão gets my vote.  It's a Brazilian steakhouse so you can't really go wrong unless you happen to be a vegetarian.  First of all, we got an awesome deal through Yelp Spring Break.  $37 per person instead of the normal $48 per person.  Win!  The salad bar is just that, vegetables, salads, some amazing burrata mozzarella, shaved parmesan, and sides.  I usually try not to fill up on those things but the burrata was delicious.  I tried most of the meats.  I didn't try the chicken.  I loved the house special Picanha, filet mignon, lamb, ribeye and pork.  So much meat.  Give me more!    I loved the chimichurri sauce they brought out.  We wanted a bucketful, it was so good.  The cheesy rolls were to die for.  I do recommend you trying those cheesy rolls though.  I love that they bring all the meat to you and slice it onto your plate.  If you need them to stop just flip your card from green to red.  Super simple.  Need them to bring more meat, then flip it back to green.  The servers are really conscientious about the colors and will even bring by any special meats that you request.  Some are circulated more than others so all you have to do is ask.  I have to say it ranks as one of the best meals I've ever had in Vegas without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you love good meat. It doesn't need a lot of marinades and seasoning when it is cooked like this. Not cheap but worth every penny. Staff is friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We received five-star service. Every worker we encountered was friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. I wish I could rate the food five stars. The beef ribs was our favorite meat. The Picanha, the signature steak, was tough and flavorless, as was the rib eye. The filet mignon was also flavorless. The leg of lamb and lamb chops were delicious, but all of the meats were over cooked, in my opinion. We were told that we could request the meats to be cooked to our specifications, but we were too full to eat any more. We were not offered filet mignon; we had to request it, and then wait, while it was cooked. The Market Table was a disappointment. I expected more offerings for the price. Maybe more fresh vegetables? My husband has been wanting to eat here for a while, as he heard good things. He was very disappointed with the food. The biggest disappointment was learning that the meats are cooked with gas, and not with wood, or charcoal. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Honestly, do yourself a favor while you are in Vegas and go Fago de Chao for a meal!  We went there for lunch on 7/11/12 and we were thrilled with the FRESHNESS and QUALITY of everything.  The salad bar was outstanding, so much to choose from and CLEAN!   After the salad bar, we were ready to try the meat selections, bacon wrapped filet, lamb chops, leg of lamb, sirloin, sausage, chicken, pork tenderloin......all of it flavorful, juicy, tender.  The service was impeccable, the meat  gaucho's  were always there ready to offer the next tasty morsel.  The meal was  about $25 a person, a BARGAIN by Las Vegas standards.   We were staying the THEHotel by Mandalay Bay, the cab ride over was about $15 soooooo worth it!  Our server told us the menu is the same for either lunch or dinner but lunch cost about half the price, reservations are recommended, so call before you go."}
{"text":"Hubby & I took the parents and two other couples here because Durants was booked (Saturday night). So, everyone was in the mood for meat- and I believe Fogo delivered. It took awhile to get the waiter to come around and explain the process to the 'newbies'-Drinks with the pao de queijo (warm cheese bread) was a delicious start.Salad bar was fine, but seemed the attendants were a bit slow to get the items refilled/replaced. After that, though- everyone was thrilled with the array of meats that flew off the skewers when the Gauchos came around- all the meat was fabulously done.  Some of our party ordered desert- but I favored the caramelized bananas . Everyone really enjoyed the experience, no doubt, we will all return."}
{"text":"the meat is not as salty as Texas de Brazil. salad bar wasn't as impressive tho. they don't have chicken heart which is one of my favorites. only the one in Summerlin seems to have it. anyway, came here for lunch. service is friend and nice. this place is pricey as you can expect. two lunches (each at $32) with two cappuccinos came to just below $100 with tip included. expense lunch I know but it was for an occasion."}
{"text":"Having had great and enjoyable experiences with Argentine, Chilean, Columbian and Brazilian-style steak houses, or as their better known as 'Parrilladas' or 'Churrasquerias' primarily on the east coast, we were somewhat saddened at Fogo de Chao Scottsdale despite its well established, branded background and fab reviews - I guess their national size may have a lot to do with it and/or it may have not been their best day!  If you're a meat lover as we are, you will definitely enjoy the incredible aromas which abound throughout the restaurant - beef, chicken, chorizo, pork, lamb... WOW!  Their assortment of meats at first glance is incredible, servers abound scurrying and maneuvering throughout every nook and cranny of the floor amongst patrons balancing their Brazilian Meat Skewers while cautiously slicing thin cuts of your preferred serving, while ensuring their baggy gaucho bombachas appear to almost fall from their wastes!  That was almost as far as both of our interests ended.  We were served all the expected accoutréments in their full Churrasco meat experience.  I must say, the caramelized bananas, Brazilian cheese bread, garlic mashed potatoes and many of the salad and side dishes were very good, yet the meats offered, to our amazement, left much to be desired of.  We found their meats, with the exception of the Lamb which was almost perfect as it could be and to a certain extent the ribeye, either overcooked or lacking flavor - especially the chicken which at each serving was dry and unsavory.  Plus, unless you speak up, your servings are going to be miniscule!  If you are looking for a crowded, cramped atmosphere and a 'not-so-authentic' Brazilian meat experience, this is for you - but if you are interested in just over-indulging into meats, then it's OK.  You may want to remember the prices do not match the value - at all!  We were expecting both a memorable and tasty experience, but were disheartened by getting neither!  Not the meat connoisseurs' nirvana one would wholeheartedly anticipate."}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE AMAZING FOOD amazing experience!  This was our first time here and it did not disappoint! We went on a Sunday afternoon with a party of 6 and was seated right away with no reservation. It did get busy though right after we were seated so I do recommend to call ahead of time and make a reservation .  They have these like circle cards that you turn around to green when you want the waiters to come around with meat and when you want them to stop just turn it over to red !   Their limeade is to die for! It's super fresh and taste like no other limeade I have tasted before .   They have all kinds of meet from chicken , filet , lamb , sausage everything ! And it's all you can eat too ! So come hungry! They also have a salad bar where they have potato salad chicken salad veggies fruit etc   Also if you want a fresh plate because all the meats are blending together just ask !    Definitely worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great too. I was pregnant at the time and everything was just amazing for me."}
{"text":"Amazing as Always!!! I love Fogo DE Chão it's always been a favorite!!  Staff is great, very attentio, good ambiance, food of course is soo good!!  Love this location in Summerlin!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Meat, the meat was better than Texas De Brazil  HOWEVER, The salad Bar, I'm not a fan, I would have to give Texas De the vote on that one. Nothing was labeled so I was unclear on what some of the things were.  The service was impeccable & everyone was very attentive! Overall, we had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"We've missed Fogo since we left Houston in 2003.  Back then the price was around $50 and now it is $42.50 - yaaay deflation!  The food and service were outstanding.  Our experience was different from John V's in that the meats were cooked at a variety of doneness and when my wife wanted something cooked a little more (does that make her unsophisticated? - yeah right) they were more than accommodating.   It's a meatstravaganza!!  Also, webmaster - Kerstin M. Deserves the first to Review."}
{"text":"One word...WOW!!  My sister and I were going to be in LV for my birthday and after looking at reviews for all the Brazilian Steakhouses there, she decided we were going to try Fogo.  We were definitely not disappointed!  We were warmly greeted by a woman (sorry, I didn't get her name) who seated us and proceeded to explain how the system works.  We knew we were in for a dining adventure!  For starters we had Brazilian limeades...they were fabulous!!  We were then greeted by the manager (Ricardo), he made us feel like family.  On to the salad bar, everything there was perfect to accompany the long list of beef, pork, and chicken choices.  My favorites were the grilled eggplant and asparagus.  Back at the table, we flipped over our service rounds to green (green for GO; orange for HOLD UP) and was immediately surrounded by several gentlemen all offering skewers of delectable delights.  When they are slicing, you are given tongs to receive your choice, so interactive!  After the first serving, we flipped our service rounds back over to orange and proceeded to enjoy our selections.  The woman who initially seated us, came by and asked us what else we wanted to try.  We asked for more beef and also the pork ribs, she immediately flagged down two servers to come to our table (and we didn't even have to flip our services rounds!).  Ricardo also came by again to ask us how it was going and to wish me a happy birthday!  Aside from mentioning my birthday while reserving my table through Open Table, we had not mentioned celebrating my birthday to anyone at the restaurant.  After another round of meat and another trip to the salad bar, we were done!  But not yet!  A server came by with a special birthday dessert...crème brulee topped with blueberries and strawberries with a separate plate with Happy Birthday written around the plate and a strawberry with a candle in it!  Ricardo came by again with a couple more Happy Birthday wishes, I felt so special!  It was an outstanding dining experience made all the more special by the great food and exceptional service!  If you're ever in LV and want to try the Brazilian Steakhouse, make a point for going to Fogo de Chao, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Anticipating going here for lunch on the last day (they give you the entire month) for my birthday promotion. We finally made it here yesterday, New Year's Eve lunch, the last day of 2015. I wanted to get here early so we spent a few minutes in the parking lot, not knowing we could've gone inside to wait. Nice long curved couch style seating along the wall (like window seating) facing the bar decorated with a large Christmas tree, complete with wrapped gifts, our little man was curious. We were seated shortly near the massive wine cellar feature (beautiful design).   The salad bar was amazing: chicken salad (raisin topping, very good, but went around the raisins), smoked salmon (loved it), caesar salad (ok), black beans, sausage & rice (loved it), giant asparagus (loved it), manchego cheese (mmm), artichoke (seasoned, not marinated), sun dried tomatoes (good), imported salami (delicious), peppers, proscuitto, bacon, croutons, potato salad (delicious, hubby's favorite), tebouli salad, sliced fruit (orange, ruby grapefruit- really good), marinated mushrooms, and much more (I didn't try everything).  Now for the main event: the meats that we tried. Bacon-wrapped chicken (delicious), beef flank steak (my favorite, seasoned perfectly, hubby said it wasn't flavorful, but I just noticed it was not as salty as tdb), sirloin (tender), filet mignon (hubby's favorite), rib eye steak (hubby got a huge piece, said it was his 2nd favorite), sausage (our boy's favorite meat of choice but hubby thought it was just ok). We passed on the lamb and pork. Chilean sea bass is ala carte.  As for the service, it was excellent. Everyone was quick to take our dirty plates away, bring us more side dishes, refill our drinks, check on our satisfaction, asked if there was anything we wanted to request meat-wise. We also got complimentary flan for my birthday (entire month to use it), which was beautifully presented, happy birthday written in chocolate, lighted candle, orchid, whipped cream. It was delicious. I really enjoyed it.  The lunch dining crowd grew as we were seated. The salad bar is towards the back, right of center. Overall, the main dining room (large square shape) was nice, very dimly lit (romantic ambiance), with soft jazz music playing; along the sides were alcoves for semi-private groups. The wine cellar feature (fishbowl effect) was gorgeous, I kept looking at it. The bar was to the right of the hostess station. The bathroom was clean and orderly."}
{"text":"#1395  I've been to the other one once or twice and to Texas De Brazil, many times, over the years. But this one is my favorite!!! The service is excellent! From the front door with the hostess and every server we encountered; everyone was checking on us, with regards to our overall dining experience, our meat preference, taking away dirty plates, giving us new ones, refilling our drinks, and getting side dishes- bananas, polenta (yummy!), mashed potatoes, bread (they all help each other out).   I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. The lobby is smaller than the other one (Flamingo/ Paradise), but there is a single soft bench for waiting customers. The bar is to the immediate right as you leave the lobby. I loved the beautiful wood (it is a caramel hue) that was carried out throughout the restaurant floor with the trees in the middle of the food stations. The same wood is used in the bathrooms (very elegant, clean, too). Unlike the other one, there is outdoor seating.    We had my birthday promotion to use (before it expired 12/22) on saturday (12/16/17- Side Bar/ quick shout-out to my mom who turned 81 on this day!) for lunch, so we (my husband, my son, and I) got here early. Not much of a crowd, maybe five other parties, besides us. Our little picky eater loves his meat. He kept saying yes, to everything meat-wise (sausage, chicken, pork, beef, salami, proscuitto, etc.) Hubby loved it. (I noticed after the 1st visit to Fogo, that the meat is not as salty as compared to TDB.) My favorite cut of meat, here was the bottom round, similar to Flank Steak (my fave at TDB). Hubby loved the Filet Mignon.   Here were my favorites from the salad bar: the croutons (these were so buttery, oh my gosh, they were excellent), the meat and potato hash, butternut squash soup, assorted cheeses, smoked salmon with capers (this was excellent!), asparagus, roasted peppers, dragon fruit (*had to ask what it was*), and mixed fruit (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and black berries). It is smaller than TDB, but the quality is excellent. I might be missing a few other things, but this is from memory.   For my birthday, we got to share a complimentary dessert, Tres Leches cake, and it was delicious!!!   (I prefer to come for lunch since we can walk around the shopping center a bit. I didn't overdo it. It's taken a few years, but I am applying the 80/20 rule. I don't like being overstuffed, so it's insurance, because I don't want to have a bad night.)   Also, there is Happy Hour promotions (bar only). We will come back, as we are big fans."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and had an amazing meal. I've been to a few Fogos before, but my best experience was here in Summerlin, mostly because of the relaxed atmosphere, the friendliness of the staff, and the excellent selection of meats for lunch. They brought out a lot of ribeye, which I wasn't expecting during lunch. The brunch cocktails were excellent as well.   Will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh... I'm soooo full! I was brought today for a work anniversary. What a great experience! The staff was on point the entire time, especially Minh, consistently checking in on us and making sure we were taken care of. The food, how can you go wrong with the all you can eat lunch. I tend to stick to steak, and every bite was outstanding. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The first thing you see when you go to a buffet are the plates. Seeing dirty plates instantly ruined my mood.  The salad bar is good- fruits, soup, veggies, smoked salmon, rice, etc. Having just the salad bar may be sufficient if you aren't big on meat.  Fogo has enough types of meat that I don't think I was served the same thing twice. My favorite was the bacon wrapped sirloin. Keep your coaster on green if you want to be served, flip it over to the red side if you need a short break to digest :)  The bathroom smelled like sewage and the staff were rude. I would have given 4 stars if it were just based on the meat.  Get the tres leches cake for dessert! Dessert costs extra :)"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. I would not bring the kids though and make sure you love seasoned meat. The salad bar is also great."}
{"text":"Currently I am shaking and sweating from all the meat. Do not, I repeat do not let that detract you from fogo de chao. The servers are fast, prompt and polite. The food is absolutely amazing. I even enjoyed the drinks here. I didn't know what I wanted, so I asked for something sweet and fruity. It was glorious."}
{"text":"I recently visited Arizona and really wanted to go to a brazillian steakhouse. Having gone to Fogo when it first opened, I really wanted to go again.  First, when we got there. We sat immediately. We also had meats en route to us not 30 seconds later. This was very nice.  Sadly, our drink orders were forgot about. Along with that, all the meats were very bland and were nothing special. 50 dollars a plate was about 35 dollars too much.   I have even been to the Fogo De Chao in Las Vegas. That restaurant was far superior to this one. I feel like they just don't care as much at this location."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed in the food here. Been wanting to try Fago de Chao for a while now since so many people talk about it. The meats were chewy and salty. Service was slow. Amazing \"salad bar\" which they call the Market Table. They also bring mashed potatoes, yucca and plantains to the table for sharing. Drinks and desserts are extra. But for $50 a person? No thanks. I'm usually weary of AYCE places but I thought Fago de Chao would be different. Spend your money on a good steak somewhere else."}
{"text":"Too much excellent food here. Would advise to come with an empty stomach as there were many meats to choose from. If you want to try a variety of meats without feeling stuffed soon, I recommend asking for smaller slices each time the staff visits your table."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The salad bar was nice and the service was great but  the food was just ok. The desert part was better I had the tres leches and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Tonight we ate dinner at Fogo De Chao in Scottsdale. My husbands & our kids first experience. My family was beyond impressed.  From Caiprihana's to beer to wine, it was excellent service. The unlimited food was amazing and top notch. The filet mignon, the best I have ever tasted! It is 5 star, all the way. For every table you have about 8-10 waiters and you are attended to at all times. All I can say is ease up on that salad bar, the second course is what you pay for. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This venue is one of the most enjoyable in Las Vegas. If you appreciate a wonderful atmosphere and a first class dining experience, you must experience a dinner here. Plan to relax, take your time, and thoroughly enjoy yourself and the fantastic selections from the huge salad bar to your personal choices of meats. Service is excellent, as are all foods presented to you. I live in Las Vegas and this is one of my favorite places to enjoy."}
{"text":"If you've never been to a Brazilian steak house before, you would love Fogo de Chao. Unlimited sirloin, salad, soup, and sides. The food was amazing!!! My favorites were the bottom sirloin and the filet mignon. Service was excellent. Never once had an empty glass on the table. Food runners were constantly bringing new, delicious food. My new favorite place for steak in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Good experience. Overpriced in my opinion. After trying a few things the novelty wore off. The desert was also overpriced and appeared to be store bought. If you go, make sure you get the filet which doesn't come around as often"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  I came there for lunch visiting Las Vegas on a Wednesday .  The hostess was very nice and helped us with the Eclub ($15 off lunch of regular $35 ) . We were one of the first there.  The salad bar was very fresh and offered many choices such as asparagus,  sun dried tomatoes,  fruit,  soup,  cheese,  and cold cuts. The  meat came fast and perfectly done.  The servers are very helpful especially Jose.  He even have us his card for future reservations. The gluten free bread was so yummy we took some for the road courtesy of Jose.  Upon leaving,  we are full but didn't fill like pigs compared to eating at places such as Wicked Spoon.  I will definitely come here again when I visit."}
{"text":"They have a very big selection of Brazilian food, the way the servers bring out the food to you is very interesting. The meat can be cooked to your preference. Will admit that it is pricey but you pay for what you get. Very good service, the waiters are attentive to their tables and guest. A good place to go for a special occasion since it is on the more expensive side. Definitely a good experience."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Of course the meats are to die for. My favorite is the ribeye and the sirloin. The salad bar has well-chosen cheeses, prosciutto, large asparagus, mushrooms, hearts of artichoke and palm, just to name a few, all contribute to that extraordinary dining experience. There are sliced tropical fruits! And the best, is the attention and service that you'll get. They make you feel special. I've always gone to the Flamingo branch. When I did my reservations, I realized they branched out to downtown Summerlin.  Experience is unbelievable, and the price, VERY WORTH IT!!"}
{"text":"Amazing cuts of meat! Great atmosphere, fun experience what's not to love?! The fillet mignon is superb. Even the salad bar has unique options . Perfect for groups or a date night ."}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant after spending $1300+  and quite disappointed. We were there with a party of 15 celebrating a birthday. The meat rounds were  great but the waitress lacked attention to our table. When we ordered the last round of drinks, one of the drinks brought to us was incorrect. The waitress didnt  offer to take it back to the bar to have it corrected so we just decided to keep it.  2 other drinks didn't have sugar on the rims of the glasses like described in the menu. When asked the waitress why, she said the bar had already dumped out the sugar since it was close to closing time. Really?? I'm sure with the amount of money paid to this restaurant they could've afforded to open up another sugar tray for our drinks. Guess not! 15 people and over a thousand dollars for this type of service, definitely not worth it. The food was amazing but the easiest part, the service, could have been at least decent. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Ate here on our first of 4 nights, 1 day stay here at the Wynn. Not to complain but if we are spending money on food, we just thought going to Fogo was going to be so much more worth it.  We were not disappointed, at all.  Beverly Hills crew can really follow the the leadership of the Vegas crew. Much slower, much more polite and definitely better price and the meat temps were HOT.  Also, much more seating.  Really over indulged but, as with any \"buffet\" style dining, this was expected.  Manager Mr. Pinto, was super gracious to us and told us to look him up the next time we are in town. Also, suggested the Downtown location rather than the Bev Hills location."}
{"text":"The place is lovely. They have their own driveway and valet. Great seats. I like the brea and dip they provide. The dip is a little similar to pesto but with vinegar. The Salad Bar is has a lot of choices. I enjoyed my cocktail which is Passionate Caipirinha (although Pampas Brazil makes their Caipirinha in front of you which is entertaining). The servers are really nice and helpful. The meats tastes perfect. There was a big group the same night I went and I had to line up for the salad bar. It was still a great experience."}
{"text":"Celebrated my sons' birthday here this past Saturday. There were 4 of us, I almost died when the check came.  I made a reservation but they seated us earlier than our time.... So what's the point of the reservation?! I requested they sing happy birthday to him when I booked the res online, they did not.This place is too noisy. I didn't like the way the tables were situated. My son kept getting bumped in to. The food was average, nothing to brag about. Highly overrated. The servers were attentive but you don't just have 1 so not sure how they kept track of everything. I gave 2 stars because the restroom was nice and there was an abundance of food.I am a food snob from NYC. Compared to my experience at Tucanos in Alberquerque, NM, there is no comparison. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Okay, people--listen up! Tonight we enjoyed the best meal, and by far the best service, we've had at any restaurant in Las Vegas. No one is even close! General Manager Evan Christopher has assembled a world-class staff here! Very highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The man friend and I came here for his birthday, and while we have dined at another location together before, I am always pleased with this restaurant. The service is so great and the waitstaff so kind. I am a pescatarian (hate saying that, i sound like a brat!) so while I do not indulge in the meat selection, I know my man friend is more than delighted about the selection and service. They walk around with plates of meat and you have a little card that you can say \"yes\" or \"no,\" so when you have enough meat on your plate you can just sit back and enjoy your selection.   Now for me, I got my fill at the \"salad\" bar. I use quotation marks because it is definitely not your typical salad bar. I was pleasantly pleased with smoked salmon, pasta salads, cheeses, delicious salad blends, soup, and many many vegetables. Additionally, when you do choose to get all of the meats, the salad bar is included as well.   It was his birthday, so they brought out a very delicious \"happy birthday\" caramel cheesecake. They also dedicated a couple of dollars off our bill! Overall, a really nice dining experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to dish out a couple of bucks for some delicious food."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner last week  here. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left we felt like we were the only patrons in the restaurant. The staff was 100% attentive, courteous, knowledgeable and patient when he came to us figuring out what options we wanted to eat. The \"salad bar\" was fantastic! My sister-in-law is a native of a Brazil and was thoroughly impressed as well! We will be back! This is a wonderful addition to Summerlin (and I'm a vegetarian!!!)"}
{"text":"Amazing quality of food ! Amazing service! This is the first time at this Brazilian steak house and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My experience here was great ! We had a reservation for 7pm and as soon as we sat down ,our server (one of many ) explained how it works. I loved the turn around cards .This is within minutes of getting there . The price is pricey but for the convenience of not waiting 45 mins to longer  to wait for your food like in a regular restaurant and amazing flavor in food . Well priced I'd say . I will return very soon again . I love the variety of meats and restaurants was beautiful inside and out."}
{"text":"When coming in for lunch the waiter explained the service perfectly. We ate off the salad bar and were very satisfied. When it came to the meat experience we were able to taste the amazing flavors of the country. My only compliant is that we asked to try a couple of the other meats that were listed and it took two or three tries before they came out with it. At one time we asked for more bananas four times before we were given more and then 5 plates came out! So their wait staff is a bit off on requests, beyond that it was superb!"}
{"text":"The Host server, Jason!!! He is the man!!! He made our visit welcoming and comfortable. He is probably the Best server I've ever had!! The food is always good!! Thanks Jason!!!"}
{"text":"Jose and his staff treated us so nicely during our dining experience at Fogo De Chao! All of the charcoal grilled meats were absolutely amazing and super fresh! Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Manager Joan is arrogant, pompous and deterring guests from visiting. I will never visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"took my wife and daughter her during spring training. both their first time being here. If you love meats you will love this place. make sure to come with a coupon. you will need it. We dont eat any of the salad bar, dont want to fill up on that crap. wait for the meat. sometimes you have to request the good meats or sometimes those come out last.. be patient.  not all the servers are the friendliest."}
{"text":"Amazing food selection. Pace yourself! Service is impeccable. I'm seriously loving this place"}
{"text":"After a friend and I tried the other Brazilian steakhouse in Peoria, I wanted to bring my husband to try it. We were near Scottsdale today so we tried FOGO. I have to say, what an experience! This place is fantastic! The salad bar way outshines the other steakhouse. The food was excellent and service great. There was a small hiccup with the sides that come with the meal. They apparently were forgotten. By the time they were brought to our table we were done with our meal and ready to leave. I spoke to the manager and we were more then happy with the outcome! I would definitely come back to this place and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"What says romance more than a medium rare filet mignon?? At Fogo de Chão you'll find more than just steaks, but a plethora of hardy meats, a fabulous salad bar and undivided service. And I forgot to mention, it's all you can eat!  I came on weekday to avoid the rush and try out their luncheon menu since I've dined at the other locations. I made reservations via Open Table and didn't know if it was necessary but glad I did because it was busy with casual and business eaters.  At the hostess table, I checked in and was promptly escorted to a table by the wall. The server asked if this was my first time because there is a certain way to order food. When the green coaster is flipped up, this notifies the gauchos (carvers) to come to your table with the meat(s). Each would carry a long skewer ready to cut you a slice by table-side.    Once seated, I ordered our drinks and made a mad dash to the Market Table (a.k.a. salad bar) which had a huge variety of cold vegetarian options, cheeses, smoked salmon, and on the side hot dishes included a butternut squash soup, freijoda (black beans with pork) and white rice. The soup was outstanding and my favorite veggies were the pear and endive salad, the roasted veggies, hearts of palm and the quinoa tabbouleh.  Now came the highlight... the meat! I won't bore you with all the succulent description but I'll highlight my favorite cuts in order:  Filet Mignon Garlic Steak Fraldinha (bottom sirloin) Cordeiro (lamb both the rack and meat cut)  Each one of these were juicy, well-seasoned and perfectly cooked to your preference. To get through all these proteins, I always requested the small cut so I could sample and come back to my favorites.  Just when you think you're done, they also serve family style side dishes of garlic mashed potatoes, caramelized fried bananas, fried polenta and those addicting pão de queijo (soft cheesy rolls). The servers kept an eye if I ever needed a refill which was a nice touch.  Who could think about dessert? All I thought about was flipping my coaster to red!  My only problem with this location was the lack of space between the tables. I had to maneuver around the chairs and carvers when we walked to/from the Market Table.   For lunch, I highly recommend ordering the \"Fogo Churrasco Experience\" ($33) where you can enjoy all the variety of meats and the Market Table.   Everything about this meal hit the spot and I look forward coming back again!"}
{"text":"Dear Fogo, I love your food and the service has always been great, with the exception of today's experience. In the first hour I was there I had to ask several times to get anyone at the table. I get it, you're all busy and it is lunch time, but it shouldn't have to come to me calling the manager over to get service at the table. Maybe it's because it was lunch time and we were sat in the middle of the dining room. So, for future reference, don't go for lunch, because you'll be ignored. I'm so disappointed, I wish it was better, I don't know if I'll be back, even for dinner. The experience has left a rather poor taste."}
{"text":"As Fogo's go, this one is not up to the service and food quality of the many others I've visited.  Meat was readily available at beginning, then went silent for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This was a weight lifters dream! I've never had so much protein in one meal! First of all the salad bar had the best salads. And the veggies were fresh. They even had asparagus on the salad bar. There was also some potatoes and rice on the buffett. The bread was really good and kept bringing it. Now the meat was great. They came over with about 4-5 different types of meat. I had to try it all. It was all pretty good. They also gave potatoes and fried banana or plantaina (sp). Will go back again if I ever go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Second time I have been.  The first time was Valentines Day, it was packed, the service was terrible so I just thought maybe it was a bad day. Second time we planned a family dinner with our daughter and her husband and our son.  Service was TERRIBLE.   First thing we get seated, and the hostess stands their holding our menus for about 5 minutes and says nothing to us, after a few minutes we are all sitting there like what is going on.... She finally speaks and says she is waiting for our server, finally our server gets there and the hostess gives the menus to our server for our server to hand them to us.   We order our drinks, 4 of us order drinks my daughter just wanted water, 4 of us got our drinks fast, the water took about 15 minutes longer to be served wtf? Meanwhile another server at another table drops a bowl of mashed potatoes all over the floor, some other person comes and tries to sweep them up, I nearly died laughing.  So the food is good.... The meat is excellent. It's all you can eat, they didn't come take our dishes when we were finished, I stacked a few in the empty spot and they sat there pretty much the whole meal. We order desert, we order desert all 5 of us.  They bring the desert out which is also delicious, but they put candles in 2 of the three birthday deserts sit them in front of us, we have no silverware for about 5 minutes, we figured they were going to come back and light the candles?!? We sat and waited purposely to see how long it took for people to even notice, we finally flagged someone down to bring us silverware. Anyhow the food is good, our bill was $348...if I'm going to spend that kind of money I expect excellent service.  We won't go back for a 3rd time."}
{"text":"5 star service. The steaks are amazing! Servers come by and slice a fresh portion for you whenever you want. The salad bar is great as well. Took us about 45 minutes to be seated since we had no reservation but it was well worth it. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, Great service...top notch in fact. The only thing that gets me is if you order a coke, it comes in an 8oz bottle and you pay for each one. That is kind of a bummer. Feels like they are trying to bleed you after you already are paying top dollar for great meats. Other than that, the filet is incredible and lamb chops are amazing! Do not fill up on the salad bar! As tempting as it may be, get your meat eating out of the way first."}
{"text":"Having been to a few of these Brazilian style meat-sweat dinners, I've come to love that you can eat at these places like an upscale caveman. Continuously arriving charred proteins are a thing of beauty but, it doesn't come cheap. And as great as it is to be able to leave in a paleo-induced coma, what really disappointed me here was the lack of attention to detail. The meal alone will set you back about $50/person before tip, drinks, wine, dessert, etc. Throwing all of that in, it is easy to run a tab closer to about $100/person. For that, I expect a little more than just a meat fest. My biggest gripe is that for a place that earns a large dollar amount per person, I would think they could put a little more thought into their wine program. The list comes in a heavy leather-bound cover which is promising until you open it and read mainly mainstream, easily recognized names and labels. Also, none of them have vintage dates next to the choices so you have no idea what year you could actually get. This results in anyone who is the least bit interested in vintages to have to ask the staff. In doing so, I found out that the staff really has no clue about wine and they had to go to the cellar to sequentially check each one. 2 of the labels I inquired about they did not even have any more of in stock. The 3rd choice I inquired about was a year that was horrendous. Each time I made an inquiry, the server disappeared for about 5-10 minutes to check on it so by the time I made my 4th inquiry, I was about 30 min into this process and ready to drink Chateau du Shit if that was all they could produce. The fact that they have fairly mainstream labels, they don't list vintage years, they don't seem to put a lot of training time into their wine program with their staff, and they don't seem to keep their lists up to date with what they do and do no have in stock make me really question their commitment to the wine aspect of the meal. In many places, this is not a huge deal to me but when you are spending about $100/person, I expect the entire meal experience including the wine to be pretty darn good. While the meat was plentiful and tasty, the wine program sucked and the tab was pricey which is why I can't go more than 2 stars for this visit. I'll go again because I like to take down animals en masse as much as the next person but next time I think I'm going to stick to water."}
{"text":"WOW what a place for meat eaters !!! This was my first time and the buffet was neat and clean, then here come the waiters with spits of different cuts of beef, chicken, lamb  that were so perfectly grilled. I must have eaten 12 lamb chops !!! The bill was $54, and well worth it. A must go to place....check it out."}
{"text":"Expensive, and worth every last penny! Compare it to other steakhouses (Capital Grill, City Hall, Durant's, etc) and you're spending less and still getting way more for your money. Where else are you going to be able to try 16 different cuts of steak, lamb, chicken, and pork at the simple flip of a coaster?   Don't overdo it on the salad bar, it's tempting, but save as much room as possible for the barrage of meat you're about to endure! My favorites are anything lamb,  the bacon wrapped filet, and the parmesan encrusted pork medallions!  They have a very impressive wine list and always have a few bottles on special at a deep discount!  And last but not least, the service is impeccable! Servers and hosts everywhere, ready to suit any needs, whether it's refreshing your wine glass, chasing down a particular meat for you, or preparing an amazing desert to surprise you for your anniversary (thanks again Thomas), these guys do it all!!"}
{"text":"Our family's favorite Brazilian bbq in AZ!   The service is always AMAZING and food is always sooooo good! It's hard to find a good restaurant with amazing service. A busy establishment like this one at that! We've seen even the General Manager wait on tables not on just one occasion but a few!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place but don't let that fool you. Me and my husband went for our anniversary dinner waitress was nice at first. Then the meat keep coming but after 20 minutes its stop and the waitress forget about you. I was really pissed was so hungry i didnt want the salad bar. I wanted the meat but was only good for 20 minutes even if my sign said green...horrible service and will not ever come back here."}
{"text":"Endless meats on skewers carved table side for you.Those familiar with this style of dinning know what I am talking about. For those of you who don't, you are missing out big time. First let me talk about the \"salad\" bar. I have gone there and not had a single vegetable (sorry mom). they have assortments of cured meats and cheeses. what a way to start  meal that contains your protein allotment for a month! The key to this place is to know when to give up. one does that bay flipping the little disc on your table from green to red. I have eaten so much I was physically and psychologically unable to flip my disc to red. I spent the next 24 hours with the meat sweats. I would do it again! Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Wow,  my husband and I have been wanting to try this place for 3 years and I'm so happy we did.  The atmosphere was gorgeous,  the staff was attentive and amazing,  and the food was phenomenal.  They even gave me my dessert free because the waitstaff found out it was my birthday.  This by far was the best dinner ever and I can't wait to go back...in about a year when I'm hungry again. Lol"}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Summerlin. Let me start with this. I had a $25 off coupon. Yes, you read that correctly. Allow me to explain. I have signed up on their email club. Allow me another deviation, you should sign up for any and every restaurant email you can, you get more freebees than you can shake a stick at, trust me I tried, I could not, in fact, shake that stick. Ok back to the business at hand. I love this place, everything was very fresh, the endless parade of meat almost stopped me in my tracks. The price is quite reasonable. So sign up, tune in, turn on...I think you get the picture. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Better come hungry... Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse will give you meat and more meat! It is a one of a kind experience that will leave you wanting more, but you'll be beyond stuff."}
{"text":"As always, a great experience at Fogo. The attentive staff really make the meal. They are always there to make sure you have everything you need and that you are enjoying your meal.   The buffet area is well stocked and spotless. The rotation of meats was varied and abundant. I like that the servers ask if you have any specific requests and they bring them out to you immediately.   Go for lunch, the price is a bit lower and the food is all the same.   Make sure to ask your server if they can call you a cab back to the strip when you're done because it'll be impossible to find one down here otherwise."}
{"text":"My first experience at a Brazilian restaurant was a hit. We were meeting friends there to begin our New Years Eve right. We had to valet, which was unnecessary. They had plenty of parking right out front. Seemed like their plan to get a few more dollars from you. There was no food menu. Everyone gets the same, which is fabulous. They serve each table with cheesy, soft, moist, golf ball sized breads. I absolutely loved them. I had to restrain myself. I could have filled up on them.  The salad bar was really good. Lots of great cheeses. They had crispy, thick bacon. My favorite part was the thinly sliced raw salmon. Each person has circular cardboard disc. Green on one side and red on the other. Green means you want meat and red means you don't. Some times it took a few minutes to get served, but most of the time they overwhelmed you with amazing meats. They had many selections. All fresh and cooked to perfection. They ask \"well, medium, or raw?\". Each skewer had all three temps. Everyone at my table liked the prime rib the best. I preferred the filet minion. I know I had too much. They raved about the chicken, but it paled in comparison to the meats. Ask for the Brazilian hot sauce. I cannot remember the name, but it looked like apple sauce. The mashed potatoes and bananas were served with the meat. It was good too.  The server was super friendly and really knew her stuff. She recommended desserts. She did not say that they were not included in the price. We tried the flan. None of us like flan all that much, but she did a great job recommending it. It was the best I ever had. Perfect texture: smooth and thick. The sauce was out of this world. It cost $8.50. I think the meal cost around $45. We split the cost among each other, which came to $75 each (included bottle of wine). I really enjoyed it and don't regret spending the money. However, there are so many great places in Vegas that are more affordable.  I would recommend this place to someone that has never tried Brazilian steakhouse and didn't mind splurging a little."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. Can't say I was enthused, but I tried a lot of the food anyway.  I'd have to agree with a lot of the reviews regarding the service. We waited a long time to ask for the bill, to receive the bill and to essentially get our cards back.  For the food -- it was okay. I have a few pieces that were inedible and found that there were only a few cuts of meat that were good (in my opinion anyway). We had the (I'm assuming) manager directing the guys who cut the meat to tables who complained about attentiveness to their demands including us, but once he intervened, the service picked up.  Okay experience and not worth the money. But my boyfriend enjoyed it, so it was good on that part."}
{"text":"Since I did not partake in the meats during my visit, I've recruited my boyfriend (who indulged in everything) to help with this review.   First off, as a person who does not eat red meat- you will not be left hungry after your visit. I really liked that the market bar had exotic selections and plentiful veggies. I only wish there were more salad options. I absolutely LOVED their cheese bread, pao de queijo, and could not stop myself from filling up on them. Other sides were brought to our table, such as fried polenta and plantains.   Now for the meats: Compliments: -Meat was always sliced hot and well-cooked  -Servers with sticks of meat were constantly making their rounds  -Easy to request what you wanted  Criticisms:  -Quality was alright. Good for trying lots of different meats, but if you want a quality piece, would go somewhere that offers an entrée of that specific cut."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Fogo de Chao and we really enjoyed it. We arrived hungry and that was a smart choice. The salad bar had a great selection. The service was fast, friendly, and helpful. It was a little confusing not having a designated server for our table. We weren't sure who to order a refill drink from, but we figured it out! All in all, I don't think I will go back to Fogo de Chao on a regular basis, but it is most likely going to be a once in a while treat for us!"}
{"text":"I love meat.  I love it.  I haven't been here in years and came for a friend's bday.  They have amazing meat, no doubt about it. Their lamb is perfection on a skewer.  If you are a vegetarian, don't even bother.  they do offer up sides and have a huge salad bar, but I skip that.  I come for the meat. It's a prepaid meal, so you can sit for hours and eat all the meat you want.    The decor is gorgeous.  The only downfall is the nonstop constant interruption.  Now, the waitstaff is attentive, no doubt.  But even without the green 'bring meat' card, we were constantly bombarded with people coming up to us. It was exhausting and hard to have a conversation.  STill a great place to go have amazing meat.  Do not eat all day and have AT it here."}
{"text":"Birthday lunch on Sun Dec 11. It  taken me this long to calm down enough to write this.  Made the rs online for 2 pm  Arrived and was taken to table by a sullen hostess.  Waiter threw up his hands and said \"what???  another xxxx table?\" As the mom of the 25 yo birthday guest, I spoke up and said \"we are outta here.\" Another waiter appeared and tried to save the situation. He claimed this was the first day for hours extended past 2 and apparently not everyone was onboard. Waiter 2 assured us all was well and he would personally take care of us. He won us over.  A manager type appeared and made a weird speech about customer service, but never making eye contact or smiling. in the meantime, Waiter # 2 bailed and waiter #3 showed to to announce the saladbar was closing. At this point it was about 245. Meat choices were  limited and cold. Clearly they were closing. We ordered dessert and coffee. Coffee was cold and stale. All disappointing.  Why take a reservation so close to closing?  Expensive.  Amateur.  Disrespectful."}
{"text":"My son wanted to have his birthday dinner here. It was such a great decision. They have a private room and it fit all 25 of us. The staff was great and kept the food coming. All the different proteins that they brought and the sides I just couldn't stop until I was rolled out of the building. Everyone loved it and we can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Went this weekend with a party of 6. Valentine's day weekend so I expected a crowd. It was very hard to get the waiters to come by with meat. Probably had 3 different types of beef, the rest were chicken breasts, legs, lamb, and sausages. We paid $50 a person for meat not fillers. Never saw filet mignon or the other better cuts of beef. Definitely left disappointed. Also took 3 tries to get the check right. Last year we got a GC to come back, this time nothing was offered."}
{"text":"I've tried various churrascaria restaurants throughout the our-- Las Vegas, Miami, Colorado Springs etc., so I am comparing FDC to them. The staff was friendly and outgoing, and  I felt welcomed. The food on the other hand, was okay. Sadly, It did not knock my socks off. I hoped for well flavored meat, and the meet served did not meet my expectations(left me looking for steak sauce). The buffet was well organized and offered great choices of sides. Moreover, the mash potatoes were tasty and helped the meat taste a little bit better. Dessert was pretty impressive, I had the cheesecake--it was rich and very flavorful--it had drizzled strawberry sauce, which complimented it well. This restaurant is okay, but way overpriced when compared to other Brazilian steakhouses."}
{"text":"Wow.  Cut back on the MSG.  I ate here last weekend and 2 days later I've barely recovered.  I experienced almost every single one of these symptoms after eating here..  According to the FDA, MSG Symptom Complex can involve symptoms such as:  Numbness Burning sensation Tingling Facial pressure or tightness Chest pain or difficulty breathing Headache Nausea Rapid heartbeat Drowsiness Weakness"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! 5 stars all the way! But Texas de Brazil is better if I was to choose for dinner option. Why? Texas the most amazing Salad Bar of any Buffet in Las Vegas with virtually the same meat. 14 cuts to be exact.  With that being said, the meat at Fogo is a hair tastier. Minus the hair in it. All the cuts here are very lightly seasoned as oppose to Texas which heavily salt their meat. I like my cuts medium-rare so lightly salted tastes better. Towards the end of the meal when I like it medium well, so the heavily salted-seared pieces are better. This only works with their Rib-eye here. In fact, I will only want to eat Rib-eye here. It's their best cut. And they sure give generous portions per cut.    So with a poor Salad bar and slightly tastier meat, why a 5 stars? The lunch time menu! Everything is the same for 50% off M-F. AMAZING! If this place was closer to me. I'd be here once a week!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell, massive amounts of tasty meat for as long as you can eat it. It's definitely a place you have to plan on eating in advance. If you come here on a whim, you'll never get your money's worth. Good for special days like anniversaries or birthdays, or anytime you need a red-meat overload meal. I'll be back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've eaten several times at many restaurants in this chain: Washington, D.C., Beverly Hills, San Diego  I have never had a negative experience until we ate at the Las Vegas one this past weekend. I made a reservation weeks in advance. It was my husbands birthday and we have four children, 8- 21 years of age. This is usually a great choice for us as a family when we travel. The LV location however gave us the worst possible seat in the place, despite me calling ahead TWICE to confirm a nice table for a special occasion. We sat right inside (like 6feet) the front door. Temperatures were in the 30s that night; a cold blast of air hit us and our food every few minutes the whole meal. I had coats later on top of the kids to keep them warm while they are. We asked for a different table. We were asked to go wait in the hostess area for two hours if we wanted a different seat. The salad bar was half empty of most choices- items were empty most of the evening. The meat was slow to arrive and stopped eventually even though we were displaying \"green\". Finally, my husbands birthday dessert arrived- despite the call ahead to inform them of his diabetes, they showed up with a high sugar dessert :/ In Vegas, you expect MORE service. This location sadly offered LESS."}
{"text":"My fiancée, son and I went here for dinner on Christmas Day. The food was good and the meat a little overdone, but well-seared and served hot. The servers were outstanding! but the atmosphere is lacking. The place was too brightly lit and the tables and chairs placed so close togather it reminded me of a big cafeteria. My adult son had been ill and only ate a fraction of what he normally would. He had quite a bit of food left on his plates, especially the meat, and could not finish. I knew it would get thrown in the garbage, so I explained his situation and requested if there was some way they could take it in the back and package it so he could enjoy it when he was feeling better. I realize that was probably against the rules, however, I was hoping for a little professional courtesy. At $53 each, the fact that his leftover food was going to be thrown out was upsetting. (He only ate a couple bites of meat and a small amount of the food on his \"sides\" plate~the least they could've done was offer to charge him the Market price, at $23 less.) Also, the price of a 6-oz. bottle of Coke was $3.50 and he had two before we thought to ask and were told no free refills on soft drinks. So the total for his meager meal without tax/tip was $60! Also, no one explained there was rice, mashed potatoes, bean soup, and other hot food on the back bar behind the salads/cold items. They did bring a dish of mashed potatoes to the table which I thought came from the kitchen, and we didn't discover the hot sides until we were leaving. Should we return again, I would just do the Market Place area. It had a decent selection of cold gourmet foods and I especially loved the cheeses, however, I would have liked to try the hot food also. Although other good buffets at the same price ($30) would also include all of the entrees, meats and desserts. If anyone could even handle dessert after trying to eat all the food that is offered, it is not included in the full meal price."}
{"text":"Filet mignon was the best followed by picanha, chicken etc. cheese bread is very good. Way too much food.  Chocolate kava cake and flan were pretty good. Not great. Kids 11 and 14 yr old girls were charged same price as adults. Really???"}
{"text":"Ok, I'll say this up front, I don't like chains.  There are just far too many awesome restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale to go to a chain.  That being said, this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal.  Yes, it \"seems\" expensive but once you've eaten here you'll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth.  So much awesome unlimited red meat.  Don't let them trick you with the salad bar!  It's killer but don't fill up!  And don't be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN, the sign of meat greed. hahahahaha.  Lastly, try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie, out of this world."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very energetic. The decor is nice but it has a little bit of a cafeteria feel because the salad bar is so prominent right when you come in and people are milling around the salad bar.  This is an all-you-can-eat place for 50 bucks. The salad bar is fabulous, I will say that. Tons of fresh selections and tons of variety as well. Not your normal salad bar. The salad bar could be your entire meal and a pretty good one at that.  This is a Brazilian steakhouse so you have people walking around carving pieces of steak for you. The steak was generally done to perfection depending upon how you like it but for some reason, at least half of it was very chewy. Even a bacon wrapped filet was chewy. The seasoning was quite good. A rib steak didn't come by until I was full and that's my favorite steak. I was a little disappointed at that.   The salad bar should not be the centerpiece of the meal. I expected more from the steak."}
{"text":"Honestly was a less then par experience but the service was so amazing they can't get less then 5 stars. They offer good meat selection, have good choices in salad bar but was not completely pleased with flavors of meat. When paying my bill, Lou Di Nolfi came and saw I didn't look completely satisfied. I explained I thought the service was excellent as was the wine but it didn't taste as good as meals id had before. He was awesome, he probably in that moment raised what would have been a 3 to a 5 star. I wish I had guys like him working for my company and it seemed the entire staff there was on point. He assured me maybe the kitchen had been slightly off and I believed him. Would recommend"}
{"text":"I know there is more to offer  The drawback of being a unique genre of restaurant is that you get compared to the only other one that people know.  There is a Brazillian Place in Portland and unfortunately in many ways it is superior to Fogo.   I love the sides.  The polenta is delicious as well as the potatoes.  No hot sides at the portland place.   The salad bar is huge and full on unique salads.  It's easy to fill up on the fresh mozzarella.  Good charcuterie too.    The cheese rolls are incredible.  I'd be tempted to order a drink and just pig out on the rolls.  Gotta same some room for the meat though.   My favorites would have to be.  Garlic Sirloin Bacon Wrapped filet Sausage Ribs.   A lot of the meats were just average.  Some of them dried out fast like the chicken breast and the filet.  The first round of filet was really unimpressive, but the second round was perfect.  We never got the pork one though.   Portland Brazil serves shrimp and grilled pineapple.  I missed these options greatly.    I guess if you know nothing different then this place is fantastic, but this place gets a four for me on unrealized potential."}
{"text":"This is a different twist to a regular steakhouse. The staff was very good and extremely fast and organized. The atmosphere was great. They carve meats right onto your plate from large metal skewers. Awesome flavor from the different meats. The salad bar was unique and different with cheeses and meats and a rather large selection. It's pricey but over all worth the money. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been 4 times in this location for lunch.   Loved everything but the Chicken. Chicken always tastes old.   My favorite is Garlic beef."}
{"text":"A must- first time here and I absolutely plan on returning-  As a huge red meat eater I've been eating nonstop for an hour-  Staff is amazing - choices are amazing-  I have to compliment the staff again they've been superb"}
{"text":"So much delicious food! Lots of variety. I like that you can mix up your meats instead of committing to one. Friendly waiters. They were very attentive and polite. Was recommended to me as a romantic place for dinner, but I wouldn't say that. We had one issue with getting multiple checks because you have many different waiters (only thing I didn't like), but they made things right without us even complaining. I really appreciated that. I definitely will be back here again!"}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao never disappoints. They take care of you from the minute you walk into the door. Management is extremely professional. Me and my girlfriend have been to the LA locations multiple times and the quality is the same no matter where you go. Valdemir Machado the General manager even stopped at our table, chatted and gave my girlfriend a free cheesecake for her birthday. Our wait staff was amazing and attentive. You can tell the company takes care of its employees because they show that to their customers in return. The food is soooooooooooooo good. You cant beat getting top notch meat cuts cooked to perfection for only 50 dollars. Will come back soon"}
{"text":"This is our first time here. The restaurant is beautiful and the aroma of the meet when you walk in is just intoxicating. We  were \"greeted\" by some unfriendly hostesses so I  was slightly taken back by that considering they set the tone for the initial experience here. Let's get to the amazing part. The salad bar was just spectacular. Everything was fresh and unique. The bread at the table was amazing. I'm a bit of an iced tea snob and their tea was very good. Then here comes some of the best seasoned meat that were all cooked to perfection. I don't know how we did it but we had dessert and the papaya cream was unbelievable. We left so unbelievably full but very happy. The meal was a bit on the pricey side but worth it food wise. You definitely should give this place a try ; hopefully they'll have some new hostesses with a little class and better personalities.   I would've given Fago 5 stars but I feel that for the price I paid the customer service should've been so much better.  :("}
{"text":"We had the best experience here... the food was amazing, the atmosphere was cozy and pleasant, the service was outstanding. Juliano waited on us and made our experience extra special. The manager was also attentive and has put together a great team. The meat was all cooked to perfection. The buffet was fresh and delicious. We will be back. Total dining experience!"}
{"text":"Ample amounts of amazing meats!   The service was spectacular as if they almost foreshadow I'm your needs.  The orchestration of shared responsibilities to keep the table well attendees was effortless and impressive."}
{"text":"Nvr been to fogo de chao, but this won't be the last. And I will only come back to the Las Vegas one! Steven our waiter was just too amazing so I'll only give my money to this location. Yeah that's his fault. He checked on us just enough but not where it was annoying. Then he surprised us was an extra mile of service. Great place in LV!"}
{"text":"We had my sister's graduation dinner here and if you like meat, a top notch salad bar, and now even a stellar fish dish. Fogo de Chao won't disappoint. We had a huge party of people and they did a stellar job serving us. It's a place where it's all you can eat and you simply keep getting served until you flip over your card to red or pop from eating so much. The salad bar is one of the best ones I've seen. They had kale salad, pickled tomatoes, a couple good cheeses, and the whole assortment. A vegetarian will not have any issues with finding something to eat even if it is a Brazilian steakhouse.  They also have good desserts and beverages as well as a good dessert drink menu. If you're there to eat meat, only eat a small bit of salad or none at all. They serve a delicious bread before and during, as well a few sides that come out with the meat. Mashed potatoes, fried corn bread type things, and fried plantains. We had a great experience, the servers were attentive and took care of us well."}
{"text":"Came here with a 5 o'clock reservation for the first time yesterday to celebrate my wife's birthday, Hostess was kinda odd and we felt like we were rushed to decide which \"experience\" we wanted, weird vibe already?  Our Waitress didn't seem very courteous at all, but doing the \"have you dined with us before?\" with no emotion routine was getting even better. She even left us without saying anything about half way thru our meal, yes we both kept looking around to get refills on anything, I believe a \"manager\" even noticed us and had another waitress to start attending to us.   We always judge the food first, service second obviously because that's what you're there for, the food.   The salad bar was very skimpy with a \"small\" selection and looked like it's from any one of the cheapest buffet you can find from any casino buffet, not impressive at all. Some items with no description, there are no excuse for that at all. The spicy bacon with red pepper chips was a surprise and not in pleasant way, but in a wholly crap, is this red pepper chips on my bacon too spicy hot rude kinda way! :( haha   Now for the meats: The \"House\" picahna was at first the most tasty, followed by the beef ribs, the pork chops, flank steak, filet mignon, then bacon wrapped chicken, chicken. The Rib eye, pork ribs, wasn't good at all at any point. What I mean at any point is after requesting the other meats, both me and my wife we're noticing the inconsistency of the meats themselves? I guess you can say maybe it's different \"cooks\" back there, sorry I can't say \"Chefs\" because they would never be that inconsistent but hey they should come out pretty close to being consistent in texture at the least? All in all the meats were just average in both flavor and seasoning, more bland than anything. Nothing like a good steak house at all.   Service from the Gauchos was pretty consistent except for the bigger/tallest gentleman that after being there half an hour started to put his blinders on and kept passing by our table, yes with both our \"GREEN\" ticket passes \"ON\", we both noticed you buddy! Haha, you even hired someone from the \"other\" Brazilian style restaurant.   First off, I'm sure you're probably the most expensive restaurant in a Downtown Summerlin's restaurant row by far, act like it! You've even got the concept wrong or management wrong, because the whole \"EXPERIENCE\" just did not come close to half of what you get from \"TEXAS DE BRAZIL\", yes I said it, and I hate to compare, but you just don't. Maybe it was an off time and day (Saturday @ 5) or maybe it was the staff and shift, but something is lacking a lot and I sure do not recommend it because you should be busy and rocking like all your neighboring restaurants right next to you!  If you've ever dined at other \"Brazilian Steakhouses\", you would know that TEXAS DE BRAZIL sets the standards for all and is the \"PREMIER\" Brazilian Steakhouse.  Birthday dessert was a pleasant surprise at the end, that's where your second star came from. All in all a very high priced dining experience that with a little help could be what everyone would expect, good off the strip restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and this is my favorite restaurant.  Best salad bar in the world and amazing service. I'm used to the swanky Philly location.  Las Vegas was a bit more \"down to earth\" (go figure) but the service was just as spectacular.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"South Brazilian BBQ. Meat was perfectly cooked and the farmers market table was delicious.  Will definitely be back. Wine selection was good but a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Meat.  A whole lot of meat.  Is there really anything else I need to say?  Vegetarians and vegans may just want to skip this restaurant.  For those unfamiliar with the concept.  Fogo de Chao is like a buffet that comes to you.  For about $50, servers on carts move about the restaurant and will serve you a cut of whatever they are carrying.  It's not the best or most seasoned cuts you will ever consume, but you will not leave dissatisfied or hungry.  There is also a pretty big \"salad bar\" that will get some greens and starches on your plate, but it's really not all that great.  Fogo also caters well to bigger groups.  My party of 15 had no problem being promptly seated (with some arriving well before our reservation) and served.  I highly recommend dining at Fogo with a group of carnivores when you have something to celebrate."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with their summer feast promotion. When we entered around 6:30ish we were surprised that only two other tables were occupied.  While the staff is very nice and accommodating, the food just was not good. Firstly, the salad bar area does not hold a candle to Texas De Brazil.  There is just not much variety. Now for the meats. Salty beyond belief, extremely fatty, sliced toilet paper thin.  Just not good. The polenta that came as a side was hard as a rock and dry as a bone. Frankly I would not  have liked this if it was free let alone almost $100.00 for two. Sorry Fogo, will not come back. If u guys don't do some quality control or at the very least if the manager does not do a walk around and ask if everything is ok, I do not see your business picking up anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went to lunch there for the first time and the food was amazing.  They have an amazing salad bar, but this is the place for meat lovers.  I highly recommend the leg of lamb, parmesan pork, and the sausage.  Lovely atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"We have been to several Brazilian steakhouses. This was our first time to this location. THE Fdc was in downtown Chicago and it was amazing. . The second best was Indianapolis.          The service was very good here ... the polenta sticks and cheese rolls were good. Unfortunately the meat was the worst of the 4 Fogo de chaos. Kept asking for medium and getting rare ... alot was fatty or tough. Very disappointed for the cost."}
{"text":"Last night a good friend of mine took me to Fogo de Chao for dinner to celebrate my birthday. I had heard of Fogo de Chao but had never been. I can't believe what I had been missing!  Not only was the food incredible (The varieties of Brazilian meats were all delicious!), but the staff was top-notch. Ricardo was our waiter, and he was such a nice guy and provided excellent service.   The staff surprised me for my birthday by presenting me with their papaya cream topped with liqueur, and it was delicious!  I had a wonderful time, and it was some of the best food I've ever tasted...Amazing first experience...and now it's one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"My new favorite dining spot! Such a fun place to eat. The quality of food was so good. It was excellent actually. The cocktails are good. They even gave me a Mother's Day gift card. How lovely!!! I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I went here recently with a medium sized group for a bachelor party dinner.  We arrived right at 6 pm for our reservations and were seated immediately.  We were given the rundown on how everything works, and then were unleashed.    My first stop was the salad.  I came in with a plan, go easy on the salad part to leave room for the good stuff (meat) and get some salad fixin's to at least make it seem like it is a somewhat balanced meal.  Overall, I have to say I was pretty disappointed with the salad bar.  The only things that I were really impressed with was the fresh cheeses (fresh mozzarella balls especially).  I guess the pesto salad dressing was nice but most of it was just average for me.    Finished the salad plate, and flipped the red/green card to go.  (Note:  I'm not sure how efficient this system was, there were times when I was green and the gaucho's passed me by, and times where I was red when they asked how I liked my cut).   All of the sudden it was a whirlwind of skewer toting gaucho's, asking if you'd like some of their meat (hmm...that sounds more like a description for a bachelorette party?).  I tried countless different cuts of meats, top sirloin, filet, chicken leg, lamb, etc.  My least favorites were the lamb (did not like the flavor, I usually really like lamb) and garlic meat (can't remember the cut offhand) which was a little overpowering with the garlic (and I like garlic).  The best were the filet mignon and the rib eye.  The other meats I had were also very good.  We were also served some cheesy bread rolls and a trio of sides, garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and fried plaintains.  I did not try the plantains, but the garlic mashed were uninspired at best (and opposite of the meat had little to no garlic flavor) but the polenta was fantastic.  I had at least three of those suckers.    Service was mostly good.  One problem with the meat service is that you get hit with 5-7 different meats in rapid succession, then you don't see another server for a bit.  Kind of feast of famine...  Also, we had one person order an after dinner coffee that wasn't deliver and an error on the check.  I additionally thought that the layout of the restaurant wasn't great, when it was crowded when we left it was pretty hard making it through all the tables when they were full and you had tons of employees running around.  I liked it.  I would definitely go back to a brazilian style steakhouse again, though if I went to Fogo, I might go for lunch (starting Oct 1) and save about $20 bucks."}
{"text":"Our service was impeccable everything was great.  The food is so good and tasted great . CHRISTOPHER was so friendly.   All the staff was great .  New guy Steve kept checking in on us. Great guy . My only complaint would be that it was so damn bright in the room dim the lights maybe even toss a small candle on the table and save a few bucks on your energy bill it would really help out."}
{"text":"Dined at Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse Friday night for dinner and it was very tasty.  So much food and fun!  This was our first time at Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse, and we weren't really sure what to expect.  The best was I can describe it is a \"meat parade\".  There are so many different kinds of meat to choose from, and the market table...WOW!  We also enjoyed dessert even though we were stuffed...lol!  Looking forward to a return visit again soon."}
{"text":"The steaks here will melt in your mouth.  The salad bar is amazing I strongly recommend this place for special occasions they will not disappoint.  Prices were steep but worth every dollar.  All you can eat steak house Brazilian style."}
{"text":"What is the one thing better than going to Fogo? Going to Fogo and someone else is paying!  Yeah Baby!  As per the usual with Fogo you can get almost any meat you want. I can cook most any meat they bring and usually do, except one. Lamb! I love lamb, but that tend to cost more than I like so I don't cook it at home. Fogo however, will bring me lamb chops until I explode. Thin mint anyone? I asked one of they waiter to send my the lamb and only the lamb. They must not get many requests for lamb chops because they had to cook some. After a short wait they had a skewer ready to go. And then another skewer and another. I was in lamb chop heaven. I think I ate a whole lamb. Sorry Shari Lewis. Oh and they brought out mint jelly.   Lamb Chops, that's why I love Fogo!"}
{"text":"Very much like Texas de Brazil. The service is better, the meat is better, the salad bar is smaller and lacks some of my favorites from Texas de Brazil. That being said, Fogo's service and meat quality makes it my top Brazilian BBQ spot in town. Also, their cheesy bread balls are the best I've ever had, I think I ate 6 of them. This is where service comes into play, I never once had to ask for more bread or fried bananas, in fact, often these items were refreshed before we were even done with the previous order."}
{"text":"Great salad bar and an extensive selection of grilled meats served on skewers give this place a well deserved 4 star rating.  Service is pretty good too.  Although I would have to say the meats, while decent, at least to me were a tad on the tough side, maybe USDA choice quality, but not definitely not USDA prime.  But overall, a pretty good dining experience."}
{"text":"If you ever feel hungry and tired or same kind of food, this place is for you. Start with an amazing salad collection filled with any type of cheese and amazing dressings. Don't get fill up with that save extra room for the unlimited, all you can eat meat that will change your life with every bite. I  Love the food and the service."}
{"text":"Love the place! Expensive but Good food! Drinks are expensive and all full of ice! Service was great."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinner!  Having been to 2 other churrascarias, Fogo De Chao was clearly the best out of the 3.  Not only was the food better than the other places, the service was excellent as well.  I started with a caipirinha which was very strong, but tasty.  Shortly after that, the meat starting coming.  Each cut was nice, hot, and juicy.  The servers constantly asked us if we had any special cuts that we wanted/wanted more of.  Things were so fast and furious that I was pretty full after 15 minutes.  I was determined to eat a good amount so I kept at it for another 20 minutes.  After that I was pretty much TKO on meat so I sat and thought hard about any specific cuts I really wanted to try again.  I had 1-2 more pieces and was done.  It's worth mentioning that the sides/salad bar were very good as well.  It's a nice break from all the meat.  It's not a every week type of place but once in awhile it's definitely a nice treat when you're craving some delicious meat.  It's worth a short drive off the strip!"}
{"text":"If you have never experienced Brazilian style eating THIS IS THE PLACE. even if you have ITS A MUST IN LAS VEGAS.   great food great service and lots of BACON  BACON damn it how can it not be great with lots of BACON !!  BTW Try the BACON"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Great salad bar. Overall good experience. Like open table reservation.. Three stars for the service."}
{"text":"Great food accompanied by a wonderful atmosphere! If you want to really experience what an exceptional Brazilian steakhouse is like, Fogo de chão will exceed your expectations!"}
{"text":"I came here recently for a Yelp event and I thought the food was amazing! The salad bar is a little smaller than some places but I was fine with the side of mash potatoes for my meats. Meat and potatoes go great together and this left me with more room for their addicting cheesy rolls!   The meat is so tender and flavorful here! This is why I prefer Fogo de Chao over their competitors. I tried their beef, lamb, sausage and even chicken. Typically at these places I will skip over the chicken but I would suggest trying their chicken ...it has a great flavor to it! I love that the meats were succulent and not tough or gamey tasting.   I also  think they have stellar customer service here. The wait staff always comes by to make sure you are doing okay. My husband asked for some well done beef and two people came out with it! It's wonderful thing because in some places it's a struggle to even get your water refilled!  The decor and presentation of Fogo de Chao is very welcoming . They even have the name of their restaurant engraved on their cutlery . When they pay this much attention to detail it tells me that they not only care about the quality of the food but also of the experience they are providing to their patrons."}
{"text":"I actually came here 2 weeks in a row..don't judge me ...haha. They had a great deal going on Veteran's day which was half off of the service member's meal with proof of service.   I want to talk about my Thanksgiving Day experience though. I decided to treat my family to Brazilian BBQ for a couple of reasons. My mom was fully prepared to wait in line at a casino to eat at the buffet. I know I would have been the one waiting in line while she played ...I had no patience for that! Especially when I walked through Red Rock Casino after we ate at Fogo De Chao I knew I made the correct choice because the lines were insane! Plus my mom has never experienced a Brazilian steakhouse. If you have never experienced one you need to go especially if you are a meat lover!      I would describe it as a roving meat buffet. They have a circular piece of paper on the table for each person. One side is green (keep the meat coming) and the other side is red (Please stop I'm stuffed) . The servers will bring things like garlic sirloin , New York Steak, chicken wrapped in bacon, sausage ,lamb etc right to your table. We are a beef loving family so we ignored most of the non beef items even the turkey. My brother was enjoying it he said,\"This was the best Thanksgiving he's ever had!\" ( very loudly) That says a lot because my mom is an awesome cook who always had a great spread of food for us during the holidays.  . My mom was also equally impressed . She loved the food and wanted to know if there was one in San Diego. The waiter said there is on in the Gas Lamp District.   They will also bring warm sides to the table like mash potatoes, plantains, and fresh bread. You can get lighter selections at their all you can eat salad bar. They have pineapple, mango , tabbouleh, and other veggies and fruits. Whenever I eat here I like getting their limeade to go with my meal. It's made of freshly squeezed limes.It's very tasty!  My birthday just passed so we celebrated it along with Thanksgiving. Fogo De Chao let me pick one of their desserts to have for my Birthday treat.   I couldn't have asked for a better place to spend the holiday because it wasn't overly crowded and the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Quick: Really sub standard service, meat variety and overall experience. Texas De Brazil finally confirmed as the winner.  Pros: Filet mignon is solid.   Cons: Caipirinha too sweet. Went a full 15 minutes without meat offered, during dinner rush. Same cut of beef offered 3 times in a row. Lots of poor performance, sours the tastes of the meal.  Fogo de Chao is renowned as a Brazilian steakhouse. I say nay! My expectation of a steakhouse like this is to see a server at least every few minutes when the green button is on and when a server does come by, at least to see the breadth of what the menu offers within a reasonable time.  The establishment is nice, easy to navigate and classy, if a bit smaller than Texas de Brazil. Everyone is courteous, friendly and when you speak with them, you feel taken care of... mostly. The issue lies in the execution really.  After we were seated, the 5 of us moved to the salad bar which, for unknown reasons, was entirely filled with people all the way around. Not one spot open to grab some side dishes and no one was moving. Everyone stood, seemingly in line, for a few select dishes. I don't know but after standing for 2 or 3 minutes, we decided to back load the salad bar for after \"rush hour\" and start with meat.  In the first 10 minutes, everything came fast and prompt. \"Sirloin sir?\" Yes indeed! Chicken, lamb, sirloin, pork, sirloin.... then came a 15 minute dead zone. We could not catch a server, or they had sliced off the last portion of beef to the parties before us. Meat offerings came sporadically few and far between for the rest of the night. It was strange.  Only after 40 minutes of noticing filet never came by, we made the request to our waiter. Filet began to flow, and it was tasty. But by then, the lull had set in and our stomachs felt full yet unfulfilled.  Essentially, Fogo de Chao might have had an off night. I'm sure they can be better than a 2 star but this night, this experience was a 2-star experience and it can never be anything else. We were looking forward to enjoying a complimentary experience to Texas de Brazil. We only hoped it would be the same quality but a different experience, but unfortunately it was only different by being a far inferior experience, fine steak or not.  Would I recommend it? I can't. Will you see it the way I did? Based on Yelp reviews, probably not and I know many that swear by Fogo de Chao. My Brazilian friend even said that the one in Beverly Hills is superb. But I won't recommend the Vegas one, or be returning. All I can say to them is, \"Ciao!\""}
{"text":"Great place ... but......wish the manager was better with his staff in front of customers!"}
{"text":"This might be one of my favorite restaurants ever and a must-stop every time I am in Vegas. All-you-can-eat meat, need I say more? And its high quality, juicy, tender meat at that! The baby lamb chops. Oh my god. I don't even remember the name of every cut of beef I've had there, but 90% of them were out of this world delicious. They even have some special cuts that they don't serve to everyone but you can get on special request. I've been lucky enough to come here with someone in the know and have gotten to try the special reserved cuts which were amazing! They also have a pretty extensive salad bar, but I try not to fill up on silly things like salad and vegetables when I come here. But one of the people in my group was a vegetarian, and he seemed completely satisfied with the meal he received from the salad bar. I felt a little bad I dragging a vegetarian to an all-you-can-eat meat place, but not really because its too good to pass up just cause you are being forced to dine with crazy non-meat eating people. And as long as you keep your card on the green the food keeps on coming. Now that's my kind of place!"}
{"text":"Yummy is what I would describe it. The salad bar was the one that really sold it to me. 5 stars to them! I recommend!"}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas, you MUST try out this Brazilian Steakhouse! Meat lovers will go crazy for this joint!  First, it is a classy establishment, so dress nice!  Waiters here are super sweet, since you are paying an arm or leg. Lunch is roughly $35/person, so be hungry!!  They start you off with some appetizers and a big salad bar on the side, but don't waste too much time on it! Even the waiters told us that you should save your stomach for the meat selection.  You get a card to use in getting your meat. Green means keep it coming, and Red means stop. The meat carriers will all stop by your table at a green. Every one is different and they circle around multiple times with freshly cooked meat.  The selection was amazing. Fresh sirloin, lamb chops, bacon wrapped chicken, the list goes on.  It is expensive, but it's definitely worth trying! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch. Fantastic service and great company. It was a wonderful way to end a long week."}
{"text":"Food here is not that great so much better Brazilian places then this .. I believe only reason why it is 4 in half stars on Yelp is because all the tourist and buisness peeps eat here but if if you are local better choices for Brazilian .. Salad bar is small, weak limited choices compared to Texas de Brazil and the other Brazilian place on fort apache. Service is ok."}
{"text":"came here with the hubby for the first time, for our date night,had a great time...and the steaks was delicious!...staffs was friendly and helpful. overall the place is beautiful. :)) hubby and I really enjoyed the foods."}
{"text":"Went here for AZ restaurant week. My bf and I walked in and were consumed by the absolute noise of this place. We asked to be seated in a more secluded area, which happened to be by a dining room filled with teenagers taking selfies, shouting, and running amok.   From the moment we sat down we felt rushed. \"Here's your bread, here's your non-refillable soda, go to the salad bar, here's some meat, are you done? No. Are you done now? No.\" The servers stopped at our table even when our signs on the table told them not to.   The food itself was mediocre. The potato salad was good, the mashed potatoes were salty, and all the meats were cooked rare and had a hint of butane and lighter fluid to them.   It reminded me of a buffet in Reno when a high school sports tournament is in town. It was so incredibly loud and crowded and definitely not worth the $100+ check. Good grief, never again."}
{"text":"we came today for lunch.  I've gone here before with no issues.  Today it was kind of just blah.  The salad bar was just okay this time around.  The fresh mozzarella seemed stale and dry.  Like it had been sitting a couple of days and the same with the potato salad.  The meat itself was decent.  I am very particular with my beef and need it well done.  So I told the one guy well done, he said ok I'll be back.  By the time he came back I had already turned my card over because I was finishing up what was on my plate and was getting pretty stuffed.  He came back about 15 minutes later and although my card was turned over to \"red\" he said well done?!  I said yes but I'm ok I'm full.  He still put it on my plate and it was beyond well done, it was outright charred and burnt.  That's all I could smell was burnt meat until the waitress took my plate.  Overall service was just ok.  No one went out of their way or smiled. Not sure If Ill return anytime soon!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a royal, \"Last Supper\" experience, this is definitely the place to go. Hands down, this is my favorite restaurant when I am craving carnage. LOL This restaurant has the most elaborate salad bar in Arizona! They really do a great job of providing dishes with top quality ingredients. There are perhaps 30 different salad/cold side-dish options. This is just a bonus to the main meal. Beyond The coveted salad bar, the concept of exotic meats freshly made and carved straight to your plate... Just genius. Although spendy, the price is definitely fair for the product and service which is provided."}
{"text":"This is Brazilian done right. Great food n ambiance. Good place to take someone special to impress. Casual attire makes you feel at home. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and had been dying to go back, so what better way to celebrate your birthday then to come to Fogo! My parents hadn't been before, so I explained to them how it all worked once we arrived and they absolutely LOVED it!   The salad bar is wonderful and more upscale than your normal salad bar. They have delicious vegetables, cheeses, Italian meats, and more. They also have beans and rice as well. All the meat they bring around to your table is delicious and it's all you can eat! One of the best things that they bring to the table is the Brazilian cheese bread...it is out of this world.   The service is always stellar and the food is always wonderful. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went here for my friends birthday for lunch and for lunch it's pretty reasonably priced. Also if you're doing a low-carb or no carb diet you can really score here. However the carbs did tempt me...."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. The food is delicious and the service is great!  Everyone is so nice and attentive even when it's crazy busy!  We go here every chance we get"}
{"text":"Great prices i believe it was $60 per person, but as i was leaving with my group we realized they have a happy hour. Definitely will be back for the rib eye steak and sirlion was just so yummy. I also loved the chicken it was seasoned so well !!! Loved the drink that my waiter recommend to have was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Went there for Valentines day  Not as impressed with the salad bar.. its was ok.   Everything else was great. Good steak and good service"}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 times and each time was a great experience. Because that's what it is- a dining experience. Eating at Fogo de Chao is much more than just eating. They have a great extensive wine list with selections from all over the world. A full bar offers anything you could ever want, and they brought a cart around with specialty Grand Marnier & Hennessy.   From the start, you know you're in a special place. The wait staff all work together, so there is always someone around to answer a question, get you a clean plate, recommend a good wine, etc. You don't have to wait on one person to get you the service you deserve.  The food starts with small, buttery popovers that melt in your mouth. One visit to the salad bar and you have so many options from salad to cheese, meats like prosciutto and smoked salmon, and vegetables. The presentation is incredible as the salad bar sits in the middle of the room and almost beckons you to get started.  Place your coin on green and it's GO time. They have various cuts of meat from top sirloin to ribeye to chicken to pork, lamb and sausage, and they don't have just one way to prepare it. Some of the filets come wrapped in bacon, some do not. The pork tenderloin is encrusted with Parmesan. In addition to the endless meat that is coming at your plate, they serve garlic mashed potatoes and fried polenta. There's so much going on but you have to pace yourself by turning the coin to red and make sure you get a taste of everything!   This past visit my boyfriend and I were celebrating the purchase of our new home and the sale of an old home. The wait staff found out about it & surprised us at the end of our meal with creme brulee (my favorite actually) with the words CONGRATULATIONS across the plate. It wasn't just a nice touch, it was people going above and beyond to make sure we had a great EXPERIENCE and we did.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fun experience if you've never gone before.  Traditional Brazilian steakhouse where they walk around with a variety of meats beef, lamb, pork and chicken. They stop at your table throughout the evening and slice the meat table side.The meal also includes a wonderful market bar that is full of a variety of salads, cheeses, and more. I am not much into meat so I opted to go just with the market bar. You do have the option to order a fish entree as well. I was pleased with the meal and enjoyed trying some new dishes I had never had before. The gentleman in our group said they liked the \"house specialty\" a top sirloin and the bacon wrapped chicken the best. Dinner was concluded with a yummy chocolate fudge cake."}
{"text":"The food is very good they slice the meat tableside. I wish I could eat more red meat but my stomach only allows so much before I feel sick. It cost around $110 dollars including tip and tax.  It was kinda of pricey! I did go here for New Years Eve and it was soooooo busy I could barely make it to the salad bar. The service was very good and im not sure if I would eat here again.!!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a different experience but soon enough I realized this chain is  overstated, overrated and overpriced.   The salad bar was good, thus my two star rating.    The meats offered were not up to par.  Having enjoyed good Argentinian Churrazcos and similar fares in other South American venues, what Fago the Chao offers, at least at their store in Scottsdale, is simply different cuts of flavorless  meats, very thinly sliced, served by comically attired \"gauchos\" servers.  The slices of the couple meats we requested were not thick enough to sink our teeth in to. Obviously, I was not expecting the 3/4\" slices of beef that usually are served in a chrrasqueria, with the choripan, morcillas, chimichurrry and other sort of accompaniment. I know I was not dining in Bnos. Airres but, I expected something slightly better.    We cut our experience off soon enough, paid our hefty bill and decided to write this restaurant off our list."}
{"text":"The ambiance is awsome waiters are very accommodating to our needs when it comes to the meat temperature to sum it up this place is a beautiful to bring friends and family ."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, stay on the strip or the hotels.  Fogo in Boston is pretty good, this Fogo didn't hit our expectations.  The service was slow it would take about 10 minutes to get filet.  In Vegas I would have expected the meat to be on my plate within seconds.  The salad bar was lacking and this was 7pm.  Next time we will stay on the strip."}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to try this place for years. This year was my 40th birthday and what a better place to try than Fogo.    My girlfriend and I made reservations with her brother and wife.  What I loved is when we showed up, we were seated immediately.  I've been to places with a reservation and they would say \"Oh it'll be just a moment\" and 10 min later...  Right as we sit down, one of our many wait staff comes over to us to take our drink orders and lets us know that we can begin our meal.  They have a huge salad bar, but I was told by a friend \"Do NOT eat it if you want to fill up on meat!\"   So my girlfriend got the salad bar and I ate some of the cheese. It was delicious!  We guys flipped over our card to green and it was on.  We must have seen 10 different guys come by with different meats.  My favorites were their house special, sirloin and filet wrapped in bacon.  We ate like kings!    To top it off we even had room for cheesecake.  I highly recommend this place. It was pure heaven.  It is a bit pricey though.  ABout $50 a head.  But soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"5 star food but 4 star dining. The selections of meat were very flavorful and delicious. I didn't think there was a large variety but a variety nonetheless. The table appetizers as well as the cheese bread provided was phenomenal. One of my favorite meet selections is the sirloin wrapped in bacon, sooooooo good.   The hot dishes at the salad bar wasn't too fresh in my opinion, the Caesar salad was doused in dressing  which didn't leave it edible in my Opinion. The cocktails we're great, I had a premium signature cocktail (Brazilian specialty) and thought it was quiet delicious. Dessert was excellent.  The wait staff was very attentive and friendly, everyone besides our waiter helped and chipped in to make our visit special. Honestly I wanted to give 5 stars but for such a \"fine dining\" price it could have been better."}
{"text":"Number 1 tip:  Come here starving - not hungry.  For those of you that have never been to a Brazilian steak house.  It is an all you can eat steak / meat place, where the servers come around with various cuts of meats on large swords.  The meats range from filet mignon wrapped in bacon to chicken and cheese and everything in between.   You must try the Brazilian cheese breads.  They are chewy and very cheesy.  They also fried plantains - which makes a good side, the sweetness will cut through the saltiness and richness of the meats.  I wish they would also serve the fried cassava / yucca - which can be found all the competitors.   They also have a full salad bar, with an abundance of meats, cheeses, pastas, and veggies.  A must for me here - the smoked salmon.  Please note that dessert is not included the meal - that's if you even have room for it."}
{"text":"I love Fogo but I feel like they're always trying to rush me out, and no I don't stay for hours lol. The salad bar is amazing, the wine list is great and it is a meat lovers paradise. Don't turn your card to \"red\" for too long or they will clean up the whole table and kick you out! That's the worst and it has unfortunately happened to me more than once."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Fogo de Chão. When we lived in Houston several years ago we used to go quite often. I believe that is the first location in the US, so we are like pioneers. Then, just a year or so after we moved to Phoenix, they opened one in Scottsdale. And now there is one in our home-away-from-home city, Las Vegas. Hooray!  This location is much like the others though the decor was a little nicer, I think.  Food was excellent as always.  There is such a variety of meat, I think anyone could find a cut to their liking.  And as for the red and green sauces, they make it that much better! And don't  forget about the salad bar. So much good stuff. I love the marinated veggies like hearts of palm, artichokes, and mushrooms.  Oh, and those little round red sweet peppers.  Have one of those with some fresh mozzarella and sun dried tomato. Yummy!  The service here was phenomenal.  We had a pleasant time with the bartender while waiting for my sister and her husband to arrive. She was nice enough to get us some of that amazing cheesy bread to munch on while we waited. I forgot her name but she is from Omaha and makes one awesome Caipirinha!  Once they arrived and we were all seated, my sister discovered she was missing one of her diamond earrings.  Practically the whole staff stopped what they were doing to help look for it.  The manager (I think) even came by and expressed genuine concern. Long story short it turned out to be at the babysitters house, must have fallen off while she was bringing the baby inside.  It was just nice to see a place where the staff is so friendly and really cares about their customers."}
{"text":"This is meat lover heaven!! The service was really good and they explained the type of meat options. I loved the variety of options for different cuts of meat. The wine selections were great as well. I would revisit again."}
{"text":"I have been anxiously awaiting for Fogo to open!!    Went there for lunch today.  Was so happy with the lunch market table, which is a great deal! $15 for an outstanding selection.  The soup was great, the food on the buffet was constantly refreshed, and who doesn't love all you can eat charcuterie!!  Docking a star because the service needs some fine tuning.  We were there in their second day open, and you could tell the staff were overly anxious to have good customer service.  Unfortunately, it was incredibly annoying.  My party could barely finish a sentence before a staff member was checking in, taking out plates, cleaning the table, asking if we want dessert, every time we turned around someone was hovering at our table.  After our waiter butted in to ask us very probing and personal questions, It got to the point where we basically had to ask them to leave us alone so we could have a conversation. Unbelievably awkward!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Brazilian steakhouse, and all I can say is... WOW. My group decided to celebrate our last night in Vegas with a meal here, and each and every one of us immensely enjoyed our decision.   Our waiter was amazing, engaging, friendly, and didn't rush us at all. Our reservation was on the later side, and even though we were there well past the restaurant closing, he did not hurry us once. We truly enjoyed our interaction with him, and he patiently explained each seasoning on the meat, and each menu item. His wine suggestion was very good, and not something I would have selected without his recommendation.   The salad bar was all very fresh. I sampled tiny bits of a lot of the items, but I didn't want to get too full, because to be completely honest, we were all there to sample the meat.   At times, the choices were a little overwhelming. It is pricey, but SOO worth it."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I am a steak lover! Service is great and the quality of the meat it's amazing!"}
{"text":"GREAT Service and delicious!  Texas De Brazil was a 2 hour wait on Father's Day so we were like hell ta-da no.  I'm glad we came to Fogo De Chao because I ended up liking it more than Texas De Brazil.  The staff was amazing--always checking up on us. They cleared our plates and refilled us consistently.  We felt like royalty!  Food was fresh and well prepared.  Loved their huge salad bar, however I wished they had soup or bisque like T.D.B.  Pricing was a little higher than T.D.B but by a couple dollars.  I'd say it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Three stars was for the service that was received. Also a small deduction for the food when compared to others I have visited.  They mostly kept up with delivering the meat when the cards were flipped to green but occasionally they slacked and we were kept waiting a few minutes with empty plates. Many times we also had empty glasses in need of filling that took waaaaaayyyyyy too long. I have ate at three Fogo restaurants and an off brand Brazilian steakhouse and this was by far my least favorite.  The meat selections were just not as good and well prepared as other locations I have visited. I will not say it was bad though, some of the selections were good, just kinda hit and miss. The salad bar here was also lacking when compared to others, a lot less selections and options....not a big deal with me as the salad offerings are not what I come for.  Still a decent option to visit in Phoenix but try the Houston or Sao Paulo Brazil locations.... will blow your socks off."}
{"text":"Really, really good food as with all of these chains, but this place also has very good customer service and keep in touch with you throughout your meal to ensure you are happy each step of the way."}
{"text":"Never fails! Awesome food, amazing service...Lou was amazing at checking on us and making sure we were doing well....we were literally the last in the restaurant and he never made us feel rushed.....Food is delicious as always and Thank you Lou, for another fabulous experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Always great. I'm very glad a decent steakhouse opened inside Summerlin mall. We've dined here several times and the food is very flavorful. The ambience is modern, open concept and very clean. The service is professional and the runners are quick to make their rounds to provide top quality meats."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.  Food? Amazing Service? Impeccable Location? Awesome  But what REALLY made this place stand out was the presentation. Everything was presented so beautifully that I felt like I wasn't in Vegas, I felt as if I was in some foreign locale, being treated to world class fare. Yes, its a buffet, but... Its more than that. Its... I don't know know how to describe it... Its an experience. Worth the price, worth the drive (I live in Henderson), just worth it. Try it. You won't regret it. (Loved the Parmesan pork chops)"}
{"text":"These five stars are well deserved.  This restaurant is incredible, everything from the service to salad bar is top notch.  My boyfriend and I had reservations right at 4 PM on a sunday, which is when they open. We got seated quickly, and then ventured on to the salad bar. Everything was so fresh and presented so beautifully. I love how they didn't have the typical salad bar items, but instead had things like artichoke hearts, etc. The meats were all delicious, but I particularly liked the bacon wrapped filet mignon. Nom nom! :)  I actually didn't end up eating much of the meat because of the darn cheese bread! It's simply addicting. I couldn't stop eating them :)  Service was perfection, our server (totally forgot his name... Michael? I really need to start writing names down so I can give yelp shoutouts for excellent service :), was very attentive and quick to bring things out. I ordered a drink, but it was INCREDIBLY STRONG, so the waiter actually took it back and had the bartender change it up slightly, so it would be less strong.  For dessert we got creme brulee. If there is room left in the stomach, I hightly recommend it! It was quite delicious.  Though I experienced dinner here, I can't imagine lunch being that much different, so I would definitely recommend coming here for lunch. It's about half the price and the food is pretty much the same. :)"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 3.5 stars.  I suggested this place for the hubby's family who are all meat lovers and have never been to a Brazialian steakhouse.  They were so amazed at how many meat selections were coming at them from left and right, they were in meat heaven!    As for me I have to say, I'm not much of a meat lover, so I indulged mostly on their salad bar....probably one of the best salad bar I've experienced for a Brazialian steakhouse, nice fresh selections of salmon, cheese, pastas, and so on.    Their lamb chops where the best that I've had.  I did not care for their filet mignon wrapped in bacon, it was a little flavorless. All in all, it was a great experience with all servers and staff!"}
{"text":"Came here twice and this place never let me down!   We made a reservation on Open table at 8pm on a Tuesday night and surprisingly it was overbooked so we had to wait at the bar for about 30min. My boyfriend and I didn't really like that because that's the whole point of a reservation. But it is during the convention week and I think it means the food must be good! We sat at the bar and had their special drink Caipirinha. It was amazing and there, I wouldn't mind waiting :)   Once we are seated, our server Sergio came right away to take our drink orders and explained how they \"fogo\" here. A little bit later, their manager Ricardo came and said hi. We are very happy at how friendly people here are. They have a salad bar in the center of the restaurant and it has pretty much everything, rice and beans, also lettuce, cucumber, tomato, mushrooms, celery,etc. you name it. As for the meat, my favorite is the lamb with mint jelly. All their other meats are amazing too! My boyfriend literally started to sweat from eating lol we are both on the edge of a meat coma after an hour here.   They have a card on the table and you are flip them to indicate if you want more. The Green one is more and the red means no thank you. They will keep coming if it is green. The first thing that surprise me is that most of the workers there are from Brazil, managers and cooks. Another thing is that each  \"meat server\" is not just a server, they are actually the executive chefs and in charge of their own meat station. That's why they can tell how cooked the meat are and which kind you want!   At the end of dinner, I am very positive I am pregnant with food baby! I think my boyfriend too he just wouldn't admit it lol We were so full that we couldn't even move! But wait, what's going on?! The manager brought us desert : their famous flan. It is amazing! The sweet thing is not just the flan but he actually had  \"xie xie\" written in chocolate on the plate for us! because I had mentioned I am from China when he came to the table the first time. My heart melted at that very moment. It is just not a business no more, not just a manager and customers relationship , but more personal and more like friends visiting each other now. I am truly impressed.   Will I come back again? ABSOLUTELY!"}
{"text":"There was no doubt where I was going to take J for his Father's Day dinner/lunch.  FOGO it was going to be!  I did however have a little hesitation on taking Baby C along with us.  Would they have high chairs?  Never saw any babies/toddlers there in our visits there.  Baby C can be a pretty messy eater, with a good portion of his food ending up on the floor.  And, while Baby C is pretty well behaved, he is now known to start testing his vocal cords out - chattering very loudly and screaming with excitement.  I was reassured when I made my reservations, that they did in fact have highchairs (30 in fact), not to worry about any mess Baby C would make, that there would be plenty of kids there, and it would be pretty loud.    Mother's Day and Father's Day - who leaves their kids with a babysitter anyway?!  I tell you what, I am glad I made a reservation for us and indicated we would need a high chair, because there was apparently a wait - On High Chairs!!    Our service was kinda so-so, but I attribute that to the fact that there were a TON of families there (we had a 2:30 reservation).  So many people in fact that I believe they ran out of meat, as we were waiting for quite a bit for a gaucho to come by wielding his sword of meat.   My favorite - The Lamb..hands down.  Baby C's favorite too!!"}
{"text":"My previous experience was fantastic at a Brazilian steakhouse called Texas de Brazil I went to on business travel in Tampa, Florida. With that experience in mind, I expected to have a similar experience and the leading Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chao; however, I was let down by the atmosphere, food, and salad bar.    Atmosphere: Tables are very close together, especially the salad bar area which is very cramped. The layout is very broken and I expected more for a $$$ restaurant. There just isn't much energy, and it felt like a quiet family sit-down restaurant.    Service: They move to fast and need to do a better job announcing the type of meat being carried around. Maybe it would be better to have tags/labels on the tops of the meat spits as they carry it around. Often, my card is on red waiting for a specific cut of meat; however, they move so fast you don't have an option to flip your card before the cut of meat you want is gone.    Food: Wasn't impressive. It is under-seasoned even when using basic seasoning. Regarding the selection, I have to compare it to Texas de Brazil who did a much better job circulating different cuts of meat - mixing up top shelf beef cuts. Fogo de Chao circulated flank steak and top sirloin about 3 to 1, arguably to fill you up on lesser cuts - I didn't even see Ribeye which is insane. The salad bar was also very unimpressive. My wife doesn't eat a lot of meat, and for $22 you can just order the salad bar which I expected to be much better.    For the price I would have much rather spent my money at Ruth Chris, Fleming's, Morton's, or Capital Grill and get a much better cut of meat."}
{"text":"WOW!  I am so glad Rain insisted on eating here and skipping the buffet lines and all the other cheap Vegas dining options. We had a wonderful dining experience here. From the moment you walk in to when you're paying your check and leaving, everyone was just so pleasant and made us feel so welcomed to this restaurant.   The meat was overflowing so the red/green signal definitely helped direct the flow of meat. I was clueless at first, eventually got the hang of it and didn't miss out on a lot of meats. I guess we got lucky because we were seated by the meat source. We got first choice on some of the meats. Some were a little to rare for my taste. They also had a good spread of salad, bread, and cheeses.   Thanks Yelp Spring Break! Wouldn't have come here if it wasn't for your irresistible offer!"}
{"text":"Upscale dinning that's pricey but very good! Would recommend for a nice date dinner"}
{"text":"For my second time to Fogo De Châo, I was once again pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food. This steakhouse is unlike any other dining experience you will ever try. Our servers were Luigi and Chris. They were the most attentive and personable servers I've ever met. They made my date and I feel as though we were in their home for a private dinner. Marco the manager definitely cares about the service and quality of this restaurant and knows the business from bottom to top. We are making this place at least a monthly dining affair."}
{"text":"Got to celebrate my birthday here! In fact we've done the majority of our big celebrations here. And I never regret it. I have been to handful of Brazilian steakhouses and we keep coming back to Fogo!! The meet is always incredible and the salad bar never disappoints!! In fact I would be happy to go and just have the salad bar!! Bacon wrapped chicken and sirloin steak are my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Perfect.  I was unsure about this place because it seemed to \"out there\". But I went with a group of friends and it was excellent.  They have a small but very well made salad bar.  Their appetizer are pretty good too.    They main draw here is the meat, you flip these little coasters over from red to green and they start bringing you lots of meat.   I mean a LOT!  and it always good, always.    The service was also amazing, at one point we had a waitress just standing there waiting for ask to \"need\" something.  I wanted to sample a drink and they gave me the drink for free! :D  I had a great experience and will come back here."}
{"text":"excellent as always except this Fogo was a little slow on the service and kinda stingy with the meats.  I'm a Fogo regular across the country  I've been to Philly, NYC, Las Vegas, Orlando, Atl, Denver and this one was a little subpar."}
{"text":"This place is good but it loses points for being stupid and not leaving something on their voicemail when they won't be open for short periods of time. Wasted time for my moms birthday by driving all the way out here only to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and agree with Kuong that this is Vegas's best kept secret! Even with the place packed we were able to still get seated quickly:) Food = A+, Service = A+. Just when you think you've eaten all you could eat, they stroll by with more delicious food... and you try another piece. Definitely my absolute favorite restaurant right now!!!"}
{"text":"Omgosh! This place is a sin!!! The meat they bring out is delicious and they keep it coming.  I don't think I can move.  At first I was a little overwhelmed once I turned my card to green, there had to be four men at my table trying to give me their meat ;). I had a moment of nostalgia with the leg of lamb, taste like what my great grandma use to make."}
{"text":"As Best-man and host of my brothers Bachelor Party, this was a much needed treat for the whole group of county boys, and a much needed moment of R&R (rest and relaxation) for everyone. Since I made reservations, and we arrived on-time, check-in and being seated was seconds. Everything from the buffet selection, to the meats, to the mint jam was simply delectable and did much more than satisfied my brother and his friends. I ordered a glass of scotch (12yr Glen Levitt) to partner with the wide variety of strong and subtle flavors but paired extremely well with the lamb and mint jam combination. The highlight was definitely the desert. While checking-in I told the front hostesses that this was my brothers Bachelor Party and how I wasn't sure if Fogo did anything special for such occasions. They responded that they might be able to do something like a complimentary desert, but they would let my server and chef know. At the end of the meal they brought my brother his desert which was two full round servings of flan on a large plate with a raspberry reduction. Not only was the flan delicious, the perfect light and delicate balance of not too sweet or maple tasting, but the chef had arranged the flan to represent breasts, with blueberry nipples, and drew the female body with the drizzles of raspberry reduction. Most of my group expressed that eating at Fogo was the nicest restaurant that they have ever been not just because the food was delicious but because it was the best group experience we had together. Fogo De Chao, Las Vegas, was the epitome of service and ambiance which was the cherry, or blueberry, to top our memorable experience in Vegas celebrating my twin brothers last days as a Bachelor."}
{"text":"OMG! MEAT LOVERS PARADISE!  Don't even bother with the other Brazilian BBQ places! Come here, and come HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"Bring your appetite. Don't be a fool a fill up on the bomb salad bar though. Make sure you ask for the filet minon, sometimes it can take awhile to find your table."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience for a birthday... service was terrible, we were passed over for food service and after 3 reminders about my son's birthday, they forgot!  For the expense, definitely not worth it!  I will never go back again."}
{"text":"I recommend going for lunch. It's from 11:30-2 and price is $20 less than dinner. Salad bar is fresh and plentiful with all the meats coming hot to your table.  I took off a star because I didn't get the lamb until the second time around and I was almost full. Another star because they didn't come around to fill our waters until we asked. I haven't been to the other competitors in the area but I like that they are open for lunch while the others are not"}
{"text":"We came here over the 4th of July and there was a 4th of July special with kids were free with paid adults.  There were 7 of us and 3 of them were kids so they were free.  My husband and I are fans of Texas de Brazil.  We agreed that the salad options here were more options and better tasting.  My husband enjoyed their picaña and it was our favorite meat.  My review was based on first impression on this location. We haven't been to many locations of Fogo de Chão so we can't really compare but we are frequent customers to Texas de Brazil and it does have it's inconsistency sometimes.  But, our visit here was excellent."}
{"text":"This place was THE BEST! I made a reservation celebrating my husbands birthday & I must say Fogo de Chao was an excellent choice. My family & I were treated so well & the food was awesome especially the variety of meat! Dessert was very yummy. There were classic & new desserts I never had. The price was very reasonable for the amount of food we all ate. Servers frequently checked on us seeing if we wanted specific meats, giving us new bread when the bread on the table got cold, bringing us fresh side dishes every so often. It was GREAT! I highly recommend this steakhouse & think you'll be satisfied with full bellys!"}
{"text":"Carnivores only! Rodízio style. Great deal if you come hungry.  Be careful not to fill up on sides. The meats are amazing! Service and drinks were on point."}
{"text":"The Best Steak House ~ Brazilian style!!  Fogo de Chao is our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!  If you are craving great meats, nicely seasoned, cooked perfectly.... look no further!!  Go to Fogo de Chao at their new location in Downtown Summerlin!  Avail of their Summer Feast at $30 for lunch; $40 for dinner ~ Eat what you can!  This includes their sumptuous Salad Bar and 8 meats!  Salad Bar only is $15.  This promo ends Sept. 30th.  White cloth table top; nice place settings; excellent service!  Their cheese bread and all the sides are amazing!  The wonderful manager at this location is Chris Kuhn.  He makes sure all the guests are taken cared of and enjoying their meal.  My family highly recommends Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse in Downton Summerlin!!"}
{"text":"The service here is beyond amazing! I don't think I've ever been to any restaurant that has service this great. The salads are fresh and delicious and the Brazilian cheese bread they give you is addicting and delicious! I like my meat medium so everything was cooked to perfection. My husband however will only eat it well done so it took a few tries for them to get it right, which is fine because they were more than willing to accommodate and make some just for him. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after I saw the reviews on the Yelp. But I highly recommend you don't go there if you love quantity of meat. The service was pretty good but the quality of beef, pork, amd chicken was so bad!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken wings are too salty. Lamb is not cooked well and has a little smell. Beef are great in general. Ans waiters and waitresses are really nice."}
{"text":"One word to describe this place: amazing. Our server Luis was fantastic; super friendly and attentive. He had our glasses filled before they were even half empty. The food was excellent, especially the lamb chops and pork ribs. It was me and my boyfriend's anniversary and we definitely enjoyed the experience. Thanks for a great anniversary dinner!"}
{"text":"The meat tasted great! The salad bar was okay. I only liked the apple salad. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My folks and i got totally spoiled here  We went the first time to a brazilian steakhouse and didn't know what to expact. It also was my birthday Dinner and we were overwhelmed by salad buffet. Right after we came back with out plates the server startet to bring all those finest meats. Ribs, bacon wrapped, Filet Mignon, Parmesan Pork  just flip your cards to green!  Our son got a icecream from the server and we were allowed to see the kitchen. Best experience in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place. On one hand, it's expensive and the service is lacking. On the other hand...meat.  We came to dinner with a group of 5 and while we had a TON of fun, there were definitely some need for improvement. I was really surprised - in a chain restaurant like this, the service is usually solid and they operate like a well-oiled machine. That wasn't the case for us.  One of my huge pet peeves in a restaurant is when you get food before your drinks. We had bread on the table and at least one round of meat before even one drink was served. After that, it took another ten minutes to get our bottle of wine.  The gauchos were all super nice - but a lot of the meat was overcooked and just so-so. We talked to a couple of the gauchos and the manager, and they ended up bringing some rarer meat after the first few rounds.  I didn't spend much time in the salad bar (as my boyfriend would say, \"that's how they get ya!\") but I did have some great cheese and Italian(?) meats.   I'll likely be back, but mainly because...meat."}
{"text":"OK, so maybe my barbarian talk review was lost on many readers so I have decided to edit my initial review of Fogo. Needless to say, this place will bring out the inner meat eating barbarian in all of us.   I have been to the Fogo de Chao in Philadelphia and the one in Scottsdale numerous times, both locations offer the freshest items and both have their signature wait staff who bring the meat on the fly when your card is green.   If you're bringing new initiates, advise them to come prepared. That being said, this place isn't a \"buffet\". It is a bit classier than that and as I mentioned, you will be getting quality items from both the salad bar and the main course with excellent service all around. Regardless if you get \"your money's worth\", it is an experience everyone should enjoy at least once.   The Philadelphia location is right in center city and the AZ location is in yuppy Scottsdale. However, like \"Jason V.\" mentioned, there were definitely more family tables at the AZ location than the one in Philly. No judging here either, but I agree that Fogo is not the place to bring infants and toddlers."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often, but this time I was informed they are assigning a waiter to your table, where as before you could have a few.  Although they've done this, all of the staff is still available (I hate when you ask someone for help, and they send your waiter over to take your request) to assist.  This is always a great place for good food."}
{"text":"My mother and I didn't know what to expect. We've never been to this type of restaurant. The food was amazing and the staff were fantastic. I loved the selection at the salad bar. And their meats were so good! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go to Brazil!! People, if you're a meat lover, you'll love love love this place! By far the best Brazilian place I've been to. Lamb was fantastic, all steaks were so delicious and tender, my favorite was top sirloin. Lamb chops...mmmmm!! Service outstanding, great atmosphere!! Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"This place has a very good selection of meat. From rib eye, fillet, fillet wrapped with bacon, tenderloin, lamb, lamb chop, pork rib and many more that I missed. I wish I could have all of the servers line up in front of me and let me choose the meat right from the beginning. Because I feel like it's kind of hard to catch all of them. If you are a meat lover, you really can't go wrong with this place.  All of the meat are perfectly cook, maybe 1 out 10 is a little overcook, but mostly they do a pretty good job.   The seasoning, nothing fancy is just kosher salt and pepper. They believe, that's the best way to bring out the most flavor of a good piece of meat.  I disagree with some reviewer that say the meat are lightly seasoned. When I was there, some of the meats are too salty. I think it will be depends on the the chef that works that day.   Salad bar, I really wish I can have a soup from the salad bar. For me that's a big letdown. I love the lobster bisque at Texas de Brazil. I could have 3-4 cups of them. Fogo doesn't even have any soup. Because of that, I would have to take away one star.   Service and atmosphere are top notch.   Price is kind of high. But it's understandable, considering that the location is kind of close to the strip. Just be careful, if you get a couple drinks with a dessert. Your bill will easily goes to around $70 per person for lunch or over $100 per person for dinner. Most desserts are around $10 per plate which is a little bit higher than Texas de Brazil.  I still think the meat here are a pinch better than Texas. but not by much. Overall, I would still rather go to Texas de Brazil, just because they have a better salad bar."}
{"text":"This place is overrated.  We kept getting served flank steak, top sirloin, chicken, and pork ribs.   C'mon, for this price I expect more.  The cuts tasted fine, but are definitely not as tasty as the yelp reviews imply.  The meat is also way too salty.  I'm surprised people aren't stroking out on the spot.  The service was subpar for the price range.  I get better service at my local Chinese joints in Rowland and that speaks volumes.  They tried to charge my 11 year old son full price without even asking his age first.  They asked me if I was done and I said 'almost,' and before I knew it the server already took my utensils.  You're telling me they couldn't even wait till we left to clear the table.  They took forever to clear the plates during dinner.  Small table for four and our plates were piled 3 plates deep at times.  This was our first and last visit to Fogo."}
{"text":"This is the best Brazilian steakhouse in Vegas. The variety of meat that they carve right at the table is awesome, The service is friendly, prompt and attentive. And they definitely serve excellent NOT watered down cocktails."}
{"text":"I was so excited for my first Brazilian experience!  I couldn't take my eyes off the Churrasco (roasted meat on an open fire) which welcomes you as soon as you enter!   Taking our seat, we are graciously greeted by our server and informed of our 5 step process for an unforgettable experience: Step 1: Visit our gourmet salad and sides bar. Enjoy over 30 items including fresh cut vegetables, imported cheeses, cured meats and Brazilian side dishes.  Step 2: Turn your card green side up, signaling that you are ready for our gaucho chefs to begin tableside service.  Step 3: Choose from the 15 cuts of delectable fire roasted meats that are brought to your table, sliced, and served by our gaucho chefs.  Step 4: When you are satisfied, flip the disc to the red side until you are ready for more offerings.  Step 5: If you wish, end the meal with one of our delicious desserts  The salad bar was impressive! My jaw dropped when I saw the jumbo asparagus and tabbouleh salad! I would have been satisfied with just that, but before I could cover my entire plate with greens, I looked ahead and was the imported cheeses, artisan breads, cured meats! When we returned, we had pão de queijo (warm cheese bread),  polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas waiting for us at our table!  These side dishes were delicious! It was extremely hard not to fill up on the salad bar and sides!  Ready for dinner, we flipped our card to green! The gaucho chefs were a little slow on service but our server was right there to take any request to help speed up the process! I have to be honest, we weren't a fan of most but found 2 of the 10 varieties, the Cordeiro (Leg of Lamb) and Lamb TBone, our favorite! We didn't waste our time and passed on everything else! We had about 4 rounds of the Lamb Leg and TBone!   Our server insisted we order dessert but we just didnt have room in our tummy's! He asked us to look at the menu and tell him what we would have ordered if we could, so we told him the Fogo de Chão Signature Papaya Cream.  Along with the check, he presented us a complimentary bag of the papaya cream!   Hopefully all locations provide the same food and experience we have had here in AZ!"}
{"text":"The meats were delicious, the price was high, and the servers were not all that friendly. The taste of the cuts earned the place a 4 at least. But when your servers aren't happy to be there, or warm with the customers, I have to mark you down.   If you've never been to a brazillian steakhouse (churrascaria), they cook various meats Portugese BBQ style, and serve them to you tableside on huge skewers, with big knives! You use little tongs to grab the meat as they cut it, and away they go to the next table. You use an object, sometimes a wooden dowell, or here you use a table coaster to turn it to the green side when you'd like them to keep serving you meat, turn it to red when you want to take a break.   I enjoyed the sirloin, the lamb, the chicken legs, and the sausage. The salad bar is amazing, and the sides they bring you include cheese bread, friend plantains,whipped potatoes, and these little polenta sticks dusted with parmesean. I had a beer with dinner, and the molten lava cake for dessert.  About $75.00 for everything, and it was just me."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, down to the tomatoes and kale salad. All the waiters were very attentive and made us feel like royalty. A Filipino waiter came to our table and was very nice and welcoming! It makes me a little sad that I was only visiting Scottsdale, as I would love to dine here again.   When they tell you the waiters will attack you with skewers of meat if you keep the card green, they really will come to you nonstop. They kind of rush off quickly, so state that you also want a piece if they are at your table.   The only reason why I dinged a star off was because when my dad asked for a piece of rare filet mignon, the server said none of the pieces were rare but he would get another skewer. Another server came by a few minutes later with another skewer and cut the most well-done piece of meat before rushing off."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Best meat I had in long time.  I went in during lunch time and price was reasonable for all you can eat quality meat.  I would give this place 5 star but can't afford to go here for dinner.  Awesome dining experience."}
{"text":"If you like fine dinning then you will love this place...they walk around with all different kinds of cuts of meat and chicken ect... If ur full flip this card they give you that is red on one side for stop and green for keep the food coming and you WILL be impressed...service was beyond exceptional I couldn't help but to be blown away, very unique place"}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe that the Simpson's have not parodied the Brazilian Steakhouse, yet.  Seems like it would be Homer's fantasy come true.    Came here with a couple of friends who were taking me to lunch for my birthday.  This was my first time eating here, and I always read in the reviews of other places that this is the place that all of the other Brazilian steakhouses in Phoenix are compared to.  This place is top dog for a reason.  The restaurant itself is very nice with white linen, rich wood paneling, and a spacious dining room.    What can you say?  If you are a vegetarian, the salad bar is really incredible.  Figuring we would cushion the blow, we started at the salad bar.  I ended up making a plate for myself resembling an antipasto platter.  It was excellent.  There were cheeses, and prosciutto, marinated asparagus an inch think, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and things I did not identify, but were tasty anyway.  Once we were done dabbling in the vegetables, cheeses, and prosciutto of the salad bar it was time to get down to business; it was time for meat.    Each person has a coaster-like card that is red on one side and green on the other.  We flipped our coasters to green, and immediately we were overwhelmed by an onslaught of meat.    Like Homer would do, I just indiscriminately tried everything.  Don't ask me what I had, because I was too busy talking to my friends, drinking caipirinhas, and eating meat.  There was also polenta, fried banana, black beans, and bread.  Everything was tasty and delicious.  I ate way too much.  I glanced at the dessert menu, but was just too full to even seriously consider it.   The service is outstanding.  The wait staff was falling all over us serving meat, filling drinks, and bringing more bread, bananas, and polenta.  We never were without anything.  If you are interested in a Brazilian steakhouse in the Phoenix area, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Wow, my first time there and I would definitely recommend!!! The meat was great and the creme Brule was to die for!  We had a server named Junior and he was the nicest server we have ever had.  His service was exceptional and made our experience so good that we will definitely tell our friends and return.  The only thing I didn't like is the soda is so small and 4 bucks!! Who charges for refills these days!?"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place, ate so much I felt sick the next day and didn't need to eat until the next evening.  We came near the end of the evening, about 8ish. Some of the meats they didn't bring around, but if you requested them they cooked a skewer to get it for you. The lamb t-bones were unbelievable, each bite was a small orgasm in the mouth. The filet Mignon varied, the first skewer was excellent the second one they brought around was still good and tender but not as good as the first. The bacon wrapped filet was delicious as well each time they brought it around.  Definitely an experience worth repeating!"}
{"text":"I think they did a good job with everything.  It's a chain of course, but they kept it solid.  It's not gonna be cheap folks. You aren't going to the sizzler."}
{"text":"My fiance, friend, and I came here on 04/25/2013 for a fundraising dinner benefiting Junior Achievement of Las Vegas. The experience and service was wonderful.  I really enjoyed the traditional Brazilian side dishes. Especially the Pão de Queijo (warm cheese bread), crispy hot polenta (basically polenta fries), and caramelized bananas. Their salad bar is wonderful! I enjoyed some aged Manchego cheese, Prosciutto, Artichoke Hearts, Smoked Salmon, Italian Salami, Asparagus, broccoli, etc. We tried almost all the different cuts of meat they offer. The Picanha (their signature steak, prime cut of top sirloin. ), Filet Mignon, Filet Mignon wrapped in Bacon, Linguica (sausage), Lombo (pork loin), Costela de Porco (pork ribs), Cordeiro (lamb chop), Alcatra (special cut of top sirloin), and Frango (chicken) wrapped in Bacon. For dessert, I got their Signature Papaya Cream.  I'm assuming because they were busy and overwhelmed, I was passed frequently even with the green side showing on my card. I had to flag down our server a couple times to ask him to bring specific cuts that we wanted. Gratefully, our server was awesome and very attentive. Anyway, I didn't really enjoy any of the cuts. Some were cooked more to my liking (medium rare to rare), but I received a lot of overdone and dry cuts (especially the chicken, blah) and the filet wrapped in bacon was disappointingly overdone as well. I know it's not made-to-order and \"buffet\" style, but I didn't enjoy the meat as much as I feel I should have and the green/red card was useless!"}
{"text":"A big Hurrah! to Fogo for their excellent service and food. I took a social group this week, (all women), which as we all know, they are so hard to please. From start to finish the experience was wonderful. Fogo had great food; the salad bar, the meats, WOW! I am not a big meat eater so usually would only take the salad bar if coming here but the meat was so good, especially the lamb, pork and beef. We had a few glitches but really not worth talking about. The décor is beautiful and again, from wait staff to bartender to management, the service was excellent. Thank you Fogo, we will be back."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to try Fogo and I saw that they were on the list for AZ Restaurant Week so I made a reservation for 3 and never looked back. I arrived first and the rest of our party was running late so I was offered a seat at the bar and looked over the menu while my friends joined me. I was asked by staff passing a few times if I needed anything and was eventually brought out a basket of fresh bread while I waited. Once we were seated, our server gave us the run down and we made our way to the salad bar. It was sizable, but not as huge as I expected. Knowing what was ahead of me, I just sampled a few things, all of which were very fresh. I was more than ready to start with the meats. Lots and lots of meats everywhere you looked. My favorites were the parmesan crusted pork and garlic beef. The servers were very kind, offering numerous times to go back for a different cut or cook of meat if we wanted. The sides were also good, loved the mashed potatoes and crispy polenta. I do wish they had bigger containers of the sides as they were quickly gone. I had a caipirinha in the spirit of things, which was a great drink. We ended the meal with dessert, the cheesecake was rich and delicious.   It is definitely a special occasion type of place, but I would absolutely recommend it to others and will keep it on my short list for when I win the lotto :)"}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant first time according to my friends. There are many beef barbecue. Salad bar is also delicious!"}
{"text":"A great time - exactly what you would expect from this type of place.  If you have been to a similar place, know that you won't get let down.  If you have not been, you should try a place like this.  They had a great variety of meats, and they will inundate you with them right after you sit down..."}
{"text":"We went with a party of 4 including my wife (Brazilian) to this place because of good experiences elsewhere (other Fogo's) and raving reviews on here.  Food-wise, its was great, I would give it 4 stars, however our waitress I'll give 2 stars, and here is why: Unfortunately we were dealt a very \"pushy and present\" waitress. For example, we asked for the Mango caipirinha, and she basically talked us out of it, saying it's not very popular, we should instead have the one with Amaretto but my wife said she didnt like Amaretto. So we asked for the original. Next, the waitress comes back with the one with Amaretto, saying \"I brought this one anyway, since I know you'll like it, you can not taste the Amaretto, and if you dont like it I'll bring you the other one\". Well, needless to say, my wife didnt like it, so we had to get her to bring the other one.   There were many more examples, like asking if a particular person wanted more wine while at the same time starting to pour it. Taking plates and dessert orders while one person was still finishing the meat. And at some point she was even dissing a meat server right behind us after he put the meat directly on the plate. The experience just became such that we tried to avoid at any cost to have the waitress come to our table for any thing.  Unfortunately, the waitress we had overshadowed the quality we think this place had."}
{"text":"Really good food. Salad bar is awesome and the bread is killer. Service was good (other than a major screw up by our waiter that I will explain below), and it was noisy but not overly so. Plus, we were sharing the dining room with the San Antonio Spurs (a perfect place to bring those big dudes!)  The meat was good, but not all cuts were equal in quality. My filet mignon was to die for, as was the lamb shank, but the sirloin was tough. That's really all I can comment of beef wise because it's all I tasted.   This leads me to my missing stars. I had gastric bypass 9 months ago, so I eat like a small child, sometimes less. We went to this restaurant because my husband wanted Brazilian BBQ for his bday, so I was aiming to please. I told the waiter about my restrictions and asked if there was a smaller portion option or another option all together. He informed me that they had unlimited sea bass as an option but that was it. That doesn't help me because \"unlimited\" will still be a waste of money when it comes to my stomach. Ok fine, I guess I'll just go with the beef. I was going to waste my money anyway. After we paid the bill, I said to my husband, \"I would come back if I could just do the salad bar. There is plenty of protein there and it satisfied me without needing the meat, and that way you could come for the meat and we would waste $51.50 on me.\" A nearby server overheard and said, \"Oh, you can do just salad bar, it's $28.99\" Really?! I asked for other options BEFORE the meal... I kinda feel like I was scammed out of my $22. Beef is hard to digest, so I literally ate 3 bites. They knew I had by always having my \"red coaster\" up while my husband was on \"green\" the whole time. So he knew I wasn't eating. The kind thing to do would have been to charge me a child's rate. The RIGHT thing to do would have been to answer me honestly when I asked for options since they weren't on the menu. Puts a really bitter taste in our mouths, and for that reason alone, we probably won't be back. All your waiter has to say was, \"Yes, there are options... We can't charge you for a child, but in addition to our sea bass, we have a salad bar only option.\" That's it. And for that you lost a customer. Kinda sad.   I realize that at a buffet there is only one option (which is why I only go to those when husband is in the mood, otherwise it doesn't make sense for me). But it is up front, and I know I'm throwing my money away by going. The difference here is that there apparently are options and when I nicely asked for the available options at Fogo, I wasn't given them until my bill was paid. That's bad business. :("}
{"text":"Came in with no reservation on a Tuesday night. It was busy, but we were seated right away. Soup/salad bar was well stocked and had a variety of food.  No one goes to a Brazilian steakhouse for salad though... Soon there were fantastic cuts of meat coming at us from all sides. It did not disappoint.  My friend, who had ordered a Maker's and Coke said it was good and strong.  Service was prompt and attentive.  Had to pump the brakes before we ate ourselves into assisted living.  A good experience.  My friend who had been there before had told me before we got there that they had very delicious mozzarella on the salad bar.  When we arrived, there was none.  After mentioning it to a manager, he was surprised it was not there, went to the back immediately, and returned with a full plate of mozzarella.  Great service!  SIde note:  A very obviously homeless guy that vaguely looked like a soot covered Tommy Chong managed to come in and seat himself at a random chair next to us. He must have ninja'd his way past the doorman and hostess.  A waiter and manager came over right away and calmly explained that he couldn't be there.  He left without incident.  They apologized to us profusely.  No harm, no foul."}
{"text":"What a great way to get introduced to Fogo De Chao  And I thought I would still be full this morning because of all the wonderful food I consumed last night.  (Sorry meal plan, but I had to break a couple rules last night...)  Food, service, atmosphere were all A+!!!!  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The salad bar is AMAZING!!!  And the tour of the kitchen and the private room was a great touch to end the evening.  Thank you Gabi for putting this together!  It was such an excellent treat!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4.5/5 Happiness 5/5  I am often too critical. So say my friends about movies and my wife about, a lot of stuff. But here's a place that I can't really find anything to complain about except myself (OVERATING ALERT is in effect here big time).  I love Brazilian steakhouses. For those that don't know what it is, its an all you can eat restaurant with salad bar (including soups, salads, cured meets, smoked salmon, various cheeses) shared sides for the table (potatoes, a cheesy bread, polenta, and mashed potatoes) and the STAR of the show - a variety of meats carved tableside. You turn a coaster to green and the meats keep coming in. You turn a coaster to red, the meats stop.   First, i LOVE the place. GIANT wooden doors. A huge room with beautiful tables. Literally an army of wait staff to serve you. I ordered a bottle of wine for the first time there recently and while mega-expensive (like wine at all restaurants), the servers were quick on the pour and didn't drop even a splosh on the white tablecloth (better than I can say for myself).  LUNCH is a great deal - you get almost the entire dinner menu for roughly half the cost. Just don't plan on eating dinner!  The salad bar alone is sumptuous enough, and I have had to learn not to fill up there beforehand since what I want is the stead, lamb and chicken (they also serve pork as well - I can't eat pork).   The one thing to know is that you need to be aggressive in asking for some of the meats. Notably, it takes a few tries to get the beef ribs and the lamb chops, both of which are absolutely worth the hassle to get them to bring out.   The only other thing to watch out for is the price - you get the bang for your buck, but the bucks accumulate VERY quickly here. Still I've never left unsatisfied, unless by my own hand when I've let myself become overstuffed!"}
{"text":"Drove up from Tucson to have a birthday dinner for my brother in law.  The food was excellent, although I was disappointed they didn't offer grilled pineapple.  We arrived before the rest of our party so we sat at the bar and the awesome bartender made us their signature drink, the Caipirinha, which was delicious and potent!  The drink was expensive out of Happy Hour, so if you plan to enjoy a few, happy Hour is your best time."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse for a long time. I took advantage of AZ restaurant week, made the reservations on Open Table at 7p.m. Saturday night. Plenty of parking, there was no need to use the valet. We were greeted right away when we arrived on time for our reservation. We were then handed a buzzer and told when our table was ready it will buzz and it wouldn't be long. We waited about 15 minutes.  As we walked to our table, we took note of a lot of large family parties, dates and small groups of tables. The restaurant was filled and loud. My only negative feel was that it felt like a land cruise ship dining room (food for the masses). We were seated at a perfect table for 2 against the wall. It was perfect because there weren't servers and people walking all around us to get to the Market Table (Salad Bar). Our waiter came over right away, explained how the variety of meats are served, Market Table and Sides included. Then he took our cocktail orders.   Now let the games begin! We had the Top Sirloin, Lamb Chops, Pork Ribs, Filet Mignon wrapped in Bacon, Pork Sausage, Sirloin, all requested at medium rare and we got it perfectly done. The Market Table and sides of Mash Potatoes, Cheesy Bread, Fried Plantain and Fried Polenta w/Parmesan Cheese all included and tasted very good. Dessert (I chose the Cheesecake) was part of the restaurant week deal, very OK.  Service was excellent! Cocktails excellent. Meats that we tried were excellent. Market Table and Sides were all very good. Dessert very OK and Atmosphere OK. Worth going for the experience."}
{"text":"Felt like royalty here! Freakin delicious! Expect to pay $5 per soft drink!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! You pay so much money to have a nice meal and they just give you cheese & salad bar, MEAT NEVER IS SERVE!!! we spend there 2 hours trying to get some nice meat and service was the worst, is I did eat 4 different types was it, besides, I order a drink they did bring a different one and told me it was ok they weren't going to charge it and they will bring the right one, 5 min later they come and ask me to take my glass because customer service guy told them I can't drinking if I won't pay for it (THEY MADE twice mistakes, first letting me keeping the drink telling me they won't charge it and then taking it from me because someone else told them too) so rude and unprofessional!! I'm very disappointed because we travel a lot and we have been in other great fogo de chao restaurants before. I'll never visit this one again 150$ bill for cheese and salad THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Pricey but good. It's like the meat-scapades. All the food is good, but I definitely prefer the filet mignon... some of the chicken and pork gets a bit dry. Fantastic salad bar. Wear stretchy pants. Dress stretchy pants."}
{"text":"Food is ok.. All of the meat are same taste to me. Except for the filet mignon steak. Salad bar small. But i love love the cheesebread! I love the chewy cheese inside of the bread yummmy"}
{"text":"We love Fogo de Chao! We come here regularly ever since they opened.  Conveniently located on E. Flamingo Rd, just west of  Paradise Rd.  Parking is never an issue, plenty of places to park. Also they provide valet parking for your convenience!  There is a nice bar area in the front before entering the restaurant. You can enjoy your favorite drink before lunch or dinner. Also, it's a unique viewing of the grilling of meats, with glasses around. A special way of making delicious food!  Love the authentic decorations! Modern with a twist of old! Dark wood carvings and leather seats.  Beautiful, fresh flowers all over the place. You can see trough the glasses of the walking vine cooler. Lots of vine to choose from!  The restaurant is divided into many different dining areas. It is convenient for business meetings, too!  Besides the original version of their dining experience, now individual items can be ordered. If you're not hungry enough to eat All You Can Eat meat and salad bar, it is optional to choose only the Market Table, for a lower price ... and also you can add one or two meat items. It is available for lunchtime, too! It's especially convenient, since the Market Table (salad bar) is $15 only. Plenty of vegetables, salads, fruits, cold meats, fish, cheeses, breads to choose from! Also, a delicious soup, too. Desserts and all drinks are for extra charge! (Sparkling water $7.50, other nonalcoholic beverages are $3.50)  The parmigiana cheese bread is so addicting! I can easily eat them all day! My friendly advice: please don't stuff your face with them if you want to enjoy the delicious meats! You're going to thank me later!  Also, don't forget to turn the round card (green for more meat; red for no more meat!)  Food and service are consistently awesome! We are going to enjoy many more delicious meals here!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten at one other Brazilian Steakhouse (two if you count the one in Israel...but it was a standard steakhouse...not the Brazilian model where they bring the meat to your table) and this one FAR exceeded the quality of the other. Every thing about it was top notch. Atmosphere...upscale and nice. Salad or food bar (I can't call it a salad bar because it was so much more) was stocked with high quality foods. But, the thing that you go to a Brazilian Steakhouse for is the meat....and the beef could not have been any better. Every cut was flavorful and tender. I just wish I had been hungrier. I went for lunch during their summer special and only paid $25 so at that price the value was excellent.  Only complaint...don't order a soft drink. They come in VERY small bottles (10 oz I think) and they charge $3 each."}
{"text":"Love this place, the meats were spectacular!!!  Having lived in Brazil, I wish the salad bar was more complete with Brazilian foods, but one can't complain when the meat is perfect. I also wish they had the pineapple and chicken hearts like some other restaurants have... But I still loved my visit!"}
{"text":"O.M.G. This place is AWESOME.  Initially one would say it's a carnivore's paradise, do NOT sleep on the salad bar.  Now I love me some cow and chicken just like the next person, but the salad bar is what it's all about for me.  I've eaten there three times over the past four months, and the one word that comes to mind: Consistency.  Fogo de Chao not only delivers the same great food time after time, they have EXCELLENT customer service.  Wanna know how good it is? My husband and I had a bit of a challenge transitioning our 6 month old son (now 8 months old) from the bottle onto other foods. On our first visit to Fogo de Chao, a relative offers up \"give him a lamb bone\"... so we do, and he LOVED it.  In fact, my husband had to fight the kid to get it back out of his hand (true story!).  If you are looking for a way to sample several cuts of meat while being fulfilled by an incredible salad bar, Fogo de Chao just might be the place for you.  Oh, and the desserts are amazing.  My ONLY gripe about this place is that they don't offer bottomless fountain drinks for the non-alcoholics like myself.  If you like Coke, Sprite, diet, etc, be prepared to pay $2.50 a pop (no pun intended) every time they bring one of those little 6oz bottles out to your table.  I guess they figure if you can pay big bucks for the dinner, what's a few more bucks for a soft drink?  My recommendation: come HUNGRY, or you will waste your hard-earned money."}
{"text":"Excellent is all I can say .  Loved it and definitely will come back.  Price is very reasonable compared to other fancy steak places.  Meat was well cooked and delicious.  Hint, go there hungry !! Also staff was great but way too accommodating -- tone it down a little, too many managers and assistant managers kept asking and asking and asking how was the food.  Let us eat in peace.  Enuf said."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday and I've got to say, we were a bit disappointed. I'm surprised by the high ratings. It's not that it was bad but it wasn't great either. The staff was friendly for the most part except for the first guy who came to offer meat. I had never been here and didn't know the tiny fork to my right was to hold the meat while he cut. So the first guy cut the meat and let it fall onto my plate and it almost hit my chest and my white top so that was a surprise. After the meat fell to the plate he told me to use the little fork next time....Mm-k-thanks. A lot of the meats were actually very dry and tasteless, only a couple were moist and flavorful. We loved the side dishes they brought by though, those were delicious. I couldn't get enough of the plantains. Their salad bar was pretty decent but there could have been more options. They were supposed to bring out a happy birthday dessert but no one ever showed up with it and my boyfriend wanted it to be a surprise so he didn't want to have to remind someone in front of me. We didn't want to be late to the comedy club so we left without getting it. Service was quite slow too, especially when we were done and needed to pay. We were on a time crunch so it got a little frustrating. Overall this place was ok but for the price you pay I would expect all the meats to be moist and full of flavor. I love the concept and it's a really fun idea but for that price I don't know that we'd be back. Maybe if we found a discount or coupon somewhere."}
{"text":"All you can eat meat.  A statement that makes my taste buds smile and my stomach frown.  Which is weird, because I didn't know my stomach was able to frown.  Fogo de Chão serves up 15 types of quality meats that include beef, chicken, sausuage, and lamb.  In all you can eat quantities.  I think Fogo de Chão is Brazilian for food coma.  For someone that doesn't really do the buffet or all you can eat thing very often (outside of sushi), it surprises me that I've been to Fogo five times since they've opened.  Three of those visits have been within the last month or so!  Everything here is very, very tasty.  I don't normally eat much pork or lamb, but here it is a requirement.  Leave your preferences at the door and be sure to give every dish a chance.  I'd like to tell you what my favorite dish is, but it seems to change with every visit.  Everything is consistently good; there are times where things have been amazing.  There have also been a couple visits where I felt that things were too salty, which is quite a statement coming from me since I'm normally not that sensitive to salt.  Outside of those instances, dining at Fogo will leave you with one of the happiest food coma's you can ask for.  I'm totally a fan!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for Restaurant Week which benefits our local food bank, Three Square; first the waiter decided to try talk us out of getting the Restaurant Week discounted menu and tried listing all the menu items we would not get.  We stuck to our guns; but the bad service continued.  We had to ask for our sides and extra rolls (which never came); after 15 min wait after all plates were cleared we had to ask for the dessert menu.    We have been to quite a few Brazilian steakhouses and found some of the meats under-seasoned. Overall the salad bar was good and the place had nice ambiance.  Oh and I am attaching a photo of how my coffee came out to finish my meal."}
{"text":"I recently had the worst experience here. I had a large amount of family flying into town to celebrate my uncle receiving an honorary doctorate at his Alma Mater. The culmination of the weekend was a surprise dinner for him at Fogo. As a professional event planner, I emailed the private dining salesperson (who was lovely) and together, we made the decision that sitting in the main dining room would be a better option for my group because we didn't want to be married to a minimum spending amount since my lovely 85 year old grandmother was treating. Although we did not get the private room, we were informed we could come early to set some menus and decor on the tables.  When I arrived to the restaurant at my reservation time, I was informed that my table wasn't available. What? I had made a reservation and my entire family was on the way. I peered into the private room and it was not occupied. So, a lovely hostess found the \"manager\" and asked him if we could use the private room. He gave me some schpeel about we can't because of a myriad of different bogus reasons and stalling and then my husband and I finally sorted through his BS to hear that another group would be coming in.   Okay, no worries- that makes sense. BUT Then, the \"manager\" proceeds to tell me he was actually lying and that there was no group in there tonight but he didn't want to give us the room because we are not \"his\" customers and had previously contacted the group sales manager (as one would). He said \"his\" customers can get the private room at any time with no minimum or anything. I said \"Great! We would love to be your customers, we are here now and will definitely have a bill of over $2,500. He said no once again because we aren't \"his\" customers.  What? Isn't everyone in the restaurant \"his\" customers? His pompous attitude and aggressive demeanor COMPLETELY ruined our night, had me fuming and my husband minutes away from going off on this pretentious snob. He continuously talked over me, insulted me and never once apologized. Congratulations Fogo on ruining a once in a lifetime event for my family and uncle."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, at least what was offered to us. What makes this only a 2 star review was the service. My husband, son, BFF & I went last night to celebrate my birthday. We were there from 6pm until 8pm and we only saw lamb chops once, half of the table was at the salad bar and never had a chance to have any. We never saw beef ribs, ribeye, or chicken breast. Beef filet made its was over one time, and we each were given a tiny sliver. The real disappointment was that since we were there celebrating my birthday, we indicated that on the reservation. My husband and my friend told 2 of the servers it was my birthday, and my 11 year old son went over and told the person at the host  stand also, and no one ever offered a birthday dessert until after the bill came and my friend made a stink about it. If you are coming here to celebrate something, don't. You can get a nicer meal and better service for a lot less. We were there for 2 hours, spent over $300 and were only offered half the items they tout on their website. Pretty disappointing. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I recommend a visit to a Brazilian Steakhouse - Fogo de Chao is a \"chain\" found throughout USA and they do a great job.  Here, they have a much better than average salad bar, and all the meat that you care to eat.  They have about a dozen different varieties and it's brought to your table.  The experience here is unique and very memorable - in a good way.  One of my favorite cuisines and restaurant chain."}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse. I love the ambiance. If you love steak, this is the place to be. The meat kept coming and coming... I love watching the servers go around with their meat selection! They also have a really nice selection at the salad bar. Not the usual salad bar, loved the grilled vegetables and all different types of chillies & cheese! The only reason, I gave it  4 stars instead of 5, was because the lamb chops were less frequent than any other meats! But the food was really good. We also had creme brulee and cheesecake as desert. Was to die for...I highly recommend this place as it offers great steaks  & it is a unique experience!"}
{"text":"I am late in reviewing this but still felt a need to voice off on what a fantastic evening I had. The food was amazing. There was a excellent salad bar with items such as mozzarella, roasted red peppers, salmon, asparagus, marinated mushrooms and all sorts of salads. One could honestly fill up on one circle of the salad bar, but I was careful to save room for the delicious meats.  The selection of meat was incredible, from what I can remember: bacon wrapped filet mignon, top sirloin, lamb chops and leg of lamb, chicken in garlic, sausage, pork ribs, bacon wrapped chicken and on and on. The sides were great too, crispy polenta, mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas.    What really made this night special was the amazing service. We were given a tour of the kitchen so we got to see how it was all prepared. Our server was also quick to make sure we were able to taste every meat selection they had, and to send the guys over had we requested more of a particular item.    This was a 5 star dining experience and I will definitely be back. Thanks Gabi!"}
{"text":"Two friends and I were there for lunch today and we were disappointed.  We had to wait for servers to come to the table. We also had to wait sometimes as long as ten minutes for items we requested like beef and pork ribs, rib eye steak, and lamb chops. The pork ribs were over cooked and when I told the server he said that this is how they are prepared in Brazil. I told him not true since I have been to Brazil two times and had very juicy, tender ribs.  I have been to this restaurant a few times, and this is the first time I feel like I was ripped off.  I will go back with the hope that it will be up to par. Maybe today was a bad day for them."}
{"text":"Heard all the praises for this place so decided to take my family for a visit. The service is awesome but the food is so-so, every once in a while a server would bring a huge piece of steak/ lamb to you and ask if you want a piece which will make you feel fed up after like 3 turns. The salad bar was terrible. Check came out to be $250 for 4 person and some drinks. The whole experience was kind of meh.. Perhaps because I expected more when reading the good reviews."}
{"text":"We were truly amazed at the wonderful food and service at Fogo de Chão. The buffet/salad bar was delish, the side dishes were amazing, the cheese-rolls were to die for, and the never ending stream of 12 meat choices, delivered and carved table-side, were fantastic. The meat was tender, flavorful, and delectable, and when I say never-ending, I'm not lying. This staff is a well-oiled machine here, as well as being super friendly and attentive. I can't say enough about our experience. I would go back in a heartbeat and highly recommend to others.   As a side note, I've got a gluten allergy, and all but 3 items on the menu were gluten free, including the cheese rolls. I was in heaven. Thanks, Fogo de Chão!"}
{"text":"What can I say ? Awesome -as always-this chain has got their stuff right and does it right every time"}
{"text":"The service was great and so was the food.  I especially liked that every meat was offered from rare to well done.  The seasoning was just right and all the meats i tried were nice and juicy.  As for the salad bar, no complaints here but I only tasted a few things.  The Fogo Caipirinha was delicious!! Make sure to come hungry."}
{"text":"OMG! I have no words to describe this place. Service, food, environment, and price, they were all the best! I worked with Sabrina to coordinate the whole event, and they did more than expected. I really have no words. My guests were more than pleased, they were full with great food and drinks."}
{"text":"come hungry!!"}
{"text":"Top class service. They probably don't have the best food in the area (I know it's pretty dumb to compare their steaks to Houston, Ruths Chris or Paul Martin because they are cooked differently but the info may be useful for some people), but their service is absolutely the best. The restaurant was full when we were here but there's nothing for us to complain about their services. The waiters replaced our dirty dishes every 10 minutes. They even refilled my water like 4 times when my water drop to 1/2. Unlike other restaurants where there's only 1 waiter responsible for your table, in Fogo, you can ask anyone anytime for your requests. When we asked to take our wine bottle home because we couldn't finish it. They put it in a bag for us and then seal it. VERY PROFESSIONAL."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao is a great place to go if your hungry! I call it the \"meat parade\" because they are constantly serving you meats of your choice. This location has a friendly staff and is well worth the visit. The salad bar is great too."}
{"text":"Fogo De Chao is about a mile off the strip behind Hard Rock...after eating here, I completely kick myself for not having discovered them sooner.  The dinner is $51.50 and completely worth it.  It was so good that I asked if they catered or sold their meat to go.  (Alas, they do not.)  The Hubs and I were on a mission to try it all and...we did.  My top choices in respective ranking:  #1: Tender lamb chops #2: Lombo - parmesan crusted pork loin #3: Picanha - garlic & sea salt sirloin #4: Linguica - pork sausages  The lamb chops were so tender and juicy with a salty savory seasoning.  The lombo had some nicely seared edges but the salty cheese encrusted on it was what won me over.  The picanha was aggressively garlicy but does not linger on the palate.  The linguica were plump and beautifully seasoned.  Yum!!  Meats that we could have skipped over were the Alcatra & Fraldinha which are the top & bottom sirloin.  Delicious but nothing spectacular.  Their salad bar is fresh & always stocked on a regular basis.  I loved the roasted & marinated veggies as a balance to all the meat.  Their complimentary sides were also amazing; smooth garlic mashed potatoes, carmelized bananas & super crunchy polenta fries.    The manager suggested we get one of each & share it...and then get more of what we liked.  Such a great tip!  Their amazing staff will go back into the kitchen & either get what you're looking for or tell the waiter who has it to come to you.   A solid 5 stars on the food, sides, salad bar, staff, efficiency & parking lot!  Definitely will be back!  :)"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, which, I think is the far better value, as the food is the same as dinner...just $20 cheaper.  First off - atmosphere and layout - very nice.   We were seated promptly, explained the process, and asked for drink orders.  BF had a back and forth with our server on the beer selection, ordered one the server recommended, and then...it never materialized.  It's very hard to flag a server in there, as once you're seated, you pretty much have the meat guys running the show, or, you go to the salad bar.  Anyhoo, we lost interest in it, and it didn't show up on the check, but still...serious fail to miss it, as again, they had a discussion over it.  To the food...all of the pork or chicken items were seriously dried out.  The ribs were unpalatable, the bacon-wrapped chicken was horrible. The beef were better choices, but not great.  We prefer our beef medium rare, though most of what came to the table was medium to well-done.  Some of the cuts were very bland, while others were strongly seasoned.  The salad bar...for all the ravings on here, I expected something fantastic.  It was OK.  The \"meats\" were the same you'd find pre-sliced at Safeway, the cheese selection had three choices, the veggies all looked very fresh, however.  The cheese bread they bring at the beginning was totally yummy.  Had about 4 of them myself.  lol  Overall, if you're looking to just eat copious amounts of meat, and you have little regard for quality and preparation, then you'll love this place just for the all-you-can-eat factor.  Otherwise, you'll likely be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was good but the lighting made it difficult to see me food, which strained my eyes. Customer service was pretty good. I was in my own little corner, a nice private area with friend and family"}
{"text":"Went for thanksgiving lunch/dinner. It was surprisingly really good. It was a cool concept and place. All the different meats were all really delicious."}
{"text":"good for lunch, big place so you can talk and do business lunch without everyone hearing you and its kind of dark and quiet, good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Been there multiple times last one being days ago. Service is always great. Every time we are very happy with service from the moment we walk in to the moment we leave. When it comes to food, this place is second to none in terms of Brazilian barbecue. They have the finest cuts and superb variety. Needless to say I'll come back again and again..."}
{"text":"The steakhouse was great, the service was spectacular! Vincent was the best server I've ever had"}
{"text":"We celebrated our friend's birthday here tonight. Food was delicious as always and our waiter Jr., was excellent and kept the amazing bread coming. Norma was also very kind and sweet to us. We will be dining here again for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent! The meats were well seasoned.  I tried the lamb leg and lamb chops.  I don't usually like lamb, but it wasn't too gamey for my tastebuds, therefore, the FIRST time I have ever liked eating lamb. The waiters were very cordial and gave us a very delightful first time experience to this restaurant. Delicious salad bar and complimentary desert.  All very good!"}
{"text":"This is a step above other local Brazilian Steakhouses. The service and quality was impeccable."}
{"text":"To celebrate my brothers recent promotion at work we decided to take him out for a nice dinner. Fogo was the first place my husband recommended. What man doesn't love steak!? This was my second time, my brothers and sister in laws first, and we couldn't have asked for a better experience.   The market bar was so tasty and the steak/sides were endless. The entire experience I would describe as pleasantly indulgent. My brother was impressed and grateful.   At Fogo everyone is your waiter. If you haven't been there before be sure to let them know so they may explain how it works. While the entire staff was great we cannot say enough about the exceptional service Steven provided. He typically works at the bar but stepped out to assist and we were lucky enough to get him!   Thank you Fogo and Steven for making the dinner so special!   My only regret - not taking any food pics! I guess I was just too mesmerized by the delicious food. ; )"}
{"text":"How do I say \"keep shoving meat into my mouth hole\" in Brazilian without it seeming like some sort of lewd innuendo? How can anyone not enjoy it here. Sure it's expensive, what do you expect with a never ending delivery and variety of perfectly seasoned meats. Not only that, for those meat connoisseur, you can even choose what part of the specific meat you would like to eat. And then let me drop this bomb on you. BACON. WRAPPED. FILET. As much as you can possibly put inside your body. A tip don't bother with the salad bar. Rookie mistake. Keep that gullet free and clear for only a meat landing. Yes. Forever yes. x1000. Marry me? No, be cool, we can only be friends with benefits Fogo....my girlfriend would never understand."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, Staff is friendly they start right away with the meat selections. Marco the assistant manager is the best. 10 stars"}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week.  First impressions, when walked in, there was a fire pit with cuts of meat rotating around it. I felt my inner primal caveman doing cartwheels. I knew it was going to be a good day!  The hostess was very cordial. The restaurant was beautiful. Very clean design with tall ceilings and very open floor plan.   It was a little pricey for lunch $30.12 but it was worth every penny.  I was worried about what my vegetarian GF was going to eat. Browsing the menu online, they offered a salad bar. Again, a little pricey  for lunch $19.95  I have to say, hands down, it was the best salad bar i have ever seen.  All of the food was delicious and the vegetables were very fresh.They also had some delicious cured meats, great cheeses including a whole wheel of Parmesiano Reggiano that was flaked into large chunks My GF was very impressed with all of the selections. She was happy, thus everyone was happy.  Now to the good stuff, aka the meat! As with Brazilian Steakhouses, you have a card that is green on one side and red on the other. Green means \"bring on the meat\" and red means \"not right now\". When i turned it to the green side, it was if the servers who were dressed in traditional Gaucho outfits came out of the wall with giant skewers loaded with deliciously fire roasted meat selections. All of the selections i tried were perfectly seasoned and cooked.The stand out were the lamb chops. My GF asked me if i needed some alone time as my eyes rolled int the back of my head after my first bite. I truly ate like a caveman pushing the carbs aside. Although I did have a spoonful of the mashed potatoes because they looked too good to pass up.  The dessert was included. I thought there would be no room for dessert but we both found our spare dessert stomachs. She had the creme brulee and it was decadent, rich and delicious. I had the strawberry creme which was topped with some Creme De Cassis.  It was delightful and very delish. Since it had strawberries in it, i was telling myself that it fresh fruit and good for me. That's my story and I am sticking to it!  The service is top notch. They had so much staff, when i pushed my plate aside, it was quickly whisked away and a new one was given to me just as fast.  Our waters and iced teas were kept full the whole time. The server was very knowledgeable and pleasant.   My GF told me I was going to go into a food coma when I got home and as usual, she was correct. I think I am still full and we ate there yesterday."}
{"text":"Great food and attentive staff! Would definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao has always been my first love (Brazilian Steakhouse). :)  This branch is phenomenal, because the place is well lit. Also, they don't skimp on my favorite beef rib!  They had new stuff on their menu that pleased my palate, especially the garlic picanha!    Would be a regular at this location!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant, bar none.  Discovered it first time in Baltimore in 2013. Since then it is our go to place for celebrations. Yesterday our son graduated ASU with his masters in engineering!  You know what they say, go big or go home. That's right we FOGO'd it!!  Our waiter, Claudio, was amazing.  Very attentive to our party of 8.  The food was amazing and the service top notch!!  Five star evening!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary on a Tuesday night. It was extremely busy so I'm glad we made a reservation. We still had to wait about 10 minutes upon arriving to be seated though. The salad bar had a variety of options such as fresh mozzarella cheese balls, prosciutto, assorted cheeses, Caesar salad, asparagus, soup, smoked salmon and capers, and  a lot more.   Save your stomach for all the meat though! There are many different people coming around with the fresh meat and ask you if you want any. They say it pretty fast and they are extremely quick so that was the only downside. You receive a little circular card on your table with one side signaling green \"yass give me meat\" or the other side is red meaning don't give me more. Haha.   The meat quality was delicious and my favorite was the house sirloin. It was so crispy on the outside and it paired well with the juice medium rare meat in the inside. I also really loved the lamb. I was pretty disappointed with the ribeye because I asked for medium rare and the guy that came over even said it was medium rare but it was very bland and on the well done side.   All the servers and staff seemed pretty stressed and the atmosphere was a bit hectic. But overall it was an okay experience. The food was good for the most part. For the two of us it came out to $130. I probably wouldn't ever come back again knowing there's some other spots in Vegas to get a similar experience for half the price."}
{"text":"I came to this place 4 Times. Yesterday, I decided this will be my last time. Low quality, unprofessional waiters and bad service. 1- low quality service, when I pay money I expect good service  2- the waiter dropped the food on my wife, he did not help even. He ran away like if nothing happened 3- the waiter dropped the bill, he did not pick it up  4- there was additional item on the bill, the waiter waited to see if I will check, then he said ooh sir , I am not sure, but did you order this item?  I go to this place just for the experience, if the experience is not good any more what else I will for.  Unfortunately, I had two foreign people from Spain yesterday, I liked to show them this place, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Restaurant exceeded expectations and hands down is better than the food, options, and service I've received at other Brazilian steakhouse locations in Pittsburgh.  In talking with my server I found that they have 17 different cuts of USDA choice chicken, lamb, pork and beef that is shipped in consistently, never frozen. The market table is huge with a variety of veggies, fruits, rice, beans, meats & cheeses, smoked salmon, etc. I was shocked to find the location is not only healthy but 99% gluten free.  The service and food were beyond impressive, I had no wait and was greeted with lots of smiles (we know that's not always common in Pittsburgh). If asked if you want to try a cocktail, you must! Best drinks I've had in awhile, the Brazilian caiperina was so tasty.  I will be bringing my very large family next time. It looked like they have multiple private & semi-private spaces to book that would be nice for a large group."}
{"text":"Let me preface with saying that I am a meat lover and have loved multiple years in Latin America. I have been here multiple times and have brought multiple friends here and we are never disappointed. I would recommend going for lunch for two reasons. One it is cheaper and two it gives you time to digest before going to sleep and falling into a food coma. The waiters come around with large skewers of meat and you choose which cuts of meat you want. One of my favorites is the picaña. They also have this amazing cheesy bread. There is a salad bar but to be honest I don't even waste my time with that."}
{"text":"For a hefty meat eater, you'll enjoy the experience.  The red/green cards are like a polite way of snapping your fingers.  When you're green side up it's like screaming \"Meat!  Bring meat now!\"    Servers arrive with skewered meats (rare, medium, well) and you get to choose where they slice, using your tongs to grab hold of it.  I believe they had 16 different meats and/or cuts but take care not to miss one by following the picture pamphlet they give to first timers.  There are plentiful refills on cheese rolls, sauteed bananas, and fried polenta.  If you're not heavily into meat, then you'll want to make use of these free refills.  The salad bar wasn't as widely stocked with veggies as I wanted.  It was lacking in that area.    Given that I went during lunch, we'll assume dinner time salad bar selections are much more plentiful.  But for the price, it would have to be twice as good.  For me to give 5 stars, FdC would need to improve the veggie selections and offer dessert in the price."}
{"text":"I just recently went here with a group of family and friends. It was a phenomenal experience. The service was excellent, the presentation was beautiful and the food was just superb!  The appetizer and finger food before you start your meal were delicious with no complaints! I loved the smoked salmon! I could eat that all day if I could! There were many varieties of meat that were just so mouth watering and tender. A few examples of these meat were Filet Mignon, Top and Bottom sirloin, Rib Eye, Pork Ribs, and Lamb. To think this is all you can eat as well, you can't go wrong with that! I indulged until I couldn't anymore. I mean when can you have this opportunity to keep eating these dishes with a flat rate of ONLY $40.  The wine was wonderful as well. I got a nice glass of red wine to enjoy with my meat and couldn't find any complaints but enjoyments! The bar also carries a bottle of Louis the XIII!! Now that's the second time I seen the bottle, the first being in Las Vegas, NV.   I would definitely come here again and recommend this to a friend to try!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but a big fat MEH! I would never, never, ever, ever, pay $120 for a sirloin steak dinner, which is exactly what we got. It became a joke between me and my husband--seriously, every meat that came by was sirloin. Oh, and there was some dry chicken. And a really chewy bacon-wrapped filet (once). By the time we finished eating, we saw that there was a pork chop, some lamb, and some sausages floating around, but we were done. We sat there for over an hour and none of those meats ever made it to our table. How is that even possible?  They have a decent salad bar, but it's pretty limited, and the ranch dressing tastes like Hidden Valley. Nasty. I wish I had gone to Talking Stick, or Jasmine Palace, or even freaking Sweet Tomatoes for what I paid at Fogo de Chao! Also, the meat all had a strong gas taste, which was really unappetizing. So completely disappointing. I wouldn't go back unless it was free, much less pay what I did."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?  Decor, Food, Wait Staff... Loved it!    We were a party of six with reservations for 8:00 am on a Friday night.  It was the first time for all of us and I swear we had the \"deer in headlights\" look on our faces.  We were given instruction by our first waiter that the staff works as a team and are not assigned to specific tables.  However, he was a bit stiff and when we asked him a question, he responded with \"as I said before....\" Needless to say, we didn't call him back to help us.  We were fortunate to flag down Junior!  Wow!  So personable and quick with requests!  He made sure we had everything we needed.  It seems like we weren't the only ones Junior made an impression on because other tables kept calling him over!  LOL    The food was so perfectly done no matter what our preference was (rare, medium well, well done...).  The salad bar was so abundant.  We had to be careful not to fill up before we had our actual dinner.  We lucked out that they were having their Summer Special which was $45 per person and included dessert (try their Tres Leches cake!) Sides were also good and you can ask for more.    Even though you had to roll us out of there...  ;-) We will ALL definitely be coming back and we will definitely be asking for Junior!  He made the experience that much more memorable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what there is to say about this place. Concept is awesome meats are awesome my fav is the rib eye, lamb chops and filet. But the others are delish too. Sides are all good. Limeade yummy. Service always good. It's pricey but worth it. I've been here at least three or four times and never have I been disappointed. If you want delicious beef or chicken this is it. You will leave satisfied and thinking of when you wanna go again. It's great for a date or large groups. Lunch or dinner..."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! I just wish the servers would smile a little bit more. But pulling my chair out was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for lunch and had an outstanding experience.  We arrived 10 mins before opening and they were gracious enough to seat us right away.  The salad bar was outstanding (don't fill up) and everything was extremely fresh.  Then came the endless parade of meat.  The variety was impressive and they managed to get almost everything the correct temperature.  Make sure to order the lamb chops, they were great.  Service was outstanding, water and teas never getting lower than 1/2 full.  A bit on the pricey side, but well worth it."}
{"text":"If you are salt conscious I wouldn't suggest to go to this restaurant. My dad is on a strict low sodium diet but they were gracious enough to cook his meat without the salt. The food is amazing and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"For $120 you get exactly what you pay for, A LOT OF FOOD. was the place really that good? No, it wasn't a blow away experience. The food quality was just eh.... I'm not coming back here. It was just an itch I had to scratch since I've never been here before, The meats were very good. Pro tip - don't get much from the salad bar, just get all the meats since that's you're really paying for."}
{"text":"Everything is first rate about Fogo. Wine list is extensive, service is great, salad bar is fresh although not as great a variety as Texas De Brazil down the road at Town Square. Meats were good, not as many kinds as TDBrazil. We stayed through delicious key lime pie and coffee. Expensive for five mostly diminutive people who didn't eat a lot of meat, but oh so satisfying. Good food, great time."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 5 star rating because the waitress Amanda is great she was very attentive and the servers that bring out the several different types of meat on the skewers were nice and they brought over different types not just a few.  Everything is well organized and everyone here is great.  If you do come here I hope you get the chance to meet Ricardo."}
{"text":"Meat eaters paradise. Been to numerous brazilian restaurants and this chain is the best. Food quality is top notch. Salad bar is also high quality. Servers are always bringing stuff you like. Price is alittle pricey, but its still cheaper or cost the same as most buffets in Vegas"}
{"text":"okay, let me tell you about Fogo De Chão, this Brazilian Stakehouse is the best piece of meat I ever put in my mouth. OMG this place is beyond delicious. Me and my friends ate here for lunch on Monday 1/18 for my birthday. We were all amazed on how delicious the food was, they also have a great salad bar.  I dont know about everyone else, but i will defiantly be back to eat here at Fogo De Chão.  FYI: The host and staff were great and friendly.  also keep in mind they charge per bottle for coke products, my friend found that out when he got his bill for drinking 4 cokes lol....   Note*  1st time eating here, try out the lunch hour because it is decently price for about $30 a person, dinner goes about $50 a person, but it is worth ever dime for unlimited choices of meats that came around our table during the entire time we were there..  :-)"}
{"text":"It took two days to recover from what I did to myself at this restaurant! The food was amazing and cooked perfectly! I loved the beer selection they offered me. I had a Brazilian light beer which was heaven. My favourite meat by far was the filet mignon cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"This place is a must have if you are in Vegas !!! It's just off the strip on Flamingo. The fresh grilled meat selection includes Filet Mignon, juicy rib eye, lamb chops, and a barrage of perfectly cooked, right off the grill meats ! The salad bar had a beautiful appeal on the eye, offering fresh crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, peppers, tabouli salad, potato salad cheeses, roasted red potatoes and much more ! Great place to go for a nice romantic dinner or bring a large group. If you love meats, you absolutely have to come here ! And as a special bonus, the service was 5 Stars as well. The wait staff and \"Gouchos\" were so helpful and  attentive to my family we wanted for nothing. Our drinks were always full and every request was fulfilled quickly, with enthusiasm and a smile. I highly recommend visiting while in Vegas !"}
{"text":"if u can afford this food than you know why most people have given this place five stars i also went to the one in Austin Texas OMG!! sooo good i will and have already returned to this place many times"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place unless u like over cooked dry meat . services were great ,but I don't believe the chief cares ,maybe it's just me who knows what food should be."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to eat, drink, and hang out with friends. All meat cook at the best and delicious. The service is great too. Definitely will go back again!!"}
{"text":"They have the absolute best salad I've ever tried. It has EVERYTHING! I would go there just for the salad bar! And the presentation is so grand! The meats were pretty good. I like the fact that you can choose a piece if meat cooked anyway you like and the chimichurri is so good. My glands are salivating just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Back again for a business dinner last night. As usual the service was great.. the food was great..  I was able to try some of the request only side dishes this time.  farofa: A type of seasoned toasted flour. I believe their version was yucca flour. Think of this as seasoned bread crumbs. It was good on the various side dishes and some of the salad bar offerings.  Rice: Almost a pilaf style rice with very heavy chicken stock/butter flavor.  Black Beans: Delicious! Very creamy and filled with some type of smoked pork. Probably ham hocks. Wish I had some more right now.  Grilled Onions/Jalapenos: Can't remember what this was called. I had no idea this one existed but our server asked if I wanted to try it after requesting the other off menu side dishes.  11 of us had a whopping bill of $860 YOUCH! Glad I wasn't picking up that tab.  On a side note I was people watching while taking a meat break and who did I notice two tables down? The valleys very own Aaron May. This is where I was self labeled as a true foodie. I was very excited about this and everyone else at the table was just blankly staring at me."}
{"text":"I took my man out to eat here for a late anniversary dinner and WOW! Incredibly delicious meats, sides and salad bar! We dove straight into the meats though we were not wasting any time! I think my personal favorites were the sirloin and pork! However, I did try a little of everything which also delicious too don't get me wrong. Service tonight was spectacular! And dessert was to die for!!! Our server William suggested the Tres Leches Cake...O to the M to the G!! BEST CAKE we have ever tasted in our lives!!! Overall, it was a great experience for us first timers and the ambiance was quite amazing. Nothing but great things to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to go! it has a good selection of meats, the only thing I didn't like was that you only get 3 options of sides, Texas de Brazil and other churrascarias offer at least 10 different sides for you to choose. Service was good, I made a reservation and still had to wait about 15 min for them to have it ready which I didn't like but overall great experience"}
{"text":"Lunch is $34.95 and dinner $52.95 for the full experience. To me, hitting the lunch hrs is the best bang for the buck! They do have a small bar that serves some exclusive drinks, but most of my time the two times i've been here have spent devouring blue cut, and rare steak, slice after slice.   It's very salty, very addictive, and makes you want to just push through your said human bodily limits, arbitrarily demolishing everything they toss your way. I dont stop them from bringing out the tasty morsels, until I truly need a break from the carnivorous cravings.   I tried some salad,  some desserts which I'm pretty sure cost extra if I remember correctly. I felt pretty-kewl flipping my table medallion back to on after I was mentally prepared for yet another aggressive assault by the staff of the various select choices of lamb and beef.   Check the special of the day, sometimes they offer 2 for 1 wine bottles!  out of 5, go check it out for yourself if you're in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Starting with salad  bar followed by exceptional quality beef cuts, from house specials, every possible prime cuts of beef to perfect filet mignon and finally ending with quality desert and very good espresso, this stake house is on par with best in Las Vegas. This is 'table d'hôte' facility  and price is $50.00 + per person (vine, deserts and coffee are not included in price) but it worthy every penny you will spend. Indeed it is \"As good as it gets\"."}
{"text":"Been to multiple brazilian style steak houses in Las Vegas. The food here was great, salad bar was fenomminal, but what puts this steak house above the others is the service. Super friendly servers, my cup was never empty, plate was never left dirty, and plate was never empty. The cherry on the top was the manager, Chris. This guy was great, asked multiple times if we were ok and definitely went out of the way to make our experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Fogo in Vegas since it opened, anytime I'm in town on business.  Ricardo and the staff there do a wonderful job on everything, from restaurant cleanliness, to service, to food.  And what's not to like?    It's a meat lovers paradise, with cut off meat being continually delivered to your table.  And for the vegetarians, which, I didn't realize I was taking a few off you on occasion.  They have a salad bar to die for!  The smoked salmon is out of this world!  Every client I've brought to Fogo has been turned into it ever since!  Not cheap, but the experience is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambience here. The layout is welcoming and the staff is polite. They cater to most languages here as I sat at a table of 3 languages. I was with a Brazilian with a terrific taste for quality preparation and they met all his hopes. I was impressed with just about every selection I had and their medium was actually medium. Try everything here you will not be disappointed.   Also if you have the room, their tres leche cake is fabulous!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday and was anxious to see how this dining experience would be.  Overall the experience was just ok. The food was good but the service is definitely lacking. It may be because they just opened but I do hope it gets better.   I will speak about the food first.   The salad bar was pretty good but I didn't want to get filled up on that so I only went up once. The meat was really good. I have to say I enjoyed the lamb chops the most. I could have had that the whole meal and been pretty satisfied.   As I noted previously the service could have been better.   As you may or may not know to be served at Fogo you are given a chip. You turn it up facing green to be served and turned down facing red to not be served. The people serving seemed to do a good job coming around at the beginning of our meal but towards the end even if people at our table had the green chip turned up they wouldn't come around to serve us.  Our waiter also disappeared half way through our meal and never came back. Usually when servers leave for the night they announce this to the table and let the table know who the replacement server was but this never happened. This made it very confusing towards the end of the meal.   When we first arrived we told the hostess that we were there for a birthday and thought this would be conveyed to the waiter so he could assist us with a birthday dessert. This did not happen so in the mist of wondering where our waiter was and waiting on dessert we were left in limbo. When we asked another server when we would be asked about dessert we were given the response that they were waiting for us to tell them what we wanted for dessert. Since we were never given a dessert menu this would have been hard to do. At this time we conveyed again that it was a birthday and they final brought over a birthday tres de leche cake.   This cake was very good I must say.   I'm not sure if it was because we were there towards the end of the night (we left at 9pm an hour before close) or if it is because this newly opened but I feel the service should have been better. I don't think I'd come back again and if I did I would wait a little while for the service to improve."}
{"text":"Ok, what to say that everyone else hasn't already said...  Found this place by accident.  I've been to many, many Brazilian steak houses and they all have one thing in common -- they are slow.  Every few minutes someone comes by with something new, which is cool, but you get full pretty quickly and then you're done.    Not here.  Here you get an avalanche of perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned meat.  Honestly, the salad bar is epic, but why waste the stomach space?  Go for the meat.  You will not be sorry.  I'm going there again tomorrow night for my anniversary and I can't wait.  Neither can she :)"}
{"text":"This place gave me totally mixed feelings. Mostly I have good things to say. The food was good but the lack of a fifth star is mostly because it wasn't worth the price. I spend a lot of money on food and I don't feel like I'm being cheap here. Everything was cooked well, you can eat your fill. Lots of variety of meats. But when I pay a check for 170.00 I feel like I should have an experience and not just be full. I have eaten at similar Brazilian style Bbq places and the prices were simply better. I'll give it this . The atmosphere was better. Very classy place. Staff was courteous and attentive and the food did taste pretty good. Then again it is Scottsdale. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I am only giving three stars because unfortunately we already have gone to Texas de Brazil. I am not sure the history of both but we prefer Texas De Brazil (TDB)hands down. The servers are not that professional. The food it meh compared to TDB. There is not a lot of variety at the salad bar. The server had no idea about the wine list...he just pointed to a $250 bottle! To be brutely honest I would prefer TDB if I wanted to try a Brazilian steak house. The decor and environment at Fogo feels like your in a casino buffet dining room. Its loud ,especially with the servers yelling at each other right at your table. Fogo is good for getting you seated quick , getting your food quick and ordering expensive wine and getting you out the door QUICK! i felt rushed  having three servers ask if they can take our plates for us and clearing our table when we weren't even done our wine. Ahh well I guess paying $50.00 pp is cheap in VEGAS? lol If you want to spend this money and have a way better meal and experience, head to Texas De Brazil. Its  little further from the strip, though it is so well worth it."}
{"text":"Been to quite a few BBBQs. Fogo de Chao is by far the superior by far. The wait service is excellent / top notch. The buffet selections are numerous and high quality. I loved the fact that the plantains and fried polenta were automatically served to your table. Other pleasantries were special dishes being offered at the table along with offerings of special cocktails.Also that the  the servers were offering so many cuts of beef and not so much chicken and sausage. Btw.......best shrimp cocktail ever!!!"}
{"text":"Over the years this Fogo de Chao has changed in a few ways, including correcting the problem that caused me to downgrade them previously.  The servers are no longer acting harassed and no longer communicating a \"hurry up, get out of here\" vibe to customers.  It's still expensive but now you leave feeling that it was worth it - for a celebration.  For more frequent visits, well, it's still expensive and not a great value."}
{"text":"Three words can pretty much sum up our visit, Delicious meat coma. The sides were pretty tasty too!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch.   They serve lamb during brunch which is great because not all of these type of restaurants do so. The lamb chops were our favorite!  Excellent service."}
{"text":"In the great battle of who is better... Fogo vs. Texas... I vote Texas De Brazil... Here is how the battle panned out:  -Reservations: we made ours for 9pm on the Monday before Christmas with ease.. Both restaurants are a winner in this category... TIE -Ambiance: for $50/per person (before tip & without dranks) you expect a nice dinner... not gourmet, but nice. Fogo's atmosphere was not as impressive as TDB's warm colors, tapestries and large open rooms. TEXAS -Salad Bar: My favorite part of the Brazilian barbecue experience is the salad bar... Fogo's was ok but only if that was the only Brazilian barbecue that you've ever been to.. They had limited and not very impressive selections. TDB has way better cheese selection, more fresh looking ingredients and lobster bisque...yumm.. I also found myself wanting to go for seconds at TDB and not Fogo... TEXAS -Cocktail Bar/Wine List: We perused the wine & cocktail list at Fogo for quite a long time but couldn't find anything that caught or eyes... I feel that at TDB they have a way better and larger selection... TEXAS -Cheese Puff Bread: I love those little cheese puffs so much that I even attempted to make them at home but i feel like the ones that i made tastes better than Fogo's... At TDB I have to stop myself from filling up on those addicting little suckers... TEXAS -Meat: I am not much of a meat person but I found that I have been eating much more of it as of late... At Fogo I really appreciated how they would cook up a fresh batch of meat and bring it straight to your table if they did not have it circulating on the floor.. and not just the specific meat but the specific meat to the way you wanted it cooked. I feel as though the meat at TDB can sometimes be a tad bit salty for my palette..  I would score this category as a tie but the last selection of meat that Fogo brought out, freshly grilled lamb chops, was divine... not too gamey and perfectly cooked.... FOGO -Service: was great at both places.... TIE  *So you can decide for yourselves but if I had to choose again which place to go to I would definitely choose Texas De Brazil.    HOT TIP: The napkins in the bathroom at Fogo are just as wonderful as the napkins at TDB... if you know what I'm talking about... LOL"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch for my brother's b-day. We started off with a plate of salad. The salad bar had all sorts of different things like salami, cheese, prosciutto, salads etc. It was good and something light to eat before we chowed down on the meat!   For those of you that have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you should definitely try it out! It's definitely a great experience and it's an all you can eat restaurant! There's a little card that has the color green on one side and red on the other. Whenever you want the guys to come around with the different kinds of meat to your table, then you want the card to be on the green side.   So The guys come around to your table and they ask you \"how you do like your meats prepared\". Based on how you like it cooked, they slice a portion of it and you grab it with your tongs that's been provided at your table.   I didn't give them 4 or 5 stars because of their meats. I've been here once before which was amazing, but for some reason today it wasn't so great. I believe they have ten different kinds of meats and I swear pretty much all of them were overcooked. Some of the meats were dry and super salty because of the seasoning. Before I loved how most of the red meats tasted, but today I couldn't finish most of them and only stuck to one.   The appetizers that were brought to our table were mash potatoes, polenta, cheese bread, sugared bananas, which were okay. My favorite dish out of all of them would have to be the mash potatoes because they blended it so well! It was smooth, kinda like a puréed food.  The service was great like always and since it was my brothers bday we got the papaya cream. The papaya cream is one of their signature dessert and it's basically papaya and vanilla ice cream blended together. It's good and light!"}
{"text":"I have been to Fogo De Chao 2 times for lunch and what a treat. The wait staff is just awesdome and they make the whole dinning experience a treasure to be had, The salad bar is a notch above as is all the meat. The only problem you will have when you go there is running out of room before your taste bud want to stop. Going for lunch is less expensive and at dinner time. I highly recommend it for the really special occasion or when you want to impress someone. Great place for a business lunch. This is the only Brazilian BBQ in town worth going to.  Myrna/Amber Unicorn Books"}
{"text":"The service was horrible...I've been to this restaurant before and I truly enjoyed it but when I came back for fathers days brunch it just seems like  the staff didn't care..we couldn't get a refill and everything took forever and the waiter had an attitude when I ask for helped cause the one assigned to us disappeared...I probably won't be back and rather go to Texas de Brazil instead same price but better service."}
{"text":"I still like this place quite a bit.   Easy parking Always space Nice staff Great food overall  I am rating this a three this time as an update.   Twice I have been here and they seat is at the door of the toilet and kitchen. TWICE!  That is the noisiest place to be and were there for a business meeting party if none!  The table was nearly too small.   I would have complained and had us moved but I was a guest and not the paying person so I did not make a scene.   I did quietly speak to the manager. No real answer. And it was only 30% full when we were seated and 60% full when we left.   But alas. They no longer serve the wheel of gran padano cheese. Said something about it being in the open and not healthy as everyone can touch it. Ummm the entire salad bar is the same....  Still a great place. But average excuses!"}
{"text":"Top notch churrascuria, but exceptionally expensive. Flank steak and garlic steak are to die for and the house spicy sirloin is amazing. The buffet of accompaniments is outstanding and fresh and their caipirinhas (think Brazilian mojitos) are outstanding but $15 a pop. The waitstaff were outstanding. One downside is they are about a mile from the actual strip. For over 50 bucks a piece, it better be good. It was, but not sure I would rush back there since it was a 40 minute bus ride from downtown. Apart from the cost, the meal was outstanding."}
{"text":"My wife (Brazilian) and I give this 5 stars and in a bullet fashion...here is why.  Valet parking - sorry folks, if I'm going to kick up a hundo for a meal for my wife and I, this is to be somewhat special and elegant.  Kudos for the valet parking especially considering my wife was wearing 5\" heels so she appreciated me springing for it.  Not sure what my old man's problem was that he was too cheap to do it and he walked with his wife for 10 minutes to get to the front door.  This was on a Saturday night mind you.  Cordial - From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted and taken care of without having to ask if they forgot us.  We had our 14 month old with us and we were trying to get a picture of the three of us so the hostess rushed over and snapped a photo of us.  Food - My dad and I are carnivores but he did nail down some seafood at the salad bar.  The apple-chicken salad was awesome and the ladies enjoyed just about every facet of the salad bar.  Let's just say there was parmesan everywhere!  As for the main course, the rodizio was as good as it gets.  My old man and I nailed down as much meat as the intestines would handle.  If you haven't done Brazilian rodizio before, nearly everything is seasoned with rock salt.  Many of the cuts were being brought on two skewers, one more on the rare side and one more well done.  I like my meat to the rare side and the flavor was incredible.  Restaurants like this make you wish you had a bottomless pit.  Meat lovers, please visit SOON!  Service - This is a key again for me.  I have no tolerance for paying for a meal, let alone one this expensive, and being treated like I never walked in the door.  Honestly, I can cook up a good meal and serve myself and save the complaints and the excessive $$$ if necessary.  Fogo did not disappoint one bit.  The servers were very friendly, on top of the table constantly...not one mistake in anyone's drink...even kept my little guy's apple juice full.  One thing we really liked is that there was one individual who was hitting the tables asking what types of meat we were waiting for specifically, not only did he remember...we soon had the meats we preferred flowing to the table faster than we could devour them...definitely pleased with this extra attention to detail.  Only two things that weren't positive and I wouldn't say they were a negative by any means...in fact if they didn't happen, this would have been a 6 out of 5 rating from us.  First, my dad and his wife shared the Flan from the dessert menu and claimed it wasn't as \"light\" as it should be.  Honestly, how in the heck did he have room for dessert in the first place?     And the last item on my soapbox is one I'm sure a few in Phoenix complain about but it's hard to get the restaurants to enforce.  I'm originally from the midwest and we dress up to go to Applebees so folks, please don't come to a restaurant like this dressed in your damn basketball shorts.  We were there on a Saturday night and fortunately most of the Scottsdale folk dressed adequately for the occasion but there were some exceptions.  Honestly I think this place is busy enough that they should be more strict with the dress.  My dad lives in Paradise Valley not far from the place but my wife and I made the trek up from Maricopa to enjoy this cuisine and we WILL BE BACK!   Fogo, thank you for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I came to this place for my birthday celebration with my fiance and another couple. I was definitely in a good mood.  THE FOOD  First, the salad bar. I am not much of a veggie lover, but the selection here is impressive, especially in light of this being a place where you eat the cow, not the cow's food. Besides a variety of veggies and dressings, you have a few cold cut meats, cheeses and smoked salmon to select from. From personal experience, tomatoes are good, all cheeses and meats are too. Salmon was simply delicious.  For the main course, it's all sorts of meat, mostly varieties of beef plus lamb and chicken. I liked all of them, but most of the beef was a salty to my taste (hence the loss of a star). Some of it can be explained by my getting the first cut off the meat several times, which meant that I got the salt seasoning in addition to the salt in the meat.  That aside, the meat is high quality and the main objective here is to remember not to get too much too soon, so you can enjoy everything the place has to offer.  Sides were small (as they should be) and included polenta, mashed potatoes and fried bananas. All good.  The wine selection is extensive and from our limited tasting, quite good. We had Cabernet and malbec.  SETTING This is a rather large stand alone restaurant, but has surprisingly personal feeling, especially if you consider the amount of staff running around. It is not too brightly lit and has generally darker tones to the interior. There is also a cozy bar to the side of the main entrance that is a pleasant place to wait for others to arrive.  SERVICE Attentive and not at all pushy.  OVERALL I came here in a good mood and left in an even better mood and feeling like a python after eating a cow. Which was close enough to true amount of food in me. Highly recommend this both for the experience and the food itself."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great food and got free dessert as they participated in restaurant week!  The food kept coming as much as we wanted and cooked/seasoned perfectly!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at one of these Brazilian Churrascarias which there are several of in Vegas now.    I do have somewhat of a mixed feelings about this kind of eating as I do with many buffets in Las Vegas.  Basically, this is a huge steak buffet where you don't have to get off your seat as they bring it to you.  I actually liked the salad bar.  It has a good selection of cold cuts, cheese, and other cold things to pick from that were of good quality.  Just don't fill up on this stuff as flood of meats is coming.    I think I pretty much tried everything except for some chickens as I'm more of a red meat person rather than white meat.    I would say that the quality of the meat is pretty good, and what you can't experience in regular steakhouses that you can here, is that you can taste about 6, 7 different cuts of meat at one setting.    The huge problem I have with this, is that for those of us who prefer to eat our meat medium rare to rare, this type of serving meat makes this very difficult.  What they do is shave a piece off of a large piece on a skewer, so it is impossible to get a thick piece of meat cooked to your liking.  There were some cuts like filet where they do give you a large chunk, but it seemed that these were all overcooked, even though I asked for medium rare.    After a while I was going into redmeat coma and it really didn't matter what I was eating.  This is the problem with buffets.  There is just too much food to a point that I start losing focus, and you just can't \"feel\" that the chef is putting everything on the line to give it his/her best, because they just have to keep the food going out.    If you are a 22 year-old who want to load up on decent meat at buffet prices, then this might be great, but for those of us who are used to quality \"steaks\" in this town, it doesn't quite do it. I fortunately did NOT have to pay for this meal, but for $47 or so per person, I can't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Food is super good    Service is way better  Over the top    I must say this has the best service out of all restaurants I ever ate at in Arizona by far  Staff and management 5 stars alone   Choices of meats are very good at this location also"}
{"text":"Our family had a nice lunch, very nice restaurant. The meat and salad were excellent! It was a pleasant experience. It can be casual at lunch and dressy at dinner. The waiters and the staff are super helpful. We well be back again!"}
{"text":"What better way to learn the anatomy of a cow than through eating it...rodizio style!  I've now been to 4 of the 19 US locations and I would say this one is right on par with the rest of them i've been to.  What do I love about Fogo de Chao?  The quality of meat is excellent compared to many of the other chains.  I consider Texas de Brazil the only competition when it comes to meat quality and flavor.  The service is always impeccable and you never have to wait long for gauchos to make their rounds.  I've also had multiple occasions where the gaucho serving the filet mignon gives generous portions, which quite frankly pays for the meal in itself!  The salad bar could be much improved in my opinion, but I hardly waste any time there so I won't waste my time complaining about it.  The scalloped potatoes are delicious, though...but carbs are AYCE killers!  Every table is served fried polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas, and the famous cheese balls.  The cheese balls are doughnut hole sized pillows of cheesy doughy goodness, but again...carbs!    My dad and I love to save the bananas for our dessert.  Seriously though, give me one plate of those bananas, a scoop of Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream,  and a bed to nap in after I enter my food coma and that's what heaven must be like!  My favorite cuts: -Filet Mignon...duh -Picanha, the house specialty -Ribeye -Top sirloin -Leg of lamb"}
{"text":"Great service for our table of 7 on a saturday evening. The high light was there salad bar without a doubt. The waiters were always offering their meat fairs until you turned over your chip to the red stop side. My problem was very simply that all of the meats were extremely over salted. If you are avoiding salt I suggest you avoid this restaurant.  The prices did not warrant the sub par quality. As for myself this was my second time there.... The first and last time.. My own bill including dessert and tip was $70.00"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had been talking about going here for months, just had never found the time to make it out.  Last night, I took her and her parents out to dinner here to celebrate her birthday.  Needless to say, this place did not disappoint in the least.  If I had anything to complain about, it didn't have anything to do with the restaurant, staff, food or experience.  It had to do with the fact that their meats were so good that I kept wanting more and more to the point where I should've stopped eating 20-30 minutes previous to when I actually did.  My favorites were the Garlic Filet Mignon, Parmesean crusted pork and the Linguisa.  The polenta was cooked to perfection and loved the caramelized bananas they delivered as side dishes.  Everyone got a dessert and loved it.  Since we were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday, they decorated the plate with her dessert with \"Happy Birthday\".  This is definitely on our list of special occasion dinner restaurants along with some others.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Celebrated my daughter's 21st birthday here.  It is our first visit here, and we didn't know what to expect other than it's going to be pricy.    i'm pretty selective on the type of meat I eat, and luckily, they serve fish and also the salad bar.  The salad bar isn't something to write home about.  I think it's pretty ordinary, may be a little bit better than at Sizzler, but at least Sizzler serves soup and chicken wings in their salad bar.    I ordered the sea food, and it was moy delicioso.    For the meat eater in our party, they seem to have enjoyed their meals.  So, overall, it was a nice experience for every body."}
{"text":"Underwhelming and over-priced.    Mrs. Wanderer became a fan of churrasco, Brazilian barbecue after eating at the outstanding Via Brasil in Vegas last year so we popped in Fogo de Chao to see how they compared.  Answer: not favorably.  The best thing about this place is the physical appearance of the restaurant but it's all downhill from there. Two star food, one star service and a four star price.    The salad bar was just okay but really nothing to get excited about. We were much more interested in the meat courses than messing around so after a perfunctory pass at the antipasti we had the waiter clear our plates and waited for the meat to begin.  And waited. And waited some more.  Waiter after waiter walked by us, huge spear of meat in hand, head down, studiously ignoring us.  We finally managed to flag one down by literally, yelling.  We didn't know what else to do since we'd been waiting at least ten minutes for somebody to serve us and we were hungry.  We finally got some meat and it was fine but then the same thing happened on the next course.  For the next hour we played this game where the waiters would walk by us doing their best to avoid eye contact and we'd try to intercept them.  It's very hard to avoid concluding that they are really not that keen on giving you meat here which kind of negates the point of being a churrascaria.   The three sides were all mediocre and unmemorable: soggy microwaved bananas, mashed potatos and fried polenta wedges.    For this kind of money, I'd much rather eat at Ruth's Chris or Morton's."}
{"text":"I ate here for a late birthday lunch with my sister (plus her bf) and the food and service was top notch. For lunch you get the same food for a cheaper price but even the dinner price is well worth it. It was a buffet style restaurant, where you pay one price and get all the food you can eat (except dessert+drinks). We started at the salad bar but there were so many good food that my plate was full with no space for the meat so I had to get a second plate. They give you this card where you flip over when you want to be served with the freshly cooked meat. They have their servers walking around with the meats looking for people to be served.  We tried every type of meat on the menu and I loved it all. They even had bacon wrapped meats which were amazing (who doesn't love bacon?). Did I already mention the service was excellent? Well, they have a friendly staff who are all very efficient. When we asked for a particular meat we were craving, they would bring it right away. When we asked a question about the restaurant, they gave us an informative answer. Lou who seemed to be the customer service manager, came to our table asked how everything was and had a good sense of humor. All-in-all I was blown away with the Brazilian Steakhouse experience. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Fogo Vs. The guys from Texas?  I say its a close tie.  They both serve very similar heavenly cuts of meat.  They both offer a diverse salad bar and drink menu.  The price for lunch and dinner is slightly different, give or take a couple bucks.  Both places have exceptional customer service.  1 point for Fogo because they serve better tasting and cheesier cheese  bread.  1 point for Texas for their Lobster Bisque.  If I were to choose between the two, I guess I would say whoever thinks of offering free back rubs by beautiful brazilian woman first!  ...On second thought, we were offered free flan for dessert by our waiter.. Good enough!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Fogo De Chao 5 stars. Their food is amazing. I have been 3 times, and 2 of the 3 times were perfect.   Fogo De Chao is certainly an experience, you start off with the salad bar, which is no where near your typical Jell-o salad bar. They have smoked salmon, and their fresh Parmesan cheese wheel is extremely unique for most places.  The meat selection is not only good, the taste is out of this world. The service for the most part is phenomenal you never have to ask for anything.  Now having said that, my husband and I went to Fogo for Valentine's day. We had reservations, and I understood that we would be waiting. It was more the fact that they had probably about 50, 2 person tables crammed into one of their big rooms to the point that you could not pull your chair out to get up from your table without being in someone elses lap, and forget about getting the meat selection you want if you were in the corner, which we were. Half of the gauchos completely ignored our corner.   It was less then to be desired.  Pros: Fantastic Food and atmosphere (non holiday)  Cons: Holiday planning on their part. Just don't go."}
{"text":"By far the best Brazilian Steakhouse ever!!!!  The meat is just perfectly cooked and very very well seasoned. It's melt in your mouth!   When you first walk in you immediately see a nice wine cellar. Their wine selection is beautiful. You can order by the glass or by the bottle.   They have a great salad bar to start your taste buds off! It has the starches, salads and seafood.  The main event, of course is the streak and choice of meat they bring to you! Everything is amazingly delicious!   The service is prefect! They are very attentive!  This place is a must go to!!!"}
{"text":"The meat quality is prime. The service is great and they have add ons. The salad bar is also great, so many choices for sides that go great with the meat."}
{"text":"Been here in Houston, DC, and now Scottsdale. Good. Every. Time.  First, the pao de queijo is so good. Warm, soft, fluffy, slightly cheesy but not to heavy, I could eat them all night if I didn't have a lot of meat to devour later.  The sides, the bananas, fried polenta, mashed potatoes. I only ate the fried polenta, which is crispy deliciousness and not too salty, but my friends had the bananas and potatoes and liked those a lot.  Meat. Well, there's a lot. If it's your first time, I suggest you try A LITTLE BIT of everything to find out what you like, then just get those items. Considering it's more than 50$ a person, It's pretty much what you have to do to make it worthwhile. Since I've already done that, my go-tos are the lamb chops, leg of lamb, bacon wrapped filet mignon (probably only get 1-2, bacon, while delicious, tends to get heavy), and filet mignon. My husband really likes bottom sirloin too, which I'll also get if I'm in the mood.  The salad bar is also super awesome!! Which I would suggest eating at the end of your meal to make the most of your stomach space for the meat. There's this heart of something (forgot what it was) that looks kinda like a bamboo shoot (same color, shape) but it's not hollow. It's got a light sour taste to it (like artichoke hearts) and the outside texture is kinda like artichoke hearts, but the middle is almost creamy. If you like that flavor and texture, def try it. I have no idea what it is but I like it! Other than that, fruit's pretty good, they had prepared orange and grapefruit slices which is a huge plus if you've ever eating a grapefruit.  They also have a salad bar only option if you have vegetarian friends/family. I think that's about 30$ or so? Still a bit selection.  Service is good too! The meat handlers may feel a bit pushy, but don't hesitate to say no if you don't want what they're offering. There are also floor managers making sure that if there's ever a lull in your meat service that they get you what you want.  If you haven't been and have money, goooooo!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the world.  14 Different meats! Each meat cooked to your preference all on the same \"sword?\".  The service is very efficient and quite speedy. Their salad bar is awesome and very fresh.  Each meat I've had there (and I've had them all) is always delectable and prepared to perfection.  I can not recommend this place enough!! I tell all of my clients to try this place and they have all loved it!  Thank you Fogo for all the great experiences and for always taking care of my clients!!  WE WILL ALWAYS BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"Went here recently with my wife. The only down side about this place is that the food is so good, that you get full way too fast! The salad bar is packed with a variety of ingredients, and if you wanted you could probably go there for a great meal just from the salad bar. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, and also very professional. It's not just about them bringing you a variety of meats, if you want a certain type, you can request it, and however you want it cooked. Pricing is very reasonable, and my only recommendation is not to eat all day before you go here, you will definitely get your money's worth and more with the amount of food that goes around!"}
{"text":"Before anything I'd like to state that: I have a love-hate relationship with these type of restaurants due to overindulging and having my belly hurt. But, it was convenient. I am fairly often in the vicinity of this place (it's by my favorite starbucks) I've always wanted to try it. I finally did it.    This place was really good. I liked the decor. Very clean yet robust-like. They have a pretty good selection of wines.   Now for the food. The meat was solidly good. The salad bar selection was very good. I liked the smoked salmon, the wild mushrooms, the cheeses, and the simple sliced tomatoes. The cheese bread that is automatically brought to the table was yummy. The fried banana was very yummy. The service excellent!!! They were all professional. Had this little pep in their step. They chatted with their guests.   The minuscule issues that I had were. The hostess didn't smile when greeted (I know it's petty but it does make one feel a little awkward approaching such). Another; I've been to churrascarias before and I was aware of the turning the wooden peg over to be approached by the meat-handlers. There was no peg but a coaster of which I was made aware of such after sitting a while and not knowing what to do."}
{"text":"I tell you what, the only reason I came to Fogo is that I got a gift card for Christmas. So I made a reservation on Open Table finally and Fogo was our choice tonight. Its a protein night.   After walking through two sets of double door, we were greeted by the hostesses. To the left is the bar and to the right is the dining area. It's only 5:30 but already packed. Good thing I made reservations. Very modern looking with lots of people running around.   Right as we're seated, one of the servers explained how everything works here. All your pre-meat is all you can eat at the buffet table which has salads, cheese, veggies, and other goodies. I have to say it's a unique buffet cause haven't really seen this type of stuff at other places.   For you meat which includes beef, pork, chicken, and lamb. They give everyone at the your table a card which is turned to RED. When you want meat turn the card to green and the guys with meat will come by your table and slice your preferred cut. They even give you your own pair of tongs to grab the sliced meat.   So I loved to pre-meat meal. Loved the smoked salmon, Caesar salad, different cheese, prosciutto, and grilled veggies. Just make sure you don't get to full on this cause you still have your meat.   The meat is great. You can pick what you want. They just ask you if you would like whatever they are serving and if you want rare, medium or well done. Saw beef tenderloin, lamb, chicken, pork chops, sausage. It's all good. I enjoyed all the meats. I even saw some bacon wrapped too. So they got everything.   The service was excellent. This is no joke. They had at least 3 different servers helping us and others filling our water glasses, exchanging our dirty plates and multiple people ask how everything was. Even had a Manager ask us if we needed anything special or meat and was willing to bring out for us. What stood out was my son and wife asked for tea and then wanted a hot water refill so with the new hot water they also go new cups and tea bags too. No questions asked but what was surprising was my son stomach wasn't feeling good at the beginning and the servers were helping him find a bubbly drink to help calm his stomach. He got a Pellegrino with mango something in it and it did help calm it down. Very nice. Shoutout to Karina and I think Bryan. They are all great  We were stuffed but we still have to try their dessert (FYI it's extra cost). So many options. We went for the Key Lime pie and the Papaya cream. Loved the Papaya cream. It was vanilla ice cream mixed with Papaya. Very smooth. The key Lime pie was different than others but was very good too.   We loved it at Fogo. It's pretty expensive but  comes with so much. All you can eat meat and sides. Oh yea forgot, they bring to you table this cheese bread. It's so go when hot. Also bring mashed potatoes and fried bananas.    So great atmosphere with friendly service that goes out of their way to serve you. Food is great. It's a meat paradise. We enjoyed and will be back again for another meat coma."}
{"text":"Have you every wanted to be fed like King Henry VIII?  A big goblet in one hand, exquisite, endless dishes of extravagant foods being feed to you almost intravenously until you have gorged yourself jolly and need a coma to recover?  Well, your highness, there is a haven for you in Scottsdale.  Fogo de Chao is paradise for the carnivore AND the vegetarian alike.  You will be seated at a table amidst a spacious floor plan and promptly greeted politely with a drink order.  Then comes the salad bar, which hosts a cornucopia of fresh lettuces, tomatoes, sundried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, macaroni salads, cheeses, olives, cucumbers, prosciutto, salami, smoked salmon, ceviche, and hot white fish in a delectable sauce, among other things.  There is a round, 2 sided card at your table.  Red means stop, green means go.  When you have finished plundering the salad bar booty, turn your card so green is faced up.  This begins the carnivore carousel as a parade of servers will sprint to your table with one carving station after another of meat.  Oh, sure, you can wave them off if you're not interested, but who are you kidding?  Try EVERYTHING!!!  My personal favorites are the lamb chops, the lamb tenderloin, the sausage, the filet wrapped bacon, and the #1 - the top round - I order everything medium (did I mention that they ask you how you'd like it prepared?  And then they bring bottom round, garlic beef, chicken wrapped in bacon, ribs, center cut sirloin, rib eye, and probably a couple more that I can't remember.  Everything is tender and juicy, fresh, well seasoned, and fit for a king.  You are also served polenta cake, fried bananas and mashed potatoes, also never ending.  You may also request sauces - I'm particular to the mint jelly and the creamy horse radish, though they offer others.  And don't forget dessert - the cheesecake tastes like it was shipped in from New York that day.  GO FOR LUNCH!!!  It's only $29 at lunch time, $19 for just the salad bar, kids 6 and under FREE, otherwise $14 for kids.  A small king's ransom, but worth every penny and then some.  Then go back to your castle and nighty night.  Please don't behead your wife."}
{"text":"Best service ever! I enjoyed all the cuts of meat but my favorite was a marinated pork chop. When I told the waiter I liked it, they cooked more and brought it right away to me.  I loved the soup of the day which was ginger carrot.  I loved the coffee.  It was not as loud as the Brazilian steak house at town square. To me seemed higher end and nicer to have a conversation.  I honestly thought it would be more expensive because of how nice it was and was surprised it was the same price as the other steak houses.  This will be my go to Brazilian steak house from now on."}
{"text":"Excellent place.  Very clean and the servers are very professional.  The quality of the salads are top notch and the meats are tasty.  The atmosphere is wonderful.  Excellent place to take a date or family."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for special occasions for the last 8 plus years...never disappoints. The admission price is steep per person, but unlimited meat and great service make it well worth the price of admission. Also the only place I know of that makes good lamb chops. Try the limeade too!"}
{"text":"Came here for a fam bam celebration. Not disappointed.... carnivore's dream come true. Reservation is a must, wait staff cordial and courteous, value for food was acceptable.... attire ranged from casual to elegant casual to a few in semi formal ...."}
{"text":"Fogo De Chao is a Brazilian Steakhouse, AKA an All-You-Can-Eat Delicious Meat dinner.  They also have the option of just doing the salad bar if you are not a meat eater.  The sides and salad bar have tons of fresh veggies, imported/gourmet cheeses, cured meats, and various Brazilian style side dishes.  Let's just say there are a ton of great options to start with so definitely start by grabbing a plate here.    They have these cards on the table with one side green (go-feed me more) and the other side red (stop-I'm full or need a break).  Flip your card over to green and the chefs start to serve you fresh cuts of meat that are brought to your table and sliced right onto your plate.  Choose from chicken (even bacon wrapped chicken!), beef (at least 3 different kinds), pork, sausage links, and they even have lamb.  When you are satisfied then flip your card back to red.    I'm always so full that I don't have room for desert but one of these days I'm gonna try the Molten Chocolate Cake!  The table next to us ordered it and I was literally drooling.  I'm getting hungry just writing this review. . . ."}
{"text":"This past Saturday (around 9pm) was our first time trying the restaurant. I was extremely impressed by the service we received that evening. The hostess was very welcoming and I was really happy that she was genuinely interested in our visit by citing the notes that our concierge provided, such as us staying at Red Rock and celebrating a special occasion. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff never made us feel rushed since we came in during the last hour. The best thing though was when a familiar looking server served us and she was extremely pleasant and anticipatory. She actually remembered us from when she and her husband worked at another Brazilian steakhouse and remembered how many kids we had and how we eat out only during special occasions, i.e. our anniversary. I'm actually embarrassed that I don't remember her name when she remembered so much about us! The encounters with the staff truly proves that excellent service is what they strive for and I would definitely recommend this place to our friends and family."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao has impeccable service. There are multiple waiters and waitresses that are POLITELY checking on you. Notice how I highlighted the word politely. I hate it when waiters at other restaurants check on you, but they don't seem to care whether you're mid-bite or mid-conversation. However at Fogo, our waiter quietly and patiently waited for us to end our conversation... we didn't even notice he was there!  I honestly cannot remember which meats were my favorite, but anytime they said \"House Special\" it was freakin bomb. After awhile, all the meat started to taste the same... I guess that's what happens when you eat like 10 different types of meat!  The salad bar wasn't that amazing, but I mean, you do come here for the meat. Not the salad ;)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is really nice on the inside. I had the opportunity to be one of the firsts guests at the place for the night on a weekend and it was nice to see how the tables and food was set up so nicely. They have private rooms that looked great for a rehearsal dinner or large group. Intimate areas. The place settings and decorations on point.   The salad bar was very fresh and delicious. Fresh cheese, salads, fruits, rice, beans, bread, veggies. It would have been nice to see some soups but didn't see any.   The meats were on point and pretty juicy. We flipped our go card from red to green and had meat out to us within a couple seconds. When that card is green, it is green. I had to remember to turn the card to red cause they kept bring so much meat. I hear about steakhouses being too salty and I almost felt the meat needed some more salt. Some of the meat was bland. It was still good but needed something. When you got the meat they also serve bread, mashed potatoes, sweet banana and some other item. The bread and mash was delicious.   I was somewhat annoyed on how good the service was. It was like every 5 seconds someone was asking me if I was done with the mash or done with the bananas or done with my drink. Yeah I would like to take that last drink or eat that last bite of potatoes. Nope, they would just clear away. They will gladly bring you a whole new dish of mashed potatoes but really I just wanted to finish the last bite. Really this was the only reason I gave 4 stars. OO. and its pretty pricey. At least for me. I really don't eat that much and we were only there for about 20 minutes before being completely stuffed. So was it really worth $150 bucks. Maybe, maybe not."}
{"text":"I've been to two Fogo de Chao locations now. It's a very nice chain of Brazilian steakhouses. My experience at this location was great. They accommodated our large party, food was great, wait staff was very attentive. Only gripe is the drinks are pretty pricey..."}
{"text":"Attended a special event at Fogo. The staff was prompt and listened to any requests. The \"produce bar\" had quite a few very nice items on it. Like the Prosciutto, the apple salad, artichoke hearts, etc. The Peppered bacon was tasty. Some of the meats that came to the table were still moo'ing. I like the meat a little more cooked, but that's my choice. It was a good experience, but I'm glad I didn't have to pick up the bill for the 12 people. Ouch!"}
{"text":"Its hard for me to say much more then all the other review that this place has. This was the 3rd time coming here from the far west side of phoenix (over 40 miles away) and it is a meat lovers paradise. Servers are very attentive with all the various meats they serve.     our visits this time was to take out of town family member, who loves meat and has never been to a brazilin style steakhouse.   I would probably visit Fogo more often but it is just so far from our house."}
{"text":"Do you like meat? Do you love a great atmosphere? Are you human? If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, you need to go to Fogo de Chao immediately. Seriously, like right now. Stop reading this review and go.  Ok, welcome back. I'm sure you're as stuffed and immovable as I am right now. I weep that I am not Shakespeare, for I cannot put together the necessary words to adequately describe how amazing the food was and how awesome our customer server Lou, was.   Firstly, the food is phenomenal. I was expecting merely adequate meat with the whole gimmick being that the food is never ending and that they cut it at your table. I could not have been more wrong. The meat, the seasoning, the lingering, smokey flavor was simply the best I ever had. It took all of my willpower not to ask the server to take the slice of meat for himself and to leave the skewer. Tonight, while I am in the midst of a meat coma, I will be dreaming of their top sirloin and filet. (Sorry Kaley Cuoco, Fogo gets top billing tonight).  One aspect that guarantees that I will be coming back, too often for my bank account to recuperate, I'm sure, is the customer service. Derek, our waiter, did a great job of explaining the protocols to my wife and I as this was our first time there. But it was the Customer Server Lou, that really stood out and made the night memorable. I have experienced a lot of restaurant employees who checked on you simply because it was their job to do so, but Lou really cared, this was evident from his first introduction. He treated us like close family and ensured that we were cared for and well fed. I was celebrating a promotion, but Lou definitely stole the show. I can't say enough nice things about how great he was and how relaxed he made us feel."}
{"text":"My family and I came to this restaurant to celebrate my cousin's wedding. I heard from all around how great this place is, so you know I was excited and eager to eat. Apon entering the restaurant the decor was beautiful, you can tell this is a very upscale place. As we were seated they had a table waiting for us and provided cheese bread which was delicious. The waiter came up to us and explained how this all works. On your table, there is a circular card which I thought was a coaster on one side was green the other red. Green indicates you are ready to be served meat and red means not at this time. You have a choice of many different types of meats, a salad bar and sides of rice, beans etc.  As we made our way to the salad bar I was very unimpressed with the very minimal choices they had for an all you can eat salad bar. Being an upscale restaurant I expected so much more. Some of the items on the salad bar were not even labeled so I had no idea what they were. As we made our way back to the table and flipped our card around the meat started coming our way. They have many different choices pork, chicken, beef, etc. As I was trying the different meats only a few stood out. The bacon wrapped chicken and parmesan pork were my favorites. I tried several other types of meat some were too salty and others were really bland. I even asked the waiter for a specific type of meat I wanted and it never came around. At times this place can be a bit overwhelming with everything going on.  In my honest opinion, I really did not think it was worth $52.00 per person. I would have rather gone to Orange sky or Donovans and had a steak."}
{"text":"Despite the high price of admission, Fogo is our favorite restaurant and we look for occasions or excuses to splurge. We first experienced Fogo in Philadelphia, but this location is even better, mostly from a service perspective (since their menus are the same). At this location, it is not hard to sample all the meat, even the more expensive tenderloin and ribeye.   You start your meal at the salad bar (which could be a meal in itself if you have vegetarian friends), which has great selections including fresh mozzarella, smoked salmon, prosciutto, and the best apple salad I've had anywhere. And then, onto the main course, an all-you-can-eat meat extravaganza. You control the pace of your meal by indicating when the servers should come by and carve your selection table-side off of large skewers. It's like getting dinner and a show as the gauchos dart through the dining room with sizzling hot selections. Our favorite is the house special, Picanha, and of course the bacon-wrapped filet mignon. While chowing down you are also given unlimited side dishes, including airy, irresistible cheese bread, crispy fried polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, and carmelized bananas. And, if you save room for dessert, their creme brulee is second to none. I wouldn't recommend their cakes though."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at this restaurant(the Flamingo location ) and was expecting  a wonderful dining experience paired with deliciously flavorful  food. Unfortunately,  the anticipation did NOT meet the expectation. I'd made reservations for 3,  a week in advance for  7:00 p.m. on a Saturday  night. When we arrived , we were promptly seated to a poor attempt to replicate a  white linen table setting. The wine glasses were dull and water spotted from what I can only guess , were ran through a hard water dishwashe.The linen had food/liquid stains (I hope) and  ink pen markings (I guess from either the previous guest signing their check or a toddler drawing pictures). Black linen napkins ? Humph? After observing the white table covering..leaves you to wonder the cleanliness of the napkins to wipe up after the meal. The wait staff.After being asked 3 times by 3 different  staff members, (each speaking just one decibel shy of screaming macaw), if we'd been to the restaurant before , rattled off scripted instructions for the dining service. The first staff member , a young female, with a high pitched voice , made no eye contact, had a bed head hairstyle  pulled back and had on a wrinkled shirt. We saw her as we sat through her pitch but  never again after that. In comes  Joshua our waiter (I'd hoped ). We listened again to the hurried script then  was awarded with a long wait before we ever received the water we 'd ordered . Then he disappeared. Only to reappear after awhile. .. Him -\"Oh , yeah?! ...I will bring the garlic mashed potatoes and  the fried plantains \"  US- \" Oh, boy ! Can't wait!). I ordered a glass of wine. ..which Josh, appeared to almost forget ask if I would like to sample or \"taste\" before beginning to pour,  then catching himself to wait for my response after pouring. We saw him in passing once or twice times more, as he walked by our table during dinner, casually asking is everything OK. He really didn't give a damn. The food. The salad bar had a nice presentation but appeared picked over and unreplenished. The  red meats were NOT seasoned, leaving you to look for a sauce or \"something \" to make it palatable and   Dessert. I ordered Creme Brule . That was cold. A third staff member stopped by  our table to drop off/pu our bill...after my husband unsuccessfully attempted to raise  Joshua's attention  for the bill which for 2 people was  $145.00 , that included three alcoholic beverages,  plus  a generous $40.00 cash tip. Dining experience rated 2 stars. I hit the third star by mistake. Just want to add, I am a Vegas native and know when food is good and hospitality is exquisite.  I dine out frequently and have ate  at some of the best restaurants this town has to offer. This particular restaurant...at this location and the service just did not live up to its expectations."}
{"text":"The s/o and I have been to several Brazillian steakhouses, including Texas de Brazil, Pampas and a few located in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I've heard of Fogo de Chao for several years, but there was never a convenient location until I realized there's now a location in Vegas so, we had to check it out.  Very typical setup as the other steakhouses we've been to, as it features a buffet of various salads, cheese, cured meats, and a few hot items such as rice, potatoes and vegetables.  They also serve you a plate of plantains, fried polenta and mashed potatoes...the instant kind, not real mashed potatoes, for the price you'd pay you'd think they wouldn't skimp on quality.  The saving grace was their cheese bread, it was seriously the BEST cheese bread from a Brazillian steakhouse we've had!  What nice is that they'll refill it with a piping hot batch on request.  They had a variety of about a dozen or so meats, varying from the traditional Picanha (Top Sirloin), Filet Mignon, Rib Eye, Pork Ribs, Sausage, Chicken wrapped in Bacon, and other cuts of Sirloins.  They also had a Rib of Beef, which is served cut from a cutting board but you have to specifically request it as it's not an item that they walk from table to table.   First off, avoid the sausage and even the chicken, you can eat that anytime, anywhere.  If all you eat is the Rib of Beef, do it, it's the only super darn delcious cut of meat they offer!  With that said, yeah, the cuts of the various beef were lacking in flavor, I almost wanted to ask for steak sauce.  Unlike other Brazillian steakhouses we've been to, FdC did not serve Grilled Pineapple...if you haven't had it, you're seriously missing out, it just makes you enjoy the various meats even more.  My biggest gripe about FdC was the ambiance.  It was a nice, typical white linen type of steakhouse.  However, although I do understand the \"meat guys\" as I call them are running around from table to table, there were just way too many wait staff walking around.  It made the dining experience slightly unnerving that you'd get bumped into (which I did), get something spilled on you (almost happened, but observed it happening on the dining room floor, twice) and just sheer pandamonium.  It seriously was like a sea of people dressed in white shirts running around like chickens without heads.  We've never experienced that at any Brazillian steakhouse we've been to.  There was even a guy pushing a cart of liquor from table to table, which added to the chaos.  When we got our check, we skipped using the plastic, left cash instead and seriously beelined out of there.  Sorry, can't say we'll be back."}
{"text":"I've never had a disappointing experience in a Fogo de Chao.  This was no exception.  Came early and had a happy hour drink at the bar before an early dinner reservation.  Both the bartender and our waiter were friendly and helpful.  The recommended (and specially priced) drink was really good.  The dinner meats were outstanding, as expected.  Used emailed coupons with absolutely no fuss and no attitude.  Lots of free self-parking outside.  Great visit and looking forward to the next one."}
{"text":"Been to different Brazilian bbq places and the only difference is this place is over priced.   We didn't have reservations so we sat at the bar, after sitting there for 10 minutes we just went to the waiting area as no one came to our table for drinks. Customer service when we got to our table was ok.   We went to the market bar,  I got rice and it was hard like it just been sitting there,  I enjoyed the kale and chicken salad.  They give you plantain, mash potatoes and Bread. For the meat, of all the selections I only enjoyed the special sirloin, and my bf enjoyed the lamb chops. Everything else was pretty average at best."}
{"text":"I'm not an all you can eat steak kind of person, but for Valentine's Day I decided to try it out for my husband. Walking in the decor is beautiful. The servers are all dressed as if they're about to hang out with some bulls in Brazil. I love character dressing, so it impressed me. They sat us down immediately. One of the servers in our area explained how it all works. He said that we could start at the salad bar first or turn over the card to the color green to start the all you can eat meat \"buffet\". We decided to try out the salad bar. The salad bar itself is incredible. It has this amazing caesar salad, olives, roasted red peppers, charcutterie, cheeses, and the most amazing potato salad I have ever had in my life. Honestly, I would just eat there, but at last - I had to try the meat.   We flipped our cards to green and immediately someone came by serving us pieces of meat. It was delicious. We had parmesan Pork Chops, Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin, Lamb Chops, and some type of sausages. Besides, the parmesan Pork Chops, it was all really delicious. After the amazement died down, we both realized they kept coming around with the same type of meat/poultry. You're allowed to ask for what you want, but even then it took a WHILE for that to come by. You would think that most of these meats would have a medium rare option, but most of the time it was well done. And who eats steak well done? It's just too chewy at that point. Other times, it would be on more of the rare side. I understand that you can't always cook meat perfectly, but still. There really should never be a well done option.   Of all the Brazilian steakhouses I've been to, this by far the better one. Next time, I would come when they weren't as busy and spend more time at the salad bar!"}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch. I have heard great things about fogo, for a Long time. The salad bar/buffet was really nice. Didn't eat much from there. But what I had was good. The coaster thing was different, kinda cool. Several of there meats where good...but not great. (I grill at home...ALOT) so I was a little disappointed. My favorite was the rib eye was my #1, then #2 was bacon wrapped filet, #3 was the chicken wings. I tried the lamb, beef rib, top sirloin, sausage. I am a meat lover, so... The ambiance was nice, I would go again. Oh yeah the Crum Brielle was really good."}
{"text":"We ate here along with a large group. It was my first time at Fogo, though I have heard many great things about it. I LOVED the salad bar. I could have happily eaten from there alone--the fresh mozzarella was divine. However, the meat is the highlight of this place, and quite an impressive one. Wayfaring servers with meat on swords--what's not to like? My favorites included the filet mignon with bacon, parmesan pork, and lamb.   Of the sides on the table, I really liked the Pão de Queijo cheese rolls--like big, soft bubbles! The mashed potatoes just tasted like mashed potatoes and the bananas just weren't my sort of thing.  While the meat service was constant, the regular table service was lacking. My section in the middle of the table was almost entirely ignored. I only acquired a drink because my husband directed a server my way; I only had one water refill the whole time, and my finished plate awaited pick up for about 30 minutes. People seated around me gave up and walked to the bar to get drinks.   The dessert offerings that night were chocolate mousse cake, cheesecake, and tres leches. My husband chose the mousse cake, and I thought he made the right call; I had the tres leches, which tasted bland to me. All of the dessert slices were pretty small, which is probably wise considering the meat smorgasbord.   My husband adored the place. The service issues were frustrating for me, but overall I liked it. If you're a carnivore, it's the place to go."}
{"text":"Came her for lunch on a Monday and the buffet was only $15 because I did not participate in the meat feast.  The salad bar is a little bit smaller than the one in Beverly Hills but all the essentials are there.  Staff is attentive and will come around with many refills and cuts of meat per request of the table."}
{"text":"Sim Por Favor!  Fantastic evening, from start to finish!  From the clean surroundings, to the sincere and courtesy staff it was truly an enjoyable meal. . It was the first time for our entire group of six and we were treated like royalty. Special kudos to manager Ricardo and who only took time to stop by and introduce himself, but also answered the many questions we had about the restaurant,  the chefs and the entire Brazilian Steakhouse concept. The salad bar would have been enough in most cases but we had all come for the meat. Disappointed we were not. The meat selection and presentation were both superb and well worth the price of the meal.  Many thanks for a job and meal exceptionally done well."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome customer service from Vicente!! Thanks  for the fabulous meal."}
{"text":"For about $50/person, the food is legit. No doubt about that.  One warning though... MEAT. A... lot... of... meat. I found myself not wanting to eat meat for another month after eating there.  Personally, that type of cuisine isn't my favorite. It's very in-your-face with meatiness and saltiness, without much to give you contrast. I prefer a balance of flavors. But, Fogo is still an awesome splurge for a special night out."}
{"text":"I came here for my 3 year anniversary with my boyfriend and it was a hands down wonderful experience.  The wait staff are extremely kind and attentive. One waiter ,Vince, stood out above the rest. He went above and beyond to make sure all our needs were met. The food was so delicious! The staff bring all kinds of meat to your table and everything was amazing. We plan to come here again. Definitely a place to go for special occasions."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently celebrated our 14th Wedding Anniversary at this restuarant with several of our friends back in September. The food was fabulous! The ambience perfect! Nice bar area too! We went during restaurant week so it was super busy! Our waitress began to slack a bit and we had issues at the end of our meal, but the Manager on duty quickly resolved things for us! This Manager went above and beyond to make us happy and ensure that we would be repeat customers! We will! Thank you Fogo de Chao! We will be dinning there in 2 weeks! Our friends from CA will be joing us! We are looking forward to another wonderful dinner!  Thank you Pamela,"}
{"text":"We had a great time. I love proper service and I can't say enough about how pleased I am. Every server was happy, polite and very friendly. The salad bar was great. There was a bowl of very dry bacon, how can you not be happy with this. All the salads I tried were top notch. Sliced cheese and meats were great. Don't go crazy there, the meats being served table side are delicious. The sirloins and ribeye were my favorites. Grilled bananas were one of the sides and I loved those. Desert was a chocolate mouse cake, devine. I will be there again!"}
{"text":"I cannot begin to explain how amazing the food is here. I've been to places like this before, but always felt the supplemental bar lacks, but not here. Prime meats and cheese, olives, different salads, and the best zucchini I've had...and butternut squash soup is heavenly. The meats that comes around is a little too well done for my liking, but the did go back and get me some medium lamb chops on my request. I do think the apps and the drinks are overpriced, as they don't add much to the experience. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week, and they sure did deliver!  The salad bar was RIDICULOUS- seriously, artichoke hearts, shittake mushrooms, roasted garlic! Holy cow, it was insanely good! Could do without the buffet style, but its restaurant week, so I'll give them a break.  The main course was delicious. When that card is flipped to the green side, beware! They come at you quickly, offering you bacon wrapped chicken, filet mignon, garlic steak.. So much to choose from! The sausage was wonderful, as was the filet. Order on the rare side, because the steak tends to be over cooked.   The desert was wonderful, but I was so full that it was quite difficult to finish it! I had the Tres Leches cake, and it definitely blew away my expectations.  Just to note, they have a wonderful wine list, as well as very nice valet in front! Do visit!"}
{"text":"The food is decent and the portions are HUGE, basically it's all you can eat so you better come hungry to make the most of it. I think this place is more about the experience of servers coming around with skewers of different types of meat than the actual food. It's pricey and nothing special. However, if you are a big meat eater I'm sure you will love this place."}
{"text":"The service here was amazing. I used to go to the Fogo de Chao back home in Atlanta. And this place is just as good. The cuts of meat are awesome and their fresh salad and fruit bar is good as well. They also comped our creme brule since it was my boyfriend's birthday. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"What a great meal. What a great time. Everything was beyond excellent. Our waiter, Christian made our experience over the top perfect.  The only disappointment was when i was full and had to stop eating."}
{"text":"I came here for Restaurant Week with my two girlfriends and we were served some of the most mouthwatering cuts of assorted roasted meats by some of the hottest Latin waiters I've ever laid eyes on...Holy smokes!!  0_0  You know what they say, come for the meat and stay for the meat."}
{"text":"The best food you can get in Scottsdale! It's amazing awesome food! It's worth the money, I understand it's a bit pricey but it is worth every penny. The best meat I've ever had in my life"}
{"text":"I went here for Brunch and the dishes were dirty and there wasn't enough tongs for all the items at the salad bar so things were getting cross contaminated   I have to say I was very disappointed with that  The meat was salty but the dessert station had a banana flavored dip that was delicious with the fruit"}
{"text":"We come here every nye and have a blast! It's a bit pricy but if you plan on eating until you can't move - this is the place to go! They serve great meat and provide an excellent salad/hot bar! The fried bananas are AMAZING!!! Plus the service is always on top of their game!"}
{"text":"Free salad bar !  I came here to celebrate anniversary hehe :)  We've tried all the meat on the menu, and I gotta say, NON of them had disappointed me! Excellent service, they come by and check up on you every 15 minutes! At the end of our meal, they even came up to us with a complimentary flan with candles and decoration to wish us happy anniversary! very sweet!  They also have variety of wine choice( I didnt get to try it because wine makes me sleepy haha).   If you're in vegas, and dont wanna wait in line for buffet, this could be your back-up plans :)"}
{"text":"Eat here! If you are in Vegas and want an amazing meal, with wine and dessert for $200 or less, this is the place for you!!!! Now some might think $200 is outrageous, and it is pricy, but this included a $40 tip and a $50 bottle of wine (you really don't have inexpensive options for wine at this place) and it is worth every penny, and more! Our first option was going to be somewhere on the strip, whose owner is a Top Chef judge, but then we would have had at least doubled the price once you added in drinks and desert, so we trusted the yelpers of the world, and they did not disappoint. We made our reservations a couple weeks before we went online and requested a corner table, which we got. It was nice for privacy and people watching. Once we sat down we were greeted by our server immediately who was very knowledgable. Over the course of the meal we were also greeted and checked on by at least three other manager/servers (Derek, you are awesome!). This could easily constitute some of the best service I've received at a restaurant ever.   So the food......we'll start with the salad bar, whose name makes you cringe a little and think, \"why would I go to a nice dinner at a restaurant that has a salad bar?\" however, its name does not do it justice, it should be called an antipasto bar, or just \"bar of tasty treats\". it has several good cheeses, salamis, fresh asparagus, smoked salmon and cream cheese, breads, typical salad items (which I skipped entirely), marinated onions, sundried tomatoes, etc......everything was great! Then you get back to your table and turn your card over which starts the gauchos (the men with meat). This also tells your server to bring out the sides (yes more tasty treats!) Your sides consist of creamy mashed potatos, crispy polenta squares, and roasted plantains. All three of these were exactly what you aspire to make when cooking at home, just great.  Finally, you have your meat. There are 15 or 16 different types of meat that come around and you can ask for as much or as little as you want (I recommend starting with a small bit of everything and then getting more if you still have room (doubtful). I think around half are different cuts and seasoning of steak, all equally tasty. I preferred the house style sirloin and the filet. You will also see chicken, sausage, lamb, pork and ribs. Skip the chicken, the sausage was worth trying, but I wouldn't eat the whole thing, the ribs can definatley be skipped they were a bit dry. And then there is the lamb and pork, try a lot of both of these! The lamb was great and perfectly cooked, although the gauchos will ask you how you like any of these meats (minus chicken) cooked, and then they serve you from different spots of their meat based on your doneness preference. The lamb was tender and juicy, they offered mint jelly, but why do that? The pork was amazing, it is perfectly cooked to a juicy goodness and then coated in grated parmesean. I've never had this type of preparation before (usually you think crusted parm) but this was as good as it gets. One thing that really impressed my husband and I was how well seasoned all the meats were, I don't think you should ever have to add salt and pepper if it is cooked correctly, and you don't need to here. Finally, we ordered dessert (which I still wonder how we had room for) and went with the cheesecake with raspberry sauce. A perfect end to our meal. (they put a special note on the plate which I thought was a nice touch and showed our servers really seemed to care if we enjoyed our meal. see the pic I posted for the message) Overall, this was one of the best meals I've ever eaten from service to atmosphere and especially the food.  Eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Massive portions of delicious meat sawed off of skewers served by oily bo-hunks that most women will fawn over.  Oh and a salad bar.  Skip that though.  That's just filler that will rob your body of precious skewer meat.  Be careful here though...  you can get hit with a vicious bout of the \"Meat Sweats\" should you over indulge.  Go at lunch.  Cheaper, less crowded, and same food.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went here for fathers day, and they gave us a free dinner for going on fathers day to use at another time.  So I love the salad bar!  I can eat there the whole time.  There was some yummy stuff there.  My husband asked me if I had planned on eating any meat, lol  I guess I could be a vegan!   So from time to time I would get a small sample of meat.  Didn't really care for any of it.  Some Filet h came by, my husband got some, he raved about how good it was, so I grabbed a piece of his, it was amazing!  Service was great up until this point. So I ordered ordered a Filet Mignon for myselfe, even though I was soooooo full already.  So we waited, and waited and waited I know it had to be minimum 30 min we waited.  By then the fullness has set in, and I was just ready to go.   They said give it a few more min.  So we did, when it finally came, I got a couple of slivers, it was really good, and tender.  But the outer part had like some rock salt on it, and it was way too salty.  I can't wait to go back, and the only meat I want is the filet Mignon."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Great service with Amanda!!! Servers were always attentive. Made us feel welcome and the manager Ricardo was awesome!!! Highly recommended!!!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious however the service stands out the most with this place. It was incredible!!!! We were greeted by so many awesome employees including the management staff creating an unforgettable experience. The price is more than worth it and to top it off...cheaper than Texas de Brazil (plus the service was not all that at all there). I will for sure be visiting again."}
{"text":"Honeymoon's over folks.  The last visit did it for me.  We'd gone here regularly for special occasions and the last visit was our last.  Service was slow, the waiter was inattentive - we had better service from another waitress who recognized us from past visits.    The seating arrangement has been shuffled around and the lighting wasn't as bright as in the past.  It's turned into another ho-hum steakhouse."}
{"text":"Worth the per plate price! Outstanding quality meats and salad bar, great service."}
{"text":"So I'm not one to spend $30 on lunch... and probably won't be again for a while. I can't knock the place for my own likes and dislikes so I'll just say that the service was spot on, the food was quite impressive and the place is clean and well kept. I can see why so many people enjoy it... however it's not to may taste. The salad bar had a nice variety of options from chicken and pasta salads to a selection of cheeses and delicious prosciutto and salami. The bread and little appetizers they bring to the table were pretty good and the meat was hit or miss for me. Honestly, the dessert flan they brought out for a birthday was freaking awesome and probably my favorite part of the meal. Nice spot and maybe I'll be back in the future and I'll try to be hungrier next time!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. I like the quieter atmosphere compared to  Texas De Brazil. However, the salad bar did not have nearly as many choices. At first I thought, this could be a good thing as I'll have more room for the meats which, after all, is the point. Sigh. The meats were chewy. I was not impressed. Seasoning was great but who cares if the texture is not pleasant? As a Texas De Brazil fan, I'd been here once and never returned. Now I remember why. Glad it was at a discounted rate for veterans or I'd be even more irritated. All three of us unanimously agreed it did not rate compared to Texas De Brazil. I really wanted to like it too. Again, it's nowhere near as noisy and more relaxing. Oh well."}
{"text":"Before I start ripping this place for it's food, I have to give props where it's deserved!  This was some of the BEST service I've gotten in a restaurant. And that was the ONLY reason I considered giving Fogo a second star, but alas, well, the service and the pudim (or flan in english).  It was the BEST pudim that I've ever eaten outside of my Mom's home!!! And her pudim is to die for!  But the food, ahh the food, and the food was the reason for coming here right? Well the food,  let me see where do I start...  I have to highlight the fact that I really don't understand any of the previous reviewers that have written an opinion on this place, perhaps they just don't know any better, or the premise of the place \"clouds\" their taste buds.  Because this is without a doubt in my mind, the second worst Churrascaria Rodizio that I have EVER been to (the worst being a whole in the wall that used to exist in Honolulu, but has since closed (back in 08 or so..). It is important to salient the fact that I have been to several different Churrascarias in my life, throughout Brazil and the U.S. as well.  At the top of my list of good ones right now is Libra in Culver City, CA.    But I digress, I even tried to bring these facts to the manager, who at first tried to insinuate that I didn't know what I was talking about and became rather defensive, I understand, but customers concerns should be heeded, not argued about!  The manager being Brazilian, which I am also by heritage, however I do not carry an accent and while speaking English he simply saw me as a gringo, who doesn't know any better... But alas I explained the facts of life to him, after which he stated that the \"seasoning\" had to be what's-the-word-I'm-looking-for: toned down in order to appeal to the palates of all the tourists and etc...  This confession only came out after I named more than a few places that I had been to, the fact that despite being born in the US I had spent 14 years in country and knew the food well.  The conversation also took a turn to history of Brazil, not sure why he went there, but anyways, I followed, and in the end I got the \"truth\" out of him.  Which in his defense I found out that bland food is the norm in Vegas, blagh, I never tasted food so without \"life\", taste and soul than during my stay here...  We even went to the M Resort's Studio B buffet, again another disappointing meal: best meals? Secret Pizza and Sweet Tomatoes (yes, indeed!!!)  Nevertheless, I felt robbed in spending the amount of money that my wife and I did for a completely lackluster meal, that doesn't deserve any of the praises that have been sung previously!  The molho a campanha was the worst I've ever had, I actually enjoyed the chimichurri sauce, which was a little sacrilegious; the rice was dry as well as the black beans, the meat in general was lacking in the taste area, properly cooked, but not much flavor (they went too light on the sal grosso!), the buffet was bland in general and they did not have fries or onion rings (both traditionally present in similar buffets), only the polenta.  Overall I kept wishing I was back in LA at Libra!!!  Thank you for reading, and I hope I can help by saving others from this place!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, almost need s manual before ordering. Impressive array of food groups. Maybe. by design, no seafood. I apologize if I missed it. Everything I tasted was top notch. Best mashed potato i have had in some time. Polenta was great (I usually hate polenta). I could have stayed all afternoon."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before, both on New Year's eve and weekend evenings. This visit was mediocre at best. I can give some latitude for the lack of attentive service due to the holiday rush but couple that with a very small selection of vegetables and meat it made the high price tag and the slow and sometimes non existent service not worth a return trip. The bread, potatoes and plantains that were brought to the table were cold. Customers were making return trips to the self serve station with their used plates, it was totally unhealthy and there was no one there to stop them or teach them. There seemed to be plenty of staff just not enough of them were working smartly. I gave two stars and not one because my previous visits were acceptable or I would not have  returned."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here with a couple friends this past week and enjoyed it. We've been to other Brazilian steakhouses before and are a bit biased which is why it's not five. We were hoping there was similar variety in seasoning. This pace has many types of meat, but the seasoning could have been better. The best part is they are all cooked perfectly and provide all cooking levels. The salad bar is also great. My wife loves the bread they give in the beginning. It was delicious and has some cheese/buttery filling. The staff is very friendly as well. Great place overall."}
{"text":"If you're on a paleo diet this is The perfect spot for you.  Plenty of cuts of meats and salad bar with cooked veggies steamed and grilled.  If you never been to an Brazilian steak house you my friend don't know how to be a foodie fanatic.  The cuts of meat are premium and cooked to your liking.  if it's not, they will take it , cook it more or less which ever you prefer.  The customer service is super attentive. We need more spot like this in Las Vegas. We they did a lunch special tho lol."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! Great mojitos and be ready to eat! Great lighting. Lots of room."}
{"text":"Update review. Came here for Restaurant Week, the only time you really get any discount here.   Gone is the whole wheel of parmigiano. New addition of feijoada with farofa. It was fine, not spectacular.   Complimentary dessert during Restaurant Week. Got a tres leches cake which was pretty good. Overall meal, good value, meat was good as usual. Still the best churrascaria out there.   Like I wrote before, always get the picanha. And keep it on green."}
{"text":"I got invited to a birthday dinner at Fogo de Chao, there were about 40 of us and they set us up in an area that was a little off the main dining room and it provided privacy for our family.  The best thing about the meal were the sirloin offerings and cheese bread. I wish I skipped the salad bar but I understand its purpose. I was a little annoyed at the servers who offered the meat, they tried to push the pork with cheese on my family even if some of us said no, they put it on your plate. I said I don't eat pork but he put the meat on my side plate anyway. Please have some respect for my preferences.   I also did not like how, despite soda being included in our meal package, they did not serve us any sodas instead attempted to get us to order off-package drinks and dishes. I had to ask for my coke and they did not give us a refill even if it was included.   Lastly we hung around talking and eating until 10:00. They closed at 9 but left us alone, we only realized they were closed when we walked out to a dark dining room. We had to find them just to settle the bill. But I guess it was nice that they let us hang out and catch up."}
{"text":"Our annual trek to FDC for my birthday. Make it a point to go there somewhere each late-May. Love the food, selection, and generally the service. Sometimes there were lulls in waiting for specific cuts, but Lou, the customer experience leader, was helpful and very friendly. He helped track down the servers with what we were looking for. Not extremely kid-friendly, but not too bad. Young ones are free and have a decent selection at the Salad bar to choose from."}
{"text":"Omgoodness! The food was so delicious!! Let me suggest you start with the Lamb. I wish we had started with the lamb b/c I would have had a lot more of it.  All the meats were cooked to perfection and they have a very good wine list as well. I don't remember the wine my husband chose but it was equally fantastic. Service was also above and beyond. Each of our servers answered our questions and immediately brought what we wanted. Honestly, there is no reason to even visit the buffet for any of the sides, you're just going to want to have all the meats.  I will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"We made a quick stop here last night for dinner since we had been shopping.   I'm not usually the biggest fan of these types of places. For one, I feel they're overpriced. And secondly, I haven't had amazing meat that made me feel like my dinner was justified. Also, a lot of these types of restuarants overseason their meat. I've been to quite a few that the meat is so salty, you drink a gallon of water while you're there.   The main reason I'm writing a review is because of their service. This place, by far, had provided the best customer service to us. They were so friendly, thorough, and just generally very polite. Each time I got up, someone (even the manager) would rush to pull the seat out for me.  They made sure we enjoyed the food we were having, and they even offered us tastes of a couple of wines that we were inquiring upon. Even some upscale restaurants don't go out of their way for this.  The reason I'm bringing this up - we have spent $300-600 on a dinner, and the service wasn't even CLOSE to how this place treated us.   Overall - their meats are really good. They're cooked perfectly and not dried out (another thing I've experienced at steakhouses.) I personally love red meats to be cooked medium rare, and all of their red meat was cooked that way. That's always a good sign. Otherwise, please don't eat red meat.   If you're looking for a nice dinner with outstanding service, do come here. It was quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"So we took an overnight to Phoenix we decided to try this place out Tuscanos is way better!  The salad bar was not that great service was super slow.  We asked 4 times for a milk for our little one.  And of course it was way overpriced and most of the meat was chewy or lacked little flavor.  Never again even if it were free"}
{"text":"This is a Vegas staple for my friends and I! We always go to Fogo for lunch before we leave Vegas. Their lunch and prices can't be beat. The service is impeccable and the quality is superb! I only eat from the salad bar and that alone is worth the cost! My bf and friends always gorge themselves on the 16 types of meat ohing and ahing the whole time. I love the fried polenta and cheese balls that comes with the meal too!  If you can't afford the dinner price definitely go for lunch it's all the same thing for almost 1/2 the dinner price!"}
{"text":"This place is not up to par with the other fogos around the country at all. As a matter of fact, it's quite the opposite of luxury and 5 stars. My husband and I are fogo fans and go in every city we visit. We love it that much. We are beyond disappointed with this location. The food was old. The meats were so dry and flavorless. There was several waiters and waitresses flirting around with little regard to customer needs. The bread was so cold. The bananas were microwaved and cold. We brought up our concerns to the manager, Tracy and he got extremely defensive and unprofessional. Under his management, I can see why the staff is so nonchalant and disrespectful. For a $260 lunch date, we would have probably gotten better service and food at a Wendy's. We will not be returning and I will be escalating my concerns to corporate. I'm not sure if it was because it was a Sunday but fogo is always prime in our eyes due to the consistency between locations and cities. This one did not meet expectations."}
{"text":"Service unbelievable meat yummy .,polenta,so-so, good friends, drinks amazing. Also just makes that special occasion more special"}
{"text":"The best meat I've ever ate! This place is full of delicious meats! The food itself is worthy of 5 stars! I give it 4 because the staff is 2 stars. We waited with no food on our plates for over 20 minutes. The waiters are walking around looking like they don't know where to go or who to serve. I was so disappointed because I was ready to eat and had little to eat during the day so we could tear it up. Yes, I will go there again and again because it really is mouth watering delicious, but hopefully, the staff gets their stuff together."}
{"text":"A little pricey but well worth it. Should be considered one of the best restaurants period. Service was excellent from beginning to end. Taste was top notch. I had dinner alone but this would be great for a date or special occasion. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ...hate vegas. I find it dirty there...and weary to touch anything.  There is an imperative conference that takes place here to which is a must must for my company. My whole trip there is pleasant due to the people I'm with and this place was definitely my cup of tea. I am not a huge Meat consumer, however, i ate more meat here than i have in my entire life. It  is cooked to perfection, and .....mouth watering .....good. They also have fish and a salad area with more yummy goodness...its definitely a mans world in here but I am looking forward to going back next year and getting my chow on."}
{"text":"Where do I start Friday night, date night...Well I have to say that the atmosphere was nice...The meats not so much! We got several pieces that were way under cooked or dry as the desert! The guy splashed grease in my face twice while slicing, and dropped meat juice on and in my purse. We noticed that when they brought out better cuts such as ribeye, they skipped our table. We asked about the shrimp cocktail and the guy acted like we couldn't afford it. There were meats brought out on cutting boards, but when we tried asking about it, we were ignored! That was extremely rude. The market table wasn't impressive either. Maybe my expectations were too high. My husband was not impressed this being his first time...and probably his last.  Maybe Via Brasil spoiled me because this place wasn't worth the money. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Normally, I would not eat here.  But, I was with others who had a kid.  The location was across the street from my hotel.  It was good.  It was not great, and certainly was not bad.  It was good.  Waiter did a good job upselling us to get the shrimp appetizer.  It was average.  Price point is acceptable.  Service is fantastic.  Some meats tasted much better than others."}
{"text":"Restaurant week, yeah! $40.14 with dessert! Finally tried Fogo De Chao after hitting every other Brazilian Steakhouse in Las Vegas  PROS -It has probably the best quality of meat of the whole bunch, 5 stars.   -The best pao de queso, fresh and light (addicting cheese bread balls that they love you to fill up on, and I know it, yet I can't keep them away).  -Papaya dessert really hit the spot at the end, pureed papaya and cream. Excellent  CONS -The only thing lacking was the salad bar.  (No one comes to a place like this for the salad bar so I don't weigh this so heavy, but still it's nice to have something special on there.  Other places like Texas de Brazil and Via Brazil have an awesome lobster bisque to take a break from all the meat. Also Texas de Brazil has some excellent large cocktail shrimp and a little bit of nigiri sushi.  -I really love the cinnamon bananas which every steakhouse offers, but they bring them out to you at the start of the meal, unlike at the end...and by the time you want a bite of something sweet they are mushy and cold. Glad I had the papaya dessert.  - Be sure to ask for the chimmichuri sauce as it's not on the salad bar or anywhere to be found.    OVERALL Since the meat quality was the best I've seen, this place gets a solid 4 stars. I'll be returning patron...in restaurant week 2015."}
{"text":"I've been here half a dozen times overall and it's very good, but I struggle with giving them five stars after hitting their competition a mile down the road at Via Brasil last month.   WHAT'S GREAT?  The service...it's almost too good. They are always asking how you are doing, like literally 20 times per sitting. This weekend when I saw a server approach me with no meat, I asked them how they were doing before they could ask me...it got comical. The gauchos (servers) remember specifically how you like your meat and always come up ready to cut me some rare. Also, I always sit down and request to have the following: mint jelly, horseradish sauce, orange Brazilian steak sauce and chimichurri. Without fail, all 4 sauces come to my table in little bowls with spoons within minutes and I'm off to the races.   The papaya cream dessert is insanely good.  They always have $25 off discounts on their facebook page or sent to my email during certain times of the year and the small print even allows you to use multiple discounts at the same table occasionally. $50 for two? Total? Sign me up.  It's a small dining room so you don't feel like you are in a factory where they are pushing you out to clear your table for the next guests, (Hello, Texas de Brasil).  WHAT'S NOT SO GREAT?  The salad bar is lacking...I miss the cocktail shrimp of Texas de Brazil, the lobster bisque of Via Brasil and Texas de Brasil. I definitely miss the beef carpaccio of Texas de Brasil and the melted mozzarella/oregano they have at Via Brasil. They do have a peppered applewood smoked bacon which is excellent, but I'll take beef carpaccio over bacon any day.  The meat is very good but not in the great category...by no means is it pampas planet hollywood bad but I think my recent 5-star experience at Via Brasil opened my eyes comparatively.   Maybe this is great? They keep messing up the pao de queso (cheese bread) time and time again (and it is something to avoid when you hit a Brazilian steakhouse), but when it's hot and fresh, it's impossible to resist. Of the 6 times I've come here, twice they've totally forgotten it and I didn't ask, because hey, more space for meat. The other three times it was rock hard, cold and made hours prior, easy to avoid. One time they got it right and it got a hold of me like spiderman turning into the black suited spiderman. Get it off me.   Overall, I've never walked out disappointed, leaning more towards stomach pains and disorientation. The service is great, the food is very good and I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Great experience for a large group. The service was impeccable and food was fresh. They accommodated special requests and ensured everyone was taken care of."}
{"text":"\"Where do you want to go for your birthday?\" \"That place with meat on swords!\" ... Said the manly carnivore that I call my boyfriend.  Fogo totally lived up to the hype and was for sure a unique dinner.   The salad bar is epic in proportions. It's the size of my living room and family room together in length, multiplied by 2 because there's food on both sides. There were at least 10 things that I had no idea what they even were, but they were delicious vegetables or cheeses of some sort. There is a freaking barrel of parmesan cheese that you saw off a hunk yourself, for God's sake. It's amazing. I could have been happy with just the salad bar.  Then the meat. Yes, it really comes around on huge sword-like knives, and they cut you off a hunk of at your chosen temperature. I only sampled the top sirloin, rib eye and filet mignon (sad, I know), but Carnivore McGee got through 13/16 meats and by my calculations, ate over a pound and a half of meat. It was all delicious by his standards. Ladies, if you want to entertain yourself at dinner, bring your man to Fogo and watch him go from blissful looks to saying \"Must... eat... just one more piece!\" and struggling to force himself to wave away the servers.  The service was great too; we had no problems as some others did. There are a couple waiters who are actual waiters and manage drinks and checks and such, and there was always one of them within eyesight. The meat never stopped coming either, it was continuous throughout the hour we spent on that course. One of the meat servers (he's got thick wavy black hair and an accent) was a total sweetheart and chatted to me about how I liked my cocktail (one of their Brazilian sugar cane liquor ones) and educated my boyfriend on the 3 different cuts of lamb, and even ran back to the kitchen specifically to get him a sword of one of them. THAT was wonderful service.  Oh, and to take the mystery out of the prices (they don't list them... anywhere... \"If you have to ask, you can't afford it\"), here you all go:  $29.95/person at lunch, $49.95/person at dinner.  Tip: Be careful with the Caipirhinia cocktails; they are extremely strong, and they are $13.50 a pop. Some sticker shock ensued with that one when I got the bill!"}
{"text":"Wow! Made a reservation for lunch but weren't too busy when we arrived (did get busier after we started). The market table had lots of good choices. Fresh fruit, salads, cheese, meats, marinated mushrooms, olives and more. Once you are ready for the main meats you just flip over a little card and they start coming over offering whatever they have. Leg of lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, prime rib, lamb chop, sausage...etc. everything was delicious. I especially liked the leg of lamb. We also decided to get dessert. We tried the tres leches and one piece was plenty for my boyfriend and I to share. The tres leches was probably the best I've ever had. The whole meal was just incredible. If you've ever seen the movie National Lampoons European Vacation where Audrey falls asleep on the plane and has her dream where the food just keeps coming....it was kind of like that but enjoyable lol. You get a bit of lamb chop and someone comes over offering prime rib.  The servers where fantastic as well. Never had to ask for more water. Didn't have to wait for someone to come around with meat. Everyone was friendly, asking if we needed anything, did we want a specific meat brought over. This isn't just eating out this is like a whole dining experience. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yuuummmmmm!! Love this place. One of our favorites when in Phoenix. Excellent service and fantastic food. Cannot be beat."}
{"text":"How did I forget to write a review about Fogo??    I've been here twice so far, for Father's Day lunch and a date night dinner afterwards.  For Father's Day lunch, I got a gift card to come back for another free meal...awesome!  If you have never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse like this, it is essentially AYCE salad bar, cheeses, soups, etc....as well as unlimited steak, chicken, pork, and etc skewers served to you by the wait staff.  What separates Fogo from the other spots in town is the quick service, friendly staff, and meat quality.  Since it is AYCE, go ahead and try a bit of everything!  I start off with a single plate of goodies from the salad bar area, hit up some of the cheeses, soups, seafood options, and misc.  Then I head back to the table and start grabbing the good stuff as it passes by!  The most notable cuts to me are the Filet Mignon, Garlic Sirloin, House Sirloin, and Sausages.  I try the lamb cuts, chicken, and pork, but these are the powerhouses IMO!  Give em a go sometime...I guarantee you'll have an excellent time!  Pics :"}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao was very delicious. The ambiance was intimate and hardly felt like a buffet at all. The gaucho chefs were friendly and attentive. My only question is why a Caribbean dish like fried plantains is on a Brazilian menu, but whatever, they were still delicious. Also, make sure to save room for the Picanha. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Zero complaints, everything was perfect.  Love this place.  Great flavor, great service!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location and it was as good as the first time!  First, the salad bar is massive and has a lot of high end items including cheese and meats. This is probably to fill you up so you do not eat as much meat but the quality is so high my sister was able to have just the salad bar for dinner.  The sides include fried polenta sticks, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas. The fried polenta sticks were the best, they taste like a high end fry.  Now, the meat! All of the meat was excellent. The best was the house special that night which was prime sirloin. The bacon wrapped filet mignon and bacon wrapped chicken are also great. The flank steak had a great taste. They also had pork sausage, leg of lamb, parmesan pork, and sirloin steak. The meat is high quality and it never stops. At one point I was extremely full and still continued to eat because of how great it is.  This is quality and quantity for your money."}
{"text":"Fogo de chao regardless of the location is always deserving of 5 stars. I've been to the locations in NYC, LA and here in the fabulous Las Vegas.   However, this location is exciting since it's much closer to us. Even more exciting it has a patio seating area! I mean I'm still iffy on the thought of enjoying an exquisite meal on the patio but hey if the mood is right and weather is real nice you might just find me there.   This is a Brazilian steakhouse (look it up) so come ready to devour perfected, various types of beef, lamb, chicken, and sausage and more. The salad bar is filled with unlimited amounts of heavenly calorie filled \"salads\". Forget I mentioned calories because at fogo no ones counting besides your scale the next day.  A couple friends and I decided to have a casual dinner (yes we have casual dinners at Fogo). We're regulars at the flamingo location! I think we'll remain regulars at that location. The consistency there is impeccable and honestly it's worth the extra drive. If you're not a casual $$$$ dinner type then I highly recommended you check out Fogo for a special dinner. The flamingo location is more intimate. I was disappointed in the lightening at Summerlin. I like my dim lighting seating arrangement. Personal preference and personal mood will depict this for anyone. The lights were too bright and the salad bar was smaller at this new location. In addition, each table had a plastic number card? Come on now that is so tacky.   I would like to note that they were very attentive to our table hence we were 1 of 4 tables there. Also, we got there an hour before they closed. Specifically, we enjoy the lamb and we had to wait a few minutes for them to prepare it. Oh and if you're a lamb lover than don't you dare forget to order the hot sauce, jelly and chimichurri!! It'll server you right and while you're add it finish your dinner with an order of creme brûlée! Just do it and when your pants don't fit tomorrow; just remind yourself of the mouth watering dinner you enjoyed yourself. Overall, it's priceless!   (I hope my dry humor gave this review some sizzle)"}
{"text":"BEST Brazillian restaurant in Vegas!!! Hands down!!! HOWEVER, it's quite expensive BUT it's AYCE Brazillian food except the drinks of course. LoL Ambience is FABULOUS too and workers are Brazillians as well which is GREAT. PLUS I'd hate to say BUT Brazillians make the BEST flan of ALL of Latin countries."}
{"text":"Be prepared to drop some serious cash.  $60 pp for dinner, drink and dessert.  The desserts are worth skipping, in my opinion.  They were good but not great and after all that meat eating dessert was just a flat out bad idea!  Gluttony on my part, really.  Anyway, the meats were all good and since I eat my beef well done, I frequently get dried out beef.  Not here.  However, when I think about it, I would rather have spent that money in a place with more to offer than meat.  The salad bar was fresh and good, but not amazing.  I didn't even finish my salad plate...it was just ok.  The sides were ok.  I liked it, but probably won't rush back."}
{"text":"This place is very expensive, but you get your moneys worth.  I was actually taken here as a guest of my aunt and her husband and I felt very guilty because even though I do eat meat, I feel like I did not eat enough to make it worth it to bring me.    The salad bar is amazing.  Its top of the line food including mozzarella balls as big as a child's fist. The thing is, if you are there to eat meat, then don't fill up here as the big show is next.    You get coasters that on one side are red, the other side is green.  Think of a stop light, red is stop, green is go.  Men with spits of meat will walk around and ask you if you would like a cut of what they are serving.  There is beef, pork, lamb, chicken, and sauages walking around.  As long as you are flipped to green, they will keep coming.    When you are finally done with all that meat and you somehow amazingly have more room, then totally go for the desserts.  They are out of this world.  I got the tres leche cake.  So amazing.  Along with the pinot noir we got, this was a very decadent meal."}
{"text":"So delicious.   Service is awesome and unique.   If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you're missing out."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. From the outside looking in it looked great and I heard many things about it. Before this I had never been to a Fogo establishment and expected more. The Market Table is just a fancy name for a vegetable heavy buffet. I don't eat beef or pork so I opted for the Chilean sea bass. I expected it to be a little spicy or even seasoned but instead it lacked texture and the entire plate was just sweet and one note. My friend felt the same way. I orded a d'asti Moscato that was tasty and was glad I didn't want a second one as they ran out. For there to be so many staff members on the floor the service is slow and confusing. I had a waiter come to my table at least twice offering me someone else's drinks. The garlic mashed potatoes were the star of the dish. And although very slow, the servers were polite. Will I check out this place again? Probably not! Was the ambiance nice? Yes! I just don't feel like it lived up to the hype though. It's fine dinning but they're missing some of the details here. If you happen to stumble in here though their wine list is pretty nice. Because I try to end my reviews on a good note the dessert also looked nice but I by the time I finished being frustrated by my fish, I was over the experience."}
{"text":"Love this place, wonderful ambiance and great service. Expensive but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed lunch at Fogo with a friend. First time visiting the chain. Only had the market salad bar option which was only $15 at lunch time. What a deal! Such an array of high quality prepared salads and a multitude of ingredients to make your own salad. Great selection of good cheeses, meats, and vegetables. Must try the peppered bacon and cheesy croutons on the side bar where the soups are located. Excellent, efficient service...though it was busy, they promptly removed plates, replaced with clean ones. Lunch companion had the market buffet plus one meat selection. Total enjoyment of his meal including the sirloin which of course was endless and promptly replenished.  Have also hit their happy hour which has a great selection of small plates and drinks. In the lounge/bar only from 4:30-6:30 weekdays."}
{"text":"OMG best Brazilian steakhouse ever! Don't walk, RUN to this restaurant. An absolute must have! The salad bar is delicious, but it is really about the meat. *Sigh* the meat selection is not only great, but some of the best meat I have ever had. Their signature drink is amazing. The service was great! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate our anniversary,  first of all they have a complementary valet which well it's awesome !, pwe made reservations therefore we basically just had to arrive and they gave us our table super fast!!! Once we were seated the server came to us offered drinks then we went off to the salad bar which I mean had everything and anything from veggies to cheeses to cold meats and salmon, so much stuff to choose from!!! They also had other hot sides I believe I saw rice and black beans but tbh I did t try any of that so can't tell you about it, anyway we had everything and anything I mean from the lamb to chicken and steak it was all just perfectly cooked super juicy and well seasoned, we even got free dessert for our anniversary and I ordered the cream Brulê which was just freaking amazing! I seriously fell in love with this place, my drink never went below half empty, servers always up to what we were needing the (manager) or Someone came out to ask how everything was and honestly it was such an amazing experience! Will be back !!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a couple of Brazilian steakhouses and by far this is the best I have eaten at! Service was impeccable!! The food was delicious! Salad bar was fresh and clean. I also liked the fact that if you didn't want to eat all meats,you were able to substitute it out with Seabass; which was their special of the night.   It's location is in a weird place, kind of out in the middle of nowhere, but other than that it was awesome! Dress code is casual but one is more than welcome to dress nice as well!"}
{"text":"It was very good but the waiters kept bringing around the same meats and then finally they kept asking us \"any special requests?\" Well then we just have to dream up what we wanted because nobody was sure what was even being offered. It also didn't help that everyone at my table wanted well done and medium and I wanted rare- so then when they did bring something new out they kept bringing the wrong doneness to whoever requested what. But it was VERY good and we all ate more than enough. The drink menu was lacking a bit and there was no dairy free options for deserts (which when you're keeping Kosher that's important). I like Texas De Brazil better because of the salad bar. Fogo's salad bar was really lacking in comparison."}
{"text":"Love... Love... Love... this place! The food is awesome as always but the service is amazing and that's what will bring us back again. The price is also cheaper than the one in LA ($26-27 vs. $34-35 for lunch). The servers are very attentive, the side dishes are replenished constantly without being requested so we could have it fresh and hot all the time. The waiter even put on my bracelet for me without being asked after seeing me struggled a little trying to put it on myself. He also picked up and return the money that I dropped on the floor. Awesome place to be and .... oh I forgot about dessert, the flan is like giving you an orgasm in your mouth!!! And the best part was getting a tour to the back kitchen to see behind the scene action of the meat skewers mingle with the fire. Definitely coming back here on our next trip to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"This Brazilian steakhouse gave us the best dinner experience in Las Vegas. I was a little worried because I didn't know if they were going to be as good as Texas de Brazil. Well they not only were as good as them they were better!! We called and made reservations just one hour before. Brazilian steakhouses for the ones who haven't been there have some guys with big skewer with any type of meat or chicken. It's all you can eat steak, salad bar and sides.  When we arrive the friendly staff took us to our table. Our waiter gave us some suggestions for drinks and he did a great job. He recommended this Argentinean wine that has the same name of the restaurant.   We went to the salad bar and it has everything!! They even have some pasta salads and some rosted potatoes. I didn't grab that much because I knew I came for the meat!!  First we got this amazing cheese bread balls. Those are the best thing you can ever eat!! Then We got some mashed potatoes that were very tasty. Sweet plantains that were AMAZING ( we had two orders of those) they also had some corn sticks but I forgot the name.  They give you a little round sign so you tell the people if you are ready for more meat or no. I really enjoyed those guys bringing the food. They were super friendly and funny. When I didn't want something they had in the skewer they asked me what I wanted and they call out loud the guy that had it. It was hilarious because I didn't want bacon wrapped chicken and they called the guy with the flank steak  I highly recommend the ribeye, flank steak, lamb, lamb chops, sirloin. Every single one tasted wonderfully. It tasted like a little bit of heaven.  I know after all that food is Har to safe room for dessert but if you did the key lime pie is delicious and the tres leches is out of control!!  I would give this place 10 stars if I could the staff made me feel so good. The manager even came to our table and greeted. Everything was amazing. One of the best dinner experiences I have ever had. I'm definitely planning on coming back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Great traditional Brazilian attire on the servers. Very polite! Food was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"All you can eat steak.. who doesn't love that?! The concept here is wonderful, they give you a card which is what you use for your food. Green means you'd like more meat, tired of meat? Flip it over to the red. It is $52 per person, and it also includes the salad bar which the options there are also great! The cheese breads here are what I love the most! The reason behind my three stars is that the manager the night we went, blonde hair in a suit (this past today), made it a point to stop by every table to ask how things are going and if she can get them anything except our table. I find that very rude, we may be a table of the younger group but that doesn't mean we don't deserve the same attention or the respect as the tables around us. So if you're a group of 20 somethings going out to eat here, don't except the manager to stop by and ask how your food is. Definitely won't be coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 star because they lack variety at the salad bar and the food is really the same as Texas..save like $15 and go to Texas they also have better desert but if you want to spend the money it's a decent choice"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  The salad bar was good, the food was good and the meat came around promptly and was flavorful.   The one really outstanding thing about this restaurant that stands apart from many other places we go to was the customer service.   Every person that came by our table to either refill drinks, get new plates or new meats were 100% personable and good at the job   We were very impressed and plan to come many more times in the future."}
{"text":"I grew up in Brazil so if there is a Brazilian restaurant, I try to check it out.  I've been to the most of them in Socal area.  I've been meaning to try Fogo in Beverly Hills but never got around to it. So when i was in Vegas for a convention, I decided to give it a try.  And I wasn't that impressed.  The service was fantastic and the meat quality was top notch.  But it wasn't that much better than say, Agora Churracaria, M Grill, or Libra.   The feijao (black beans) was not that flavorful, the vinagrete (pico de gallo) was way too vinegary, the collard greens were not that well flavored or cooked, and they didn't have watercress, which is my favorite veggie.    I know you go for the meat, but these side dishes are crucial to my enjoyment and I expected top notch everything for  a place that charges top notch prices.  I guess I have to try the Beverly Hills location for a final verdict, but I'm not sure if it's going to be worth paying 30 more dollars for Fogo over places like Agora, M Grill, or Libra."}
{"text":"One of the best places to celebrate w family -The food is Fantastic & Service is too !  We have had several family outings here & everyone always says it is sooo delicious - & now BRUNCH !"}
{"text":"Always enjoyed Fogo, since going to one in LA.  This one is a bit less, as they do not have the same selections -desert, wine, salad bar -- as the LA location.  Went to the LA location about 14 times.  Otherwise, meat and service are quite good, and a very nice experience.  I have been to this one twice now, and sometimes the servers are better than others.  Also, sometimes the pacing can be a bit weird -- too many at once, vs the normal one at a time."}
{"text":"One thing I like about this place is that it's a nice treat after a long and stressful week. The ambiance is high class and you feel like you could be in one of those fancy dinner scenes in a movie. For $50 its unlimited Filet Mignon, lamb, beef, and other types of meat dishes that may just possibly clog your arteries. I would say starve yourself and definitely come here with an appetite. My roommate and I shared the chocolate fudge cake with vanilla ice cream on the side. Just what we needed to satisfy our sweet tooth. Overall, I would come here again, maybe once a year. Good experience."}
{"text":"The service was the best part of the dinner. I have been to Texas De Brazil and really enjoyed it much better than Fogo. The salad bar is far superior at Texas de Brazil. I also felt that the meat was a little better at Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"In love with this restaurant. Great place, very spacious, very clean and well organized. The staffs were nice and attentive.  Foods were amazing. I super love the Pão de Queijo, I could eat it everyday! Buffalo mozzarella is another treat i love. They have an extensive salad bar. They have soup and rice. Please add lobster bisque. Out of all the meat they serve, sausage is my favorite(I know Im a weirdo but hey!). Cant get enough of it. Picanha and filet mignon comes second. I dont really ask for the chicken. I should try though. Not a fan of lamb.  Ive tried the papaya cream and its oh so yummy goodness. Creme brulee is classic. For the drinks I had the traditional caipirinha and bellini caipirinha. Send more please. I spent New year's eve dinner here with families, my birthday, my husband and I's (non wedding) anniversary here. Next stop is wedding anniversary and husband's birthday. Will I ever come back? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao... what happened? We had to ask our waiter if they stopped serving meat because we didn't see any table side meat servers since we arrived and it had been a while. When the meat did come we were pretty disappointed. The quality of meat was not that great or maybe it was the way it was cooked. Salty and chewy is the best way I can describe it.   We made reservations for 1pm but due to a standoff situation with police that took place on Las Vegas Blvd. it took us almost 2 hours to get there to eat. We didn't make it to the brunch which would have been an it discounted so we paid about $200 for 2 adults and 2 kids. The amount of effort and time it took to get there, we felt disappointed with the food.    I love the downtown Los Angeles location. This location was so empty. Only saw about 4 tables occupied. My daughter said right after we were done at this Las Vegas location that she wanted to go vegan. Maybe the food is just much better in Los Angeles. There are too many option to go to a place that isn't good."}
{"text":"I realize that many businesses in Downtown Summerlin are struggling with high rents and lower than expected customer visits. I have heard this from many businesses and I can appreciate the struggle. The issue is when service or offering is terrible or declining when they offer this excuse. You must maintain the service and product offering in order to gain clientèle and loyalty. I really like this location and chain, so I hope they can pull it together.  I recently visited this location for a work lunch 9/8/17 and the restaurant was very slow (6 tables including ours) for lunch. The issue was not with the meat selection or consistency in keeping our plates full. The issue was with the \"servers\" never providing sides or requested drinks. Several members of the party ask for condiments and sides more than 3 times, and they simply never came. Two people at the table of 5 ordered non-alcoholic beverages that never came.  There were at least 3 people asking if we needed anything, but none of them actually followed through with bringing the requested items.  Stevia was requested with iced teas, and the server said that they had this - they have had this on four prior visits. It was discovered that the management now thinks its only necessary to carry sugar, sweet n low, and splenda and told me that I had to use what they carried. We decided to cancel our beverages and stick with water. The math on the up-sell of beverages, especially in a struggling restaurant, you would think they would have it together and ensure that every person ordered beverages.  The men's bathroom was dirty and needed a deep cleaning, otherwise the overall condition of the restaurant was very good.  I hope that this chain will bring in a better quality management team before this location joins the many closed storefronts in this mall."}
{"text":"Wow this place is pricey but worth it. Endless delicious cuts of meat coming back and back again were incredible. I can't wait to go back even the salad bar was amazing . I guess if you go for lunch its half the price with the same exact menu. So I'll be giving that a try but overall service was incredible. They were on top of it . The wait staff had a team mentality. The only problem now is the pain I'm in from eating too much. But I can't wait to go do it again."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife for our first year anniversary. I tried all most every kind of meat they had available. The cuts of meat were not very good and had some gristle on them. The meat was very dry and chewy. The best thing about this place is the salad bar and the polenta. If you are a fan of salad you will not be disappointed. I did like the employee's outfits. I would not visit this place again as the prices were quite high for the quality of meat I experienced."}
{"text":"Hooray for a churrascaria!  We popped into Fogo de Chao on our last day in Vegas -- making use of a killer Yelp deal we got through it's spring break promotions. $37 gave us the pleasure of having friendly men with meat on spits come by to our table and offer us delicious offering after delicious offering until our bellies split.  The house special and the parmesan pork were my favorite carnivorous offerings -- although everything I sampled was delicious and perfectly cooked. I was extremely happy with 2 different lamb offerings, and pleased that I could request more of particular cuts that I liked.  I also was severely tempted to dump a basket of the pão de queijo (cheesy popover things) into my purse. Warm, semi squishy inside -- that cheesy bread was extremely good and very very hard to put down. The polenta cakes, garlic mashed potatoes and the carmelized fried bananas were also super amazing. A meal could be made out of just the side dishes offered here! I did make a quick 'round the buffet -- nabbing only a couple nibbles of cheese and broccoli. Cuz I mean, come on! You ~are~ here for the meat.    Service was impeccable. We were promptly seated, water was immediately on the table, plates cleared when they looked a little worse for the wear, and every person --from the waiter, the cocktail lady, and the guachos were incredibly professional and friendly.    Fogo was the best and all around wonderful last meal for my Vegas vacation."}
{"text":"This was the best Brazilian steak place that I have been to. I have been to Texas de Brazil, Pampas, and some small place on paradise that I do not even remember the name to. The meats were all great tender and full of flavor.. honorable mentions go to bacon wrapped Filet mignon, leg of Lamb and the best hands down...Lamb chopps!! If you want to try a Brazilian steak place let this be it... Don't waist your time on any of the others."}
{"text":"I don't give many places 5 stars, but this place is very well deserving. Great food and service. Very friendly staff. The salad bar was nothing short of amazing and all meats are cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Meat is what they do. They constantly bring by different meats so you won't go hungry. The portions though are so small, I doubt very many people ever get their moneys worth. Oh well. The service is good but not good enough for the price you pay. For the money, I'd rather go to a  good steak house."}
{"text":"Perfect meat ! Perfect sides! Sooo worth the money . I love it!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. House sirloin, rib eye, bacon wrapped chicken were killer. Sweet bacon at the salad bar is a must.  Great atmosphere. Seated promptly.  Enjoyable and filling evening for us all."}
{"text":"We have to throw out kkdkat F's review. What the hell is it with people reviewing a business that isn't open yet?  My experience was fortunately when they were open. I went Saturday night, their third day open, and it was a glorious night. I missed the 6:30 reservation but still only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. They were very accommodating with my friends 2 year old and did not charge us for her to sit at the table and eat scraps of his food. If you have never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse (as I hadn't) it is a ridiculous idea. You flip the card to green when you want food, and red when you don't want food. Problem is that the food guys come so much that a mere 45 seconds of \"green\" will have your plate full of more meat than you could possibly consume. To offset this meat bonanza, they do offer a salad bar.   The place kind of reminds me of a Golden Corral, but upscale, where you don't have to get it yourself. The clientele is old, overweight, and un-sophisticated as you would expect at an all you can eat restaurant. The price ($42.50) is high enough only to discourage the dredges of society. I saw quite a few younger people out on dates, probably not ones that would have the palate to appreciate even restaurants at half this cost.   The salad bar alone ($19) was more than well enough equipped. Featuring 8-10 different salads, raw vegetables, and a few cold cuts. Each meal includes three sides that are shared family style, a fried banana, mashed potatoes, and polenta which are all replaced the moment you finish one. The trick if you do not want another, is to leave a bite of it on the platter. They wont replace it if it isn't finished. They also bring the most delicious bread imaginable that has a warm, gooey, cheesy center. The two year old ate 6 of them.  Meat service includes 15 different types of meat here, of which I tried about 8 and they were all on the decent to good range. The only exception to it being the lamb chop which we both agreed was the loser of the bunch, with the favorite being either the bacon wrapped filet, garlic beef, or the parmesan encrusted pork chop. All items are served in small portions, enabling you to try several different ones. I don't think I had two of anything. It is definitely a huge meal and my recommendation is to eat nothing all day, and then be very concerned what your cardiologist might say afterward.   The restaurant is probably going to last through this depression at least, as they serve in high volume and turn a lot of tables. It isn't uppity enough to turn away the low end clientele, and it isn't crappy enough to turn away the affluent folks. The service is spectacular. I don't think I asked for one thing all night, and the food is good. My only gripe is the meats were all very well cooked, which is obviously a testament to most peoples tastes and not wanting to actually taste the meats. It would have been nice to have a \"rare\" option, but the did decline the request."}
{"text":"I love this place. MY only problem is, i keep the card on the green side and i get more meat on my plate than i can handle. lol But the customer service is great. If you haven't saw a certain meat you like in a while. They will ask you what would you like and they will bring out that meat for you. I love this place."}
{"text":"Wtf why is this place so highly rated? In my opinion the pork chop and the sirloin tasted awful and the food overall was not worth the price. Most of their cuts were very fatty and overly charred. The bacon was good. That's about it really besides the service which was fast as the guys served me nasty meat on the reg."}
{"text":"BEST SERVICE EVER!!  Our server was Luis and the manager in our section was Kappa. I'm a server myself and I've been to several \"nicer\" restaurants but this is by far, my favorite place!! Well first, the food was really good and personally, I'd recommend the garlic steak the most and I loved the bacon from the salad bar thing.   Okay, in terms of service, every single person who came to our table was so friendly and completely catered to us. For example, a guy came up offering steak but didn't have medium well and later came back and REMEMBERED us and gave us the medium well steak we originally wanted. Our server also remembered everything we asked for and ensured that we got the steaks we asked for. The manager Kappa gave us brand new plates (since our current ones were dirty) and even though we said \"oh it's okay we're almost done anyway\" he said \"no you are my guests and deserve the best\" then gave us brand new plates and a whole refill on our plates.  Our server, Luis was extremely friendly and the hostess was also very prompt and helpful. Overall, everyone was very attentive and GREAT! Thanks for a great dinner and first dinner in Vegas"}
{"text":"There are some meals that you have that you know you will remember for years to come. This was my experience at Fogo de Chao.  I had the good fortune to join a longtime friend who had done very well at the tables earlier that day. This meant that our meal started with the best possible aperitif: a 2 oz pour of MacCallan 30, which pretty much went into a barrel when I was born. This now entitles me to a little bit of a humblebrag: Don't have 30-year-old scotch, because it will make enjoying anything less FAR more difficult.  Onto the meal. Skip the salad bar, as you will want as much room as possible for the wonderful meats. I have listed them here in order of preference. Full disclosure, however: our wine pairings took this meal from excellent to legendary. We had an '08 Brunello and then an '06 Insignia Meritage. Also not recommended if you ever want to enjoy red wine again.   LOMBO (parmesan-crusted pork loin) - This was an incredible dish. Tender, juicy, perfectly prepared pork, and with just the right amount of parmesan covering the pork loin to flavor it and add a bit of texture.  FILET MIGNON - this is my go-to dish at pretty much any steakhouse, and although I normally like mine prepared medium, it's only the upscale places that do medium-rare that I still eat. So I asked for medium-rare, and got a piece that I was slightly uncomfortable with visually, but it was STILL amazing. It's also served wrapped in bacon, and while I like bacon, the filet by itself is outstanding.  CORDEIRO (lamb leg) - this comes as both leg of lamb, and lamb chops. I only had the leg, and it was divine. Not even a hint of gaminess.  FRALDINHA (bottom sirloin) - It never occurred to me that \"top\" sirloin had a \"bottom\" counterpart, but this was it. It's incredibly well-marbled and, for someone who is careful to cut out any extra fat visible on any cut of meat, I didn't leave a trace of this behind.  PICANHA (top sirloin) - I had the garlic-seasoned version of this dish, and while it was very good, it was still outdone by the dishes above. Apparently it's one of their signature offerings, but it kind of got lost in everything else that was at or above its level.  There were plenty more meats that came by our table, but after the above I skipped most of them. Word to the wise: don't come to a place like this and take up valuable stomach space on chicken.  For dessert, we had the flan -- very good and with a generous amount of sauce. But the fried bananas can easily be your dessert here.  Our service was excellent. I was with company that knew a LOT about wine, and he was impressed with how each of the servers (not just the sommelier) knew a lot about the selections we had made. We felt very well taken care of, as was sort of expected, and very much appreciated.  This wasn't just a dinner. It was an experience, and an unforgettable one at that."}
{"text":"We came for our holiday luncheon with a group of 21+ and we had Minh as our server. Great service!!!! He was on top of our service and taking our drink orders in a timely manner! Excellent customer service :)"}
{"text":"I have never try before Brazilian food, so my husband brought me to this place for our anniversary!! I'm so happy he did, food was fantastic, service was great all very nice people!!  I'm so glad we come here!! Thank to my hubby!!"}
{"text":"Props to Cameron for the nice service he provided during our brunch yesterday.  He was observant but not pushy, and always made sure we had what we needed to enjoy our meal.."}
{"text":"CHEATING!!! FRAUD!!! I went to the restaurant for dinner with my family that night and paid the bill with my credit card. Three days later, I checked my credit card record, then I found out that THEY CHARGED EXTRA TIPS AFTER I PAID. The check was $141.00, I only wrote $20 tips on the receipt and also indicated the total amount for $161.00, but on my bank statement shows the charged  for this is $191.00, which means they charge me $50 for tips without notice."}
{"text":"I have been to 6 different locations in different cities..never had such a bad experience..this place is horrible. -cheese bread was cold -salad bar was messy and half empty -tabbouli had no flavor -service was very bad -worst meat service ever (3 slices in 1 hour) -cheap meat selection -Chicken was very salty  I do not recommend this location at all.. the one on flamingo is much better."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I'm not a cheap person, Just the price of everything is crazy! 52 dollars for each person for all you can eat. I just don't think spending $15 for one shot single alcoholic drink was worth it. My bill came to almost $200 last night, and for that I feel like my experience should've been better. They say they have a ton of meat selection but I honestly felt like pass the same few cuts around. They kept asking me and my boyfriend if I wanted the bottom steak. For about 5 mins give or take we were asked 3 times if we wanted the bottom steak. On top of everything I love lamb...the guy who was passing out the bone in lamb COMPLETELY passed us like looked our way and walked away (I thought maybe he didn't see our green sides up but we placed them on the end of our table) We had to flag down one of the waiters to ask if we could get a piece of lamb. For what our bill was it was NOT worth it. It is just overpriced."}
{"text":"They know how to do meats.  I can't think of a single thing that wasn't great about this meal.  The only negative I can possibly think of is that nagging feeling in the back of my mind that it is just . . . too. . . . much. Just too much of everything. The whole experience constitutes a sort of embarrassment of riches.  But that's what celebrations are about, and thus this is a great place for a celebration."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we came here for our romantic date night while in Arizona. The food was yummy and just got some one on one time with my guy."}
{"text":"If you are on a Paleo diet this is the place.  Plenty of meat, it can be overwhelming at times.  I cannot believe I ate so much steak that once I went back to my Hotel room I fell into a meat coma.  I woke up the next day and Saturday night disappeared.  What a waste of a Saturday night.  Good thing I was in Vegas and every night is a party night."}
{"text":"We went to our favorite spot on Christmas Day which is Scottsdale's Fogo du Chao.  Juao the manager, was kind enough to honor the Veteran's Holiday Discount for my son, I, and my wife.  They lived up to their fine reputation of outstanding food and service! Outstanding as usual!!!! Thank you Juao!"}
{"text":"This is meat nirvana, and the best Brazilian-style steakhouse I have visited.  I started with a Brazilian beer in the bar, then met up with several friends for dinner here on Saturday night.   We all had a great time trying the 15 different cuts of meat, the unusual salad bar, and the sides of potatoes and plantains (which are all included for under $50). My personal favourites were the filet, ribeye, and the \"house beef\"."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my husbands family for Christmas, the best part was the bread and the chicken wrapped in bacon. Delicious. My biggest problem was that the meats were so unbelievably salty! My eight year old who loves her steak couldn't stomach it. Personally I feel as though they over salt so that it makes you thirsty, therefore your constantly having to drink and getting full off the liquid vs the meat. Way overpriced unless your seriously going slam down a ton of meat helpings. It's a cool experience but nothing I'd go back to again. If I'm going to spend money on a delicious steak I'm going to del friscos."}
{"text":"I would seriously recommend not eating breakfast if you get the lunch special here. Its pretty affordable at $25. I love the steak and buffet styles sides."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. I tend to shy away from Brazillian steakhouses for one main reason; I am extremely fussy about my cuts of meat. It is undoubtedly from my childhood, where my parents would by cheap, fatty/gristly cuts of meat, and make me so there until I cleaned my plate. So I developed such an aversion to fatty/gristly meat, that even as an adult, my gag reflex kicks in when I bite into a piece of meat, and am met with any kind of resistance. (OK, I am fully aware that this is an awful way to start a review of a steakhouse, but bear with me;) So given this parameter, I've probably only been to 2 of these meat-palaces in my entire adult life, (up until now) and neither was a good experience, so I just wrote them off as not-my-thing. So, last week, a business associate gave my wife a $100 gift card to Fogo, and we decided one night, what the heck, it's free, so we went, not expecting much at all. First, we got there early, probably around 5-ish on a week night, so there was no crowd, and no wait. Upon walking in, the hostess was very polite, attentive, and professional. We were seated quickly, interacting with a few different people, server, water guy, bread guy, drink lady, etc...and every one of them was more professional than the last. Just a top notch staff, which is becoming increasingly rare these days. Upon looking around, I noticed that the venue was huge, featuring 2-3 private dining rooms in addition to the main room that we were in. The next thing I noticed was that the whole place was immaculately clean, and tastefully decorated in warm woods. Somebody spent a fortune on this interior, most notably, the decorative use of wood in the ceiling treatment. Really pretty, and gave the room a friendly, inviting feel. It was explained to us that we could go enjoy the salad bar at our leisure, and when we were ready for meat service to start, simply flip our indicator over from the red side, to the green side, which will indicate to the servers to start bringing over meat to sample. We started with the salad bar, and I'm about to make a bold statement, but I dare say that this could be the best salad bar in all of Las Vegas. A large, classy, 4-sided bar, featuring an incredible assortment of very high-quality foods, creatively and tastefully displayed and prepared. I literally could have made this my entire meal, and did indeed contemplate it given my weird meat phobia, but decided When-in-Rome, and flipped my card to green, so beginning the meat service. There were probably 10-12 meat choices in all, and I'll admit that my choices were very conservative. I stuck mainly to lean beef choices like sirloin, 2 different types of filet, and a lean, center cut of ribeye. I carefully asked for very thin slices, and admittedly trimmed the fatty edges off, as I am programmed to do. But I must say, I ate a lot of meat that night, and everything I ate was flavorful, tender, juicy, and delicious. I cautiously avoided the lamb, sausage, and most other cuts that were foreign to me, but absolutely loved everything I ate. We didn't order dessert, but they brought us a complimentary flan anyway, which was so creamy, we ate the whole thing. I absolutely loved this place. I never would have come here if someone hadn't handed me a gift card, and now I'll certainly be back, so that was clever and effective marketing on someone's part. Kudos."}
{"text":"Oh My GOD  The garlic sirloin and filet were to die for.  The other meats were good, but nothing compares to those first two.   The lamb was okay,  bacon wrapped chicken a bit on the dry side.  The candied bacon at the salad bar?!? I would come back for that alone.   It's  $49.95 per person, which includes salad bar, mashed potatoes, plantains, etc. and all of the meat you can eat.  I made one trip up for salad and skipped everything else but meat. It's a great deal if you bring your appetite, but if you're not expecting it, that group check is scary.   Cocktail prices are cleverly omitted from the drink menu,  the single, small mixed drink I had weighed in at $13.  Ouch.  This is a definite must-visit in Scottsdale, and next time I'm in the area I am DEFINITELY returning."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a Chef and Im a manager at different restaurants, so we know good service when we get it. Tonight,  our server ( I can't remember her name but she was brunette,  beautiful and I think Brazilian) was SO great,  very friendly and attentive. Minh, the manager stopped by multiple times to check on us and the entire staff was so nice! The food was amazing and we loved the entire experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I don't give anyone a 5, but this was to die for. Scrumptous. The service was impeccible. Lovely, lovely time. Thank you !"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place out.  After years of knowing about it and not doing anything about that I got my day.  Meat!  Lots and lots of delicious meat!    The salad bar was great, but I knew that I didn't come here for that.  I tried my best to be brief at the bar, but I couldn't resist.  Wonderful selection of veggies and cheeses.  Smoked salmon as well.  The hearts of palm were crunchy, the artichoke hearts were wonderful.  I was in love, but I was ready for meat.  First they clear your plate and throw down some side dishes.  Truthfully none of the sides looked tempting.  It was a small portion, but I bet if we wanted more, we'd get it.    The second you flip that button to allow meat, they come running over.  Skewers upon skewers of meat.  All of them were wonderful but some were better than others.  Stay away from the bacon wrapped filet and Parmesan crusted pork.  Both were not that good.  I also noticed that I prefer the meat when it's straight out of the flame.  If it sits around more than 15 minutes, it's not as good.  What I really liked about the place was the service.  Top notch.  They let us know right away that they work as a team.  So if we didn't see the server that first waited on us, we could ask anyone.  That was true.  There were about 6 people helping us at all times.  What I didn't like about the place was I felt a little rushed.  The rest of my party was done eating and I was still trucking.  Not only did they clear the table while I was still eating, the waiter even presented the desserts.  Dessert was the last thing on my mind while they were still bringing me meat.    However the dessert (if you can make it) were spectacular.  We had the creme brule and the molten chocolate cake.  Both were fabulous.  Overall, I'd come back here again and again and again.  It was wonderful"}
{"text":"Treated my friend here yesterday for a birthday lunch. The salad bar was great, the cuts of meat were mostly amazing, and for most of it, the service wasn't too shabby either.   In my opinion the lamb t-bone, small chicken legs, and bacon wrapped filets were the best of the meat they brought around. Other cuts ranged from \"great\" to \"dry\". And boy did they bring around they meats. I was a little worried that going there for late lunch they'd have a limited selection, or stuff wouldn't be as hot & fresh, but that's not something you should worry about.   The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review was the service at the end. The check never came, and we had to flag someone down - which by itself is a passable offense - but also, I made a special comment when booking online that I was taking my friend out for his birthday and they never made any mention of it, which was extremely disappointing. I even saw a sticky note when we were being seated that said, \"note: BDAY!\"  I don't know if either of us could have handled dessert had they offered, but they could have offered him a drink on the house or something. Or at least said \"enjoy your birthday.\"  Loved the meal, was sad for it to end on a disappointing note."}
{"text":"So good and definitely worth the price for lunch at $35. I was literally full after 10 min. Good selection of apps including fatty carbs like potato salad, chicken salad. On the other side was a selection of salads like tabouleh which was tasty. They also had manchego cheese which is worth the calories. My fav meat by far was the filet. It's definitely upscale which is probably why they didn't have fountain drinks and instead just little cute bottles. Overall they have Really good quality beef with the perfect amount of fattyness and seasoning."}
{"text":"Incredible! Some of the best meat I have ever had, nice atmosphere and excellent and attentive service. Can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"For a first time visit the overall experience was great! The meats were cooked well, the choices were good, and the wait staff was courteous and always available.   My only complaint would be that it seemed that the order in which they brought out the food was from the least expensive to the most... So they wanted you to fill up on the chicken and sirloin before they ever came out with lamb or fillets... which was disappointing - since we are a family of lamb lovers.   The little sausages & chicken legs were gamey. Other than that the seasoning & flavors were great and the char cooking was tasty.   The salad bar is amazing, with a huge selection of fresh fruits, veggies, salads, and other items like smoked salmon and proscuitto... fresh motzarella... mouthwatering as a meal in itself.   Overall I loved it and would go back in a snap!"}
{"text":"Pricey but worth every last dollar. Absolutely delicious. If you ever want to splurge a little on a night out, this is definitely a recommendation.  Carnivore's paradise, and unlike other AYCE experiences, the food is all top quality. Obviously, you will never leave hungry."}
{"text":"My favorite Brazilian steakhouse. Their meat does not even compare to any other of the other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to. Great selection at the salad bar and good fried plantains."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about how exceptional our experience was! My wife and I went for our anniversary, we had such variety of meat we couldn't keep up! I recommended the lamb and braised chicken, you will leave stuffed.  First thing is you need to come prepared, don't eat all day. Second you need to know its all about the meat. Fogo will bring cooked meat to your table and cut it right off the skewer. Full size salad bar with all the toppings, and the servers were more than accommodating. Nestled in an upscale Scottsdale Plaza it really fits the mark of High End Brazilian spa steakhouse . We will be coming again !  Recommended for Special nights out with your SO - 4.97 Stars"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 10 to celebrate my 30th birthday. Felt like VIPs when we pulled up in our super stretch limo! This was my 2nd time dining here so I knew it would be good. It was Saturday night and they were busy. Our table was all the way in the back. After our server explained how everything worked and took our drink order, we made our way to the salad & sides bar. There I found scalloped potatoes, red potatoes, rice & beans, and some imported cheese (I skipped the veggies). Some delicious warm cheese bread was brought to our table. Before long, several folks from my party were ready for meat and flipped their cards to the green side. It's like they opened the flood gates! Several servers rushed over, one after the next, to offer a variety of meats. Their plates filled quickly. They also brought out polenta (fried cornmeal), garlic mashed potatoes (which don't taste like garlic), and delicious caramelized bananas. By the time I was ready for meat and flipped my card over, the service had slowed. It's like I missed the window! So I had to wait a bit to be served. I ended up with filet mignon, bacon-wrapped chicken, bacon-wrapped steak, sausage, and parmesan pork. Everything was yummy! My only complaint was that everyone was seated so close to one another that we had to lean off to one side so the servers could come between us to serve the meat. Kind of annoying. During the meal, I decided I wanted to order a pina colada, but our waiter was nowhere to be found. He really abandoned us for awhile. My sister and her husband went over to the bar to get drinks. Eventually someone came over so we could order drinks. Once I finally got the pina colada, it was delicious. As we were finishing our meal, a dessert menu was placed in front of me and I was told I could choose a complimentary dessert for my birthday! I was full, but I couldn't pass on a free dessert. I was surprised to see how many choices there were! But I had to go with the strawberry cheesecake. They brought it out with a candle and \"happy birthday\" written in strawberry sauce. The slice was huge too! I took a bite and passed it around the table so everyone could try it. It was so good! I think it made two full rounds before it was gone. It was a VERY expensive meal, although the coupon I had received for my birthday helped a little bit. I enjoyed my birthday dinner and I think this is a great place to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is the third Brazilian steakhouse restaurant that my husband and I have tried and it is the best thus far.  The service was great.  They servers were very observant.  At the other Brazilian steakhouse restaurants, I found the chicken and pork to be really salty, but here it was just right.  All the meats were perfect and would melt in your mouth.  I don't normally like lamb, but here it was quite tasty.  They had a good selection on wine.  It was our anniversary when we came here and I had put that note under the reservation online and when we ordered dessert they had written Happy Anniversary on the plate.  We've never had another place do that for us before and it's the little things that count.  It was a great experience with great food."}
{"text":"Yummmmm - don't be fooled though. They'll bring you sausage and chicken early on... But don't be fooled! Just wait for the good stuff. STEAK."}
{"text":"Full disclosure I am a vegetarian. However, I'm not one of those walk in the room and declare to everyone I'm vegetarian. Instead I'm the quiet kind that surprises my coworkers by asking to join them for lunch. I happen to know steakhouses often have amazing sides to compliment the meat so when the opportunity presented itself I was definitely in.   Fogo did not disappoint. The salad bar had lots of delicious veggie friendly options. Everything was well prepared and fresh.   What made me really enjoy this place was while it was upscale it was never stuffy and the service was impeccable. If you are eating meat you have a little card you place red side up when you want to be passed over and green when you want the server to come over. When my coworkers cards were green I don't think they ever waited more than a minute for someone to cut off a piece of meat. This was one of my coworkers first visits and he said everything was delicious but his favorite was the Parmesan pork."}
{"text":"Another awesome meal at Fogo de Chao, it was every bit as good as the one in Orlando.  Great service, excellent food, large variety of proteins, excellent dessert to finish off the perfect tasting meal.  I can't find a single thing I didn't like about this place, so glad we had reservations as there was a line out to the street. It was NASCAR weekend in Vegas and some convention that attracted 150,000 people alone.   I highly recommend this place to people that like Tucanos, Rodizios, Texas de Brazil, and Brazza Grill for Utah folk."}
{"text":"**** My 200th Review! ****  Fogo de Chao I believe loosely translates to \"Meat Tornado\". I was warned by a friend not to fill up on the salad bar and starchy side dishes before the carnivorous category F5 engulfed the table in a dizzying barrage of beef, lamb, chicken, and pork.    There are 16 different types of meat brought to your plate. You can control the flow of the meat parade by using a little stop-n-go coaster, but who wants to stop the meat parade?  Highlights for me were: anything lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, the garlic beef, and the mashed potato side dish (seriously good).   Lowlights for me were: the sirloins, the pork sausage, the corn fritter things, and the emptiness of salad-type salad bar options.   The staff were top notch, even for a bunch of younger dudes, they communicated well and were very professional. Well done sirs. We had an excellent wine pairing. They brought out a nice desert for our birthday girl and everyone left a little more swollen than when they came in. On a side note, go to the salad bar last, what my friend called \"the pusher\" and steer clear of their bathrooms unless you want to hear guttural sounds the likes of which you can never un-hear."}
{"text":"roughly $60 per person brazilian buffet...starting at self-serve salad bar...handsome spread of vegetables, shrimp, cured meats, olives and more...meats carved at table side...sausages, chicken, beef, lamb, etc...lamb good...meats can be tough, so be selective...great salad bar...great sides..love the cooked plantains..decent typical meats..."}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing! All the meat was cooked to perfection and had an amazing flavor. Hands down one of my new favorite places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Expect to have an excellent dining experience when eating at Fogo. If you've never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse before, it's essentially an all you can eat buffet where some of the food comes to you. There are people walking around with spears of meat of all types: garlic chicken, flank steak, filet mignon, lamb chops, etc. they eventually come to your table and ask you if you want any (answer should usually be yes). Everything else that you eat with the meat (veggies, fruits, rice, soup, beans, cold cuts, etc) can be found in a buffet table nearby. Fogo's food quality is amazing. Their meat is very well prepared and amazingly seasoned. The food in the salad bar is also delicious and complements the meat well. My advice is just to try everything, even a little bit of everything if you want to share with someone else at your table.   The ambience of the place is pretty classy. I'd probably dress up whenever I come here to eat and eat here in special/celebratory occasions.   My family came here because we had coupons and because it also my mom's birthday. Our server was very nice and even gave us free dessert since we were out celebrating."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome? The Garlic Sirloin and The Filet Mignon were my Favorites. The House Sirloin and Lamb were very good as well. The salad bar was amazing. I enjoyed the Kale salad, the Tabouli Salad and the Rice and beans were delicious. The also have dried meats and cheeses. Definitely another must have whenever your in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fogo has never failed me! I love this place so much. The food is fantastic, and the service is outstanding. They will top off your glass of water after you take a sip out of it & make sure you're able to get all the meats that you want to eat. The meat is always so flavorful.   When I came here a few weeks ago, they never refilled us with sides. Which are the mashed potatoes, fried polenta, etc. And the mashed potatoes didn't taste very good here.   Overall, it is always a great experience & the food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Fogo. My coworker and I talked about eating here for a good 3 months. When we finally had time to grab lunch together, this was the first place to come to mind! The salad and cheese bar is always great. Everything is gresh. But the best part about fogo is definitely their churrascaria experience! You get a flip card, one side is green and The other side is red. You flip to the green side when you're ready & flip it to red when you have enough meat on your plate or need a break!  The meat is always seasoned perfectly. There's workers who walk around with meat on a stick that come fresh off the grill. They ask how well you like your meat cooked & they slice is right off for you tableside. They also bring you sides which include mashed potatoes, fried polenta & fried bananas. Also, their bread is to die for. It's nice and crispy on the outside and nice and chewy, soft, cheesy & buttery on the inside. They literally just melt in your mouth. Very addicting!   They also offer a few other dishes if you're not big on the red meats or don't want the full churrascaria experience. You can also just dine here for the salad bar alone as well.   During their lunch service, it is slightly cheaper than dinner & they serve a most of the same cut of meat during lunch that they serve during dinner. Service was very quick here in the beginning as we sat down. After about 15 minutes, service started to slow down. Which was weird because the restaurant was only about 20% full at the time."}
{"text":"Best food around! Not to mention the service!!! Norma was legit, the best waitress that's served me. Being from out of town, I highly recommend this to anyone in the area wanting to try something new!!! Make sure you give yourself a solid hour to spend here, trust me, you'll need it!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here, was very excited, went out with a group of 14, starts off with the waiter asking if anyone wanted Shrimp I said yes, he decided to put out two full plates for THE WHOLE table, after it was chomped up by everyone I find out it was only billed to me. VERY VERY DECEIVING! So the shrimp was not up to par and most of the meats were average to say the best. The bar was ok, service was not anything special either. For my liking and money I much rather go to any Buffet on the Strip the food quality is the same and you will save a bunch of cash!"}
{"text":"Go here hungry. I got filled up so quick. I wanna go back to savor each meat they bring out. Definitely worth the money. Great experience."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Great service.  Great food.  Not sure what else to say.  If you have not been to Fogo de Chao, you should go.  Beware of 'food coma' after eating here.    ;-)"}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Fogo Las Vegas. We've been to 6 other locations. Our experience was nothing shy of excellence! As with all the other locations!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for an association meeting on a Thursday night.   - Great venue. Lots of seating.  - Love the salad bar, but not just salad. Salmon, artichoke hearts, asparagus, bacon! Many more.  - Excellent service.  - Average tasting white wine.  - Great quality meats. Chicken, pork, beef, lamb. I didn't get the sausage.  - Steak medium. Perfect char.  - No left over charge. I took a bite of a few meats. I know, Africa.... - Waiters made rounds 2x.  - Flan was questionable. haha.  - Limited Parking. Almost 50% self and 50% valet."}
{"text":"I was reading my first review for Fogo from a year ago and it was drier than a  well-done steak!  Fogo is one of my favorite chain restaurants.  I come here a lot and this week, I came here twice...listen to the Duchess (as I'm rolling me eyes at people who make dukedoms a big deal! Haha!)!  This place beats the other churrascarias in town in terms of meat selections, cleanliness and service.  If you want a particular kind of meat, just tell one of the gaucho guys or any of the servers.  As they say here \"we work as a team\".  They won't wait until your glass is empty. It's cheaper if you go during lunch time but you don't get beef ribs.  I'm a big carnivore.  People laugh at me hysterically when I think about becoming vegetarian.  This place is actually great for both carnivores and herbivores.  Although you'll get your money's worth if you eat steaks than just get stuff from the salad bar.  They give you fried polenta, mashed potatoe, fried bananas (helps you cut the fattiness of the meats) and pao de queijo/ cheese bread/ popovers.  THE MEATS: They recently added Fogo steak to their meat line-up - it has a thicker layer of fat.  Picanha/house special top sirloin, bottom sirloin, filet, rib eye, alcatra, filet wrapped in bacon, chicken, chicken breast wrapped in bacon, leg of lamb, lamb chops, beef ribs (not available during lunch), garlic sirloin, pork loin, pork ribs, sausage and rib eye.  My favorites are: garlic sirloin (very garlicky), picanha (thin layer of slightly crisp fat) and bacon-wrapped filet...all cooked medium rare, of course.  All meats are tender and flavorful.  THE SALAD BAR: They have soup, tabbouleh, beans and rice. Non-veggie items: bacon, cheeses (parmesan, mozzarella, manchego), salami, prosciutto and smoked salmon.  Veggies: lettuce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, heart of palm, artichoke bottoms, peppers, etc. with different salad dressings (I like basil pesto). Last night, I had a crazy idea of just doing the salad bar.  I survived not eating steaks but I know I over-payed for a loaded plate of veggies, smoked salmon, bacon, cheese, prosciutto and a basket of pao de queijo for $28.  THE DRINKS: My favorite is their Brazilian lemonade.  It's lime juice blended with condensed milk...it's non-alcoholic but it's way better than it sounds.  I get this all the time...free refills!  You have to have a caipiranha or two.  Last night, I had a Strawberry Lemonade Acai Caipiranha...it was strongly delicious.  It has Acai Spirit, Grand Marnier, Sprite, lemon and muddled strawberries.  I would also recommend the Melon Coconut Lime Caipiranha - coconut rum, cachaca, melon liqueur and muddled lime.  THE DESSERTS: Papaya Cream, Strawberry Cream, Key Lime, Flan, Molten Chocolate Cake...but my absolute favorite is their South American Flan (tastes just like how my mom used to make it). It's creamy and sweet...very delicious!  The basics: if you're still eating your salad or if you're not ready for meaty goodness, flip your card red side up.  If you want meat to keep coming, flip the card green side up.  If you don't like a certain kind of meat and a gaucho guy approaches you, you may politely refuse.  You don't have to keep using the same plate.  If you're just doing the salad bar, don't freak out when they take away your flip card and tongs - you won't need those. They have private rooms if you have special occasions/ meetings.  I've used them before and it was great. Obrigada!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Fogo for years. The quality and quantity of options are great and aplenty. The service is always good. However, I can't say the same about this location.  We had a reservation for dinner on a Sunday because we figured it would be packed. All Fogo locations I've been to are always busy. But we probably didn't need one for this place because they had lots of empty tables. There was no hostess in sight for a good 5-10 minutes. The salad bar is smaller and had limited offerings.  I normally get a Brazilian lemonade to wash down all the food I devour. Those things are simple and easy to make (you can find the recipe online). But you can tell they used whole limes rind and all because the lemonade was super bitter. They didn't use enough condensed milk otherwise, the drink would've been frothy and sweeter. Blecchhh! I asked for another glass of lemonade and it was worse than the first one.  On with the food...if you want a specific type of meat, you can ask for it and they'll have it to you in a few minutes. Not at this location. \"It'll be an hour and a half because we slow roast it\" said two different gauchos at different occasions. I get the slow roasting part but were they not expecting to feed people? And the pao de queijo (cheese bread) also took forever.  I feel guilty for giving this place a bad review. It feels like a 2-star experience but I love Fogo although this particular location didn't really seem like a Fogo. I'll just stick to the Flamingo location."}
{"text":"excellent as always.  A great dining experience if you like meat.  five stars for consistency.  I have had the same dining experience in Sao Paolo, Brazil, Minneapolis, MN, Atlanta, GA and Las Vegas, NV.   Usually, I would consider this boring and typical of chain restaurants like Chilli's, but when the experience is so AWESOME, you want it to be repeated and they deliver!!"}
{"text":"I always love fogo de Chao.  The summerlin location was our fav unfortunately it is closed now.    This interior of this location is very dark & very loud.    The servers seems very BUSY.  Our server came to check on us once for a while, but he's in a rush all the time, I guess it was a busy night.  My only complaint is, the meat servers didn't circle around as often as it had before.  Wish we got to try more varieties.  But overall, everything else is good.   Food is delicious as always!"}
{"text":"Good food. I went in for lunch and they have a cery nice variety. I would definitely recommend it and go back."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this location. I recall enjoying Fogo de Chao on the east side, so I was excited to try a new location close to my house. The meat was just not very good quality. The service was decent. Overall a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  This was our second time around, and everything is just wonderful.  Along with the wide variety of meats they serve three side dishes that consist of mashed potatoes, polenta and plantains.  They also serve warm cheese bread to go with your meal.  The polenta and cheese bread are to die for.  Servers are always attentive and replace sides and cheese bread as needed or.  The meat is succulent, cooked really appropriately.  There were times I felt the seasoning was a little off, but I am known to be a salt freak.    The way it works:  They have you start with the salad bar.... Resist the urge, there's so many yummy meats you will want to eat.  If you must, there is a wide variety of veggies, cheeses and other anti pasto to choose from (keep this light).    When ready for meat service, simply flip your green/red card green and servers will immediately bring you your sides, and new plates for your meats.  As long as your card is green the meat servers will stop by your table and offer you meat - use the provided tongs to grab meat."}
{"text":"After three days of lolling around being indolent I decided it was high time to get down to business and eat as many animals as humanly possible. Fogo recognized this basic gluttonous urge and, luckily, provided a veritable farm for me to eat.   Right off the bat I decided to prime my tummy with a caipirinha, which was strong and delicious and the perfect prelude to the meat storm about to go down. I mostly passed on the salad bar - I did have some marinated veggies and a little tabbouleh, so I could feel like I was at least getting a tiny bit of plant matter in - but the cheeses and cold cuts and salads all looked pretty yummy. When the pao de queijo came I hoovered those suckers like Pac-Man hoovers dots. And then I leveled up to the meats. Ohhhhh, the meats. All kinds of beef, pork, lamb, chicken - the best were the picanha (house cut) and the lombo (parmesan encrusted pork loin) but all were delicious. And kept coming. And coming. And coming. And coming. Until my belly was looking at least eight months pregnant and panting, exhausted, I could eat no more.   Is it gross to eat that much meat? I mean, objectively, yes. For sure. It's a wild excess and I probably shouldn't feel good about it. But the friendly gaucho servers, bus boys, hostess just made it a wonderful dinner that I felt great about. Except for the teensiest bit of trepidation while pondering how such profligacy would play out in my digestive system. Worth it!"}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian, you will be very happy with the Market Table ($15), you can get anything from this great spread full of plenty of fresh and grilled veggies, there's also plenty of cheese and bread, delicious salads, huge variety, fresh fruit, and much more. There were some side items on separate tables, beans (contained meat) and a wonderful tomato soup that was totally meat free. The quality is superb! All the waiter/waitresses were very knowledgable about what did and did not contain any meat which was very much appreciated. We were stuffed with the Market table, but we had the opportunity to try an entree and we chose the Sea Bass and Salmon alternatives (we don't eat red meat). The Salmon was perfect! the Sea Bass was excellent, although a little too sweet and the fried crust on the outer part of the fish was a little too thick and rich....Everything was top of the line, very nice! We were invited guests to this meal, otherwise we would never be able to afford such a meal. If you have the money to spend, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best Brazilian steak houses outside of Brazil! The service was very good and the meat was coming round at a very good pace. Dan, the manager, made sure we were happy with everything - all in all, one to try out when you're in the Scottsdale area. Not cheap but well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"We set up a dinner for our employees here during a convention. Service was great. The gentleman taking our order and serving drinks was very nice and attentive despite the restaurant being very full.  You start with a salad bar that is extensive to say the least.  Surprisingly, given the buffet feel, food was very good.  Come hungry as the food is plentiful.  The very nice men that come by with the meat options are great... making sure you get to try everything."}
{"text":"I LOVE FOGO!  My family and I went on Thanksgiving while visiting Vegas. This was the best thanksgiving meal I ever had. I am not a huge red meat fan but their meat was delicious. The salad bar was excellent also. The staff was friendly and always made sure we were well taken car of. I plan to go to the LA location next time I am craving red meat."}
{"text":"Simply put this place is ONE OF A KIND!! The service is impeccable, the food is exceptional and it is consistent from restaurant to restaurant. Kudos to Victor Lou Di Nolfi and Brent  for the great experience !! They made Fathers Day 2015, great!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place. I heard so many great things about this place before I tried it so imagine my disappointment when it was everything I did not hope for :(  It was a Friday night and not at all as busy as I thought it would be. In fact, half of the restaurant was empty. Which is why I could not understand why it took the meat cutter people so long to come around to our table.??? Let's rewind. Months ago I had thee most amazing Brazilian steak house experience at Texas De Brazil!!! I figured they are like sister restaurants right? This should be amazing as well. Boy, was I wrong! I got the ugly red headed step sister version of Brazilian Steak houses this night.   Not much salad bar selection to choose from. Not much meat selection to choose from either. All night we had the same meat, sirloin, come to our table. Like, WHERE'S THE REST OF THE COW? Ribeye? Are you there?! Lol! We literally had to ask 3 different waiters if we could please get some ribeye. 15 minutes later they tell us they had to go make some. Wow. Did I mention this place charges $50/person? Again, I could count how many customers there were in the restaurant. In fact, there was more staff than customers! I kid you not! So why is the struggle real right now?!?! WHY?!   So whatever, our sides are getting cold and we are all getting pretty annoyed so we throw in the towel. Of course we have to order dessert, which by the way, is sold separately. Their Tres Leches cake, DELICIOUS! And that's about it. Great staff, not much selection, meat was okay, dessert was delicious, price was ridiculous for that experience. Would I give them another chance? Nah, I'll just go to Texas De Brazil."}
{"text":"This might have been the best meal of my life.    I got to come here 2 years ago during my first trip to Vegas with my boyfriend.  I tried about 10 types of meats, and was super pleased with each one.  We have visited the Fogo de Chao near us, and it just was not as high quality as this one...we're ruined.  I left here sooo full.  The potatoes and bananas were great...the salad bar was pretty, but who really has time for that when there is men running about with meat to eat?  Make sure you come hungry."}
{"text":"This place is magnificent! My family and I were first timers for my daughters 1st birthday tomorrow and we are very pleased with the service and the food. The steaks are delicious but the chicken (which I normally don't care for) was by far my favorite.   Now on to the important portion of my review... The customer service was AMAZING!! Our waitress was nice, and (I forget what the term is) the mean cutting guys were all pleasant and helpful but Lou the customer service manager was just the best! I read about him on other reviews so out of all the staff helping us I had to ask him his name because I just KNEW he was the Lou everyone was raving about. He waits, serves, takes orders, busses, he does everything!   ALL of the staff was amazing. Especially with our fussy 1 year old. They rinsed her bottle for us and filled it with warm water so we could make another bottle and not to mention waived all the drink fees (just 1 Coke and 1 mojito but still a nice surprise). We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Holy meat in your mouth Bat Man! Where else but a Brazilian style buffet can you have an orchestrated meat orgasm. Brought to you all at the flip of what should never be confused as a drink coaster. With the flip of the red/green\"coaster\" we were immediately assaulted by six meat wielding servers. Everything from fillet, to lamb, to the most incredible chicken wrapped in bacon. Yes my friends bacon! This place is the closest I have come to man vs food.  Not to be forgotten is the salad bar. The salad bar is a vegetarian delight in a carnivores lair. Decidant cheeses, fresh vegetables, pastas, and starchy concoctions to satisfy your inner vegan.  The service was outstanding, even with the $50 a plate cost. I have several meat-a-terian friends I will be sharing Fogo with. After two hours, a salad bar, and fifteen meats later we all left in what felt like the third trimester of a well deserved \"Food Baby\"."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! Friendly faces when you walk in. It's dressy, but you can come casual and no one makes you feel awkward. Fantastic service and the best part is the salad bar is packed with fresh goodness!! Which means you can start eating soon after you get seated.  Once back at your table fresh cheese bread, mashed potatoes and some kind of fried banana (which tastes unbelievably great) is waiting for you! Then the most wonderful thing happens... Chiefs start to bring a variety of Hot sizzling meats and cut you off a slices of heavenly happiness just the way you like it! The GM is always kind to my little ones and make us feel at home each time we come! This is truly a First Class operation."}
{"text":"So i went here with 4 friends from college- we sat at a round table and had a great time.   The service was excellent- the waiter gave us an option between restaurant week or normal selection and explained the difference and walked us through the whole process.   The salad bar has anything you could want- even trendy kale- but dont spend too much time there because you want to save it for the real stuff.   The meat kept rolling in every minute once we had our card flipped green- it was like heaven on earth.   The one complaint I have is that the filet was over cooked and slightly burnt- other than that it was a great time with friends   Id definitely recommend this place. 50 bucks gets you enough food for a week"}
{"text":"My Son and his wife had there 1st Wedding anniversary dinner here last night. I called the restaurant in the morning to see if I could take care of the bill as a surprise. The hostess said I could but would need to go to the website and buy a gift card and phone the gift card number in. It would be applied to their bill. I did this and confirmed my sons name and and reservation time. Apparently when my son got there was a note that he saw that said \"anniversary\" and \"gift card\". Great,  surprise ruined. It gets worse. He wasn't sure why it said \"gift card\" and didn't mention it to his wife or the wait staff.  The bill comes to $130 with no gift card applied ($150 gift card). He pays and walks out. He is wondering about it and calls my wife to ask her about it. She explains what I did. He then goes back and asked the staff what happened to the gift card. They realize the mistake and refund his money and apply the gift card to his bill. I'm definitely not happy about how this was handled. Seems like  a pretty simple process and the staff blew it."}
{"text":"**Summary**        - Fogo is an authentic Brazilian Steakhouse chain. They bring the meats on skewers and cut it right in front of you.        - All the meats were, for the most part, medium to rare. They were super juicy and not too salted.        - My must haves would be the Picanhas, filet mignon (Not the one wrapped in bacon), and the beef ribs.        - Prices - Lunch and dinner have exactly the same menu! You're saving $20 just for eating earlier.        - Doneness - When the server cuts the meat for you, they give you a choice. However, it's usually between rare to medium. Just as a warning or a tip, rare is pretty rare.        - By Request - All the meats rotate regularly with the exception of the Beef ribs and the garlic beef.        - Decor/Mood - Classy and pampering. **Price**        - $26.50 Lunch Mon-Fri 11:30am - 2pm        - $46.50 Dinner Mon-Thurs 5pm-10pm & Weekend **Ordered**        - Salad bar - The smoked salmon is a must. Other than that, it's just salads.        - Costela - Beef ribs. They don't come around unless you ask for them. This is by far my favorite. They ribs have just enough fat in them.        - Filet Mignon - There are two types. The huge steak filet was so tender words can't describe. The bacon wrapped one looked dry so I didn't try it.        - Picanhas - House special and perfectly seasoned.        - Cheese Bread - This place definitely has the cheesiest meltiest in your mouth bread. When they come hot out of the oven, I just want to eat it plain.        - Beef Ancho/Alcatra/Fraldinha - Rib-eye/Top Sirloin/Bottom Sirloin. Cooked perfect and nice and juicy        - Cordeiro - Rack of lamb. Pretty good, but I'd avoid it next time in place of better meats.        - Costela de Porco - Pork Ribs. They were a bit dry and I'd stick to the beef ribs.        - Lombo/Frango/Linguica - Pork Loin/Chicken/Sausage. Didn't really try it.        - Garlic Beef - Didn't get a chance to try it. You have to request it. I found out too late. **Comparing**        - If you've been to the other steak houses in town, here's a comparison section.        - Texas de Brazil - Texas is saltier, the salad bars are about the same. The meats are dryer at Texas.        - Via Brasil - Saltiness is about the same, the salad bar at Via has more hot foods and is more extensive. The meats are juicy, but Fogo has cuts that are more rare than Via.        - Sides - Via Brazil has the most choices and better fried banana. Texas and Fogo have a limited selection. However, Fogo has the best cheese bread.        - For lunch, nothing beats $26.50. It's hands down Fogo.        - For dinner, it depends. If you like your meats rarer, I'd say Fogo. If you like your meats more medium-rare to medium, it's a coin flip. **Recommendations**        - I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a nice treat for a special occasion or in the mood for a ton of perfectly cooked and savory meats."}
{"text":"Fogo always delivers a great product our servers were amazing! This is the real Brazilian food."}
{"text":"Just had Easter lunch there with the family and couldn't be happier with the whole experience.  Complimentary valet and they were extremely friendly.  The host stand was polite quick and efficient.   The entire wait staff couldn't have taken care of us better if they wanted to and of course the food.  From the great choices at the salad bar to the outstanding meat selection especially the filet, ribeye and the house special it couldn't have went any better.  Thank you to everyone who was working Easter to make sure that myself and my family had such a great experience."}
{"text":"As I write this review, I am ready to go into hibernation. Like a bear storing up for winter, I have gorged on a bounty of meats and greens. In Vegas, the weather is not cold enough and there is never a shortage of food, but that did not stop me from mauling every piece of flesh placed in front of me. The worst part is that I did not even try all 15 types of meat and passed on seconds.  On second thought, I would make a very poor bear. Nonetheless, the 12 kinds of protein that I tried were all amazing. I have tried a few other churrascarias around Las Vegas, but none compare to Fogo in value or quality. The salad bar is fresh and bountiful. One round, and plate stacked high, gave me a taste of everything. The hearts of palm and large asparagus spears are a nice touch to add to my salad.   When it came to meat, the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the Picanha were the stand outs. The latter had a nice crust on it that was juicy yet seared to perfection. Even the chicken was the best I have experienced. Normally, at other places, I take a bite and feel underwhelmed. Not here, it is so moist and flavorful. The caramelized bananas were the only plate they needed to replace several times throughout lunch. I might have liked the fried polenta, but had an insatiable spot for the bananas. I cut myself off at two plates.   If that was not enough, dessert is spectacular as well. My friend and I shared a Chocolate Molten Cake and a slice of Key Lime Pie. Both were exquisite. The chocolate bundt cake had a liquid center that oozed down upon breaking. Served with vanilla ice cream gave a nice contrast of hot and cold. All of that made it better with the contrast to the other dessert. The Key Lime had a tartness that was not overbearing and cleanse the palate of the rich chocolate.  Now in retrospect, I should just tell everyone to read Tony T.'s review, because I echoed everything he said in lesser detail."}
{"text":"We had an $80 lunch (2 thankfully we had no drinks) that had highs and lows, Market Bar was fair but one should not fill up on the cheap stuff as the highlight is the meat, started with wimpy skewers of meat small little pieces that they attempted to slice even thinner slices from and you had to be forceful to get more. However that changed and full skewers started coming out and the meat was exceptionally done and very tasty, the lamb was my favorite as was the house steak. Dessert if you had room was awesome for $10 so would I go back yes, about once every 3 years!"}
{"text":"I would have to say Fogo is in 2nd place. They have great service seated us quickly and the minute you turn over you're coasters to green the carvers are Right on it. The rack of lamb is outstanding but they don't serve seafood other than the smoked salmon at the salad bar that I thought could have been cooked longer and the shrimp cocktail wHich is not included in the price for dinner its only alacart. The selections at the salad bar could have been better.  In my opinion Fogo comes in second to Pampas because Pampas serves seafood (bacon wrapped scallops) their salad bar has more selections of hot items and they have this delicious grilled sweet pineapple. Only thing Pampas is missing is the rack of lamb."}
{"text":"One of my top 2 best places I have ever experienced. My girl and I went for our first time last night for my birthday and it was an amazing experience with amazing food choices.  Definitely will be going again!"}
{"text":"On my regular bank walks for work, I was quite surprised to see another Brazilian steakhouse opening downtown. After living in Miami where the Latin foods abound, I kind of get excited to see a little more of it popping up around here.   First was Green Forest Cafe in the far reaches of Penn Hills, and it was the first 'local' spot I tried, and LOVED it. I try to maintain as low carb a diet as I can, but I also LOVE to eat, so a place where the meat just keeps coming is right up my alley.  Then appeared Texas de Brazil. It took me a while to try it, but again, LOVED it. Keep the meat coming. Green means GO!  Well, this past week I had the chance to get out with a friend for a late lunch and we decided to give it a try. We went shortly after 2:30, when I get off work, and were in time for 'lunch'. I hadn't seen my friend since my housewarming four years ago, other than in passing on the street downtown, and we used to ride the bus together when I lived in her area. We were the BEST eye-rolling pals. And for those of you who don't ride public transportation because it's SOOO below you, there's a LOT of eye rolling to do.  We entered the space, and frankly, it's impressive. There is a level of subtle elegance that is missing in most burgh joints. Classy without being utterly pretentious. It's a VERY large and accommodating space. We were greeted by a very pleasant and friendly hostess, who showed us to a table in the middle of the dining room, and our server was promptly at the table to explain things. It's pretty much the same set-up as Green Forest and Texas de Brazil. They have the 'Market Table' (the other places don't give it a fancy name, it's just there), which is kind of like a glorified salad bar, with lovely touches like an antipasta selection of meats and cheeses, lots of fresh veggies and salad makings. There is a side 'hot bar' with beans and rice, soup and bread. I tend to only nibble a bit from that section, because I'm really there for the main event...the meat. And honestly, why fill up on the 'sides' when the meat is coming? That's what I'm paying for.  I did have some of the Market Table (a selection of salamis, prosciutto, some blue cheese and brie) and I had a bowl of the soup of that day, a sweet pea and asparagus soup. THAT was outstanding! I need to find that recipe to make at home. Absolutely delicious.  The staff and the Gauchos were outstanding. Accommodating, incredibly efficient, and on top of everything, and in a very friendly manner. I did have to comment to my friend though that this is about THE 'whitest' Brazilian Steakhouse I've ever been in. I didn't see any Latin looking people in the house. One of our main Gauchos did have a slight accent, and when I asked where he was from it turned out he was from not only Puerto Rico, but we had at one point or another in our lives lived in the little town of Santurce (san-TOUR-say) on the island. But this adorable Puerto Rican guy? Blonde as a Swede!  For the full experience, the lunch price is MUCH lower (around $35). (they can also do just the Market Table, and for an 'additional cost' - usually around $8 - you can 'add' a selection of one meat - which you can have as much of as you like - but only the one). The alcohol is REALLY pricey! I didn't have any, but for two $35 meal deals, one small 'pitcher' (a two serving) of a mango margarita, and two glasses of wine (I just had an iced tea), and the bill came to $122 and some change.  You might be asking at this point, why only three stars? As I mentioned before, I go to a Brazilian steakhouse for the meat...and the one thing I went for, left me totally cold.  The tastiest part of the meat brigade was a sausage. Very flavorful, with a strong edge of what really tasted like fresh sage. I should have asked for a second one. The rest of the meats were totally unimpressive. Chicken just wasn't flavorful, even wrapped in bacon. It was just okay. A little dry. The lamb, just not well seasoned, and not very tasty. The various cuts of beef were okay but nothing came across the tongue as an 'OMG' moment. The absolute worst was the rolls royce of beef cuts, the filet mignon. It was red flavorless mush. The best of them, as our adorable Puerto Rican Gaucho proclaimed as his favorite, WAS the best of them. And I can't remember what it was. It was the best of all of the beef. Just not memorable.  So in ranking our three local Brazilian Steakhouses. Green Forest and Texas de Brazil - SUPERIOR meats. Green Forest can be a little Latin surley on the service, but it's still good. Texas de Brazil and Fogo - superior service. The 'Market Table' (or sides bar), excellent at all three. The prices are really the same ball game at all three. Atmosphere, totally different at all three. Green Forest is in an office complex in Penn Hills, and is kind of an 'older' restaurant. Texas de Brazil is like a theme park ride, with gigantic...well...EVERYTHING. Fogo, classy, good Market Table. Not for the meat."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, very nice atmosphere.  The salad bar was also top notch.   The charruscaria (shish kabob) was amazing (dripping with juices), and kept coming!   Nice variety of meats (although I would have liked to have seen some Shrimp!)   Liked the fact that the portions offered were good sized!  Nice wine list as well.   Definitely recommend, and I would also strongly recommend that you show-up hungry!   With wine and dessert (for 4), I payed just over $400.  So no sense you showing up full and not taking advantage of the non-stop grilled meats offered!"}
{"text":"I have come here many times I and it has always been good. The last time we went at lunch and I was the best trip we have had here. There was not many people in the restaurant and servers were looking for things to do. The food came around faster then it could be eaten and they brought our anything we asked for. The price is also less for the lunch so it is a win win."}
{"text":"I thought TEXAS DI BRAZIL was the best Brazilian Steak house in town.  Till Fogo De Chao came to Vegas setting the bar even higher.  They opened in November 2011 and i cant stop recommending this place to friends and family.    The meats are delicious especially the bacon wrap fillet mignon , amazing bread, salad bar is solid, but the Service is the best part.  I'm all about attention to detail...so when I see a restaurant so determine to make your experience \"the best you ever had.\"  It makes your food taste that much better!"}
{"text":"I've never been to Brazil, but if this restaurant is any indication of what it's like, then I really need to go. First off, I really appreciate that it's not too far off the strip and parking isn't a problem. They have free valet service to make you feel important. Bonus!  Like any other Fogo, the ambience is dim, sexy and welcoming. The salad bar has an excellent choice of vegetables, condiments and one of my personal favorites - smoked salmon. When you come here you better be hungry! It was so delicious that I almost over gorged on the salad bar alone. I can't even say enough about the meats. I think the Picanha(top sirloin) is my favorite. Then the Fraldinha (bottom sirloin), and then the Linguica sausage.  They also serve chicken, pork and lamb options. The Gaucho chefs that prepare the food are actually trained in Brazil. They are also the ones who come out and present the meat to your table. We were talking to the restaurant manager, who by the way is a super-friendly guy that is very passionate about their food, and he mentioned that at this particular restaurant , there are only two chefs that are not Brazilian, but they were sent to Brazil to train.   When the Gaucho chefs come out and slice the meat off the skewer straight onto my plate, I get this primal feeling and my mouth salivates over the slight crisp of the outside meat from the flames and the aroma that come with it. I like to take a second to stare at the tender, succulent pink insides and watch the juices run when I slice into it. There's a hint of sea salt on the outside that add to the crisp flavor. It's so awesome.  If you have never been to a Fogo de Chao, the way the service works is this: The salad bar is of course like a buffet and it is probably the best salad bar I've ever been to. You go up, grab a plate and help yourself to as much as you want. After you sit back down, there are these coasters right next to your silverware that are red on one side and green on the other. When you flip it on the green side, it means \"bring some meat here\".  One by one the Gaucho chefs will come to your table with their particular cut of meat and slice off as much as you want. When you need to take a break just flip the coaster on its red side and they'll stop coming. You'll also have a regular waiter who tends to your drinks and brings you some side dishes like caramelized bananas, mashed potatoes, polenta, bread, and whatever else you might need. They also have an extensive collection of wine that is prominently displayed behind a glass barrier.  The service here is flawless. You can tell the staff really takes pride in what they do. It is an amazing place for any occasion, and in Vegas it doesn't seem to matter if you're in a pair of shorts or in suit. Everyone is treated equally special."}
{"text":"Come with an appetite!  I went for a work event which was real nice. We had the private dining room and the whole 9 yards.  All I can say is if you're not a fan of red meat or have a cholesterol problem don't bother. The ambiance is not as format as I assumed it to be due to the location and hype. Although, the meat and presentation is great. Anything you want sent right to your table and cooked however you would like. Just don't leave your card on the green for too long otherwise you will have more meat than you can handle.  On the other hand, the specialty drinks are good. I don't recall the name of it but they served a traditional Brazilian drink that was wonderful. Not as strong for my liking but good. The salad bar was great too. Everything was fresh and there sure was a lot to choose from. Probably the best I have seen in a while."}
{"text":"Best steak I have eaten in a long time. So many delicious cuts of steak I lost count of what I was eating. Two thumbs way up."}
{"text":"I went there today with friends. It was OK. I cannot say that I was blown away by this restaurant but I can say that it was very expensive for what was offered. We went during lunch time on a Sunday. There was not very much choice in terms of the types of meat that were offered. It was, quite frankly,grossly disappointing. The choices in the area of the buffet were OK. The plantains and cheese bread that came to the table were very yummy. The polenta fries were way too dry. I was underwhelmed and do not plan on going back for a lunch time bill, with tip included, of $40 per person. I have been to much better Fogo de Chao's so this was a sad experience for us. My friends noticed that I barely touched any of the items from the buffet on my plate, as they barely touched theirs. More meat choices would have been a way better outcome. It must have been a slow day but that does not change the fact that it is still the same price and therefore not worth the value paid."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. The whole crew is very friendly and attentive. The meat selections were very tasty and cooked to perfection. The only down fall was the salads. The selections were limited and not worth the walk around. None of the salads were labeled, so you had no idea what you were eating. I'm giving 5 stars for the service and meat, but removing a star for the salad selection."}
{"text":"WTF?? $45.00 CORKAGE FEE  Not a customer friendly start considering the cost to dine here, Which is basically a Meat buffet."}
{"text":"This was just a terrible experience. Made a reservation for a party of 5 at 730 and did not get seated until 915. Classic case of over booking and there were plenty of disgruntled customers there to prove it. No managers to be seen anywhere. Probably hiding out and letting the hostess deal with all the problems. After getting seated no manager came over to apologize for the almost two hour wait. Needless to say I'll never be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Soooooo good!!  The service was phenomenal and the food amazing.  Totally recommend it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"If you are a steak/wine lover, this place is like heaven. I have been to 4 location in different cities but this place never disappoints.  Service is as good as it can be, great selection of wine. Garlic Beef and cheese bread is to die for. One time we had a small issue (server forgot to bring wine) and the manager comped the whole bill for the two of us. I am a die hard fan for life."}
{"text":"Food was so so, beef was ok, chicken was dry, and the pork hard as rock to cut.  Over priced.  Cost about $275 for 3 people and two glasses of wine.   Never paid that much for average food.  Nothing special.  I would never eat there again even if it was free..."}
{"text":"Love it!! I'm picky when it comes to how to my steak is done, but this place made to my standards. The experience was new, yet excellent. The beef was cooked to perfection and I enjoy the side buffet. This was the best place I dined in to celebrate my 29th birthday. Will come back when in vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day, food here was exceptional. They had some good choices at the salad bar and endless Caramelized bananas/ cheese bread. We had the limeade super delicious and their endless cuts of meat cooked to perfection. We'll definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"So on a recent trip to Vegas, my friends and I were trying to decide where to eat.  The cabby mentioned this place, which I have heard of before.  What I have heard is the food is very good.  Needless to say, we chose to eat here.  The place has an upscale look and feel as you enter.  We were greeted immediately and taken to a table.  The place was pretty busy for a Saturday night.  When the waiter came, we all ordered the standard bbq that comes out on large scewers.  After ordering, we went to a large buffet style area that offered tons of sides and compliments to the meat that was soon to come out.  Within a few minutes of getting back to the table, food begins to arrive.  Tons of great steaks and chicken.  All were delicious and they never sowed down on bringing itout until you flipped your card from green to red.  So for dinner and one mixed drink, it was $75 per person (including tip).  Well worth the price for what we got.  If you like the brazillian bbq type of eating or are curious to try it, be sure to come here and give it a try.  A+"}
{"text":"Staff is amazing, food is amazing, atmosphere is amazing....I don't know what else to say. I love this place!  You get what you pay for here and it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"In comparison to Texas De Brazil this place doesn't quite rank.  Salad bar is far better at TDB, you get soup, some seafood selection, more variety of items--at FDC no soup and salad bar just has mostly \"salad\" without the extras.  All the sides at TDB have more flavor, ESP the garlic mash, at FDC it's not garlic, just plain potatoes with a little garnish of cheese and green onion.  Cheese rolls are decent but again better at TDB.  We opted out of the desserts, but those too were not impressive.  Price per person was $48.50 and it seemed their meat servers were not running around as often as those at TDB.  Service was good, but your $$ is better spent at TDB!  Sorry FDC...you just didn't cut it for us!"}
{"text":"Finally...an original steakhouse,..Considering they have been multiplying like gremlins in the past 12 months. The place was packed...I wonder why ? It was a weekday. The food was awesome. No confusion as there is no menu. You just eat what they give you.    In other words it is a prix fixe: $ 42.50 for the dinner and that excludes beverages and desserts. However, the price includes sides (i.e: grilled bananas, mashed poatoes, cheese bread, and grilled polenta) and unlimited servings of their scrumptious grilled meats - there are fifteen to choose from). The dining room is beautiful as is the waitstaff - Many of them are from Brazil which adds to the authenticity of the experience.  The service was im-pec-cable!!!. Everyone was extremely accommodating and acted like they had ownership in the restaurant. They were all extremely polite and well versed in service delivery.  Considering that one steakhouse after another (at least 8), has opened in the valley in the past 12 months, this Brazilian steakhouse concept is the most original.  The salad bar is phenomenal and very varied, so even vegetarians will not get depressed at the sight of the meat skewers visiting their tables.   I have no doubt in my mind that they will be successful. My first impression was extremely positive and I hardly cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been wanting to go to Fogo de Chao forever. I told him that I'd be willing to have a carniverous frenzy on Saturday and he was thrilled. I've been to a Brazilian Steakhouse once before in NYC... at that time in my life I didn't really like meat... that experience turned me around. I knew generally the rules to follow: don't eat TOO much at the salad bar, order a caprihina, and sample a wide variety of meats.   1. The salad bar was awesome! Pretty much everything I got I liked. I filled one plate full (enough for a normal dinner for me) and resisted going back.    2. We ordered caprihina's - the best I've ever had! I was hesitant because I've never really liked them much before, but ordered it for the full \"experience\". It was strong but very good! We also had a glass of Malbec, excellent glass of wine.   3. I'm a picky, picky meat eater, so I didn't like everything I was served, but that's to be expected from me. My favorites were the house cut, the filet, and the top sirloin. YUM!  4. The service was phenomenal... I'm not quite sure how they managed to stay so on top of everything, but they do a great job. Sometimes it was almost a bit much, like when my boyfriend took a spoonful of mashed potatoes from the dish and they whooshed in to replace it. There was still half a dish left! I don't like to be wasteful with my food.   I think the best part of Fogo de Chao is the first visit. It's so fun to sample everything. I'll definitely go back, though it might be awhile since it's such an indulgence."}
{"text":"Apart for paying a set price for as much beef, chicken, pork, lamb and sausage, Fogo sets themselves above the rest with their excellent service. Understand that when you go to Fogo the servers work as a team. They all ensure that even your water glass stays full. They treat you like royalty. With an extensive wine list, cocktails that make you crave more on top of the delicious cuts of meat, you wish you could make this place your home. You cannot take any meat to-go, not that you'd need to, but you can take dessert. You do not want to miss out on this part. Creme brûlée and the flan are the best. This is where I take friends when they come into town. Buffets on the strip, especially for the price, are nothing compared to Fogo. They also set themselves apart from their counterpart, Texas de Brazil. If you go to Texas de Brazil for lunch they cut out the good cuts of meat, not Fogo. It is the same meal for both lunch or dinner. I make this at least a monthly meal for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Authentic and Delicious.  I tried not eating all day in preparation and still could not come close to tasting all the meat.  Salad bar is great, drinks fantastic, and amazing service."}
{"text":"Mmm!  What's not to like about meat, meat, and more meat?!  I can officially cross this place off my \"to do\" list because I had the pleasure of having dinner here while in LV this past weekend.    Everything was delicious!  If I had any complaints it would be that the servers didn't bring around the leg of lamb enough for my tastes, but then again, I was too busy stuffing my pie-whole to simply ask for it.  If you've never been to a brazillian-style bbq, then this place is a must.  Bring your A-game appetite, some friends, and a fat wallet...it's pricey, folks!  However, considering how much meat you're being offered (not to mention the salad bar), I would say it's worth the money."}
{"text":"The salad bar is impressive and the food is top rate.  The atmosphere is bare and leaves little to the imagination.  The pricing is a bit on the high side, but imagine a buffet that comes to you versus the other way around.  The service was OK, but the servers seemed rushed and if you did not speak up fast enough, they were on to the next customer.  Went with a large group and it was fun. Not a place a would go for a romantic dinner and you better be hungry and enjoy meat.  It is what it is and not ashamed of it."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to downtown Pittsburgh's food scene. We went last night with a group of 6 people. Even though they have only been open a short while, the food & service were both excellent! Everything we tried was delicious. The salad/charcuterie bar was amazing (don't forget to try the maple bacon-we almost cleaned them out of that!).  The atmosphere itself is lovely. Spacious and yet warm & inviting at the same time. They have a beautiful wine vault / wall that makes you really thirsty. We all agreed to a return visit in the near future!"}
{"text":"wonderful, but a meat overload good service and very high quality.  the salad bar is almost worth the cost by itself. don't miss the ribs."}
{"text":"Ferrari's + Fashion + Filet = Fogo de Chao   Maybe it's just me, but I felt out of place here. Well, I am getting up there in age and no longer feel a part of the \"in crowd.\" As we parked our car (yes, we parked our own car and didn't use the valet), we saw Ferraris, Mercedes, Escalades, BMWs and they were everywhere. My husband and I drive a Lexus, so we're not exactly chopped liver, but the car display here was over-the-top.   Then, there's the \"eye candy.\" Granted it was \"AZ Restaurant Week,\" so the restaurant was bustling with high energy. There were so many gorgeous young girls in stilettos and spandex dresses that were two sizes too small; I'm not sure how my husband was able to concentrate on his food.   As for the food, it was good. The salad bar is huge with exotic and high end offerings including: tender fresh asparagus stalks, apple salad, hard salami and prosciutto, shaved authentic Parmigiana Reggiano, sun-dried tomatoes, and freshly made buffalo mozzarella.   Here's how the all-you-can-eat carnivorous feast works. After you've had your fill of the salad bar, use your special coaster to let the waiters know you're ready. Flip the coaster to green to signal food service or red to take a break. Each waiter carries dramatic skewers with different meats. There are at least a dozen different varieties of beef, chicken, lamb, sausage, pork. Once we flipped our coasters to green, those waiters swarmed on us like flies to honey. Truth be told, it was overwhelming, almost scary. So we quickly flipped our coasters back to red so we could enjoy our feast. I was surprised that many of the meat selections were dry. Maybe they could set some flavorful dipping sauces on the table to provide moisture and a variety of flavors. But perhaps that would defeat the purpose of showcasing the meat?   At any rate, I can see how many people enjoy Fogo de Chao. But for me, I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Seriously, I do not say this often. Great and unique drinks. If you like meat, get in here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! We went there for dinner before going to New York piano bar! Service was awesome and the food was so good!! If you haven't been there,  you have to go!!"}
{"text":"Incredible as always! The salad bar is great, but who comes here for salad... unless you come with your girlfriend who is a vegetarian like myself. You have to pick and choose your meats because they aren't all incredible, but a lot are. If you are on their birthday list, you get $25 off of your meal and a free dessert. Also, if you would like filet mignon, put a request into your waiter and he can help request it to come out for you!"}
{"text":"Loved the Saturday evening staff at the Summerlin Location (8/5/2017) ! From the server to the receptionist, excellent customer service. It's a bonus to the already exceptionally sumptuous dinner. Filet mignon, lamb, apple salad, chocolate mousse cake are to die-for!"}
{"text":"My husband and met up with some friends, we were celebrating our friend birthday and our 22 nd anniversary on a Saturday night at 6:30pm. The restaurant was very elegant and quiet, which is unusual if you been to this type of restaurant before. The restaurant was able 25 % full. We sat down ordered some shrimp and a bottle of wine. Our waitress was very attentive to us and the gentlemen bringing around the different meat was as well. The salad bar and meat itself tonight was just ok, nothing great. Unfortunately I can't give a good compliment about the lady that was working the bar. It was 25 minutes to get one drink from her and did I mention the restaurant was not busy. The waitress made her deliver our drink in person and she half way apologize. We ordered another drink again 25 minutes, notice I said drink and not drinks, most of us were drinking wine. Again she personally delivered the drink to us and half way apologize, but this time she was sarcastic. Our whole table was shocked! Our bill was over $500 you would think you would receive better service. This will be my 1st time at this location and the last time at this location."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception there and was perfect, the food  and the service are excellent . They even received during the day our wedding cake."}
{"text":"Just got home from Fogo, totally stuffed! Monica, our server was wonderful, attentive without being intrusive and presented us with a complimentary dessert for our anniversary! The food was fantastic, 10 times better than pampas. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A fabulous meat escapade with service that didn't miss a beat!  I honestly couldn't tell you what choice of meat was the best because all of my selections were mouthwatering.   The market table is great too. There were many vegetable choices, salads and meats /cheeses that paired well with the meat. You must try the squash and coconut soup before the meal.  When I thought I had enough, I couldn't say no to the papaya cream. I'm not going to describe the taste and texture of this dessert, so you'll just have to try it for yourself.  The ultimate part of my experience was the service. We didn't have one waiter, we had the entire staff waiting on us...what a concept!!! I didn't even hesitate to tip over 20% because they deserved it!!!!! We even got a complimentary gift card (a Valentine's Day special).   I'm a fan of Fogo!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! That's the word to describe this experience, really classy. Remember that in life money is secondary and the experience and quality of food & service is what people want, they're in a city that's filled with money so why would money be priority. The good people that live and visit this beautiful city want ambience, servers and hosts that are kind and beautiful, they want to be in a happy comfortable enjoyable setting. This is the place, please stop by and make it a point when your in town. Good luck and God bless!"}
{"text":"Needing a break from the Strip, and having a deal through Yelp's Spring Break 2012, my wife & I had dinner here one night.  I made our reservation online and mentioned that it was our 5th wedding anniversary.  Their website was very easy to use, and I was able to make a reservation the morning of.  There is an ample parking lot, with complimentary valet.  Once inside, we were seated promptly.  Our reservation was for 6:30; the place was pretty full, but not completely packed yet.    After giving our drink orders, my wife & I hit the salad bar.  The first thing I noticed was the basket of bacon.  I really had to remind myself that bacon was only the appetizer, not the main course.  So I only put a few strips on my plate, along with some prosciutto, salami and mozzarella.  My wife took some olives, artichoke hearts and one of the salads (along with said bacon).  Once we sat down, we turned our signs to \"Go,\" and the flow of meat began.  While we tried a little of everything, my favorites were:  1. The Pichaha (the signature u-shaped cut) 2. The lamb chops 3. The linguica (sausage).  The staff were very friendly, checking on us often if we needed any more food or drinks.  But my favorite staff was the gentleman who was manning the alcohol cart.  We offered us any and all types of drinks, which almost made me cry again (after seeing the bacon basket).  Lastly, after we were finished with dinner, our server offered us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.  We chose the creme brulee, which came with the words \"Happy Anniversary\" written on the plate with chocolate and caramel.  I thought that was a very kind gesture, which made our evening.  This was our favorite meal during our most recent time in Vegas.  I know we will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"It had been several years since we went here. We were craving the salad bar.  Once our waiter learned we were just having the salad bar, we never saw him again. We hardly saw any servers after we ordered. Guess they figured the tip would be small.  The salad bar choices have changed over the years with less choices & not as good of quality. The price was $25 a piece. Too high for what we got. We were ignored & had poor service. We couldn't wait to leave & won't be going back."}
{"text":"Everyone I know recommended this restaurant for my birthday. First time there so I made reservations and I did let them know it was for a birthday.  I have to say the food was excellent but the service was very subpar. Ran out of water several times, had a waiter ask if this was our first time there, I explained yes and that he would return and explain everything and never did, but the worst part was my girlfriend was using crutches, we were ending our night, I went to the restroom and not one employee offered to open the door for her.  For the money charged for this restaurant, I do expect a gold star experience."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  The chimichurri sauce was flavorful.  My top picks for the night were Cordeiro - fresh young leg of lamb sliced off the bone and Costelo de Porco - tender pork ribs slow-roasted to perfection. (Mmm!)  Dessert for the night was crème brûlée- and it was oh so good!    Ambiance definitely sets the mood!  Love the place!  Great for a couple's date night or a group dinner date.    Service was good.  Our server was very diligent and was always checking in.  Some of the meat servers, I felt, were a bit in a rush which concerned me as they carry a big knife along with them.   Overall, my experience at Fogo was superb!"}
{"text":"Why do I keep coming here? I never pass up an opportunity to eat at Fogo and it's usually dinner I eat here a couple times a month so I know the ins and outs of this place.  Today happens to be a lunch at Fogo day and as with other lunch times I've had here the service/food sucks. I swear it's annoying because they try to \"hide\" the tastiest (and prob most expensive) cuts like the beef ribs and the filet mignon. Like today, I asked for the beef ribs and not only did it take them 30 minutes to bring them, but they tasted like they were reheated hastily. The server didn't seem like he wanted to give me any of the good stuff, just the burnt inedible parts. Fail. I know my stuff here and asked another server to bring them back and he gave me better stuff, but that's beyond the point which is if you don't want people to get certain cuts, then just don't offer them! Part of the filet they gave me was burnt and inedible, the other part was good, but not the best. The atmosphere during lunch feels much different than during dinner, perhaps it's because dinner is busier, or perhaps because they've got fresh cuts at night and during lunch you get the left over crap. In any case, I'm going to stop referring this place altogether if they don't get their shit straight. Excuse my French but this gets annoying when you hype up the place to friends, then you take them and the experience sucks."}
{"text":"It's an all-you-can-eat restaurant, but it is DELICIOUS. The salad bar has plenty of fresh, tasty greens as well as other side items, such as smoked salmon, prosciutto, steamed potatoes, beans, rice, etc. However, what really makes this place shine is the assortment of tasty meats their staff brings to your table (if you turn your coaster over to the green side). There are just too many of them to name individually, but one item in particular was the bacon-wrapped turkey. Just... out of this world, hands down. The only real drawback is the price per person of $51.50 (to be fair, it IS an upscale restaurant on Flamingo/Paradise), but it's not too bad if you are fairly well-off or you only go out to eat once or twice a month. It is guaranteed that I will be returning here on one of my next dinner dates."}
{"text":"Oh Yelpers! I don't think so.  I was very disappointed. First, there is an online offer to save about $19 per person which sounds amazing. Turns out that is for a very restricted menu.  If you like unlimited salad bar and lots of different cuts of sirloin, you'll be happy. But not at $50 per!  The rib eye was ok. The filet was very dry. Everything is bathed in salt.  Want shrimp? That's extra. Want sea bass? Extra.  The place was packed. It was clean. The service was friendly and no one was rushing anyone.  Not the place to come for the best cuts of beef. Sirloin, sirloin, sirloin everywhere. The other cuts came around infrequently.  The pork rib was dry and flavorless. The pork sausage was sickening.  The chicken wing was dry and overcooked. I did not try the lamb or the beef rib."}
{"text":"Such a fun place! Make sure you come hungry because it's more food then anyone can handle. Some of the meat was a little dry but the service was incredible!"}
{"text":"So went back this time for my brothers bday dinner! We were a large group of 22 and I have to say I was happy that the restaurant was able to accommodate us! I am a vegetarian so I was drawn to the salad bar/ I say 35$ it's not worth it! I wasn't blow away/the choices were very very minimal I have to say that if we are paying that much I think that they would have a better array especially fruits. My family was pleased with the meat selection but they said that they didn't get a lot of great choices till the end when they were completely full up. Drinks are expensive! The thing is would I go back- it's a 50/50 unless they improve on selection!  Ambiance was great!!"}
{"text":"Our server was amazing, I think we could of been his only table (which some servers screw up not wanting to crowd but just end up not being around.)    The gauchos werent very friendly, but I guess theyre not supposed to be personable.   I was disappointed in the salad bar, not much there, everything is cold.  When your card is green and you just sit down its a bit overwelming... then it dies off and youre looking around, asking for specific things, I never did see the filet minion again.  Mashed potatoes were so boring. Bananas were good, but nothing special. Out of all the meats my favorite was the parm crusted pork (usually dont care for pork and am a huge steak eater) the steaks just didnt have any flavor. Some were really salty. Some things were dried out.   Overall, fun idea, fun with friends, great if your husband can eat a lot, get your moneys worth. But for me, it wasnt worth that amount for that quality. Id pay $50 for an amazing 5oz filet over this any day."}
{"text":"Minh is great with our service today. He explained everything to us and even shared with us the party venues. And you can tell that he works really hard and very diligent in working all his tables."}
{"text":"Ok. We went to fogo de chao cause it was something different and had amazing reviews. Sometimes yelp is wrong. The meats are hit or miss. One stick of filet is moist another is dry. The sides were very dull and uninspired. I can't really eat $51.50 worth of dinner anymore but the service and ambiance were lovely."}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao, Scottsdale, Az is a chain restaurant which has first class meats, chefs, gauchos (servers who cut the meat to order at your table), ambiance. You will enjoy everything except the check.  My favorite is the beef rib and the picanya.  Would recommend for those meat eaters with deep pockets."}
{"text":"Delicious! Excellent service! Beautiful restaurant! Yes, it is an expensive treat, but the meats were delicious, wide variety, highest quality....will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The food was amazing, but the best part was the experience and atmosphere. The servers and manager were so friendly and attentive. You have to be a meat eater though."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday dinner with my wife.  Very nice décor and my wife loved the salad bar.  It was a neat experience with all the chefs coming by the table with different cuts of meat.  The service was great especially one helpful and friendly waiter from Guam.  Hope to visit again..."}
{"text":"This is an amazing steakhouse. The experience was unforgettable. The service was outstanding. The food beyond perfect. Drinks were so delicious. I had the white sangria. I'm not a wine drinker and I couldn't get enough. Again absolutely delicious. I can not wait for my next experience at Fogo de Chao. If you have not been here yet. You are missing out."}
{"text":"This place always amazes, salad bar offers fresh unique and tasty choices. The meats are definitely the star here, all of them are tasty and perfectly cooked. If you want rare, you can get dark red and bloody, if you like well done it's just a slice away. Deserts are perfectly acceptable and usually compliment your dinner perfectly. The only downside is, soda is served in 10az cans that come to 2.50ish each. I racked up just about $10.00 worth of diet coke, but I didn't come for the coke and the meat was so tasty that it really didn't bother me, maybe it should have. This is a great place to go for those celebration type outings, guys will probaby appreciate it more than the ladies, who probably won't eat their monies worth. Bottom line: if you haven't been, you have to try it at least once, and probably twice, and maaaybe three times if your pockets go that deep."}
{"text":"I feel like Jim Carrey's character from the movie \"Yes Man\" whenever I am at a churrascaria...totally incapable of saying no to anything!     Caipirinhas? Yes, and please keep them coming.   Bottom sirloin?  Heck yes!  I'll take 3 slices.   Lamb chops?  OH FUCK YES!!  Leave the whole freakin thing on the table!!!    No....control.....whatsoever.  If a shady looking dude wearing a hat and a musty  overcoat offered candy corn straight from the palm of his slightly dirty hand, I would say yes and assume it was a limited time promotion.    Fogo de Chao vs Texas de Brazil:  It's a high scoring draw. Sure, there a few items the other one doesn't have, and certain meats may be slightly better at one over the other, but everyone ends up a winner in this fight no matter which you choose."}
{"text":"I had heard about Fogo de Chao before but never had an opportunity to visit this restaurant before. While visiting Las Vegas last week I was running low on cash and decided to find my closest bank on my phone's GPS. While driving to the bank my girlfriend spotted Fogo by pure accident. Since our plan was to go to the bank then decide of a place to have lunch, and since I wasn't going to spend on gambling I figured we'd have lunch at Fogo.  This is by far the flashiest, most upscale restaurant I've been to. The atmosphere was very calm and pleasant that afternoon. Unlike many restaurants that assign one waiter/waitress to a section of the restaurant, Fogo has its staff attending all tables. Their buffet has plenty to select from and they keep the famous Brasilian bread pao do queijo (cheese bread) coming. They have special waiters dressed in gaucho (southern brasil cowboy) outfits walking by the tables with different kinds of meat cuts on long metal skewers serving you at your table. I believe they say they serve 12 or 14 different types of meats. The fillet Mignon was unbelievable.  The restaurants presentation is very nice and clean. Lights were a bit dim which made the atmosphere perfect for a lunch date with my girlfriend; although, I can only imagine dinner would be a lot more busy, active and loud for a romantic atmosphere. Towards the end of our lunch several parties had come in for lunch and it wasn't as quiet as when we had walked in.  For those in my friends list or the L.A. area, there is a Fogo de Chao in Beverly Hills. If my mind serves me right, lunch for two came out to like around $35-$40 per person. Dinner hours tend to be more expensive so expect to drop a pretty penny. Overall, this is an experience I'd recommend but it isn't cheap. We should treat ourselves to something nice from time to time, splurge, and a meal at this restaurant is a nice way to do that."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. I've been to similar restaurants and had much better experiences. Our initial server never took our drink order, never offered us bread, and didn't ask if we'd like extras. Luckily the table next to us had someone attentive initially help them.. she saw us sitting there and took our drink orders and offered bread (you share servers). Honestly, the servers were the only part of the evening enjoyable. Very attentive. The chairs are too tall for the tables (mind you I'm 5'4\") making the seating uncomfortable. Some of the tables aren't located in the best spots, so by the time the passadores arrive to our table, most of what's left on the skewer is extremely bloody meat. I'm a fan of medium rare, but I'd prefer to not have a bloody lump of meat on my plate. I could've brought the meat home and threw it on the grill and it would've been better. Very disappointing. The buffet was scarce as well. I just don't feel that this particular restaurant lives up to the true style of Churrascaria that I'm familiar with. My husband and I left feeling unsatisfied and sad that we spent so much money. We won't be returning-as the area has so many amazing places to eat wonderful food and this restaurant in my opinion isn't one of them."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! They have an excellent salad bar with all sorts of delicious salads and sides the meats are to die for my personal favorite is the filet minion! & I have to say I have had good service many times! But I received incomparably amazing service from our amazing waiter Derek! He was charming, funny, and super attentive he kept everything coming! \"Chiles Toreados\"are a must!!! Derek is definitely and all star and although it was only my 2nd time here I will be back and will make sure and ask for Derek!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place on the Joe Rogan Podcast so I decided to stop by and eat there.  As a meat lover and a lover of food, this place has to be my favorite restaurant.  The meat was well seasoned and very flavorful.  The customer service was excellent as well.  As soon as I flipped the tag over for food, it was like they all came rushing at me with bbq'd meat on skewers.  I was treated like a king and ate like a hungry peasant.  gyeah."}
{"text":"So let's just start with the service it was top notch! I wish my wife had been with us but she had to fly back home on Monday. Our server explained everything to us Ricardo came over to check on us and no shortage of food! The salad bar alone is to die for everything fresh and many choices! You could make a meal out of the salad bar alone! We were always asked which meat we wanted and how we wanted it! Our server from the prime rib loft should take a lesson from these folks on customer service! If it comes down to saving 15.00 bucks on a meal or coming hear I say Fogo all the way! The chocolate lava cake was fantastic! 2hr dinner with friends with a great atmosphere we were treated like house guests just amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow what a spread.  At $52 a head for dinner, it is a bit pricey, but the meal and service were fantastic.  I feel like I would be leaving a 5 star review if the price for dinner was priced at $40 or less.  My wife (vegetarian) was able to enjoy just the salad bar but at $27, also a bit pricey.  The food was exceptional.  My favorite cuts they brought to the table were the Ribeye, New York Strip and the bacon wrapped Fillet.  The servers were very accommodating, asking what I would like served if I passed on options like sausages or chicken.  The Salad Bar was also awesome, several items to choose from.  The Mashed Potatoes, Fried Polenta and cooked bananas side dishes were also all welcomed, just ask your server if you'd like more of anything as they are also included with your meal.    I'd be interested in trying Fogo for lunch if the price is more affordable than dinner time."}
{"text":"A quick FYI: This coming week for Restaurant Week they will be offering dinner for $40 per person...a great deal!  I love LOVE this place! I love the wide selection of their Salad Bar and Meats. I also LOVE their desserts!"}
{"text":"Go very hungry. There is a ton of food. The carvers can be a little snippy when you don't know what you're doing would be my only complaint. Overall great food, the desserts were really excellent."}
{"text":"Finally, a churrascaria in Las Vegas that is actually good.  It's about time.  I have been to every one in the area, except Yolie, and have hated all of them.  Except this one.    The meat is actually cooked right, is flavorful, seasoned correctly, and tender.  The salad bar is fresh and solid, not so overwhelming like that other chain at Town Square.  The service was attentive without being really annoying, which I've complained before at other Brazilian steakhouses.  Drinks were refilled instantly, fresh plates were offered as needed, chairs were pulled out, and everyone was so friendly and helpful.  My husband made a special request for meat that wasn't out on the floor, and they went back and cooked it fresh just for him.    My only real big complaint was the price - very expensive at $45.00 a person, but when the manager thanked us for coming on opening night and gave us both certificates to not only come again for free, but to bring two more people, I thought that was pretty cool.  Really happy with Fogo - the only churrascaria I'll go to in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here all the time! We love it and we always make sure to have an empty stomach before we go. The wait staff work together so anytime you need anything there is always someone to help!   If you love meat then this is definitely somewhere you have to go!"}
{"text":"Service was attentive, we got seated right away without a reservation. Flip your card to green and the 'meat men' all flock to your side. The salad bar was good- I loved that they have a huge bowl of crispy bacon :)  I eat my meat well done. So... If your like me, this place probably isn't for you. They cook most of the meat medium-rare. Though on the shank they do have medium-well (sometimes). I just had to special order mine and I didn't really get the experience of them cutting it off the shank or anything.   Probably wouldn't go again for the reason stated above. HOWEVER, the rest of my party absolutely loved it and didn't want to leave."}
{"text":"Skip the meat! We stopped in for my friend's 50th birthday and although she had a good time, I was underwhelmed for the hefty price of $174 for three people with no drinks except a few cokes. My advice to you if you read this review: take the other negative reviews to heart.  While the host and our server were nice, the meat servers were rude. The market bar/salad bar was quite good, but I was really disappointed by the meat - the main seasoning was salt and there was way too much of it.  To sum: bottom sirloin - or was it top? Anyway, this was the best meat by far...tender and flavorful  ribeye - too salty with a hefty salt crust, otherwise fine  lamb chops - pretty good, but I didn't like the spice mix used  filet wrapped in bacon - salt from the bacon overwhelmed any flavor  pork rib - horrible, the worst - gamey and possibly undercooked - I left it  I was bummed and a little hungry.  I was also miffed that they didn't offer us a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl -- lame!  Also, shortly after our meal, all of three of us had stomach issues and spent some time in the bathroom - my guess - the lamb? or the pork? Bleh. I would come back for the salad bar and skip the meat."}
{"text":"All you can eat great quality food. Make reservations online or you will wait forever. Really crowded. Some of the meats were a bit seasoned and overcooked. Try the cheese bread they bring, so yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Just Wow!!!!  I was simply blown away.  The restaurant was beautiful on the inside.  I had a difficult time getting reservations for our company during CES week.  We were limited to 10 seats and at 5pm only so I took it not knowing what to expect.  The salad bar was absolutely amazing!  (I took several photos)  We were the first patrons to disturb the beautiful display of food which felt a little guilty.  It is the ultimate display and presentation.  Then the hot rolls came next that were so yummy.  They brought out plantains that were prepared perfectly.  I was literally in awe with every bite.  I fell victim to over indulging on the salad bar as the meat courses came around.  The meat was prepared perfectly.  There was so many choices that i couldn't choose.  I told my co-worker that before I'm about to die to take"}
{"text":"Although it's pricey, it's totally worth it if you go at lunch. You can sample all the meats which a delicious and wonderfully seasoned. There isn't one meat that isn't tastier than the next. The trick is to just order meats that you like, make minimal trips to the salad bar. I had 4 filet mignons and snacked on meats and cheeses from the salad bar while waiting for more meat to arrive. Also, only order water. Drinking sodas or wines adds to your bill very quickly. The sides that they give you are delicious too. You have to master the art of eating all you want but not getting stuffed to the gills so you can walk out of there feeling full and not sick. It's totally worth a try. Everyone should experience this restaurant at least once in their life."}
{"text":"My first time here I've heard a lot about! Definitely going back!!! My girlfriend and I went for lunch and the salad bar was excellent my favorite was the potato salad and Caesar salad amongst the large variety of other things....then you get to the meat thing and they were not lying when they said the meat doesn't stop coming until you flip it over to red!!! Lunch time was decently priced as well!!!"}
{"text":"Meget bra mat.  Hær får du servert MYE kjøtt. Og det er godt kjøtt. Artig konsept med og la en grønn brikke ligge framme så kommer d kjøtt hele tiden. Kan bli litt for mye av det gode  Er du ut etter masse god mat er dette plassen. Vil du ha litt mere fancy porsoner. Så må du finne en annen plass"}
{"text":"Another steakhouse has opened in the downtown area. Like we need more with at least 3 others down here already? However, since it is Brazilian inspired I decided to check it out.  I had a reservation made with open table and when I arrived at my scheduled time which was when they opened, I was told I had to wait 15 minutes because they weren't done setting up. The place had just opened for business and no one was there!  Have researched the business on the web I learned that the offer free parking in the Oliver Garage after 4 on weekdays and $10.00 parking in that same garage at lunch with validation. My visit was on a Sat and on Sats and Suns they serve brunch. The brunch includes their famous \"market table\" which to me seemed like a glorified salad bar with specialty items and behind it was a hot items which consisted of your usual breakfast fare (sausages,bacon, etc,) along with Brazilian made hot items to compliment it.  During brunch you cannot order Brazilian cuts or select cuts but if you want those meats then you would need to order the full churrasco experience. Your server would hand you a two sided card (green and red) that includes an opportunity to scratch off a code to enter online to win a trip to Brazil. Basically what happens is that servers will come to your table with long skewers of meat as long as you have the green side up and they will carve off the portion you select. Once you turn it over to red then they will stop coming to my table.  I finally had a nice waitress seat me and a wonderful lady named Rebecca wait on me. She was very attentive to my needs and appreciated all the help she gave me. I had noticed on the menu that they offer mango chilean sea bass as another option during brunch. I could have it ala carte or with the market table. Learning that the fish already comes with asparagus, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas with a Brazilian style lady lock, I figured that would be plenty for me.  She asked if I wanted to start with jumbo shrimp cocktail as an appetizer which I declined. That appetizer is way over $20.00 and is not listed on the menu. The restaurant has a full bar and a notable wine list which I also declined.  People have asked me \"why would I order fish in a Brazilian steakhouse?\" Simple, when you come as a group not everyone wants steak and I wanted to see for myself how their how their Brazilian style fish was.  All the tables are numbers which are for the server's convenience. Although this place appears elegant I did see a few people wearing T-shirts and jeans.  I was told I had to wait 15 minutes for my food but in the meantime she started me out with Brazilian cheese filled rolls. They are gluten free and did not come with any butter. I found them bland and wasn't impressed with them.  When I finally got my meal I found the fish moist, tender, and there were no bones. It was indeed an excellent choice. The asparagus which it sat on was cold so they promptly brought me out a replacement which was much better. The whipped potatoes came with a spoon and like she had told me,  the caramelized bananas were like a dessert unto themselves. They were very good and you can get refills if you want more. The lady lock was fair but I was really impressed with the fish and the other sides.  When I was finished she did give me a dessert menu. Desserts normally run close to $10.00 each. Rebecca recommended that I try the papaya and vanilla ice cream and they come and pour a liqueur over it since it was light. I went for it and a server poured the amount I desired over it. It is indeed light and had that melted taste to it, however, it was very good and not overly filling as I had hoped.   This place is very pricey and believe me you do get tons of meat with the churrasco experience. The market table extends on a long oval shaped ice bed with a vast selection of soups, vegetables, cheeses, charcuterie board, and some seafood to compliment your meal.   To me this place is a work in progress since they have recently opened. The decor is beautiful and very laid back. Families are welcome to eat here. Special pricing is given for children under 12.  Located in the building that once housed Saks it is conveniently located near pubic transportation. WiFi is available and they will graciously input the passcode into your mobile device."}
{"text":"Excellent experience all around!! The meat selection is very good...hot, fresh and plentiful. I must say the best part is the friendly, knowledgeable staff! They take amazing care of the guests.  Keep up the awesome job!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Fogo de Chao a month ago with Other Yelpers (CMYE by Misti).   I always wanted to come back and dine here again...  As promised, returned to Fogo de Chao to have a New Year's Eve Dinner with friends.   When we walked in, we were greeted by three hostesses, and I thought it would be a busy night.  I really liked the nice open dining area which is something I always noticed when I walked into the restaurant.  The moment our seated, the waitstaff brought us a small basket of warm puffy biscuit that tasted like cheddar cheese, yumm! We all wanted to drink a good red wine and the waiter recommended several easy & smooth taste of wine that we should try out for the evening.  We decided to try a bottle of \"La Creama Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast\". It was absolutely delicious-great balance & full of fruit :).  After ordering our wine, we all started with going to the unlimited salad bar to start with something light.  The salad bar here is actually simple and decent-a various kinds of cheese, vegetable, and salads.  Well, I really appreciate the fact that they kept it simple.  Anyways, I am here at the restaurant to have all different section of meats! I have tried everything except the Lamb and Chicken Heart.  I really enjoyed having a Pork Sausage, Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin, Flank Steak, Prime Rib, and Garlic Sirloin.  The skewer of meat kept coming to our table.  I don't remember how many times I turned my \"Green Dial (which means KEEP THE ENDLESS MEAT COMING, PLZ)\" on the table. We finished our meal with sharing a plate of dessert, FLAN!  Oh my goodness, the texture of the pudding custard was something different than what I usually had it before.  I was very fond of the FLAN :) :)  It's a great place to have a nice meal for a special occasion and I would suggest going for lunch since it's less expensive.   But, definitely worth the splurge...  I'm sure I'll be back. And it is good to have some cash in your purse because I was asked to valet on both trips to the restaurant.   Don't forget to finish off your meal with a mouth-watering dessert, Flan :-9   FLAN  People........, F L A N !!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated our 21st Anniversary with a wonderful dining experience.  We've experienced Brazilian food before but this place was much nicer than the previous place.  Our waiter explained everything in detail regarding the market selections and the sides that would be brought out.  The gauchos were on point and made several rotations.  When we mentioned a particular likening to the Hawaiian Pork they immediately brought out a fresh skewer.  They happened to be running a summer special so we got desserts for free!!! Absolutely delicious. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I treated the my hubby for a nice dinner and he chose to come here. I love how they have different types of meat selection and a full salad bar. Yes, of course this is an all you can eat place and you better love meat if you come here. We both left with very full tummys but unfortunately we are not big eaters. I just got full from the salad bar and cheese selections. All in all he dinner was nice. This is my hubby's go to place... So I was happy that he was happy."}
{"text":"More like Fogo de \" Holy Cow!\" Guys running around with long metal rods wrapped in meats??? Hell yes! Is this some type of meat-lover's porno shoot I happily stumbled upon?  I can't really add anything that hasn't already been said, so I will just say that you MUST go here if you consider yourself a meat-lover like me.  My personal favorites: Everything wrapped in bacon, and the Parmesan crusted...YUMMMMM!   \"WOW, that's a lot of meat!\""}
{"text":"Fogo de Chao is a Brazilian Steakhouse, where they serve all kinds of roasted protein (chicken, all types of steak, sausage, etc) tableside with somewhat kebab style skewers. You flip a coaster from red to green indicating when to be served and green to red indicating when to stop being served. You can flip back and forth as much as you like.   We came with a group 8+ deep, without reservation on a Friday, and they were more than accommodating - although the hostess jokingly flashed me the mean face when I told her how many people we had coming. The atmosphere is spacious and warm, seemingly upscale but not so smuggy you couldn't come in sweatpants with your family.   We got a couple drinks while waiting, such as the Caipirinha (my first time having one) which was delicious and the peach Bellini which was tasty but thick. Ran about $13/drink, where beer was about $7-$8 each.  They serve fried polenta sticks and some type of bread, both OK, as appetizers. There are plenty of options at the help-yourself food bar, including smoked salmon, greens, and meat/cheeses. The trick is to pick sparingly here and save room for the onslaught of skewered protein.  By far the best meats were the ribeye, sirloin, and mignon. The bacon-wrapped chicken was dry, the lamb was amazing however it was encrusted with black peppercorn to the point it became overpowering. Make sure to watch the cut of the meat when they ask what seer you want, because there were a couple times the beef was what I would consider medium-rare to rare when I was asking for \"medium\". I prefer my meat on the well-done side and I'm not the carnivore kind of guy you might see on Masterchef.  Overall, the Fogo - much less the Brazilian steakhouse - experience is a must try. Caution: Be prepared to drop some serious cash! Given it's Scottsdale where you may end up parking next to a Ferrari, our check was $173 including gratuity and not counting tip or our earlier drinks/beer for two people. The last time I spent that much at a \"steakhouse\" it was because of strippers. No strippers at Fogo..."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE!  It's an orgy of meat and the salad bar has things on it I've never seen on a salad bar before.  Come hungry and wear lose clothes...you WON'T be disappointed!  Beautiful restaurant and the staff is very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"What a disappointment went here for the first time because of there special SUMMER FEAST ya right. I have been to Texas de Brazil multiple times thought we would give Fogo a try since they had this special going on and closer to the house what a disappointment. They don't tell you the Sumer feast doesn't include the most popular items like FILET, RIB EYE, and some other meats. The whole reason you go is for these cuts at least I do. I was furious. If they had explained this in there website witch I looked at before going not a problem or there lovely sign out front it would not have been a issue I hate fake advertising my pet peeve. I guess I am heading to Texas de Brazil love that place."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE! celebrate my birthday & from the start it was amazing! Jose made sure we were well taken care of, knowledgable on wines & the staff went above and beyond to see us happy! We wWill come back here every time we are in town! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Thank you to Jose for such a wonderful birthday evening, we haven't had such excellent service in a long time! Oh and food was Delish too! ;)"}
{"text":"I don't know if there are many people that can consider themselves legitimate experts when it comes to meat, but I'd say I'm about as close to expert as I am fanatical. I smoke meat frequently, I eat at Brazilian steakhouses as often I my health can afford, and exercise frequently to justify the habit.  I think I can say with some authority that the meat here is well worth your time. They have a huge selection and you rarely have time to work on your salad options between a new skewer of meat being presented. The good news is that if meat is the reason you're here, this is exactly what you want. If that isn't the reason, you might want to choose another option.  That being said, the desserts were fine but nothing impressive. The salad bar was also okay. I wasn't really there for those things, so it didn't bother me. Only improvement I would have looked for would have been roasted pineapple like I've seen and enjoyed at similar Brazilian steakhouses. It was certainly worth the money, though!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! This restaurants customer service is second to none! The food is very good quality and very well presented and served! I will definitely be coming back definitely a must if you're in town!"}
{"text":"The salad bar..... Who needs the meat!! Unless it's the garlic beef. Or the cheesy bread knots. Now, I usually dont visit chain restaurants... especially after coming to this place from the San Diego location. I thought the food was just to DIE for, so I decided to take my friend who was visiting here (especially since I had a two people eat foooo FREE coupon). Now, I must say... I like this restaurant over the San Diego location. The tables are spaced out, and are definitely more accessible, you arent side-stepping between customers/servers trying to venture to the salad  bar or to your own table.  They have a drink service constantly going around? Something I'm definitely not used to. That was so incredibly convenient. The service was superb and the servers very friendly.  I would come here just for the garlic knots.  I seriously want to sneak in with ziplocs next time just to load up before I leave.... totally kidding. kinda. (IM FROM THE BAY AREA, we get ratchet).  Anyways A++++++."}
{"text":"Had a good experience here wanna keep it cut and dry...the service was very good.  Cute how they always pull out the chairs for women.  I don't know if they do this all the time but it was pretty dead when we came in so I'm assuming when it's packed it's not as prevalent. The food was good....the market table was good, but you can tell some of it has been sitting for a minute probably bc it was dead (literally my party and one other party that was wrapping up...halfway through a party of five came in) so it wasn't as fresh as I wish it was.  The steak was good.  Had an instance where the ribeye came out raw in the middle...not medium rare or rare...raw and somewhat cold.  But everything else was good.  Most of the meat was cooked well and juicy...so juicy that when the waiter came around to cut the meat it literally squirted meat juice on my dress (luckily it was black) another down side was the waiter that we sat down with was at the end of his shift and kept forgetting my boyfriends beer, he even asked us about it and followed through but never came back then suddenly we had a new waiter who was nice as well.  So the beer never came (oh well). They were super apologetic and apologized profusely, so it was forgiven. But bc they were very attentive and the manager was very kind we looked passed it and pretty much the majority of our experience was good.  Most likely we'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is good, but including low-end wine and dessert it's going to cost you about $85.00 per person all in. In my view it's just not worth that. The restaurant is more about it's gaucho theme than anything else. And it uses a marketing technique to get you to over-indulge at the salad bar and/or fill up on cheese bread before the skewers begin arriving. You'll also find that the premium skewers can be hard to find. The guys with the cheaper meat cuts visit you more often. Saying no to the cheaper guys -- waiting for the better stuff -- will get you a visit from an assistant manager who will ask you what is wrong. Being truly selective about what you want is frowned upon? $85? Not for me."}
{"text":"Multinational churrascaria chain that summarizes Vegas in general pretty well at this location, which is a lot of price and several of the trappings of high end without ever quite going all the way over. They sort of gamely tried, but the salad bar (aside from the outstanding Italian meat selection) and sides were definitely second rate compared to several of the actual higher end places of this type I've been to. While their Pão de Queijo was acceptable, it was far from one of the better versions I've had of this. Same with their Brazilian lemonade and same with the Crème Brulee, but by that point, I wasn't really expecting anything other.   Service was mixed and I mention this because out of all of the trips to the table, easily 60 - 70% were offering the House Sirloin, which got to be fairly tiresome. They also did not have a lot of the usual staples I come to expect and anticipate and that was also annoying. Meats were fine, but there is more commonality in the flavoring and even how they cook it than not. No real complaints as to cooking style or flavor at all. It was all quite delectable, for the most part, but they could definitely use a much wider variety of meats. One would hope that the staff would gauge their offerings better, particularly for the expense, but that they do not because they are not forced to do so is perhaps more indicative of the cynicism pervasive in Vegas than anything else."}
{"text":"Fogo is always good in any of its nation wide locations. This time I was at Austin and took a client to lunch. Extremely awesome service, meat cooked to perfection. Not. I have can go wrong here."}
{"text":"It is located in a mall and we were seated outside next to the line to come into the restaurant so lots of spectators to our meal. The servers did an OK job taking care of us but be sure to tell them what meat you want. We got a discount voucher from Tix4Tonight and I'm glad that we did. I wouldn't have been happy to pay full price."}
{"text":"I took my wife here last month for her birthday and it was the best steakhouse we have ever eaten at. The service was superb and the food was excellent. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Fago de Chao today for our Anniversary it was disappointing to say the least. I am also a Private Chef and they were gracious enough to let me tour the kitchen but the meat  was over done and dry. The salad bar was really good with lots of variety. One of the  servers was exceptionally nice he's the one that gave me the tour and brought us an Anniversary dessert that was very good. I would just expect that since the main excitement of the Resturant was all the meat that it should be cooked exceptionally well, juicy and moist.We visit a lot of restaurants for the cuisine and the atmosphere and this one unfortunately won't be on our list for a return visit at these prices especially."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our 10th wedding anniversary last week and it could not have been a better experience. We got there just after they re-opened for the dinner hours around 5:15pm and were immediately seated. They explained the system with the green/red disc and off we went. EVERYONE was friendly and very knowledgeable. I have to mention Chris and Lou. You guys went above and beyond the service you usually get from anywhere. If these guys aren't management, they need to be. They stopped by to check on us a few times but not enough to be annoying. We were given a creme brulee from Chris at the end of our dinner and also engaged in some friendly conversations as well. My wife LOVED it. The meats were amazing(we tried almost all of them). I really only had one complaint and that is the pork ribs were not \"fall-off-the-bone\" like most rib places serve them and how we like them. They were a little tough. Keep doin what your doin because your doin everything right. We will be back for sure. Thanks FdC for a great anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this but we didn't have a good experience.  We went for my birthday(3/29 8PM). We were seated quickly (in a back room) and the 1st server was pleasant. That's where things went wrong. While we went off to the salad bar, we were told bread, water, etc. would be brought to our table. We returned 10 mins later, no water, no bread, no server to be found. Eventually, a young server happened upon our table and was surprised we had no bread, water or PLATES. Went off to see too it. Another 3 or 4 similar visits and someone else asked us if we needed something. I said, yup, water, bread and PLATES (we still couldn't have any of the meat coming around as we had no where to put it) and a manager.  The manager arrived and asked what we needed and, well, yeah, had to point that out to him too as if it wasn't pretty clear we had no plates after 20-25 mins sitting there with nothing to do but toy with the salad scraps.  Off he went.... more time passed and eventually we got the water, bread and some plates bit by bit. One would think he would have quickly resolved this but nope. BTW Skip the bread or whatever those round balls of doughy things were in the basket.   The meats.... most of them were dry and they cut pieces off the outsides which were hard crust. There were two that were fairly good (rib eye and top round) and my dinner companion enjoyed the pork encrusted with parm. By the time we were situated, the servers had stopped making the rounds in the back two rooms.  Most everyone left  One most interesting things was at one point, our \"server\" (young maybe 20s I swear his picture is the one in the additional tips for the business offered...get rid of him) that was supposed to bring a plate was so busy chatting and flirting with a couple at another table (he was there a good 10-15 mins and over and over - taking a business card from the female) and the rest of the \"servers\" who were not making the rounds with meats were grouped in a bunch talking... it was a wonder the \"manager' didn't make some effort to stop the behaviors.  The server with the plate in his hand finally managed to drop it in front of me without even looking down at us or saying a word before running back to his discussion across the room.  Me, I would have fired him on the spot as it was THAT BAD.  Salad bar - lame at best. It looked nice but not really much to speak of for such a huge place that is high-end price-wise. For instance, the tomatoes were a main item - they shouldn't have been served they were so under ripe - just one example.  Sides -  Slapped down like an after thought on our table - Mash potatoes that were horrible - had to be from freeze dried. For that matter, the mash potatoes from freeze dried at the market are better by a factor of 10.  What's with you  Fogo de Chao!  Honestly, I can't imagine that the review I saw here relate to the food in this place. Just because they have a lot of different meats (17 we were told) does not make a place a good value or the food well prepared.   I could not WAIT to get out of there and wrote \"HORRIBLE SERVICE\" on the check. My comment was we could have eaten at one of the very best steak places in the valley for the same price range compared to this horrible service/food that was equal to a buffet line and meat that shouldn't have been served in 9 times out of 10 samples we had. I left with a greasy feeling in my stomach.  The worst highlight - sitting without plates for 15-20 mins. and the manager having to be asked if he saw anything particularly wrong with that.  Sitting there in an almost empty room (3 tables out of 20) and NO servers coming around. Watching one of the waiters talk to a female guest at a table for what seemed like all evening at various points - I hope she has a job for you because if your management sees your behavior, hopefully, they get rid of you before they lose any more customers.  Keep in mind that this is not a 2 dinners for $20 special. This is a $50 a person plus extra's Scottsdale higher end eatery.  Although, it was worse than Applebees and that is saying A LOT.  NEVER again."}
{"text":"How have I not been here already?! I thought Rei do Gado in SD was good... but Fogo de Chao blows RDG out of the water. FDC is located off the strip sort of by Lawry's. We wanted to try a buffet for lunch and figured we'd try Fogo since we love Brazilian BBQ. Best decision for lunch I've ever made in Vegas.  It was $26.50 during lunchtime for 15 different cuts of meat. The service was impeccable and the meats melted in my mouth. This is a really nice place and I'm so happy that the staff welcomed us with open arms. Once you sit down, you can peruse through the salad bar for your sides. I'm smart enough to know not to fill up on that stuff though... you have to save your stomach for the meat and get your money's worth. There's a card where your seat is with a green and red side -- green light and red light if you will, for the sake of letting the staff know if you want meat or if you want to take a break. Once I flipped my green side up, the meat kept coming non-stop. I could barely even take one bite before the next guy came with the next cut. It wasn't long until I had a take a break from the action.   FDC is the best Brazilian churrascaria I've ever been to. The meats were fantastic and my party received nothing short of great service. I definitely didn't get my money's worth, but the meat was so good that I don't even care!"}
{"text":"Great place , prices are higher than expected. Over all will go again and gladly pay it."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this chain for quite some time and since we were staying very close we decided to do dinner big our last night in town. It's a very different dining experience since you don't really get a good menu. The salad bar is nice with a lot of good choices but the real star of the meal is all of the different and delicious cuts of meat you get to enjoy. If you love meat I can't recommend this place enough. My husband was in heaven here. Toward the end it was a little much for me and I think that when we return I would want to eat the salad with my meat because it would break it up a bit. We also enjoyed an amazing creme brûlée that was probably one of the best I have ever had. The service was amazing very top quality and ever present whenever we needed anything."}
{"text":"Great food! Love that cheese bread and yellow appetizer sticks. Fillet mignon and chicken in bacon is sooo good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the Las Vegas Restaurant Week $40 dinner special last night and what a deal!  This was my first visit to Fogo and it left a great impression.  First of all, the $40 promotion to benefit Three Square Food Bank appealed to us because this dinner is usually about $20 more on the regular menu AND my husband needs that protein.  The Brazilian steakhouse experience is included, which means all access to the salad bar complete with soup, rice, black bean stew (feijoada), and more.  Sides are also all-you-can-eat ,which were that addicting cheese bread (pao de queijo), crispy polenta, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas.  The main course is the meat which includes most of the offerings on the regular menu for Restaurant Week except filet mignon and maybe one or two other meats.  However, we were quite satisfied with what we had with favorites being the Picanha (top sirloin) and Fraldinha (bottom sirloin).  Dessert choice for both of us was the Tres Leches cake, which we somehow had room for--delicious!  Service was quite attentive, especially for such a busy establishment.  You can't wrong with this kind of meal, especially if you are a carnivore, that also benefits a wonderful charity.  I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his parents took me out here to dinner for my birthday, and it was AMAZING! The salad bar is so good. Definitely your money's worth.  It was kind of overwhelming at one point because once your flip your card to green on your table, they come flocking in all at once with various kinds of meat that you can choose from either medium well or medium rare. The brown sugar caramelized plantains they give you for sides were SO GOOD. Dessert was also delicious. I got a molten chocolate cake that had \"Happy Birthday\" beautifully written on it with a bday cake.  I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Great service! Amazing flavors! Scalloped potatoes and flank steak are the winners for me! Oh... Wait! Allow me to mention the smoked salmon on the salad bar! Lunch price is a great deal! My mom will only eat well done meat, they totally accommodated her request. One of my favorites places! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best service and steak you can find. I will come here over Texas de Brazil any day. I will never get enough of this place. AMAZING & DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"As primarily a pescatarian this was an adventure way off the normal path. I was intrigued with the concept of the Brazilian steakhouse and the 'gaucho' way of creating a meal, so off we went. Looking to take it the full experience of what it was about and leaving the consequences of creating a massive slug of meat in my system for later.  The dining experience does not offer a menu of choices, instead what you have is a fixed dining experience. First is the salad buffet which is really quite fabulous. Everything I had was very fresh and quite tasty. Hearts of palm, artichoke bottoms, massive asparagus that is surprisingly crisp yet completely free of stringiness, and much more. It may have only been the starter yet it could have easily been the meal in itself -- not because of it being a bottomless buffet but rather because I found the quality and range of taste that good.  When you finish your salad a waiter quickly comes by to swap out your dirty plate for a clean one and then it is up to you to turn your service chip from red to green. Upon doing so what could be described as a swarm of waiters with various cuts of meat start stopping at your table to allow you to select different wellness pieces of their offerings. Everything is carried about on swords where either the pieces of meat are deskewered (in the case of something like the sausages or pork chops) or sliced into your personal tongs.  The problem I have here is separating all of the styles that came so fast to understand what I liked the best. There were a few that did indeed stand out but if you are coming for a visit there is no reason not to try all that is offered to find your on personal favorites. And there is also not a problem turning something away if you want to skip it (like I did with the chicken offerings that came around) or requesting something that did not seem to be making it to your table on its own (like what happened to us with the pork ribs). There are also sides of warm cheese bread, polenta, garlic mashed potatoes (that are incredibly light), and caramelized bananas on the table that they do a great job of keeping refreshed -- though I had a hard time even remembering they were there as I focused in on tasting the meat!  Of course I ended up eating way too much and for a someone who does not eat meat, but maybe once or twice a year, I would say I really enjoyed the experience. I was glad someone else ordered the molten chocolate cake dessert at the table so I could have a taste to top the night off!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wend to Fogo for our anniversary and we both loved this place! My favorites were the crispy polenta, lamb chops, and lombo. I also loved the farmers market table, the variety is amazing and it is very fresh! Go with a big appetite as it is difficult not to try everything. This is hands down the best restaurant we have ever been to. The servers are wonderful, the food is delightful, and the atmosphere is elegant and comfortable. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because of the prices. As good as everything was; it is, in my opinion, CRAZY EXPENSIVE. I wish we could afford to visit Fogo de Chao again."}
{"text":"Lu took great care of us! Phenomenal food! Will recommend to everyone that I know! Delicious lamb chops. Dessert was to die for."}
{"text":"My husband and I made Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse our date night dinner location recently because he got tipped 2 free dinners by the location's manager. We made a reservation through their website and were seated right away when we showed up. From start to finish we received excellent service from then staff.  Since we had never eaten at a Brazilian Steakhouse, we were unfamiliar with how it works as we were expecting an menu with entrees to choose on. We were mistaken in the greatest way as its an all you can eat buffet/ Steakhouse for one very fair price per person, about $55.  When you arrive to your table you notice in the middle of the room there is a large circular buffet table with salads, cheese, Italian meats, and other various side dishes. Your server will then give you a two-sided card, colored green and red. Green tells the servers with various meats to approach your table to see if your interested and if so you let them know how you want it cooked (the sample has all the various types of temperature already prepared). If you want a specific type of meat you just let them know and it will be delivered to you. The staff are very knowledgeable, so I suggest getting their recommendations if you don't have a particular meat in mind. If you flip your card to red, the meat servers know not to approach you.  In our experience, within 30 seconds of flipping the card back to green, we had 4 different servers provide samples of mouth watering steaks! My personal favorite was the filet mignon!  So if you are planning a unique dining experience, I highly recommend Fogo De Chao! Word of advice, go starving since it's an all you can eat and try not filling up at the buffet table and getting in as many steak choices as possible."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Brazilian bbq place of all. Meat is super high quality and salad bar is awesome. Good selection, fresh... They have a good house wine that is not too expensive and is pretty good. Goes well with the meats."}
{"text":"Great place! I went with a group of people here last week and the experience was great! Food was good. Service was good. Environment was warm and welcoming. Will continue going back in the future."}
{"text":"I ate here with my friends about a week ago after we signed up for their E-Club at the Downtown Summerlin Farmer's Market. We were seated right away and greeted by the friendly staff.   After the whole spiel we got up to head towards their market table. There was a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, deli meats, cheeses, and they also had soup and rice. I try not to fill myself up with the salad bar only because I want to save more room for the meat.  After we sat back down, the meat service began. The gaucho chefs were very thoughtful and would even ask us if their was any cut of meat that we would like to request. Their lamb chops are my absolute favorite! A close second would have to be the house special picanha. My friends seemed to really enjoy the bottom sirloin and picanha as well!  Great service and awesome food. If there is just one thing I could say, it is a bit on the pricier side. I suggest coming hungry so you eat your money's worth!"}
{"text":"If you like to eat different kinds of steaks and meat, this place is for you! The ambience in this restaurant was beautiful, and lighting was great as well.  The food is overall is great. I will definitely be coming back with my family. The only think is its a little more pricey than other Brazilian steak spots, but definitely one of our go to spots when we have a bit more money :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to Fogo De Cháo.  First thing I'd like to point out is that their food and service was great. One thing that really got to me was when I asked if they gave a military discount. I showed them my ID as proof. They said they do. I don't know if I did something to offend them by asking. They gave me a discount, but it was $3.70 discount on a $156.8 bill (before tax). $3.70 is like a 2% discount.  I usually ask everywhere I eat if they give a military discount.  If an establishment doesn't give a discount,  I'm ok with it, you just have to say so. 2% off my tab defeats the purpose. Why give me any discount at this point."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic way to end 2017. Brunch was Amazing with enormous amount of food! Cameron was our waiter; he was magnificent!! He was respectful, attentive, sociable, and new what he was talking about. He made our party feel comfortable and we enjoyed his personality.  Not to mention he had an incredible amount of patience for kids!!   The food, wow the food was delicious!! The amount of fresh food was overwhelming but I couldn't have asked for anything less.  I tried just about everything and I was never disappointed with every single bite.  They had many different types of meats to choose from! It was so hard not to love them all.  The fried bananas were wonderful and the mashed potatoes were creamy and satisfying.   The entire staff was friendly and on top of stuff. They pulled out our chairs and pushed us back in. It was a fantastic dining experience.    This is a must try at least once!! You won't be disappointed I promise."}
{"text":"Chose to go here for an anniversary dinner for both my husband and I, and my mother and step-father. We were not disappointed.  The salad bar is spectacular. Cured meats, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, soups, and different salads are all present. Buffalo mozzarella and manchego cheese are two of my personal favorites.   The waiters provide you with an extensive spit-roasted meat selection, perfectly seasoned. While I do not eat red meat, the chicken and pork were cooked to perfection and even the flank steak was good. The garlic sirloin is the best meat there.   The waitstaff were professional, polite, and attentive to customers. Our glasses were never empty, and the manager came over twice to ensure our experience was top-notch. He also did not charge for my children (all 3 of them) which was surprising and very appreciated!"}
{"text":"Nice Brazilian Churrascaria  in Vegas.  I have been to 3 churrascaria's in my life (although multiple times to each one) and I have to say, the other two both had better meat than Fogo. This is not to say that the meat at Fogo isn't good, just that the meat at the others is better.  Fogo DEFINITELY had better service than the other two however, and it's not even close! As soon as we turned the disc over to green (which means bring me meat) we were swarmed with more meat that you could ever ask for. Often at the other churrascaria's we have had to wait for meat, or wait for a specific meat. Not here. If your disc is green they are right there immediately to give you your fill.  Their salad bar was very good as well including an amazing apple salad I considered asking if they sold to go, it was so good   But if you go to a churrascaria you aren't there for salad, you are there for the meat. The sirloin was the best of the meats. The bacon wrapped filet was tasty but the cut of meat wasn't great. The Brazilian sausage was a little disappointing compared to other places, but was still good. The chicken was again, not as good as the other places, but still tasty.  Based on just the food I would give them 3 stars, but the services definitely upped the rating to 4 stars.  Oh, I also had the Brazilian lemonade which was incredible. Not at all what you would expect when someone says lemonade. It was lime and milk based, but was very light and refreshing. Their sodas come in bottles with no free refills so I tried the \"lemonade\" instead which does have refills. Glad I did too, because it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Well, the sign and the website say the restaurant opens at 4PM.   I've been standing outside for nearly 15 minutes and the doors are still locked shut, and nobody answers the phone.  There are several other folks here waiting to get in as well.  Quite the disappointment."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here a couple times a year because they always have specials, such as bogo vouchers on Valentine's Day - each person gets a voucher for 1 free meal the next month. I'm fairly certain that they do this offer for Mothers' & Fathers' Day.  Ambiance is nice, the meats are good, but why 3 stars?  The salad bar doesn't hold a candle to the salad bar at Texas De Brazil. Not only are Fogo's choices not as good, the salad bar is considerably smaller for the same price. Chimi churri isn't on the salad bar, nor is it delivered to your table, so you'll just have to ask for it.  Also, aside from the cheese bread (amazing) the sides are horrible. The plantains are overcooked into a mush and the semolina sticks are always cool and tough. Getting a water refill is like pulling teeth.  If you want beef ribs, good luck. Before we had even sat in our chairs the last time we ate here (2/14/18,) I told our waiter we'd like to have beef ribs because we know that it always takes a long time to get out. We were assured that they made extra for Valentine's Day. We finally got beef ribs 4 or 5 more requests later, right before we got the check, about an hour and a half after we originally asked for them. The table next to us got a free dessert because they were upset that they asked for picanha more that 8 times while we ate - and it never came.  Service is spotty, salad bar is meh, but unlike Texas De Brazil at Town Square, you can actually hear yourself think and they don't overstuff the dining room with tables so that you're squashed between a million other people.   I know we'll be back, I just wished they had the salad bar of Texas De Brazil (lobster bisque!!!)  and that service was more uniform."}
{"text":"I had dinner there this past Saturday 8/12, we usually go to the one off the strip and thought that this would be a nice change because of the location .   When we arrived the hostess was not there and waited to be checked in , a server notice we were standing there and asked if we needed a table . As he was walking us in the hostess took over.  The servers were not attentive at all , we had to ask for our side dishes and drinks . The salad bar was good but everything was about empty."}
{"text":"Quantity over quality. The salad bar is decent and so are the sides, like the potatoes etc. however not a fan of the meats. Most of them are over cooked and over salted."}
{"text":"Came here because we had a free dinner and it expires soon. The restaurant here is smaller than the fogo de chao off flamingo. As soon as we entered the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess and sat right away. They have 2 beers on tap but have plenty of wine and cocktails to choose from. The meat cutters were all nice and if we needed it a little more done or if we wanted a certain meat they were more than willing to get it done. Our server which I forgot her name was also very nice... Always made sure water was full and had clean plates. I'll def come back again!"}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations after visiting other Brazilian steak houses in different cities.  First time visiting one in Scottsdale.  The salad bar was disappointing, they have a poor selection compare to other Brazilian steak houses I have visit.  The meat was average, was not as flavor as I would expect.  The service was slow, but they were very busy the night we came.  Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and set up for a restaurant. Salad bar had rare vegetables, make sure to be hungry when going to this place '' a lot of meat''.  would recommend making a reservation since the seating was a bit slow. Overall I would probably come back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"i was lucky enough to be invited to the soft opening at FOGO!  throughout my whole experience, we received the greatest service from the FOGO staff. morgan recommended the best meats and knew her pairings with the sauces. my favorite was the chimichurri and the hot sauce. the meats were non stop and everything was delicious. i loved their PICANHA steak and couldn't stop eating it. it was seasoned so well and i love how it was thinly sliced with a bit of fat on the side. i couldn't stop asking for more. my card was always on the GREEN GO side.   the market table provided a variety of veggies, cheeses, deli meats, salmon, rice, and many more! i like how you can keep going back for more. the server was saying that fogo is an all you can experience. my favorite was the fresh mozzarella cheese, quinoa kale salad, prosciutto, and baby corn. the brazilian cheese bread was the BEST part of them all. i couldn't stop eating them! very addicting. fogo also provides caramelized bananas to help cleanse your tasting palette. i thought it was very accommodating and a good idea.   the service is top notch at fogo. my party and i felt so welcomed by the friendly staff. our drinks were constantly refilled and our plates were always changed. the staff also had this tool to clean the crumbs off the table and thought it was great! the restaurant is super clean and very modernized. i would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night or a special occasion. i can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"I was thouroughly impressed by Fogo de Chao, their staff and the food.  I have always been a big fan of another, similar place (unnamed) place in town, so I knew what to expect in general.  It was very crowded, which is nice to see for a newer restaurant.  Granted, it was Saturday night, but it was still nice to see.  The restaurant is in a good location, not too far from the strip and easily accessible.  They offer complimentary valet, which is good, because I am not sure we would have found a parking spot otherwise.  The staff was amazing.  Everyone was very friendly.  I found it interesting when I learned that the entire restaurant is not open yet.  They are opening each section slowly so that they can ensure everyone is getting the best, most personalized service.  To the food:  I am definitely a carnivore, so this is like heaven for me.  Glad I saved my appetite, because there is TONS of food.  The salad bar is very authentic.  No sushi or soups to be found.  A great selection of salads, breads, cheese and charcuterie.  I had a small plate of salad, with some asparagus and cucumbers, but I didn't waste any time flipping my coaster from red to green.  Bring on the MEAT!  I tried a little bit of everything.  All of the meat was of very good quality, but my favorites were the house special (garlic sirloin), filet mignon and ribeye.  I couldn't tell you what their actual Brazillian names are.  :)  The meat was cooked perfectly - and the Gauchos are happy to accommodate special requests, like if you would prefer your meat more well done, they will get it for you.  The bacon wrapped chicken was very tender and juicy, as was the chicken leg and sausage.  I am not a fan of lamb chops, but had a couple of bites anyway.  It was OK, but that may be just because it is not my thing.  I was also not a fan of the top or bottom sirloin, but that is more because the filet and ribeye are so dang delicious and perfect, that the lesser cuts of meat got pushed aside! ;)Every meal is served with a side of fried polenta (interesting and different), garlic mashed potatoes (topped with chives and cheese, delicious) and fried plantains (to cleanse the palate between meats).  We also had dessert.  We shared creme brulee and key lime pie.  The creme brulee was nothing spectacular, but good.  The key lime pie was AWESOME!  Definitely some of the best I have ever had.  I found everything to be very good.  From the food, to the ambiance, to the service.  I think that the price ($46.50 for dinner and $26.50 for lunch) is reasonable, considering the service and the all-you-can-eat style.  That is cheaper than some strip hotel buffets in town, and at least you know that all of your food is prepared fresh.  They also have a great wine selection, and although you should dress business casual, it is not mandatory."}
{"text":"Wow great food and atmosphere.  All you can eat, and then some. If you are a carnivore this is the place for you. I highly recommend,  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, ok service.   We had to ask for certain cuts of meat that were not brought out to us. That shouldn't have to happen.   Otherwise, good experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by to have lunch Asked to have the salad bar and eat at the bar as I had to make some calls and did not want to be that person on the phone in a restaurant but the manager said no.  I left and had a great meal and service at PF Chang across the street."}
{"text":"First let me thank my yelp friend Kelly O., for talking me into trying Fogo. Sending you big ol hugs Kelly. Thank you.  One word to describe Fogo de Chao? Incredible!  The salad bar was huge and looked great. But I didn't come to a Brazilian Steakhouse to eat green stuff. After all, that's what real food eats. Bring on the meat!!! And bring it they do. Never ending. Succulent. Tender. Juicy. Flavorful. Glorious meat. Everything I tried was fantastic. And I do mean everything... And I tried it all!  But fair warning to the rookies... Pace yourselves. If you gorge, which is very easy to do, you'll find yourself slipping into a meat drunk food coma.  The place is beautiful and clean. Parking is not an issue at all. Service was attentive, friendly, polite, and fast.  I will definitely be back... With loose waisted jeans on."}
{"text":"The hubby and I had Thanksgiving dinner at Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse in Las Vegas and it did not disappoint.  It was our very first visit here and it definitely won't be our last.  We had reservations since they tend to get very busy and were seated right away.  We've heard nothing but rave reviews about this restaurant so this time in town we just had to try it.  I suggested this place for the hubby since he is a total meat lover and even he was impressed (he's very hard to please when it comes to food).  After you sit down with your open salad bar selections they give you a round card that you place on your table.  Flip it to the red side and they won't bother you, flip it to the green side and they will stop by your table with all sorts of mouth watering grilled meats grilled right on some long metal rods.  When you're done flip it back to red, when you're ready for more flip it back to green.  The sauce they served to enjoy with their meats was really good, I think it was maybe olive oil based with cilantro, peppers, and chopped up garlic?  The meats were all tender and perfectly grilled, I am salivating just thinking about it.  I believe they had over 18 different meat varieties along with roasted turkey since it was Thanksgiving.  By the time we were done we were both ready to fall asleep right then and there on the table, but not before getting a chance to try their famous flan.  It was yummy and smooth and had just the right amount of sweetness...  Fogo do Chao is definitely a must try whether you are a vegetarian or a meat lover, everyone will be pleased.  I cannot possibly even think about visiting Las Vegas next time without stopping here for dinner.  Staff were all super attentive and quick, and the food/ambience was top notch.  Definitely the spot to have dinner at least once if you ever stop in sin city."}
{"text":"Here it is a month later and I can still confidently say it was the best food and service  I have ever had. But I'll keep eating out and looking for other places to try in the off-chance I find something better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I literally cannot say enough positive about this place.  While looking for a place to take our clients when they visit us from all over the world, we went to both Texas de Brasil (Town Square) and Fogo de Chão.   The food is actually pretty close. But the service was NO COMPETITION at all.  At TdB we received what I'd call above average service and so about a week later we visited FdC. The service was IMPECCABLE - even for a first time guest and a party of two. They went out of their way to anticipate EVERYTHING we would need.  Since that first visit over two years ago - we've visited with family, had date nights, taken multiple parties of 10-20 people and even had a few groups of 50+ here. They have ALWAYS exceeded our expectations.  This is quite clearly the BEST SERVICE of any restaurant in Las Vegas (which is saying a LOT considering the competition here) and one of the TOP SERVICE restaurants of any restaurant I've been in worldwide.   The service really is THAT GOOD!  The management team is ALWAYS on the floor making sure the dining experience flows for everyone - whether they are slow (just after opening for the evening) or packed out (usually from 7pm onward until closing.  LOCALS - go early! 6pm is usually when their best servers come onto shift and the convention crowd doesn't usually pick up until closer to 7. So you have the best service and also avoid the longer lines that sometimes happen a little later.  YOU CANNOT GO WRONG with this restaurant, whether date night or a huge party. They have a delicious Sea Bass if a couple of your guests don't eat like a starved carnivore and also my Vegan clients always rave about the Market Table (Buffet and Salad Service).  There is almost NOTHING within reason that they won't do to meet every need. So go there with all confidence. In 2 years I've probably spent close to $80-100k in this restaurant and I have NEVER regretted a visit. EVER!"}
{"text":"Hmm Texas de Brazil or Fogo? That was the question on my brain yesterday morning and I couldn't decide so like a fatty I went to Fogo for lunch and Texas for dinner. Fogo is good but between the two it is definitely a toss up. Fogo has the better decor,, service was 5 stars and very attentive, good wine selection, and for some reason I liked their thick forks....i know weird. But anyway, its all about the food and I think Fogo's salad bar is amazing and has way more vegetables than Texas and their asparagus stalks are huge. They also have a good selection of cheeses and cold cuts as well but I didn't notice any hot dishes (maybe because it was lunch). Texas on the other hand had more choices of hot side dishes which is nice but I would much rather have more of a selection of vegetables.    I do have to say I liked Texas meat better than Fogos. The bacon wrapped chicken at Texas is damn good but for some reason the chicken and some of the sirloins at Fogos were extremely dry. I didn't even want to finish the rest of my bacon wrapped chicken because it was that dry and I mean damn how are you gonna mess up something with bacon on it? (noticed i said \"didn't want to\" oh i still ate it tho ...but begrudgingly) But the rest of the meat: the lamb, the house meat Picanha and the bacon wrapped sirloin, da-yamn! Yeah I'll be back."}

Minh and Tucker were always there to refill our mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas or anything else we needed. We will definitely go there again. Definitely sign up for their e-club! you get a discount for your birthday and anniversary months!"}
{"text":"Service,food and salad bar was great!!! All meats where great, but my family was all in agreement the pork ribs where HORRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"The food was great  service was amazing specially with our waiter Minh . Great experience"}
{"text":"Amazing food , Amazing service! Highly encourage everybody to experience this place at least once!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome the meat selection was spectacular one little hiccup they forgot the side dishes that you get with your meal but they more than made up for it and I was not disappointed I did not realize there was a gaff Until one of the wait staff said where are your side's oh well . We got here in between lunch and dinner when there was a staff change so no big deal if you want to get your meat sweats on this is the place"}
{"text":"After knowing about, but never having lived near a Fogo de Chao, I was very excited for my first visit. I visited on  Thursday night with a group of about 50. Service was dismal. I had to flag down a waiter after sitting without a drink for over 10 minutes. It took that long to get the drink & the waiter stood in the middle of the room with no idea who to give it to. We asked repeatedly for hot rolls, only to get a basket of 5 cold rolls for our table of 10. The meat was rarely brought back to the room. They would go to the large table first, ran out of meat, and never return. If we asked for rare, they would promise to return, never to come back. When the waiter came to ask what we wanted for dessert, I told him I had only had 3 pieces of meat and would like more. We finally got tired of waiting for food and, after most of our party of 50 had departed, we gave up & left too. In total I had a lamb chop, a small cut of filet, a tiny sausage, and 2 chicken wings. Not worth $50. I would have had more than one glass of wine if the waiter had ever come around and asked. I also would have appreciated not having to ask repeatedly for everything, down to a glass of water (hot rolls, hot potatoes, more bananas since 4 pieces isn't enough for a table of 10). Everyone at the table was complaining to each other that they were still hungry. I would not recommend this place for large groups. Small parties may work, but they are far too disorganized and unwilling to serve. I would not ever expect to have left hungry, but I did."}
{"text":"Fogo De Chao in Las vegas was good, but I felt that the meat was a bit more salty then how the fogo de chao in Beverly Hills prepared their food. It could have been just an off day but the service was great and the desert was delicious. The creme Brulee  and flan was very sweet satisfied my sweet tooth. Was over all worth the trip off the strip to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best Brazilian in Vegas is just excellent!!! I had an amazing experience, 5 starts service, the food oh my gosh! Stick with the meat don't get full with the sides or anything else because you'll need the space! Dessert? Crème brûlée! They make it there is so SO good! Is not cheap but is so worth it I promise! Today we were only me and my husband I had a glass of Cabernet and we had dessert (1) and 2 espressos so the whole thing with the food included (all u can eat) and tip of 18% the bill was $162 that's not bad all!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. 1 Star for service, it was the slowest and most frustrating service I've ever experienced. They were good about refilling drinks but it went downhill from there. The salad bar never was full of all the items. All the meats we requested were never delivered and additional sides were never brought. We got our rolls 3/4 of the way through the meal. We waited AN HOUR (if not more) to pay the check, other tables around us were waiting as well."}
{"text":"I had dinner at this place for my daughter's bday and we treated as Kings and Queens the food the service the atmosphere everything was amazing I will be dining here again in the very near future"}
{"text":"*military discount*  .  Went on Saturday 2-6-16 at about 6:45 PM. We waited in the bar and ordered a jack & coke and a regular coke for $16.49.  About 30 minutes later we were seated and we each chose the full churrascaria experience and a dessert and the total was a little over $114 after the discount.   .  Their salad bar has some unusual items on it like smoked salmon, hearts of palm, quinoa tabouleh, and kale salad and also some familiar items like caesar salad, sweet potato casserole complete with marshmallows on top, black beans, rice, soup, and a charcuterie board.   .  We sat down with salads and then it was like being hit by a meat tornado. We tried ribs, parmesean pork, bacon chicken, bacon beef, top sirloin, and garlic sirloin.  None of the meat was particularly tender.  My jaw was a little sore the rest of the night from all the chewing.  The side dishes were not very good.  The mashed potatoes tasted instant and were covered in ginormous cracked peppercorns which made them hard to eat.  The polenta was room temperature and bland, but the bananas were quite tasty. That cheesy bread is something magical and with a little bit of butter it is divine.   Their chimichurri is also delicious and it reminds me of a very herbal italian dressing.   .  Service was indifferent except for the rodizio guys who were more friendly than our server but less courteous than they could be.  The best part of the meal was the dessert which was called \"strawberry cream\" and topped with a beautiful orchid.  It was a glorified milkshake but delicious and I loved every bite.  .  I've been to TDB 3 or 4 times and we decided to try this place out for shiggles. Fogo de Chao is not for me.  Sorry I cheated on you, TDB!!! TAKE ME BACK!"}
{"text":"Have been to Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse in Summerlin several times and LOVE it !! I have always had excellent service and think the Market Table (salad bar) is one of the best in this town. The meat service is overwhelming at times but that is the fun of the meal in the first place. I would give them 10 stars if that option was available !! This type of dining isn't for everyone but you should try it at least once."}
{"text":"Meat was amazing! Service was Great! Make sure to always get their \"Picanha\" which is their house specialty..it is to die for! Make sure to get it Medium Rare!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is great - but the price is far too high for what you get. I like everything just fine, but $150 for two people for some meat and veggies is just too much IMO."}
{"text":"Nothing special it's quantity not quality steak is either too salty or bland cocktail was decent but then again don't just go to restaurants to drink I go to eat. Couldn't find anything that I liked the pork was decent steak was garbage this is saying something outback could probably provide a steak better if not the same. Would not go back for the price could have went to Ruth's Chris. Had to also get out of my chair and get my own plate and cutlery to end here won't be returning"}
{"text":"On Saturday night I attended my daughter's bachelorette party, our group consisted of 13 women. While the food was good, service okay, etc I got violently ill later that night as did my other daughter: not the bride. I wasn't able to go far from a bathroom until last night & still can't keep anything down.  Had very little from the salad bar other than some fruit & cheese. Only ate the steak, no pork or whatever else they offered. Something bad was going around there that night - thank goodness it was just the two of us but who knows if anyone else bothers to post negative comments. I wonder how often this happens?  Last time I got food poisoning was at a KFC in 1980.  Fortunately i'm feeling better today: the wedding is this Wednesday, big rehearsal dinner is tomorrow. Have to say Fogo was a big disappointment  the one star is because the manager offered to dry clean my table mates coat, which the servers kept dripping blood on."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We went to dinner at Fogo last week and were not disappointed.  The food was amazing. Best service I have had in a very long time. They definitely trained everyone well at this new location. Thank you for a great night!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best churasscaria I have ever tried. Brazilian bbq at its best! Everything is perfectly seasoned, but my personal favorite is the top sirloin.   The sides that come with the meal are great too.. there is cheese bread, fried plantains, and these two other things..... very delicious.  The salad bar has plenty to choose from, try a little bit of everything. Great selection. The service is ok/good, but occasionally we had to flag our waiter down. Reservations are highly recommended because this place gets packed.   The night my boyfriend and I went, we saw two players from the Golden State Warriors, and we saw Muhammed Ali. Apparently famous people come in all the time."}
{"text":"If you are a big fan of meat, this is the place for you. A constant rotation of meat servers walk around and offer you various cuts and you decide to accept or pass. The quality was very high, and cooked to anyone's liking. There is also a charcuterie bar that you can enjoy prior to embarking on a full blown meat coma!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome, no doubt. But the customer service was really disappointing. Our server was initially rude and wouldn't let us reject a bottle of wine we didn't like after tasting it. Why pour us tastes if we can't say that we don't like it? But he honestly just seemed inexperienced. He also didn't seem to know the wine list very well. I was upset so I spoke to a manager and she was very nice and she remedied the situation by bringing us a different bottle of wine.  But then the service just continued to suck. The worst part of the night for me was when a waiter actually made a comment about how much meat I had on my plate as he was clearing plates. He said \"You're really saving up over there!\" or something like that. Really dude?! It's an all-you-can eat steakhouse. I was grabbing as much meat as I could because we came in around 8:30 (still plenty of time before closing) and we felt like we were being rushed out the entire time. We only saw most cuts once, and a few cuts never even made it to our table which is fine, but I'm going to take as much as I can get if I feel rushed. But it just felt really unprofessional for a waiter to make a comment about how much a customer is eating. Then we had several waiters come by our table and try to rush us out almost as soon as it was almost 10:00. I know that they close at 10, so obviously we needed to get going, but it was a little excessive. Don't waiters have sidework they could be doing instead of pestering customers? There were still other customers eating, we weren't the last to leave. I paid so the server would get out of my hair and he made some comment about \"letting the cashier get out of here\" and then he made another snarky comment about the cashier needing to leave after I had already paid when he came back to pick up my signed check. To make things worse, he actually snatched my half-full glass of wine as he was leaving. My boyfriend was shocked.  So, I feel like Fogo de Chao is the kind of place where everyone from every income bracket comes at least once for a special occasion. I'm a teacher, I don't make a lot of money, but I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and I wanted it to be special for once. I spent almost $200 on the check, which is more than I would ever normally spend at a restaurant and I feel like when you spend that much you want to be treated like any other customer. Other than the manager, who was nice, everyone on the staff was pretty rude to us. And we shouldn't have come at 8:30, but if you're going to be rude and rush people out the door, don't accept customers past 8:00."}
{"text":"New hot Brazilian (steakhouse) in town. Chic, hip decor, good wine, and BBQ in the vein of the gaucho style all you can eat meateries. For the non meat lovers, they offer a popular Chilean sea bass or salmon option and a market table of fresh veggies, soups, cheeses, meats and smoked salmon that is worthy of a trip alone.   I think once you go once and eat everything and figure out your favorite meat to eat, the best value would be the Gaucho lunch with Meat selection or the Select Cuts for dinner. Both include the Market table. Parking is super convenient(the parking elevator literally lets you out right by the back entrance) and is free after four with validation during the week.   The restaurant felt a little too cool for me to break out my trusty iPhone to take some snaps, but I wanted to take some pictures of their beautiful market table. It is chock full of deliciousness.   It is not cheap and I can't imagine anyone eating there for lunch or dinner for less than $25-$75, esp. with a nice glass of wine (or two), but located in the old Sak's department store, it is a neat trip to see how well they repurposed the space."}
{"text":"For $50 a person service cannot get any better. The experience was incredible..there was never a second where I had to wait around for my drink or bread, as soon as the staff sees you're 1/3 of the way done with something, boom! they bring you more. The food was great! The salad bar is maintained fresh by having a staff member watching over it and refilling the trays whenever they start looking empty or unappealing. The staff in the front of the restaurant are really nice and make you feel comfortable from the get go. If you think it's a little pricey, just try it once for the great experience that they offer you!! It's worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderfull great time dinning with friends and family.  Junior the Philippines server, he was awesome all night one of the best help. It's a plus on my behalf....love the lamb."}
{"text":"Wonderful and classy environment. Went for my birthday and got a free dessert! Didn't get a whole lot of options for main course though which was disappointing, but still good for what we did get."}
{"text":"Great Salad Bar, and never mind the nonsense about not eating from it to save room for the meat... Fogo's salad bar is a 9 out 10."}
{"text":"So disappointing! We'd been waiting to get here for a year. Got all dressed up, hopped in our uber and headed out for what we thought would be a wonderful experience. SO MISTAKEN. two stars only because the wine was decent and the servers were pleasant  Best part of the meal? The salad bar. Meat was tough, over cooked, lacking flavor...awful. A $400 dinner and I've never felt so cheated by a restaurant.  The \"ambiance\" was that of a 3 star hotel buffet.  Not worth the money, or the 40 minute uber ride. We will not return. I advise you not to waste your money. A million other places much better and much less expensive."}
{"text":"Surprisingly I've never been to a churrascaria.  I mean I love roast meat so I don't know why I never have.  Turns out I love them!  Fogo de Chao was amazing.  We came in for lunch (as it is way better priced and you basically get the same things as you would for dinner) and I ate so much I didn't even eat dinner that day.  The servers walk around with different meats and come to your table if the green coaster is up.  You can go to the salad bar and get accompaniments.  Since I had never been here before I loaded up on the salad bar but I definitely did not need to.  The meats were all flavored well and distinctive and did not need any of the garlic and peppers I picked up.  I liked the fact that you could request specific meat.  The house special, the lamb chops, and the lamb steak were highlights.  The bread they serve is great, as well as the plantains and polenta sticks.  I would definitely venture in here again for lunch when I don't feel like moving for the rest of the day"}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Christina went above and BEYOND to make sure our small celebration was something to remember. The meat was fantastic try the garlic sirloin ! Will be back."}
{"text":"Had heard lots of things about this place and finally had to see for myself. Must say food and service is great, the only knock I had is it's a bit pricey so definitely a special occasion place and all though they kept coming around with different types of meat non stop most of them were rare, very hard to get some well done meat. But I would still recommend this place to everyone to try at least once. I would also recommend you go on an empty stomach because it's pretty much all you can eat of every steak, chicken and pork they serve with an all you can eat salad and fruit bar and yes don't forget the bean and linguica soup."}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 that had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse. Well just let me say that it won't be the last. We go to Las Vegas once a year for a line dance convention in November and we are already talking about our next reservations to Fogo de Chão in 2018. The food was absolutely delicious.      The staff was so much fun. Make sure you ask them questions. Keith the server who seated us was great. He got us started. Jose Ruiz was at our table talking about the restaurant and letting us know about how things work. He was super customer service representative.      The food was amazing and the drinks were pretty good also. Go hungry and start slow and pace yourself. You won't miss out on anything because they just keep bringing out meat right off the open pit oven. Make it a evening and not a quick dinner. It is not cheap but a great dining night.    A great dining experience.    Thanks Fogo de Chão"}
{"text":"This was perhaps the most over rated Brazilian steakhouse I've been to and it's not just the price but def not coming back."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Fogo de Chao for the longest time and I finally got the chance to. Overall, it was a decent meal but I wouldn't rate it among the best churrascaria places I've been to.   Being that this is Phoenix, and there aren't any high concentration of Brazilian/Portuguese populations nearby (at least that I'm aware of), I could see why people would love this. First off, it's all-you-can-eat and the meat is of decent quality (certainly better than any Asian buffet in the area).   Personally, my favorite were the beef ribs as it was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The other meats weren't bad, but it was a notch below what you would get at a high-end steakhouse. The meats were also of varying saltiness, with some of them being a bit too salty for my liking.   Salad bar was good but don't make the mistake of piling your plate there. After all, why would you pay $50 for raw and grilled veggies?   A bit nit-picky here, but I felt like the servers came inconsistently - at times, they would all come at once and there were moments when you'd be done with the meat and the next guy wouldn't come for at least a few minutes. Another complaint is that they don't have one of my favorite Brazilian bbq dishes - grilled pineapple with cinnamon!   It's not bad for what it is, but if you've had churrascia in ethnically Portuguese/Brazilian areas (like in Newark, NJ or Framingham, MA), you could do better for about half the price."}
{"text":"Went for my mother-in-law's birthday. The group of 12 loved every second of the meal.  Service was top-notch. Caiparihnas were the best I've ever had. The meats were excellent and plentiful. Dining room was nice and clean. But again, the service was really what put everything over the top! Thank you, Fogo de Chao!"}
{"text":"Decided to eat here today for lunch today with some friends that are locals.  The salad bar was very diverse, but a lot of the sides had strange flavors that did not blend well with the meats.  No soups either.  The meat was delicious!  The selection was very good as well.  Their website lists the choices pretty accurately.  The meat wasn't over flavored either.    All in all, a good place to eat, but the sides need work."}
{"text":"Our friend that lives in LV took us here for dinner. We started the night with the best Malbec I have ever had. It's one of their house wines. The bread was delicious, they have a sweet potato casserole that tastes like it has bananas in it-- it was heavenly.. Their beef ribs and lamb were my favorite meats. Our friends are regulars at this place so we got great service and the manager came to check on our table a few times.  I really enjoyed this place. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here few times before and every time I'm amazed at their service. There's always someone nearby for service. Water, side dishes, and bread bowl keeps getting refilled and dirty dishes cleared quickly. The salad bar is fresh and taste amazing. The BBQ has enough selection to please everyone. My favorite was the lamb. All you can eat salad bar which includes cold cut meat was $26 and with all you can eat BBQ it's $51. Well worth the money."}
{"text":"Flesh Fest!! If you love meat, you'll enjoy Fogo De Chao.   Our fist encounter with Fogo De Chao was in Houston a couple of years back. We were both impressed with the service and the food. Since then we have visited Fogo De Chao in Scottsdale and have loved every minute of each experience.   My husband and I came here for our first year anniversary. We made the mistake of eating a huge breakfast at Bill Johnsons Big Apple. One shouldn't do that if you plan on going to Fogo De Chao.   For New Years Eve we again visited Fogo De Chao with some friends. Service has been impeccable all three times we went (both in Houston and in Scottsdale). Our wine and water glasses were never empty and our table was always clean. The wait staff were kind and always remembered our favorite cuts of meat. The Lamb Chops are my favorite. The Bacon Wrapped Fillet Mignon is to die for!  I am a definate fan of Fogo De Chao!"}
{"text":"Awesome is the only description suitable for this place. The drinks, the meats, and overall service is truly amazing! I definitely will return. 5 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night and it was absolutely disgusting. To the point he literally had to spit his food out it was so fatty. Half of my plate was the scrappings of fat I had to trim off my pieces of meat. The salad bar had nothing to choose from other then cold veggies and hard rice. I was at Texas de Brazil in Chicago last week and for the exact same price you had triple the salad/ buffet bar, great meat vs this disgusting cheap cuts of meat offered here and even though everyone here was very nice, it took forever to get drinks, refills, and we had to ask for someone to clear our plates after an hour of being there. I will never be back and its a shame because theses places are normally wonderful."}
{"text":"Decor: 5/5 -Reservations are welcome -There is a private dining room for large parties -They can easily accommodate parties of 10+  Service: 5/5 -The meat will continuously come if you have the coaster on green. No joke.  -If there is a specific cut you want, just tell the server and they will bring it to you  Food: 4.5/5 -My favorite cuts were the top sirloin, ribeye, flank and filet mignon. All were full of flavor, cooked medium rare, not fatty or chewy. The flank was a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a bit pricey so it's definitely a special occasions place but the food and service is phenomenal! My favorite is the lemon pepper lamb but I don't really say no to any of the others ;)  I love the salad bar as well for all the options that aren't meat.  The bread they bring to the table are like little clouds of heavenly goodness, I could eat them all day."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We saw our waiter twice, never got my drink order, and had to get our own clean plates.  Bathrooms were filthy. The food was mediocre, you can get a better cut of meat at Sizzler. The salad bar was good, but not worth $53 pp. Skip this tourist trap and go anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"The service here is awesome.  The meats were good.  Its a bit pricey for dinner. But overall would recommend."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!!! This was my first Brazilian Steakhouse experience and I'm definitely coming back. Love how it was an upscale restaurant but families were casually dressed so it gives you a relaxing feeling. Great salad/antipasta bar. Love the cheese selection especially the fresh mozzarella. I went back for more smoked salmon after my dinner. I was told there was 19 different types of meat options and I think i tried 15 (an amazing accomplishment in my book)! Dont think for the main course you only get a ish-load of meat. There's sides of mash potatoes, fried bananas and freid polenta served family style. I just loved their cheese puff/dinner rolls. Not overwhelmingly cheesey with enough dough to make it a dinner roll.   Check out thier extensive wine list. Best way to enjoy a steak dinner is with a great glass of wine. I split a half bottle with a friend :)  Reservations for dinner highly recommneded"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've come here 3 times this month and enjoy it so much. The servers are great and so is the food. I recommend this place to anyone. Eric and Fabi are the best servers we've encounter out of the 10+ times we come here!"}
{"text":"Today, I am giving Fogo de Chao the honor of being my 100th Yelp Elite review.  I ate here on Aug 31, 2017 for the very first time, for summer price of $45 instead of the $52, including prime cuts: lamb chops, filet mignon, ribeye, and beef ribs.  We were a group of 9 Wild Dining MeetUp Foodies.  The moment I put in my mouth, the lamb chops, ribeye, and filet mignon, my eyes rolled back into my head, in that \"to die for\" moment, that I KNEW WAS EXPERIENCING THE SAME \"HEAVEN\" THAT OTHER YELPERS DESCRIBED.  The meats were cooked very very RED, which is very hard for other restaurants to GET RIGHT(for ME) when I order \"rare or medium rare\" at other restaurants.  But here at Fogo, I can look at the color and pick where I want him to cut.  They KNOW how to cook these prime cuts, to me, savored only when very red/rare for most of the inside of their red meats.  To cook such premium meats medium and well-done is to me \"the poor cow gave us his life only to be vulcanized\".    ONLY here can I have all three expensive cuts of lamb chops, ribeye, filet mignon ALL on the SAME plate, at the same time!  How cool is that?    Yet, some of the other meats such as bacon-wrapped beef cubes, pork ribs, were as some disappointed Yelpers described, dry and over-cooked, leaving parts even unedible cos it is too hard (like plastic) to eat.   But not necessarily every time, maybe next time they come to the table with same item, that batch may not be not cooked as dry.  I only tasted 4-5 items at the Market Table salad bar, as I came for the premium meats.  But the marinated mushrooms, green beans (sweet and tender with no strings), hearts of palm, and smoked salmon with capers were ALL SOOO GOOD.  However I only ate those at the end of my dinner and I was alone, after everyone at my table.    When I got home, I realized I do not recall tasting the beef ribs, which employee Danielle, said was her favorite Fogo meat.  Next day I called the restaurant and was told by the manager, that you have to ASK for the beef ribs.  They do not bring the ribs to each table like the other meats, because they make very few, maybe only 15 ribs, because it takes 5 hours and they take up too much room on the grill, so other meats cannot be prepared.    The service was mostly wonderful.  Fogo seems to have picked the most upbeat and enthusiastic employees, like Danielle and Kaylee.  I do have one complaint about the service that makes me almost want to give 4 stars to this Yelp review.  Nine of us sat at a long table at the far rear of the restaurant, meaning 4 of us had our backs to the wall with enough space for someone to walk behind us.  ALL of us had our discs turned up to green, the entire time we dined there because our host said if we didn't, they would not even approach our table.  But SEVERAL of the meat servers only asked the people sitting across from me with their backs to the center of the dining room, what they wanted and cut for them.  But they did not ask the 4 of us with our backs to the wall, instead they quickly went away as if we did not exist before I could say \"Hey how about US?\"  It was almost as if \"they RAN away\".  Yet there was room for them to come behind us and ask each of us who had our backs to the back wall.  After a few times of them \"running away\" after serving the 5 across the table from me, I said to my neighbor, \"Hey they didn't even ask US and ran away.\"  She said, \"I am noticing the same behavior\".    So the next day, when the manager told me about why I did not see the beef ribs, I told him about them \"running away\".    He said that next time I come in, he would put us at a \"better table, more toward the center\".  I also said I was not the host at this dinner, another person was, and he waited for me and others at the front door, and showed us where our table was, and I have no knowledge how that table was \"assigned to us\".  I said that it shouldn't matter where the table is in the dining room, that all diners should be given the same service wherever they sit.  Also people at the same table who had their backs to the center, were served the meat, but people who had their backs to the rear wall, were not.  At least they could ASK us, like they ASKED the people sitting across from US.   He agreed and said that he would address this issue with the servers, and thanked me many times for my \"feedback\".    As I am typing, the \"getting it right with the ribeye, lamp chops, and filet mignon and enough of the other \"heavenly\" foods I ate here and the good service of the other employees, still outweighs this \"running away\" behavior, so I still feel good enough about giving Fogo 5 stars for my 100th review.  Why even the paper towels in the ladies room were \"gourmet\", having seen this type towel only at one other upscale place, the Phoenician Hotel.  I hope that I will not have the \"running away\" in my future visits, where I plan to come for full menu and EAT THE BEEF RIBS for weekday lunch for $35, in the future."}
{"text":"I believe we had reservations here, but had to wait a few minutes still for them to get it ready for us. We had a relatively large group, and were seated in kind of a back area. I was starting to wonder if we were forgotten at some points as we had to ask for several different types of meats to come by to our table. The service was good, but we've had some pretty spectacular service at other steak restaurants and Churrasscos. The food was pretty good. I think some might have been a little more overcooked than I liked but still very flavorful."}
{"text":"Yes, Fogo de Chao is really darn good.   It's a 4.5 star rounded up to 5.   I was there a couple weeks ago with three friends.   We had just finished a long couple of days and wanted to celebrate by having a nice dinner.   We were able to call on a Saturday night at 6:30 and get reservations for 8.   Getting there was no problem.   They have valet parking, but they also have a lot that is wide open.   I'm not sure what that's about but, ok.   We self parked because we figured we'd need to walk a little after dinner.    This is a Brazilian steakhouse.   And every selection of meat they brought out was cooked perfectly.   I can't think of anything that I had that I didn't like.   The salad bar was quite nice and of course that was geared toward the carnivore too.   (How awesome is it when the salad bar has strips of bacon?   You have to love that!)   The service was great.   I had to flip my card from green to red a few times just to catch up.   But I was rewarded with an excellent bacon wrapped fillet Mignon.   Wow... that was good.   If you like meat, you'll love this place.  It's not far from the strip.  One cool thing they had was a mobile bar that would come to your table.  The bartender would mix a drink or pour you a shot.   That was a nice touch.   Will I be back?   You bet, I love beef!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here one time so far. Have to say it will not be the last! The food was awesome, service was awesome! We even had a peak into the kitchen to see how the meat is cooked!! Great place for AUCE Brazilian food!  So many meats to pick from and so good! The salad bar had so many items to pick from, You will not leave here hungry that's for sure!  So worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you are a carnivore, then this place is for you. Julio was the best meat carver! He was extremely attentive, super friendly and goes above and beyond. . The server himself, the one serving the drinks, not so much. Our server was never around, always had to ask a meat carver to send him out. We went 10+ minutes a couple of times without a drink in front of us.  I would give this restaurant 5 stars if the server was better with checking in on us.  Oh and the cocktail prices are comparable to drinking in Manhattan.. Good drinks but be prepared for high prices."}
{"text":"Wtf. We were in the mood for caipirinhas so called ahead to ask if they had Happy Hour today and were told yes, we called twice to confirm. Sat at a bar table for about 10 minutes (absolutely no one else there), then the bartender (with a nasty attitude) literally yells to us from behind the bar if we know what we want!!!! He then brings us our drinks and our bill without even asking is we're going to want anything else. Plus our bill was full price, not happy hour or happy in any way at all. Talk about false advertisement. And what a a-hole. Needless to say we're heading out for appetizers and drinks elsewhere. Never coming to the chain again"}
{"text":"I travelled from Prescott, Az to Las Vegas to take my husband to this restaurant for a romantic dinner. The reviews were stellar and he loves brazillian steakhouses. We had been once before and really liked it. However, this experience was less than stellar. Almost every cut of meat that was served was bland and charred, no matter what rareness we requested. Little to no flavor. The meat was also tough and hard to chew, not tender and great as it should have been for a restaurant that specializes in meat.  The chicken was so dry that it crumbled under my fork. We tried every meat that came by, and I can honestly say that out of 8 meats, we only enjoyed one or two. The service was great though, the waiters were very attentive, quick to refill drinks and very friendly. Kudos to the staff. The biggest problem here besides quality, was price. I don't mind spending good money on great food, the kind of meal you remember for a long time. What I don't care for is spending almost $200 on charred, bland, mediocre food. This visit really disappointed."}
{"text":"My friends and I took my boyfriend here for his 20th birthday. We had a table of 5 and none of us had ever been to Fogo or any other Churrascaria before. I booked a reservation here because it has the best reputation among them in town.  -Let me say I am employed at a high end steak house on the strip so my attention to atmosphere and detail is high, yet understanding.  Upon arrival the complimentary valet and door service is appreciated. The Hostess could have been a bit friendlier however. There were two of them and I feel like my group wasn't there top priority. Maybe because we are a younger group but still, you shouldn't not take us as seriously as other guests. After our whole group arrived we were brought to our table which was set for 6 although the reservation was for 5 and it was a tad awkward when asked if our other guest would arrive, but an easy enough fix.  Our server came over and she asked for our drink orders. I usually remember names but unfortunately I cannot remember hers. One in our group had to leave a bit earlier than the rest so she just ordered cocktails which was thankfully allowed. 3 of us ordered the Brasilian limeade which was very good and the free refills were appreciated. The cheese bread and chimichurri sauce was okay.   I had looked online at the website and here on Yelp to understand how service at a Churrascaria worked. We understood the gist of it, I don't think our server made it clear to us however. Could we ask for certain sides? And as meat goes... I really wanted certain cuts but it never came out when I asked our server. She didn't mention about there being a selection of shrimp and Chilean Sea Bass either! Which we really wanted to try after we were done eating.  In review photos I saw giant lamb shanks but when the men bringing them out... finally after a while of asking.. They were tiny small pieces. Not to say they weren't great tasting but we wanted more. I wish it was easier to have gotten exactly the meats we wanted throughout service. Because we didn't exactly get those specifics.  I do applaud the chefs however. Everything we had bites of from the market table to the ribeye and Especially the Lamb was absolutely delicious.  After we finished eating our plates were cleared. My group was curious to why their was not dessert included in the $51 price tag. Even something small like cookies would have sufficed.  The complimentary dessert brought out for my boyfriends birthday was much appreciated! It was a beautiful vanilla bean crème brûlée and we all thought it was scrumptious. Plus it made him smile.  Overall the food was absolutely great but our first experience could have been a couple notches better. We'd really had liked to try the seafood and more lamb.  I had one more disappointed before we left. I noticed a complimentary drink mix that we had never even heard about from our server. On the way out a manager informed us of it. But I still didn't get to try it even though I asked..  That's all."}
{"text":"We just had a fantastic meal at this new Fogo location. Market bar (salad bar) was delicious and everyone enjoyed the traveling meat. Absolutely no complaints. We highly recommend the signature cocktail and our waiter, Bill. Bill rocks and made our night. What a great addition to downtown summerlin."}
{"text":"So I've been to Fogo de Chao twice in my lifetime. First time was at the homeland of Sao Paolo, Brazil. I wasn't impressed then, as all the meats were overly seasoned and way too salty.  The fogo de chao in Las Vegas was better--not super salty and just enough seasoning. I carpe diem'ed on their \"summer feast\" special,  and since it included my favorite meat, the piccanha, I didn't care that it excluded a few items.   Everything was good, but this place was much smaller than I had anticipated. Most Brazilian churrasco's I've been to have been much larger with a lot more areas for food. This place is smaller than Texas De Brazil, with fewer options.  And, the Pao de Queijo was SQUARE! Man!!! They gotta stay that cute round shape ya know? It kinda ruined my experience a bit, but the flavor was there so I was semi-content.   Will I be back? I think the one visit was enough for me. I'll need to head back to Texas de Brazil one more time to compare.  The summer feast came with a dessert. The tres leches and the chocolate cake were both mehhhhhh. I'd skip these next time."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, great staff, great food, and  wonderful experience all around. The meat cuts on a skewer with a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place. My first time at Fogo de Chao, and I for sure will come back here instead of Texas De Brazil."}
{"text":"I dont know, I just wasn't impressed. It is an ungodly amount of food. You turn a card over to green when you want meat and these guys come by and slice a little, tiny sliver of all kinds of meat. I tried the parmesan pork, bacon wrapped filet, sirloin, pork ribs, beef ribs, chicken and lamb. There's a great salad bar you can go to that has a ton of things on it as well. They bring out a side of mashed potatoes but ours were cold. There were bananas in a cinnamon type sauce, rolls and a cornbread type of thing as well. There were 14 of us and 1 guy (Christopher) told the other side of the table what the deal was but he didnt come to our side so we were just unaware of how things worked. Adam was basically our server and was super efficient and fun. It was my moms 70th bday and he brought her cheesecake and it was delicious. My sister was at the other end of the table and a guy came by and said he was the customer service manager and asked how everything was. She told him that our table was totally out of sync. While we were on dessert, they were just getting some meat so he comped 2 desserts and that was nice. There were so many people constantly at our table, which is great except that there wasn't anyone in control of the table so when my niece asked for more rolls, someone said yes and never came back. That type of thing happened a lot.  Overall, the food was good and our server Adam was cool but the table as a whole had completely different experiences."}
{"text":"Went here for out anniversary a little disappointed this time. I found this in my salad hard as a rock. I asked what it may be and they said oh it's probably a bone and walked away! She said the manager was going to come but never did. We didn't get our sides until we were done eating. The ribs we received were beyond dry not even edible. We also waited 20 minutes for the waiter to come back after giving us the dessert menu. The meat people were very rushed and not polite. No one said goodbye to us when we left. First time at this location. Worst experience... so sad because I really liked this restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been to about 5 different locations, first time at the Vegas spot. It was just as perfect as the others. We were a group of 13 for my friends bachelor party. I made reservations well in advance, and they promptly seated us and several waiters gave a greeting to the bachelor. Everyone had a blast and enjoyed their meal. No better choice for a group of dudes to throw down."}
{"text":"I prefer Texas de Brazil. Cuts of meat were lower quality, fatty & grisly. The same three meats were brought around. Service was slow.  We had to talk to another server to get our server to refill drinks."}
{"text":"Oh yes, baby! That's top quality brazilian food. It smells like home, it feels like home and it TASTES like home (sigh) *-* We were there on my wedding day, party of 10 for lunch. Food was delicious, all our waiters spoke portuguese and they were fun and professional. The service was flawless, they even wrote congratulations on my desert. I think I can speak for everyone, we were very satisfied with the whole experience.  Caipirinha is strong the way it should be. Meat cooked to perfection, plenty of choices on the buffet. Waiters actually DO respect your red sign up. Bathrooms were nice and clean - and I think that's all you need to know! Worth every penny, when in Vegas, be sure to stop by this place!"}
{"text":"Another marvelous time at FoGo De Chao... Splendid service and workers. Lou and Christopher in particular, took awesome care of us there today celebrating Sophia's Bday!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my graduation lunch. Had a great experience! Service was great, atmosphere was casual (but not too casual) and very close to UNLV and the strip. Place is great for a small gathering or a large group. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambiance. The restaurant was clean and n8cely decorated. The 'salad bar' had a very good selection of fresh  vegetables, salads, cheeses and som.e cured meat too. I can't wait for the Canadian locations to open. Our only complaint is we ate too much but had a nice walk back to our hotel to burn it off."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best, doesn't get any better.  Salad bar is wonderful but you need to save as much room for the rest that you can.  Forget death by chocolate this is death by meat haven't found anything that isn't worth the visit.  The green light is on..."}
{"text":"Tried Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse recently since I was in the mood for some steak.  Like most Brazilian Steakhouses (Churrascaria) it is an \"all you can eat\" type arrangement and best to make sure you are very hungry to get your money's worth.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of having a heavy lunch so I was not hungry enough to try everything they had to offer for dinner.  But what I did try was fabulous especially if you enjoy your meat cooked with minimal seasoning or sauces.  Unlike some Churrascaria's I have been to, the salad bar was actually very lite and refreshing and did not fill you up quickly. Others I have been to only offer heavy creamy dressings and other heavy items to fill you up quickly so that you only eat a small portion of meat.  Additionally the ambiance was excellent as well as the service by the staff.  The house muscat and cabernet wines were also excellent.  Desert was likewise excellent, just keep in mind that certain items such as the creme brulee are upgrade items and are not included in the flat rate for the meal but was well worth the extra cost.  Overall this was a great dining experience and looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"This place is...weird. With such hefty prices, I was expecting something a little more elegant. It feels a bit like dining aboard a Carnival Cruise ship. There's this huge salad bar buffet with people loading up their plates and stuffing their faces with too much food. The lights are very bright at dinnertime and the tables are lined up tightly together all in a row.   But the food is very good. The unlimited gluten-free cheesy dinner rolls taste like popovers. I kept asking if they were really gluten-free because they tasted so good!  The meats carved up tableside were all delicious and the servers were friendly, if hurried.   In all, I recommend this place if you're looking for a different dining experience every once in a long while but a relaxed dining experience it is not."}
{"text":"So, I really, really love Fogo de Chao, but I was disappointed with this location.  I've gone to Fogo in Dallas and Kansas City for years, and each time, the food is amazing, the service is impeccable, and the restaurant is beautiful. We always have a wonderful experience and feel that it's well worth the money.  The Scottsdale location... no. It's large, and the restaurant is nice, but the service is not good. The gauchos regularly came to our table and were attentive, but our dirty plates were not cleared until as asked, our sides of fried polenta, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas became cold/empty and were not replaced until we asked, and our cheese bread also ran out and was not replaced until we asked.  Usually, sides and bread are replaced quickly, whether they're cold or empty, and several people will ask how we're doing and if we need anything. That didn't happen here. After we were done eating, we sat for a good 10+ minutes waiting for the table to be cleared so we could get dessert despite several servers walking by.  I just wasn't impressed. It was not the good experience I've come to love. I will happily go to other Fogo locations but I think I'm done with Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This restaurant is contemporary but welcoming.  The staff here are exceptional and do their best to ensure a truly nice dining experience. Make sure to make a reservation.  The traditional caparhina cocktail is an excellent choice if you like fresh lime and a Margarita on the rocks flavor.  The \"salad\" bar offers many choices of meats and cheeses along with other delicacies like garlic mushrooms, smoked salmon and olives.  The meat choices are varied and include beef ribs with meat sliced from the bone.  The very attentive staff will call over any of the gaucho servers with a cut of meat you'd like.  Filet, parmesan crusted pork loin, ribeye to name a few.  For dessert there is an extensive menu that includes grilled sugar crusted pineapple and creme brule."}
{"text":"\"....they need more meats on a stick...\" - Ben Stiller as Ted in There's Something About Mary.  I think he meant they need more gauchos running around in a restaurant slicing it up for me to indulge in.    I brought a friend here for dinner.  He had never had the churrascaria experience so I thought I would help him improve his dining experience exponentially.  The first great thing, apart from the food, was the parking set up.  There's complimentary valet parking OR your friend can park a 100 yds away from the front door so he can laugh at you while you negotiate beds of tiny rocks in your stilettos.  Anyway, this location is soooo much better than the Beverly Hills one that has super atrocious parking.  To the good stuff....I made my friend order a caipirinah and I ordered a Mondavi Pinot Noir to start.  We hit the salad bar and my friend was like what is all this weird stuff.  Who cares, just dump ranch on it!  They had a really yummy apple salad that I had never tried before, but I like to load up on the hearts of palm, artichokes, and buffalo mozzarella.  Along with never having had the Brazilian experience, my friend had never had filet mignon....smh...you poor sheltered thing.  He tried the bacon wrapped filet & chicken first.  I watched him de-virginize his mouth with filet mignon.  It was pornographic.  Then we tried MY personal fave, lamb chops medium rare.  I also had the bottom sirloin which was a little too skirty for my liking.  Oh, this kid also tried his first bite of polenta....christ almighty...and he liked.  We finished off dinner with the papaya cream dessert, which was papaya blended w/ vanilla ice cream topped w/ creme de cassis, and 2 snifters of B & B.  Oh, you've never had B & B?  Kiss the enamel on your teeth goodbye, but it tastes absolutely delish!  We had phenomenal service at a great price.  I got more bang for my buck here at this location.  What I spent here on the AYCA, dessert, & booze was equal to the cost of the AYCE only price at the BH locale.  (What's the exchange rate of the Cali $ to the AZ $....3 to 1?  I love it!)  For a casual yet buzzing dining experience, bring your self-proclaimed sheltered friends here for a meaty, treaty taste fest, flip to green and it's on!"}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place!  The salad bar is oh so good!!  The house special is my favorite meat!  The papaya cream aids in digestion and is definitely a must by dessert time!!   If you like jalapeños be sure to ask for the chiles toreados!!  The chimichuri is one of my favorites.  Service is impeccable!!"}
{"text":"Our party of 8 went there for dinner and had a fabulous time.  We had been to other Brazilian Steakhouses, but this one's meat just tasted better.  Service was impeccable as well.  Overall, a very good dining experience."}
{"text":"From previous reviews sounds like I should've skipped the salty, overwhelming meat selection and boring salad bar and went straight for the CAKE but I didn't and I suffered.  Next meal, I'M picking the restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Had a good salad bar selection, but i think the Beverly hills location has a better salad bar. My favorite meat is the picanah."}
{"text":"Meat! Meat! Meat!   And I am not talking about the male review! My favorite steak restaurant by far.  I see from the reviews most feel the same as I do, however, there are a few people out there that seem to not realize that when you roast a steak the size of a small roast, i.e., 2+ pounds it will be more reminiscent of a prime rib, where extremely flavorful on the exterior and tender but less flavorful in the center. No problem! They have a million was to dress it up. Everything from A-1 to chimichurri, but that is not to say that the meat is bland. IT IS FAR from bland! And don't get me started on the Brazilian cheese bread, or the most sophisticated salad bar I have ever seen! The gauchos remember you and treat you like family!"}
{"text":"Fogo lunch!  This is how you treat yourself. Market table buffet 15$ with many salads, cheeses, charcuterie, rice and fejodja bar. You can also get endless cuts of any specific meat for 6-9$. Or opt for the full experience for 34$."}
{"text":"For my husband's birthday we decided to try this place out, since we're fans of Texas de Brazil.  Well, don't worry about losing us, TdB, because we were entirely unimpressed. Most of the reviews here mention the wonderful service; I feel like we must have been in another universe entirely.  We arrived early and were seated promptly, but that was about it for the service perks.  We had HORRIBLE service, especially from the meat-bearing men (you know what I mean).  We both had our cards on green, and time and time and time again we were passed by!  It was so bad at one point I even held mine up and waved it in the air (I didn't mean to be so obnoxious but I was seriously annoyed) and STILL no one came by!  We were seated around plenty of other tables and they were served, we even tried calling out to them and got nothing.  The manager came by and we asked for him to send two different types of meat over, he said okay and left.  They NEVER SHOWED UP.  We flagged down another server and asked and finally got them.  Our plates sat empty for the majority of the meal because no one would serve us!  I have never experienced this at TdB or any other restaurant where we paid over $100 for a meal. The meat itself wasn't bad, I really appreciated the menu to see what we hadn't yet tried.  My husband preferred the way the meat is seasoned at TdB, and I will say that I have a different understanding of \"medium rare\" than these chefs do, but to each his own.  The polenta fries were DELICIOUS, but as for the other sides we prefer TdB.  And the salad bar felt lacking, but this could be a personal thing as I do love my lobster bisque and they don't have it.  My husband ordered a cocktail, I passed on a glass of wine because prices starting at $11 seemed unreasonable (and we're locals, I feel like it's hard to surprise us with expensive drinks).  His drink was over $13 but it was tasty (however, it was a smaller sized portion). Finally, as mentioned, it was his birthday.  So we ordered dessert and were served with a lovely chocolate cake with a plate that read, \"HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!\"  We thought this was hilarious, but I was annoyed, I had obviously mentioned it was his birthday when making the reservation.  The manager came over to wish us happy anniversary and we laughed and told him it was my husband's birthday actually, then the manager said, \"Well, did you say anniversary on the phone?\"  Ummm... no, no I didn't, I'm pretty sure I specified birthday. Overall, we were definitely underwhelmed and will not return.  Considering the high prices, abhorrent service, and dishes that are not on par with TdB, it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"**Summary** - Fogo is an authentic Brazilian Steakhouse chain. They bring the meats on skewers and cut it right in front of you. - All the meats were, for the most part, medium to rare. They were super juicy and not too salted. - My must haves would be the Picanhas, filet mignon (Not the one wrapped in bacon), and the beef ribs. - Prices - Lunch and dinner have exactly the same menu! You're saving $20 just for eating earlier. - Doneness - When the server cuts the meat for you, they give you a choice. However, it's usually between rare to medium. Just as a warning or a tip, rare is pretty rare. - By Request - All the meats rotate regularly with the exception of the Beef ribs and the garlic beef. - Decor/Mood - Classy and pampering. **Price** - $26.50 Lunch Mon-Fri 11:30am - 2pm - $46.50 Dinner Mon-Thurs 5pm-10pm & Weekend **Ordered** - Salad bar - The smoked salmon is a must. Other than that, it's just salads. - Costela - Beef ribs. They don't come around unless you ask for them. This is by far my favorite. They ribs have just enough fat in them. - Filet Mignon - There are two types. The huge steak filet was so tender words can't describe. The bacon wrapped one looked dry so I didn't try it. - Picanhas - House special and perfectly seasoned. - Cheese Bread - This place definitely has the cheesiest meltiest in your mouth bread. When they come hot out of the oven, I just want to eat it plain. - Beef Ancho/Alcatra/Fraldinha - Rib-eye/Top Sirloin/Bottom Sirloin. Cooked perfect and nice and juicy - Cordeiro - Rack of lamb. Pretty good, but I'd avoid it next time in place of better meats. - Costela de Porco - Pork Ribs. They were a bit dry and I'd stick to the beef ribs. - Lombo/Frango/Linguica - Pork Loin/Chicken/Sausage. Didn't really try it. - Garlic Beef - Didn't get a chance to try it. You have to request it. I found out too late. **Comparing** - If you've been to the other steak houses in town, here's a comparison section. - Texas de Brazil - Texas is saltier, the salad bars are about the same. The meats are dryer at Texas. - Via Brasil - Saltiness is about the same, the salad bar at Via has more hot foods and is more extensive. The meats are juicy, but Fogo has cuts that are more rare than Via. - Sides - Via Brazil has the most choices and better fried banana. Texas and Fogo have a limited selection. However, Fogo has the best cheese bread. - For lunch, nothing beats $26.50. It's hands down Fogo. - For dinner, it depends. If you like your meats rarer, I'd say Fogo. If you like your meats more medium-rare to medium, it's a coin flip. **Recommendations** - I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a nice treat for a special occasion or in the mood for a ton of perfectly cooked and savory meats."}
{"text":"Much better than the Downtown LA location. The entire staff was friendly and made our date night easy and fun. One waiter (I am bad with names so I apologize) from Chicago was super cool. We had a whole conversation about the Earthquakes in Mexico and the Hurricanes which seem to be everywhere. Only thing I didn't enjoy was how pushy one of the waitresses was about add ons at the end of our meal. I think I should only have to say no thank you once when asked for after dinner drinks or desserts. Besides that part of the meal, we had a great experience, good food, and the drinks were good... Too good actually. Lol"}
{"text":"The service, the food spread at the bar and the meats were all deserving of a round of applause. This elegantly decorated restaurant offers top notch food, service and smiles.   This was our first time here and it more than exceeded my expectations.  Thank goodness for Yelp, we got a great discount during the summer and got $23 knocked off our bill.  This is a not a cheap meal, but it was worth every penny, even at full price.    The salad bar with fresh cheeses, thinly sliced meats and more variety than I can ask for.  Get ready for a protein overload.  You want to savor every bite and some of the meats were salty, but that's why the vegetables at the self serve bar would go so well together.    I didn't take note of any of the meat names, because it was all coming too fast. The lamb, steak, and pork are served from different but excellent cuts of meat.  The spices allowed us to distinct one from another when we asked for more.  We savored our meal and didn't pig out too much.  My only complaint was they kept refilling and pushing those plantains on us even though we didn't eat the first plate.  I thought it was a waste of food, as trays and trays of them came out and they kept convincing us to take it.  Needless to say, we even skipped dessert and I wish we would have tried something sweet from the menu."}
{"text":"Stunningly chic Brazilian BBQ buffet. Excellent salad bar which offered fresh sides to accompany the juicy meats served tableside sizzling hot & right off the fire. Can't beat the concept & classy delivery of a very delicious smorgasbord of lamb, beef, pork, & chicken. Oh, and the basket of cheese puffs were to die for!! To top it off, they also offer creative Brazilian cocktails & some of the best wines for a pretty decent price. And, I can't fail to mention...the Brazilian pit masters who were serving us were the creme on top! What else can a girl ask for?! Best looking Brazilian meat anywhere! Lol!"}
{"text":"After my first visit the other night this is now my GO TO place for steak. I love the concept of sampling various cuts of meat at the same meal. The meats are really prepared with great flavors. My favorites were the filet mignon, the lamb, and the ribeye. The salad bar was stocked with great cheeses, peppers, salamis, and other tasteful goodies. It was our 30th wedding anniversary and we chose the right place to go. The staff were absolutely the best. If you haven't tried it yet this is a MUST DO for everyone."}
{"text":"There's something to be said when I don't have The Hunger for the rest of the day...   Restaurant Week (RW) always seems to lure me to the places I would never go on any ordinary day, even though we did go on a Thursday.   Salad bar with more selections I could remember, however I did have some lime-dressed-scallions/greens/tomatoes/something that blended well with the meats.  Notably, the smoked salmon was a bit too salty for my liking.   My favorite of the meats would be the parmesean pork and the lamb. I was never really a big fan of lamb, but this was soft and tender.   Water was never empty, service was top notch and I will have to remind myself to fast for a few days before coming here again :)"}
{"text":"Good food.   Garlic filet was nice.  Our waiter was a little pushy.  Caiparranias were excellent."}
{"text":"I came to Fogo de Chao for AZ Restaurant Week in 2010.  The first disclaimer is that you have to be a serious meat eater if you want to enjoy all the benefits.  I do not eat beef as a Hindu, but I was actually able to enjoy quite a bit of the experience.  I got an opportunity to eat really good BBQ Chicken, sausage, a hybrid chicken-pork dish, and several seafood items from the buffet tray.    Fogo de Chao is very similar to tradition Brazilian BBQ.  I have actually been to a Brazilian BBQ in Rio, so I know this was very authentic.  You start off at the salad bar which has other small items such as cheese, seafood, and fruit.  You have quite a wide array of seafood to enjoy for non-red meat eaters.  You then sit down in your table and you get a button.  Green means bring it on!  Red means, stop for now or game over!  If you have your button turned to green, you will get constantly questioned about food.  I made this mistake in Brazil, and I had everyone and their mom come to my table asking if I wanted food.  I was so into the food, I didn't realize this simple little rule.  Once you want to call it quits for good, you get a selection of a few desert items.  I think Fogo de Chao does a good job replicating the traditional Brazilian BBQ.  The quality of food is very similar from what my red-meat eating friends tell me.  This is a good taste of Brazilian BBQ if you do not want to travel all the way to Brazil."}
{"text":"Loved the food it was all amazing! I would recommend to anyone. Great place for a date, the meat was to die for! I enjoyed my date there and I cant wait to go back. Also the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"More than five stars. Excellent service, excellent salads, and (outside of my Uruguayan dad's half-day-charcoal-slow-smoked asado with home made chimmichurri) this is hands down the BEST MEAT IVE EVER TASTED. If you love meat come here. If you like quick, efficient service, also come. Note - for the past few years we've not been regular red meat eaters but we kind of went overboard at this restaurant cos of their meat so we felt super full for a good few days after our visit."}
{"text":"thank you very much guys! Was great lunch. Next time i promess to eat more hehehe!! Thanks again to take care of my daughter and i."}
{"text":"This place was sooo good! Excellent variety at the buffet and the meats were outstanding. The table service was also outstanding. There was always someone there to make sure we had what we needed. I liked it better than Texas De Brazil."}
{"text":"The staff here is excellent.    If there is anything you want you just have to ask.  Drew is awesome!!  He went way above and beyond to take care of us."}
{"text":"My guy and I usually choose a different restaurant every Saturday for our 'date night'. This is one of the few restaurants we have revisited! This was actually our third time here. The staff was amazing and the food was even better.   The lamb chops are the best we have ever had and we have eaten at some of the swankiest restaurants in this town. The staff was so attentive they seemed to read our minds. From the moment we sat down our needs were met. My glass never went dry, we were visited by management to confirm our evening was enjoyable and the food did not disappoint. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'll get to the point. Hostess: didn't look happy and never smiled once and couldn't find my reservation. Service: was seated at the back of the restaurant for a party of 8. took 15 min before we had to flag a server down to explain how we're suppose to start eating and took our drink orders. this really pissed me off, but after we got their attention, everything caught up to speed and we went and got our salads and the meats started coming around fast.  Food: the bread they give you is so so soo delicious, warm, soft, and sweet. their salad bar has a good selection of veggies as cheeses and other yummy sides. the meats were so tender and juicy and very flavorful. I wasn't too big of a fan of the chicken cuts, but the prime rib, lamb, house sirloin, and garlic beef were amazing. if you love meat, this is definitely a place for you. we were there to celebrate two birthdays and the server was very generous and allowed the two birthday girls to pick any dessert on the house AND allowed the other 6 people in the party choose between three different types of dessert, so everyone got a slice of cheesecake which was fluffy and delicious."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to go anytime.. Especially to celebrate birthdays.. We got Derek as our waiter and he is AWESOME!!! They just need guacamole haha jk (inside joke)"}
{"text":"Food is amazing service is better than Ruth Chris"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Fogo de Chao restaurants in Houston, TX and Scottsdale, AZ multiple times. Both were amazing. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding. It is well worth the $40 price even if you do not plan to stuff yourself since it is all you-can-eat. You are paying for the quality, not quantity. There is such a variety of different cuts of steak, as well as pork and chicken. All have their own unique flavor and all are extremely tasty. If you are not a huge meat eater, you can get just the salad bar for half the price. That is also worth the trip in my opinion since it contains many unusual options such as hearts of palm, fresh mozzarella balls, and sun dried tomatoes that are not found in your average salad bar. The side dishes served at the table are also very, very good if you like Latin food. Black beans, crisped polenta cakes, and steamed plantains. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"We were the last customer on the day, and it was very close to the closing time (it was 9 PM, not 10 PM). All the staff were very kind and generous though, and the food was good. There was not much choice at the salad bar, but meat coming endlessly was very good.  If you want to devour some meat someday, I am sure that you will not regret!"}
{"text":"The BEST Churrascaria not just of Las Vegas but of all time over Texas de Brazil by far. We used to go to TDB all the time until a friend recommended us here so we gave it a try and I can't even begin to tell you how much of a difference it is in the meats and the service. Most of all service is 70% of what matters really also the food of course but how they treat you and the experience they give you is the real deal. Dined in with my wife and two other friends and we're right away greeted by our server Min and he was such a gentleman pulling out our wives chairs for them and ours as being seated. First impressions are very important and that alone already wowed us and we knew we were in for a treat. We started out with seafood as an appetizer that was just awesome because we didn't know such a steakhouse would have such a thing but it was a beautiful tower of lobster,crab, shrimp and mussels! Absolutely fantastic, than we moved on to their salad bar which is filled with such bright and tasteful fruits and salads and cheeses. Don't stuff yourself up on the salad now! Always remember why you're there and it's for the main course , the best of all is their steaks. Cut after cut was just pure perfection. The right temperature the right seasoning just perfection. We couldn't figure out why the meats were just so full of flavor as our server Min let us know that the meats are actually cooked from charcoal. Unlike almost every steakhouse now they cook their meats under propane gas, Fogo De Chao does NOT. No wonder why the meats are tender and juicy the way they are served table side and just right off the grill. You can taste the smoke in the meats! All the meat carvers were all great with such big smiles on their faces and always were so accommodating with  getting three different temperatures of meat to our table with no hassle at all. Thumbs up to our server he always made sure we got exactly what we wanted and never had to wait for anything. I love how everyone here does NOT treat you like they have to do what you want or ask for. Phenomenal service from when you first sit down until you walk out their doors. Worth the visit and highly recommended! Will be telling everyone about our wonderful night there."}
{"text":"There are a handful of Brazilian churrascaria restaurants in Las Vegas, and I have tried four of them to date.  After a recent meal at Fogo de Chao, the newest member of Las Vegas' Restaurant Row on E. Flamingo and the latest (possibly the greatest) Brazilian BBQ hot spot to open in Sin City, I am very happy to recommend to all meat lovers living and visiting Las Vegas to make an obligatory pit stop at Fogo de Chao during your stay.  And here are the list of reasons why:  1) The value is unbeatable!  At $44.50 for dinner ($22.50 salad bar only) or the amazing promotional value of just $26.50 during lunch ($19.50 for salad bar only) it will be the best steakhouse meal you can have, without being $7/side to death.  2) The servers are actually the cooks/chefs that prepared the cut of meat they are serving.  They are intimately knowledgeable about the food they serve you, and which part is your desired steak doneness, so you can fully enjoy your food.  3) The salad bar is huge and stocked with top of the line items (giant extra fancy Hearts of Palms, artichoke hearts, a whole wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano!), some you perhaps will not even recognized because it is not typically served on a self-served salad bar.  (The salad bar only option is perfect for those that are not too carnivorous).  Although I will say that the salad bar selections are not as extensive as some others in town, which can be viewed positively (more room for meat!) or negatively (dude, where's the fillers I am used to getting full on at XYZ churrascaria).   4) The wine selection is extensive, and smartly organized in their beautiful display case for speedy access and service.  5) The best chicken (secret is the overnight marinade in brandy, beer and other seasoning) before being rotisserie roasted over hickory fire to perfection.  And this is not even a \"chicken\" place.  6. New Zealand Lamb!  Served as whole roasted Leg of Lamb or Racks of Lamb.  7) All steaks served are Angus beef and wet aged, always fresh and never frozen!  8) Multiple private rooms available (all hooked up with A/V setup) for corporate and special occasions functions.  NO DEPOSITS required, charged per person, and is available on a first come first serve basis.  9) Will offer brunch on special holidays, such as Mother's Day.  10) Service is very attentive, drinks are frequently refilled.  Service for the meats can feel somewhat overwhelming at first, but you can always turn over the GO/STOP card until you want more.   Ambiance:  4.5/5  Very spacious and up scale. Private rooms are stylishly decorated.  Service:  4.5/5  Very friendly and attentive.  If you have any requests, just ask the staff.  Food:  4.5/5  Heaven for BBQ meat and steak lovers.  I can see a lot of lost business opportunities at other steakhouses in Las Vegas, once words spread about Fogo de Chao. Salad bar is respectable for a steakhouse, and everything is essentially top of the line and fresh, without the steakhouse a la carte price!  Price:  4/5  Dinner              5/5 Lunch  Parking:  4/5  There are self parking spots available, as well as complimentary valet parking."}
{"text":"Second time dining here. If you're a meat eater. You will def enjoy this place. I like to take advantage of their salad bar. I'm not much of a steak eater but they have chicken too lol.  It can be pricey but it's worth it.  Customer service is top notch"}
{"text":"Love it!!! Excellent steak, very good Bloody Mary drink, and really good some kind of  Brazilian lemonade.  Nice salad bar, can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food great value great service and it's immediate and great for a family with kids. They weren't too busy but they really went out of there way to ensure every and anything we needed were there.   I would highly recommend also great for groups"}
{"text":"Went to Fogo De Chao for the first time today for my Birthday! Loved everything about this place! The food was delicious and the servers did great! Lou the customer service representative went out of his way to make sure everything was extra special for my birthday including giving me a complementary dessert!  My new favorite restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Pricy but that's expected. Huge restaurant. Endless amounts of AMAZING MEAT! Oh my gosh. I was in heaven. Unfortunately, my stomach couldn't fit more than 2 plates (I'm the worst person to take to a buffet), but I did try every single meat. I'm salivating thinking about the tender...juicy meat...right now.....-zones out-  Service was entertaining and friendy. Our waiter was also able to tell us more about the city and gave us suggestions on nightclubs for our group! He even gave us a card for a promoter at a nightclub we were thinking of hitting up. Always a plus when you get hookups from your waiter!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend liked it!! salad bar they have a lot of selections it is so appetiZing!!! meats 10/10 .. u can do speacial request if you want it cook all the way or medium well however u want it! ill def comin back dim lights inside romantic!!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to go here for a group event really really enjoyed it!  The whole concept of this place is just kind of cool.   If your are a vegetarian this place might not be for you although I am sure the menu could accommodate.  I like the table service-  green=bring me more, red=i'm kind of full for now.  The food was really good and the experience of the place was fun!  The salad bar walk thru needs to be re vamped because it doesn't flow fast enough, at least that was my experience on the evening I was there, possible on a slower evening it would be fine.  Good place to go for a special occasion or with a group.  All in all service was good, food was delicious and I can't wait to have a reason to go back!"}
{"text":"We were eager to try this place for years and finally on a fathers day event, we did it, but what a disappointment!!! From beginning our server was not fully engaged to help us, we felt that it was an inconvenience to ask for anything even a simple chimichuri was like pulling teeth. The food overall was somewhat ok. We didn't even get a chance to see what desserts they offer. Asking to open a bottle of wine was an inconvenience. Our overall experience was poor!!! Texas de Brazil is still the best from the moment you walk in, to dining and upon leaving. Sadly, we're not going back to this place."}
{"text":"I haven't traveled a lot but I have been to 5 different Countries.. I can honestly say this was one of the BEST meal that I ever had!  It was the sum of all of its parts. The food, the atmosphere, and the service were all excellent! Lou was the manager on staff that evening and he, along with our server Norma were very attentive and it felt genuine.  I left very full and satisfied. Best Birthday meal ever, I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"A little off the Strip but a good location on Flamingo's restaurant row.  Service is fast and furious if you forget to flip your card to red, the meat keeps on coming, LOL. I have to call the attention of the wait staff for help in cleaning our dirty plates.  I love the Filet Mignon, the Rib Eye and the Pork Ribs.  Nice selection of wine. Now the not so good: Salad bar can need a little improvement specially the Greens, they are soggy cause they already mixed the dressing. The fruit selection are of inferior in quality and taste and they need a little variety of bread. The plantain they put on our table were like mashed potato cause it was overripe but the polenta and the cheese bread were good. If you love meat you will like this place."}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome hostess, servers and everything!  90% of the time, the meat comes out piping hot, which are all delicious. Their signature meat, picanha is extremely delicious. I probably get 9-12 slices of this fatty, crispy and well-marinated cut every time I go. Tip: Get 1-2 slices at a time and get your second (or third) servings when they come around again. Meat gets cold quick and these delicate cuts are best when served hot.  My partner and I celebrated our anniversary here and the team did everything to make it an extremely pleasant and awesome memory. From the moment we sat down, we were quickly greeted and congratulated about our special day. Service was super responsive and they took care of everything from replacing our appetizers to refilling our drinks in a timely manner. At the end of our meal, we even got a delicious dessert complimentary of the team at the restaurant. Talk about great service!   The salad bar is also well-maintained. Nothing too special or crazy about it - just make sure not to get full off of it!   Overall, I'd highly reccomend this place for anyone interested in trying out Brazilian BBQ! It's an awesome way to dine and it's pretty fun! It's on the pricey side, which shouldn't surprise you about Fogo De Chao (or Brazilian BBQ) for that matter. I heard lunch is a bit more affordable if you're on a budget.   Come here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Nov. 24, 2016 This was the most amazing all you can eat meat experience ever. A carnivores delight. There is lots of different cuts of meats to sample. Pork, Chicken, Beef and Lamb. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. I love the fact that you can have it from rare to well done. They give you a card that is red on one side and green on the other side. Red means no more meat for now and green means show me the meat.  What I recommend is to ask for a small piece of meat because there is so many to pick from and you want to be able to taste all of them.  I would leave my card on red but when someone with a meat skewer I did ask what it was and ask for a small slice.  I really did not eat from the salad bar, but I'd did look very good. I did eat plenty of the Brown sugar and black pepper bacon because it was so crispy and amazing and who doesn't like bacon. The Pao de Queijo is a warm, soft cheesy bread roll that is so yummy. Of course I did leave room for coffee and Creame Brûlée that melts in your mouth.  Again come here with a big appetite and enjoy the amazing food and warm friendly staff. And no you can not take your leftovers home. They get 5 stars for great food and great service."}
{"text":"Really nice place. I will definitely come back and recommend this place. The servers we're so attentive and were always asking if we needed more drinks or anything else. It was so nice to see such hands on waiters. Salad bar was nice. My husband and I along with our kids had a memorable expirience. We drove an hr just to check it out. I'll be driving back!"}
{"text":"Fogo is unlike any Brazilian Steakhouse I've been to before. They are more upscale and service is the key to their success. My fella requested we come here for his birthday dinner this year. We arrived and were greeted warmly by the hostess. We were taken to our seats and were attentively checked on by all the waiters and gauchos regularly from that point on.   Our waiter explained their ordering process and brought us our drinks. We started with the salad bar. We were careful not to fill up too much on all the delectables there, saving room for the mountain of meat to follow. Then it was time to flip our cards from red to green and prepare for the onslaught. All the cuts we tried were excellent. My favorites were the lamb chops, flank steak and the Picanha. There were a few cuts that were a little overcooked for my taste, but overall the food was fantastic. The cheesy bread was subtle and fantastic and I have to say that I loved the salad bar. I'd probably have no qualms coming back just to indulge in the salad bar while my fella protein-loaded until his heart's content. At the end of our meal, the restaurant manager came by to talk to us and make sure we enjoyed our meal. He even sent over some complementary flan for my fella's birthday. the flan was excellent. The service was perfection and the experience was exactly what I had hoped for. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for their salad bar lunch and skipped the meat, a travesty I know.  This Fogo De Chao just recently opened in Downtown Summerlin and the service was impeccable. The restaurant was empty so all the servers were extra attentive with refills on drinks, bread, sides and clearing plates.   The salad bar was well stocked but they lacked any soup options, which would have been nice to enjoy as well."}
{"text":"If you want the meat to keep coming all night, then this is the place for you ;)  I couldn't handle it all, I ended up taking a bite of everything so I could try it all, but ended up wasting a lot of meat.  The cheese rolls are to die for."}
{"text":"Usually don't give 5 start on first visit. I am because I am already planning another visit.  I have wanted to dine at this restaurant for sometime, I am in Peoria and they are in Scottsdale. My daughter gave us a gift card for Christmas, no more excuses. There was a party of 7. On arrival for a 5:30 reservation we were promptly seated. Our waiter Derek went over the set up for the ones that had not eaten at a Fogo before. Through our stay Dered made sure we were well taken care of thought out the meal. I would definitely give Derek a thumbs ups.  About the food. You can start with the salad bar which is stocked with all the salad makings plus cheeses and bacon. Not the crumbled kind that nay or may not of been bacon but actual strips of bacon, crush it up for your salad or just eat the strip along with the salad.  Me I am on a protein diet and I waited at the table with the green side of my chip up. You get a chip with a green side which says I am ready for meat or a red side when you are resting between pieces of meat. The meat was excellent, every piece was well prepared. There was also at least 4 types of breads, fried bananas and mashed potatoes served with the meal.  I will be back.  Oh, and Thanks Derek for watching over us."}
{"text":"I went to heaven and came back with a new gospel. The gospel of meat. Fogo De Chao allows you to forget all your problems. Those taxes, those unfinished roads, and asbestos in some schools all becomes a far off memory when you are here.  Right when you enter you are greeted by peeps who act like they got a degree from a four year university on etiquette and service. You'll be sat down and have your drink order taken (per usual) and then the dining begins.  PRO TIP: Don't eat a lot of the salad bar - the main attraction is the meat. I never realized that meat could be served in such large portions. Shish kabobs were my only foray into this type of fine dining, but Fogo showed me I was an amateur with every bite!  The rounds are unlimited as long as you can keep flipping that card and have room in that tummy to spare. It was a hefty price tag at the end, but some things in life are worth it, and a trip to Fogo De Chao is one of them."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience and meats and meats and meats!!! Went with a party of 16 for a birthday party and the staff was very attentive and kept bring the neat and explaining everything.  Very friendly and engage able staff. Meat is cooked to whatever you want. A bit on the pricey side. It's not your every weekend place, but for special occasions it is worth it  Call ahead for large groups."}
{"text":"Brazilian Steakhouse - what does that mean, great food with a multitude of flavors. It also means that they bring out their meats on skewers and carve to your liking.  There is a salad bar available, my suggestion is to get the salad and sides because when you start the meat portion you will need to mix it up a little.   Turn your card to the green position and let the meat induced coma begin, my personal favorite is the bacon wrapped filet and garlic sirloin. The lamb chops are also a keeper. Keep track of what you get because it will start to look the same.  Would suggest on the first visit to try all the meats to see which one you enjoy. Don't eat everything but conserve your appetite so you can try as many things as you can."}
{"text":"This is the best Brazilian place I have been to. I have been to one in Toronto, and this out succeeds by far. Go for lunch as it is the same menu. Seems many famous people eat here. Service is unbelievable, they ask how you like your meat, and then seem to have most cuts at that doneness. Wish they would bring an outlet to Toronto, as the similar places are not the same quality. Go here, and don't go to the casino buffets!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service!!   My boyfriend and I thought coming in on a Saturday night without a reservation would be a problem, but it wasn't at all! We we're seated immediately.   Food at the buffet table was generous and lots of variety. The meats were cooked to perfection and really tasty. The staff was great - from the front area host to the servers and up to the managers. Christian was one of our waiters and he AMAZING.   He suggested this sauce to pair with the meat and he was spot on with that suggestion.  All in all, my boyfriend and I were delighted with the restaurant. And we will be going back!"}
{"text":"We came here for a celebration and reserved a private room for a party of 12. The restaurant is very well decorated and our private room was extremely elegant, clean and welcoming. We started out our meal with all you can eat salad bar, followed by unlimited choices of meats that came around our table during the entire dinner. We all finished up our meal with delicious dessert that we all shared. All of our guests left this place extremely satisfied and happy at the end of the night. Since majority of our guests did not go to the salad bar, they even removed some costs (we did not ask for it by the way) and did not add the 20% gratuity on our final bill. Due to the excellent customer service and how happy we were with this place, we ended up tipping them 30% instead.   If you have a huge get together and most of your guests are meat lovers, I highly recommend this place. They do require your credit card number and fill out two pages form for a large party reservation. However, they will not charge you unless there is a no show. Adults are approximately $55 per person and children are half price."}
{"text":"One of the best food and service I have ever had! Definitely is a place to visit while in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Tasty food.  I like it for lunch because later, I can skip dinner.  Their salad bar satisfies the vegetarian taste buds.  I like this place alot.  I think it lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Went there tonight.  Was seated on time, and everything started out ok.  When we were done with the salad, we were inundated with meats.  However, after that, further meat was impossible to get.  Specifically over a period of 30 minutes, I asked three different people for filet, with no luck.  Finally I asked our waiter, who complained that they were understaffed, and also said we should have just asked him.  However, we never saw him during that 30 minute period.  To top it off, he added gratuity to our check, for a party of 6.  For $50, I would expect much better service."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering thinking about this place (I shouldn't write reviews when I'm hungry). 15 different sorts of meat, unlimited salad bar, yummy warm cheesy bread, and authentic Brazilian caipirinha = yum.   I came here for date night and had a great time. Our server was really friendly and explained how the the steakhouse worked as far as meats and the salad bar. Each of the meat servers is actually a gaucho chef. I think our server said there were 18 of them. That means each of the gentlemen bringing you meat and carving it for you is actually the person preparing it as well. That was impressive and nice to know.   As far as the food, some of the meats were hit or miss for me.  The sausage was just meh, the bottom sirloin was a bit salty, but the picanha, alcatra, and parmesan crusted pork loin were so delicious.  Most of the meats were juicy but had a perfect fire roasted char on the outside. YUM.  I know they have several areas they can convert to private rooms for functions or larger groups.  I talked to the service manager and he let me know there's no fee to rent a room and they can even split everyone's check individually in a party.  I'm definitely thinking about doing my graduation party here with my family and friends!"}
{"text":"While attending CES, I was in the mood for BBQ. I had tried the Niagara Falls & Philadelphia locations of this restaurant. So, I decided to check it out. This restaurant was right next to McCormick and Schmick Steakhouse but compared to that restaurant, it was packed. I went there lunch time. The food was exquisite. The meats, as always, were cooked to perfection. The salad bar has many tempting items but don't fill up on those because BBQ is the main attraction of this place. As long as you show your \"green\" card on your table the waiters will keep bringing you BBQ meats at your table. My favourites include Lamb Chops, Fillet Minion, and Rib Eye. Lunch buffet is roughly $35/person. Deserts are extra."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable. Food was decent. Wish all the meat wasn't so salty.  Full but not full enough. All that salt made me sick"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a 5-star experience, go to this restaurant. But come hungry because they have a lot of food to offer. So much food that you'll start to wonder where you'll even put it.   Food: They have different types of meat at an all-you-can eat price. Flip your card to \"green\" and servers will flock to your offering a variety of meats such as roast beef, filet mignion,  ribs, ribeye, etc. They give a pretty hefty portion so if you want to try them all, ask for small pieces. My favorite was the beef ribs. It was tender and fatty to the point that it was the only thing I wanted to consume. Delicious on it's own.   Service: Need I elaborate? They're incredibly friendly, and they'll come to you the moment they see your card is at \"green\". Make sure to flip it to \"red\" the moment you don't want any more food because these guys are trained to really cater to you.   Ambiance: A perfect place to go when you're going to celebrate. While they don't necessarily have a dress code, it's perfect to dress up especially if you're on a date.  The price is up there so make sure you're in the mood to capitalize the food! I want to say, skip the buffet and go straight to the meat. That's where the best part of the dining experience is."}
{"text":"My wife insisted that we have dinner here with the kids and I'm glad that she did. This is my new go-to place whenever we're in Vegas and want steak. Their meats were top-notch and the atmosphere was great. I would still dine at other Las Vegas steakhouses but this would be my first choice from now on."}
