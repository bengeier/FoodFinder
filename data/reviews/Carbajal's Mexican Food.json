{"text":"I went to eat here with a friend and my baby.  The waitress was a bit confabulated. My friend ordered two carne Asada tacos with rice and beans.  I ordered a green chile burrito enchilada style. The waitress only asked us both if we wanted rice and beans, no other questions. She brought our food out and my friends tacos were hard tacos and my burrito was not enchilada style.  My friend did not want hard tacos in the first place, so the server brought out soft tortillas so he can transfer the meat himself, however, she did take my burrito back and made it enchilada style.  The food was horrible, the meat was hard and the green sauce had so much pepper.  My friend couldn't eat the second taco and told the server he was not satisfied with the food.  The owner came to the table and said that most people know how to order their tacos hard or soft. She mentioned that all the meat is fresh and she has been around for 25 years.  So my friend told her then we will not come back. She said \"then do not come back\". She refused to even discount his one taco or do anything to make it right!  I would suggest to anyone, do not waist your money or time at this restaurant! There is better places even for less money and better quality.  As we were walking out the waitress tells me to \"smile pretty\". I got the last laugh when she picked up the credit card slip with no tip!"}
{"text":"Great food great prices great atmosphere toooo!! My husband had the shredded beef taco and chile relleno I had the green chili strip quesadilla and corn tamales. Hmmmm so great:-)"}
{"text":"Went here because my father n law wanted Mexican food. We were in the area, so why not try it. Food was great but way over priced. Don't think I'll be going here again."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible. Over priced. Disgusting. Will never go back. Salsa was nasty. And so was the food.   Do not eat here."}
{"text":"This place is not FAST FOOD and as such, one should not expect fast food prices - there are great people who work there and earn a living off their wages and tips - The food is good depending what you order, some items are great and accordingly priced - they serve liquor, ice tea or whatever you favorite beverage is as well as chips and salsa delivered to your table so you can munch while waiting on your food - the ambience is relaxing, off the main beaten path and quiet if you like to eat in a family or friendly atmosphere. Please give it a try - it's not Taco Bell but then you can't have a beer with your taco or burrito unless you come to this place == it is a great place to relax and eat good food."}
{"text":"I was sad when the Baseline location of Carbajal's closed, but thanks to Yelp, we found out that Carbajal's moved from Baseline to Main St.

Carbajal's does not have real fried ice cream - at least, not any more if they did.  I just ate there and their ice cream is rolled in corn flakes.  It's still delicious though.  Too bad, I was looking forward to trying it.

Carbajal's recipe is simplicity.  They sell all the usuals, including mid-sized chimichangas, tacos, quesadillas, etc.  The average plate sells for about $8.  I always get the ground beef chimichanga with green sauce, sour cream, and guacamole.  It is straightforward, but one of the best I've had in town.  Their sauce is fantastic.  They serve fresh chips and salsa while you wait (and throughout the meal), and they do serve alcohol.

The restaurant is small - about 8 tables, plus 4 comfortable booths.  When we went there, they were accommodating a group of nearly 15 people, so mid-to-large groups are certainly do-able.  Carbajal's plays horribly low-budget Tejano music videos on their multiple HDTV's, which I found entertaining, if not at least laughable.

I will most certainly go again and again, and I recommend Carbajal's Mexican Food to ANYONE who enjoys Mexican food in general."}
{"text":"Came here for my first visit to Mesa, AZ and I totally fell in love with the place! The service is amazing, great food and an over all great atmosphere! Not to mention the margaritas were the best I've had in years! Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent  food check it out if you aren't really sure where to eat in the area. The Chimi  I had was fried just right and had a good flavor profile."}
{"text":"Thank goodness the tacos are good. I walked in and placed an order to go for 6 tacos and it took 44 minutes!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I bring my daughter to the dance attack next door every Wednesday and I always come here. Food is great and environment is awesome. The bartender is OK but she makes up for it by making a hell of a margarita!"}
{"text":"Love the food great place to being the family and eat. Try the Margaritas the are delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I walked in on a Thursday night... sat at the bar and ordered beers and food... asked to change the tv to the NFL network and they were more than happy to oblige! Had the machaca chimi and the wife, cheese enchilada and taco. All was delicious!! Bartender offered a free sample of their house margarita (as they make their own mix...)... unexpected, and delicious! We will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a lot nicer than you'd expect from the strip mall it's in front of. Food was really good and the staff was nice. Only down side was the annoying Latin love music."}
{"text":"Recommended from a friend of the family. Came in for a couple beers and lunch. Not denying it's Cinco de mayo, steadily busy. One server/bartender for a restaurant on a Mexican/American celebrated day. Won't lie... said to the owner or manager she should be helping. But, I got a helping of \"you don't know what I've been doing and a get the f$ck out of here\". More than once with my change thrown at me. Definitely won't return, but I hope my bartender/server has a better day and made a killing in tips for her efforts to give services as best she could. She was making the best of it."}
{"text":"My wife an I visited this cantina this past weekend and we really enjoyed ourselves. The food was really good meat quesadilla and carne asada tacos super good they're red beef is really good as well. My wife really enjoyed the margaritas the beer was cold but kinda pricey.

All in all  a great place to hang out  however the Prices are on the higher side."}
{"text":"This is the same restaurant as http://www.yelp.com/biz/carbajals-mexican-food-mesa-2.

I visited Carbajal's on a Friday night.  They seemed to have a loyal clientele of regulars.  The prices are a little steep like Mi Amigo's.  The food is hearty AZ Mexican food, though not as good, I think, as Mi Amigo's.   I ordered a Chile Relleno and Enchilada combo, and I enjoyed it enough.

I thought the decor detracted from the experience, and the boxy feel of the space was uninviting.  I liked the Mexican music playing on the sound system.

Service was fast.  My payment was completed before I was done eating."}
{"text":"Had the 27 ounce coronita... omg!!! I was toasted! Loved it. D for was amazing! Very authentic! Food was great!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We are here last night visiting from cali and it was amazing food in a Lo key spot we had several small kids who were rambunctious and they didn't mind at all everyone was so nice it felt like being at family.. the food was amazing great Taco Tuesday specials the been dip was spicy and cheesy and delicious the ground beef tacos were the bomb with chilis and onions right in the beef! The flour tortillas seemed homemade too my favorite! I will be back and I'm sad we don't live here"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food.  Chips were thin and crispy...my relleno was perfect, and carne aside taco was perfect, just forgot to make it authentic and remove the lettuce and tomato and only have cilantro onion and cheese.  Waitress was very pleasant."}
{"text":"I've lived a quarter mile away from Carbajal's for 17 years. I made my first visit yesterday. Wow, I knew I had missed something special for all those years My chicken enchilada was delicious; the wait staff is amiable and competent. The decor is pleasant and the restaurant is clean and inviting. I'll be returning to Carbajal's on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place was great!! Meet the owner very nice lady, she came out to say hello!! I had #22. Tamale with carne asada yummmmm! Highly recommend! Say hi to Marina Carbajal"}
{"text":"Had an errand nearby and decided to stop in for their new taco Tuesday special. The tacos are fresh fried and the chicken is so flavorful with just the right amount of spice. I also ordered a side of guacamole and it was so fresh and light with no browning at all. The chips were perfect with the spicy red salsa which was hot and smoky and sweet all at once. Lastly, the margarita? Awesome. Best way to end the day I just had at work. The bartender/owner was funny and personable; definitely good lunchtime conversation. I wish she had a location with more foot traffic! This food is all local, all fresh, all good."}
{"text":"To be honest, i was very disappointed. I eat out maybe 6 times a week, do fast food Mexican maybe 3 times a month so i have abit of knowledge in the food area. The good-  The staff was nice, restaurant was clean.  The bad - over priced and bad quality of food for the price. I feel like filabertos or Carolinas can give them a run for the money.  About 13 for a burro beans and rice. Food was cold and seemed sitting. Rice and beans had no flavor at all and very dry rice. Just bad."}
{"text":"A must try place! Super good food! We have lived in Mesa for 2 years, a lil upset that we didn't find this place sooner! Salsa is super yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some tasty food and margaritas as it was close to an event we were attending.   Great staff!  We all had some good tacos and the margaritas hit the spot!  Nice atmosphere and friendly people, not very large but it was great for us to hang out and catch up with our friends."}
{"text":"I don't know why it has taken so long for me to write a review of Carbajal's as this is what I do.  I have been a patron of all of their locations since before the fire ruined them on Sossaman and Main, they then moved to the tiny location on SIgnal Butte and Baseline (where I understand the owner of the property was a crazy old bat)  and they then retuned to the newer location on Sossaman and Main West of Denim and Diamonds.  The owner is from Sonora originally and all of the menu has not changed despite the change in locations.  It is our go-to place for truly excellent Mexican fare.  We have never had a bad meal here, indeed, this is where my husband and I had our first date.  The margaritias are served in short glasses, but flavored with Mexican limes and homemade mixer.  The salsa is some of the freshest, most flavorful that can be found here.  The cheese crisps (you have to order the cheese quisidilla open faced) are wonderful with fresh flour tortillas and a flavorful mix of cheeses perfectly melted.  
     Some of our favorites are the chile rellenos with green chile pork on top.  It is a poblano chile stuffed with white cheese, rolled in egg batter and fried crisp with a wonderful ladle of green chile meat over the top.  With that come the refried beans that have a wonderful smoky taste of chile and bacon that are as smooth as a legume pudding.  The rice is cooked in chicken stock with sofrito, tomato, chile and pepper to give it a wonderful, homey flair.  They also have wonderful shredded beef tacos that are crisp and juicy and I always have to take at least one home with me, because they are just as good and flavorful 2 days later.
   Everyone on staff is so very sweet and attentive.  They also do take-out and will make things to order with not a blink of an eye.  This is absolutely one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and we are so greatful that they are in Mesa!"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best.  Perhaps I am weird when I expect a Mexican restaurant to serve spicy food.  The food was bland and the server was too busy texting to refills beverage or bring my bill."}
{"text":"Great place. Wonderful service and the salsa is unbelievable. Brought in a large party and we were treated great. Margaritas were perfect and the food was authentic and tasted great."}
{"text":"Just a small restaurant in a strip mall in east Mesa but it is worth a try. The owners are from Deming New Mexico and they feature Hatch green chili's in their recipes. My wife and I tried the Mexican shrimp cocktail and Carbajal burro and both were tasty. Prices are decent and the burro was huge!"}
{"text":"Stopped by by chance and was a impressed with the food. I had the Chilie Relleno which was great and the enchiladas were tasty as well.

I will return when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Horrible place! Way too expensive. And way too tiny of portions. It's a sit down restaurant that's not tailored for take out. They charge double than most fast good Mexican restaurants but they're 3 times as expensive. Just a horrible place. I hope these people either lower their prices, give bigger portions, or go out of business. You choose..."}
{"text":"First time here. Friendly people, very clean. Not too many customers. Took a while to bring the drinks. Menu prices are about a dollar per item higher than the one posted here. Portions are very small in comparison to anywhere else and the prices are quite a bit higher. With that said, the food was delicious! Drop those prices to match your lunch size portions and you'll do great! The pic was delicious $15 carne asada plate."}
{"text":"One of the finer places this side of town. If fine tasting Mexican is what you want, look no more. Great atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Extremely entertaining. Solid portions. One of the employees sucked in helium and sang along with the music playing. Highlight of my month."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place the salsa is amazing and the food is delicious. We choose this place over a lot of other Mexican restaurants. Marina the owner treats our family very well and the service has always been great."}
{"text":"Sara S and Alex S. I've read your reviews and highly disagree. Perhaps your taste buds have expired?  Carbajal's is top notch, family owned,  and is fairly priced. Especially when considering the location is somewhat discreet and easy to miss. The food here is some of the best I've had, and I've had em' all. I won't name any specifically, because that'd be counterproductive. Hostesses are more than friendly. Great atmosphere and decor. It's great being able to walk right in and sit down.  A hidden gem on Main St. Can't beat it..located in Sun Valley Plaza East of Power,  just West of Sossoman North side of the  street, for those who wish to find it...as you should,  because you won't be disappointed. Sara K and Alex K don't know what they're talking about. So check it out and add your review afterwards."}
{"text":"One star for 1$ charge to use a credit card. Should be less stars for their paper thin 6$ quesadilla."}
{"text":"Went to carbajals and placed an order of 12 tacos when I walked in i noticed they were a little busy and it took 45 minutes but it was worth it they are the best will be coming back with family and friends"}
{"text":"My family had a gathering at this restaurant today, my great aunt passed and we had our lunch after her service. The staff was so great, and very accommodating. They served the best green child burros and their Spanish rice was so yummy. Thank you for hosting our large group and being so friendly. The staff made our visit so enjoyable, this place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this spot. I went ahead with the medium quesadilla (half of a whole, large quesadilla) and it was amazing. I have high expectations for quesadillas, growing up on the border where I did. My boyfriend ordered the chicken tacos, which came with a great side of beans and rice and they were also really good. 

We lucked out and wandered in during a quiet happy hour (around 3:30) and made use of the drink specials while we sat at the bar.  Brent ordered the house margarita (in a cute mason jar to boot) and I got a deliciously cold Corona + lime. The margarita was the perfect balance of sweet, salt, and alcohol. Their chips weren't my favorite, but I am a tortilla chip snob. They seemed to kept in a big bin full of them (assorted bagged type varieties), and they in no way tasted home made, but were slightly warmed. The salsa was also okay - again, I'm a Mexican food snob and come from a town where each restaurant family prides themselves on their family salsa recipe. But quesadilla was totally on point. I'd totally pick this spot for legitimate Mexican food over a number of others in the area!

Our waitress and bartender was very friendly and helpful in deciding what to order and I bet she makes some mean other bar drinks, too! I am sure this place is packed when the winter visitors are in town."}
{"text":"Went to lunch on a whim on a Monday.  Place is very clean with a nice small patio with only 3 tables.  They charge for chips and salsa refills.  Ordered chicken fajitas but they came back and said they were out of Chicken. So we had to get steak and shrimp.  Very small portion for 17 dollars.  Food was average. 1 free refill on soda.  
Ended up not charging for chips refill
Service.  Slow but very friendly.  Smiled and followed up."}
{"text":"I was looking for good Mexican food and I needed a place where I could get a margarita also. After reading the reviews I was intrigued by the one negative review that the owner replied back to. I love a place that is a neighborhood joint and any owner who snaps back at a negative review must actually care about their restaurant and customers. I was so right and so happy we ended up here! The tacos are huge and the margaritas delicious! The bartender, Ana, is so sweet and friendly. The owner was there also and she's hilarious. We will be making this a regular place for a quick, casual meal!"}
{"text":"Best authentic food I ever had the owner and staff are super cool my fav enchiladas!!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was national taco day, so i had to have tacos! Im tired of crappy fast food tacos, and since no one can make a bomb street taco in 30 mile radius from my house, I just had to settle for regular deep fried tacos. This place has been here for a long time and I used to live across the street and just never went in. Today my wife and I decided to check it out. The restaurant is small, but very clean and neat. I sat at the bar and had a beer while ordering my food to go. Taco Tuesdays they have a special 3 tacos for 5 bucks!!! I got 2 orders of those 1 chicken and 1 shredded beef and a side of beans. While I waited the owners daughter hooked it up with some chips and salsa. There was 2 kinds of salsa and the one in the bottle had a little kick to it. The girl told me she was willing to make me some hot salsa but since it was like 30 min before they closed I told her not to worry about it. The food took about 15 min to get prepared and come out. The waitress was nice enough to give me more chips and salsa to go. They were so friendly!!! When I got home we dug in and I gotta say it was pretty damn good. It might have needed a tad salt but im Mexican (everything needs salt). My wife absolutely loved the chicken tacos. We maybe making this place my Tuesday regular, price of the food, quality of the food, and the friendly service makes this place worth the trip."}
