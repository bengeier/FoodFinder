{"text":"Man, when you hear term \"sliders\", you think of White Castle's little pigeon meat burgers.  Hell naw. Not at this place yo.  These sliders makes all other sliders their b#tch.  They offer a variety of beef and chicken style sliders to veggie only sliders to appeal to all those local hippies.  Sh#t is good though.  The slider I had came mf stacked.  Ain't nothing wrong with that.  Every order comes with two big sliders and choice to fries or tator tots.  I went with the tots yo. Haven't had those since I was in school.  Sh#t brought a tear to my eye.   The women up there were hot , white, and cool; just the way I like them.  Also the look of the bar was cool. I definitely coming back mo often."}
{"text":"Went once and it was just ok. Did not like the bun but the burger was ok. Went back for a second try and it was awful. The bun had to have been frozen then thawed. The meat tasted microwaved and was gray and dry. Service was not friendly either. I won't be back and bet against it lasting even a year."}
{"text":"This place is such a disappointment. Food was just mediocre and the service was really lacking. Went on a Sunday at an off time- very slow and still bad service. Server was sitting at the bar the whole time gabbing with coworkers- not what I like to see. Also, seems like they are trying to rip off B-Spot. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on a late night outing with some friends.  It was very slow so the service was quick :).  The decor was a mix of trendy modern and Kentucky bourbon barrel style with about 10 large flat screens all around.  We had read ahead that the owner started his career with southwestern style food so my hubby and I shared the loaded nachos. AMAZING!!!  A ton of food for the price and great flavor.  I was pleased that there were layers of deliciousness instead of all the goodies piled on top, that way hubby didn't eat it all!  A bit disappointed with the craft beer selection, but they did have Rivertown pumpkin ale on tap which is hard to find but very yummy.  Will go back sometime to try the sliders."}
{"text":"Went with a group for lunch.  Liked the decor; service average. My biggest problem was the food.  Ordered the Texan (with the chili on the side) and upgraded to onion petals instead of fries for my side.  Burgers were okay, but the buns seemed hard and not fresh and soft.  I asked if they had sauce for the the onion petals and was told by the server that it comes with the appetizer, but not when you get it with your meal.  I did get some, but they charged me for it....really; you give it with the appetizer but not with the meal -- come on.  I feel they were somewhat pricey for sliders and, with the selection of restaurants in that area, probably won't be back.  I can get a better burger at Red Robin for less with all you can eat fries."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour on a Thursday. Had a $5 off $20 food coupon from the Friday! Magazine (Plain Dealer)   Parking: oversized lot with lots of spaces available.   First Impression: Was greeted immediately upon entering. Several people at indoor bar. Decor very fun, reminiscent of a diner with it's red stools and stainless steel tables. Unfortunately, a layer of dust was already visible on the stools and the place just opened.   Experience: We sat outside and enjoyed the patio on a beautiful afternoon. Happy Hour specials included $1 off beer and $5 apple or chocolate martinis. Waiter, David, was speedy with taking our drink order and returning with cold brews. David explained the menu to us, 2 sliders per order with fries or tater tots. For $1 extra you could substitute onion petals or add a side salad. I ordered \"THE FIREBIRD\" topped with crumbled blue cheese, wing sauce, red onion & hot pepper jack. Burger was oozing with grease and consequently made bottom bun very soggy. Meat tasted good. Put more hot sauce on, couldn't taste it prior. Onion petals were good.  My friend ordered just a plain bacon cheeseburger, she had the same issue with grease/bun. But she enjoyed the tater tots. We were only able to eat one burger a piece and gave up. Bill was $29.74 for 2 beers and 2 orders of sliders with the $5 coupon.   Overall:  We both agreed we wouldn't go back. It was fun to try something new tho."}
{"text":"I enjoyed walking into a fun and welcoming atmosphere. I've been here twice and each time the volume was just right and kept to a 60s 70s and 80s rock and roll feel. The decor was very badass/rock and roll. Then came a smiling hostess followed by an outgoing greeting. As we sat the waitress came directly to us and got our drink order. The beer selection was fantastic as it includes 16 drafts selections to choose from and a \"Two Buck Tuesday\" liquor and beer specials. As well as $2.00 tacos to munch on beginning at 5pm. Not a bad deal for a Tuesday evening. The waitress came back with our drinks and took our food order after she slowly told us about the recently opened restaurant. Very interesting to know the meat we were about to eat was from New Zealand! Called \"Wagyu\" meat. & if I can remember the cows were completely grass fed, very cool. After waiting about 20 minutes for delivery (was the correct time based on the high volume of customers. This was around noon. We enjoyed our burgers and fries. I ordered the \"Firebird\" and onion petals, with a side of chipotle ranch to dip the petals. The meat had an exceptional taste compared to past experiences at burger restaurants. Very tender and juicy. The middle was just a little pink. The temperature wasn't too hot. Service was very well considering the amount of people at this time of day. As we finished we contemplated on desert but decided not to. The shakes look very delectable. Including one called \"Campfire\" which is chocolate ice cream, crushed gram crackers, and roasted marshmallows. Will definitely be having my next time here. Over all experience was 9 out of 10."}
