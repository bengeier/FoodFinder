{"text":"Recently moved back to the area, I was more than elated to find a QUALITY grocery store. The Giant Eagle at Legacy is a beautiful and well stocked store. Everything was much cleaner and overall better than any other GE I've frequented in the area. I will drive the extra miles just to get the quality at this GE."}
{"text":"This is the best supermarket i've been to! Granted their prices are not the cheapest as compared to Dave's or Marc's, but GE is really nice and really organized.  Also, customer service polices of the company are so great, easy returns, no questions or hassles.  There are lots of sales going on at any given time. Love this place! Also has a redbox, drive up pharmacy, and lots of parking!"}
{"text":"Giant Eagle in Legacy has the most disgruntled workers in the area. The young lady that rang me out at the cafe slammed my food on the counter after ringing it, no smile, and held out her hand for payment. She didn't say the total and I asked how much it was. She rolled her eyes and sighed and obliged my request.....AND there is a guy on his break from Giant Eagle on his phone, talking/yelling and cat-calling the ladies that walk past him. Ugh - unprofessional and rude."}
{"text":"This giant eagle is a pretty standard grocery store. It's a shit ton nicer than the one in Lyndhurst and faster to check out. The checkout time is ok. There are usually a ton of people here."}
{"text":"Giant Eagle is a supermarket company based out of the Pittsburgh Area. This is by far the nicest Giant Eagle I have ever been to! They have everything! Ice cold beer in it's own refrigerated room, lots of beef, seafood, sushi, wine, lots of ready to cook and pre cooked foods.

This would be the perfect place to go for a quick meal to take home a cook for a date when your low on time and still take all the credit.

Everything is easy to find and the store is easy to navigate. I even like how the little black shopping carts have a little section just for your bread so it won't get smashed. 

All in all great store!"}
{"text":"Let me just say this might be the fanciest Bird I've ever been to!  Le sigh....I just wish this Bird was closer to my home instead of the crappy one by my house.

I happened upon this GE one day for lunch when the water was off at my place of work.  (i.e. things were getting really gross up in there and I needed to escape!).  Who knew the Bird would have such a fancy-pants ready-to-eat section all with a nice seating area so you can enjoy your food purchase right there and then!  I purchased some delicious brown-rice-sushi!  YUM!  The employees I interacted with on this visit were very nice.  I even visited the restrooms (something I don't normally do at a grocery store but if you read the above you'll understand why I did on this occasion.) and they were clean and tidy!

I'd probably shop the bird more frequently if mine was nicer like this one.  So, if you live / work in this neighborhood, I'd recommend you shop this place!  Its sooo nice!"}
{"text":"This place is huge, and has everything you'd want in a grocery store.

Grocieries, lottery, coffee shop, nice service, self serve lanes...great store"}
{"text":"This particular GE is by my gym, so I usually come over here to grocery shop.  It's clean, good sized, good prices and a variety of brands.  The GE closer to me isn't as nice.  Do yourself a favor and look for some coupons as well.  GE doubles up to 99 cents (my last trip, I saved $32 just with coupons).  I like their market area area and it's variety compared to some of the other GE's I've been too.  Be on the look out for fuel perks doubling opportunities as well!"}
{"text":"This is a large store with many food options -- including prepared foods. That being said, I would like to focus on this store's excellent alcohol options.

1. Wine! The wine section is huge, broken into regional subsections. There is even a miniature chilled walk-in champagne room.

2. Beer! As expected, you can find almost every mainstream brewery beer at The Eagle. More surprisingly, however, is this store's vast collection of specialty local, national, and international ales and lagers. The huge walk-in \"beer room\" is great.

3. Hard stuff! The attached hard liquor store has everything you could ask for. Top (and bottom) shelf selections. The prices appear to be quite reasonable, too.

Grade: A (for alcohol)"}
{"text":"Love this Giant Eagle, hands down better than any other stores in the area. I've never had any issues here and the staff is more than accommodating regardless how busy they might be. 

Only downside, if there was one, they recently began renovating and lots of traversing around while they replace pretty much everything. 

By the looks of it, I'm guessing they are upgrading into what looks like one of those Market District stores like they have in Solon? Looking forward when it's done and see how beautiful this supermarket turns out. They have a Starbucks when you walk in, which is a huge plus for anyone that loves coffee. Freshest seafood in North East Ohio, State Liquor Agency, HUGE Beer Selection, Amazing Bakery With Mouth watering brownies, Curbside Pickup, and so much more.

If your looking for an upscale market with endless variety, try this place out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Cashier Katie was very rude did not provide customer service . Did not have a card for me to sign and did not even attempt to go get one made me purchase my items wait in customer service line to get reimbursed that is not right"}
{"text":"Another night at 7 15 long lines and closing registers.  Hey people, help us out, bag your groceries. Let's get some management here. Self checkouts were worse and right now all three of them are blinking. Used to be a great store, now it is just a bunch of empty registers"}
{"text":"Yes, they have a great selection of specialty foods.  Yes, they have lots of extra services at this location (Starbucks, awesome deli/bakery/produce).  But wow, the customer service is unbelievable.  There is none!   The people who work here don't even make eye contact let alone speak above a grunt or greet you.  I think they must have a very hard time finding people to work here, because no one seems to be happy to be at work.  I didn't believe the other reviews until I went there for myself!  And yes, the prices are pretty crazy--try not to buy the basics here.  Didn't even peel the carrots before slicing for my deli pasta salad... who knows what other shortcuts they take here!  Ewwww."}
{"text":"Giant Eagles usually totally suck but this is probably the best one I have ever been to. Quite good all around and they have slices of cheesecakes from Cheesecake Factory on sale."}
{"text":"This was a sad experience. The store was packed because it was the Saturday night around 5 before the super bowl and a HUGE snow storm. Time to bring out your A team Giant Eagle! Not so much. The store was packed... Yes. But items were unusually hard to find. Maybe it was just me and my frustration, but seriously I felt like I was walking in circles. Of course there were long lines, which none of the customers really seemed to mind, but the employees sure did! Wow! I have never been given such an annoyed look for getting 2 bottles of wine and 2 cans of chicken. I figured it would be better because I had so little in hand, but so not the case. I tried to say nice things to the girl checking me out, like \"how is your day going?\".... NOTHING! She gave me the worst look. Oh well. It was one of those \"stopped in because it was close\" but I will not be doing my shopping there again."}
{"text":"This was one of the first Giant Eagle upscale locations, featuring a wider variety of foods and services.  Overall, this still is a great location.  Some foods you won't find elsewhere.  Nice fresh produce and meat.  Parking can be a challenge because it is so busy.  Overall, good place to shop."}
{"text":"This is the best Giant Eagle I have ever visited. The best thing about it is that they have all the cashiers and lines open opposed to the store in S. Euclid on Mayfield where there's only 2 lines open at the most so you can get in and out. If I would change anything about this store is that I would have a larger bakery section."}
{"text":"OK, So your doing some grocery shopping and you get a sushi craving. Grocery store sushi? That is usually crap, hard rice sitting overnight, bland. Wait, this looks good. I will try some tuna and salmon rolls. Holly crap this is better that sushi rock. No shi*. So now when I want sushi take out I call the store and ask to speak to the sushi guy.( I won't mention his name.) I only get the raw stuff. The spicy sauce is one of the best, and as far as I can tell there is no mayo in it! I will even split a platter with my dad. So 5 stars as this is the best grocery store sushi in Cleveland and better than a few Japanese restaurants. And the sushi guy is very accommodating."}
{"text":"Of the Giant Eagle branches I've been to around town, this one is the cleanest (with two sets of well-maintained bathrooms!) as well as the best organized. The store is quite large, and they tend to have a variety of brands available for each type of product. I also love that they have a selection of organic, speciality, and ethnic products. The staff is friendly and helpful if you ask them a question. And finally, there's tons of parking!

Great supermarket if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I use this Giant Eagle all of the time and have never had any issues.  They have always (almost) had everything I needed or advertised.  The store as a whole is very clean, neat and organized.  I have never had any issues with the quality of the product that I bought.  If I have ever had issues locating something, there is normally someone around to help.  They are also very efficient in getting you checked out.  They have a great beer and wine selection as well.  If all Giant Eagles were like this one, not like the one by my house, I would shop at Giant Eagle more often."}
{"text":"Giant eagle is super convenient. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The reason why I give them 4 stars is due to the fact that I find the set up of the store confusing making shopping harder to do. Also, I find that their produce is pricey but the quality is good- so I guess sometimes it's worth it.  Having moved to Cleveland from a big city where everything is open at all hours, having a supermarket open late is amazing."}
{"text":"Coming from wegmans territory no supermarket will ever stand up to my standards. As far as general grocery stores go they are ok... Nothing special other then they are one of the nicer giant eagles. They have a huge selection and a generally clean store. In the back of legacy village its very easy to get to and parking is usally good. The produce is hit or miss and so is the meat department. They have a good beer selecteion but wish they had a better you pick 6 pack. Pharmacy is ok, but the drive thru optin sucks... Most days you can park, go in, get your meds, buy dinner and make it back to your car before 1 car gets thru the drive thru.... Once we move we may never be back here."}
{"text":"This place is huge!  The produce is organized and the places if very clean and appealing to shoppers.  I enjoy coming here for getting a quick bite of sushi from the sushi bar.  So good!"}
{"text":"A very nice GE with good staff and tons of brands.  If you must go to a GE in this area of town (the Heights, Lyndhurst, Beachwood), do yourself a favor and go here."}
{"text":"This is probably the nicest of all the giant eagle stores. It is clean and has a lot of different products on the shelves. The prices for organically grown produce is higher than heinins. I generally am not a fan of this chain but this store is a good one."}
{"text":"I don't come here for the regular grocery items because things are substantially more expensive here compared to where I usually shop.  Many people hate Walmart, but I'm not one of them.  That's where I get most of my food because it's cheap, but when I need a special item I come here.

I was looking high and low for powdered egg whites, Target, nope; Walmart, nope; Whole Foods, nope!  Finally I found them here at Giant Eagle.

The produce is phenomenal and always of a high quality.  All of the other stores I've mentioned don't come close (except WF) to the quality of GE. I rarely find produce with blemishes, I could almost make my selections with my eyes closed and come out just fine.

Anyway, for produce and special things I make trips to GE.  They are unbeatable for these little missions, but you'll spend tens to hundreds of extra dollars if you buy your regular groceries here."}
{"text":"Such a great store, except for the management staff! I had the unfortunate displeasure of needing a manager. I left my purchase of two bottles of wine at the end of a register to go back in the store, asked an associate if it was alright (she said not a problem), when I came back the bottles of wine were gone. The manager informed me that there was nothing she could do, gave me attitude and spoke to me in broken English like she was talking to one of her girls in the club. She offered me a $20 gift certificate for the inconvenience, but informed me i could not re-purchase the wine with the card. Wrong! I went to another giant eagle and purchased wine with the card but... that $20 magically became $16 because the balance was $8.25 and the card only had $8.75 left on it. I called to explain the situation to the manager and let her know the truth to their policies and she found it appropriate to cop an attitude with me and hung up the phone. Horrible customer service!!! Not going back ever again and I'll tell people to do the same. So sad that people don't understand customer service."}
