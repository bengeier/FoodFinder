{"text":"Tasty food, friendly folks. We ate here at the start of Nuit Blanche. We had the shrimp tacos and the porchetta. The tacos were full of bright, fresh flavours and the shrimp was tender. It's served cold, which surprised me at first, but so tasty I got over it. I rarely order pork (like pulled pork) sandwiches anymore because they are usually overcooked (tasteless meat fibres) and oversauced. Not here! The porchetta was tender and porky! The hot banana pepper was a nice addition. Must be pickled in-house because it tastes much better than your usual jarred stuff. If there were a way for me to eat here more often, I would!"}
{"text":"I had Per Se during Nuit Blanche. The food trucks were parked near some of the events so I decided to check it out. It was actually delicious! I ordered the pork sausage sandwich and it was really big and filling. It came with chips on the bottom and those were great too. The workers inside were very nice and welcoming. I recommend this food truck! It's quite expensive (around $8-$12 for the items) but it isn't unreasonable compared to other food trucks."}
{"text":"Per Se Mobile was my first gourmet food truck visit for UofT's Food Truck Friday, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I ordered the porchetta sandwhich, for about $8 I think, and it came with a side of home made chips which was dressed with what I believe to be a horseradish dressing of some sort. I normally don't like horseradish, but for the chips, it somehow just worked for me. As for the porchetta sandwich, the meat was reaaaalllly nice and juicy, and the sweetness of the bread along with the sour/hint of spicy from the pickled pepper worked really well for the sandwich as a whole. Portion wise, it was a reasonable size, and I feel like I got my money's worth. Overall, awesome truck, can't wait to try it's other items as well!"}
{"text":"Found them in Celebration Square, which is across from Square One.  Had the jerk chicken sandwich.  It was $8.  

Chicken was very tender had a soft bun and came with some chips topped with yogurt.  The sandwich was quite tasty, but it wasn't spicy.  I think I would describe it as a \"chicken brisket\". Still good though.  

$8 is expensive, but all food trucks are.  Still, pretty good though."}
{"text":"They were at Corus HQ at Echo Beach as DigifestTO 2014 invites

I had 3 shrimp tacos $9

They did a great job and we're the busiest of all the trucks there"}
{"text":"$8 gets you their Jerk Chicken sandwich - an interesting fusion of jerk chicken, yam fries, and their yogurt sauce. Highly palatable, but nothing amazing. 

I do have to admit, however, that it's a great combination and unique, experimental offerings like this will keep me coming back to Per Se Mobile over a lot of other food trucks that always seem to specialize in the same old poutine or pulled pork sandwiches. 

I was able to try them out at Mississauga Celebration Square when they were there during the FIFA World Cup events. Hopefully they come back often."}
{"text":"Per Se was my first stop in the multiple nights during the TIFF food truck events. At 6:45 when I showed up there was already a line. 

The food on this set of wheels is a mix of Columbian and Floridian inspiration. It's a very simple but delicious menu with a jerk chicken sandwich, a porchetta sandwich, and a Columbian hamburger.

I went with the porchetta sandwich. The sandwich comes topped with caramelized onions and pickled banana peppers. Also included on the side are kettle cooked chips topped with a creamy horseradish sauce. The pork was nice and juicy and was a good sized portion. I'm not huge on horseradish but I liked the sauce as I found the flavour to not be overpowering.

Overall a great spend for $8."}
