{"text":"Great live music on a Friday night! Very chill- I hear they have great dessert- friendly service, nice atmosphere!  The only semi-weird thing is the random location..it was kind of alone and in a sketchy part of town. But I did just move to the area and it was at night...so I may have mid-judged"}
{"text":"The patio at The Harp is very nice with views of the lake and industry. We chose the patio for our brunch on Sunday after church, arriving at about 11 am. I chose the veggie Benedict because of the fried green tomatoes that were on it instead of the traditional Canadian bacon. This choice had a side of seasoned potatoes. When my meal arrived my English muffin at the base of the Benedict was not toasted, the green tomatoes were the size of a quarter (well maybe a fifty cent piece) and the potatoes were stone cold. The eggs were just perfect but the hollidaise sause was skimpy.  Others in my party had the same issue with the potatoes on their orders as well.

Another person ordered the crab cake Benedict with the same issue with the English muffin and skimpy sauce, but said the crab cake was outstanding. 

On the flip side- one person ordered the crab cake salad which was said to be delicious.

Our waiter was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Great pub, go for the boxsters - large enough to share.

Nice outside seating when weather cooperates."}
{"text":"We stopped in after the burning river fest for dinner and we sat on the patio, which is a must if you have not done so.  I chose the Rib Eye Boxty and I would definitely get it again.  The view was great, food was solid and a very healthy portion.  The prices are great and I highly recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"While the food was a major disappointment, the service was acceptable and the atmosphere above par. I had the corned beef boxty. The sauce covered the entree and plate, overwhelming it with its vinegary base. 
Staff took good care of us and was insistent on pleasing us, not wanting us to leave dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Beer was mediocre. Service was nice, but it took about 50 minutes in the not very busy dining hall for my food to come out. Some presented locals were a bit loud.

NOT a pleasant atmosphere.

The overall conclusion is: TOO overpriced."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Harp for Sunday brunch.  The decor is a cute/cozy/warm attempt at replicating an Irish pub.  I'm always comfortable even when I get stuck sitting at the \"little table\" (when we've gone with a party of over 4 people, we end getting two tables put together and one is always about 1/2 inch shorter than the other.  My tiny 17 year old niece even has to work to get her legs under it - but we think it's fun!)  Sitting on the patio is great in nice weather!

Ok, I would be perfectly happy to sit for hours munching from the bread basket - who doesn't love scones?! - and drinking mimosas or bloody marys.  The drinks are typically very well prepared.  If you don't mind a little kick, the peppered mary is awesome!  My family always goes through the bread (three different types) before our meals arrive and we are never denied another full basket.  

I LOVED the veggie benedict.  I would get cravings for it during the week.  I was horrified the last visit to find that it had been replaced by a fried tomato benedict.  I wanted the peppers and onions with just the right amount of hollandaise mixed in!  Please bring it back Harp!!  I did give the fried tomato benedict a try and it surprised me.  I was hesitant when ordering because 1. it wasn't what I had been preparing my taste buds for all week and 2. I am not a fan of cooked tomatoes.  It was good.  My eggs were perfectly poached and the tomato was not lost in a thick chewy batter.  It was a light light batter and didn't taste of fried oil.  The tomato wasn't the mushy mess I had anticipated.  It held up rather well and had a little bit of firmness to it - just the right amount.  The potatoes, as always, were good and seasoned quite well.  I also appreciate having the little fruit cup which always appears and tastes fresh.

I've never had bad service and on a couple of occasions I've had very good service.  

I will definitely be back over and over again for brunch.  If they don't listen to me and bring back my veggie benedict, I'll have to branch out and try something new (GASP!) but I will be back."}
{"text":"Been here both for St. Paddy's Day craziness and to eat with the family over the holidays.   The Harp is in the top tier of Irish bars for me.   Good beer selection, and the food is definitely about 3 cuts above the average \"bar food\".  Or to put it another way, they serve a lot of the same things you expect to find in an Irish bar, but better.  When I eat at an Irish bar, I generally avoid all the things on the menu I don't expect/ don't want to see on the menu at an Irish bar, such as pierogis, which are not Irish, and salads, which are not what I want to eat at a bar with my beer.   The Harp has got  the best shepherd's pie I've had anywhere, and some of the best fish and chips I've had this side of England (seems like it's actually fried in oil and not warmed up in a microwave! )   I took my old Irish parent (a notoriously picky eater) here and she cleaned her plate - I was amazed.  But it really is that good.

Just one warning, bring your appetite.  The portions, especially for the non-sandwich entrees, are definitely super-sized.  I ordered the boxty appetizer and it was big enough to be a whole meal in itself. 

Nice views of Cleveland if you sit in the windowed section, though the fireplace section with no views is also very cozy in winter.  Waiters and staff are just the nicest people, and I don't even personally know any of them.  Ample parking most of the time, and even on crazy nights like St. Pat's you can probably score a spot at the deserted business parking lot across the street (just watch your back and your purse, since the Harp's block is fine but some of the surrounding ones call for caution).  On certain nights, the Harp also books some fine Irish music as well as the awesome local Pogues tribute band, The Boys From the County Hell.  Love the Harp, we just wish we lived closer to it and could visit it all the time!"}
{"text":"We live very close to the Harp and have always gone here with family to eat at dinner, the food is great.  A night they have live bands.  In the afternoon it's a great place to go after work or with your kids for a quiet family outing.  I don't recommend it for kids after dinner as it is a bar, but in the early afternoon we have always gone and the staff are great with to our kids and make them laugh all the time."}
{"text":"I use to work by The Harp, so I've been there many times, the food is consistently amazing.  I always get the soup and sandwich lunch combo and it never disappoints.  I've also had their salads and meatloaf and they are great."}
{"text":"the Harp is a good spot to grab a drink with friends in port credit.
Its always pretty busy and there's a live band on weekends.
The food is ok, nothing special - with the exception being the nachos which are great! they are huge, have lots of toppings and are made on miss. vicky style chips (not nacho chips)."}
{"text":"Consistent. Had corned beef spring appy. Surprisingly delicous. Great view from the deck"}
{"text":"Attention vegetarians! Do not fear The Harp. Last night was one for the record books: Pierogies to start and a vegetarian boxty, bread pudding dessert and the best pint of Guinness in town while seated outside at dusk overlooking the lake - I mean, come on folks. I was reminiscing about the experience today. I felt compelled  to tell my coworkers about the whole meal and they were all envious. Last night, we licked the plate clean. Licked. It. Clean. Now do yourselves a favor and get there before the weather turns too cold to sit outside to enjoy the patio. And if you're too late, don't fret. The inside is just as perfect as the outside."}
{"text":"I come here when I want to sit on a patio and look at the lake with a beer!  The beer selection here isn't huge, but they have a pretty good selection."}
{"text":"We enioyed our view of the lake and the fish and chips and Shepard's pie were both good. Bread before the meal was a cheddar bread and soda bread. A nice touch.  Only issue was the slow service on the part of our waitress. Our lunch took quite a long time and set us back while traveling."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is on the top ten list - because it is really one of the best. Fried Green Tomatoes baby..!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten there but I will echo the comments on the atmosphere.

Good selection of beverages, the bands can be off the charts sometimes. Seen some really, really good R&B there.

The crowd is from 20ish all the way to 70ish. Something there for everyone."}
{"text":"good place , patio seating in the summer is awesome, food is ok not gray though , good selection of drinks ."}
{"text":"Boy what happened to this place???  A few years back this was the spot to be.  The food went seriously downhill.  Old bread, average food, and a noisy freeway by the patio. Dont bother."}
{"text":"This is a such a great place to relax. I always go late at night and miss the kitchen being open, so thats why i'm only giving it 3 stars (for now). But the patio is awesome, lots of room and great view of downtown. Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"Great Irish-American mix!  Awesome location with a great view of the lake.  Wonderful service all around."}
{"text":"This is the Irish pub to go to in Cleveland. The atmosphere is lively, particularly when they have a live band in. The decor is fairly well in line with what you'd find in Ireland (at least as close as you can get in the States).

The signature dish are boxties, which consist of two potato pancakes sandwiching a pile of meat and veggies. The corned beef boxty is the one to have, because this is some of the best corned beef in the area.

Until recently, we would have given the Harp props for great fries. We stopped in this week, however, and were disappointed. They just weren't the same. Hopefully it was just an off night. It's also possible that there has been a staff change of some sort - mort than half of the entrees on the menu said 'new.'

Be sure to try the complimentary soda bread before the meal. Another good choice for a starter are the house-cut potato chips, served with generous portions of ranch and blue cheese dips.

If you can, save some room for Guinness ice cream.

Check the Indians schedule, find a night with fireworks, and sit on the patio around the right time to watch the show after the game. It's a great view of downtown, and there's usually a breeze from the lake.

Note that the Harp has two small private parking lots - one on either side of the building. So before you bail out and start scrounging for a street spot, check the other lot!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I had their chicken boxty cake. Their boxty cakes are decent in size. I definitely would come back and try their steak boxty.  They harp has a really nice ambiance too. I would take a date there. Service is fast. It doesn't take long for them to bring out your order. They have a bar and they're one of the few spots that can do a \"black and tan\" right.

I would go back there!"}
{"text":"Stopped at The Harp after leaving edgewater park. Food is pretty tasty and and they have a great although somewhat obstructed view of the lake and downtown. Try the corned beef rolls they're really good. Also try a boxty, a large potato pancake filled with toppings and topped with a decadent sauce."}
{"text":"Went there a couple nights ago for the first time with a friend. We were seated by the bar and had a nice view of the Cleveland skyline. We had wonderful service and our waiter was on top of everything from getting rid of empty plates to making sure our drinks were refilled. I had a salad which was delicious (and huge) and my friend got a chicken sandwich of some sorts which he really enjoyed. Can't wait to come back during the summer and sit on the patio and try some of the other food. (Although we'll probably be back again before then) I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants good food in a fun atmosphere. Overall was a great night on a cold Cleveland night."}
{"text":"Great food for a great value. 
I had steak and kidney pot pie and it was great."}
{"text":"So here's the deal, I'm that person who enjoys ordering a good fresh salad when out to dinner (yes I realize I could make that at home) but I will tell you, The Harps Greek Salad, with Salmon added might be one of my faves! My fiancé and mother ordered the fish and chips for their entree which look delish however a little greasy, and I'm not sure I would stray from the salad portion of the menu BUT, my meal was awesome! I will warn you though, the service was kinda odd. People would just randomly come try and bus our table when there was still food on our plate....however the place itself has a pretty cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a place I tend to forget about as an option but I have no idea why because I really like the food here. It is great comfort food. The steak boxty is my go to menu item but after trying the Shepherd's pie on my last visit, I might have found a new favorite menu item. We also ordered the pretzel bites with beer cheese and my dad loved the beer cheese so much that he was eating it without the pretzel bites!

Next time I visit, I will be trying brunch!"}
{"text":"The harp isn't bad. I've been just twice. Both times it has been a decent experience. 

The decor is nothing fancy, but it does what it needs to. It's got a classic pub theme and decoration. I'm fine with that. It's nothing flashy, that's okay.

The food is decent too. I've had the burger. and the wings. The wings were good and meaty, I'd have them again. The burger was fine too. I'd eat here again for sure, lunch not dinner.

The service is just okay. I've had pretty slow service here but I wasn't in a hurry so it was fine. I find it odd that it has security on busy nights. They stand outside with clickers and check id's. This isn't really the kind of place that needs that sort of thing, so it just weirds me out. 

Give the pub a chance if you're in the mood for some pub fare that's pretty good."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Had reservations.  Sat at table and waited about 10 min before we had someone come by for drink order.  Out of almost every beer we tried to order!!!! When drinks came back ordered 2 appetizers and then couldn't flag down our waiter.  Wasvbehind bar and when came to take care of table next to us, ignored our attempts to call and take our order.  Left an hour and a half later with no dinner.....shame on you Joseph"}
{"text":"The Harp has the BEST view of Lake Erie then any restaurant/bar in the Cleveland area.  It's outdoor patio is remarkable!!!!  Nice view of the lake and Browns Stadium.  Their food is fantastic and the service is very good.  Gets busy on the weekends, but it's a good crowd.  It's right off of Rt. 2 and they have a large private parking lot.  Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"This is my  favorite first date spot in town! The server knows my name (that is supposed to be a hint at how many first dates I have been on). Anyways, it is low-key and classy all at the same time. You get a sense that you are going to get a quality experience when you step into the Harp. 

I like that they serve hard cider too."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 3.5 stars I would.  We popped in here and sat on the outside deck.  I ordered the Harp Salad (which is a basic dinner salad with tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, carrots and croutons).  What made it terrific was the seasonal Strawberry Red Wine Vinaigrette salad dressing--yummy!  The boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and said it was very good.  This place attracts a lot of businessmen swilling down Guinness after a hard day's work."}
{"text":"snobby and Irish don't mix well in my book. Upscale food and drink. WEIRD location but it does indeed have parking. Very rare for the Cleve I am noticing. I just don't know what to make if it.....confused....."}
{"text":"Irish Soda Bread to start.  Fish and Chips and Boxtys are delicious.  Reuben is very good but some of the other sandwiches, especially the daily specials with soup, can be a bit off the mark.  Decor is cozy and patio with lake view is a plus."}
{"text":"I go to the Harp for lunch yesterday, and the only thing notable enough to say about it was how laughably bad it was..

( Please forgive a bit of beverage snobbery here....)

I'm checking out their drink list and under \"Winter Warmers\" it lists Mango Sangria. Well, first of all, it's June, and secondly just about the last damned beverage on Earth i expect to 'warm my bones' during Cleveland winter is Mango Sangria. What?!?!?

They advertise traditional Irish fare and music. So during my lunch, I hear Ace of Base and R. Kelly and my lunch date had a cajun burger. Apparently there's a huge Cajun population in Ireland I was unaware of.

The best part of my meal was a huge storm kicking up and blowing their unsecured patio umbrellas across the parking lot and hitting every car parked there. Except mine, which was the crummiest in the lot. It wasn't as funny to the stuffed shirt with the BMW next to me, but I found it particularly hilarious. 

I've heard the owner has some kind of monkey he lets hang out in the restaraunt that attacked somebody. The monkey bit is cool and all, but the rabies part- not so much."}
{"text":"Great menu (and solid kitchen). 
Great atmosphere and patio overlooking Lake Erie.  
But most importantly: Amazingly friendly crew."}
{"text":"First time visiting The Harp and we had a great experience. The view from the patio was very enjoyable - you can see the downtown skyline as well as the boats cruising around on the lake. The inside of the restaurant gives you a very nice Irish pub feel, but that does get lost on the patio outside. (The view makes up for it) 

The service was great, we never had an empty glass and our dirty plates were cleared quickly. We went on Sunday just as brunch was finishing and they were packed but this had no effect on service. Our waiter Tom was very friendly and had great recommendations on food and drinks.

The food and drinks were very very good, I had 2 of their draft mixes which were very tasty and well poured. The Black & Gold, which is Guinness and Dortmunder, was perfectly assembled with a clear line between the beers. The other I had was the Devil in Cider that consisted of Angry Orchard and Fireball. This was also very good, it reminded me of the spiced cider I make on Halloween - yummy!
Food was also delicious, our appetizers were the guacamole salsa bruscetta and the house chips and dip. The bruscetta was my favorite - the creamy guac put a nice spin on traditional bruscetta, the bread was nice and crisp on the outside and soft in the center. The toppings were fresh and the balsamic reduction brought everything together with a nice acidity. Chips and dip - the chips themselves were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Their demise is the \"dip\", which is just their salad dressing. The ranch and Cajun ranch were both too runny and were lacking in flavor overall. They need to put some better dip with their chips and they would be a winner.
Our entrees were both Boxty, which I have not had since the Boxty House in Dublin, Ireland. I ordered the chicken and my wife got the corned beef. Hers was the best of the two, great corned beef, a healthy portion of sauerkraut and swiss all tucked in a very well seasoned and cooked boxty then topped with russian dressing - YUMMY!  My chicken boxty reminded me of a chicken fajita with the peppers, mushrooms, and onions. It was all well seasoned and cooked, my only complaint was the sun-dried tomato pesto cream sauce that lacked in tomato and pesto flavor and was not creamy but slightly oily and runny. The sauce needs work! 

We finished our meal with the Guinness ice cream sunday which was huge and delicious - I just wish you could taste the Guinness more in the ice cream. All said we had a very good experience with the food and service and if they tightened up a few things with their food this would definitely be a 4.5 to 5 star place in my opinion. We will be back to enjoy some more boxty for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful evening in Cleveland.  The Harp allowed just that, with a view of Lake Erie and a magnificent sunset.  We kicked back, after a long drive and enjoyed the patio at The Harp.  Karen O'Malley was there to greet us (I had made a reservation with her from home).  Our server was Juan and he made the evening totally enjoyable.  He suggested the Goodtimes boat cruise on Lake Erie, which we did the next day.  Great advice.  The drinks were great.....cold Harp and Jameson shot for my husband and I had Dark and Stormy's.  The salad with brie and cranberries was fresh and tasty.  Also huge, and they split it for us.  We had the salmon boxty and it was delicious as well.  The salmon was crispy on the edges and perfectly cooked.  The potato pancake was well seasoned and the whole thing just REALLY good.  Our evening was finished with a HUGE Guiness Ice Cream Sundae with brownie, caramel and chocolate sauces, honey roasted pecans and whipped cream.  OH MY.  We were happy and FULL.  Thanks to the Harp for a wonderful evening.  One of the few spots with a view of Lake Erie and a great patio.  They have live Irish music a few evenings as well.  A taste of Ireland in Cleveland.  YAY!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful inside and out. if it's a hot day, still enjoy the patio cuz you get the lake breeze. We had drinks and artichoke dip. Definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"Fairwell old friend, 26 years of beers, friends and memories are what filled the seats of this Port Credit staple last night on its final evening before closing  it's doors forever. 

Known for it's atmosphere, rustic local appeal and of course those Sunday Prime rib dinners, it's a location that this Yelp CM wishes he could have spent more time in before last night.

There isn't much more to say about our 'beerly'-departed friend, other than to thank it for years of service to the Mississauga/Port Credit area and wish it's staff and management all the best as they move on to bigger and better things.

For the last time, let's play The Harp out!

Sláinte"}
{"text":"People are a little harsh on this review.  I think the Harp is a great place.  It actually turned me on to corned beef (something I previously hated).  For real, the cored beef is excellent. 
The boxty is good too, I do get upset that they don't have a boxty appitizer.  The side order of boxty does not cut it, they need some crisp boxty slices for an ap!! Do you hear me Harp?  You lose a star for that.  
The patio is nice and contrary to a previous review, they do have traditional Irish bands.  This is in the evening, appearantly not for lunch.  
Either way, The Harp is worth a shot."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Wednesday and was overall happy with the food and the service. They have a small happy hour food menu that has some great options. The loaded fries are amazing, they are topped with bacon jam, cheese and jalapenos...so so good. We also got the hummus which was good as well. For dinner, I got the white truffle perogi appetizer which was also fantastic. It came with 4 perogies and a chive sour cream which I felt was plenty. The only downfall is the beer selection; they have mostly domestics on draught and few different choices (ex IPA vs. lager vs. wheat). They do seem to have a large mixed drink menu. 

As we were leaving, they started playing live music. This is a huge plus on a weekday! I will definitely be back to check out the patio which has a great view of downtown and the lake."}
{"text":"Steak boxty - awesome! I just ate one and can't wait to go back! YUM! Ate out on patio....decent view for Cleveland."}
{"text":"Delicious cornbeef and love the environment, excellent service! Fast service on food too!  Have not tried a dessert from here yet!  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ventured to The Harp last night for the first time. I have driven past it many times, but usually on the way to a bar or other restaurant in Lakewood.  We had a fabulous time.  

The draft list is predictable given the Irish theme, except for the Heineken on tap, which is a bit unusual to find anywhere.  We had an excellent crab cake appetizer and ordered entrees from the Boxty Cakes section.  The Boxty Cakes are potato pancakes filled with all kind of goodness.  My girlfriend got the steak boxty and I got the corned beef boxty. I would recommend either. 

We finished with an Irish coffee that was delicious.

The Harp has a nice atmosphere (especially given the location).  There is a beautiful wood bar and the dinning room chairs look like antiquities from Ireland. They also offer live music Wednesday, Friday & Saturday.

I have to say that I am surprised to see the poor reviews, but they are a bit dated so perhaps things have changed. I would recommend The Harp for anyone looking for a solid dining experience."}
{"text":"Wings. Live bands. Beer!  Service is spotty.  One night it was great, another, there must have been only the one waitress for the entire pub.  The honey garlic wings are great, but it's the sweet chilli wings kick it up to awesome.  Keith's served.  The Harp is a standard, no fuss pub. 'nuff said."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere of The Harp right when I walked in! I loved the wood paneling (?) and the Celtic/European feel of the interior. They clearly have a great draught selection and the post-work crowd seemed to be really enjoying themselves.

We chose to be seated outside since it was a nice day. We were hoping to get a great view of Lake Erie. Sadly, there isn't that great of a view with salt mines, highways, and watertowers all around. Oh, industrial Cleveland. We need to work on expanding our waterfront... for humans, not machines.

Friend ordered a black and tan-ish drink -- cider and guinness. I tried it and it was great. I'll probably order it when I go back. 

I ordered a vegetable boxty, a more traditional Irish meal. It was huge! I saved half for lunch the next day. It's what I imagine Irish food to be--filling, compact but somewhat bland. It was also a little pricy for what I got. Maybe next time I'll get the salmon boxty to make it worth it, and to have a little more flavor.

We shared the guinness ice cream for dessert. Satisfying and sweet!

Service took a little long, but it was decent and friendly.

I think it's a great pub, and I'm sure it's really cozy in the wintertime. I would definitely love to come back but I don't think I'll be super regular."}
{"text":"What a great local Irish pub with delicious food and selection of drinks! We've been here a couple of times now and it never disappoints. Our service has been great each time. They start you off with a basket of bread and the sweet bread is to die for (I'm sure that's not what it's called but it's a white bread with a sweet flavor).

Tonight we got the burger and fries and the crab cake sandwich and fries. I keep getting the crab cake here because it is so delicious! Reasonably priced, actually has crab in it, and beautifully fried. I had a specific request and asked for it without the bun because I really just wanted the crab cake and it came out so nicely. It was served over fresh, crisp veggies with a jicama slaw and chipotle aioli that all went perfectly together. They offer a good mix of Irish food and contemporary food as well (for example, they have a shepherds pie but also have a pecan crusted brie!)

We will definitely be making this a regular place for the food, drinks, casual cozy atmosphere, city views, good service, and last but definitely not least - free lot parking! That's always a bonus with a city restaurant. Great place to bring family, friends, coworkers, anyone really!"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood place. The staff is courteous, fun, knowledgeable, and welcoming. The food is better than it's ever been. Love the colcannon! Had the crispy lemon chicken tonight.. perfection! We come at least once a week. An Ohio city gem!"}
{"text":"This is going under my Fish n Chips list so this review will follow the format described above.

1. The fish.  It was a decent portion size (three good sized filet) and it was white fish which I assume to have been cod.  5 stars for that.
2. The Batter.  This was a near miss. I liked it, it was light and crispy, not too oily and didn't come sliding off the fish after the first bite.  The problem was that it was cooked beyond golden.  It was quite brown.  It was still pretty tasty so I'll give it 4 stars.
3. Chips.  These were good.  They was a sizable portion, cooked perfectly and lightly salted.  Nothing exceptional but very good. 4 stars.
4.  Accompaniments.  Very good cole-slaw.  Cool, creamy and delicious.  Tarter sauce was also cold and creamy. Nothing fancy but plenty of it.  There were 2 good sized lemon wedges and a bottle of malt vinegar on each table. 5 stars
5.  X Factors.  To be honest, fish and chips is supposed to be sort of workman's fare.  I found $15 a little steep for fish and chips.  Also, this is an Irish place, they ought not to have overcooked the fish at all, even if it was only slightly.  3 stars.

Let's see, I'm gonna do some calculations here.  That makes the total a respectable 4.2 stars which according to elementary school mathematics I must round down to 4.  Good but not perfect."}
{"text":"I have been going to The Harp for years. During the winter you can't beat an Irish coffee by the fireplace. During the summer you can't top a Guinness Sundae on the patio! By far the best place to see a sunset over Lake Erie. My fav items on the menu: Beer Cheese dip, calamari, salmon boxty, lobster pierogies, mussels and the meatloaf. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. This is definitely one of my favorite spots around town!"}
{"text":"Great place in the neighborhood but as of 11/1/17 has plywood on the windows and doors. Don't know what happened but better call before you go."}
{"text":"The salmon boxty hallelujah!! Good selection of beers including some sharp mixes they created themselves. The patio is nice and big great for summertime, and if you sit in the right spot you are able to have an amazing view of Cleveland. The staff is awesome, Moira the hostess is so incredibly nice!  My husband had their crab cake sandwich and said the crabmeat was so tender and decadent he was pleased. There's tons of parking and tons of seating it's a great part of the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This will make me unpopular...

THE UP-SIDE: An okay place to get together with a big, loud group of people.  Close to downtown Cleveland.

THE DOWN-SIDE:  What the heck does everybody see in this place?  I've been here a few times and have been really disappointed each time.  The food is just so-so.  The service is impersonal.  The back patio is just feet away from a busy highway.

THE SUM-IT-UP: Why bother with The Harp?  It's useless.  Head over to Ohio City or Tremont instead."}
{"text":"Excellent service. I was happy to see the gluten free options, and willingness to modify the menu.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots for the family to meet for brunch when we are in Cleveland.  It's been awhile but it appears they now have an expanded breakfast menu.  The food is always good and the atmosphere welcoming.  Too cold for the patio but that it a big plus."}
{"text":"Great experience, great food, great service, great patio, a total great time!  Love the views from the patio of Lake Erie.  Truly a must see!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start this review off with dessert, because the Guinness ice cream sundae alone is worth a visit to The Harp.   This was easily the most amazing sundae I've ever had in my life.  The Guinness ice cream was delicious by itself, but they mix in candied pecans and caramel sauce topped with brownie pieces and then cover the whole thing with a mountain of whipped cream and hot fudge sauce (see pic).  Save room for this unbelievable dessert.  

The Harp also has a great atmosphere.  Sit on their beautiful patio if the weather is nice or enjoy the murals on the inside walls.  They have a pretty large menu featuring traditional Irish fare along with salads and paninis.  I decided to try my first boxty and went with the vegetarian.  The boxties are covered with a rich but not all that flavorful cream sauce.  I ended up dipping mine in ketchup, which I'm guessing is not how the Irish typically do it.  

Unfortunately I had to deduct one star for service.  We'd been sitting there a while before someone came over to take our order and in general the service was just slow.  If you're not in a rush, the food is worth waiting for."}
{"text":"We dont get here often, but when we do, EVERYONE leaves happy. Our server today was Joseph and the ph is short for photographic memory.  From boxty to shepherds pie oh me oh my! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, and not quite sure how fair of an evaluation I can give considering the only thing I had was the turkey reuben boxty. However, I can say that it was absolutely delicious, and rather unlike anything I had had before in ways of Irish pub food. The service here was quick and friendly, and I was a big fan of the atmosphere of this place. I can't wait to come back and try a few of the other boxty cakes as well."}
{"text":"Brunch at an Irish pub I am sure you are wondering how this could possibly be good. But trust me it is. I am almost a regular at the Harp for brunch and I'm nowhere near Irish. I have had almost everything on the menu. The quiche is a standout. Every week they offer a different variety. It is always light and fluffy with a flaky crust. The breakfast burrito, crap cakes and American breakfast are also pretty tasty. Not to mention they have a nice selection of cocktails to top off your Sunday Funday. Service is always nice. And they have a great patio with one of the best views in Cleveland. Ironically besides brunch I haven't eaten here much. I think I got a corned beef boxty... once. It was tasty but very heavy! Bring your appetite for that one."}
{"text":"I like the Harp.  It's kind of a local version of a theme chain, but it's better than a theme chain.  The best place to be in this joint is the patio.  The view is great and it's just a top notch spot to soak up some outdoor goodness.  But the inside don't suck either.  It's very warm and inviting.  It feels current, but with the older Irish pub style feel.  Personally, I think this is a great spot to get a beer with friends when W. 25th turns into a mob of people.  And The Harp even has live music!  Good on them for that.  My only problem is that service isn't always great.  It's awesome some days, and other days it's just ho hum.  I haven't had any food problems, but I usually stick to sandwiches.  The food isn't some new culinary masterpiece; but, if you like sandwiches or meat loaf, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"The Harp is the best restaurant on Detroit road. They have the best food. The fish and chips. The salads are so good and so big. The soups is good. The burgers are good. The crab cakes are good. The ruben rolls are good. The EVERYTHING at The Harp is GOOD!"}
{"text":"After leaving I remembered why we usually only come here for drinks. Food was decent - the quesadilla was surprisingly good.  Service was meh - lots of extra cups and dishes at our table throughout the meal. What saves the Harp is their view, I'll just continues to keep my visits to see it sporadic."}
{"text":"Sunday about noon were sat right away on patio and greeted by waiter 
Service was very good and meals tasty an filling
The fresh fruit was fresh but room temp only complaint 
Great view of lake and downtown"}
{"text":"Had dinner there with a friend when I was in town recently.  The decor is great-- lots of beautiful dark wood.  The service and drinks were terrific too.  We had a spicy artichoke dip, which was very tasty.  I had the lobster peirogies, which though tasty, were maybe a bit rich for an entree.  Still, an enjoyable experience all around-- with a very cool view of downtown."}
{"text":"We visited The Harp while on a three day trip to Cleveland. Met up with a friend from the area, and she recommended this place. Although it was a Friday evening, around 6pm, it wasn't overly crowded, and the atmosphere was lovely. I loved the booths, they were super comfortable, as well. 

The bread they brought out prior to the meal was very good. I'd never had Irish Soda Bread before. I'm a fan! I ordered the Spicy Grilled Chicken Sandwich with the hand cut fries. The sandwich was VERY spicy, so if you're expecting just a little kick, I'd go elsewhere. I really enjoyed it, though. The fries were excellent. 

I would definitely return if I make it back to Cleveland in the future."}
{"text":"The Harp is a great restaurant, I had my wedding rehearsal dinner and everyone was very happy with the food. I've been back a number of times and it's always been good. 

Their shepherd's pie and fish and chips are both fantastic and priced very reasonably ($12.95 and $13.50 respectively). They excel at their British/Irish dishes, I can't really comment on anything else. The shepherd's pie is probably my favorite. The meat is very high quality and their mashed potatoes are great. They bake it so that it's just lightly brown on top. Looks and tastes great. Their fish and chips, they give an enormous amount of fries, enough for two people. At least you can have leftovers to heat in the oven later. The fish is crispy on the outside as it should be and you can tell it's a good quality fish.

Their beer selection isn't anything to write home about, but then again, it doesn't try to, it just has your basic Irish beers and some Great Lakes. Nothing to complain about, but if you're looking to try a new beer, you probably won't find one here.

The atmosphere is something The Harp excels at in every way. The tables are beautiful. No wobbly tables here, just thick, solid, hard wood. I love how on the inside there is a small elevated area and there are plenty of windows to enjoy the nice view. Even though it's next to highway 2, you can't hear any of the cars inside. Great! For the nice weather, there's a great porch that has a mix of the lake and industry in view. Definitely a very Cleveland-like view.

Come here with family or friends, it's a relaxing, friendly environment and the prices are great for the quality."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The food was delicious, the wait staff was friendly and the view was beautiful. Over all I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times as friends at work suggested it..  Nice happy hour specials at the bar..  We had cheeseburgers and a couple of Guiness.  Burger was overall very good and was a 1/2 lb too.  A very good bang for your buck.  The Boxtys are great too!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here every Friday for about a month now for happy hour. So far we've had the tacos (AMAZING), their burger (AMAZING), philly cheese sandwich (not bad), corned beef rolls (Very tasty) all at happy hour prices. The bartender Joe is very personable and always at your service. The restaurant is always clean, drinks are always great. I already can't wait until next Friday!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Went there for lunch with coworkers.  Had the fish sandwich.  The fish was cooked well,  but no flavor. The slaw was good."}
{"text":"My teeter-totter relationship with the Harp is still going. And the Harp for me is a solid 3.25. Here's why: 

Things I love: 
- The patio
- The view of both the lake and Cleveland's skyline
- The warmth of this place
- Beer list is A-OK!
- Live music
- It's usually pretty low-key on weekend nights (not crowded like W. 25th) 
- The lamb meatloaf: OHMYGAH, this is some good stuff right here. Good as in, I could eat it multiple times a week and not get sick of it! Tender, moist, flavorful and served with green beans. So delicious. 

Things I don't like: 
- inconsistencies in both service and food

Here's the deal--Before you go here, read the reviews. See what the Yelper favs are and stick with those. If you're going to order a salad, I'd steer clear of the crab cake one, but the side salad is large and very fresh (no ice-cold, I just took this premade out of the refrigerator stuff). Main courses to try would include the lamb meatloaf and the boxty variaties, and other traditional Irish selections. That's what they're known for!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service and a good view. Best Irish coffee I've ever had. The Shepard's Pie, Fish and Chips and Maple Salmon all were great. Very well done."}
{"text":"My daughter and I recently had lunch at The Harp. We sat out on the patio which was lovely because it was a perfect spring day, breezy and sunny, not too hot. The view was eh...freeway, industrial. Too bad. Cleveland needs to take make an effort at beautifying our shoreline. Anyway, she got the grilled salmon sandwich on focaccia and some sort of aioli which she loved. I had the rib-eye boxty which I delicious. Forgot to mention, bread brought out before the meal was really good-some sort of irish soda bread and I believe it was onion focaccia. Also had a beer concoction,  Peach Shandy, which was lager, peach vodka and lemonade. Wasn't super cold, but it was very tasty and fit the relaxed feel of the day."}
{"text":"We've been there a few times b/c our parents like the view and the ambiance w the Irish thing going on.
Service is always fine and they always accommodate us at a table for 8, which is nice.
Food:
-Reuben: good corned beef w nice mix of dressing and sauerkraut, not overpowering
-Side salad: nice mix, good ingredients, no iceberg lettuce
-Crab cake sandwich: nicely flavored and mixed w everything else
-Cole slaw: good, thick w mayo, but good
-Guinness ice cream sundae: lots ice cream (not strong Guinness flavor, closest to light caramel) w brownie pieces and nuts w thick whipped cream on top: nice, woulda liked more brownie, but not 3000 calories like most, so happy about that"}
{"text":"This is one of the first restaurants we visted when we were moving to Cleveland. It was wonderful and we came back several times. Unique, delicious. A few months ago we were on the west side and stopped in for old times sake. We had just sat down and gotten bread, I got up to use the ladies' room. The whole restroom was crawling with flies. Literally crawling, not moving too fast, seeming to be coming from a drain in the floor. What the hell? You mean the staff washes their hands in here?

Well, we hightailed it out of ther - last time we ever visit this place. We didn't even stay for dinner, it was just too gross - luckily the service was super slow so the server hadn't even made it back to our table yet."}
{"text":"Warm, cozy, fun. Good food and good menu with a nice mix of traditional Irish (the boxty & irish soda bread are to die for!) and traditional American (burgers, etc). Great beer list, good staff, they have an awesome patio, too. They have a fireplace as a bonus! I believe they also have live bands. Plenty of parking, too. Cant go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Been here plenty and never seems to disapoint...Went with the mouthbreathers I work with for lunch Friday and we all enjoyed our entrees...
Not much else to say when things are done right!
Although my one work buddy did order his sammy with no cheese, it did come out with and that was the only low side to an otherwise perfect day on the patio....
Love The Harp!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at the Harp yesterday, and though I haven't been there nearly as much as I should have been given that I lived in Ohio City for a while, I have to say this is a great place.  The patio is one of the best places to sit and enjoy the view in Cleveland.  If you don't want your flawless hair ruined by the wind, the inside has a beautiful view as well.  The interior is your standard Irish pub, but comfortable and welcoming.  The food is very good.  I got a fish fry, and I have to say the fish was delicious.  It was very clearly fresh, and a full filet, not a frozen piece of minced up bits and pieces like a lot of places.  You got two huge pieces and some really fresh delicious fries.  I promised my fiance my leftovers, and he was quite disappointed when I put the box on the dashboard of the card and the food slid off and went flying all over my car :)  He got the corned beef boxty  and was clearly happy with it, given that he polished it off in about 3 minutes.   Overall, I haven't ever been blown away by my experiences there, but the solidly good food combined with the great view of the city makes this a place I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This place is low-key, fine sized beer list, with pub food that really isn't pub food standards (in a very good way!).

I liked how mellow this place was in Ohio City, and yet if you had some people to hang out with you could kick it at the bar just fine. 

They don't have a ton of beers, but they have the beers that are worth having anyway.

Looking at the menu I was having trouble deciding on what to get, between fish dinners and their famous boxtys. I'm glad I went away from the fish because the steak boxty was incredible! Steak, onion, peppers, and that cheese sauce that they put on it is light, yet flavorful. I finished the meal with another Dogfish head 60 while my brother got their massive Guinness Sundae.

To note about the menu: Maybe it's been awhile being back in the hometown, but damn it's cheap for quality food!

I think if you are in the mood for some bar food, that's a huge step up from any bar in Ohio City, go here. It's a great place to start a night on the town."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED.

We officially opened the patio here for the 2017 summer season - Can I get a high five? My mom, sister and I stopped here before we went to the Yelp Elite event at Capitol Theater (go there too!!). We waited for them to unpack the chairs and tables on the patio and we were the first ones out there. 

EAT OUTSIDE! It's beautiful. The food was really good. My sis got the Crab cake salad, my got some other salad and they enjoyed both of them.

GLUTEN FREE is so easy here!! They offer a bunch of options and even have gluten free bread. I got a sandwich with chips which was a nice size and I liked it very much :)

ALCOHOL - amazing martinis! We all got a cocktail here. Several hours later after the movie we went back to enjoy the patio at night lol! The basil martini was great and they do a mean \"The Devil In Cider\", angry orchard and fireball.

I'll be back (yeah, yeah I did say that Arnold. No, I am not ashamed...)"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal and the service at The Harp. Best fish and chips I've had in a long time! The salads are enormous and enough for two. While the outdoor patio is nice, it does look over the freeway."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick healthy lunch. They have good filling salads. Today I had the crab cakes with a small Greek salad. Which are delicious!  I never would have thought to pair crab cakes with black beans and corn, but they did and it works! :)"}
{"text":"The chicken boxty was delicious! The corned beef reuben inc and lean! We will be back!"}
{"text":"As a guest of mysterious MIssissagua I ventured into this little watering hole expecting a quiet little Irish pub with some celtic music and a shepard pie special.  It's more of neighborhood sports bar with a couple friendly bartendresses, interesting regulars and a sprinkling of some hot ladies.  

After watching a little CFL on the tele, the sound went down and the 3 man band started up.  It was mix between country & classic rock.  Clever tone play ... opened w chris isaac which was pretty good.

Now my buddy ordered the Widow Maker II!  This was HOT HOT HOT.  He was required too sign a waiver and after the corp attys reviewed it he had a 10 ridiculous wings in front of him.  He must have been so happy that after 3 wings he was crying.  haha.  I tried a couple and it took a long time for the burn to leave my esophagus.   

Stop by to see Natalie and share a Porn Star shot !"}
{"text":"We love the harp great food and great service. 4th of July to see the fire works every year"}
{"text":"Having lived in Cleveland my whole life, I had not been to the Harp til last Friday. And boy was I missing out. 

The drinks are reasonable, the food is great (I had a Boxty which was delicious and my date had the \"best clam chowder ever!!\" (New England that is). And the artichoke dip was great, big chunks of artichokes in it).

Also, the wait staff was great. Seated immediately on their patio (with a great view of the lake). Our waiter was very friendly and joked around with us. 

Overall, a great experience and I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was packed!  The view was great overlooking the lake and The city. Food options are great, especially since they offer Gluten Free options. I had the Beer Battered Fish sandwich and it was decent. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Greasy but pretty good food. It's a little loud if you go at night, because of the drunk people and music."}
{"text":"A storm rolled in and the restaurant we originally planned on celebrating our daughter-in-law's birthday at lost electricity.  The Harp was very accommodating during a busy time and fit us in.   We were all wet, tired and hungry -- and ended up spending a wonderful evening at The Harp.  Food was very good, service was great!"}
{"text":"Prime Rib Dinner Sunday night
Very friendly service
Nice little Irish Pub in Port Credit
Try the steak & kidney pie too"}
{"text":"Some restaurants serve only food. Some also serve atmosphere. Harp does both. Tasty, unique place feeds both hip tattooed crowd who probably walked here from Tremont or Ohio city in conversers and very respectful salt and pepper-hair business-conservative crowd who consider themselves Irish. Outside of both groups, I had a great time and amazing food. I liked the creative approach my calamari were served and the main dish ( steak boxtie) was simply to die for. 
So don't waste any more time reading this and go have yourself a boxitie, mate!"}
{"text":"When the weather gets nice the harp is one of the first patios I go to. Great view of the city and the lake.

The beer cheese dip is crazy good, come with soft pretzel bites.

The food otherwise is solid. The boxtys are definitely something to try. I have never had a bad meal here at the same time I have never walked out thinking it was 5 star amazing.

If the weather is nice and you're looking to kick back on a patio with a beer and some good food, check it out."}
{"text":"Great view! Great food! Great service!

Stopped in for a second time after my first introduction for a friends birthday dinner. Was pleasantly surprised then! Split the veggie boxty and fish n chips with a friend. Both were perfectly portioned! (They split both up on our own plates before serving) this time I got the corned beef boxty, delicious! And my mom got the fish n chips-\"the best she's ever had\" the food is fantastic, authentic Irish (soda bead is amazing), the atmosphere is great, the staff wonderful and the view doesn't hurt! This is definitely my new favorite spot, did I mention I live in Tremont and passed places to come here? Ummm"}
{"text":"Nice little place to chill on the patio. A lot of hub-bub about the view but eh. Crab cakes are good, service was very good, definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great local bands, good beers, baby boomer/ cougarville. 

This place is a-ok. The clientele is a little mixed, but its core is definitely a baby boomer crowd who have been aging with the bar itself. You'll find all your favorite Canadian and Irish common beers on tap. The place is a little dark and cavernous, which can help you in forgetting the time passing, but the bar food here isn't great. However, there's a great hamburger joint just down the block waiting for you when you come spilling out after last call.

The music is mixed, but some of the clutch mainstays are incredibly talented musicians. I forget the name of the band, but the one that's led by trumpeter/singer Joey Reynolds is always a favorite, specializing in funk/blues/jazz. I've never seen them play without filling the house and getting people dancing (which, in an \"Irish\" pub, isn't hard)."}
{"text":"I have been to the Harp many times.  Good location (kind of set off from the annoying Ohio City and Tremont traffic).  Food is good..but I see them getting away from the actual IRISH food.  Its slowly becoming a Cams Corner Irish bar I feel (poseurs) ....I used to like the Irish Fry..dont see it on menu anymore!  If I want panini sandwich, calamri or pesto pasta Ill go to an Italian place!  So many places in Cleveland are doing it like this...sure they have Guinness and shamrocks on the wall...but where is my curry chips, HP sauce and mushy peas??!!  They do have good live music (boys from co. hell).  They charge a cover and it can get super annoying and packed.  The price of the drinks is kinda high as well.  For someone like me who has 2 pints before my food comes I spend more on beer than my boxty!  Ill be back though!  Slainte!"}
{"text":"Best Fish n Chips in town! Staff is friendly, made us feel comfortable. Atmosphere was very inviting and the food was amazing. Could very well become one of my favorite places for 2017. We stopped in on a night that it was raining but I am hoping next time to take advantage of the beautiful patio area."}
{"text":"Wow , on a perfect summer eve watching sunset and the food is awesome and so the service... Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The Harp has one of the best patios in Cleveland.  I enjoy their Cesar Salad with steak.  Their food is hunky, my husband who loves meat and potatoes loves their Shepard's Pie and Boxty.

The staff is friendly and always accomdating.  We eat there often but avoid it on St. Patrick's Day."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at the Harp for as long as I can remember.  Besides having a great patio, and great, reasonably-priced food, their staff is excellent.  It's location right off of the west shore way - 30 sec from the 45th st exit, plus their own private parking lot is also a great plus.

My one request of them is to bring back the Quinoa to the menu as a side dish option.  It was an excellent, lower-carb option to chips or fries."}
{"text":"If you check this spot out do yourself a favor and try the boxties. They are fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as a happy hour patron.  Decent happy hour options for food.  We got the loaded fries which were fantastic... the bacon jam combined with the cheese and jalapeños were amazing...just not enough jalapeños though.  

Happy hour is until 7...select list of good is $5, most tap beer is $1 off, domestic bottles are $2.50.  Wasn't the biggest list but it wasn't overly pricy to begin with. 

There's a parking lot for the restaurant so you don't have to worry about street parking here either (as long as it doesn't fill up). Overall, It was a decent spot for for happy hour with good priced meals"}
{"text":"To Harp:
I can't even begin to tell you the horrible experience we had today (this afternoon) with my 2 friends who I was trying to entertain and show a great time at what I thought was a good place to have brunch.  First of all our server... Tall guy with glasses and dark hair told my friend that he could make them a good Bloody Mary.. She had already warned she was very picky about her bloody Mary's and liked them spicy..... It came out very bland and made from a mix.. Ok fine.. No problem.. Sent it back.. Don't promise a great Bloody Mary if you can't deliver!  Next: I'll sum it up so I don't make this too wordy.. Potatoes: cold... Toast: not toasted and no butter, (we asked for extra butter and got none), asked for American cheese on eggs we got cheddar, the biscuit was cold, hard and stale. When the food runner dropped off the food he didn't ask if there was anything else he could get us... He walked away as fast as he could once he dropped the food.. I had to call him back and ask for butter which he NEVER brought me.. We felt as though nobody gave a shit about us or if we were enjoying our experience or not.. I've been in the restaurant business 27 years and I get that things happen here and there.. But this was bad... Really bad.. And if it weren't for me telling our server that I wasn't paying for 2 of the meals that we ordered I'm sure he would have kept them on the tab.. Weightier never even offered a \"warm up\" or refills on my cold coffee.  This is the third bad experience in a row for your Sunday brunch.. I gave it yet a third try and I was  thoroughly embarrassed in front of my friends that I was trying to entertain.. I mean I was really embarrassed and the worst part was I gave you guys yet a third chance to deliver...."}
{"text":"Excellent service, traditional Irish atmosphere, clean, great food and great pints!  We ordered pints of Harp on a Sunday at noon- the harp was perfect and fresh.  Brunch was being served so we got a special bread basket with scones and brown bread And another fruit bread.  The fish was Alaskan cod fresh and flaky done in a bass beer batter, fries hand cut and you didn't have to ask for malt vinegar!  Served with coleslaw it arrived hot and they were kind enough to split it in the kitchen as I asked to share the ample portion.  The tarter sauce was homemade- no fake citric acid taste. It was a lively Sunday afternoon crowd with experienced wait staff- our server had been there 10 years. Highly recommend this pub and would like to return in the summer when the beautiful stone deck is open overlooking the Lake!"}
{"text":"This place is super relaxed and has a great menu. We a boxy to share, and it was out in less than 10 mins. Got drinks and were on our way to the next place. It's a great place to start your evening! Everything was affordable and the staff is great. Can definitely get crowded around dinner time. A band was just arriving as we were leaving."}
{"text":"I've neglected writing this review because I love this place for the view and friendly service, but I am not a fan of the food. Never ordered anything I really really liked, so now I just come for socializing,  stick to the chips and enjoy the lake Erie views."}
{"text":"Happy tummy! Got the quinoa salad and the veggie boxty to split. I'm actually not convinced that the boxty is that special... But worth a try if you don't know/never heard of it (as was my situation). It was like a savory pancake that was fluffy, stuffed/filled with veggies similar to an omelette, and smothered in some sort of creamy sauce. Even though I found it bland, can't complain! And I certainly can't say I've had better, since I had never had a boxty before.I'd go back, which I think says enough!

p.s. cuteeeeeeeee outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I find myself here a few times a year when I need a good view (the patio is excellent) or I'm craving some Irish music. I've never been terribly impressed with the food -- it's not bad but unremarkable -- but there's a reason it's been around for so many years."}
{"text":"Looking for lunch on a snowy Saturday afternoon as we ventured out to the west side and stumbled upon this gem. The building has parking which was nice for a west side location were this is usually lacking.. The menu was nice with enough options to appease my wife and I but not overwhelming. We both had the soup, New England Clam Chowder. Very good but had a bit more spice then i like. My wife had the Turkey Boxty which was great... The pancake thing was good as well as the turkey. I had the crab cake sandwich. I was in a seafood mood and 90% of the time im disappointed when i order crab cakes. But i keep doing it hoping somebody wont skip out on the crab. Unfortunately they are like 90% of the places ive ordered crab cakes from and had a 80% filler and 20% crab... The food was good so if we are on the west side for lunch again we may come here."}
{"text":"I like this place.  The bar is great. The beer and whiskey selections are very good. I love the decor , the patio and the stained glass window. The food is really good. Try the boxy. Awesome.   The service is spot on. 

I typically buy a loaf of soda bread, too. This stuff is addicting."}
{"text":"Since moving to the area the Harp has become a family favorite. Wing night especially (try the Fire N Ice!). Large meaty wings (no breading) and lots of choices of sauces.  My personal fave is the Hoagie but be sure you are starving. Seriously generous serving of meat in this sandwich!

Its a no fuss no muss pub but the staff are super friendly and the food is just consistantly good!  Have live music weeknights and weekends too."}
{"text":"Pretty nice bar with a solid menu. The patio has a great view of the lake and city. The service is always great and the experience has always been solid, whether you're there for dinner or brunch."}
{"text":"to keep it short and sweet.....appetizers and food very average to below average. i would come here to just sit at the bar, kick back a couple of beers and take off......service, food and atmosphere is not memorable........too many other better choices in cleveland, plus is this REALLY an irish pub???? vegan teriyak stirfry noodles on the menu???? REALLY??????"}
{"text":"The Harp has a fabulous patio. Overlooking the lake it is the perfect place to spend a casual summer evening (you know...when the weather is just too perfect to stay inside!)

I'm not normally a huge fan of Irish pub-type food but I will say that the food here is great. The boxty cakes are worth the trip alone."}
{"text":"After Gord and I left The Pump House, we crossed the street and checked out The Harp Pub.  We were getting hungry so ordered wings.

I got hot wings. Thankfully they weren't breaded (I hate breaded wings!) and the hot spice wasn't too overpowering (I'd consider it to be medium). They were big too. I really liked them and would get them there again. They come with celery and carrots and blue cheese. I don't like celery or blue cheese so our server got me extra carrots and Ranch Dressing.

Gord ordered dry Cajun rub (he doesn't like gunky wings). He had asked for them to be lightly dusted and they were ... there wasn't much of a kick to them.

It's a cute pub. It was fairly quiet when we got there but started filling up quickly.

I'd definitely stop in again when I'm in Port Credit and hungry for wings and a cold beer."}
{"text":"Comfortable environment and quality food, although some portion sizes could be a little bigger for the price and product. Great view and patio seating during the summer."}
{"text":"I've ended up at the Harp more than a few times over the many years I've lived in Cleveburg - I'm kind of a sucker for any place I get get Guinness. If you haven't caught a glimpse of the restaurant as you zip by on the shoreway then you must be paying attention.

The atmosphere is jovial and the decor is quite fitting. The food is, naturally, Irish inspired.

While I was impressed at first, it seems that either the quality has diminished over time or my expectations grew.

I admire any restaurant that gives wait staff freedom to say \"I'm sorry but we messed up your order and we want to do it again but it will take a little longer\" over the kind of place that brings out what even they must realize is a hastily prepared meal hoping that I don't notice. Lately (Mid-Late 2009), the Harp has fallen into the latter category.

I will give it one more chance in a few months, hoping they were going through a rough patch and revise my review when it happens."}
{"text":"I would have loved to have come here on a day when that patio was open. It really did look like a lovely place to have some lunch or drinks. Alas, it was March and that is a far cry away from patio sits. 

We were literately just here and I'm having trouble remembering how I felt about it. Although I'm pretty sure that says EXACTLY how I felt about it. Our experience was forgettable (obviously). The service was mediocre and our waitress had to be asked a few extra times to bring things she forgot. Which would be understandable if we weren't one of three parties in the entire place.

Some other reviewers made the statement about eating the novelty menu items and to stay away from the rest. I 100% agree. The boxty was delicious but a couple other items lacked something. They just didn't have the punch I was looking for. Case and point, the macaroni and cheese...the description seemed like I would have been in cheesy heaven. Oh nay nay...it was fine, yes, but life changing? No. 

They were cool about us bringing in our own birthday cake so that was nice. Some restaurants aren't too keen on that. Overall I would probably return in the summer months, but I'm not running out to try it again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went on a week day afternoon. Not very crowded so we were seated quickly. Order was taken quickly. I liked the interior decor a lot. The Reuben I ordered was tasty (definitely not Slyman's size but still satisfactory) and the table bread was also pretty good. A little pricy but overall I'd go back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to downgrade my previous review for several reasons.

1) It was sprinkling when we were seated on the back patio. The waitress offered an umbrella, but our waiter came over and informed us that they can't use the umbrellas or they'll blow away. It was not windy, and if you can't use them on a still evening in drizzly weather, why do you have them at all? 
2) This time, when I ordered the Pretzels and Beer Cheese dip, there were very few pretzels, especially for the price of the appetizer. They OFFERED more, and an extra handful of pretzels translated to $1.50 on the bill. Seriously?
3) My boyfriend clearly ordered a cola, and the waiter brought him water. At least he wasn't charged for the pop.
4) My salad not only lacked fresh texture, but also lacked fresh flavor. It wasn't good, and when the waiter retrieved my almost entirely uneaten plate, he didn't ask how it was, in which case I was prepared to say \"not good.\"

The patio is still nice, but the mediocre service and mediocre food made for a mediocre experience, at least for me. It took me a year to get back when I liked the place, so don't expect to see me next year."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It is so warm and cozy inside.  I love going here in the winter to grab dinner and some hard cider. When it's nice out, the patio is absolutely awesome--perfect view of downtown, plus you're pretty  much on the lake.  It is somewhat small so it can get loud inside, and the bar area can get pretty busy, but I still love this place. I came here on the St. Patrick's day that fell on a Saturday a couple years ago, and they allowed people to do down onto the lawn, which gave plenty of room for everyone to hang out and drink on St. Patty's day. That really worked for everyone, especially considering it was so nice out that day.

A couple of times, I have just gotten a regular burger with some French fries.  Nothing too complicated, but oh-so-good.  Want an app before your meal? Go for the beer cheese dips.  You get little soft pretzel bites with it...omg yum. Aside from all that, they do give you two types of bread Irish bread--one is very salty and I really don't like it, but the other one is super good. 
Now, if this is your first time here, or for whatever reason you know it'll probably be your only time here (you from outta town?) you definitely need to get a boxty cake. Any other Irish place I have ever been so, I have never seen these. I love, love, love the chicken boxty (no mushrooms though, yes I'm weird).  Sure, some people might say that the potato pancake gets too soggy, but I don't think so. Even when I box up my leftovers and finish it the next day, it's still so good.

Not gonna lie, the servers are hit or miss.  The last time I went I had a girl server that recommended a really good mixed cider drink.  When I got my boxty, they had put mushrooms on it even though I said no mushrooms, and she gladly took it back and had them re-make it. She was really nice, but I have sat in the bar area where every time I got this male bartender I just thought, \"oh great...\" he wasn't very friendly, just flat-out had a bad attitude.  I haven't sat at the bar area in awhile, so hopefully he isn't still there, because this is such a great spot I would hate for someone to not come back because of this bad apple.

They do have live bands from time to time as well, they post about it on their Facebook page, and a couple years ago they joined the string of bars and restaurants that participate in Dyngus Day, so you can get your polka in every April there too."}
{"text":"Wow amazing. The crab cake sandwich was excellent.  The fries were amazing  (i got the herb aoili on the side instead of ketchup.  You should do this too!)

The white sangria was meh. I would skip this next time. 

The patio and dining area are nice, but the view is....weird. Let's all look at a highway everyone! 

All in all super happy with my decision to eat here. I can't wait to eat that sandwich again!!"}
{"text":"Just left The Harp after taking a recommendation from an ex-pat from the area. My review? Meh. But then again, I find most Irish pubs to be that way.

Since I'm a beer geek, I'll start there. Sucks. Simple enough. Nothing exciting for my palate. Again, I've come to expect that from an Irish pub. Please, something other than Guinness? Yeah, I know it's incredibly popular. But so is Budweiser. Doesn't make it any better. There are plenty of great Irish craft brews that could have been on the menu. 

We ordered their signature Irish pancake dishes, which had a name that I forgot. The taste was OK, but nothing special. Sure, I ate it and didn't complain. But I was hungry. Having it hotter than \"warm\" would have been nice. And it's not like the place was all that busy. Guessing that it is what it is.

Will I be back? Probably not. But then again, I rarely visit any Irish pub more than once. Have yet to find one that sets my soul afire."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  We sat on the patio and it was kind of neat seeing the highway and city view.  Too bad there is a lot of construction going on across the highway.  Patio and insides are nicely finished and right up my alley.  Food was fairly good and they were nice enough to split the salad for me and my fiance.  Beer selection was good.  Definitely like."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE ATOMSPHERE!!  went there for the first time a couple days ago and loved walking through the irish pub to the patio.  Ok so basically the atomsphere is why I'm giving a 3 star...  
The wait staff was friendly but understaffed, poorly managed or just slow... i felt bad because the table near us was waiting over 20 minutes to get their tab.  There were times where i wouldn't see our waiter on the patio for over 15 minutes.. which i felt was a little odd with how busy the patio was.
The food was ok.. my husband got a burger which he said he liked but nothing to write home about.. i got the mussels because i LOOVE MUSSELS!  However this time.. i didn't love so much..  not sure if i just didn't like the suace they were in or if because right when they were brought out to me they had a waft of rotting fish smell.. 
Perhaps this is a great place to just get drinks and hang on the patio or the adorable inside bar.. but when it comes to the full meal i will be going somewhere else"}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Irish pub experience in Cleveland, this is where you need to go. A fresh pint o' Guinness and a corner beef sandwich, and your belly will be full and your heart will be happy. Sit outside on the back patio and watch the traffic drive slowly down the shoreway towards downtown Cleveland and soak it all in. A beautiful vantage point of the downtown from the near West side will be your canvas as you enjoy the Irish pub atmosphere, great food, good beer selection, and friendly staff. Out of the many \"Irish\" pubs in Cleveland, this is one of the oldest and most authentic, definitely worth your visit."}
{"text":"The Harp has one of the best patios in the Cleveland area, making it the perfect spot for a meal or happy hour with friends. I'm quickly becoming a Friday happy hour regular. Located right off of Route 2, the restaurant has a great view of the lake. The menu is diverse, offering different appetizers, salads, sandwiches and main courses. It's not your typical bar food. Everything has a little bit of flair. Try their Brie with honey and walnuts or their beer cheese dip...so delicious!  The staff is always friendly and eager to please. Have a special request from the bar? They'll try it. I'd strongly recommend you visit The Harp for a drink or a great meal!"}
{"text":"We went a few months ago. The service was okay, a little slow. I loved the look of the place, and the feel of it. I got a Boxty, and I really liked it. But, my boyfriend got the lobster ravioli. Thirty minutes later he felt really ill, and ended up getting sick. If you go stay away from the lobster ravioli!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited The Harp on Sunday Feb. 5 and had the Corned Beef Boxty and Bread Pudding. It was delicious   The atmosphere was quiet and we were able talk at a comfortable level. The waitress was attentive and friendly with a happy face making our visit pleasurable. 
The only drawback was we were below the heater vent with a control. Seems the thing is either putting out too much hot air or is off. Management should have it serviced."}
{"text":"Being a proud Irish American, I'm partial to places like The Harp. There's something about the ambiance, the beer selection and the music that appeals to me. 

That being said, The Harp is one of my favorite restaurants in CLE! Everything on their menu is so yummy. I'm partial to their selection of boxtys (boxties?). The rueben one is definitely my favorite. I'm also in love with the soda bread they serve before the meal. Though it may not be as good as my great-aunt Pat's recipe, it sure comes close. 

Though Irish culture isn't everyone's thing, definitely check out The Harp if you're craving some hearty food. You might just find yourself enjoying the live fiddle playing and the cozy atmosphere with some close family and friends. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at The Harp finally today.   I had the chicken boxty, which was delicious.  My friend got the shepherd's pie.  It looked great but tasted terrible.  Sooo loaded with sage.  The breads brought to the table were very good.  So a bit of a mixed first review.  I'd like to go back and try some other entrées."}
{"text":"Love the brunch!! If you're looking for semi-vegetarian the Veggie Benedict is amazing! The first time I've ever had hollandaise and I actually like it! Also shared the oatmeal French toast with my and it was so sinfully delicious :) the atmosphere is cozy and the view of the lake was a nice touch! Can't wait to go back in the summer and enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"I just came back from brunch and it was so delicious. I had their chicken and waffles/eggs Benedict. It was perfect and I would 100% recommend. The waitress Aimee was very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 2 stars (instead of one) because at least they DO offer gluten-free (GF) options.  However, GF bread is 75 cents extra.  Come on--GF bread isn't THAT much more expensive than regular bread.  As is common with GF dishes in restaurants, the portions are smaller...for more $$.  The GF caprese sandwich was small.  I haven't seen the \"regular\" caprese, but I suspect it's much bigger than this.  I asked for slaw as my side, and got a portion about 1/4-1/2 cup size.  Really?  How expensive is cabbage?   Oh yeah...it's not.  This meal looked tiny on the plate.  When I was done,  I realized, wasn't there supposed to be pesto on this sandwich?

I ordered a hard cider with this, and the bill came to $18, including tip!  For an appetizer-sized meal?  An hour after I got home, I was hungry again, and I'm a woman (and not a big woman)--it doesn't take a lot of food to fill me up.  Will I go back to the Harp?  Only if someone treats me--I'm not handing over any more of my money."}
{"text":"I retract my previous conclusion that I was somehow sickened by the food at Harp.  It just so happens that I acquired a week long flu and the horrid, sudden onset of said flu occurred within minutes of me arriving home from Harp.

So-- I love Harp.  The atmosphere is lively.  The food is good.  The music is brilliant.  Good craic!"}
{"text":"I have never been here before and when I found out we were going here and that it was an Irish bar and pub I knew it would be a great place. First off when we got there first thing I noticed was the amazing breathtaking view of Cleveland. I highly recommend sitting outside on the patio. You get the amazing view of Cleveland and the shore and if the weather is nice you get that as well. The food is delish and they have a eclectic bar menu filled with Irish beers and IPAs. There staff is very generous and you can even purchase a souvenir t-shirt for $15 not a bad deal. We didn't get to experience their dessert menu but I had a feeling there was so tasty Irish items featured on the menu."}
{"text":"Putting a little \"oh\" in Ohio.

Coming from the Loop (and I am proud) I was skeptical that Cleveland would have much to offer.  Though I was offered a free meal at the Harp for some tasteful \"Irish-inspired\" fun.

Atmosphere:  Combo of the dingy of a bar, with the seating of a TGIF.  Its pretty family friendly, but we must have come during \"ladies night\" because all the middle aged women were intoxicated and going supersonic.  Overall, both 4 person tables and group seating are available, though not huge on decor.

Service:  Ran sort of slow, but always filled my Coke glass.  This is not fine dining, but service staff was pleasant and helpful.

Food:  Pretty much the same menu you would get at a TGIF, with pretty standard fare.  The reason for the generous 4 star was a good selection of appetizers, from Crab Cakes, to Calamari, to Quesadillas  I had the Chicken pasta, which was nothing special, just good old fashion food.  I had their Cheesecake, which was a downright disappointment, so any appetizer love has dried up.

Mommy Factor:  This is a place I would probably bring the folks.  Its not a fancy place by any means, but its pretty benign that parents would not mind.  SInce it still is \"bar like\" its not a truly kid friendly place, but there is no reason why they wouldn't be welcomed.

Date Factor:  I would definitely not use this as a first date, more so because I would afraid of getting Tetanus, but this is not a terrible place to bring an established significant other.  

Bling:  Since I was not paying, I didn't mind the adventure.  However, appetizers ranged from 5-8 bucks for a sampling for 4 people.  Entrees ranged from 10 -20 bucks, with cuts of meat and fish ranging for about 15 bucks.

Upshot:  Overall, decent food, decent portions, and a TGIF vibe which  which I could definitely see Drew Carey frequenting."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful location as far as a view of Cleveland goes. They have a lot of different beers on tap which is nice of you are looking to try something new. The service was pretty good, everything was on time and our orders were all correct. I got the sheperd's pie and my friend got the salmon boxty, both were terrific. Highly recommend this place. The only issue I had was parking."}
{"text":"Great patio.  It's huge, so generally you don't have to wait long to be seated.  The food was solid, definitely not your usual bar and grill fare that comes frozen and premade.  Potato pancakes, reuben, sheperd's pie... all delicious.  Some people complain about the surroundings, such as a little noise from the shoreway.  They're just not being reasonable, you have a beautiful view of the lake, the Rock Hall, downtown, and your meal is running you $10-20, with most options in the low teens.  Where else can you come close to this experience in Cleveland at this price point?  They could probably raise their prices 50% and still pack the place on a Friday night.  But again -- I don't feel they are selling on price -- the food quality was very good.

Update 7/19/2012:
Went there last night for dinner.  This was the second time in a row that service was poor so I felt I had to edit this review.  Once our order was taken, we didn't see our server again till about 10 minutes AFTER everyone's plates were empty.  (They had kitchen staff bring out the meals as is customary these days, and one time someone came by offering drink refills.)  I understand that servers go on their dinner breaks, but then whoever takes over for that person needs to pick up the slack.  Management needs to monitor this better, recurring 'fair to poor' service is starting to sour my opinion of The Harp.  Food and atmosphere continues to excel."}
{"text":"I snuck in one more patio lunch before fall. The patio was packed including with a large group from a senior senior. The inside was maybe 25% full as well. Service from the waiter and kitchen remained fast however. 

I finally tried something other than the Shepherd's Pie (which is amazing). The Grilled Salmon Wrap I can now also recommend. 

The wrap was large and had a full filet of salmon in it. The tomatoes were fresh and the jicama slaw gave a great juicy, tangy flavor to the wrap. This was a filling lunch that I'd certainly order again."}
{"text":"I've been to real pubs in Ireland and this place is on par with the decor, the solid wood benches and tables (believe some if not all imported from Ireland). They have an outdoor patio, bar and restaurant area and the place was packed when we stopped in for dinner. We had homemade pretzels with homemade beer cheese-OMG it was like molten goodness in my mouth. The Shepherds Pie was a little less noteworthy. The presentation was lovely but fell flat on flavor. It was so bland we had to salt it. Over and over again. I'm not a fan of salting food and can't remember the last time I had to do it.  Very disappointing since we had such high expectations."}
{"text":"Overall great place for a meal. Extremely loud loud, due to a lot of deaf elderly men. Prices are okay.
Portions are good. Service was great!"}
{"text":"I'm going to go middle of the road since I ended up going after Taste of Tremont so I was a little fooded out. My tablemates got artichoke dip which was supposedly good and all of the entrees looked great. My friends loved their food. I split the lobster pierogies and it was a little rubbery for me (pierogies and lobster unfortunately) but the sauce was good. I think this place has a lot of potential but I think I would need to come back to really try the food out."}
{"text":"I think you would be hard pressed to find a better battered cod fish and chips meal in the area.  They serve 2 large pieces of crispy, thick cod and it is not greasy.  The meal comes with fresh cut fries.  Fries are well done, crispy and tasty.  The cole slaw, not so much as only tasted only the mayonnaise. Also ordered the hot corned beef reuben sandwich with chips.  Sandwich bread was toasty and not soggy.  Some places don't master that part.  Sandwich was loaded with very lean corned beef and tons of sauerkraut.  Only wish was to have some horseradish to go with it.  Potato boxty was okay, but probably would not try again.  Also tried the crab cake salad and wish I ordered differently.  I ate the crab cakes and salad separately and got a different dressing.  Anyway, I would go back for the fish and chips and reuben any day."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Harp is very fun and unique. I've never seen such a great menu of Irish meals and drinks before, so I will definitely be back to try more of them! I had a mixed beer called a black & gold (Guinness with Dortmunder Gold, an awesome combination). We enjoyed the shepherds pie and a corned beef \"boxty,\" both very good. I also had to try their Irish Coffee (secret recipe...it includes Jameson and Baileys). We loved the experience and  can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed! I usually get the mussels and my friend gets the crab cakes. They're delicious to share! I also get the salads, they're all so good and fresh! Last time I got a Boxty. I've never heard of this before but it's a dish wrapped in a potatoe pancake. I got the salmon and my friend got the corned beef. I thought the corned beef was much more hearty and in a yummy sauce. The salmon was very good but I think was a weird combination with the potatoe. Next time I'll forget about being healthy and get the corned beef if I want a Boxty."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for dinner. 
First of all I was surprised by the ample parking which made me happy cause it was freezing outside. 
The place was overall pretty empty, but it is Wednesday evening and 8 degrees outside. 
I don't like beer, so I opted to just drink cola today so I can't comment on the beer. 
For dinner I ordered the turkey boxty which is a potato pancake folded over with stuff inside. Of course, I wanted it made different than on the menu with the waiter was very kind about. When it came out. I was pleased with the size, not huge, not tiny. The potato pancake was a good texture and so was the turkey inside. The Russian dressing was a good flavor with it. I had my boxty with the coleslaw on the side...it was very sweet and creamy, which is not my fave kind of coleslaw, but that's no fault of theirs. I thought even without the slaw, the boxty had a good flavor. 
I was at dinner with three others and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. 
The prices are fair- husband and my dinner for about $30 (no alcohol).

I'd like to return to try a few other things on the menu as I thought the menu had a surprising number of items for a pub. I'd also like to go back and try some off the mixed drinks. There were were a number of hot beverages that sounded fantastic, but like I said, unfortunately it's Wednesday and off to work I go in the morning. . .

My biggest gripe was, it was cold inside! But overall, I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The Harp is a good place to get a sandwich or a breakfast either of which is better with black Irish beer.

I have been to the Harp for breakfast and I got eggs and other interesting breakfast fare including black blood sausage. If I were cool I'd tell you that I ate the blood sausage like Anthony Bourdain eats the ass out of an ostrich but in fact I didn't even try it. I didn't even give it a chance because it is oats soaked in blood, simmered in water and sliced thin.

You know what? I am proud that I didn't even try that blood sausage. I am glad that I just stabbed it a few times and let them have it back. 

It is gross to eat blood and guts and offal and I can afford not to eat that kind of shit. The reason that Irish people ate this back in the day was that they couldn't afford not to. Ditto that nasty tripe soup at this pho and that pho. I'll bet that the guy who runs the Harp meets with the guy who runs Superior Pho for lunch and they get a Moxie burger and an over-priced Brooklyn Lager. Good for them. They can afford to eat better. 

The eggs at the Harp are good and the bread/toast is good stuff too. The sandwiches are great for lunch and you can sit out on the patio and eavesdrop on the bank cubicle people celebrating Jo-Ann's birthday. They drive out from downtown every day. I like them. Sometimes I wish I were one of them. I have had a lot of sandwiches at this place and I can tell you, if you are hungry, you will be happy with what you get.

I always get a Guinness at the Harp because Guinness is good and they do a good job keeping the keg lines clean so you don't get that Lake Erie smell with every sip. Guinness at the Harp seems better somehow. Especially in the morning. They don't act surprised that you want one. And you do want one. Hell, that's why you're at the Harp whether you admit it or not.

You can see Cleveland Browns Stadium from the patio which is cool.

I like this place and you will too as long as you get the Guinness instead of the Iced Tea. Don't get the Iced Tea because this is an Irish pub. Show the place some respect."}
{"text":"Atmosphere on patio was nice. Amy our server was wonderful. The artichoke dip was the best ever and the 7 of us enjoyed our meals."}
