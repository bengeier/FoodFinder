{"text":"I just tried Gyro Point, this evening using Ubereats. Food was fresh and warm and very tasty. Everything about the Gyro is authentic. The price was affordable. I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Very clean, great portion size, and very tasty. I ordered the gyro and hubby beef kabobs. Fries filled more than half my plate and gyro had plenty of delicious meat. Beed kabobs filled a big oval plate with salad, rice and chunks of great tasting beef. Will come again."}
{"text":"This is a nice new place in the neighborhood. The gyro pitas are on point and my wife loved the falafel plate. Definitely going back for more"}
{"text":"Man I hate giving one star reviews but sometimes it's necessary I always try to look for one thing that I liked to give them at least two but this place could not find anything from the time you walk in the door with a very rude service every time you try to ask him something it's what what at first I thought is English wasn't very well my spoke perfect English it was just him very rude I finally ordered a falafel honestly it was probably the worst Falafel I've ever had from the bread being old or whatever was wrong with it it was so hard and tough me my jaws hurt finally gave up on that and just ate the Falafel and salad inside Falafel was way over cooked Superdry at literally pulled all the moisture out of my mouth couldn't drink enough water to get it back do not get the falafel Little Greek salad that was bad too is lettuce a few cucumbers small amount of feta black olives not kalamata olive and some nasty dressing never go back there"}
{"text":"We were visiting from California and found Gyro Point on Yelp. My husband got the gyro sandwich and I had the falafel sandwich, we shared a side of hummus. The lamb in the gyro was unbelievably tender and flavorful. The meat even comes off of roaring spits! The falafel was super moist and also incredibly flavorful. Hummus was obviously made fresh and was absolutely delicious (we strongly recommend dipping your sandwich in the hummus for an extra boost of texture and flavor.) Topped the meal off with some of the best Baklava we have ever had! Great little place if you like Mediterranean."}
{"text":"I came here last Friday night just an hour before they closed to get me and my hubby some take out. The gentlemen behind the counter were very nice. I ordered 2 gyro plates and some Greek fries. The fries were AMAZING I even ate them together with my salad lol. The gyro meat was wonderful and so was the tatziki sauce. We will definitely be going back to get more Greek fries and maybe try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Just tried lunch here and it was wonderful! I got the gyro combo meal to go and it was delicious. If you are thinking about trying it out because you drive by it all the time, for sure recommend it!"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place and finally decided to give it a try. Very yummy! Me and my husband both got the gyro pita. The gyro meat was delicious! Very flavorful and tender. The restaurant itself is nice and clean. The man who took our order (maybe the owner?) was super nice! We will be coming here from now on instead of the other gyro restaurant :) we loved it and can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"So glad I have a neighborhood Greek place too eat now. SMALL but clean place.   I have had the gyros, chicken Shawarma and salad with grilled chicken. I have not been disappointed yet. My husband loves lots of meat and Gyro Point always gives us large portions. The salad and all veggies are always fresh and crisp. Love the hummus and fresh pitas too."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem in the heart of Peoria.The chicken salad is Delicious and my husband loved his gyro(big portions).Food is fresh, big plus!!! Will be definitely be going there again. Clean restaurant and plenty to choose from there menu:)"}
{"text":"I noticed this new restaurant in our area and decided to try it out. The place is located in an older slightly run down strip mall, but don't let the location scare you! When my husband and I walked in for lunch, we were happy to see a very nice, open, clean restaurant. We both had the gyro meal with fries and a drink. The meals were well worth the price ($8 per meal.) The gyros had a large amount of meat and the plate overflowed with fries. The gyro meat was seasoned well, the pita tasted fresh and fries were hot and crispy. I took baklava to go and it was very good, too. It was savory with a hint of sweetness. I will definitely be back to try some other items!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I always love finding new Greek restaurants, especially when they're nearby.  I love gyros, and was quite excited to read the other reviews about how good it was.  I will admit, the place was quite clean...but, that's where our experience changed course.  We arrived about an hour before closing, and were the only ones there.  My mouth was watering thinking about having my gyro, so I ordered the combo with fries and drink.  Hubby ordered the beef shwarma combo.  We also got an order of hummus to start.    I have a lot of pet peeves, one of them is not getting a starter before my meal.  We sat for a while before all our food was brought out at once.  We should've had our hummus within a few minutes of ordering it.  Anyway, when we tried it, there was something quite bland about it.  I kept thinking it lacked any acidity, hubby just thought it lacked seasoning...whatever, it wasn't great.  My gyro looked good, and the fries were definitely crispy, so I shoved the \"meh\" hummus out of my mind and went for it.  When I picked up my gyro, it was cool...not warm, not sorta warm...cold.  And, another pet peeve of mine, the pita felt like it had been shoved in a microwave to warm it up, but by the time it cools down, the edges get all hard and chewy.  Well, that's where my pita was.  Oh well, hopefully the gyro meat and tzatziki will save the day...nope!  The meat tasted quite bland, as well, and had no seasoning or crispy outer layer, it tasted like it had been sitting around.  I was hungry, so I ate most of it, but decided to never have it again.  I will admit, the fries were really good...they were crispy and actually tasted like they were just made...at least something was.  Hubby ate all his shwarma, but also commented that it didn't have a lot of flavor, either.  We were both very disappointed, especially knowing it's only a few minutes away.  We would've been frequenting this place a lot, instead, we'll just keep on the lookout for another place, hopefully nearby."}
{"text":"Food was decent... service not so much. My experience with Greek food is not vast. (Pita Jungle.) I walk in and had no idea what to order. I saw a menu item that said \"combo\" so I thought it would be a good way to get a few things to try. The young guy behind the counter asks me \"what kind of meat?\" I said \"What are the options?\" He looked at me like I had just grown a third eye. He eventually says \"do you like beef or chicken?\" I replied \"beef\" he again paused. He says \"you have to choose\" I said \"I did, I want beef\" he says \"only beef, you can choose 3?\" I replied \"what are the choices?\" He says \"like beef or chicken?\" Eventually (after a few back and forth) settle on beef and chicken and lamb.  After I pay and sit down he calls an older guy over and they start speaking in another language while looking my way and laughing.   Yes it's my fault that I walked into a place in a  strip mall to order Greek food in America and don't know what kind of meat they cook here. (Sarcasm.) Way to make your patrons feel dumb.   I ate my food and promptly left. I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My friend had just bought a new car and we were out cruising. We were hungry and stumbled on this place in sleepy Peoria. And they were open at 8:30 on a Tuesday night. There was only one customer and one employee, Sam.  My friend placed his order and Sam asked him \"two\"? I was going to order my own meal but Sam turned away and started cooking the order, ignoring me. I thought how inefficient, he's going to cook the whole thing THEN take my order. He was working his butt off in the open kitchen. It was nice to see they had a clean grill and spotless cookers, not a microwave in sight. He was so busy cooking the order from scratch I couldn't get his attention. When he was finally bagging my friends to-go order I was able to interrupt him and explain that he must have misunderstood that I also wanted to place an order.  I've seen reviewers get angry about stuff like that. It was plain to see that Sam wasn't being rude or inefficient, there was just a silly misunderstanding. Sam was extremely embarrassed and asked me if he could make something \"special\" for me ... this was 5 minutes before closing time. He whipped together a feast.  I'll be honest, Sam saved what could have been a 1-star review and turned it into the 5-stars this place deserves.  Why 5-stars? First, fresh and high quality ingredients that are actually prepared to order. Second, cleanliness. Third, flavor. All Greek-style restaurants are NOT the same, everything at Gyro Point has a Mediterranean zip to it and when you consider the entire plate it's a flavor explosion in your mouth. And finally, Sam, who isn't just cruising by in life. He obviously works hard, is honest, and knows how to cook.  By the way, at most restaurants rice is basically just a cheap filler when served with a meal. I seriously could eat a bowl of the long-grain yellow saffron rice here and call it a meal. It's probably the best rice I've ever tasted!   You are missing out if you don't try this place"}
{"text":"I was having a massive pregnancy craving for Greek food on Friday & I remembered I saw this new place, so we decided to go there & we were not disappointed! My friends had never had Greek food before, now after we ate here, they were upset with themselves they had never adventured to try it before. We all had shawarma plates. I had the chicken & they had the beef. The Gyro Point's shawarma sauce is unlike  any I had tried before. The food was fresh, delicious & relatively quick. It's in a shopping center on the end & seemed to do a lot of take out business, although we stayed & ate. Not tremendously busy inside, but we were there in the last hour of operation & there were at least 3 take out orders while we were there. The only thing I would change is there wasn't any information regarding drinks, so my friends were unsure if they were able to get a refill on their drinks or not since the fountain is behind the counter. This is going to be a place we visit again for sure! I hope others find this treasure too."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go couldn't get the right meal two different times in a row. Food is just OK. Get your service right."}
