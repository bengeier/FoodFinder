{"text":"I was on my way to another restaurant in the area when the new sign caught my eye. I decided to give it a try since I liked the menu I saw outside. The service staff were attentive and friendly, and I was impressed with the quality of food. We got the fried rice, tonkotsu noodle, and fried chicken in sweet and sour sauce - we loved them all and it was one of the best dinners we had in awhile in the area.  I welcome this new joint in this neighborhood and I hope they do well! I'll definitely be returning again soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a warm noodle in this newly opened Korean/Chinese restaurant. Both my partner and I ordered a noodle dish (beef noodle for me and spicy noodles for her). My arrived promptly after 10 minutes of ordering. After an initial taste, the broth was lacking any genuine taste and the portion of meat/noodles was barely enough, in comparison to the noodle dishes I've tasted in many Korean restaurants as well as Japanese style ramen noodle restaurants. I wish the disappointment would end there; unfortunately, while I was trying this distasteful dish;  we were still waiting for my wife's dish to arrive. The part that struck me with annoyance was that another couple who had arrived 10 minutes after us got their dish (identical dish as to the one my wife ordered) first. Shortly after, I asked about the status of her dish. The waiter responded back that the kitchen was in a back log, even though the restaurant was around 50% capacity (with most tables already being served). Clearly, someone screwed up with the way the food went out. Instead of owning up to the mistake, I didn't appreciate the careless excuse. My recommendation is work better on the limited menu you have and own up to your faults."}
{"text":"I love this newly opened restaurant!! I don't usually try out the new restaurants, but i am happy i tried. I ordered fried rice with shrimp. It was super yum, and the portion was quite big. I liked their fried pork dish my friend ordered. I think the price is reasonable for a restaurant in this area. The staffs were super friendly. Highly recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolute favourite ramen place so far in toronto, Great food, Great Price, Good location, and amazing staff.  Being vegetarian kwok menu does an amazing job satisfing both meat eaters and vegetarians, each menu list has at least 2 vegetarian options.  Food: Amazingly flavourful, no msg and great sense of balance to the ramen experience, i ordered the veggie shoyu ramen and my heart skiped a beat the ramen was so good. Tender noodles with a salty deep flavoured broth. Even without meat the captured the escense of umami.    The avocado salad was strange, with vinegrate plated weirdly with bits of avocado. Im  THEY EVEN HAVE FRIED Chinese bun, served fresh drizzled with condensed milk was such a treat.  Staff: they provided a great experience,the restaurant has window and table seating but each table is equipef with a buzzer for quicker service. The staff regularly checked up on our food and made sure to notify me if the menu items fit my diet so it was nice they cared.  The location is wonderful just above wellsley, located  near a plaza, super accessible  Definatly reccomend my friends to go and i will return very soon!!"}
{"text":"FYI, a lot of people do not know that Koreanized Chinese restaurants do not serve the typical side dishes found in other Korean restaurants. In general, Korean-Chinese restaurants will serve yellow-pickled radish, onions (depending what's ordered), and kimchi.  This restaurants does lack the latter two, which is disappointing.  Food-wise, it's very good Korean-CHINESE food. Yep, a bit overpriced, but expected considering the expensive real estate.  If you're looking for \"regular\" Korean food (BBQ, stews, etc.), THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. Walk across the street to \"Miss Korea\" (same owner) for that."}
{"text":"If you know about Korean food, if you have tiny knowledge about Korean food, you won't go back to this place. Their item is 'Korean Style Chinese Food', but not actually Chinese. I know they tried their best, and I respect it. But most significantly, their food was not good."}
{"text":"Came here with my sisters for lunch. My sister had been here a few times already so was excited to have us try the place with her.  We ordered - sweet and sour pork - pork noodle soup - black bean noodle - beef noodle soup  They were all delicious! Good size portions, it was hard for us to finish all the food, so we had to take home some of it. Due to the fact that the noodles do get soft after the sauce and the soup goes in, the servers were concerned with the takeaway, as they were like, are you ok with it going soft...  it was great that they double check with you as they want to maintain the quality of their food.  My sister is a regular there and I will be back to try the other menu items..."}
{"text":"Really delicious food. Fun lively music environment. Korean food. Mostly Korean customers. Waiter spoke no English but super nice so it didn't matter. Will return!"}
{"text":"Ive been meaning to try this newly opened restaurant ever since passing by after it my gym sessions at Hone Fitness nearby. The noodle restaurant that was here before that wasn't very popular so I was hoping this new place would deserve the good location it is in. Unfortunately it didn't manage to impress me.   K-wok is mainly a Chinese restaurant with Korean twists to some of their dishes, and as a result you won't be served the traditional side dishes like in other Korean restaurants.   The main thing I wanted to try was their lamb skewers. They are my personal childhood favorites from the street food stalls in China, so I naturally gravitate towards them at any restaurant and have always wanted to taste and compare. However the worst thing a new customer can hear at a new restaurant is what they wanted to try wasn't available! The waitor said they don't have it yet. I'm not sure if it was because I came during lunch time and they didn't really prepare for the ingredients yet. In any case if it's on the menu it should always be available.   I ended up ordering just the Beef Noodle Soup, and oh man was this dish a dissappointment. The beef brisket was very dry, hard to chew, and tasteless, I managed to stomach it with the Sriracha and Hoisin sauce that came along on the side...but couldn't rely on it too much since the salty soup base adds to the saltiness of the sauces. My throat is craving water so much right now as I'm writing this review. The noodles were average at best, but given the dissappointment with the beef, I actually finished the noodles plain, and left more than half of the beef untouched by the time I asked for the bill.   There are other dishes on the menu that some have reviewed well, but after my first experience here I'm not sure if I would spend the money to give it a second chance again."}
