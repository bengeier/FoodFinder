{"text":"Nice environment with great service! 
Order a burger and a beer....really enjoyed the tater tots and the burger was Solid! 
Not much more I can say about this one. If you're in the area and want a cold beer and/or some food, give it a try! You won't be let-down!"}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetarian burger . . upon first bite almost threw up--as I have not consumed any poultry products in 8 YEARS!
Vegetarian burger returned then plastic cheese wrapper on last bite--"}
{"text":"I would say this place has the best wings that I have found in Phoenix. You can order them grilled so they're nice and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. They also have good french fries. That being said, every other food item we've tried here has been disgusting. The fried zucchini was the greasiest I've ever had anywhere. The fried mushrooms are coated with some weird crunchy cornmeal like substance that do nothing for them. I'm not sure what kind of beef they use but the hamburgers don't taste like meat. They have the texture and consistency of slime. The service is okay period sometimes you get great service and sometimes you don't. You can even be sitting at the bar and have crap service which I don't understand. We still order wings from here but we get them to go."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The atmosphere was old. Bartender lacked experience, service was slow, and food was barely edible. Wings were burnt and the other entre just had no flavor. Save your money."}
{"text":"Great place to relax after work or meet a group of friends for a fun evening!  The staff is very friendly and knowledge about the menu. 

We have been here numerous times and we are never disappointed. They will reserve an area if you are having a party (which we have done twice) and they even decorate if it is a birthday. We bring our children and grandchildren here for family get togetherness. Always comfortable. 

Oh...the wings are amazing! They will grill them after they are cooked and they come out super crispy and meaty. Their buffalo chicken sandwich is HUGE and cooked juicy with all the trimmings.

Can't go wrong at MVG!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite dive bars in the area.  I grew up at \"The Back Nine Bar & Grill\".  This is essentially that bar (same location & patrons) with an upgraded menu, staff, TV's, specials etc.  The drink are cheap and it's full of drunks from all over Moon Valley.  They are now open at 6:00 am for breakfast.  The food is pretty functional for what it is and as already mentioned you can't beat the price.  i would recommend it to drinkers and sports fans but not food enthusiasts."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood sports bar with food. We have been a few times, and are always pleased with the great service and food. The French Dip is my favorite, and they mix a pretty good Long Island Ice Tea. This is by no means a fancy, get dressed up establishment, but a warm, come as you are venue. Hope you enjoy."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here a few nights ago for dinner. The food was great and our server was very friendly. I have one complaint though. There was a young blond girl (she ran our food and was bussing tables) who was sitting on the counter by the kitchen. I believe this is the counter where the food is placed before bringing it to costumers. My husband and I kept looking over with disgusted looks, in hopes that she would get the point. After ten  minutes or so she put her leg and foot up on the counter as well. I don't know about you, but I surely don't want to be eating at a place where the employees are sitting on counters and having their feet up there also!Where was management to tell her that doing such a thing is a health hazard and inappropriate? I worked as a manager at a restaurant for 8 years and am unsure as to how that behavior is acceptable in a restaurant setting."}
{"text":"Fun neighborhood joint. Love the steak crustini."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat...the banter is worth it...not only between the servers but between customers. It was like everyone knew each other even though it was our first time there.

We went for lunch, I had chicken salad on marble rye...yah,,,,MARBLE rye in Arizona. Seriously, we've lived out here 30 years now and lemme tell ya, this was the best chicken salad I've had out here. The chicken was tender and chunky, celery and mayo all in the right proportions...this is rare...and I am an expert at chicken and tuna salad. 

As a side, instead of fries (boring), I opted for the potato soup...excellent! I dunno what to say...you just gotta try this.

Go for the food and the fun..not fancy...not at all expensive either.

Oh, next time we go, we sit at the counter...yah they got an olde timey counter :-)"}
{"text":"found are new hangout place.. my wife love the Pasta with grill chicken,garlic bread!!!!! there beers!!!!!!  I think the best wings in phx so far(Santinis bros still #1) !!! mild sauce double dip!!!
shit!!! I forgot.. u must try there steak sandwich!!! it's to die for!!! u must order it med.. full of flavor!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and so were all the people! Service was great and we have to thank Gary for the wonderful recommendations! She will not disappoint. And she was looking"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely pathetic!  This place is near my home, so I've tried multiple times over the course of the last 8-10 months hoping each time was just a bad experience.  I've finally realized the owner and manager(s) just don't care as the food is always bad.  Don't waste your money!!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers......bartender was horrible. I mean she needs to find a different line of work."}
{"text":"By far, of the best hand made burgers I've ever tasted. Went so well with some fries and a coke. Delicious, no lie."}
{"text":"Good, local option for a basic hang out to grab a drink with fiends, catch a game and grab some food.  The Turkey burger I tried was just right, and the french fries were, frankly, pretty damned amazing. Looks to be filled with a regular crowd of old-timers and some younger regulars. Staff was friendly and attentive. Give Moon Valley Grill a look."}
{"text":"The food is great! Be warned, it is a sports bar, but the food is oh so good and diverse!"}
{"text":"Best burgers ever! Friendly service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Not very good. Food was bland and uninspired. Boneless wings were cold. Nachos had a hair in them. Single waitress was nice enough but overworked. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm so torn.  I want to write a good review because they deserve it.  The food is always amazing (prime rib sliders, cobb salad, and the wings especially), the service and drinks are great, and the atmosphere is wonderful.

At the same time I enjoy having my little hole in the wall place that we go 1-2 times per week.  If you're in the area it's definitely worth trying!  The fried zucchini is a must-have for me.  We've been coming to this bar for about a year and it's on heavy rotation for weekly nights out."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the experience is constantly suffering due to the extremely poor service. This is an establishment I have visited for quite some time, after an obvious change of ownership in the last few years, this place lost its way. I want to be a fan, the close knit community atmophere is one of the high points of the establishment.  The last time I was in I tried a korean bbq chicken sandwich, me being the type to not leave food unfinished,  could not bring myself to finish the sandwich. The sauce tasted store bought and unpleasantly sweet to the point of being simply inedible.  With that being said the price point for what they serve and in that area is unreasonable to say the least. All in all,  I am always glad to support a local business and am glad to see them doing well, so I hope this place can learn to treat the people willing to spend the money a little better."}
{"text":"Moon Valley is an awesome place. Great local grill and the food is amazing. I highly recommend you stop by for a drink and a meal. The wings were incredible. Get the Sun Devil sauce. Sliders were also awesome! This is a great choice. Great service from Charlotte..."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and this is what I call a local neighborhood bar.  They have new TV's so watching the games over there is a blast.  The food is really good as well as super affordable.  If you are looking for a nice little bar to kick back at, look no further."}
{"text":"Really bad service. Had 3 different waiters and none of them could even be of any service. It shouldn't take 30+ minutes to get another drink. Blonde chick with the extremely rude!"}
{"text":"I love this place .....The grill is my cheers and will continue to be for the neighboring folks!! I love Catrina and Gary...Rogers the greatest..."}
{"text":"Decent prices. Great l food and happy hour is great. Burgers were awesome and my hubby had a grilled steak and mushroom with provolone on garlic toast!! This is our new spot and just down the street. They weren't busy and food was served fast and hot. Brittney was our server and she was great!! They have tvs inside for games and you an also see a big screen from the patio.. we did have to take home food. Pretty good portions.."}
{"text":"Definitely try this place. Catrina is great, as are all the bartenders and waitresses. The good is good and the service is spot on."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times my favorite and super good food. Really close to my work too actually next door neighbors. Love their cheese quesadillas so good."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money!  Inept staff, horrible service, and incredibly bad food!  Drive by on your way to The Lookout!  Moon Valley Grill needs to be put out of its misery!"}
{"text":"Shitty service at the bar. 1st time here with my friends for a husker game. Bartender had an attitude problem, saw us looking at the menu and didn't even ask if we wanted anything. I was a server for 8 years before I started my actual career so I know how it should go. Gave it 2 stars for cool atmosphere and decent draft selection...need a new bartender"}
{"text":"If you want a great tasting burger along with great service, this place has it!! Our waitress, Allyson, is AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much your typical strip mall sports bar. 

Wings are solid.  Burgers are decent.  Surprisingly, their salads, especially the steak salad, are really good.    Decent selection of beers.

Not enough televisions to show every NFL football game from the Sunday Ticket.  For college football, you will find a lot of Nebraska fans here."}
{"text":"Ended up a long way from home when we got hungry.  Spousal Unit had a vague memory of a sports bar \"somewhere\" along this street!  Stumbled in hungry and thirsty. Owner/bartender was great, friendly, good beer recommendation (Shocktop with an orange slice, yum!).  Knew her menu too!  \"Wings\" were more like small drummies, finished on the grill and very tasty!  Sweet potato fries are \"nice\" but the house fries or MVG fries (sourcream/onion added) were Outstanding!  French Dip was juicy, tasty beef layered endlessly on a ciabatta which held up very well to the generous serving of au-jus (I hate running out halfway through, not a problem here at MVG).  Definitely would go out of my way to show up again and sample a few more items.  Don't be surprised when you pull up or go in - no fancy schmancy decorations here, this place is like the plain looking girl in school who always wore a trenchcoat and no makeup - WHO KNEW she was rocking a super model bikini bod under that get-up?  Same At MVG, outside of the spiffy bathroom fixtures nobody is trying to dazzle you with decorations!  STAY ANYWAY!  If you are a smoker then you are in for a nice surprise - thats a nice little patio area hiding back there!"}
{"text":"My new favorite at the MV Grill is the Turkey Burger...best in town!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in Tuesday to watch some baseball. Our server was really friendly and helpful, I heard him mention he used to be a cook. Most cooks I've experienced aren't front of the house material, but he was great!

We had some half priced apps. The tortilla chips claim to be homemade but they tasted stale from a bag with cheap spinach and artichoke dip. The mushrooms were great and my salad was just as I expected. 

Depending what's on TV, I might be back but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"The food was actually really good . Nice service and pretty quick too. Nice spot to grab a bite of you live in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"The food at Moon Valley Grill is always rock solid. We usually go in for lunch and Julie provides superior service. She always remembers us & greets us with a smile.

My husband loves the Italian sub. I love the grilled cheese with tomato and the crinkle cut fries are fantastic! The boneless wings are great with a huge variety of sauces to choose from. The lunch specials are a great deal including a drink & cookie."}
{"text":"Staff... wonderful. Facility... great.  Beef Tacos on Taco Tuesday? Not so much.  Beef- no taco flavour in the meat - actually a taste of \"beef fat\" was all I picked up. Salsa was weak at best and sour cream was tick as paste. How do you mess up tacos?  Not a good experience. If I come back, may just stick to liquids."}
{"text":"Great local pub, owners know their business and their clientele.  Good place to have a meal and early on you can even bring the Kiddies, and watch some sports etc. 

I always feel welcomed on my own or with friends.  Perfect place to decompress from a long week.  Fun lively happy hour, and truly good food!"}
{"text":"Really great place for a drink and bar food. I know they have a great kitchen, Ive seen it, and a pretty good chef, there is a ton of imagination on the menu, but they could step it up a bit with regard to execution. Or not, its a bar and my guess is they are killing it!

The ambiance is perfect for sports on a crazy Saturday or a slow Sunday night. 

You cant go wrong here so stop in for a beer and some chicken strips!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say? Its your basic sports grill. Plenty of plasmas, large variety of alcohol, and a lot of old people. My first impression was a lively crowd but I soon realized how dull it was. Don't get me wrong, this place is excellent for group events but if you and some friends are looking for a night out, this is not the place. Standard beer prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner.  We were greeted promptly by our waitress who brought us drinks quickly.  We ordered the loaded potato skins appetizer which didn't come out until after our dinner had arrived because the kitchen had forgotten to send it out.  Potato skins were really good.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich which was ok - chicken was overcooked and rather dry.  My husband had a burger which he enjoyed.  Staff was really accommodating - Monday night football was about to start and I noticed the pregame was on one of the tv's in the bar so I asked if they could change the tv in front of us to that channel and they did it right away.  Once the game started they had all tv's on it and the sound playing in the whole place.  That was really cool but we didn't have time to sit and watch the whole game there.  Our waitress checked on us several times while we were eating to see if we needed anything.  Service was great, food decent.  We would come here again for sure."}
{"text":"We love Moon Valley- especially julie! Great neighborhood bar with lunch specials. Best BLT ever. Jorge makes mine with extra lettuce. Julie knows all the regulars and makes everyone feel welcome. I can only attribute the few bad reviews to a lack of sense of humor."}
{"text":"Love this place. My bf and i go here on Tuesdays for $2 Taco Tuesdays. The bartender remembers are drink and food order every week. Its a nice little neighborhood bar. Highly recommended it"}
{"text":"Great food, clean restaurant, and friendly staff, the prices were resonable and the portion sizes were good. Try the burger for lunch, or the omlettes for breakfast they are amazing."}
{"text":"4 of us ordered and everyone's food was delicious! I know because we all sampled one another dish!

I ordered the hot Italian sub and the wife got the pork sliders! Both were amazing! Boy ordered chicken Alfredo with broccoli and garlic bread and mom got the veggie wrap!

Highly recommend this little neighborhood joint to others! Clean and attentive! It's a Sun Devils and Corn Huskers joint so that's nice come football season for my ASU games! 

Go and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fun bar to spend the game at with friends or family.

Decent food, typical bar food variety.

Staff is outstanding, very clean and comfortable.

I will be a regular here!"}
{"text":"As you know this is a Nebraska Husker football bar. But since there's only 11 games a year the other 354 days are looking good. Service was good and atmosphere was sporty and nice. They have good sports bar food. 

They have fantastic wings.  We tried them with the Korean barbecue sauce. I had the steak sandwich on the garlic bread. It needs some sort of sauce or garlic butter on top of it. The onion rings on it are crispy and it is a great sandwich.  The patty melt could maybe use a little more onions and mushrooms but pretty solid. BLT is stacked high with bacon I would highly recommend spend in the one dollar more and getting a Friday got it. The potato salad on the side was outstanding."}
{"text":"We are Nebraska transplants and live near Moon Valley so this is an obvious choice for us. It's an amazingly fun time on Husker game days. We've been back several times. I would say the food is good, not great. Same for the service as there are a few delays at times. Only a couple craft beers on tap but at least one of them rotates. Do the shot-ski with friends, try the wings, and show up on a Nebraska football day to be amazed."}
{"text":"Good to have a nice neighbourhood bar like the MVG. I bought a condo in Moon Valley last year and as a guy who likes his beer and a good Happy Hour, was happy to stumble upon the MVG. This place is a regulars hang out; when most people walk in and sit at the bar I noticed a beer instantly brought to them. Service is attentive and staff are friendly. Great Happy Hour with low beer prices and half price appy's. Haven't eaten a lot here; still kinda new, but the grilled wings are great. Only 40 cents on Sunday and served with veggies and dip."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I'm home, I work out of town a lot, I come here for football and NCAA March Madness. Awesome food and great price. It's the perfect place to meet with your friends after work or on the weekend. The staff all know us, well mostly know my better half Jordan lol, and have our drinks ready to go right when we sit down. Great place."}
{"text":"Gotta love it, the best Husker bar in the Valley.   Buy the glass and the beer is $1.50 refills all season.   GO BIG RED!!!!    Good food, great people, great times."}
{"text":"The curry dishes were delish and staff/bartender very friendly! Enjoyed my experience there and will visit again!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: thank you Jennifer for reaching out with the apology and looking to fix it, we still do love MVG and always recommend your wings and drinks to all friends,family and coworkers . We get everyone has there off days ! We still do support our local businesses and will continue to do so . That right there shows they have good customer service and always wanna make sure there customers are well taken care of . 



Honestly we love moon valley grill and go at least once a week but after today not so much . The lady bartending really ruined it for us . I think she walked passed us about 10-15 times and didn't fill up our waters or ask us if we needed anything let alone ask me if I wanted another drink . She assumed we were done after not asking or filling up anything  and slapped a bill right Infront of us . We always recommend moon valley to friends , family and coworkers .:: so what happened to the great service ?the lady literally ignored us besides when we first walked in to take out order . I can handle slow service and waiting but what happened today with being ignored and stuff , someone should take care of that . Literally worst service EVER by you all"}
{"text":"Excellent menu. Angus burgers are huge, side portions are more than adequate. Good selection of beer and is served ice cold. To bad the patio is smoking area. Will definitely return as a fellow Husker fan. #GBR"}
{"text":"What a train wreck for customer service. Entered the building, waited more than 5 minutes at the bar to be asked if I wanted a drink. Once ask if I wanted anything. I sad yes. Beer, water. N menu. Beer n menu were asap. She came back n I ordered food and asked for water again. Then I sat for half a beer trying to get her attention but she was to busy eating her dinner to get me my water. Then she notices me tell the people next to me all I wanted was water. When I finally get the water after 3rd request I get attitude! What a train wreck! Just moved into the neighbor hood. Got to be honest won't ever come back to this piss poor customer service/attitude bar again. It's one thing to be nice and make a mistake- it's another to make the mistake 3 times and ack like its the customers fault. What a sh*t show!"}
{"text":"Moon Valley grill has the best burgers in town.  Casual atmosphere, great service - ask for Kyle- clean restaurant. Neighborhood bar and grill. Indoor wnd outdoor dining."}
{"text":"Second visit...
Had to bring Jeannie so she could try the wings. She and I have found our new favorite place for wings! Our favorite wings were the ones served at the ol'' Dirty Drummer. These are on par with those! Get the Sun Devil wings, hot and grilled. 

This is a typical neighborhood sports bar....and that is a good thing! Happy hour starts at 11am! What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Wifi password doesn't work and bartender won't find out why.

Bathroom smells like a sewer.

Why no outdoor TVs??"}
{"text":"They have good wings, especially their Jalapeño ones. My only complain is if you ask for them grilled they are still deep fried then put on the grill for the grill marks. Good service overall."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service!  Don't waste your money here!  Management has shown little desire to improve the poor service or improve the continual serving of cold food!"}
{"text":"I love the food there its so good the service is amazing I live there patio outside the restraunt waitresses are very friendly"}
{"text":"More like 3.75 stars.
4 stars for food
3.5 stars for service


The good: Super crispy wings. The boneless wings were really good too. Burgers good. I took kids during happy hour the first night of NFL preseason and the place was family friendly enough.

The needs to improve: Our server was a little disorganized and slow. Friendly enough when we saw her. If your chips and salsa really are \"house made\", I'd quit calling them house made. Chips and salsa kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"Great huge burgers and if you order a burger your 1st beer is only $1....also have one of the best breakfasts around."}
{"text":"Fantastic wings and french fries.  Decent beer selection.  The patrons are friendly and if a game is happening, it is on the tv.  I usually get fantastic attentive service here except for one time when my waiter never checked on my table."}
{"text":"I love this bar! This is the best bar food around. Love the sexy employees, Laine and Carrie. Ask for the special sauce."}
{"text":"Friendly service even though she brought me the wrong beer the first time. 
You should probably know the color of a shocktop does not match an amber ale if this is your job ( i'm just saying). :-)

Then, instead of allowing me the pleasure of  resolving her error and doing away with said evidence, she removed it and brought me the correct one. When she returned, I asked what happened to the other and she said it was dumped. WHAT??? One star for alcohol abuse!

Otherwise, good atmosphere and good food / drinks with decent prices.

Too bad about all the Huskers though. Go Badgers!"}
{"text":"The bartender denied my wife's valid government state issued ID because she didn't like me and the party I was with. Mind you I was with a funeral fundraiser party and the guy performing the music for the night. Horrible service. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food. Not the best food ever, but better than you would expect. 
 MVG is a dive bar no doubt. Plenty of menu choices. Big enough portions. Decent prices. Full bar with  basic domestic & foreign drafts. 
 Slow service needs to be addressed. Cleanliness of entire restaurant, especially bathrooms, is an issue. 
 I do not recommend making a special trip to Moon Valley Grill & probably won't go back. But, if you are there one day the food is fine."}
{"text":"Great service! Had a cold beer in my right hand the minute I walked through the door. Untapped potential at this place. Gary the server is a fox!"}
