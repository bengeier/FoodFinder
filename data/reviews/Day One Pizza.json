{"text":"We have ordered Day One Pizza a lot we usually just pick it up and take it home to eat. It's really good pizza but it's pretty pricey. When my husband went to pick up the pizza last night the workers we're sitting on the table playing cards lol, not to sure about that! They are all very nice there though and like I said pizza is good!"}
{"text":"We love Day One!   The pizza is 100% fresh, toppings are plentiful, and the service is very friendly.  Day One works VERY hard to accommodate diners with food allergies.  Once you  mention an allergy, they immediately call on a manager to handle your order.  They will clean (although they already look very clean) your table and chairs to avoid any residue that might cause an allergic reaction.  They provide gluten free pizza crusts, too.  The Day One owners are very supportive of the community.  This store isn't a franchise or a chain -- it is owner-operated, and it shows in their pride in their product.  Yes, you can buy cheaper pizza, but with Day One you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Here's why Day One has better food: 1) Pepperoni and other toppings are under the cheese, so they don't dry out in the oven. 2) The crust actually tastes good, not like cardboard. 3) It's always served by incredibly nice people. 4) It's a true local business, not a big box chain. I especially like the feta spinach pizza and the cinnamon twist breadsticks."}
{"text":"Very good. Well above average. We had takeout which never tastes as good as fresh at any restaurant so I'll be curious to check them out fresh next time. Staff was extremely helpful on phone and at pickup."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest and most attentive restaurant in Sun Prairie.  We love the cheese bread, BLT and Columbus salad. Give this place a try, it's more than just pizza."}
{"text":"This is an amazing pizza place. Living in the Sun Prairie area, we order from there ALL the time (so much so that several employees know my kids' names and ages, and always ask after them, ha!) Granted, it's not some artsy, fancy pizza like Grampa's Pizza in Madison (which I also love!); Day One is just your typical cheese, pepperoni, sausage place. But it is SO good! Ingredients are always fresh, employees are friendly, store is immaculate, and it's reasonably priced. We usually order a regular crust pizza, half cheese, half sausage, which sounds probably kind of plain, but it's our typical Friday night meal; so good!  My only complaint about them (hint, hint, if any managers are reading!) is that unlike other pizza places, they don't have a system where you just give your phone number and they pull up all your information. So every single time, I have to give our address, spell out our last name, etc. It'd be so much easier if I could just say, \"yes, my phone number is 555-555-5555\" and have them pull up all the info. But, that's a minor complaint and obviously doesn't deter me from ordering from them quite often."}
{"text":"Great pizza !  I think this place is a hidden treasure. Staff are so friendly and the place is spotless. I like it better than el Salvatore's!"}
{"text":"Service is great, price is too high, pizza is ok at best, toppings lacking. There are 3 really good things about the place which are the service, specialty pizzas, and the bread sticks if you don't mind paying over $20 for a 12\" and an order of the bread sticks. Overall there is better pizza elsewhere in Sun Prairie for the same price."}
{"text":"A while ago I saw a coupon in the local paper for $5 off any size mac-n-cheese pizza at Day One. I like this sort of pizza (I also like circus peanuts, go ahead and judge).   I called ahead for pickup. It was really loud and busy on the other end, so I sort of wondered how chaotic it would be when I went to get my food. Turns out, it was completely uneventful. There was a handful of girls having a birthday party or something and a bunch of employees tucked around a corner. I got my pizza right away, the coupon worked fine (you never know), and was out of there inside of five minutes.   The pizza was good. I got the thicker crust which still isn't strong enough to hold up a LOT of macaroni and cheese. It was filling: my 11-year-old (an eating machine on weekends) only managed two slices. It was definitely better than Pizza Pit but without the coupon would've been a little steep. It's a local chain, though, which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Really friendly owner - who is rather visible in the Sun Prairie community - and I love their garlic chicken alfredo pizza that is on special on Fridays.  The name has to do with \"Day One\" being a post-Y2K named theme for their restaurant.   Think global, buy pizza local."}
{"text":"Oh me, oh my!  This pizza is good!  Really good and expensive!  Price wise they are up there with the likes of Anna's.  However, I think you do get more food for the money here.  Customer service is good too, unlike the zombie employees at Pizza Hut, Domino's, Caesars etc.    During the Flags of Freedom parade they had a vehicle that drove by as some of the employees handed out free stuff, and the lady driving yells to me \"we really are the best pizza in town!\"  I don't think she was lying.  While Anna's rocks my world, Day One has more options AND they take a debit card.  I'm thinking these things give them the edge."}
{"text":"We ordered from Day One Pizza during a football game. We got a Columbus salad, Chicken Wings, and a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. All of the food was good, not great. We have no complaints, but weren't blown away.  We were also bummed that they don't have buffalo wings, only honey glazed bbq wings that were a little too sweet for our taste. The BBQ chicken pizza was pretty good, but I don't know if it was worth the price.  Sun Prairie has better pizza places."}
{"text":"Day One is my favorite place to get pizza in Sun Prairie. The pizza is good and they do a bunch to support the community - especially the schools. The only topping they're missing is jalape√±os."}
{"text":"It's decent pizza, but it's a little more expensive than your average pie place. They're serving stuff that's a step or two better than Little Caesar's and charging four times the price.   Service is solid.  Atmophere is nice."}
{"text":"Day-One pizza is amazing! Prices are a little high but the taste usually makes up for it. Besides their amazing pizza, I also frequently go for their honey mustard chicken sandwich which is quite good. I'm not the biggest fan of their mac n cheese pizza (Ians is better) but their regular cheese, sausage, pepperoni is spot on. They frequently reach out to help the community and give discounts to teachers when they order pizza for classes. I've never eaten in their actual resturant before, I always have the food delivered although I have gone in to pick it up a couple times and the eating area- although fairly small- looks nice if you're just stopping in to have a slice for lunch."}
