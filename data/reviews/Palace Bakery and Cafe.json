{"text":"I go here all the time! Very welcoming and friendly customer service. The food is very cheap and affordable although the classic bubble tea flavours are a bit more pricier compared to some of the other shops I've been to. The food is tasty and totally worth it though! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a great little bakery with perhaps the best egg tarts in Richmond Hill.  I usually come here if I'm visiting family or friends.  Also if I'm around the corner for dim sum.  The owners are very nice and always mention the specials they have available.   I usually get the chinese milk tea and egg tart combo, probably the best $3 you'll spend.  The egg tarts are nice and the tart portion crumbles nicely.  They aren't too sweet or bland like other bakeries in the area.  Their other pastries are great as well and very well priced.  There are various specials throughout the store as well, depending on how many buns you buy or if you want drinks as well.  I always make sure to come back here when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Service was surprisingly friendly. I especially enjoy their tuna buns and chicken pies. I've been getting my Hong Kong style buns from here since childhood (usually after my parents go grocery shopping). Great place!"}
{"text":"Super friendly owner and service. I love their birthday cakes! Make sure you order them ahead though. The buns are delicious and soft."}
{"text":"Friendly service, decent Hong Kong style buns, decent Hong Kong style milk tea. Plenty of seats are available. It will be a nice cafe to hang around in the neighbourhood.   I went there around 4PM, most of the shelfs were empty. I guess you need to go earlier for more selection."}
{"text":"Friendly Asian bakery! The owner is extremely nice and talkative! Their buns are very fresh and the egg tarts are delicious!   They also have many drinks and a small Asian cafe menu. Their drink selection is limited and are a tad bit more pricier than other places but they are still good and worth the try.  For the egg tarts it's best to go in the mornings when they are fresh... They normally run out of them by mid afternoon."}
{"text":"Love the service at this Bakery - the owners here are always ready with a smile, and recommendations for you. My favourite are the eggs tarts, which come in both the flakey crust and the cookie crust...but that flakey crust is just phenomenal, with a rich buttery taste.  It's got a nice little sitting area too, so perfect to grab an HK milk tea and eat your egg tart fresh!   Prices are great - nice and cheap, a delish light breakfast or snack under $5."}
{"text":"Whenever I go Emperor for dim sum or dinner, I always walk by Palace Bakery and Cafe.   From outside, Palace looks kind of sketchy, but inside is just clean, tidy and very welcoming! Tons of seating if you want to just chill out and enjoy a snack and listen to oldies..  A lot of special sets with choices of buns, sandwiches, noodles and even rice dishes. The pastries and buns are all individually wrapped so really hygienic compare to other Chinese bakeries I been to! Choices might be limited but all seems to be nicely prepared!  Egg Tarts fresh from the oven with a small milk tea ($2.20) definitely A-OK. The egg tart has such a flaky buttery crust with really light and jiggly egg custard filling is just delicious!  Milk tea though a little meh wish it it more creamy and silky!  A lot of locals in the neighbourhoods seems to frequent Palace and the staffs/owners are just really friendly and chatty!  I definitely will be back to Palace again..."}
{"text":"Came here little past 3pm. Not many choices left.  The egg white cake was good. Soft n not too sweet but not impressive. Spacious sitting area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhood foodstop, Palace Bakery & Cafe, is a delightfully friendly and quiet hang-out every weekend.  My kids call it \"the bun shop!!!\" and would excitedly go there for a quick snack.  Those big, soft, and tasteful buns alongwith their favorite Kool-Aid is a filling treat for these spuds while I enjoy a piece with tea or coffee.  A bright and spacious place with some whimsical and homey decors, and the wide selection of bakery items right within my reach makes it heartening to stay and enjoy a a few minutes of serenity.  The baker and owner of this dainty and sweet place are cheerful fellas who warmly greets all their clients.  A lot of regular customers would swing by for a bag of buns or boxes of pre-ordered cakes and everytime would share a few moments of chat with him.  I suppose the entire neighborhood is keen to this place because of this neighborly candor and of course the sweet buns and pastries that are just great anytime of the day.  Their buns are good baked with various kinds of filling and toppings of sweet delicate custards, saucy meat, sweet fruits and nuts leaning to a more Asian palette.  A meal in itself or a quick filler, its a great alternative to donuts and muffins.  They`ve also got a wide array of pastries, puff pastries, and cookies which we can pick out from the shelves ourselves.  One of my favorite treats which I serve my friends are the tarts: egg, chicken, and cookie crusted.    One of their any day fresh goodness are the 6 inch cakes that look so dainty and sweet topped with dark and white chocolate shavings, fresh fruits, and swirls of sweetness only the keenest bakers would know it by name.  And their fridge is usually loaded with boxes of special occasion cakes every weekend.  People would also come in for hot meals and sandwiches.  It would seem their soup is very popular since I often chance upon folks sitting in the dining area enjoying it with a fat piece of bread on the side and a cup of tea.  Its so amusing remembering that one day I was sitting with a cup of coffee and a blueberry custard bun between my teeth, a man rushed in and asked the owner about the soup this lady he saw was carrying out and that it smelled so good and would like a serving of it.  Sounded like it really made him very hungry that cold lunch hour.  He sat at the table next to me and seemed completely satisfied.  They have an operating bakery and kitchen and bakes all these good stuff on site.  Some people might remember this place as Queens Patisserie which franchises are located around the city.  But a couple of years ago, I think, they changed it to Palace Bakery & Cafe and Queens Patisserie became a bakery section in the next door Asian grocery, Bayview Foodmart.  But setting that aside, they continue to bake and fill the shopping and dining strip with the aroma of freshly baked goods.  The best time to go here would be in the morning because usually by afternoon the baskets on the shelves would be pretty empty already.  Don't settle for this review, see more from my blog at www.ninasy.com/?p=695.  Yeah, its a year old but still fresh & hot.  :D"}
