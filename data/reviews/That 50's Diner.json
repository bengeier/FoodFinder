{"text":"Disappointing. The salt, pepper and sugar containers were filthy. I ordered the Eggs Benedict which looked and tasted more like eggs with mayonnaise spread over. The home fries were extremely greasy."}
{"text":"I am always a fan of local diners, and this is one of them. Recently refreshed and renovated, \"That 50's Diner\" gives you great breakfast or brunch without breaking your bank. The owners serve you with a smile (one serves you in front and the other one cooks for you). I like their interior too!

They have a great menu that consists of yummy sandwiches and all-day-breakfast. Try their grilled sandwiches or their eggs benedict (my favorite). Your belly and wallet will thank you!"}
{"text":"Took the kids here on a Sunday for their breakfast specials.  They had a sign outside advertizing these specials.  It said on the sign \"breakfast 7 days a week\" or something to that effect.  After looking at the menu and talking to the waitress, she confirmed that those specials are only monday to friday as stated on the menu.  The sign outside didnt mention anything about that yet they still put it out on weekends.  This is a very misleading sign.  I calmy talked to the waitresses about it by the cash register.  I told them that they should either honour the prices on the sign or remove it as it was false advertizing.  They didnt really have anything to say other than the fact that it says it is a monday to friday special according to the menu.  Then the boss came out from behind the counter and rudely accused me of yelling at his staff.  I told him that i wasnt yelling and the waitress confirmed that.  Even still, the boss was carrying on like an idiot and at that point I started making a scene.  Hell, if he's going to accuse me of it, i might as well do it. To make a long story short, we left and will never be returning.  Horrible service and misleading signs to lure the custermers in with false promises.  I would give only a half star but yelp wouldnt let me"}
{"text":"Lousy food and service this trip. Used to be a fantastic breakfast spot but since changed ownership it has really gone down hill.
Recommend you skip this one."}
{"text":"My friend brought me to the diner because we weren't able to get a seat at the Sunset Grill in Ajax. Having received zero customer service at Sunset Grill Restaurant in Ajax (read review on Sunset Grill for full story), we were extremely happy to be greeted at the door by the friendly wait staff. We arrived around 1pm and the restaurant was full. The friendly waitress told us that it would be a 5-10 min wait and sure enough we were seated in less than 10 minutes. They have a full breakfast menu as well as different sandwiches and lunch items. The breakfast is huge and delicious. The service was excellent, our cups were never empty. I would definitely return the next time I'm in Pickering. 

They have breakfast specials before 11am for under $5 Monday-Friday."}
{"text":"Food was OK. The seating sorts sucks because the benches are old and uncomfortable. I brought my toddler son with us and their high chair didn't have a seat belt. Made for a tough breakfast. I told the manager and even called back every week for 3 weeks to see if they fixed it yet so we could come again and the answer was always no, so I stopped calling. Overall the place was good, but sad they didn't listen to their customers complaint."}
{"text":"Twas good.  There was a group of 4, the work group,  I had the roast beef dip and fries and found it rather enjoyable as a comfort food.  Since we had our order as takeout, we didnt have much interaction with the staff but all commented that they were pleasant and friendly.  We all enjoyed the various meals, the chicken wrap, garlic bread, 10 oz burger, and chicken breast combo.  As far as a family style meal goes, or a lunch place, i think we will be back.  They just seem so easy to deal with, and when you are on the run, its all good.  Best part is our order was ready when we got there.  So time wise this was a huge plus, not having to wait around.  They even made sure there was enough napkins and condiments.  I think i need to try them for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Went there the other day. Sign said open. We walked in and a female employee looked at us, then at a clock. Not even a hello. She told us they were closed. It was 3:20. The sign on the door said they were open until 4. Why not turn the \"open\" sign off then? Very rude and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"This place has changed so much! use to be good... last time I was there, my meal was cold and service was not great"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but nothing to write home about.  Decent club sandwich, but no better or worse than anywhere else.  Service inconsistent.  We waited for ten minutes before they brought a menu.  \"Sorry, I didn't see you\" and \"I thought someone else brought the menu.\"  Took ages to get the bill as well.  Not the worst, but not worth making a special trip for."}
{"text":"Great homemade food in real old fashioned dinner. They play oldies music, and have booths, and pictures on the walls of Elvis, it's the real deal! 

The staff is friendly, the prices are good and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast in Pickering!  Service is always friendly, food is good, staff/owners are really great.  Cute 60s style ambience with good music and a juke box."}
{"text":"Dropped in for breakfast but was underwhelmed.

While not horrible everything was a bit off and had an odd greasy flavour from whatever oil they are using to cook things.

Service was very good, just didnt enjoy the meal an likley wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"If you live in Pickering, this is a pretty good breakfast place - food is pretty good but the atmosphere is what really makes this a go to place. If you've got kids, they'll be won over by the juke box at each table and delicious shakes. Pancakes are pretty yummy too :)"}
{"text":"The food was just OK. Everything seems very basic. The servers are also not very welcoming and like another review said, they seem like they're doing me a favor. Not the typical service you'd expect to get at a diner. Some things were quite pricey too. I wanted a side of bacon, it was $3 for 4 slices...

I prefer Wimpy's Diners. The food is good and staff is always friendly!"}
