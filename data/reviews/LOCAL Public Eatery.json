{"text":"I would go four stars but....  We love this place because of the upstairs dining area where no one under 19 is permitted (as your sign indicates).  The food is very good and all of your servers/staff are great.  But  last weekend there were children (under the age of 7) allowed in this area of the restaurant.  We asked about this and were told on the weekends, during brunch, this was now allowed by management.   The sign, when you enter, definitely states no none under the age of 19 is allowed upstairs.  My friend thought it was one of your servers who was hosting the brunch so maybe this is why it was allowed.  If this is not the case,then you need to amend the sign to advise people that, on weekends, patrons under the age of 19 are permitted.   One of the reasons we go to your restaurant is to avoid the noise and disturbance of children.   We hope this was just a one off because it will definitely deter us and our friends from going on the weekend."}
{"text":"The nachos were amazing , the sauce was different with a spicy twist. The veggie burger was fresh and yummy"}
{"text":"Always packed when I pass by around noon, this is definitely a popular lunch spot in Liberty Village. I have come here a few times now, trying out their Brooklyn burger, crispy chicken sandwich and tuna club sandwich. When they first opened, me and my colleagues all thought the food was on the salty side, but it seems like they have rectified that problem. The burger is satisfying, both in taste and size, but nothing too special. Their crispy chicken sandwich is the better choice in my opinion. It features a large piece of crunchy skinned chicken and makes for a pretty filling lunch. Once I put the top bun over the chicken, I was looking at a super tall sandwich that I didn't even know how to tackle at first. During my most recent trip I had the tuna club sandwich and thought that it was pretty good too. It features a chunk of seared tuna, slices of avocado, bacon and melted cheddar cheese. Although it got pretty messy with mayo oozing out of the sandwich, I quite enjoyed the combination of ingredients. The space itself is great and has some interesting features, such as a large flip board that scrolls through their beer menu and a wall of speakers. Lots of TV screens throughout the place too. This place has become a good option for eating out for lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Normally wouldn't expect to be such a fan of a chain restaurant but I really dug the vibe in Local!  We were there Wednesday night for a bite and drinks with friends. We sat inside as it was very busy and we took what we could get, but it was probably better given how hot and muggy it was outside. Downside of eating in is that it's very loud in there but they were playing the Jays game so the place was packed - not the place for an intimate date or group dinner.  They get 4/5 stars because the beer was cheap! Drink specials every night and Wednesday's were $4 14oz Steamwhistle. I also had 2 fish tacos, I had done my Yelp research and you didn't let me down. They were awesome! Competes with Grand Electric, a nice portion of fish, some kind of crema, and a lot of finely shredded cabbage - my favourite part. Topped with pico and cilantro, hot sauce on the side. I could have had two more!   Ended the meal by sharing s'mores churros. They were pretty delicious, must be eaten right away. I'm not a huge sweet fan but for $5 it was a nice portion to share!  Glad I don't live in Liberty but I'll walk there for this spot. We'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my Fav Stephen ave eats n drinks   Great Staff - Great food - almost everything they serve is awesome -  But I have to complain who the heck takes a picture of a giant Jug of sangria and not mention it. That should be a crime because 1. now i want to go get a giant jug of sangria with not knowing if its any good  2. that's just a jerk move  YUP this place rocks!"}
{"text":"A very neat mix of people in here. I really enjoyed myself. The place is relaxed and has an easy going vibe. The staff were all really nice and helpful. Had a couple drinks they were all made very well.   Tables can be a bit hard to come by. Over all it's a great place to come with a group or with one other person. The noise level wasn't too bad either. Service was prompt. The only thing I didn't like was the bathrooms in the basement. They were clean but a little too dark and creepy for me. Anyway not a big deal."}
{"text":"Came here with two girlfriends last night. We arrived at 7, and got a table at 7:40. But my one friend wanted to sit down for the hockey game, so we waited with her.  We got our seats, and our waitress was with us shortly. We got the pitcher of sangria, and were given waters. The sangria was good, very red wine-y. We ordered nachos to share. The chips looked to be house fried, though I could be wrong. They were good. There were black beans, black olives, cheese, jalape√±os, pulled chicken, and sour cream on ours. We opted out of onions and salsa.   A while later, we had a few more drinks and finally ordered our main meals. I will first comment on the mojito. It should really be served in a highball glass. I got one oz. of alcohol in a pint glass, there was just far too much liquid, I didn't even finish it. I then opted to get the $4.50 surprise wine deal. It's a great concept, and probably a good way to get rid of half-opened bottles.   My dinner, I got the spicy, fried chicken sandwich with fries. The fries were limp and cold, but there were lots of them. They had a small amount of ketchup on the side, which may not be enough if the fries were warm and I wanted to eat more than the few I did. But my sandwich.... The batter on the chicken immediately fell to bits. It was flaking all over and actually caused me to drop my sandwich a few times. It was just really messy. The slaw and pickles were great. But the sandwich issue inevitably gave the 3-star rating... the creme de la creme fell sour."}
{"text":"Love it here! My go to place for good food and inexpensive drinks. I live in the area so it's very convenient for a nice dinner out.  It's quite difficult to get a seat on a busy night though but it's worth the wait.  Fish tacos and ahi tuna chopped salad are my top choices! Press Burgers are great too"}
{"text":"Sangria was delicious! We sat at the beautiful outdoor bar.  Service was good and food was tasty and well priced.  A spot to check out in Leaside!"}
{"text":"First time here - Friday night of August long weekend.  Yes, we had to succumb to the dreaded waiting list but within 15 minutes we were seated (they don't call you on your cell by the way, so you have to hang around the entrance and make sure you're still in the hostess' line of sight).  Food: We did a bunch of share plates. Here is the full recap: Items my husband and I are still talking about: baja fish tacos (so crispy!); sliders (moist mini burger, semi sweet egg-y mini bun, 'american cheese', homemade potato chips...a bit reminiscent of McDonald's but in a totally awesome way).  Items we will bypass the next time (because there will be a next time): crispy pork belly on scallion pancakes - flavours were all there but we need a microscope to find the pork belly.  It was sad. Items that our neighbouring tables had that we want to try next time: fish & chips, yam frites, big-ass protein salads...the opportunities are endless.  Drinks:  We both went for the $4.50 'mystery wine' - available in white or red.  I went white and was pleasantly surprised (not too dry, not too sweet...), while my husband went for the mystery red.  He drinks Fuzion at home, so of course he was happy.  Service: Yes, they're totally busy and yes, they are still getting their sea legs but overall they totally meant well.  (e.g., I had to wait a bit for my wine, so it ended up being on the house).  Also, I think they are more popular than they expected as they were out of a lot of items (2 items on the wine list, 2 items on the food list - there was probably more).  We live down the block - this is a great addition to LV.  Brazen Head and Williams Landing, although they both have better patios, should be worried about this new kid in town."}
{"text":"I was there on a Wednesday night. It's fairly packed. Ordered Brooklyn burger with yam fries and Fish & Chips. Both of them were DELICIOUS. Great service by our friendly server. Love the food and vibe of this place.   Will be Back :)"}
{"text":"If cheap is what you are into, this is the spot for you. They seem to give away their food and drink in order to fill the place. It is busy and some dishes are decent. They do lack that chef, homemade, give a s@&t feel that some of us still look for. The service is hit or miss. Last time I was in the server told us how little money she made (not something I care to hear). I'll leave local for those interested in what it offers, just not for me."}
{"text":"Eight of us went to Local last night to celebrate a friends birthday. We are all regulars as we live in the neighbourhood and often take advantage of their $4 mystery wines and beer specials. Unfortunately that will be my last visit.  A waiter passing behind me dropped a bowl or plate with ketchup on it which covered my back, as well as my coat and scarf hanging on the back of my chair.The waiter kept apologizing, brought those crappy brown paper towels. I asked for a wet cloth and a bag to put my scarf in, which of course never arrived, and he said he would get the manager. He asked what he could do and I said I think it's reasonable that you, at the minimum, comp my drinks. He just looked at me, kind of bug eyed and didn't respond.    When the waitress brought me a bill at the end of the night, I said \"You have got to be kidding me\". She was completely oblivious to the whole incident so it shows what kind of attention she was actually paying to us. I asked her to get the manager. He sat down and said I hope you received good service this evening, (well it wasn't exactly stellar) because that is all I can give to you. I said that was not acceptable and he said we will be providing no compensation because it was an accident. I told him it was a service industry and most organizations would ensure they made it right for a waiter spilling on a customer. Then of course I apologized to the waitress and said I couldn't tip her and she became argumentative with me. Unfortuantely that's the nature of the business. If the food is crappy, you can't take it out of the chef's tip. Sorry - take it up with your manager. Andre was his name and I am guessing his career in the service industry will be short-lived as he clearly did not consider the exponential effect on Local.  Eight women with spouses and about 20 university aged kids between us who will now boycott the place. Conservatively our table spent $250, my bill being $25. Assuming a 100% mark-up on alcohol, my beverage cost to them was $12.50. If each of our families visited once monthly and spent $100, then with slight rounding, they have lost $10,000 in revenues annually from our group alone. Not to mention all the other friends and neighbours we will be relaying this incident too. Hmmmm, should I make it right, or basically flip them the bird?"}
{"text":"Love local. The second day they were open my boyfriend and I received free nachos and a couple of free beers just for tweeting at them.  The food is great, I recently had the fish tacos and they were sooo good! A bonus for me is that they ask if you like cilantro (I am not a fan) so it made them that much better.  They have real deals on booze, a super awesome atmosphere AND an awesome place to keep your pooch (which shows that they actually took their time to know the community).   They're killin it."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for lunch on a Sunday before a TFC game and couldn't be happier.   Fried calamari appetizer was perfect. Then we both had Brooklyn Burgers for lunch which had this amazing red pepper relish on it. Fries were also deliciously.   Wait staff was incredibly pleasant and efficient in what was a packed house."}
{"text":"The Local has the best nachos I've ever eaten! The bean and cilantro combo was super tasty and there weren't any weird dry layers with no cheese or veggies. They played great music and the volume was at a decent level. The ambiance was dark and cool, and the open kitchen was inviting with warm delicious fresh cooked food smells wafting from it. Our waitress was always on top of our drinks - which we definitely took advantage of the $3.50 pints special :p I will definitely be going back there. I believe there is a Local Public Eatery in south Edmonton..."}
{"text":"This bar offers a great spot for friends in the heart of Liberty Village! Although the place was packed we were immediately greeted by the usher who suggested to sit at the bar and what a suggestion it was. The bartenders were some of the friendliest I've ever seen! They were quick to serve and took the time to ask our names and introduce themselves. I felt immediately welcomed. The decor was also impressive. A mix of modern and rustic chic offered a great venue. High definition TVs in view no matter where you sit are a big plus for big sports event nights. The drink menu offered great specials every day of the week while the food selection was limited but still good for snacking while you drink."}
{"text":"Great! Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Had the tomato and avocado eggs benedict.  It was delicious! Eggs were a little overdone but not enough to ruin the meal.  The patio is great and I cannot wait for them to open up the extra seating"}
{"text":"Had brunch on October 30 before Tfc game. Wasn't full and we were seated right away. I had the steak sandwich, asked for it medium well. It was still bleeding - gross. My son had fish and chips. The fries were cold and the fish mushy.  Hope three brewers opens up in Liberty Village soon or go to Williams Landing - the couple of times we were there it was great. Also if the server had smiled it might have helped a little."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food priced reasonably. Fun place to enjoy some drinks with friends. Service friendly and good. Love that they serve local beer! Cudos!"}
{"text":"spicy wings were sub-par, atmosphere is great, crowd is very local, young, hip, professionals. Service is attentive, but a little amateurish, I guess it depends on who is your server, probably high turnover in wait staff.  had the Churro dessert, probably one of the best churro in town!  I was surprised how good the Churro was after eating so many churros from harbourfront and Kensington market.  It comes with a chocolate marshmallow dip, but this dip isn't necessary, as the Churro was just done so well... I mean, it shouldn't be hard to make churros, but this place does it well.  I need to come back and try more on their menu, only been here once and had the Churro and wings.  Beer and coffee.  4 stars for atmosphere, decor, value. 3 stars for service 2 stars for wings 5 stars for their churros"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun in here... However the food was so salty it was unbearable. The nachos were terrible with no cheese and only black beans heaps in piles on the top. Come here for drinks but don't expect decent food."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, the food is surprisingly decent and well priced. Service is fun and competent, and the patio is great in the summer. A great local (heh) spot to grab some a burger and a beer. Wings are the real deal -- authentic Buffalo sauce -- but are on the small side."}
{"text":"Great new spot in Leaside! Service was excellent and so was the food. Fish and chips was tasty with a light batter and good fish, hamburger was delicious. Get the teriyaki Edamame - sweet and spicy and impossible to eat just one."}
{"text":"Bad bad not good. Slow service. Cold food. Wouldn't recommend to families, singles, couples, youth, adults, swingers, church-goers, parents, children, brothers, sisters or most humans. Perfect for someone on death row waiting for their last meal, as it will take forever.   But, once the food came, it was tasty."}
{"text":"Thought it would be a good place to eat for lunch.  Got to the bar, felt it took a while to get a beer.  I had the tuna club.  I liked the creativity of seared ahi tuna,  but it was barely seared looked pretty much raw and was cold to the touch.  Avocado chunks, made the sandwich hard to hold together.  Bread for the sandwich was really good, fries were cold.  Gravy amazing.    Like the sapporo on tap, but stuffy in there.    Do not recommend but if u do - get the gravy!"}
{"text":"best fish tacos!!!  must order!!!!  pairs wonderful with riesling wine.  delish!"}
{"text":"Hipster vibe, not the quickest service but at least the staff is friendly! The fish tacos are tasty if you like your slaw and the hippie toast is a fine, small appetizer. I hear the chicken sandwich is delicious although I haven't had it myself."}
{"text":"Busy spot so far so be prepared to wait most times throughout the day. Arrived here with friends and had to wait a bit at the bar before we were seated inside. The staff is friendly and helpful but you can tell it is a new spot (only open 2 weeks) and they are still working out a few organizational hiccups (took a bit until a waitress finally came over and there were troubles with switching our bar tabs over to our table).   Portion sizes and food were excellent for the value. We look forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"I love the fish tacos here...actually i'm kind of addicted to because I always crave it. I prefer to have it without the cilantro because it's kind of over powering. The batter on the fish is perfect! It's light, crispy and not greasy. The tuna poke is okay sometimes it's too salty. The burgers look amazing but it was just okay. The rest of the menu looks good but I've never tried it yet because of the darn fish tacos! The service is pretty fast and I will be done lunch in less than an hour."}
{"text":"It's got so much potential. Pretty good food, the burger is ok (not the best in the city by far, but not terrible). The guac is super fresh. Nachos are delicious. They have great daily specials on good beers.   The main issue is the noise. It's insanely loud for dinner. You have to yell loudly to people sitting directly beside you, and forget about talking to someone across from you. They have this board on the wall that clacks numbers, it's cool for a second till you realize how much sound it's adding. The ceilings are high up, and everything is wood or metal, so the sound just bounces around like crazy. Doesn't help that bartenders and servers yell at each other across the restaurant either, but I suppose they have to yell either way. If you want good food in a club-like atmosphere, then this is the spot. Otherwise, the other 3 bars in liberty are better for not going deaf."}
{"text":"Great spot for young professionals to grab a beer and relax.    The space itself is excellent.  We were able to be seated in a booth without any wait!  The staff was awesome (Brooke was our waitress) and the food was quick to arrive. The pulled pork poutine was great, but I do wish there was a more pulled pork.  To be honest, there was very little of it.    The only other critique would be to add an organic beer option, but that's a small thing when considering the overall experience.   Food: -pulled pork poutine -calamari -churros    Drinks: -shock top - JD Lemonade (?)   Time of visit:  10:00pm"}
{"text":"Strolling into LOCAL at about 2:30pm on a Friday, we were welcomed by the chatter of an energetic male-dominated crowd of young businesspeople getting a head start on their weekend. Some were crowding around a game of shuffleboard, others conversing loudly at their tables surrounded by the many TV's that line LOCAL's walls. After a quick tour of the premises, we seated ourselves at one of the few available tables at the back of the restaurant.  The menus were already on the table, printed on worn brochure-style leaflets. Opting for the daily wine feature (a 6 oz. glass of unnamed Cab-Sauv for $8), I soon found myself sipping on a good vino and debating between LOCAL's burgers and Baja tacos. (Every day of the week has a couple of beer and wine specials, with Mondays and Tuesdays giving the best bang for your buck.)  While nibbling on some delicious Spicy Edemame that my friends ordered, I decided on a couple of Baja Chicken Tacos and one Baja Fish Tacos ($4.50 each). The tacos were served on medium-sized flour tortillas with an over-abundance of shredded cabbage and a little bit of pico de gallo. The chicken and fish were both battered and fried to a crispy perfection. A side of hot sauce accompanied the tacos.   On seeing my friend's cup of tortilla soup ($4), I ordered one to go with my Mexican-themed meal. The tomato-based soup was delicious, with a blend of spices giving just the right amount of kick. Though, they seemed to have skimped a bit on the amount of shredded chicken in the soup.   While inhaling my delicious food, the waitress asked me if I would like another glass of wine. I shook my head and said \"No, I'm okay.\", but she must have heard just the \"Okay\", because I soon found myself with a second glass in front of me. To be fair, the restaurant was pretty loud, and I figured since it was already there, I might as well drink it.  My bill came to about $38 (+ tip), including my 3-way shared appy, 3 tacos, a cup of tortilla soup, and two glasses of wine. With a positive vibe and a fantastic location, I'd say LOCAL is a great place for an after work hangout. As far as the food goes, the LOCAL chefs are quite talented, but it seems that they cut some corners in order to increase profits (e.g. lots of shredded cabbage to fill up the tacos, very little chicken in the tortilla soup).   FOOD: 4/5 SERVICE: 4/5 LOCATION: 5/5 VALUE: 3/5"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have had good experiences (not great, but good). It's a fun place to be, no doubt about that. The latest experience, however, left much to be desired. We've had four different servers and have had far too much time without any service. Very unfortunate. Still have no clue who our server actually is."}
{"text":"So I'll review this as I come here often.  They don't get 5 stars for food but a mixture of great service and even better atmosphere is why I go back and give this review a high 5. Yes it's literally what Liberty Village is crammed into a restaurant but its liberty, take it or leave it.   First the booze is cheap, like when you look at the bill at the end of the night and you secretly think they forgot to put 4 beers on your tab..cheap.  Also a great selection of drinks (well as long as place has wine, vodka and a beer I consider that a good selection).  They rotate their beer as much as Donald Trump talks about Mexican immigrants...yea, that much.  The food is good and not pricey (You fancy huh...naw, I just want a tasty burger...thanks) and that's what they provide, among other.     Great staff overall and always friendly almost being friend like (without the need to buy them present every god dang year) (side note, its annoying buy friends presents, I prefer a good solid high-five).  Ok back to the review.  Their breaky is good on weekends and most of the time I'm hung over so most things are good (sleep, Tylenol) at this time of the day anyways so win-win.  Their fried egg sandwich is STFD good (Shut the front door). I assume they put crack in their potatoes because I eat like a third of PEI's potatoes every time I have breaky there (sorry Miss Gables).  You're prob not going to give this place a 5 star but if you go often like I do, it grows on you and does not slap up your wallet like other liberty spots."}
{"text":"Best outside patio! Best margaritas with fresh lime no less! All drinks come in cowboy boots?! $6 Caesar and Bud light on Sundays?! Best tortilla soup ever!? Chicken burger to die for?! Miso gravy poutine?! What not to love!!!!! Great scene, good looking peeps, awesome in door and outdoor seatings. Friendly waitresses. And they have shuffle board!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to grab a bite to eat or round of drinks in Liberty Village. The food is always delicious (I usually get the tuna club) and the prices are reasonable (slightly high end). I like the casual atmosphere, and the crowd is generally pretty friendly. The service is also excellent. I usually dine/drink here a couple of times a month. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"There is a white, tall, long hair brunette lady probably mid 30s , she wasnt helpful at all with the menu, in fact very lazy! People like this shouldnt work with customer service! What a shame!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday after work to eat & drink away work stress, (you know you do it too) Local has a great atmosphere very chill and relaxing, makes you forget about all your troubles and just have a good time with friends. I really enjoyed sitting in the upstairs patio.   Food: I recommend getting the chicken and/or fish tacos (I got both XD) Calamari was a great shareable app. Tuna poke was delicious, raw tuna, avocados, enjoyed with crispy chips yum!  Drinks: I really wanted to try all the drinks INABOOT but I was feeling for some shots that night and drank shots of whisky instead lol! Other people were drinking cocktails etc. It all looked very appealing. A definite must try for next time.  Our server was awesome. She was surprisingly very attentive since she seemed to have so many tables to deal with, She was super cute and friendly. (I think my colleague has a crush on her now) Hope we get her again next time! Forgot her name though =(   Atmosphere - 5/5 Food - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Value - 5/5 It didn't hurt my wallet as I thought it would =)  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Local, it's close to where I work and a definite goto place after work. I will be back to try more items on the menu and maybe on my day off come for Sunday brunch which I heard ppl rave about!"}
{"text":"Very rustic, and interesting venue. They have wine on tap, which is pretty cool. The draft menu there gets switched (I think) once a month. The menu is small, but there's still plenty to choose from. Food was good. Will likely return :)"}
{"text":"I was expecting to find another over-priced and pretentious Liberty Village bar but was pleasantly surprised, as were my two buddies, when we went here on a Sunday night.  The decor is nice and casual and the open concept where everyone can see everyone else and move rather swiftly was intelligent design. We also liked the airport sign drink list, nice touch, though if I sat beside that sign the switching of the letters would surely annoy me.  Instead we ordered some beers and nachos and played some shuffleboard game that's beside the kitchen. The beer kegs are covered in wood barrels which gives it a nice saloon vibe to the place. Beer prices are very reasonable given the over priced joints in the neighbourhood (aka Brazen Head).  Food was decent, again had nachos and fries/chips with a nice guac dip that was mixed in front of us. We'll be back next time TFC season starts in the spring."}
{"text":"The experts were right. You shouldn't grocery shop hungry or go to a restaurant hungry; cuz then you buy a lot more than you need. That happened to me! I was so hungry I ordered a Caesars salad, 2 fish tacos and churros for lunch. It was A LOT of food but I didn't let a minor detail like that stop me from eating it all. It was my first time eating fish tacos but it won't be the last. The food was delish and the taco veggies tasted fresh.  The churros were the only thing on the dessert menu and they were served with a thick cocoa dip that had roasted marshmallows floating on top. Le sigh du bliss!!  In terms of ambience, the inside was a little dark but I opted to sit on the community table in the patio. It's a good spot to people watch as long as you have the self restraint not to butt in on the conversations of the strangers sharing your table.   I went towards the end of lunch hour and service was quick. No complaints on the chirpy server. Just wished that if she cared enough to ask me a question, she'd stay long enough to get an answer.  My lunch came out to just over $20 which is a pretty decent deal for a good restaurant lunch in Calgary downtown."}
{"text":"They have a really nice patio. I've been here twice and did not have to wait for a table. The quesadillas were our favourite. The cocktails come in cute boot shaped glasses. We were refused alcohol without our ID's the first visit. The second time I went, I made sure to bring my ID, but they didn't even ask. :S"}
{"text":"Great location, food and staff. Affordability and casual clientele make for a good experience - The bocci ball court and shuffle board games aide in this aspect.. Quickly becoming a favorite go to hot spot, would highly recommend for a casual night out."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch in between work. Great atmosphere.  Didn't feel anything like Origin that preceded it. Great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. They rotate their taps every Thursday, as with many places downtown. So there's always something new to try!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Local Burger with sweet potato Fries. The garlic Aioli is amazing!   Food is great and consistent here. Wait staff very friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ok this place was the total package. Buffed out dudes on the bar, good looking gals serving, cheap/ delicious eats, and to top it off an insane beer selection from all over.  Honestly if you can't find what you are looking for at this place, than don't go out to restaurants and eat at your own home.   This place had the most amazing atmosphere to go along with friendly staff (and it was insanely busy the night I was there)who were courteous and helpful(I was visiting from out of town)."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for work. Great lunch spot. Great fish tacos.  Busy place. Service could be better."}
{"text":"Finally had one of their burgers a couple of nights ago and it may have been one of the best burgers I've ever had. I love this place, the music is great, the beer is great, played a little shuffleboard...great! I might have to move to liberty village."}
{"text":"Took ten mins. Complained. Was asked to leave. Terrible customer service. Happened at 6:04 Pm on a Sunday Nov 9th."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night and it was very busy but got great service! The atmosphere is awesome, and the food is delicious! We also got churros for dessert and they were sooo sooo good! And great price! Very impressed :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Fish Tacos are outstanding - better than Grand Electric's imho. Also VERY kid friendly.  My four year old who is picky and can be fussy was having a rough day and I had bought him some other food somewhere else, as it was the only thing he'd eat.  The server said \"No Problem.\" What a relief.  I went back after that experience - having been treated with such consideration.  Same type of treatment ... every time I've been.  Great work everyone!  Please keep it up!  Thanks, Nicole"}
{"text":"Food is actually pretty good! The tuna sandwich, tuna salad and burgers were fantastic. Been here twice and would come back again. Love their rotating beer menu!  Crowd is generally 20-35ish, reflecting the surrounding liberty village area. It's a busy place."}
{"text":"Local public eatery... You are fun!  Happened upon this restaurant when headed to the CNE and so it was the natural choice when leaving the CNE.  Loved the bocce ball game in the patio, but didn't get to play.  The patio was lovely but seating was limited.  Also the Jays game was on inside the bar, so we sat there.  The vibe of this place is really fun and I love the menu.  We just had $4 Sapporo beers (Tuesday deal), tortilla chips and churros.  Odd combination.... I know.  The chips and salsa are endless and only $5 so are a good sharing food.  The salsa was a bit strange, but however.  The Churros, also $5, are another great sharing plate, and they were amazing!   There is a huge board on the wall that changes regularly to see what beer is \"on deck\" and what beer is \"now pouring\".  The waitstaff were kind enough to explain how it works, and it was fun to see it changing while we were there.  I am looking forward to coming back here, for great drinks and good food."}
{"text":"Enjoy the food very much here Love how the venue Looks The outside patio is to die for they have the game to play in the middle and there's always special you can enjoy a good drink. Good staff love coming back here when I can"}
{"text":"So impressed by this place. We came here on a busy Sunday for brunch and ordered ceasers. They took a while to get to the table but not a totally unreasonable amount of time since it was really busy in the restaurant. The manager came over and brought our drinks and apologized and gave them to us on the house! Then our server came by and apologized. I was so impressed by the service it was outstanding to see. Food was super yummy too and nice small touches were added to the meals (e.g. Smoothie shot with breakfast sandwich). Will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant. Best Poutine ever. Greating from Czech republic"}
{"text":"Living in the area, its great to have another restaurant! It is such a rapidly expanding area, so the extra choice is definitely a treat.  Value wise the food is pretty amazing. My boyfriend and I shared the fish tacos (which were incredible, especially since Brazen Head got rid of their original fish taco and replaced them with their current ones) with the Street Corn, which was also pretty amazing. We ordered some dumplings after, because we were still pretty hungry (the other two things with meant to be more of an appetizer)... Those took about 25-30 minutes, which is when our experience took kind of a turn. We were sitting at the bar, and there were two bartenders on... we felt kind of ignored? We both have worked in the industry for over 5 years each and LOVE to sit at the bar. We didn't want to take up a 4 top from a server when there was only 2 of us, and we love the interaction that a bartender can provide. Unfortunately, once our dumplings were very obviously forgot to be rang it (we didn't make a big deal, because we were enjoying each other's company and our beverages), she set us up for our dumplings. It then took an additional 10 minutes of both of our drinks being completely empty, when the service bartender (the one making the most chits) I think realized we wanted some service. Which we then finally got to order drinks and dessert.   Overall, we aren't hard people to please as we love food, wine, and beer. We also aren't hard to please on the service department because we can easily relate to any issue a server is going through... but when we see a bartender paying more attention to another group (who I'm pretty sure were staff because EVERY staff member would go talk and say hi, and hug each other goodbye), it makes it hard to want to become a regular when we are looking for a regular spot.   Great food though for great value, okayyy value for beers (even though they are 14 ounces compared to a standard 20oz pint... do the math, not CRAZY savings compared to other pints in the area), awesome local wine selection, and mediocre service.   Three stars."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off with the service which was mediocre, the waitress didn't introduce herself and only seemed interested in having any interaction with us when it came time to pay.. obviously in search of a good tip, can't blame her. The food was okay, I had the calamari.. nothing too crazy good about it. The fish taco was really great, loved it paired with the valentina hot sauce! The churros are a huge disappointment, very dry and not hot at all. Kung-fu punch was the highlight of my visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious and not too heavy, had the veggie burger. Loved the beer options as well. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"i have been there a lot unfortunately not going for a while change your menu guys!!... since the start nothing has changed it's getting stale also this bar is supposed to represent the neighbourhood so what is with the \"club\" music thursdays!?!? i was there recently. ave age would have been at least fifty and you are playing quite loudly club like music.... asked to turn it down... nothing     thanks for the reply!  I appreciate the response and will drop by with the guys ..."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos money can buy. I go here for beer, although Kraft down the street has much better deals."}
{"text":"While I liked the decor, the fact that LOCAL serves its beer at room temperature means I won't be going back. Too bad, because that should be an easy thing to fix. Maybe their goal is to attract a lot of Brits who like to drink warm beer."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had in my life! Hopefully management reads the reviews here as the bad service seems to be a common thread. Food is good but the service is atrocious! Time to hire staff that have a clue..."}
{"text":"Great food. Fun atmosphere. Bocce ball on the patio? Don't mind if I do! Their burgers are worth waiting in line for - which you most likely will do. It's constantly busy, particularly from happy hour onward. Worth a visit though!"}
{"text":"Food and beer were really good and the service was attentive and thoughtful, but don't go here expecting to be able to have conversation. I left with a sore throat from shouting over the music. Just a few decibels lower would have made a huge difference. Probably wouldn't go back at night. Better for workday lunch, I'd bet."}
{"text":"I just loved this place. The staff are great and the best part for us was they had a place to tie our dog up. The food was reasonably priced and we enjoyed everything we ordered. We really had zero complaints and will definitely be coming back. I would recommend this spot over any other in liberty village that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night after work for dinner and a few drinks.  Only had to wait about 10 mins for a table which is pretty good.  They have lots of different local beers to try which is nice.    I had the veggie burger and fries, it was sooooo good.  They make everything from scratch in an open kitchen that you can see from almost anywhere in  the entire restaurant.  The only thing we thought was kind of annoying was the noise level.  It's very loud so when chatting with friends you pretty much have to scream.  Can't wait to  check out their patio in the summer."}
{"text":"To be honest, the Local's concept is very much off in Leaside.   It's, basically, a bar.  In a bar you want a group of locals to get addicted and become regulars; kinda like Cheers.  The reason I love Leaside is the family friendly atmosphere.  My daughter and I like the area.  If you are the type of person that doesn't have achohol with your meals; this might not be the place for you.  The waitstaff is oblivious to the Local brand.  Trust me: i get it, but they are not, really, invested in the pub. It's like they're waiting for Canada's Next Top Model to call.  When, I just want the food the local is advertising.   The first couple of times I went for take-out; it was good.  But, I don't know what happened the last few times it has been crap.  Maybe, it's just there way of telling don't come back here.  I've seen waitstaff rolled there eyes at me, before  taking my order.  I can , somewhat, ignore the waitstaff's attitude: if the food is excellent.    I spoke with  headquarters in British Columbia and they assured me that Local Public Eatery does not stand by the quality of the food I was served, and that the level of customer service, and food will improve.  Headquarters was very kind, and understanding.  I don't drink ,so all my family can go on is the food and service.  Leaside does need quality restaurants.  Luck."}
{"text":"We went here with a few friends before a Marlies game one day. When we arrived there was no server or hostess we basically sat ourselves. After about 10 minutes someone came to take our drink orders and we decided to order an app since we were starving. We got the perogies and our friend ordered the nachos. We got some drinks and then we waited....and waited and waited....what I'm trying to say here is the service was horrible. Our perogies and drinks finally came, our friends nachos were nowhere to be found. The perogies were actually really delicious, creamy inside and nice crunchy fried onions and smoky bacon on top. Our other friends joined us...still no nachos. They ordered drinks and decided on food (a burger I think)...still...no nachos. We inquired again, hey we ordered nachos about 30 min ago... A waitress said she would look into it. Finally food arrived for our starving friends! The nachos although delicious (I tried), weren't likely worth the half hour wait. In the end we did get some pretty good food but the service blew. It was so slow we eventually just started ordering drinks in multiples. If you not actually hungry and have loads of time to spare this could be a good place to hit up.  Side note: 3rd star was for the excellent horseradish cesear served in a cowboy boot!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and to catch up with an old friend! Place was great, and very friendly service. I had a chicken taco, fish taco and gyoza which were all very delicious. Menu prices were reasonable but a couple items were overpriced ($8 for 5 pieces of gyoza and $8 for yam fries) All in all a great place and I can't wait for summer cause their patio looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day last week. It was super packed but the service was great!   Had the Local burger and it was just OK. The bun was definitely over toasted so was really hard to eat. It was super drippy too which made it difficult to eat (not a first date burger!)   The fries tasted like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp for a while, which doesn't make sense considering how busy they were...maybe they always taste like that?  Great draft beer list - I really love their rotating taps, consisting of mostly local craft beer!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my mom last week. Immediately I can tell you, if your driving be weary of getting a parking spot. We barely made it in and it was the middle of the afternoon. Also the parking lot was like a sheet of ice (no salt what so ever) and I almost slipped and fell on the way in. Anyhow! The space inside is actually quite large, the place was busy but we managed to find a seat fairly effortlessly (we did almost steal someone else's booth due to their \"seat yourself\" rule). Our waitress came quick for our drink orders (I got the chuck Norris punch and my mom a glass of the \"secret wine\"). The punch was ok, wasn't overwhelmingly sugary which was good. We decided to spilt the perogies, the yam fries and the local burger. All of which were excellent, my only comment would be a little bit too much salt on the fries but that's being picky. The service was good - attentive but not annoying. We def. had a great experience and will be back (we even got to see a former leafs player sitting across the dining room - pretty cool!)."}
{"text":"Was at this location just over the past week while on buisness in Toronto. As this is located right in the heart of liberty village make it very convienant place to grab a beer, burger in a great atmosphere.  Tons of beers on tap and a cool peg board of shorts that flicks and changes like an old style slot machine to show the current beer specials what's on tap and what's ran out.  They also have a shuffle board which is a big hoot if you want to not just sit and down your froth!  The menu is not huge but it's just right to get what you need and continue your great time with friends or even a pit stop on your way home after work.  Pros - location and staff Cons - very popular spot in early evenings so if your looking for low key this would not be a good choice."}
{"text":"It's a brew haha of a good time! Miss Shannon our hot waitress took good care of us. This place is hopping and I can see why. A local atmosphere, hence the name. They have decent eats, an above average looking crowd and the ambience of being downtown. There is no parking, although. Which is to be expected in the core. The major reason I'm yelping today is because I'm so impressed with our waitress. She took great care of us beginning to end. Even after we paid our bill she hailed a taxi for us...now that deserves a yelp and a half! Now that I feel like a local at Local...we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice  First time around I ordered the burger with blue cheese and found it pretty good . The fries that accompanied it were ice cold and they were remade right away. When piping hot  they were very good. As the price of  \" gourmet\" burgers in Toronto quietly creep into the $ 16.00 -$ 22.00 range I find this burger to be pretty expensive for the $ 16.50 price.   Next time up was a recent Friday night around 9.30 pm and I went with a group of 5. The place wasn't busy and after we seated ourselves it took at least 10 minutes to have one of the nearby idle waitresses come by to acknowledge our presence. Had we had been a group of 5 young 25 yr old studs, rest assured service would have been very quick.  That being said, I ordered the  wings based on a friend's recommendation.  At $11.50 , you're given a pound of hot Buffalo style wings. You want 4 small celery six,  that's another buck!  . Food and drinks arrived shortly after ordering. Very quick. Not surprised given the place was slow and our waitress zoned in on the fact that this might be  her last table for the night. So the food arrived and my chicken wings were placed before me. Or should I say Sparrow wings !! These things were almost microscopic. I mentioned to my waitress these were the smallest wings I've ever laid eyes on. No exaggeration  .At that size a pound should've yielded 18-20 wings. I received 11 pcs.  ugh ? Our waitress confidently told me this was new the new normal with chicken wings that are free of hormones and antibiotics and that's why they're so small.  Well if that's the case have your kitchen manager check the scale you're  supposed to use for accuracy and offer up a true pound of product.  Not sure I'd go back. I'm under the impression the restaurant group out of Vancouver  that run Local(s) ( Joeys as well ) are very much profit driven and don't care all that much about providing the ultimate dining/drinking experience. It shows in  the calibre of inexperienced FOH staff they hire and the lasting first impression  they leave.  The same is probably true with  kitchen staff.  I'm mean which experienced line cook would  let ice cold fries leave the kitchen thinking it would be ok? Doesn't say a lot a restaurant.    Lastly, reading these reviews here I cannot understand why so many restaurant critics here are apoplectic about not being served or offered  water . It's not a given anymore. And most likely these negative water  comments are coming from people who've  never served  or waited tables before. Is it that you're cheap pricks who don't want to buy a soda or a real drink ? Or go you think a drought  is immenent?   Heaven help us when you'll be charged for a breadbasket in the near future."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Monday evening and it was quite busy. The Patio is really nice, great beer selection, and very reasonable prices for Toronto. I tried the Veggie burger which was pretty good. The fries were yum as well. This is definitely one of my \"LOCAL\" favorites in Liberty Village.  On a past visit on a busy Saturday night last year, we were told that we could not stand around the bar and had to be seated. This was a bit wierd to me. Why have a bar if you are not allowed to stand?"}
{"text":"So glad I ate here. In and out in 45 minutes during prime dinner time on a Thursday night. The place was packed but we got seated and served so fast! $4 rolling rock special on Thursday. We both had the Brooklyn burger which was pretty darn fantastic. One with yam fries, the other with onion rings. The yam fries came with an amazing truffle lemon aioli. It was great sitting at the bar and the bartender was very attentive. Really cool crowd. Individual bathrooms. Walking distance from exhibition go station. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"What can I say.  Decided to stop @ the Local for a bite to eat with my wife and friends.  Place was packed and the weather was amazing.  Out door patio was open and fining a seat was a chore. The service was great, out waitress was running around and was doing her best.  There were a couple issues with our food, but the waitress and Mgr took care of it right away in such a professional manor that it will make me come back for more.  Quality of food was great, clean and vibe was inviting.    Would recommend the Local to everyone that wants great food, great energy, great people.  Make it to the Local to become a Local!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the whole steak sandwich plate really good. Had the Big Kahuna burger in the past and also tasted great. Will come back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Pretty decent food with a varied amount of pub food. Tacos are tasty (5$each) It's got a laid back but clean Vancouver feel to the decor. There's a huge selection of beers and the servers are good at explaining them to you. Prices reasonable:  3 beers, 2 tacos and a burger (13$) was Total cost ~36$ My boyfriend had a piece of the candle in his half-done beer and notified them of it and they gave him a brand new full beer with no worries.   Definitely go back to this place. Although I heard the weekend brunch gets super packed given it is in the middle of Liberty Village"}
{"text":"An early lunch during Stampede week led my gfs and me here, and even though it was pretty busy but the service and food were not lacking at all!   One gf started with the tortilla soup and I got to take a few bites - super tasty! The spices weren't too overwhelming and complemented each other really well.  I decided on the crispy chicken sandwich with fries for my main. Granted the coleslaw and the BBQ mustard sauce made my sandwich pretty messy, it was so good! The chicken was crunchy and juicy, and the shoestring fries reminded me of the old Joey Tomatoes ones (which we later learned that LOCAL is actually part of the Joey Restaurant group!)  Considering this place is literally across the street from my office, I will definitely suggest this place for future after work events or even lunch!"}
{"text":"I don't typically leave, or feel the need to leave reviews when I head out for drinks with some friends, but felt compelled to after my experience last night.   A group of friends and I stopped in to Local after leaving a concert, and apparently everyone else had the same idea as us. The room was packed on a saturday! Not seeing an open table in sight, we ventured to the bar, which was completely surrounded. We started to chat about heading elsewhere, since the team behind the bar were moving fast, but had many other customers to get to.   A bartender with LOCAL written on his shirt noticed us, while making what looked like 20 different cocktails going out to tables, waved us over, and took our groups order while continuing to make other drinks. While making our drinks, another bartender promptly brought over our bill, just in time for all of our drinks to be ready to go. I usually don't get service that fast at any bar, let alone one that is packed shoulder to shoulder.  To sum it up, polite and friendly staff, great atmosphere, clean (for a pub), and one of the better margarita's I've had in a long time. Thanks LOCAL, will be back.!"}
{"text":"Not bad service.  Budweiser special doesn't count for every bud they carry. This includes non alcoholic beer. That was a let down already knowing bud sucks.  My friends ordered meals and they said they were good. The yam fries weren't fried all the way so you could tell they were previously frozen.  Ordered churros for dessert and figured it'd come with more than 7 tiny marshmallows.  They played the spice girls. Which made me wonder WTF crowd they were trying to keep happy considering it was male dominated.  Massive place. Sports on every tv. Typical pub style with the worst music.  Prompt service. Our server was friendly and sassy. I enjoyed that but again...the music was terrible."}
{"text":"Great food and beer, cool atmosphere, and close to home. I had been waiting for this spot to open for a while and it did not disappoint. Some of my favourite beers on tap. I would recommend the fish tacos, tuna club, or jerk chicken sandwich to go with the beer of the day."}
{"text":"Great spot to have drinks and a bite to eat.  Staff is always so accommodating and friendly.  Couple great items is the Cauliflower appetizer, Fish tacos, and a spicy Caesar to finish.    Reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Local in Liberty Village is one of my very favourite spots to grab a beer (or 5) in Toronto. The staff are incredible and the service is absolutely excellent. Try the fish tacos and/or the wings. I've also had brunch there which was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"I brought a double date there and I was asked to stop being romantic (kissing) or we had to leave.  So we paid our bill and left.  Don't go here on a date!"}
{"text":"I live across the street. Been here many times. As a veggie the food options aren't great, although you should give their burger a shot. Great spot for drinks though! In the warmer months their patio is always kickin, and even if u don't get a spot outside, they have great decor and music inside as well. Lots of TVs to catch the game!"}
{"text":"I came here with 5 of my friends. I chose the Tinuana Ceasar Salad. One of the best salads I've had, tangy, flavorful, and different textures on this salad. Awesome ambience and great for families as well."}
{"text":"Great patio, service was friendly and punctual for a busy Sunday, though not lightning fast, and the food was great! Three of us had the huevos rancheros and we all loved it. The fish and chips was good too. Lemonade is recommended for a hot summer day. We didn't try the beer though I've been told they have a good selection."}
{"text":"My burger was great but the chicken sandwich my wife ordered was not cooked properly. Also the fries were amazing which is why this place isn't a complete no go."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Staff were polite and quick.  Lots of different beers which were amazing.  Fish and chicken tacos were delicious.  Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Fortunately, the food here hasn't succumbed to low expectations of Liberty Village. Three times in, and it's been consistently good. I would recommend the chicken tortilla soup (this is one of the only places we can find it) and the jerk chicken sandwich is great too....that bun, though!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to drop by for some drinks and wings! We were not disappointed. We walked in and grabbed seats at the bar to watch the Raptors play. *GO RAPTORS GO* We got there around 8ish and it was pretty busy for a random Wednesday night. The bar seats were great for watching the games, there were a bunch of TVs on each wall, so you didn't have to worry about breaking your neck all night to watch the game.   They had great selections of IPAs, wines, cocktails, and liquor. Their food menu wasn't 3 pages long but had enough variety to make a group of friends happy. We got an order of HOT wings and their Tijuana Caesar Salad. The wings were perfect and hit that craving for some hot wings. As for the salad, some people would be disappointed with the portion, I mean for a $13 salad, you expect something \"more\". HOWEVER, it was maybe... the best chicken salad I have ever had. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and still juicy! The lettuce was fresh and had enough dressing. Each lettuce was touched by the dressing. If the salad was $9, i would be eating it every single day.   Overall, I had a great time. Our waiter was great. He was friendly and took care of us. I mean, he was kind of distracted by the girls at the bar and forgot my water twice. It's okay, I forgive him.   If you're in the area, drop by, grab a beer and enjoy some wings!  Happy Belly :)"}
{"text":"Good food.  Interesting beers on tap. Great atmosphere.  Only downside - very, very noisy."}
{"text":"Erratic quality, friendly service. Myself and a guest went recently and ordered the exact same items: Avocado toast with an egg on top and potatoes on the side and coffee. 1 order came out great, mine not so much: Toast/eggs/potatoes arrived lukewarm  Egg was overlooked No non dairy options were available - soy/almond milk anything - it's 2017 - time to add a carton of Silk in the kitchen refrigerator. The first round of coffee for us was delicious, the second terrible. That said - the plusses; The side potatoes were delicious as was the execution of one of the meals. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I've live in liberty village for over seven years. When the Local opened up, I was excited.   Their west coast approach combined with Toronto's downtown work ethic makes for a great place to hang out.  The beers come in sleeves not pints.(west cost style) It's cheaper and keeps your beer colder longer. You can enjoy your drink before it gets warm.   Food. Take the half nachos for example. Nobody brings home nachos and eats them the next day. That's why you can get a half order of nachos. It's a great amount if you just want some chips loaded with all the fixings.   Prices  Vert competitive for the area. Daily specials are awesome.  Take the Sunday Caesar for example. Great price. It's what people what on a recovery day.   Staff. Friendly, attentive, always trying their best to help everyone. I've never had a problem of having to want a while for a drink. - Even in the busiest of situations like SuperBowl Sunday.   Atmosphere. The crowd is a collection of neighbours and guests who for the most part all respect each other. Once in a while a dingus shows up and he's found out pretty quick that this is not his bar.   I'm a bit fan and supporter of this bar. If you're ever in the area, please check it out. You will not be disappointed. Cheers"}
{"text":"We sat in their outside patio.  Mostly picnic table style seating, not good for those with sore backs.  Kids played a bit of ping pong as they waited for the food to come (which took forever on a friday night).  Good thing they didn't shoot any balls into the food of nearby tables.  Lots of eye candy waitresses in skimpy shorts.  Free parking was a plus.  Nachos were a bit bland, even though it came with a ton of toppings.  Burger and fish/chicken tacos were decent.  I liked my fried chicken sandwich.  Fries were soggy and too salty.  Wife's tuna salad was good too.  Overall an ok meal and worth a try, but don't come super hungry as the kitchen is painfully slow."}
{"text":"I checked out the Local this evening for dinner and to my surprise after opening weekend this place was busy for a Monday night.  They had 'All American' drinks specials - beers for $3.50/pint and wine for $6/glass - awesome deals.  Food wise - overall delicious - they make a killer fish taco and very tasty poutine.  Their tuna club sandwich was cooked to perfection and I love the melted cheese in the sandwich.  The Local is a great addition to the Liberty Village 'hood - it has a non-pretentious vibe which I dig.  I am looking forward to coming back for future meals or just simply to hang out."}
{"text":"I rarely crave a burger but when I do, I want to be sure that it is perfect. I got a Brooklyn burger and I'll be back for it! (and for brunch too, looks promising)  Cons: extremely loud, slow service.  Pros: nice atmosphere/interior, delicious food, funny menu."}
{"text":"We came into Local for a quick bite in the city. We enjoyed our food, and it was reasonably priced. Definitely a bar type scene with lots of tvs etc."}
{"text":"Awesome joint, right on Stephen ave. Huge open area and an awesome shuffle board. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Local was packed on a Thursday  night! It was around 9:30pm and there was a short wait for tables.  In Liberty Village, this place looks like the place to be! There were giant screens for  watching sports and the bar was busy.  My friend and I shared a pressed burger ($13) and the appetizer calamari. The burger with miso mayo was fresh and the bun was super chewy and soft. Yam frites where served with dipping mayo and crispy-delicious.  The Caesar ($9) was served with a pepperette and in a glass boot!  Overall, the food was good and reasonably priced! I'll definitely be back to hang out!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. The food was good (not anything really special, but good) but the service was very slow and the music was so loud that you could barely hear yourself think...much less hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere great environment and good food. They have different drink specials each day and our server was great. I had the poke which was a little too small especially given the amount of chips they give. My friend ordered sweet potatoe fries which were delicious and she loved the grilled fish tacos."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for 20-30 Somethings. Everyone was very comfortable, there was even a couple with their child. There is a Baci Ball set up, great for couple or friends to play. We had a great time and were very impressed with the fresh guac made at our table upon served, excellent ceasars ($6 on sundays!!) plus Bud Light which was only $3.50! Great gem in the heart of Liberty Village!"}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere with a lot of energy. One of the best nachos I've ever tried. Polite and helpful staff. I'll definitely go back there again"}
{"text":"After a long flight from LA, LOCAL was exactly what I was looking for: good food, friendly staff, great service, free wifi and some seriously dope fish tacos. Really, they were excellent.  Also of note, their poutine and their Pimm's Cup. Definitely worth your while if you find yourself in downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Been a few times and always on point. Great atmosphere with awesome indoor/outdoor patio upstairs. Finally Leaside has a nice place to hang with friends and family. Need more places like this in Leaside"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places I got to visit during our trip to Calgary. Super cool vibe, great people and fantastic food! I wanna go back!!! Really good drink specials too."}
{"text":"Was hanging out in Liberty village looking for food: Mildred's was full, school was full, so we decided to try Local.   First impression: fancy sports bar with a cool industrial vibe.   It was Saturday brunch; my friend and I shared the hand pressed burger and the bacon Benedict.  The burger - juicy and filled with crisp veg. The fries were pretty normal  The Benedict - OHHHH Ma gawd. The pemeal bacon was perfect, and the eggs were perfectly poached. Only thing is that the Benedict could've been bigger; was quite small for an entre. And the potatoes side were a little too burnt.   Great atmosphere, nice service and good food!"}
{"text":"Bottom line: Four stars for the food, three for everything else.  We went here Friday around 7 for dinner. Things started off rough from the very beginning. A line to get a table? I can understand if it was just for the patio, but nope the whole restaurant! What's the reasoning for this? It comes off extremely pretentious--look at the line to get in our restaurant. It's 2016, most restaurants have at least a buzzer. Many even text you! It's dumb too because I usually buy a beer while I wait for a table, but you can't do that here. Luckily it was a fairly short wait.  This is an issue in many restaurants, but wow it is noisy inside! To make matters worse we were seated by the beer sign, which started flipping and wouldn't stop. It finally stopped, but flipped again later. Very annoying.  Service was mostly slow, waitress hardly checked on us. Our food did come out quickly though. We had the Local burger, calamari, and wings. Wings were small, but good. The calamari was delicious. The burger was good, but not a fan of the bun--too much bread. Fries were meh. Prices are super reasonable. The waitress also brought our bill without us even asking. Okay, that would have been fine except I wanted a second beer."}
{"text":"Living in LV for several months now we had not yet checked out Local. A couple of friends came by last night after a game and we all wanted to have a few drinks so we figured it was a good time. These friends came along with us to Brazen Head a couple of weeks back so for the area pubs this was a good comparison.  Unfortunately we were all quite disappointed. The drinks (we ordered pitchers of mixed drinks) were extremely watered down, full of ice (more water) and after 3 drinks a piece no one could feel a thing. It was like we had not had any drinks at all... we came back to our place and my husband made us one drink which did far more for us all than the pitchers we had at Local. Sad. We did not experience anything of the sort at Brazen Head - drinks were strong and lovely.   We go out a lot and based on this experience will not be returning to Local. Our server was nice, the churros we ordered were edible but aside from that everyone was really disappointed. Too bad. One star for our server making an effort."}
{"text":"Great place for a FRI night drink and dine. Awesome settings retro style in two floors from the dining room with a nice and accommodating bar at the canter of the first floor to the relaxing couches with game boards on the second floor as well as the nice patio. Good food, good drink, good service..."}
{"text":"Other brunch joints had us on waitlist for two hours and i could not be happier that we found this place! The pancakes were incredible! The wait staff was amazingly friendly and we were able to sit on the heated porch! Great experience!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. They had local  craft beer which is unusual for it's location. I went on a Saturday and it was packed with good people, music and vibes."}
{"text":"Neat place - love the old flip board! Had the local burger and loved it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick drink. Got there around 5:30pm on Friday night. Lots of seating available. They even had their patio open even though it was pretty windy and cold. We sat at the bar. The servers were great working the bar and checked on us periodically. We were shocked to find out that most pints of beer were around $6.00. Great service and prices."}
{"text":"Been hearing alot about this place and was downtown one weekday night with a friend so decided to pop in for a beer.  Very popular place in Liberty Village.  It's probably packed on the weekends.  We sat at the bar and waited for 10 mins for someone to greet us...had a beer from their extensive craft beer menu.  Didn't order anything to eat so this review is limited.  It's very loud so don't go there expecting to have any decent conversations.  Will def go back for food in the future."}
{"text":"Great, spacious venue! Lots of natural light. The veggie eggs benny is SO yum. I'm not a vegetarian but felt like I needed a break from meats on the Sunday morning I came here for brunch. You definitely don't miss the peameal, sausage or ham in this dish because the avocado adds some richness to it. Also, the crispy home fries this dish comes with rock."}
{"text":"Came in with friends around 7pm Saterday. Very welcoming atmosphere, the staff is great everybody are friendly and helpful. The slogan \"you are stranger only once\" is very true. So if you are in the area very recommended place to have beer."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a table of 5. This place was really busy but we lucked out and was able to get a table without waiting. Ordered snacks and drinks. Beer and shots were reasonably priced. Had the poutine and nachos both were pretty good. Servers were friendly and the host was responsible in terms of refusing entry for an intoxicated girl trying to get in. They made paying the bill easy because they broke down how much each person's tab was under the final bill."}
{"text":"Cool laidback place. Huge bar, lots of booths, hightop table. Surrounded by windows.   Great beer selection.  Went with Muskoka Detour, awesome.   Decent bar food had the nachos and guacamole.   Great place to chill after work.    Hey Sean,  Thanks for responding to my review. Good to see business owners actually looking at them. For this I move the review up to 4  stars.  In my books this is a good review. If you want to get to 5 you really need to step up your food game.  Knock it out of the park.   Offer something or do it in a way no one else is. Maybe guacamole made fresh at the table, customizeable to customer wants, broader range of mystery wines. I leave it to you , the expert,  to wow me.   To quote a famous man,\" I'll be back\"."}
{"text":"Yum! These burgers are THE BEST. And the nachos delicious too (maybe even THE BEST as well)..... Really, everything tastes so fresh and full of flavor!!!  Great location, right on Stephen Ave. Lots to do and see. If it's nice out you should hit up the patio (space permitted).  Love the music here. And the pool tables. Also offers intimate booth seating and group accommodations.    I keep coming back. I think you will too (check-it-out)."}
{"text":"biased because live in the area and it's one of the best establishments we have in the area.  came in for a pint and the server forgot to punch it in so it was about 10mins until she realized she had forgotten and took it off the bill for us - we told her she didn't have to do this as we just appreciate yard her acknowledgement of the error but she insisted and said that's not her definition of customer service.   i've been here a few times for brunch as well, and never once have i had a bad experience.   they play all major sports games and with sound too - appreciate watching football on a sunday with sound.  it's nice in the summer because you can sit on the patio and play games, they also have a shuffle board inside!"}
{"text":"We went to LOCAL Public Eatery when we decided we couldn't wait an hour for a table at two other popular restaurants in Liberty Village. LOCAL is essentially a bar with a vibe that caters to 20-30 year olds. We came on a Sunday and it was busy, but wait wasn't as long as an hour or more, so we waited for a table.  The disappointing stay began once we were seated after a 15-20 minute wait.  First, when a staff gave us a bottle of water and water glasses, I noticed that one of the glasses was dirty- lip marks and crumbs stuck on the glass! So disgusting. Because the restaurant was busy, staff was occupied and all over the place; I couldn't find the original person that gave us the glasses, so I had to flag down anyone walking by to give me a new glass. I didn't get an apology, is dirty glassware a norm here?  Second, the food... we got eggs benedict and steak and eggs.   Before I start, the food wasn't bad and I would have enjoyed it more if it didn't arrive borderline cold. Was it just sitting around, waiting for someone to bring it to the table?? Like the dirty glass, I understand that this is also easily fixed, but the wait for the food to arrive was long, I can imagine another wait for the damn food to be reheated and brought back.  Lastly, paying the bill. There was a wait to get the bill after requesting for it and there was a wait to pay it. In fact, after we were given the bill, our server said she would be back in a few minutes with the POS terminal. A few minutes turned into having to flag her down and she admitted she forgot. Again, I get that it's busy, but OY VEY.  LOCAL commented on my Instagram post when I commented about lukewarm food and dirty glassware and they requested I send them a Direct Message with my contact information to discuss the less than stellar experience. DM sent and I have yet to get a response (edit: they have sent a reply, thanks!)  So, because you asked since you \"take every piece of feedback seriously\"... here you go, LOCAL. You can consider this my summary of this \"less than stellar\" experience."}
{"text":"Don't trust them for a business lunch.  Got a reservation for a Friday on the patio, I was told that 11am would be the latest time I would be able to get a reservation but the patio was confirmed 3 times over the phone. Coming here with 8 employees, we got in around 1050 just ensure we got our spot on the patio, unfortunately there was only 4 seats available outside. When we went in to be seated at our reserved patio table we were told \"ohh there is no tables....\", confused the hostess walked away and started asking the others about our table. No table was provided and while the hostess went to retrieve the manager, the remaining patio seats were filled and there was absolutely nowhere for us to sit. The manager arrived to tell us that they do not take reservations for the patio but they could sit us in the very back of the bar.... We did not want to sit at the back of the bar, we had reserved the patio because it was a nice day. The manager tried to convince us to sit in the back, we did not get any help from the manager and in fact this whole waiting ordeal cost us the remaining patio seats. This place is fine if you want to go get a drink or two but it is definitely not a place I would feel confident about when trying to have a business lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I had the ahi tuna sandwich and everything was fresh and tasted great. I did find that the tuna was more seared than other places/ more than I would've liked, though it was still good. My co workers highly recommend the crispy chicken sandwich as well. Nice environment and a really nice patio, perfect for summer time. Prompt service, good food. I'm not really sure what else there is to say."}
{"text":"I had a Blasty blast of a meal here (FINALLY) on Saturday night. I arrived with a buddy for a late, LATE dinner (10pm +). AND after being turned away not once, not twice but THREE times in the past, just to have a drink here, the sight of a small crowd at the door got me ready to tie my shoes and march on like the wounded soldier that I was...  But then the hostess assured us that it wouldn't be a long wait and we would be seated when the next table rose. Hooray!  So what had me chasing after this place like Preston chased after Amanda in Can't Hardly Wait? (pause for gratuitous 90's movie reference). Well I'll tell ya - it's just so darn cool looking!  A huge wrap around bar, filled with rotating draught beers, kegs filled with pre-mixed cocktail magic, AND there's even a European train station style sign that flips numbers and letters around letting you know what's pouring. All that neatly poured into a sheik, industrial style public house, and voila - cool!  Given the late hour we wanted to sample a bunch of share-ables and appetizers, so here is what we got:  Guac and Chips - typical guac except the X-factor here is that they bring all the ingredients to your table and mash/mix the guac up table side. Nice touch.  Chicken Tacos - Pretty good, nice flour tortilla, good fillings. Not the best but not the worst  Fish tacos - these were off the charts. Perfectly cooked, good portion of white fish in each, tasty toppings and sauced with excellence  Chicken Wings - Should be called mini chicken wings they were tasty but so small, literally a 1 bite situation  DIY Pork wraps - Asian fusion style, 3 pieces of pork that you put together yourself with wraps and toppings. Not a good portion for sharing but good for an appetizer. Felt the pork offering was a tad sparse at that.  The flavour for all the food was on point, and prices across the board were good. I mean all that food and with a drink it was about $30/person, you really can't go wrong.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night since my dad and I was going to watch the Toronto FC game down at BMO Field. I yelped what's restaurants are at Liberty Village and this one had great reviews. There were a ton of fans already eating when we arrived and we had to wait in a line outside by the patio. We waited for around 10-15 minutes until we got a table by the entrance.   While waiting, I just read other yelper's reviews and a lot of people recommended the Brooklyn burger with the side of yam fries so we ordered that right away even without looking at the menu at all and it was my first time here. The food came fast.  The burger itself was pretty good and what really stood out was the red pepper relish. It gave it a little bit of a kick and it blended well with the onion ring and the beef patty. Overall, a solid burger. The yam fries were hot and fresh and I really liked the dipping mayo sauce that it came with.  We were in a rush to make it on time to the soccer game so we quickly got the bill and left. When I come back next time, I will take my time by looking at the actual menu and try to enjoy the atmosphere more."}
{"text":"Good food but damn this place could load up more on the fries lol. The fries were so thin they looked like McDonald's fries."}
{"text":"There's no way around it, this is peak liberty. If you are cool with the vibe in liberty, this is your go-to spot for drinks. I tend to avoid the peak times, but the patio is lovely."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a drink with a friend after the One of A Kind show. Decided to have some nachos and found them to be very good. Loved the fresh avocado on the dish instead of guacamole. The nachos were delish with the pulled chicken instead of ground meat. The drizzle of sour cream over the top instead of the side dish. I've never had such a nice plate of nachos. We were also given extra chips to complete the leftover beans.  Well done LOCAL."}
{"text":"The ahi tuna salad (which is the same as the chicken salad but more expensive) was absolutely TERRIBLE. It was oily, bland, the portion was really small (really expensive), oh and did I say it was really oily? Like DRENCHED in oil.  The burger was much much better (and better priced). The churros were good too."}
{"text":"I've just got to say, as a little reminder, that this is the city of Toronto.  I counted 15 televisions in your bar on Sunday.  Being told that you will put a TFC game on the TV, when the football is over, on 1 of your 15 TV's, while the TFC game is being played, against Montreal no less, makes it very clear to me, that I'd rather not go to you place of business in future. This was all according to the two bartenders, that were told by your manager.   You guys realize, that BMO field, is right in your backyard, right?  No excuses."}
{"text":"This pub is in our top 2 for lunches downtown, mainly because we can get huevos rancheros all day long!  Great service, and quick turn-a-rounds on the orders."}
{"text":"We almost missed this wonderful new spot as we were passing by to have breakfast somewhere else. So glad we stopped in. Ambiance is very pleasant - classic tunes in the background, a comfortable spacious moon-shaped booth and attractive friendly servers. We both ordered eggs Benedict which comes with garlic potatoes and service was prompt. The food was excellent - flavourful, not greasy and a sensible not too large portion for $12. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Somewhat spotty service, but the fun atmosphere and tasty food mostly make up for that. I feel like this place is trying too hard to be cool and \"the bar\" for every kind of youngish professional--it's not the worst, but I feel like they definitely need to stick to one thing and excel at it. Let's just call this a sports bar for the hip 35-and-under crowd.   The beer selection wasn't my favorite, and I was surprised that our server didn't know what a snakebite was. It was not good. But that's forgivable, I guess. I really enjoyed my burger and fries (maybe too much, since my stomach was killing me). Price was reasonable for what you got, especially since I licked my fingers a few times. Nothing like a perfectly seasoned fry dipped in entirely too much ranch. The other half of my burger held up really well in the fridge and tasted great two days later. So that's cool as well.   Would definitely return, especially for a more relaxed evening of drinks and fried food. And i love that they will change the TV to the game you want to watch as well. The game I like to watch is RuPaul's Drag Race; do you think they'll accommodate? ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos, probably best I've had in calgary. Also love the mystery wine glass for $4. Service is pretty good. But Brunch was disappointing. Their banana pancakes are NOT banana pancakes. You can't just put a couple of slices of cold banana on top and call them banana pancakes. And they were not served hot or with butter - that will cost extra. Benedict had heavily overcooked eggs and hollandaise sauce that wasn't as good as homemade. Smashed hash browns and bacon was good though. Also tried huevos rancheros and it was a little spicy (was hoping the sour cream would be on the side) but otherwise it was delicious."}
{"text":"had the Brooklyn burger and ceasar salad. Also the perogies and the chicken quesidallas. So good!! Really like the vibe of the place and great food and drinks! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Celebrating my cousins 35th birthday. There were a constant stream of people coming and going. Liz our server is AWESOMELY FREAKINGLY AMAZING!!  She was prompt, friendly and was on our every need. Her and the other servers were amazing with suck a full crowd. Food was excellent. I heard fish tacos on the menu and ordered those without hesitation. Found out later it's one of their specialities. The hot sauce served on the side was like nothing I ever tasted.  Beer selection is endless."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've ever experience. Not only did the hostess tell us we were going to be seated than give our table to someone else but the waiters were completely incompetent in regards to service and behavior. I don't expect them to be smiling from ear to ear but at least look approachable and friendly. This place needs to step it up or they'll be out of leaside faster than you can say \"soccer mom\". Also all the cups smell like bleach."}
{"text":"Anna N. (Russian) really makes this place.  Server/bartender/goddess/I don't even know, but you would think she owns the place with her bedside manner.  Incredible.  A gem. A rarity to have so much attention paid to you at a pub.  This girl is going places and I would follow her wherever she went."}
{"text":"We visit Local for brunches and dinners. Have always had great experiences. Very family/kid friendly. They have funky child seats that hook up to the tables.  The food is very good and the ambiance is very open and beautifully designed.  Service is very friendly and quick. Maybe a little too quick (you end up feeling rushed to create space for the next customer)."}
{"text":"Usually a good place to have late lunch, however today was not the case.  As drink service was quick, the follow up was not, no one stopped by for 15 minutes, I think she was on break, no one covering her section and a manager on their phone.  Asked for my bill, which also took another 5 minutes, she was not in a hurry either, so I went to the ATM to get cash, clearly this person had too many tables or ???"}
{"text":"This is a great pub/bar. Lovely set up and service. Not to mention every one who works here is super good looking.this place is great for people watching and having a casual beer w a friend. Great selection of beers on tap and their drink specials are actually great deals. Super cozy interior w intimate booths. Food on special is delicious and solid pricing. Some are smaller portions but overall worth the try."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the Liberty Village bars and pubs but I think I've just become a fan of Local. It's got a young, fresh vibe with a lot of energy buzzing through the place. It's quite a big space with a decent sized patio and very industrial modern look to it. Staff here are super friendly and engaging. They have TVs all over the place so it gets pretty crowd when there's a game on.   I only came by for drinks and dessert this time so I'll do another review of their food.  They've got really good drink specials for each day of the week. Tuesday was $4 Sapporo so we threw back a few too many on a work night. They have this really interesting concept of rotating taps, where they constantly switch out seasonal or special kegs of beer. It gets updated on a board in the back which is so cool! You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.   I was initially set on giving them 4 stars but we managed to catch the end of the Jays game here, where the Jays won with a home run in the bottom of the 10th. The whole place erupted in cheer, and put us all in a really great mood so 5 stars it is!  Can't wait to return to enjoy their food and more of their beer!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing salad and fish and chips here last year and tried to repeat that experience on two occasions but they failed me badly. A good place if you want to indulge in sports and happy hour but the food is overpriced, not worth it, and takes forever to come out."}
{"text":"Located in Liberty village, this place fits right in. We were lucky to grab three seats at the bar because after a few minutes, it was packed on this Sunday morning.  I ordered a small steak with two eggs and potatoes. Simple but DELICIOUS. Don't you just love it when the simplest dishes are done right? The butter on that steak was a burst of flavour, that was like a whole other food item on that plate. Whatever it had in it, was probably the best steak butter I've ever had.  Both the eggs and the steak were cooked to my liking. The egg yolk was a bit running. The steak was medium rare. The potatoes were soft but not dry. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 2pm on a Sunday and although they seemed packed, they sat us right away. The layout is two floors, set up with big booths, high and long tables and TV's and the bar in the centre. Service was fast and friendly. Place is full of the typical Queen/King west Toronto crowd chilling with drinks or some food. Everyone seemed to be having a great time, whether chatting with friends or watching the game.  We split the huevos rancheros and the veggie eggs benny, both $12. Huevos rancheros definitely beat out the benny with the flavour and sauce. The veggie benny is a bit bland, although it's laid out in the menu as so so I knew what I was getting my self into. A little salsa or something though, wouldn't hurt but the smoothie shot was a nice touch.  Overall I'd definitely recommend and return.  One criticism though- a glass of OJ for $4.50? A bit much, considering it isn't the real stuff but something out of a carton. Consider repricing."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch this morning!  I don't quite understand why they can't serve booze until 11, but our 10 am brunch was still awesome.  Smoking hot servers and delicious food for a fair price.  Absolutely worth checking out."}
{"text":"What a great find North of the Border! So glad we popped in as we were heading to another restaurant - our order of the Kahuna Burger (pineapple, teriyaki, bacon & onions) and fish tacos were the perfect complement to this chill establishment.  Oh yeah, the fries were awesome.  Would make 15 hour round trip drive from Indiana for lunch (well, probably not, but pretty good)."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and cool atmosphere. In Toronto for a concert and this was a great stop"}
{"text":"Had the eggs Benedict for their Sunday brunch right before 3 however their potatoes were incredibly burnt and had food poisoning from the very sour hollandaise sauce. Definitely needs improvement"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and had great experiences both times. I don't drink, but I love pub food. The burgers here are really delicious. I also enjoyed the fish tacos very much. Delicious aioli and a tasty hot sauce."}
{"text":"Way too loud in there. Not a good spot for a date or catching up with a pal. But if you're going with friends for a drink, the staff is cute and flirty. You must have the churros. Mmmmm... If there's a line up, skip it."}
{"text":"We were walking along 8th ave on a Saturday afternoon when we saw a sign out front advertising beer & tacos for $2.24...we'd be stupid not to check it out right!? Another sign on the inside also mentioned the $2.24 special for beer and tacos so we had a seat at the bar.   The bartenders were extremely friendly and helpful. Not to mention they were constantly cleaning up when they weren't pouring drinks.   I tried a few of the beers they had listed on the wall. We weren't too hungry but decided to give the tacos a try anyway. We were offered a choice of fish or chicken but we both went with chicken. We each ordered just one. Then another one! They were the best chicken tacos either of us has ever had. So delicious and a good size.   The place has a great feel to it. Seems like the kind of place where everyone is friendly to each other...both staff and patrons and just a good place to hang out.   The only negative thing I can say is that when our bill came, we were charged full price for all the beers. Apparently it was only a certain type of beer on special and the signs didn't convey that. In hindsight we should have asked, but since it didn't specify anywhere, we assumed it was any draft beer. Oh well, we will still go back soon."}
{"text":"The place is totally under staffed. Took over 15 min before anyone came to our table. And 30 min to get a second beer. The menu is alright and the food is okay. But if you need to be in and out in an hour this is not the place to come."}
{"text":"Affordable beer!!!! They have an awesome special everyday from 4-6 that has liquor beer wine and food for between $4-$6. I had the steam whistle on draft and it was great. It is made here in Toronto. They have a great porch and it is in a large market building with many other shops and restaurants. They also have bacce! Super cool place and great service for the right price."}
{"text":"I really like going to Local on 8th ave. The staff are super friendly and I always have a great time. I really like the $3.50 pints of Bud on Monday nights - haha. The food is pretty good too! I've tried their burger and a few different types of their wings. The burger is better than the wings."}
{"text":"Our son recommended this restaurant prior to attending a show at Ontario Place at the Ampitheatre. It was an easy walk (under the Exhibition GO train station from Ontario Place). Great vibe, menu and service."}
{"text":"The place is really nice, beer is great, service solid.  Then the food arrived.  We both ordered burgers and they were literally black and crunchy.  I've had well done burgers before, this was not the case, it's like the cook forgot about them, completely burnt.  Overcooking a burger takes a high degree of fucking up even for a novice but actually serving them is what really annoyed us and is unacceptable.  It tells me they have no standards or pride in what they deliver.  I would never serve that to anyone.  Avoid."}
{"text":"I often visit this very bus/lively spot in liberty for drinks and the good food that they serve....but on this day I ordered a pitcher of sangria. My girl doesn't drink much so this usually works for her. Pitcher came full to the top with ice. Sent it back asking for less ice. Pitcher came back half full with still quarter pitcher of ice. Asked why it's not a full pitcher and server explained it's all measured out and price is the same full pitcher or not. Should they not be advertising half pitcher of sangria? Other than than place is ok. Don't order the pitcher of sangria though lol."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5/5 stars overall.   Since this place opened up this year, we have been waiting to try it out. The choices of restaurants in the immediate area are a bit limited so it's great that this restaurant opened.  Every time that I've passed by here it's been really busy. We came here on a Tuesday after 9pm and the place was still pretty busy. It's a little weird that you just have to seat yourself, where ever this available space, but it makes sense when they get really busy.  We tried out the fish taco and the chicken taco. The fish was delicious. It was deep fried, flaky, and not overly battered or oily tasting. One of the most amazing things was my boyfriend who hates onions, ate the ones that were in the taco. The cabbage and salsa that accompanied the taco were fresh and really complemented the taco. The cabbage gave the taco a nice crunchy texture, and added a the brightness of the taco.  We also ordered the calamari, which were nicely cooked, with just the right amount of batter.  The place has several different types of beers to choose from and cocktails if that is your drink of choice.  Service was ok, not the greatest, but okay. Waitress was friendly, but not overly friendly.   Decor is more rustic feeling, red/pinkish brick on the wall. Wooden tables, comfy booths, candles in the brown bottles. A lot of people who live in the area come here. It's a good place to grab a bit, or drink, or just hang out with your friends.  I'd definitely come back here to try out some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant/bar in a prime location on Stephen Ave. It's more on the upscale side but still casual. Lots of space with a nice atmosphere. They have a wide selection of food and drinks and service is quiet good although like many other places, waitresses don't want to make the effort of keeping separate tabs for different people."}
{"text":"One of the most disappointing bars in Calgary. Pretty waitresses but OMG they are thick. The wine is absolutely awful and the clientele just bunch of dumb easy girls and cowboy boys with no taste or brain. This place is only good for psycho evaluations."}
{"text":"On my first visit here I had the ahi tuna sandwich. I thought it was really good, but could've improved somewhat if the grill had been hotter for the searing. A great tuna steak has a bit of the crispiness and caramelization on the crust, but then you want the softness and coolness to reach pretty quickly below that. I felt it mine here wasn't quite seared, but then cooked a bit too much in the middle. That said, it wasn't too off and I liked everything in the sandwich. I tried a bite of my friend's burger and it didn't come off as well as it looked on the menu. The meat on that was a bit overcooked too.  But I came by again the other day and had their huevos rancheros. I was a bit reluctant to order it, but a couple people I was with really insisted that I tried it. Man, I'm glad I did as it was so good! I was amazed at the depth of flavour of the salsa roja and perfect texture too with the right amount of spice. They must have a good supplier for their corn tortillas too as the taste really came through. A generic tortilla wouldn't have shone through the salsa rosa that it came with.  Nice place with a huge beer menu and craft options up the wazoo. Their prices are very reasonable too and lower than I expected. Great ingredients for all I've seen prepared and hopefully it was just an off day for that cook who slightly overcooked things on my first visit."}
{"text":"Great brunch menu on sundays ... Their steak and eggs is really good.  Nice selection of local beers and a great place to catch the game as well.  Often quite a bit of a wait at busy times."}
{"text":"I live in Liberty Village and to have some decent bar restaurants near by has been a such a convenience. This place opened up about an year ago and has been busy. Your lucky if you get seated right away. There always seems to be a line up and a long wait.  The food is decent, better than most of the pubs around here. I've been here a couple of times so I've ventured the menu a bit. I've had the burger, which again was decent but nothing to rave over. The fish and chips are also just decent. The nachos.. you get the point. Everything pretty much decent. They have various types of beer here and they keep it interesting.  The service is tardy and there are times when you're trying to get the wait staff's attention for a long period of time. I would say that getting the bill is a chore which may be the reason for the slow turn-a-round and the long wait to be seated. It's not that they are always busy but it seems that they need more staff.  I would come back again but really isn't at the top of my list."}
{"text":"The place is great! I had the fish tacos which were amazing! My friends has the chicken sandwich which is huge and she said it was amazing as well. The atmosphere is chill and laid back, the place is huge so you should not have a prob getting a table especially when The patio is open (patio has a bocce ball court)  I will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink late on a Thursday evening. Loved the vibe!  Opted for the mystery glass of wine ($4, and you don't know what it will be!) and it was really delicious.   Would come back in again; looking forward to trying some of the delicious looking food."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here tonight. The prices on their menu are quite affordable and the portion size is good. Service is fast, and there's tons of seating room. The place is great for dates or a large group of friends. I highly recommend watching the blue jays game here (but come an hour early) because the crowd is loud and energetic! They also have daily specials for beer, and they serve a ton of options, emphasizing on local brewers. The servers are super sweet and constantly checked up on us. Even though there were a ton of people out tonight, I felt this place was incredibly organized in making sure everyone got what they needed, which is hard to come by for many sports bars I've been to."}
{"text":"Do you ever wish you could go back and lead a different life?  One where you were hipper and lived downtown and ate at a cool neighbor bar like they show on TV?    Local Public Eatery is a place that made me think I may not be cool enough.  The decor could have come from Restoration Hardware (a store), except for the amazing board that displays beer specials.  When I took my second airplane flight as a kid, I remember flying through DFW airport and staring at the flight information board. It was a mechanical wonder that flipped tiles to show status.  LPE has one of those that shows 7+ special beers that they have on tap.  When a keg runs dry, they tap another and change the board.  It almost makes me want to come back sometime with a bunch of friends to see if we can drink a keg dry and watch what comes up next on the board.  Alas, we came here for lunch and did not imbibe of alcohol.  I am not sure what all of the 20-something or 30-year-old-wanna-bes do for a living, but I was amazed at how many people were drinking (alcohol) at lunch!  If I had a pint at lunch to go along with my AWESOME Deluxe Burger, I would have had to take an afternoon nap.  The menu is pretty standard pub fare.  The burger selection is highlighted in the middle of the menu, so we decided to try.  The burger was excellent - great bun, juicy meat, and fresh garden toppings.  My Deluxe burger also had house-smoked cheddar and crispy bacon (the american kind, not the canadian bacon like on a Egg McMuffin).  It came with fries, but for another $1 you can substitute yam fries.  Our server - Michelle - was bubbly and personable.  If all servers could be this nice, I would give higher reviews of every restaurant I Yelp about."}
{"text":"Burgers are just ok. They seem plain compared to the many eccentric choices at many of the new burger joints in town. I think the beef patties are too small and too few, and the bread buns are too big.   The fries are disappointing. Just like the burgers they are plain Jane. So many establishments are doing so many interesting things with fries, it's weird to just see normal boring fries.   The steak sandwich is what's good here! It's incredibly simple in recipe. But it's just so well done.   I might come back for the steak sandwich and switch out the fries for a salad. But gonna check out the other establishments in the Liberty Village first."}
{"text":"Come here often for beers. Living right down the street from this place definitely has its ups. Local has a really good selection of rotating craft beers, it keeps things interesting. Their drinks in general are pretty decent. On Friday nights when the patio is opened it gets really busy and quite fun when in a group of people. When it comes to the menu, unfortunately I'm not a fan. It seems to be a bit on the short side and not the greatest. My Go-tos here are either the pierogis or the wings. This place is more of a social bar with the option of getting some finger foods with friends, than it is a restaurant. That being said I give the bar side of this place 4 stars and the food a 2.5. If you're in the area I recommend stopping by for a few drinks outside, Leaside is beautiful in the summer!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent choice for late-night grub! I had the pulled pork poutine and the fish tacos! Both were off the chain!   The service was excellent and the atmosphere was normal for the kind of place. The prices for the tacos were a bit overpriced in my opinion ($5 per taco), but worth it for the life-changing taste!"}
{"text":"Here in Calgary for Spring break and they gave us free shots of Jameson! Great experience that I don't remember. Five stars!"}
{"text":"I came here last night to grab a bite to eat before heading out and doing some skating and this place was great! From the decor to the food to the ambiance, I loved it all! I got the Brooklyn Burger with the yam fries (instead of regular as I was feeling adventurous) and I'm glad I did because they were some of the best fries I've ever had! I initially feared that the Brooklyn Burger would have been too overwhelming, considering there were onion rings plus a multitude of other condiments inside, but it wasn't at all! My boyfriend got the steak sandwich and wasn't as impressed, therefore, we would not recommend. But he said when he'd been there before and he'd gotten a burger it had been great and that he'd stick to that next time! So maybe skip the steak and head for something else! But all in all I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Such good food! Had the baja fish tacos and I was in love. Probably the best fish tacos I've had in Toronto. Also tried some of my friends chicken sandwich, also delicious. I love how they have a variety of drink specials every night! Great food, service, and atmosphere. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"DEFINITELY have the the chicken quesadilla. You don't even have to share it. It could be a solo appetizer, or your meal. But it's soooooo good, I totally recommend it. My friend and I missed brunch, and it was soooo busy we sat at the bar. But we shared that quesadilla and then I had the fish and chips, while he had the huevos rancheros. Honestly, the fish and chips were good but way too large a portion for me. His huevos was good too!  I think this place is big in the neighbourhood, as the other location probably is in its own, but it's too busy for my liking. I would definitely pop by for drinks and share plates. But unlikely to do so for an actual meal.  Still I liked the decor. It was very well put together place. And the service was decent, although we were at the bar, so who knows what sit-down service is like haha."}
{"text":"Love this place! Just moved to the area, and the staff are warm and friendly. Very cool vibe, with upstairs patio as well as lower level. Drinks are reasonably priced, and there's a shuffle board table inside too. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"With a party of 7 looking for brunch on a Saturday it was great to come to this place and sit right away. I was surprised after finishing my meal that this place was not busier because the food and atmosphere were both fantastic. The steak and eggs were great, little bit of butter added a little bit to the already great flavor of the steak. The potatoes were perfect, small little guys deep fried to get a great crisp. Plenty of bloody Mary's and other drinks needed after a long night of drinking. I would recommend this place to anyone and would come back if in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Finally came here for a team fitness outing. We had drinks and appetizers to start. It was your typical bar food, nothing special. We we wanted more food so we each ordered their Local Burger. It was good but a little on the greasier side making it difficult to eat. The sweet potato fries were good though so substitute it for your regular fries if you like this! One another minus star for coming to this place is that the parking is very limited. It's located right at the corner in a tiny parking lot with only 10 spots? So you don't have a choice but to park across the street at the local shopping plaza. Very inconvenient especially on a cold day!"}
{"text":"If it's your first time here, I would recommend trying out at least one fish and one chicken taco.  They have some nice board games laying around for the patrons."}
{"text":"Very delicious food, a little pricey for the amount of food but that's totally fine because everything is so yummy! Just wish the portions were a little bigger."}
{"text":"Great local watering hole that also happens to serve above average food as well. The menu items are original, tasty and fair priced. Beer selection is solid with local craft selection. Service is friendly and fast. Decor is chic albeit predictable. Been back and will be back. Attention ... Tends to be crowded all the time."}
{"text":"The local in liberty village is a usual of mine, whether a beer after work on a weekday, a fall back for brunch on a Sunday or a place to start on a Friday; it's always a good time, coupled with the ambiance and welcoming nature of the staff which simply add to the appeal.   Over the last two weeks I think it's safe to say we've ordered around half the menu.  From the starters (we) worked our way down starting with the Tuna Poke, the Fully Loaded Nachos, the Fish and Chicken Tacos and the Pulled Pork Poutine, out of the Small shared plates, the Crispy Calamari and the Banh mi style Jerk Chicken Sandwich. My favorites being the chicken and fish tacos, both deep fried and just super tasty. A giant amount of salad/slaw in each, which is a bood or bad thing.   The Tuna Club and Crispy Chicken were my personal highlights; the tuna was seared, toasted and layered perfectly while the chicken was unbelievably crispy while being perfectly moist.   I know what you're thinking, it's a ridiculous amount of food, are you insane? why would you eat so much? etc. etc.   Before you judge it was over 2 sittings and there were four of us so it's not as ridiculous as it sounds. Just a bit of ridiculous...  All said and done, Ive made The Local a regular spot of mine. Without a question, the perfect spot for all occasions with friends or family. The service is attentive and nice while the atmosphere is very welcoming, spacious and is flooded with natural light."}
{"text":"Although it's always packed and there is always line, my friends and I love coming here on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon for brunch. Something about this place makes it perfect for the day after a night out. Maybe it's the somewhat \"industrial\" feel to it or the laid back atmosphere? Either way, the food and service are both great and have never had a bad experience here.  For a starter I'd recommend the calamari - it's cooked perfectly and the sauce it comes with is the best. The eggs benny and the fried egg sandwich are my go-to mains, and they never disappoint. The side of potatoes are done right, but never come with enough ketchup so you'll probably have to ask for more. Also the smoothie shot they come with is an injection of sweet, fruity goodness.  The prices are comparable to any other place in the city and very reasonable for the location.   It's also a great spot to watch sports as they always have the games showing on TV, and the throwback tunes they have playing in the background add to the laid back vibe.   In the summer it's a perfect sport to sit out on the patio and have a drink or a meal!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and last Friday I finally had the opportunity to do so -- and I am SO happy I did!  I didn't have extremely high hopes for the food as I know this is a chain. But I was pleasantly surprised. We split an order of hot wings, chips & guac and perogies between two people. The food was not only more than enough without making you feel gross but it was also fresh, delicious and timely. I should mention that my boyfriend is an extremely picky eater and he loved it as much as I did.  The service was the icing on the cake. We sat at the bar and our bartender was attentive and super friendly with a great sense of humor. He even introduced himself and shook our hands when we sat down (don't know if that's part of their culture or not but either way - nice touch!).  The place was packed but the gentleman at the door was great and even managed to find us a seat at the bar that we didn't see from the door. I loved the ambiance as it wasn't too loud that we couldn't hear each other nor too quiet that I felt uncomfortable (I have a voice that carries, I've been told).  We will definitely be back! In fact, I have family visiting tomorrow and this is where I am taking them. Keep it up guys and thanks for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Great environment. Beautiful deco. Guam is amazing. Calamari gave me a stomach ache of a life time. Beer options pretty decent, good even! Would have liked a salad option that didn't have meat ..."}
{"text":"The avocado toast for breakfast is amazing. Service is meh. Millennialist being cool."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I usually go with my partner and we make sure to order our staple dishes - the sweet potato fries and calamari! No place could do it better for such an affordable price and good sized tapa dishes.   There are a lot of great options if you're a beer fan. There's a lot of selection for the stuff on tap. It's cool seeing the switchboard flip when you're there.   If you like sports, you'll like what they're putting on all of the TVs.    The location is pretty good considering that there's a Green P Parking lot right in front of the restaurant.   The only thing that is lacklustre is the service. Every time we go, either as a table of two or a table of four, it sucks. The line for it is very long, so beware if you're going after 5pm on any given day. The service is very lacking because I see the servers talking among themselves instead of giving their attention to their much needed HUNGRY tables. Yeah, we're god damn hungry because we've been waiting in the cold for the past 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Visiting on vacation and going back for second time. Loved the nachos and great beer selection. Looking forward to trying the fish tacos and a cesar tonight"}
{"text":"Local Public Eatery was a very good spot!  Whether you're looking to drink, eat, or just relax, the atmosphere is great and inviting.  Not a big food selection though but the food they do have is extremely tasty."}
{"text":"\"The interior section was packed and on a waiting list, so we decided to join the brave crowd on the communal benches outside, welcoming the first sun-rays of spring.\"  \"Fish Tacos were highly recommended, but we ended up with the Local Burger - cheese and jack cheese, hot sauce, pickles jalape√±o, onions. It came on a large bun cover with poppy and sesame seeds.\"  \"A bit on a pricier side, a great place to bring your friends over for a genuine pub fare with a twist and good selection of beers on tap. Now we need to go back and get a seat inside to experience the interior - with refurbished city lights, it is one-of-a-kind.\"  Just a few bites of our full review."}
{"text":"Nothing too special. It's like a hipster, more casual mainstream restaurant. It feels franchised to me. The drinks are overpriced for what they are, and the food is as expected. They have safe choices like fish tacos. I prefer places that have more charm."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this gem before attending an event nearby. Loved the decor and the sliding tabletops. The food was amazing. I had the Hippie toast and eggs. My only \"complaint\" would be it came with hot sauce on it which was not mentioned on the menu. For me this wasn't a huge problem but there are people for whom it would be. My colleagues had \"Just the burger\", fish and chips, tortilla soup, pulled pork poutine, and eggs Benedict. All the dishes received rave reviews. The man who ordered the fish and chips wished he had only ordered 1 piece as they were so big (but delicious) and the pulled pork poutine was \"ok\" but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere. The picture is of my Hippie toast and eggs. All in all I would highly recommend this pub, actually I already have to friends who live in Calgary."}
{"text":"Based on all the reviews, I thought I would like this place more than I did. The crowd that night I went was in the 18-25 years range. On a Saturday night, the place was completely packed. Service was fine.   Beer was cheap at $5.50 for a 14 oz glass. The fish tacos were tasty. I enjoyed the fresh crunchy cabbage and creamy sauce inside, but the red hot sauce served on the side was way too salty. The calamari was underwhelming and I would skip this dish. The portion was tiny and it lacked any flavour. The sauce was awful. Hot sauce mixed with something heavy and creamy. I don't like hot sauce in my calamari and the way it was mixed in, there was no option."}
{"text":"This Local is particularly exceptional! I came with a group of 13 or so right at lunch time and as far as I know everyone loved their food. The servers were fantastic and the food came out so fast.  I had the quesadilla and guac & chips. Man, that was the best quesadilla I've had. And I love that they have small dishes so you can get 2 different things if you want.  Other dishes that looked amazing were the salad with ahi tuna, local burger, and of course the fish tacos. The yam fries were pretty damn amazing too.  For a chain restaurant, this place is a cut above the rest."}
{"text":"I love Local!  It is a relatively newer restaurant in Liberty Village.  The food here is fantastic!  The service is pretty great also.  It doesn't seem to matter where you sit - at a table or at the bar - the serving staff are excellent. The decor is really cool and they have a huge patio also. It is almost always busy so come with some patience, it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos of all time!  The band made guac is delish and tasty calamari!  Interesting beer selection for the beer snobs and really cool ambiance!  Awesome patio options (rooftop or street level) with a bar on each floor.   A  hidden gem employing hipsters in midtown!  How refreshing!"}
{"text":"The Local has an amazing patio - it's spacious, has tons of large tables and booths. The interior is also very roomy, and is divided into two sections; a smaller, more intimate upper level (next to the patio) and a more lively lower level where the bar is. There are also a few large TVs on the lower level - good for sports watching.   I had the fish tacos (5 each) and a calamari appetizer. The calamari were pretty tender, and the coating was crispy. I thought it was a bit salty at first bite, but then I kept eating, and eating, and eating...yep. I also really liked the mayo/hot sauce dip the calamari came with - the hot sauce was smoky and flavourful without being stupidly spicy. The fish tacos were fine; there was a good sized piece of white fish that was fried well, but I thought there was too much cabbage in it. The tacos also came with their (house?) hot sauce - yummy!   The Local has daily beer/wine specials - don't remember the wine specials, but every day they have a different beer (16 oz I think) on special for $4. Tuesdays are Sapporo! I will definitely be back, especially to enjoy their patio."}
{"text":"This was my first time here after driving past it countless times. We randomly stopped to finally try it out and weren't disappointed. Has 2 floors with the upstairs being a rooftop patio, a rustic \"local\" vibe, and an open kitchen concept upstairs.  To eat I tried the fish tacos which were surprisingly delicious! I kind of always expect the best but prepare for the worst eating tacos outside a non- Mexican restaurant due to past experiences, but I really enjoyed them. They were 2 decent sized tacos, seasoned to perfection with a side of fries. The mojitos were good (not the best I've had). My date got a burger with a side of fries which he enjoyed, stating that the ingredients tasted fresh.   We got our food fast but service overall was average. I would've rated 3.5 stars.  Would I try this place again? Yeah, probably."}
{"text":"We went shopping close by and just stepped in fpr a bite afterwaeds since it was close. So far best fish tacos I tried in Toronto. The veggie buger was insane. Good service.  Pure awesome if i could give more than 5 stars i would."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time on Saturday  Nice atmosphere  Rustic look which I liked   Menu is simple  Great prices too for the food  We had the guac to start Was mashed in front of us by the waiter  Was really fresh  I had the pressed burger... Had this miso mustard mayo Quite tasty  Wife had the west coast chopped salad Was good as well  The drink menu was unique Lots of craft breweries on there  Definitely would go back again"}
{"text":"Food is amazing the chicken sandwich is the best. Also the rotating Taps. I'd suggest this place for brunch. Great summer hang out."}
{"text":"This is a Local at Stephen Ave. I hang out here for burger, tacos, beer and playing pool. This is a walking distance from my place and usually packed during mid-week, weekends and during play."}
{"text":"I got my chicken quesadilla and i started to laugh.   I thought it was a joke. It was so small and it tasted like taco bell meat.    My partner ordered the fish and chips and it looked great."}
{"text":"Great food - friendly service - quick   The local is right on the outer side of Liberty Village. My friend and I have passed it many times but have never gone in. After a rough night out we went in on a Saturday morning for some \"recovery brunch\". It was empty! Maybe the local is looked at more of a dinner and drinks location because I got western vibes. But that was no issue for us because we were seated right away.  We looked at the menu a head of time so we were ready to order right away. The menu had your standard brunch offerings and the usual price point. We both ordered the classic Eggs Benedict with bacon. My bestie got tea which came with the nicest tea bag and I got coffee.  Our bennies came in about 10 minutes... with little smoothie shots in the middle! Omg they were such a small addition but honestly made the biggest impact. It could be because we were kind of hungover (lulz) but damn, those smoothie shot #blessing. Also, the potatoes were great. Sometimes with bennies the side suffers but at Local the potatoes were well cooked, crispy and had a cilantro drizzle that was so refreshing.  Our server was very attentive, refreshed both of our beverages and was friendly. The food portions were great and we left very satisfied from beginning to end. Will be visiting the Local again!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple times inside the restaurant but sitting in the patio is where it's at. Although the season has changed, it is one the patios to be at in Liberty Village.  I usually go there for a drink with a wide selection of beer but a quick bite is good too. The staff are quick and attentive by offering good selections. The wait at the patio could be long so if you are in a rush, the bar is a nice option.   Food is great at the establishment with my usual pick for burgers and fries. The place could be slightly loud but a late afternoon drink is always fine.  Definitely, one of the preferred hangouts in the neighborhood by residents. The unique part of the bar is the shuffle table and the railway table board listing the recommended beers."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, my friend and I met for lunch, and headed over to Liberty Village to Local Public Eatery; I think that she had been there before or possibly it was recommended by another friend. The pub is quite large, with a large square bar in the middle, and numerous TV's around the outer walls and above the bar. I seem to recall that there was a sign advertising English football matches, but it was Monday afternoon so not much was happening while we were there. The d√©cor is a lot of wood, and it looked somewhat dark further in from where we were, but a nice open atmosphere; there's also a large partially-covered patio outside. The server was pleasant and helpful with choosing drinks, but the food service was a little slow considering it wasn't busy.  I ordered the Press Burger, which came with miso mayo and mustard, and a side of fries served in a small ice bucket. (I am not sure if the ice bucket has some significance, but it seems to be how they serve their sides.) The burger was fine, apparently both burger and bun are made in-house. The shoestring fries were very good, and I think could have been sweet potato instead. My friend really enjoyed her fish taco plate, two tacos with shoestring fries. There are also several other types of burgers, a few salads, nachos, wings, and curried chicken I believe. For drinks, my friend asked a lot of questions about wine before settling on something, and I had a Brickworks cider. They have a good selection of beers, as well as wines and cocktails, and drink specials for each day.  Overall, a pretty good lunch, typical pub fare with that little extra touch, perhaps a little more expensive than some comparable places but not bad; the bill came to about $45 for two. I suspect the atmosphere would be quite different on a busy sports night, but it was a nice leisurely lunch that day."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to come!  I love the atmosphere, great menu and service.  Until reading reviews on Yelp (after eating at Local), I had no idea it was a chain or a part of Joey's.  I thought it was a part of the Local 510, etc. group!    Either way, chain or not - this is a great pub to come for lunch or after work drinks.  It lacks the frou-frou attitude of some of its neighbours along Stephen Ave (ie. Earls, V, the Met).  Very casual and laidback, alternative music playing in the background.  They've really turned this place around from its predecessor, Dakota Lounge.  My friend and I both had the veggie burger - this was not your typical veggie burger either!  Our server let us know that it is made fresh in-house with mushrooms, rice, beans, arugula - it was hard to tell that it wasn't meat!  My only comment would be that I wish they had more gluten-free options, such as gluten-free buns, as there were not a ton of gluten-free options besides salad."}
{"text":"Really love this place. It's got a nice, young vibe and an interesting interior. There is a bocce ball game in the patio, great idea, something fresh and new. Also, the food is good and the selection of beers is great. Prepare to wait in line for the patio."}
{"text":"This is a definite go to in Liberty Village. It has an amazing and entertaining beer menu that looks like the signs in train stations. It's one of the bars that we will regularly end up at when we can't figure out what we want to do because it's consistently good. It definitely gets busy on Fridays and Saturdays. I hear that the brunch is delicious but I've only been there for snacks and drinks. The burger is good and shuffleboard is hilarious. In the summer time the patio is definitely the place to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to Local for brunch a couple of Saturdays ago, after a lot of walking and escalating hunger. The place was clean and spacious. We've stopped in here on another occasion last year for a glass of wine and beer and liked it then too.    It was fairly busy when we arrived and our server was constantly on the move (though not necessarily the most efficient). It took about 15 minutes for our order to be taken and another 15-20 before our food arrived. We appreciate that they bring you a larger bottle of water for the table since we go through it fast.   When our food arrived, mine had sour cream drizzled  - though I requested that it not. There seem to be quite a few things they add to the dishes that are not listed in the food description, so make sure to ask if you have anything you can't/won't eat. The girl helping our server was very apologetic and rushed back to the kitchen to correct the order. Our server also came by to apologize.   In the mean time, I helped myself to the roasted potatoes on my husband's plate and they were hands down the best we've had in a long time. When my Huevos Rancheros returned with extra Valentina sauce, it was perfect! It also came with a few nacho chips since the dish is smothered in salsa. I was stuffed but wanted to keep eating.   All in all, we both agreed that the food was great and a good value. We will likely go back again and would recommend to others as well."}
{"text":"I have been going to The Local since it opened in the 'hood & really enjoy all the food & the service. The space itself is fabulous. Beautiful bar area upstairs- bright & the windows & glass roof can be fully opened on nice summer days. Every server I have had in dozens of visits has been friendly & helpful. Every single food item has been very good. Particularly- fish tacos, press burgers, calamari, perogies + fish&chips (HINT- although not mentioned on the menu, you can downsize to a 1-piece fish& chips). Tons of regularly rotating craft beers (many local) + daily drink specials (double Caesars on Sundays) keep the alcohol menu fresh & exciting. The Local is a great addition to our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Friends and I popped in to grab a few shareable plates before a Toronto Wolfpack game on a Saturday afternoon. Although drawn in by the large patio, we decided to sit inside to cool down. Because it was the weekend, the place was packed and football (soccer) and other sports games were displayed on TVs lining the walls. I really liked the laid-back but aesthetic industrial atmosphere.  We ordered two things to share: half-sized ($9.5) fully loaded nachos (full size is $19) and perogies ($8). The best out of the two was the perogies - loaded with potato and cheese and dressed with bacon, caramelized onion, and green onion slices, these are a must-try (I don't even know if you'll want to share them because they're that tasty). I found the nachos to be really good and different from your traditional nachos - sour cream, jack cheese, sliced olives, french onion slices, jalapenos, a sort of house sauce, avocado, and pulled chicken - I felt like this was a California-inspired plate.  Located in chill and artsy Liberty Village, LOCAL is a great stop for casual but classier pub-type food. It's, in my opinion, it's one of the best places in the area to watch a sports game at or to try before or after you catch a game at one of the nearby sports fields."}
{"text":"We waited an hour and twenty minutes and never received our food. We checked with our server a number of times. The staff was friendly and I don't blame them but waiting over an hour for food is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Food was good. Nachos were great, as is the That Crispy Chicken sandwich. The #1 Tuna Poke needed more tuna.  Service was friendly but negligent. We weren't given water until we asked for water and we were only 2 minutes away from getting a discount for our nachos (we were supposed to get discounts after 9pm). We still had to pay the full price for the nachos, even after bringing it up to the server. If it were up to me, I would have given a manual discount because it was only 2 minutes away from the discount."}
{"text":"I ate here solely due to the buzz surrounding the restaurant all throughout the day on August 3rd. We parked in the parking lot adjacent to the restaurant for OVOFest. It was packed when we left for the concert in the afternoon, and it was still packed when we came back after the concert was over.   It's brand new, and you can tell. It has a unique beer menu, which occupies a large space on the wall and constantly updates itself throughout the day. There are many TVs all around the restaurant, and they played a variety of sports channels, which provided for good variety.  I ordered one baja chicken taco and one baja fish taco, priced at $4.75 each. Expecting tiny portion sizes akin to food trucks' tacos, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my two tacos were big enough to fill a large plate. Not bad for $10! The tacos came with hot sauce.   They were really good, both meats were fried in a similar manner, and the ingredients tasted fresh. I was very satisfied, especially considering the price. Other people in my group ordered the tortilla soup, sliders, and corn, and they all felt the same way.   Definitely a must-try when in Liberty Village."}
{"text":"Love coming to Local for some great pub eats! A local favourite in Hipster Village, they have everything you would expect from a gastro pub PLUS the quality of a higher end bistro.   Big space and comfortable seating they have some next level pub food. Been here several times and only had positive experiences so far. Quality ingredients, great flavours and substantial portions - be prepared for a heavy food coma.  Local is definitely worth the visit if you are around the area with a big apetite. Laid back environment and great patio in the summertime. They have a good range of lighter options like salads, tacos and sandwiches to delicious greasy heart attack burgers.   I loved the tuna club sandwich - think crispy grilled cheese sandwich with thick piece of seared ahi tuna between layers of avocado, fresh tomato, onion and smoked bacon. I haven't tried their burgers yet but my coworkers get them all the time and keep saying how amazing they are - they look unrealz. Definitely my go to pub scene!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with the babe here yesterday.  The space is gorgeous - the decor is very cool, with a speaker wall and beer sign which flips around the latest on tap (you have to see it in person lol). Our server, Stephanie (?), was super sweet and took the time to explain anything we had a question about.  We ordered the chicken quesadilla, crispy chicken burger, chicken tortilla soup, and a side green salad. Everything was super fresh and delish! Loved loved the quesadilla, just so tasty and the fresh jalepenos on top were HOT! Crispy chicken burger was redonkulously tasty - try it!  We even tried a sample of the Mill Street Pumpkin beer, which was quite nice! I would definately return to this place for a drink or some food if I am in this hood!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here!! I ordered the veggie burger and it came with fresh avocado, buttered & toasted buns and great toppings. The patty itself is made with brown rice, beans and almonds which I think is very hearty. It's very similar to the veggie burger served at Joeys. The service was weird, we started on a good note as we Came in with no reservations as a group of 10 and they were able to seat us for lunch. But throughout the lunch we had two different servers that we had to say everything twice to. I also asked for a knife for my sandwich expecting the regular cutlery and the server gave me a steak knife..?!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Usually really busy during game nights and weekends so you might not get a table for a while..."}
{"text":"Good food especially the Fish Taco's. Staff are awesome always friendly. Busy atmosphere any day of the week. Very attentive always fun to go there."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times since it is in he same building as my office. They had some good happy hour deals before the summer with half price tacos. They don't have much else to offer at a value based price.  They have daily drink deals, usually for generic beverages. The service is usually super slow and the servers don't appear to care about the customers.  This time we were waiting for 20 minutes for someone to take our order while the staff were chatting in the kitchen. They seem to be well staffed but still bad service."}
{"text":"Only been a couple of times and both times got some really cool waitresses. The hostesses on the other hand are still figuring out their way around the place. Our drinks and food somehow kept going to every single table but ours lol it's ok, we get the restaurant and staff are young.   Brooklyn burger. Not for me- it has a sweet taste to it similar to maple syrup.  I'm sure some ppl would probably disagree with me. But I wouldn't order it again.   The fish tacos were amazing. Highly recommended!   The gf had the tuna sandwich and she loved it- looked delicious!   I want to say that this place has a better menu than Williams landing. But I'll definitely need to visit a few more times before confirming"}
{"text":"Pros: Decent burgers Good fries cool look to the place good size burger good portions of fries  Cons: very loud slow service bun on burgers were way to thick  This place is more for drinks and watching the game than sitting and having dinner with a friend"}
{"text":"Ayeeeee us AmeriCANS are visiting from the forever lovely country of AMERICA. We were looking for a casual place to stop and get a drink when LOCAL on 8th Ave caught our eye. \"HAPPY HOUR\" and we were in.   Got inside, sat down, super chill, good tunes, and overall great atmosphere.   Here we is.... The cocktails are FANfuckingTASTIC- expensive, but worth it. The food? The food is pure DANK. Service? What service? Anyways if you can compromise your service for some dank drinks and food, well worth it!"}
{"text":"LOCAL is one of the many, many brunch spots in Liberty Village. It doesn't seem to have a tough time standing out, since it was jam-packed when I visited around lunchtime on a Sunday.  The Eggs Benedict is apparently one of the best in Toronto, according to a friend of mine who's a connoisseur. I personally had the steak and eggs. Although it was good, I felt that the portion was slightly lacking.  What REALLY turned me off of this place was the quality of the service. I understand that Sundays are a pretty busy time for places like this. However, we easily waited for over 30 minutes for a table for 5. Furthermore, our waitress never refilled our jug of water throughout our stay.  All in all, the food was good but the service wasn't. I'm hoping my experience was an anomaly since I'll most likely be back to try the Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Fret place for groups and a pre drink / pre game place. House wine is $4.50.. opted for the White wine & it was decent. Food is surprisingly good. We sat by three bar and our bartender was very nice and very attentive! Great go to place in the Liberty Village !"}
{"text":"Went here with a few coworkers while on a work trip to Calgary.  Decent bar food with a nice, relaxed vibe and a good selection of local beers.  The bartender was very friendly and spoke with us about our travels, what we could do in the city, etc.  Overall, I would definitely come back if I am in Calgary again, especially if they have rotating, local taps!"}
{"text":"I love the LOCAL and is a popular spot for me to go every time I'm in Liberty village or TO. I love the atmosphere and the food has never let me down! I recommend getting the sesame chicken salad, it is the best sesame chicken salad I have ever had (and it's pretty much my number 1 choice on a menu). I would be down to drive to TO from Hamilton just for the salad. The drinks are good and there's plenty to choose. There's plenty of tables inside and out so if there's a wait it shouldn't be too long. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I've been here but each visit has been very positive. They've done a really nice job with the decor by paying homage to the building's industrial past all while managing to create a modern feeling ambiance.  The food is generally great - the burgers and chicken sandwich are both excellent choices and are served with a generous portion of fries. I haven't ventured much off the beaten track because their burgers and chicken sandwich I feel are top notch!  My favourite part of LOCAL is the rotating craft beer tap/wall. A large board the size of the entire back wall displays a variety of craft beers and changes periodically. You also can't go wrong with the $4 happy hour beers!  Overall, this is a great spot to have some drinks with friends and catch some TFC or Argos action afterwards!"}
{"text":"Local is the shit. It's got good food, try the guac, fried chicken burger or tuna sandwich. Great drinks at good prices, the flip board is a cool touch, and it even has games like shuffleboard and bocci ball! The only challenge is getting a table, good luck!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax after work with friends! The place was pretty sparse on a Thursday night - at around like 5pm. The second floor is 19+, so our group of 20 was split among 3 tables on the ground floor. We noticed that quite a few of the other tables had very young children stopping by to grab a bite.   The food itself was pretty good - portions were large and actually pretty filling. I got a fish taco for $5, and for a starter, the size was almost enough to be a full meal. Other people had the poutine and fish and chips which were also large portions. Someone at our table ordered churros and those were excellently done - with a chocolate and marshmallow dip! The decor and environment definitely had quite a bit of character, and keep in mind that their washroom is the basement, right as you enter.  Service was a little bit of a downfall as everything was a little slower than expected/preferred. Food was pretty slow for such a sparse crowd and the bill definitely took around 10 minutes to arrive, which was pretty frustrating."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come here, especially during their summer seasons, Local has a beautifly lit up patio that is in the heart of Liberty Village.  Unfortunately my buddies and I came on a cold spring night lol. Keep in mind if you're coming here anytime after Thursday evening, its always packed.  As a surprise, we didnt have to wait too long considering it was a Friday night and past 10pm...our entourge was able to get a few seats at the bar where we were served without any further delay. Me sticking to my previous drink, I ordered their special house wine (9 0z) and my buddies had a beer... yea.. im pretty healthy. Overall the set up of this place is pretty cool, with the bar as the central focus of the restaurant, though it can be quite intimidating as you come in, since you're right at the top of the stairs looking down at the place lol...kinda like an old nun at bording school looking over at all the students during lunch time haha."}
{"text":"What caught my eye was their rooftop balcony, hence I made it an objective to see what this place was all about.  The Local is a \"local\" trendy bar that has a great selection of food and beer.  The atmosphere is bustling, dim, spacious and friendly.  Their drink menu is extensive, featuring local breweries and some main-stream labels.  They've got their $5 glass of mystery wine RED or WHITE.....  For food we kept it very light. Edamame: quite a good portion sprinkled with salt over it. Not bad   Chips and guacamole: made in house and in front of your eyes by the server.   $5 Mystery Wine.  I'll have to come back here for another trip"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and price was reasonable. We would definitely come back. Music was too loud to really converse."}
{"text":"Are you at Local? Are there seats available? Hurry! Grab them!  Local is one of the busiest places on all of Stephen Ave with their modern pub approach attracting all of the foot traffic walking by. If you try to go at noon or after work, you usually will not be able to find anywhere to sit. The food is worth heading over early though. Their modern approach to classic pub fare is a refreshing change and break from the usual. Although I have not tried everything on the menu, I doubt you could go wrong selecting any of the items on the menu. I'm a big advocate of the fish tacos (get 3 or 4 if you're hungry) if you enjoy deep fried fish in taco form. My friends ordered the sushi grade ahi salad which looked delicious and all of them enjoyed.  Whether you are looking for drinks, snacks, or a whole meal, you'll enjoy your Local experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago for a quick bite before a class I had in the area - they have specials every day - they day I was there it was 2 tacos for $5!  I had the fish taco and the chicken taco - both were good and for the price you can't complain   This location in liberty village is pretty big but extremely busy!  Pretty much every seat was taken.  Loud and energetic this is a great place I imagine to watch a game!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new joint (about 4wks old).  I went here for drinks and to chill with friends.  It's several stories with a rooftop patio (it is opened yet) and they have ping pong tables set up and something else which I forgot.   On Sundays per our server they have a DJ playing in the afternoon, so it looks like they are covering all their bases.  I didn't order any food but from where we were sitting it's an open kitchen so you can see the chefs at work.  The drinks are a reasonable price and they even have a few board games that you can play (I need to work on my Jenga skills!)  Definitely be back to hang out as it's near my hood :)"}
{"text":"Drinks: Great selection of craft beer in bottle and over twenty different craft ale on draught. Large and spacious with friendly locals.  Setting: Outdoor section is covered on benches and tables. Has a bocce pit, good for a few drunken throws. Decor is heavy woods and warm industrial feel.  Is a sports bar with five or six large screens placed visible above the bar and around the indoor area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Top shelf waitresses and decent food.  Would definately go back for another lunch.  I cam see why this place is busy."}
{"text":"Pros: Tasty food Wonderful staff Patio Location  Cons: Busy  Food always takes a while to get to you Loud  Summary: A great place to get some appetizers or dinner and drinks with friends. Not the best for catching up as it's really noisy and hard to hear inside. Other than the noise and slow food service, the food tastes great and makes up for it, and the staff are amazing! So nice and helpful :)  Definitely worth trying their beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with this location. My wife and I went here for a Sunday morning brunch and the service was atrocious. The server Julie R. was slow. She did not acknowledge us for quite some time upon being seated, did not refill our waters appropriately, did not do table checks, and seemed generally uninterested in customer service.   What really bothered me is that I left her a small tip to recognize the unacceptable service (in reality it should have been zero) and she gave me a sarcastic \"thanks\" with an eye roll. Will not be back at this location again."}
{"text":"Wonderful d√©cor (upscale rustic with a bit of a nautical theme), a wall of speakers and TVs viewable from every direction - along with fantastic food - make this a great spot to meet with friends and keep an eye on the game.  Staff are friendly and efficient.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and we were blown away by the burgers.  So blown away we went back the next day for more.    Would I return:  Yes. Would I recommend:  Yes. It's worth going a bit out of the way to get to."}
{"text":"I really need to write an update review right away.  Finally, I come again on a Saturday evening.  The music and atmosphere is good.  The place is  definitely loud today, but the good music wakes me up.    My Favourite shock top is daily special today.  I ordered the ahi tuna sandwich.  Oh my, it is just good.  The large piece of ahi tuna is grilled just perfect.  My another half ordered the press burger.  He enjoyed it so much and his comment is \"stupidly good\".  Love it with free Wifi.  Will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"I used to live at 5 Hanna and we tried to come to dinner here a lot but it was always too busy. Since we have moved I have been here twice and sat at the bar both times. I have never ordered food, just stopped in for a few drinks. Both times the bartender was great! The Caesar is really good for the price when it is on special. There wasn't a beer I fell in love with, but the bartender kept trying. He was so nice to bring sample after sample. I will return."}
{"text":"I don't have a problem with the food drink or drink at local but this pissed me off. I was there on a business meeting which is pretty common and left my sunglasses there. After numerous attempts to call and messages left, I couldn't get a hold of anyone so I went in in person to ask if they had them. I was greeted at the front desk and told \"last week? you are S.O.L buddy\"  She said they get rid of that stuff after a week. Where does it go? I asked, oh the mustard seed or something. Yeah restaurants throw out 1000's of dollars worth of food a day, I'm sure you gave my Oakley's to the mustard seed or 'something'.  It's my fault I forgot them but the complete lack of give a shit or organization surprised me. I guess if  you leave something at Local the wait staff is entitled to it. I was made to feel dumb for even coming to check. Not cool."}
{"text":"The place is soo much fun, great for drinks and a bite of food. Always filled with a great young crowd. Last time I was in there were no tables so my friend and I sat at the bar our bartender Brad was an absolute blast! He was really friendly and helpful and did everything he could to accommodate our needs. I will defiantly be back soon."}
{"text":"I was a bit late to meet up with some friends at LOCAL on 8th Ave so I only had a couple drinks and skipped food. This was my first time visiting LOCAL and despite it being a short experience I couldn't help but notice the warm upbeat atmosphere and great service.  Inside is much bigger than the outside leads you to believe, there's plenty of seating and it doesn't feel too squishy. The d√©cor was interesting, somewhat rustic meets industrial with a little bit of modern flare. The drink menu was quite solid, good selection of craft beer and rotating seasonal beers, they had awesome drink specials as well! Our server was on the ball and was very personable. She went as far as to have an entertaining side conversation about Jurassic World with my friend lol.  Quick sneak-peak this time, but definitely enough for me to want to go back. Hope this is a taste of a great future visit :). Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday (3.50 beer, 7.00 mimosas - YAY).  Atmosphere is casual and fun - seat your self - table we sat at wasn't wiped, there was salt, grains, and water or alcohol all over it.   I had to ask the server (who happened to walk by) for napkins to wipe it ... MYSELF. Then was asked, \"Was that there when you sat down?\", well, I certainly didn't make that mess since we hadn't even put in our first drink or food orders.  Server came by 10-15 minutes after we sat, took our drink orders, then brought our beer 20 minutes later.  Basically, don't come here if you expect any decent service. I'm not sure how long it takes to get beer from the bar to a table but the apps we ordered came out faster.  The two stars are for the cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculously bad service tonight.  2 waitresses and a bartender on the upstairs patio with 7 tables and everyone was waiting for service.   Food was way too salty as well.    Update: September 17/16 Night and day from our last visit.   Reluctantly came in sat at the down at the downstairs bar.  We we're greatequickly by a very polite, friendly but not overbearing bartender with just enough small talk to make us feel comfortable but not intrusive.   Our orders came quickly and the food was good.  So glad they redeemed themselves.  More guys like this bartender would take anyplace a long way."}
{"text":"Just came for a drink before dinner. Busy area but parking was not a problem. As I looked over the wine menu, I saw \"mystery wine\" as one of the selections, your choice of red or white. I had to ask the waitress if anyone ever orders it. All she said was, \"yeah.\" Ok. Fine. I was feeling adventurous. I had the mystery white for 5. You know what? It wasn't bad. Plus it was happy hour so more savings. I like."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the rude waitress who didn't seem to care about her tables enough I would have given a better rating. Customer service will make or break a place. Food was ok though."}
{"text":"Fun Place!  We arrived late afternoon before heading to Molson Amphitheater for a concert.  the place was already filling up both inside and out.  We sat at the bar, and despite the bustle, the service was attentive and friendly.  This is a big space, with an outdoor bocce and indoor shuffleboard court.  Many flat-screens (30?) adorn the walls making it an above average venue to watch an event.  Only a couple of minor snafu's that didn't really detract from the experience, but are worth mentioning: an order of wings arrived at our table that we didn't order.  This led to a delay in the appetizer we DID order arriving simultaneous to our entrees.  No big deal as the food was great.  The drink menu is extensive, and the craft beer selection is both contemporary and varied.  A great place before heading to BMO Field, CNE or Rogers Center.  We will be back."}
{"text":"If the bocce court doesn't give away that it's going to be a little pretentious and hipsterish, nothing will - but hey, you know, it's got good beer and good food, and it's not too pricey. My favourite place? No. But if I for some reason find my way over to Liberty Village, it's somewhere I'd consider."}
{"text":"Those burgers... I worked in Liberty Village for a few months earlier this year and had daily cravings for Local burgers (no lie). Yes, there aren't that many great places to eat in the area but I really have not found a pub in Toronto that serves tastier burgers. The burgers are cooked to perfection and seasoned well with a plump bun. The Press burger was my go-to (that miso mayo is perfect).  The staff is quite friendly here and the area has a fun and chill vibe. The rotating beer selection is a sweet touch. They also have an outdoor patio with lights strung above and a heater for the winter. Note that this place is a popular option in Liberty Village and is often super packed after work hours so get there early!  I can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"I have a up and down feeling for Liberty Village. On one hand, it's often pretentious and overpriced, frequented by d-bags and lacks the vibe of places like Queen West, it's neighbor to the not so distant northeast. On the other hand, I've had some pretty good food experiences there at prices that are only a bit off of what you pay in the elsewhere's of Toronto, so maybe the overpriced thing doesn't always apply? I'm a bit torn. But of the places I've been, I was fairly impressed with the Local.  If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll notice there's one thing I consistently favor....and that's consistency! Naturally, quality goes long with that. The first time I went to The Local, I was totally impressed. Good burger, fries and a pretty decent salad. Service was quick and our waitress was friendly and helpful. Price was what I expected and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. I'd give that one four stars. But the next visit was just ok. Nothing special, just ok. Burger didn't seem to be handmade (maybe I just remembered incorrectly?) and like Liberty Village itself, the whole thing felt very formulaic and designed. It was nothing special, just ho-hum. I was left wondering which one of my experiences was the real one: the awesome first or the so-so second.  Service was good but not great the second visit. Place was quiet due to it being lunch so it was difficult to judge the atmosphere, but overall even with the lack of consistency I'd still say it's worth trying out. Points in favor would be the cool layout, very industrial loft style setting and it's good for friends. Check it out, and decide for yourself it's door no.1 or 2"}
{"text":"Saturday brunch: brutal experience. Unprofessional, insensitive, and inaccurate menu.   I went there with my infant son, looking forward to their banana pancakes (the only thing my son could eat there). Though I tried calling ahead to ensure they had the pancakes available, no one answered the phone and instead I got voice mail: the \"The Local\" is not available. No kidding. The Local is too busy raking cash from its patrons to pick up the phone and address my concerns. I decided to risk going there without confirming over the phone: big mistake!  I arrived with my son and was seated. We settled and I got him settled into a high chair, drinking some water, playing a bit, given he was getting cranky as he was hungry and looking forward to his pancakes. The server arrived and asked for our drink order. I ordered coffee. About 10  minutes later, she returns and assures me that the coffee is on its way and asked for my food order. I asked for two orders of banana pancakes, to which she quickly replied that they were out and apologized for not mentioning this any earlier to us. At this point, we were seated for about 25 minutes, hungry and with a baby getting increasingly upset.   I told the server I had called and no one picked up, specifically to ensure that they had the pancakes, given there was nothing else for my son to eat there. She remained silent. She went somewhere to double check and returned confirming that they were out of pancakes. She said \"I'm sorry\" and walked away.   Wow! \"I'm sorry\"? That's it? I just lugged my infant in the dead of winter to your restaurant, promised him pancakes, settled him, delayed his lunch schedule, and all you can say is \"I'm sorry\" and walk away? And, not like I didn't try to be proactive and call the restaurant ahead of time to specifically avoid this experience.   I don't think I have enough negative adjectives to describe how ridiculous that response was.   Anyway, we packed up and left the restaurant, upset and hungry.   Terrible."}
{"text":"So came here for dinner before heading out downtown.  Usually this place is packed with a huge wait, but this time it looked decent.  So we went to have a drink by the shuffleboard table and wait and the host said he would call us when he has a table.  Now at the back there was two free tables.  After having a drink, and the tables still open, i asked someone if we can grab it.  They came back and said it was free.  Sitting at the table, we waited for ten minutes  for someone to come buy and bring us menu's.  I eventually went to the bar to ask for menu's for the table.  When it came to order, we ordered Wings for appetizers, and all three of us an entree (local burgers, taco's, fish and chips).  We also ordered a round of beers.  The beers took 15 minutes to come.....  We got our entrees first.  Half way through we assumed the wings were not entered.  So we asked the waitress to cancel the wings as by time we saw one, we were pretty much done our burgers (defeats the point of appetizers)  We were told she would make sure they are not on the bill (because lets face it, it was never entered)  Positives: the beer was cold, and very well priced and a great selection.   The burger i had was good.  the side salad was awfully small compared to other places. The patio is nice  Negatives: the service.  Slow or non existent service.  This is always a huge deal breaker.  I gave it 3 stars over 2 , because the atmosphere and location would bring me back, especially if williams landing is packed, or if i want a patio in Liberty village."}
{"text":"I work in Liberty Village and have eaten 100s of times in each of the places around here.  I was excited to see that Local Public Eatery has open, because other locations are actually good.  Well, this one isn't.  From the very start, there was no one to seat me or tell me to seat myself, so I stood upright for 15 minutes, before walking over to the bar and figuring it out.  Their beer comes in 14oz portions (a pint is 18 ounces) and  they charge full-pint prices.  However, all 'fancy' places do this, so I could live with it.  What I could not live with is the $18 steak sandwich which came with the tiniest little piece of steak I've ever seen!  The waitress claimed that the steak will be 8oz, but the piece I got was no more than 4-5.  It was served on a plain white bread, with some tomatoes on the side! That's it for $18!!  I ordered the soup side and it came in the tiniest little cup you've ever seen.  I think cups so tiny are only used for condiments otherwise.  Yes, I understand Liberty Village is overpriced, so restaurants think they can get away with anything, but not so fast, my friends!  There's Caffino near King and Mildred's near  Strachan which ARE actually high-end places and serve amazing food!  A T-Bone steak at Caffino's is $22 and it is a 14oz amazing steak!  There are better options around for food."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with your crew after work, happy hour is HAPPY;)"}
{"text":"So we were in the Liberty Village Area, and found out that there is a new restaurant that just opened up. Local Public Eatery looked new and hip. We walked in and liked the atmosphere, very urban but had hint of rodeo with their jugs and wooden furniture.   One funny thing we encountered was a table of guys that hit on anything that walked and had long hair. This place was not a lounge yet they made it their own personal VIP by talking to customers and waitresses. They went even as far as hitting on some guy's daughters as they were all leaving the restaurant. Can you say...desperation?? Anyways I'm a little off topic, back to the review!!  We started off by ordering some ice cold beer. We got the Muskoka Detour. Beer is always a great appetizer. I got The Brooklyn Burger (Fcuk Brooklyn though) it was the burger that the our server Tressa suggested. The burger was delicious. It had 3 years aged cheddar with onion rings and red pepper relish that added sweetness to the burger. The gf ordered The Ahi Tuna Sandwich. It had the tuna steak with avocado, tomato, lettuce, and bacon. That sandwich was amazing and I would recommend it. We ordered fries as our sides as they ran out of yam fries:( The fries kinda reminded me of McDonalds' fries, but I'm sure they would actually rot unlike McDonalds' super fries. Back to our server Tressa, she provided excellent service and wasn't too bad looking either ;) Overall this experience was fantastic giving it a well deserved 5 stars. Also it turns out Local Public Eatery is a sister company of Joeys. Everyone stop by and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary for a single night on my way to the Yukon, and the Fish Tacos are THE BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE - I'm serious.  Eat those."}
{"text":"Located in Liberty Village, this local sports bar is a busy place with an open patio and lots of sitting area.  They have an outdoor game which makes it entertaining to watch others play or if your familiar with it, you join in the fun (sorry have no clue what this game is called)  Food was served in portions similar to a high end restaurant. So not your average sports bar.   It was however, very delicious. I had the burger with sweet potato fries. My sister had the burger with a salad and my mom had a chicken salad ( quite small not filling)  Service was at a good pace and the staff were friendly.   Music was definitely retro 80's, not complaining brought back memories and my mom enjoyed it.   This is a great place for an outing with a group of friends.   The reason I gave it a 4 star was because the table wobbled so much, that it didn't make a difference when the waitress put a stack of coasters under it. Therefore we had to be very careful with our drinks.   On that note I will still eat here again and make sure to do a wobble table test before sitting down  ;)  Happy eatings :)"}
{"text":"Mildred's Temple Kitchen had a 2 hour wait for brunch, so we went to Local Public Eatery as a fall-back plan. Everything we ordered came quickly and tasted great, including the house Caesars. Overall a nice pub with a fun atmosphere. I'm sure the patio is great in the summer, too."}
{"text":"I like the easy going neighborhood vibe of this pub. There are plenty of seats both inside and outside, so you can choose if you want your sun exposure for the day or not.   We came on a Saturday afternoon hoping to catch the soccer game and thankfully they had several large television screens which were visible from pretty much any seat on the floor. We sat at the bar, were promptly served our drinks and the staff checked in every so often to make sure were were okay.   Extra star for the diversity of patrons and the staff's friendly easy-going demeanor that made everyone fell welcomed. There was a child's birthday party at the long table, single male patrons loitering at the bar, families with their kids, several couples watching the game and groups of regulars (knew the staff by name). The most impressive was when a group of 5 young kids (like maybe grade 6 age? they were so tiny their heads barely reached the bar standing up) came in, noisily crowded the bar, energetically waved down the bartender and ordered a plate of nachos. The bartender was polite, bent down to their level to speak with them, offered them water, informed them that they couldn't be seated on the rooftop patio when asked (but why??? they all chorused) and offered to set them up comfortablly at one of the tables instead. Very impressive!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars based on the excellent food and beer and wine selection. This has all makings of a great local pub. Great tacos, burgers and sandwiches (jerk was v good). Solid beer selection including locals and good wines at various price points. Upbeat atmosphere.   The problem is the service. Friendly but totally ineffective. Although there's plenty of servers it's almost impossible to get the attention of one. Really detracts from the experience. Maybe it's opening weeks but they need to fix this.   We are local residents and many of our friends in the area have found he same thing.   Go for the food and drink and ignore the service. Four stars otherwise."}
{"text":"After wrapping up an event at the CNE, we decided to head there for a quick bite before driving/parking on the Gardiner/404 to our trek home. The tacos were on special - $2.50 each. Based on the price, i wasn't expecting much, but what a surprise. Fresh, great taste and perfect amount of meat,cabbage, sauce, topping. The nachos came next which were OK. Not bad but nothing to rave about either. I guess the tacos set the standard high.  Service is amazing. From the moment you walk in to the time you leave. And the place is comforting. Great to come and hang out with friends. Will come back for sure to try other items."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for food and drink. I live in Liberty village and I'm thrilled to have this place near me. Food is fresh and tasty, service is friendly and fast even on busy days."}
{"text":"Welcome to Leaside Local. Went here for burgers on the weekend and they were really tasty (warning for the faint of heart - they are Huge). Service was really good, the staff were all very friendly and the manager even came by and introduced himself. They have a great upstairs 'sun-room'/patio upstairs and the decore is very comfy and welcoming. Next time I'll try the Huevos Racheros, saw someone else order it and it looked delish. Just a note though that this is Leaside, lots and lots of kids here (I counted 25 in the hour we were here) can u please create a healthier kids menu!"}
{"text":"This is a review based on what it is, a chain-like place. It is definitely better than a few of it's counterparts. I would actually give it a 4/5 but thats for the corporate-chain restaurant category. They have a lot of beer options, I don't drink beer but that seems to be a crowd thing here.   I've tried a couple things here, it is definitely a good option in the area it's in. I recommend the burgers, out of these types of restaurants they're a good meat with actual colour and it's a nice portion. Things like their fries are also fresher and better tasting than similar type restaurants.   The service has ranged from ok to very good, they're new and already busy, might need to manage that a little better. For my allergy they were very accommodating which is of course great. They are sometimes slow but they let you linger and don't rush you out which i appreciate.   My complaints about the place are the usual for these chain restaurants, over selling flavours but keeping it to safe/bland in the spice and flavour (for the masses i guess). The range of flavours described on menu's never really blend together but are really like safe hip toppings. If your a good cook you're always kind of well that was \"ok\" but the food is simple to replicate or make better at home. Drinks/cocktails are also always seem watered down and overpriced, beer seems to be the better option."}
{"text":"We ordered the ceasar salad- it was good, the chicken on top was OKAY 1 fish taco - AMAZING - quite filling for something so small 1 chicken taco - also great!! (fish was better) highly recommend, great for apps or drinks before going out. The atmosphere is also nice:)"}
{"text":"The food is very blah. The fries are fries you can get anywhere, and they weren't even good. The burger was very plain, and the drink I ordered was drowned in alcohol, which seems to be the trend in Toronto. The waitress didn't come around very often, and it wasn't even a busy night. You can do so much better. Go elsewhere. You're doing yourself a huge favour."}
{"text":"Fancied a quick bite with a good beer and Local did the trick. Great beer (last first) and the chicken sandwich with yam fries were delicious... Ask for extra  napkins. Service was good (Christina) and the place has atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for pub food! I had one of their salad entree with steak. The steak was cooked to what I had requested, medium rare. It was tender and cooked just right. The salad dressing was also delicious! Pricewise, it's about what you'd expect at a pub in Liberty Village. Everything was about $15-$20 for lunch. Service was fast and food came pretty promptly during lunch time."}
{"text":"Slow service during brunch on Sunday but worst of all their freshly squeezed orange juice tasted like Tropicana."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had! The divine fresh vegetables with the perfectly cooked patty was a wonderful explosion of flavor in my mouth. The service was personal and very fast, our waitress was fast for anything we asked for and very nice. She filled the nice Canadian stereotype. If I ever go back to Toronto this is the restaurant I will return to."}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday (March 15, 2016).  Beers on tap , $4-$5.50.   Good selection, local & imported.   Served cold!  Ordered:   -chicken wings, $12. -tuna poke, $13. -fish and chips, $15.50.   Very crispy batter. -tortilla soup, $5.50  Overall, the food would have been ok if they were not salty!  Even the tortillas were salty.  The ambiance was nice for drinking."}
{"text":"Terribly slow service. Waiting 45 minutes for two simple brunch dishes on a Sunday morning when the place is not even a third full - waitress is inattentive and vacant on autopilot.  Food was ok once it arrived but huevos rancheros and a fried egg sandwich do not warrant such a long wait.   Side note - there is no sign indicating that patrons, once they enter the place, are to seat themselves. People stand there waiting for someone to acknowledge them but staff make no attempt to advise that it's seat oneself service."}
{"text":"Came here for a late brunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was super hot out but we opted for the rooftop patio which was super nice. I had the huevos rancheros which was tasty. A nice surprise was it came with some tortilla chips! Service was generally quick and attentive. Overall, this is an above average pub but the rooftop patio was great! I would visit again."}
{"text":"Great place to check out during patio season. They have a fairly spacious patio and lots of seating inside as well. This is great for groups and just hanging out as well.   Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon, waited about 10-15 minutes for a table on the patio. This place offers drink specials daily and the food menu has a good variety. There are many items on the menu that are great for sharing.   Good service here and food was fresh. Beer was on par, they offer a good variety of beers on tap along with rotating taps also cans/bottles as well. I got the Blanche De Chambly (The special for Sunday was $1.00 off). My boyfriend and I ordered the Fish Taco and Pulled Pork Poutine - both were quite good. Portions are average, definitely good for sharing.   I would recommend this place and wouldn't mind coming back to try their burgers - which looked quite delicious! Come here and enjoy a drink on the patio!"}
{"text":"Woo, gotta love Stampede. Drove into Calgary and met up with my sister who was hanging out at Local for some after work eats. Place was packed - seems like a pretty chill place to hangout if you work downtown. They have a shuffle board (it's the new thing, get with the times yo).  Anyways, for food, I was able to get a couple bites/tastes of:  - #1 Sushi grade ahi salad ($15) - seared tuna with tomatoes, olives, goat cheese and pine nuts. Pretty darn good idea to have ahi tuna in salad! - Tijuana chicken caesar salad ($12) - typical Caesar salad with spiced croutons and parmesan. - Fully loaded nachos ($18) - pulled chicken with sour cream, avocado, jack cheese and some other things. Better than your typical bar nachos.  Then for myself, I was still hungry so I ordered: - Tuna club sandwich ($16) + yam fries ($1 extra) - ahi tuna with smoked bacon, avocado and melted cheddar. GENIUS. Ahi tuna club sandwich? Genius bar food. Oh wait, I said that already. Anyways, it was really good and pretty big portion. The sauce for the yam fries was bomb - truffle oil and like mayo aioli type dip. YUM.  Pretty darn good bar food with a cool, packed atmosphere and a shuffled board for all you people that need some entertainment while you eat/drink."}
{"text":"I had no idea that this was a Joey's chain as it really reminded me of Original Joe's. Although maybe Joey's owns them too and I just have no idea? Who knows. Either way it's a solid choice. Lots of great items to choose from and tons of different beer if that is your thing. Beer isn't my thing, but I always appreciate the selection.   The service was super slow when we were there and it wasn't really that busy. I seem to find this a trend in Calgary though so I always gear myself up to wait. I usually try to order two things at once. When my food comes, make sure you get another drink. When that drink comes make sure you ask for the bill. When the bill comes tell her you need the debit machine - you get the picture.  The location on 8th Ave is great and it has a nice little patio out front. It was one of the busiest places on the street so just for the atmosphere I would keep coming back."}
{"text":"Where to begin?  This is a bar on the edge of Leaside, populated by young families.   Recent visit saw an indifferent server (phoney green contact lenses, you are not fooling anyone honey) who was much more interested in serving young guys who were running up high alcohol tabs than families.  Children NOT welcome here.  Terrible service, our server took forever to serve us at 3:30 on a Sunday, when place was literally empty.  Meal was two hours long.  Highlights: got my drink order wrong, did not return forever, finally flagged someone else down to change it and I was charged for both drinks on the tab, my daughter had mustard on her burger (one of the very few things on the menu that's kid-friendly) and ate 1/4 of it as a result (manager removed it from bill, which was much appreciated), server NEVER returned to ask how meal was and never brought water for the table, so I had to BEG the fellow who brought our food out for water!  She finally came by after two hours with the bills, placed them on the table without so much as a thank you or whatever it is they are trained to say.  This is when we discovered the drink error and after about five minutes of waiting my husband went to the bar where someone else corrected it.  Even when my husband confronted her about her shitty service she said absolutely nothing, rang us out, and walked away!  She got $0 tip.  First time in ten years it warranted it.  This was hands down the worst experience I have had ever ever ever at an eatery in Toronto.  This place is NOT for you if: you are more than 28 years old, have one or more children, want good value for money (do not get the steak sandwich unless you also plan to order three more items), give a shit about value for money or good service.  So basically, the majority of people in Leaside.  Note to the manager/owner: weekend drinkers and brunchers will not be enough to sustain you if you can't cater to the affluent families that sustain your neighbourhood every single day of the week, so consider creating a kids menu of a few items, and train your staff not to be jerks (check on the customer more than once an hour, and write down the orders for the love of GOD so they are correct).  Otherwise I guarantee that they (we) will take our money to any number of other eateries in the area including Against the Grain which is infinitely better.  I will check in again in one year to see if this place survived."}
{"text":"Like most things in Liberty, this place isn't cheap.   Service was pretty sub par (my friend tried to order steamed veggies on the side and distinctly said NO SALAD, and he was told that they didn't do that....seriously, he said he'd be happy with some celery and carrot sticks....and then he was brought a salad) and ambience is homey (local bar without the grunge feel).   The food is great! Most things are super fresh and well prepared:  - fish and chips were hot, crisp, and the fish was still soft and moist in the middle - the burger was hot and well seasoned with fresh toppings -the tuna club was disappointing, the sandwich was well composed, but the tuna was overdone and not well seasoned.   Beer and cocktails were delicious :)"}
{"text":"The environment and the patio is very nice, however the food needs improvement. The chicken Taco was very salti and the burger patty was over cooked. Over all a nice place to hangout with friends and have drinks but not for dining."}
{"text":"Having lived in Leaside for about 23 years and then moving out of Toronto recently, my friend and I decided to visit the Local Eatery in January. I had passed by it a bunch of times but never went in, and my friend had been there one or two times and had enjoyed the atmosphere but had never taken in the food. So my friend and I arrived at around 7 pm; service was just ramping up, downstairs was packed, the upstairs was almost packed but there were some couches and recliners to sit on, which I thought was interesting.   We were served our drinks, and the music selection on the night was a mix of alternative, indie and maybe some hip-hop, I enjoy all genres but I remember them playing some Queens of the Stone Age, which was fantastic.   My friend ordered the wings and I ordered the LOCAL Burger. The Wings were $11.50/lbs and The LOCAL Burger for $14.50; Cheddar and Jack cheese, hot sauce, pickled jalape√±os & onions, and a side of fries. When the orders arrived I glanced at my friend's plate and thought, \"Gosh, that doesn't look like a pound of wings, look how minuscule it looks, I have seen bigger wings for half the price at places in Scarborough\". I guess because of the rent, taxes in the area, the clientele just ordering drinks most of the time, food is just an afterthought, and is quite expensive compared to what you can attain in other areas of Toronto.   This notion was reaffirmed when I bit into my burger. It was pretty messy, and the cheese wasn't really melted, it had been grated but not melted on the patty, with all the toppings it sort of tasted like the watered down salsa of an Old El Paso Taco kit. It wasn't really appealing, but I ate in nonetheless, but it just felt slapped together and had no good flavour notes.  Both my friend and I were still not sated by the orders and were left wanting more. I would recommend this place for the atmosphere but not for the food. If you want better food go up or down Laird or go onto Bayview."}
{"text":"Id like to give Local more stars, my first meal there was a joy. But when I brought back more family members for my next meal, the lost our order between the computer and the kitchen, and let us sit 40 minutes before doing anything. Our meals were comped, but I'd rather just pay for a good, timely meal that wait forever for nothing. Food the second time was pretty lousy, too."}
{"text":"Food at a LOCAL was actually quite good! I enjoyed my crispy chicken burger and stole a couple potatoes from my friends brunch which were great.   However it was service that put my experience down to a 2 star. We entered the restaurant and stood around for about 10 mins until I went down to ask got a server to get us seated. We were seated at the bar and our server was rude and not happy to be serving us.   Food took around 50 minutes to come! They brought the wrong food to our table twice and when they took it back, they didn't even apologize, just grabbed our plates. We did end up getting a new server (not sure why) who was very nice, explained to us it was a bit understaffed today in the kitchen and such. Unfortunately our experience was already down the drain."}
{"text":"Kati C, our waitress was most attentive and friendly as we sat outside this wonderful Stephan Avenue pub and enjoyed Gypsy Tears Red Ale in the cool evening of a Calgary Summer Day among the Beautiful People unwinding from their busy days of being gorgeous."}
{"text":"Great spot for a bite and some tasty beers in Liberty Village. My buddy and I grabbed lunch here before a TFC game on a beautiful, sunny Saturday... the wait was about 10 minutes which is totally fine given that TFC and PanAm were going on. (There is always a line at this place as far as I know)  We sat at the bar - tons of big screens for the sports fans out there. Next time we'll have to wait the extra few minutes and sit on the patio with its communal-style picnic tables and bocci ball.  Boneshaker and Shock Top were \"on special\" at $4.50 a pint, and really, how can you go wrong with that? I had the crispy chicken sandwich and it was on point!! The coleslaw was excellent and I loved that it had fennel in it... a special ingredient in my own coleslaw ;) The fries were delicious as well.  Some other reviewers mentioned it can get loud here - I guess so, but then again you're not going to this type of restaurant for a quiet meal before the theatre. A great option in Lib Village and much better than Williams Landing or Brazen Head IMHO!"}
{"text":"Start working in liberty village And this is An amazing spot. Been here around 5 times in the past 3 mths and it never disappoints. Edamame is amazing, good tacos and salads. Veggie burger was great and the crispy chicken sandwich is great but huge. Really well priced and great patio. Def worth a visit."}
{"text":"The guacamole The tuna club The burgers The salads The brunch The nachos The edamame  The tuna poke (I think it's since been removed ) The coffee The beer selection  And the staff.   It's an easy 'go to' place that's sure to satisfy any palate, a wide variety of people can be seen enjoying this hot spot from business lunches, date night, watching the game w friends, Patio season (it's the best in LV) Or before a game of concert, just consistent great people and food."}
{"text":"Great spot! We took our 8.5 month old daughter here, she slept while we had delicious brunch!   Our ordered brunch menu:  We had two fish tacos Fresh guacomole (chunky)  Brooklyn burger  Banana pancakes  Let's start with the Ambiance. It's great, music plays, noise is about medium, which was perfect for our daughter, it's a really chill place, love the decor.   Food! My husband was here for the first time yesterday and told me that he was jones'n for the fish tacos, so we came back today! Fish tacos were light crispy and packed with flavor! The guacomole was chunky and delicious. They make it for you right at the table. It's slightly lemony with fresh tomatoes and cilantro. The burger! Yum! The meat was very tasty and did not taste frozen at all. Big plus! They put thick onion rings which make it so much better! Finally the pancakes. Whenever I get banana pancakes I usually feel like I can never get enough bananas! In each bite of this pancake, you get sooo much banana! I loved it. If you're not the biggest fan of banana, these are not for you. We also got Orange juice that seemed freshly sqeezed. Can't say for sure, but I enjoyed it!   Lastly service! They were really friendly, and the food came out super quick! This is a quality that my husband and I appreciate so much considering we have an infant with us. Time is definitely of the essence. We were asked several times if our food was of our liking and our drinks were always filled.   We would definitely come back! It's rare when you find a spot where the service and food are spectacular and there's not a long wait. This spot just opened so the wait time may change as more people find out but for now, we just sat ourselves and jumped right in to eating!   Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Calgary. I'm addicted to the fish tacos. I have tried almost everything on the menu and I haven't been disappointed. The prices are great for the quality. Excellent beer selection and an awesome staff. HIGHLY recommend LOCAL on 8th!!"}
{"text":"They have the best fish tacos ever! Seriously good.. And their beer menu is intense with so many different kinds! Always packed though, but defiantly worth the wait"}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed! Everything you want from a Pub. Happening, alive, entertaining. With really good service, decent *pub* food, a great variety of alcoholic beverages, good looking servers, loud music (but not too loud), etc etc.  On the weekends, during lunch hour,or right after work, if you can get a seat, go for it !"}
{"text":"This is my favourite spot in Liberty Village. I love the vibe, the food is good but it's the caesars that keep bringing my back. It's called the El Caesar and it's incredible. Lots of horseradish, comes with lots of garnishes and it's nice and spicy. Also, a great patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Always a good time! The food, drinks, and servers are always on point - wish I lived closer but definitely my top choice when I'm in the neighbourhood :-)"}
{"text":"Me likey!!!  I had lunch with my girls Jenn N. and Raissa R. here during the first week of Stampede. The place was bumpin', but we managed to score a table in the back right near the kitchen. I was surprised to learn that this was a part of the JOEY chain, I enjoyed the atmosphere and couldn't help but notice the amount of cooks in the kitchen and servers running around. Being that it was Stampede, that's expected, but it was nice to see everyone working hard to get things running smoothly.   We ordered a couple of cocktails - Caesars - which were served in adorable boot mugs. They were garnished with a green bean, olives, and a pepperoni stick and were DELISH! I also tried one of the lemonade cocktails and enjoyed it as well.   Our meals were burgers with fries, as well as a Chicken Sandwich. Food came out quickly, which was appreciated during a busy lunch hour! The consensus was that everyone loved their food. The burger was HUGE, messy, and delicious! I actually saved half for my boyfriend as I was too full to finish, and he raved about how great it was eating it over an hour later! The bacon was so thick and crispy, I actually contemplated coming back and only ordering a plate of bacon. I loved the shoestring style fries, which came in a bucket - cute! On top of everything, our server was super sweet and our bill was extremely reasonable.   I'm loving LOCAL so far and will make it my go-to lunch spot while working DT. it would also make a great spot to meet friends after work for drinks."}
{"text":"I don't spend much time in Liberty Village but since my car was detailed 1 block away I decided to have lunch at Local.   I arrived shortly after they opened. As I went inside I had to look around to find a waitress to direct me to a table. I will assume there was no hostess because still early but maybe something to work on.   They have a nice dining room and a very spacious patio. The menu has a basic selection that has mostly popular dishes. Special mention to the menu presented has a folded Toronto Map.  My waitress was nice and personable. I was debating between the Deluxe Burger or the Tijuana salad. She said she could combine both, great! She also came often to check on me.  Burger was very tasty (4/5) but somewhat very juicy / greasy so eat it fast! My hands became so full of oil/sauce that I decided to finish it with a fork and knife. The bun was nicely baked and it's also made in house, a great touch from a chain restaurant.   The Tijuana Ceasar had a nice kick as well (4/5). I just wish I could taste the avocado a bit more in the dressing. A somewhat bigger portion would be great too.   The only little let down was that they only offered brewed coffee. A espresso machine is not only a great investment, it's a necessity!   Overall I am happy with my experience."}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos and good drink specials. Arielle gave great service. Also she has great hair."}
{"text":"I have been here few times since they opened last year. Tried most items on the menu including brunch menu. My favourites are their tacos,  chicken sandwich and fish and chips. Weekend nights and brunch can be busy. Food is not too consistent. My burger was really well done and dry on my last visit. My server didn't check on the meal and when we mentioned it later, he said we should have let him know. Really??"}
{"text":"I've been to Local a few times before when I was in the area. I don't frequent Liberty Village too much unless there is a specific place in mind. I've come on a Sunday for their Caesar specials and just a weekday evening for pub food.   The last visit I had was for dinner on a weekday night. Pretty busy. Waitress was good at keeping up and the food was good. I had the typical pressed burger with sweet potato fries. Really flavorful burger and I love the taste of the bun. It's not cooked through so ensure you ask for well done if you don't like to see pink!"}
{"text":"There are many pluses to LOCAL Public Eatery. The location is convenient, along Laird, where there can be a lack of restaurants. There is a great variety to their menu with many twists on the traditional pub menu. The jerk chicken sandwich was wonderfully delicious and had a serious kick. However, the service was disappointing both times we decided to try it out. Our waitresses was not well trained, often not knowing the names and company that produced the craft beer they have on tap. We had to ask for water several times before having enough for the whole table. I feel that water should be compulsory at restaurants, that should come to the table when menus are dropped off. Meals would arrived at the table extremely staggered, with some of our dishes coming so tardy that most of us had finished already. We also had to ask for our bills several times, it took almost 45 minutes for all of us to wrap up our bills. I hope that this level of service is a function of the restaurant being new. It definitely let's the place down, because I feel the food deserves at least 3.5/5 stars. I might wait a couple more months before I even think of going back to let them iron out kinks, if they can."}
{"text":"Nice new place - service is relaxed, but attentive and the menu has a decent variety of dishes. Kitchen is probably still fine-tuning as it was a little slow, but made up with good dishes and drink service that was quick.   Burgers are huge, but sliders filled in fine for the kids. I had a chopped salad that was portioned well and tasty without being a mish-mash."}
{"text":"My favorite bar we visited in the area. It's casual but filled with great people. If you're single and looking to mingle or want to throw back some drinks and play some games with friends, this is the bar to go to. We stayed here for a while and had a great time watching TV and watching the crowd! If I lived in the area, this would be my go to bar."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos all day long!!! Food here is good, never had a bad meal and I've eaten there a bunch of times.... Generally order the same things because they're so good, you crave them. Drinks are good, no complaints. Staff is usually quite good and on top of it, even on really busy nights. My only criticism is that this place can get LOUD! If you're not in the mood to be deafened go elsewhere. Otherwise it truly is a neighbourhood hot spot where you will see a slew of regulars."}
{"text":"Came here with friends, and was blown back by how loud and busy this place was. The only seats they had available were at the bar so we sat there. The menu has lots to offer.   I had the burger and it was great. I believe they make the bread there and its amazing, definitely not wonder bread. It was large and filling, It was good and I'd want to try a few more items off the menu so I will be back for sure.   The staff is all super friendly which is great. The only issue is that since its so loud if theres anyone annoying around you, you are stuck hearing their entire conversation while you're there."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Great for some shareables with some friends. Staff and management team are super friendly and helpful. Amazing that they're trying to keep everything \"local\". ;)"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon the Local from our hotel (Fairmont Palliser) and had an excellent experience. Tasty tacos, tortilla soup and salads - really yummy food made in an open kitchen. Our server Megan was extremely warm and friendly and made our first dining experience ever in Calgary very memorable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"ORDER: shocktop beer (sat special at $4.50) tuna sandwich + salad (other side opt are reg fries or yam fries+$1) shared half nachos (would recommend)  PROS: delicious in its entirety  atmosphere nice large patio with heaters  multiple tv screens for the game (40\" ish) diverse menu busy but not too busy (no table wait)  CONS: needs less dressing on salad and sandwich needs less salt on fries (mcd style but slightly saltier) great music playing but a little too loud for my old age not fond of the tap water  total for one, $25 for brunch"}
{"text":"Great patio and selection of beer.  Always a good spot, especially in the summer"}
{"text":"Great, happening spot in Liberty Village. Despite always being busy and packed with people, the customer service is excellent. It's the only place I've been to where the waitress asked our names as soon as we sat down. I've only had a few appetizers (tacos, calamari, etc.) but intend to return for dinner. Get there early to avoid a wait!"}
{"text":"Local is the local hero in my opinion. Have yet to have a poor experience here. Just popped in for brunch today with 3 lady's after a post Blue Jay's jam I hosted. We had steak and eggs, eggs Benedict, chicken and fish tacos and a salad. All of it was amazing. My girl is a taco connoisseur and she loves the chicken tacos here. They make pretty good house Caesar too."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd enjoy a Joey's chain this much. But LOCAL (not to be confused with Local 510, 002 or 522 which are part of the Concorde Group... also using the star in their logo... not to be confused with the star used on either NATIONAL. When did the branding on bars get so confusing?) is following a good model and I like the vibe they're bringing to Stephen Ave.   Low key, gastropub-style, big venue, lots of tables, plenty of drinks on tap and servers that can still stay on top of friendly conversation on a busy night. Menu items range from nachos, gyoza, yam fries and the likes to burgers, sandwiches, salads, tacos and a small weekend brunch menu. If you're in from out of town, take the menu with you... it's a map of downtown!  On the drinks side, might I suggest a drink in a boot? Wonder how many of those were consumed last week during Stampede... the Baja Margarita does the trick for me. Not up for a boot? It's all good, the next drink category is called... wait for it... \"... Not In A Boot.\" You can also order yourself a round of Bombers (tasty shots), cask shots, or your regular wine and beer.  I have a hard time plugging the \"purveyors of fine beer and tap wine\" tagline with so many money beers like bud and coors light, but there are some local beers on there (like Village and Alley Kat). As far as your regular beer drinker goes, you'll likely enjoy the selection.  Tip: The nachos come with lots of toppings... but could use a few more nachos to eat the rest of the toppings with!"}
{"text":"We had supper this evening at the Local Public Eatery.  The patio was jammed  I ordered a burger and fries.   I hadn't had a burger there before and it was a good burger.  I'd get it again.  Gord had a Crispy Chicken Sandwich (that's what I've had when I've been there before) and a side salad.  He said he's get it again.  Steve had the Local burger and sweet potato fries.  He said it was a good burger, a bit spicier than he was expecting.  Simone got the fish and chips.  She said it was good ... it looked good!  It was a lotta fish!  Kate was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"A business lunch was in order for a group of staff.  I made the reservations and called ahead to have an assortment of apps ready upon our arrival.  Good on their word the apps arrived along with our drinks.  There was a great selection and slowly we were filling up on these tasty treats.  When I said to everyone to order their main they were surprised to get such huge portions.  Every dish ordered was hot, fresh and tasty.  I ordered what I thought was a simple burger.  The meat was so fresh it was falling apart.  I barely could get my mouth around it.  Having craved a good burger for a while my craving was more than satisfied.  Staff were all amazing and attentive.  Great upbeat atmosphere. We finished off our lunch with Cinnamon Churros with a hazelnut marshmallow dipping sauce. Need I say more!! They offer a great brunch menu for Saturdays and Sundays from 10:00 a.m.  Thank you Local Public Eatery Staff you were awesome."}
{"text":"Went for a drink and app, sat on the ground patio, cold calamari, my hubby's $8 poutine was the smallest and saddest dish we've ever seen.  He originally ordered the pulled pork poutine but several minutes later our sever came out and she said they are not serving this today um ok.    His beer was fine, my easy white wine spritzer with lemon was turned into asking me if I want the one on the menu served with berries??!?  No with lemon, of course my drink came out with no lemon ugh.  The most concerning was the clearly over served guys who kept coming out to smoke in the parking lot and going to their truck to get the smokes thank you for standing so close to us. Even more concerning was the guy and his baby, just the two of them, him drinking beers then leaving with the baby in a car seat, buckle strap of seat dragging on the ground then proceeding to leave the parking lot in his truck and getting honked at more than once.  Thanks to our server for explaining how tired she was and what long hours she works and for staring at the machine as my husband paid. Will never be back and sad as this is in our hood."}
{"text":"I proooobably should've taken the bartender's advice on the burger.  Went here on a Saturday night around 8:30p with a big group (15 people) and were politely told that it could be a really long wait for such a large party. Unfortunately they don't do (at least that's what I was told by a friend) reservations on Saturday night - even for such a large party. Fortunately (or unfortunately for my girlfriend & I) the rest of the party had not shown up yet and since we decided to wait around til more people came by before contemplating on leaving, we were able to find seats at the bar for at least 10 people. The bar area started to empty out a smidge by about 9-915pm so it allowed our big group to sit as close to each other as possible.  Food-wise, the restaurant serves some very Jack Astors-esque dishes, from nachos and tacos to deep fried restaurant calamari and specialty burgers. Lots of drinks available and they have daily specials for those who want to kick back and relax a bit. The dish that I was most looking foward to was the Tuna Poke, which is something I've been looking to try at any restaurant to be frank, but I may have hyped myself up a bit too much.  Ordered myself a pint of Sapporo ($6), an order of Tuna Poke ($13) and a Local Burger with Yam Fries ($14.75 + a smidge extra for the fries, which I wasn't told was extra but should've expected it I guess) and finished off with an order of Churros ($6) and it's what I expected from a bar first, restaurant second type of joint.   Burger wasn't the greatest - I tasted more hot sauce than any other flavour that the burger was supposed to have. The patty itself was also on the dry side and much smaller than I had anticipated. The bartender recommended the Brooklyn burger and others in the group seemed to have enjoyed that one better. The yam fries, well they were yam fries... and the poke, was just essentially tuna sashimi with some garnish, avocado and other minced toppings... definitely not what I was expecting but again I feel like I hyped myself up too much. The churros made up for it I suppose since they were of decent size and fluffyness, while the chocolate hazelnut dipping sauce had marshmallows inside em!   Overall, not a bad take on a Bar/Restaurant joint. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here though."}
{"text":"OK, you get stars for cool comfy d√©cor and trend factor. The rooftop patio is great, the one downstairs with a lovely view of the parking lot and Laird Street, not so much. A few points for the hanging bike rack, because all things bike-related are A-OK in my book. Kudos also for the beer/wine specials and range of interesting choices in beers.  But you don't get more than three stars because you charge almost $15 for TWO small fish tacos (which taste great but are not worth $7 apiece) and $11 for pulled pork poutine which had neither enough cheese curds nor pulled pork to be called anything more than \"fries with some extra stuff\".  What happened to the small plates menu? It used to be $5 per single taco, you had that small pulled pork sandwich and some small salads. Perfect if you're having a drink and just want something small to munch on. Great for trying a variety of menu items. That was the best part of your menu, and now they're gone."}
{"text":"3.5/5 Good food, presentation needs improvement. Kitchen is fast, servers are slow with drinks and taking orders however are very friendly that was unexpected. Price is a little high but expected for the areas of town. Drinks are good and well priced.    Specifically I had the deluxe Burger and substituted sweet potato fries. The Burger was good and nice home made bun the smoked Brecon and cheese pairings were awesome. The Mayo however cave with a truffle oil in it and had to ask for just regular Mayo which they supplied no problem. Even with the  substitution I wasn't charged do that was nice.   Aphere is cool but there is too much going on at the bar, the dishwasher constantly running really smells and people are eating right beside the prep area for the bar which feels unsanitary.   Im not wow'd but I'm not repulsed either I will most likely return with friends on occasion but by far not going to be my \"local eatery\""}
{"text":"Seat yourself.   Literally. Go inside and just sit okay. There will always be someone there to help you.  This place becomes all types of crowds.  Families after a game, seniors, hipsters, young whipper snappers looking for drinks... everyone is welcome.   Their menu is that little folded square on the table. There's a variety of things to pick from but not many. Enough that you'll find something to eat but not be overwhelmed. You will be by the wine and drink options though.   I got the fish and chips. (The fish isn't real. It's bass. ) the chips were yummy. You even get salad. My sister ordered the chicken tacos. She liked them. The portions are huge which is very nice.   It's a good place to come after a long shopping session at the near by shoppes."}
{"text":"Came here for a few drinks. The cocktails were reasonably good, except when I decided to go off-menu and order a manhattan.  It came in a small glass, half-filled, with no ice, and no cherry. It tasted like floor cleaner. Unbelievably strong. The bartender clearly had no idea what the hell he was doing.  If I come back, I'll stick to the menu."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer.... great open space. The outside patio is cool too. Where it lacks is in substance - food and service. Menu is really small and it seems that you have to tell the servers more than once. I could understand if it's busy... Better service is at the bar as they are on it or at least close by. And what's the deal with the ketchup?"}
{"text":"Sat at bar twice. Fantastic knowledgeable service. Fresh beer on tap. Food pretty good too"}
{"text":"Went there for the second time this evening.  We went a few weeks ago and it was great! Thought we'd go back for date night. Mistake.   The restaurant and patio were packed. Lots of kids running around with no one keeping an eye on them. We were seated on the end of a long 6 seater table, and shorty after another couple sat at the other end. They weren't a problem.    The host who seated us took our drink order (glasses of wine), however the waitress who brought them didn't offer or bring us water the entire time we were there. We were planning on having an appetizer and dinner, but just couldn't stay. We had the fish tacos and the jerk chicken sandwich (on the sharing menu, although we weren't offered a knife to cut the single sandwich into 2 pieces). The food wasn't nearly as tasty as last time, there was half the meat in both dishes and the taste was bland on the tacos and very vinegary on the tacos.  We had thought the food would make up for the terrible service. The front of house staff was very rude. A booth opened up beside us and we asked our waitress if we could sit there instead,  and she didn't hesitate to move us over. Right as we got settled,  one of the inappropriately dressed girls from the front rudely came over and demanded that we move back as the table was reserved for people waiting.  No apologies were made by this employee, she seemed to want us to leave as soon as possible.  Once we moved back (embarrassingly) our disappointing meal arrived. We quickly asked for the bill as soon as we could flag down our waitress again.  The restaurant was very noisy, we had trouble hearing each other,  or the waitress. The other customers had no respect for others, the front of house staff seems useless for anything but cleaning tables and the food was below par. If Local cannot handle a busy night in the kitchen or waitstaff,  they should not let so many people in.  This is the only reason we signed up for yelp."}
{"text":"LOCAL on 8th is well... on 8th avenue SW, along Stephen ave.  It's like the prime neighbor meeting spot.  Upon entrance, you could be greeted but it's more of a make yourself at home kind of place.  I'd say Local is a casual but classy pub.  A big bar in the center, some booths and high top tables scattered and closer to the back there are some normal seats, half booth half chairs.  The menus are already on the table but I'd say don't even look at the menu and trust me on this.  FISH TACOS, yes... FISH TACOS - get them, probably order about 2-3 to start, maybe a side of yam fries but you must order the fish tacos. They're SO bomb, actually the best in the city - BEER (need I say more?) battered Baja, shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, some of their special sauce and lemon.  If you're feelin hot, squeeze some hot sauce on them, you really can't go wrong.  Super soft tortilla, crispy but juicy baja fish, unreal sauce, light crunch on the shredded cabbage and pico de gallo, the combination is heavenly like the close your eyes and remember this moment heavenly.  I can be pretty over the top sometimes but this is for real, my friends and I crave these tacos all the time and even for my past birthday, I requested that we go to Local in order to have the perfect birthday celebrations!  Okay okay, enough raving about the fish tacos (for now), I've had other food and the fries, burgers, sandwiches and salads are all wonderful, kind of typical pub food but with their own twist.  They even offer brunch on the weekends from 10AM to 3PM which I highly recommend.  It's like people don't know about the brunch menu or something.  The eggs benedict is great and the banana pancakes are yum!  They actually taste like crispy banana pancakes, fluffy banana goodness and the brunch prices are all under $20!  Now to the staff, they're amazing.  Every time I visit, they're always top notch - very attentive, always making some small talk, fun and super friendly.  I've never had a moment where I felt rushed even after I finish eating, I'm a chatterbox so friends and I stay for a little to chat and never once you get that feeling they want you out.  They say on their website \"who are we - ...kind of like your living room, just with better food and people to serve you beer\" it's true.  The vibe is great, as if you are among friends.  I highly HIGHLY recommend visiting Local, not just for their absolutely delicious, amazingly crisp, heavenly and tasty baja fish tacos but for the environment, vibe and good times.  Go visit, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Liberty Village I end up grabbing food at Local. It's a really nice big space, and they open up the huge garage-style windows when the weather's nice. However, don't be surprised if some pigeons make an appearance flying or walking around if that's the case. There's also a nice big patio with some lawn games (lawn bowling, if I remember correctly). The veggie burger is one of my favourites in the city, and the service is always good for the kind of place this is. It can get really busy and a little rowdy at peaks times or if there's a concert or soccer game going on nearby, so you might have to wait a bit to be seated."}
{"text":"It's okay  Walk by every day at lunch, have tried twice on weekends as its not so busy.  Staff is friendly enough, food and drinks are good.   Just expect more serving wise for my money."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here tonight (July '17). We're expecting our first wee one any moment now, and we couldn't have had one of our last patio dinners at a better place. The first time we dined here (2015) we dined in the downstairs dining area - inside. Tonight we were on the rooftop patio and it was just epic. Let's just say, I thought the dining room was really freaking cool and the rooftop patio is just way above. The seating area is slightly cramped but when you have fabulous food, awesome furniture/decor, friendly staff and food that is out of this world you will be blown away. The chips that came with the guacamole seems to be baked in house, and the guacamole is made fresh at the table side. My wife had fish tacos, and I had the deluxe burger. Both with regular fries and sweet potatoes fries respectively. It was so great."}
{"text":"The Baja Fish Taco's are off the chain! Fresh ingedients with lots of flavor, be prepared to order a few more!  The staff is friendly and sociable, I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't know who the chef is but this was absolutely fabulous food! The edamame was amazing, hippie sandwich to die for, good poke. Great people watching on Canada day. Also loved the Caesar Bloody Mary. Best meal of our trip."}
{"text":"Finally walked by on a day when the line up outside wasn't rediculus. Service is just the minimum. But the scenery is awesome. Great spot for people watching while muching on some good eats.  I'll be there again because I'm in the neighborhood but wouldn't make an detour if I didn't live nearby..."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness.  I've eaten here in the past, but I wasn't all that wowed, so it's been a while since I last visited. And I don't know if the chef, kitchen staff, or management changed, but I'm floored by how much this place has skyrocketed. Not the best place in Toronto, but miles beyond what it once was, and certainly a new favourite.  What has always stood out to me in the past is the Local's unique, warehouse-turned-restaurant and trendy-meets-rustic atmosphere. I've seen it tried a million times and a million ways, but this place has it down to a science. The comfy booths, shabby chic lighting displays and rooftop patio finished off with string lights combine perfectly, and it's just a nice place to be.  For appetizers we ordered the fried calamari to share, and it was great. I mean - fried calamari is generally great, but this particular dish was especially so. If done incorrectly it is easy for calamari to come off as bland and lacklustre, but this was quite the opposite. It was a well seasoned and perfectly spiced, not to mention the sauce. It was creamy with a hint of spice, and paired incredibly with the calamari as opposed to overpowering it. So, sufficed to say, an excellent start.  From there I ordered the Tuna Club Sandwich, while the person I was with ordered the chicken tacos. Oh boy.   When I took the first bite of the tuna club, I nearly dropped dead. I really didn't come in expecting much, but I was so, so wrong. The tuna was fresh, well cooked, and wonderful, the avocado was delicious, and the pickled onions provided the perfect dash of flavour. Further, the cheese was fried onto the bread, giving it slight grilled cheese undertones, and the hint of bacon was the perfect compliment to the meal. And every ingredient came together in perfect balance to create one mind-blowing dish.  In short? Order. It. Plus - what a spectacular contrast it was to Knuckle Sandwich.  As for the chicken tacos, they were just as amazing. The chicken was perfectly spiced, the vegetables were fresh and flavourful, and the sauce was beyond delicious. Honestly, I could have eaten that stuff with a spoon. Do note that they were quite creamy because of that (and thus rather heavy), but it worked. Oh my goodness did it work.  All of this comes together to create a vibrant upscale pub that will draw you in with it's decor, and keep you with it's to-die-for food. If you're looking for lunch, dinner, or even brunch (which they have a menu for), this is definitely worth a drop by."}
{"text":"We are in town from the US, and this is our last leg on our week long road trip. We found this place after walking down Stephen Avenue. The place is exactly what we were looking for, large beer selection on tap and bottles/cans! We only ordered apps and sharing plates, but everything was delicious. Service was absolutely perfect and we would definitely come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The food seems to have gone downhill recently, and the service is typically quite slow, even when they aren't busy. We tried to make reservations for a special event, and it seems like they have a very inconsistent policy for reservations where you have to go in and talk to them in person (as per their website). Went there, and was told that they never take reservations, despite a number of tables being held at that very moment. Not worth going to, there are better places with better service in the same area."}
{"text":"Great spot. Would be 5 stars with a bit of food refinement - Tuna Poke was cloyingly sweet, french fries were undercooked. Excellent fish tacos and crispy chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Awesome place for larger groups with good drinks and great selection of food.  Staff was friendly and quick.  Music is a bit loud but very enjoyable.  Food was excellent with great variety and great execution.  The kahuna burger is excellent as well as the fish tacos.  Finish off with the churros with chocolate sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome upbeat venue with a great crowd, music and food. If they invested in water glasses that would be great. People drinking from water jugs was entertaining."}
{"text":"Ok I'm not gonna lie, this place wasn't part of the original game plan.  We were headed to Mildred's temple kitchen for brunch until we were told it will be an hour wait. The left side of my brain is telling me to go to Bar Buca where there is always seats but the right brain or maybe it's the Chinese in me is telling me to staying in liberty village since I had already paid for parking.  The right brain won and we ended up at the Local public eatery.   Their brunch menu is small but the taste is certainly not.  I ordered the hippie toast with poached eggs which is simply avo on multigrain toast.  The hubby ordered huevos rancheros and he chose the better dish this round.  It was a very tasty marriage of American breakfast with Mexican fiesta! The different flavours of chillies/beans and textures of fried tortilla/avo/fries eggs just all blended so nicely in your mouth.   I love the atmosphere here, they played a lot of upbeat happy tunes from the 70's and 80's which I absolutely lovvvvve!"}
{"text":"I wish the churros were still available, but the service was amazing! Alycia is great and has the best recommendations. Couldn't have asked for a better server!"}
{"text":"Ok so the patio is awesome and it's a fun place to hang out. The food is great and a solid drinks menu too. But the service! Wow. It was actually comical. We arrived and sat at the bar to wait for our table which was fine. I joined our group late and sat right at the bar for at least 15 minutes before the bartenders made any sort of contact with me.   Eventually there were three tables on the patio just waiting to be cleared off, a line out the door, and zero people trying to clear tables and get more people seated. We waited and waited. Eventually my friend went and told the host to maybe get some staff to clear tables.   Then of course came the actual ordering of food and more drinks and same thing.. so slow. It's like they don't actually want to do business. If you like the people you're with, (which I did) it's totally okay but if you're in a rush or super hungry.. don't do it.   I'm sure I will go back but it would be nice if they stepped up the service end a bit."}
{"text":"What a fun spot!  Local has a good vibe, great food and the decor in the space is charming as all hell."}
{"text":"Had an awful experience at Local today. First, the drinks we ordered tasted disgusting I don't even know why they are on the menu to be honest. Our server was not attentive to us at all, didn't ask us once how everything was, and then at the end when we had our bills and were waiting for about 20 minutes to pay, after one of us paid she would leave for like 5-10 minutes, then come back and another one of us would use the machine and she would leave again, and finally one of my friends told her we were just kind of in a rush to get out so if we could just finish paying already, to which she replied \"yeah sorry the GM has a few friends here so I'm trying to make sure I'm giving them great service.\" Interesting, what about all the other paying customers? Won't be returning to Local."}
{"text":"Stopped here during a layover stop from the mountains. Service was quick and attentive and the brunch was amazing! Brunch meals come with a shot of fruit smoothie which was a fun surprise."}
{"text":"Went here on Victoria Day for a late lunch.  Decided to go upstairs for the patio. You can sit yourself at any table. Got the Brooklyn Burger and poutine. One of the best burger I had in the city! Love the interior and everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Standard pub fare, mainly men, large, loud, busy.  One vegetarian option, veggieburger - what a surprise! The barbecue sauce that came with the dish was delicious, there was a side salad with it that tasted like it was relatively fresh. We had a couple of pints and a Caesar, the waitresses seemed pretty efficient and we were in and out relatively quickly.  The dishes seemed like standard Calgarian menu items. A lot of red meat barbecue style home cooking style.   Because this Operation is a product of an already proven Conglomerate, I think it will do okay.   It lacks imagination, creativity, and anything really funky and new about the food items found on the menu.  Being a foodie from Vancouver means I am terribly spoiled. I pray for the day when this town can get some really interesting food on the go. Steak and ribs and chicken and burgers are just so boring."}
{"text":"best fish taco!!! portion is huge and the price is affordable. their drinks were also very good!"}
{"text":"Although we had to wait for just over an hour for a table (because we had a group of 6) the manager, front door staff and waitresses, more than made up for our wait times. This is a great bar without attitude, and the staff are outstanding here. 5 stars for the service, 5 stars for the selection of drinks and 5 stars for the food (try the Local Burger and the Fried Chicken Sandwich) If you are planning a night out in Liberty Village, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch as this place is new and we wanted to check it out.  We got the fried egg sandwich and veggie Benedict.  Both fantastic.  Please see my attached pictures.  The smashed potatoes are fried and then tossed in a beautiful garlic and green onion sautee.  The nicest surprise was the strawberry banana smoothie shot that arrived on the plate.  It was a perfect ending to the meal.  Our server was super nice and the manager came by and asked how our meals were.   All in all a good experience.  I would come back and check out dinner."}
{"text":"What can I say? I LOVE the LOCAL! Beautiful people, great drink specials, good food and friendly service. You really can't go wrong with such a combination.   This bar has become a staple for people who live or visit the Liberty VIllage area. Expect a min 15 min wait if you're waiting for a table on the patio (its worse if its a sunny day or if there is a TFC game on).   I visit every week and you really can't wrong with any of the food items. Some things I would personally recommend include the chicken burger, quesadillas, tacos and guacamole dip.  Order away!"}
{"text":"Considering this is more of a sports bar and I was looking for a vegetarian option, my culinary expectations were a bit low. With that in mind, I was pleasantly surprised to discover LOCAL does a very delicious veggie burger (one of the best I've had in Toronto). The patty is homemade and is topped with lots of yummy veggies (just look at that beautiful cross-section). Yum. The rest of the menu seemed to have a lot of typical sports bar items (i.e. fried food, meat/cheese-heavy meals, scant veggie/vegan/gluten-free options). Service on a Sunday afternoon was decent, though it would obviously be busier if a game was on. Good place to bring a group, as there were plenty of tables inside & out."}
{"text":"Absolutely disastrous service. I don't care if you're understaffed or your food is good but if your communication sucks, that's on you and your management.   We walked into the busy place and they have a sign that says \"Please seat yourself\". We walked to an empty table and a male server stopped us to tell us that a couple is going to sit there. Sure, then he tells us that there's a table being cleaned out that is meant for us so we waited. 10 minutes later, two other groups came in after us and we were all waiting, by that time, another table cleared up. Making us three groups and two available tables.   Then a different female server comes up and tells us to sit anywhere, the two groups that came after us ran to the tables and we were left with no table. Management had no idea, they weren't keeping tabs of people coming in so we had to wait longer because they weren't on top of this.  1. If you tell your diners to sit anywhere, then keep it neat and orderly. 2. Don't tell us to wait for a table and have a group who came after us, take our table.  Ridiculous. Not coming back."}
{"text":"A somewhat regular lunch place given I work nearby. Colleague and I ordered Fish and Chips, some what disappointed, way more batter than fish and very greasy. Not up to the usual standards from Local. Service is friendly and efficient"}
{"text":"Good beer, good appetizers, good burgers.  Was initially in line to go to a different restaurant but the line up was too long so we ended up here.  We were lucky to end up here.  This was more our scene.  They have a good list of different beers including local ones and the burgers are so so good.  Try the Brooklyn burger. The bun! Yum!  Fish tacos is a good size too."}
{"text":"I had their fish and chips. The fish was well fried with a light and crispy batter. Their coleslaw and fries wasn't great though but the portions were generous and the service was quick, friendly, and attentive. Great big patio with a shuffleboard too!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite places in Stephen Ave because the food is decent and they are great drink specials. I struggled between giving them three out four stars because the food can be a bit inconsistent. However, if you are going for bar snacks and a drink, it's at least a four star place in my book.   That being said, I do think this place is great for long lunches or after work drinks. I don't think is necessarily a dinner spot, because as I mentioned there is some inconsistency in the food. For instance, there seemed to be a period of time where the afternoon shift was over salting everything, especially the tacos, so I just stopped ordering those. I do really enjoy the burgers and the salads so I am fine with choosing that. Even with the oversalting I still kept going because I enjoy the rest of the menu, the service, and the drink specials.   The thing I like those most is the daily wine special. They have $4 mystery wine everyday (red and white) which is the cheapest I have seen wine on Stephen, if it's not Wednesday. Plus that special goes on all day, not just happy hour, which I appreciate. They also have daily beer specials but I am always so jazzed about the wine I forget what they are.   This place does get packed during lunch so go before 11:30 to ensure you will get a table. You might have to wait after that. However service is super quick so if you don't want to spend more than an hour at lunch then you definitely won't. I really do think you should try this place - I think the food is good and so reasonably priced that this is a step above many other places around."}
{"text":"Had this place hyped up to me by a friend, and I would say she was pretty spot-on with her assessment. The selection of food was fairly standard pub fare, but the quality was impressive.  FOOD:   I went with the \"Brooklyn Burger,\" which was topped with a beer-battered onion ring, red pepper relish, and aged cheddar, on a black sesame seed bun. Side of match stick fries. The patty was juicy enough to eventually soak through the bun - so if you're a slow eater, be prepared for a slightly soggy bun. This didn't detract from the taste too much for me though, as the toppings went really well together to add a bit of sweetness to the salty goodness. Fries where crispy, as I like them.  SERVICE:  A bit on the slow side, but this place gets uber packed on a Friday and Saturday night, so it's understandable. The server herself took time to answer questions, and did a good job sorting through our multiple bills and items ordered.  ATMOSPHERE:  My first thought was that this place has a bit of a 'Texas' vibe to it...not sure if intentional or not. Either way, it's a pretty spacious place with a nice patio and elevated seating area inside. Great to stop by for a meal, or drink on a summer day.  VERDICT:  If I'm in the area, I'll be back to try the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great staff... But I think they are screwing themselves with the lack of kid-friendliness in this neighbourhood. What works in Liberty Village (one of their other locations) doesn't work in Leaside where there is such a overload of families with kids. Kids are not welcome up on the patio, there is no kids menu, no colouring, etc etc. I would be fine with restrictions in the evenings, but during the day I think it's just downright offensive. When we were there we watched 5-6 families come and go when they realIzed they couldn't use the patio etc. leaving the place pretty much empty."}
{"text":"Had brunch their today, and the salsa Verde sauce tasted like it came out of a bottle pulled from the refrigerator. Right now, my stomach is not feeling good."}
{"text":"We were a party of 5 and we were seated pretty quickly. This place wasn't extremely packed so Im not so sure why the waiters seemed to be so upset. They took forever to bring us menus and even longer to bring us water and take put orders. Out food came out within a timely manner. 3 of my friends had a smoothy shot with there meals. When I asked for one I was rudely told that it only came with breakfast l, which to me wasn't true as my friend clearly had a burger as well. The staff literally seemed to not have wanted to be at work.   Thankfully the food was good but I would never re visit this place"}
{"text":"This place is a dark temple of human denial and swindleship.   Let me preface by saying that staff were very friendly, and populous and fast. No complaints whatsoever.   The issue with Local is that it's a corporate nightmare trying to pretend to be a wine bar pretending to be hooters so that all the confused people who are lost in a non-place will think that 'actually Liberty village has some pretty fun cool spots'!   And frankly I don't care what you want to be but so help me god if I am ever again faced with the audacity of being charged $1 extra to have celery on a tiny plate of $8 chicken wings I will take everyone's Herschel bags and throw them in the lake."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for steak and eggs!  Although the place is loud, service is friendly and people are cheery. Food is just right and the steak was tender. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Great ambience and very good appetizers.. The guacamole was really good and the wine is not bad!! Great place to go with friends and have fun!"}
{"text":"After a busy weekend from performing! Time to relax and grab some beer/cider.   The place was suggested by a local friend and surprisingly a good place to just relax, talk, and enjoy the company of friends.  Our server was good and suggested some beers to try. I ended up getting the hard cider.   Service is fast and our server was very attentive."}
{"text":"Came for brunch and was debating between the Brooklyn Burger and the Eggs Benedict. My friend was also in the same dilemma so we ended up sharing both plates. The restaurant was really great about it and split the items and plated it individually for us (see photo). We even each got our own bucket of fries and our own smoothie shot. Granted, it was earlier in the morning and it wasn't too busy yet.   The food itself was amazing!! The Eggs Benedict came with these garlic-fried potatoes and by far the best kind I've ever had for a breakfast item. The Eggs Benedict itself was cooked to perfection with the runny egg. Would definitely order again!  The Brooklyn Burger was super juicy and the red pepper relish just completed the burger. Not to repeat myself, but I'd order this again too. The burger comes with some nicely salted fries - very comparable with McDonalds fries in terms of taste and thickness. This is definitely a compliment because McD serves the best fries in my mind."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was packed.  What I didn't expect was this to be a bar essentially, and for a bar to be so full so early on a weekend, it was around 12ish on a Saturday, food must be great right?  This meal however started out not so great though.  There was no one to seat us, or to even ask for our name and the number of people in our party.  I'm pretty sure we had to wait like 10 minutes for the hostess to finally come by, but it felt like forever.  We got a seat soon after, at the bar.  When they asked what we wanted to drink and we said water, we got a look that was like, why are you sitting at the bar?  While I was deciding what to order, I scanned the room to see what other people were eating, mostly burgers.  I wasn't feeling like a burger, so ended up ordering a west coast chopped salad with chicken while the hubby ordered a burger.  My salad arrived and I wondered, wheres the rest of it?  The portion was pretty small.  The description said that there's supposed to be beets, I couldn't find any, and was about to ask our server when I finally found ONE tiny cube of a beet.  At least the greens were fresh.  The hubby's burger was much better.  Quite juicy.  The downside of juicy means soggy bun.  They make their own burger buns it seemed, but the bun was too light to hold up to the juices and the toppings.  It was a mess to eat.  I have friends that prefer this super soft burger bun, but I hate it.  Take a pass on Local Public Eatery, unless you're there to drink.  They do have a huge selection of beers and daily drink specials that they list on their train station flip board.  The board itself is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Very good Fish tacos. Very trendy venue with good service which made my first visit enjoyable. The hot wings were nothing special and the pork appetizer was just ok. The tacos and service are 4 stars, the rest of the food was 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good spot to be at for a sports game! Really good, positive energy from both staff and patrons. Can't wait to spend summer nights here :)."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for a concert, we parked at the Budweiser stage parking and walked here. It was a Sunday afternoon and this place was hoppin. We walked in and thought there would be a wait, they just didn't have any seating outside but we got sat right away inside. Our waitress came right over and brought us water and gave us a few minutes to decide on drinks. I ordered a mimosa and my friend got the beer on special. We ordered the chips and salsa for an appetizer which were pretty good. The salsa had a good flavor. We both also ordered the local burger, which as far as burgers go it was one of the best I've had in a while! The service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was pretty awesome. I would happily visit this place again."}
{"text":"This place is extremely noisy. I ordered the chicken salad which came with a very small piece of chicken which was completely over priced. When the bill came my boyfriend gave an extra $20 so that he could get change for the tip. After we left he realized the waitress had only given change for $10 so she took an extra $10 on top of the tip he left her. We thought this could possibly have been by accident. He sent an email to management saying he realizes she could have just made a mistake. Absolutely no response back on their behalf. Any decent restaurant should have proper customer service to respond back to a customer. I would never go into a restaurant that does not care about customer service. Plus very limited menu and overpriced."}
{"text":"Good space. Good energy. We had fish tacos, local beer to start. Then in house burgers for the mains for lunch. Food was top level for a busy spot like this. Service was friendly but random. Will return."}
{"text":"LOCAL Public Eatery was highly recommended by a friend Pauline W so we decided to come by for a night cap.  Parking on the weekend though might be an issue as the lot has limited parking spaces. I have to fight for the last one with my friend. Aside for that I had a good experience.  Local beer on taps though limited but I like how they are on a rotation so I can look forward to something seasonal and different next visit. And if you prefer wine, they have wines on taps too. The bartender here is high energy and friendly. Ready to give you some recommendations or a sample before you placed your drink order.   For the sport fans, there are quite a few TVs in the bar/dining area so you won't be missing any actions. And they even have a rooftop patio area for the warm summer days.  $5.50 for a pint is quite reasonable priced for a craft beer.   I cannot comment on the food as that would be another review if my friend would invite me to join her again for a bite at LOCAL."}
{"text":"Did our co-worker's baby shower here. Finally had the much raved about fish tacos. And damn those are good! So yeah, baby shower, a ton of people. Had gifts and we brought cake which they kindly set aside for us. One of my coworkers caught the girl serving us roll her eyes when we had asked for the cake box back. Lol I get it. Sorry for holding up your table. Still 4 stars for the great atmosphere and awesome food. Cant wait for the summer time. The patio is going to be awesome."}
{"text":"Drinking only (since our server forgot to put in our order)   Get the Caesar. It's Canada version of a Bloody Mary, it really just taste the same. Supposedly they use Clamato, but many bars in the US uses Clamato juice too. So not sure, just another name. But it tasted good and we enjoyed it. Love the garnish on it, especially the beef jerky!   We ordered the poutine but the server never put it in... so we were severely disappointed. Service obviously lacking. I'm sure it tasted good."}
{"text":"For what it is, I liked Local as a pub with the usual pub like menu. Deco was cool with many TVs for the sports lovers. There's also a nice bar.  There's an upstairs eating area but it's restricted to those 19 years old.   No reservations allowed so can be busy at times.   The classic burger is usually what I order there. Good juicy burger and the fries are good.  Beer selection is also good.   Anyway a good choice for those seeking a pub environment."}
{"text":"This has become my regular brunch spot. I love the freshness of food, the great service, great selection of drinks and a short wait to be seated (we have been lucky during busy brunch times to be seated quickly) make me come back every Sunday. Thank you to chefs for the delicious food and to all staff: thank you for friendly service!"}
{"text":"Food and drink: The Local gets 5 stars for their beer - they've got a good selection of craft beer to suit any taste profile. The food is decent but nothing to rave about, more an accompaniment to good drinks  Atmosphere: Trendy, especially compared to what I was expecting for the location. Also love that they've got a shuffleboard table (though they need to get new discs, most of them are broken)"}
{"text":"Came here cus it was a place I've never been before so me and my friends checked it out.   We were gna sit in the patio until we were told that there was a rooftop patio tap we went up and sat at the bar.  Our bartender was the bomb. He treated us really well. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, guac and chips, calamari, and perogies.   All were delish and they make the guac right in front of u. Price is good and good portions. One of my new fave places."}
{"text":"Server is pretty nice. Came here for Happy Hour. Sooooo loved the tacos. I got chicken and fish tacos for 2.24 each and their wine special on Wednesday. Server is very friendly. Been here twice and ambiance are same. Packed with people. My coworker just didn't like their orange juice + vodka. It tasted wrong, but overall it's fun and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Caesars , hippie toast and tacos are a must here!! A lot of business casual people here in regards to the location it's not surprising. They play really good music which makes for good vibes around the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went to Local Public Eatery on a Saturday night. I was expecting there would be a wait, but luckily there seemed to be a few tables open. I went up to the hostess desk which is perched up above the rest of the restaurant. I asked for a table for 4 and she said that it was not a problem and turned away and stood at the top of the stairs. Confused, I asked if I just seat myself or what? As she played with her hair she turned around from leaning on the railing and said she was just waiting for tables to get cleaned. Then went back to chatting with another girl, playing with her hair and looking over the restaurant.   We stood there for longer than I expected, but I get it, tables do need to get a wipe. Still she just stood there, and then after a bit decided to walk down into the restaurant. When she came back to address us she pointed out into the restaurant and told us that we could sit \"over there\". I had to ask 2 more times which table we were sitting at because she refused to walk us to the table. Once sitting, I noticed that she put together a table for 2. Yet, we were 4. Good job, Hostess.   At this point I was pretty irritable and was ready to leave. Then our server walked over and it was as if sunshine and rainbows came out as she walked over. She immediately moved us to a more suitable table, wiped it down, got our drink orders, and cracked a few jokes. Unfortunately, because we had to move we got a new server who wasn't as enthusiastic and cheerful, but still pleasant. Anything was better than the Hostess.  The drinks were fantastic, the vibe was fun and laid back, and the food was good. I'll try Local Public Eatery again, but hopefully they can step up on their costumer service game when it comes to the Hostess. Also, get more Pork Belly, I was sad it had run out and I was unable to try it."}
{"text":"Loved the tasty pub fare and warehouse ambiance, service not so much. The first half of the meal was perfect - we got seated in a big booth, our orders were taken and filled quickly. I loved the fish and chips ($1 extra for the yam fries with a side of truffle oil aioli, a must), and my friends enjoyed their burger and salad. But once we got our entrees, we never saw our server again. Apparently there was some miscommunication during a shift change. We literally could have walked out, and no one would have noticed. By the time we got a server, we decided against another round of drinks, paid, and left. Service put a damper on an otherwise positive experience. I'd go back, but I'd adjust my expectations."}
{"text":"Popped by after getting lost and I'm sure glad we did! LPE has a really friendly and social atmosphere with a great throwback playlist playing MJ, footloose, mama Mia and more! Their menu is quite small on variety but they do every dish really well. The fried chicken on the burgers were nice and crispy and the ahi tuna salad had amazing flavour. I definitely recommend that you substitute regular fries for the yam fries. Overall perfect place to catch up with friends over some drinks and good food."}
{"text":"Had beers and nachos with a colleague. The nachos ($18) were described as loaded, but was pretty disappointing: very little pulled chicken, beans, a bit of avocado, no onion (but a bit of green onion), no tomato our any salsa, nor any sour cream.  The melted cheese covered just over a quarter side of the plate. I asked about salsa and our server said it's in there, but I'm unsure what she was referring to. She joked that we should quit complaining, which was kinda strange. Beers were tasty tho and hit the spot."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Good food. Beer pours are unsatisfactory with all the beers with all my friend. After a discussion with a manager seeking an explanation, he says that's how they do it and we can go elsewhere if we didn't like.  True statement but a little top off on my beer would have solved the issue. Maybe time to take business elsewhere for a little time."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've had in Toronto. Don't get me wrong - the people that go here are total assholes, and the staff are pretty damn good at dealing with their bourgeois shit. If you wanna be a fucking genius like me, order the veggie eggs Benedict, with a side of back bacon and watch yourself transcend from being a fat nobody into a goddamn King. Rule all of the peasants with your perfect breakfast order. Eat. Scream confidently. Repeat."}
{"text":"Nice outdoors patio and music and visually appealing food. I ordered the steak and eggs from the brunch menu. The steak had garlic paste on it. While it was delicious, the garlic overpowered the steak. The baked potatoes were perfect!  My one issue was the wait time to be acknowledged by the servers (at least 20 minutes!!), and the time it took to get the food as well. Total of 50-55 minutes from the time we sat down until the time we got the food. It was a busy Sunday noon, but the wait staff was also disorganized.  I will still consider visiting again, and possibly change my review if service was improved."}
{"text":"Local is in the heart of Leaside and a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.  We do not have great restaurant options in this area and Local never disappoints.  They offer standard pub fare with great flavour, quality and portion in a beautiful historic building that was extensively renovated with a rooftop patio.  The service is usually good unless they are slammed busy which happens often.  Prices are reasonable compared to other options.  They have an extensive bar menu with a rotation tap beer selection.  They offer many options from Ontario microbreweries and ask for a sample if you are unsure before committing to your selection.  I am a regular here and after a year I wish they would change up the menu a bit."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, big tasty Cesar's and lots of tv's for your sports viewing pleasure :)"}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, horrible service...  ...couldn't get our bill.  At all. Almost walked out on it."}
{"text":"Food was very good but the service was atrocious!  I would recommend Local for the food but not the service.  First the food: the veggie burger was very good.  Tons of veggies and sprouts.  Very good.  The deluxe burger was excellent- very juicy- cooked perfectly.    The fish and chips were excellent.  The fish was crispy and good ratio of fish to batter.  The service was abysmal.  What a disappointment!  We waited 15 minutes for our server to come over to take at least the drink order.  My beer was sitting at the bar for 15 minutes before they brought it over.  I had to wipe down our table.  We ordered waters with our drinks as well and they never came.  We asked for refills and another server had to eventually bring them as we were leaving.  The only time our server paid attention to us was when she was waiting to see if we were going to rip her on the handheld.  Food= good.  Service= BAD!"}
{"text":"I don't spend too much time in Liberty Village. It seems like a movie set for Toronto than an actual part of the city, and all of the bars and restaurants seem to be part of a chain gang. Though I, like many of you, have a handful of friends who are proud owners of Liberty Village condos now, so I make the trek from time to time.   Local is owned by the same people who own Joey (the fancy mall restaurants), but you know what, it's still a really fun bar. It's always packed and apparently has a mean brunch. I'm 29 childless and white, so naturally I shall return for said brunch.   I came in for drinks, drinks and more drinks and some fall bocce on the patio. We had a blast. I won.* Around the end of the night I also had the poutine, wings and nachos and I say go for the poutine. It was the superior dish... but isn't it always the superior dish?   *I didn't even come close to winning."}
{"text":"Amazing service from Clair R!!! The LOCAL Burgers were awesome as always! Normally I can't stand jalape√±os but their pickled jalape√±os are the bomb!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Sunday with some friends.  I love the setting.  The food is also quite good but unfortunately, all of that loses its charm against the poor service we received.  The place was nowhere near full and our server was not the only one on the floor, so I have no idea what the issue was.   Our water was never replenished, our dishes were never cleared (we had to clear them on our own onto an adjacent table) and we could never find out server when we needed one.   Service was so slow that one member of our party, although keen to order a beer, lost his desire for it in between having a sample and finding the server to place the order."}
{"text":"Pretty standard pub fare, beer selection is above average the servers are great. It's a little loud for anything romantic but for a get-together With Friends this place is above average. The fish tacos are fantastic, and for someone who doesn't like mayonnaise and so typically avoids fish tacos this place was a win."}
{"text":"We went to meet a group of friends there after the game who were there already and had a table. 3 of us got there and the ladies at front door wouldn't let us in as they said no seats. We told them our friends were inside, our friends came from inside outside to show them the table and the seats waiting for us and she still would t let us in and said we had to wait in line. That was horrendous and horrible service so we had to wait in line with a bunch of others even though seats were waiting for us inside. We tried two other attempts and she said no. On third attempt there was another person at door and asked her and she let us in but said I'd any of us were not sitting at our seat we would be thrown out. WTF! It's a bar and we can't walk around!??  We went in even though I didn't want to give any of my $$ to this place. On upside the waitress was amazing and friendly. Fish tacos were to die for and we played shuffle board (didn't get kicked out for leaving our seat) which was so much fun.  They need new hostess staff as represent the brand in a horrible way.  Wouldn't go back as don't want to be treated like that ever again. The only pull to go back would be the atmosphere and shuffleboard"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great staff,  great ambiance. Upstairs in the sun is a perfect lunch spot. Favorite is the fish tacos but get the fish grilled not deep fried."}
{"text":"Excellent eggs Benny :) really good sauce and the fries were nice crispy. It also had a shot of yogurt which was cute."}
{"text":"Food *** Service ** Ambiance ***  A casual bar with TVs that play live sports and a good patio in the summer.    Been here a bunch of times and tried a good portion of the menu.   The food is decent but nothing to write home about.   I normally stick to a burger when I go.    Service is hit and miss. Sometimes it seems like you need to beg to pay your bill or order another drink."}
