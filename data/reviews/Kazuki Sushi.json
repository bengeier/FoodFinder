{"text":"Attempted to enjoy this restaurant twice when it was Extreme Sushi and was disappointed both times. With the change in ownership and name I thought it was time to try again. I had high hopes, but again they were not met. The service was ok, but nothing exceptional. The selection on the menu was good, but the actual food was disappointing. The rolls were creative, but piece size and ingredient distribution were inconsistent. The Sushi pieces were small and the rice didn't hold together. Maybe I set my expectations too high, but I expect perfection when it comes to sushi and only one place has met that expectation... Kobe Sushi on the 215 and Rainbow."}
{"text":"They can change the name every week - but, until the ownership/management completely changes, the fact remains:  this is the worst sushi restaurant ever!! The most frustrating part is - we only live about a mile away.  We love sushi - and, if it were even half decent ... we would probably eat there at least once/twice a week.  But, we opt to drive to Henderson instead. Not only are their rolls small and overpriced... the rice is undercooked and the fish is sub-par.  It's a very small restaurant with supremely poor ventilation.  When they make their baked entrees - it overwhelms the place with a God awful/unbearable smell that completely overpowers the flavors of anything you may be eating.  And, don't even bother with the \"all you can eat\".  The service is so bad - you won't be able to get your money's worth anyway (Oh... and they limit you to one hour). Can't say enough negative things about this place.  If you're in Southern Highlands and really craving sushi... get it at Smith's instead.  It's 1000 times better."}
{"text":"Place is under new management and boy is this new owner about saving every dollar she can. Even the atmosphere has changed - the happy chefs I used to know now look miserable.  When asked why the changes in the menu, at least she was honest about saving money however when I responded with the changes probably cost her a customer and this might be my last visit she told me and my buddy who were in uniform to get out.  Beware of this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent AYCE!!! Will be my new go to place. Have to try the deep fried oreos!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Everything seemed fresh and tasted good. I like the bento boxes and the chicken and beef were the best I tasted so far.  I only eat the cooked fish in rolls but they were very good too."}
{"text":"Solid Sushi place close to where I live .... They offer AYCE and regular menu items lots to choose from ... Food quality was good I liked the coconut shrimp and the dynamite roll was good also ... Service was quick and attentive and the decor was very nice and cozy ... Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Burn your a$$ roll was amazing, super spicy. But loved the jalapeño on top! I also loved the size of the restaurant. If you went alone to just grab something and have a beer or saki the bar area is nice and inviting. I loved the food and will definitely be back. The owner was also there and was really funny, the sushi master was also really fast with the food."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill since the new owner took over. She even has her own employees writing comments on Yelp for her. The review written by Michael  W is her employee. Check out the picture on his review you ll see him working in there when you go in. Thats pretty pathetic ..."}
{"text":"When they open the food was over expectation, overprice but good quality lately they really went down to quality don't go and eat there"}
{"text":"Awesome food , I had never heard of a bento box basically it is a combo meal, I always get the chicken teriyaki with a philly roll, I know I'm simple, but I like the place it is very convenient, there might be better places out there but I really like this one."}
{"text":"Took my family here for Mother's Day and the restaurant was completely empty.  We were the only 5 people in the whole restaurant... an experience we will never forget... the dish settings before the meal were dirty and greasy.  I requested clean dishes.  The new ones came back even greasier.  My husband insisted we all get up and leave.  Although disgusted, was too embarrassed to just get up and leave so I decided to give it a chance, but only to regret it later...  Hair in my daughter's Miso Soup Soggy oil drenched Tempura (not crispy) Overcooked, loose pasty rice sushi Burnt to a crisp calamari Burnt tempura vegetables (mixed and sweet potato) A few items we ordered never came... THEY ERASED THE CHECKED BOXES.   At this point, all I wanted was simple Tofu and steamed rice... the waiter replied, \"If it's not on the menu, you can't have it!\"... Yet, they  have the tofu, they have the steamed rice and they have Teriyaki Sauce.  \"NEVER AGAIN!!!\" I will stick to the amazing SEN SUSHI where I was never disappointed and which is just a couple of blocks away 2338 Major Mackenzie Dr W #3, Vaughan, ON L6A 0C4  (905) 553-0046"}
{"text":"Best Sushi I have had in Vegas. Fast, high quality fish and great staff. Give it a shot, it's more than worth it."}
{"text":"Mmmhmmm...  This is my favorite quick spot for a sushi roll and I only spend 20$ at the most on myself they have amazing prices,  and the service is always fast and friendly.  Its kinda small inside but it makes for an at home feeling.  Spicy tuna roll with a side if there super spicy sauce is sooo good. The burn your ass roll is another favorite.  If you like spicy try it. Yummmmm sushi.."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good. Friendly, fast, and fresh. The service is as good as the food. We were greeted by the new owner as soon as we walked through the door. She was very friendly and took us  through the menu. The rolls were very good, not one miss. The only disappointment was that I didn't take more photos."}
{"text":"This is not the place to go for a nice sushi experience, I was charged for two salmon rolls and received one, my receipt clearly showed two salmon rolls but the lady owner kept telling me no you only paid for one. After showing her that one salmon roll is not $26.00 dollars she proceeded to tell me I was wrong. We paid and were  leaving when   my family witnessed the lady owner literally yell at a takeout guest in front of the small store, then proceeded to follow him out of the store  yelling. All of the guests in the small store heard the yells at this point, when the owner walked in she said \" I'm sorry I do not like this guy\"   Yes it was crazy!! Several family's walked out, the whole experience was a mess.  There are two good severs that work there who are polite but I would not recommend going to this place, there is one across the street on southern highlands which we will be going to from now on."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my husband, first time at Kazuki sushi... Had all you can eat. Food was ok , I had better for the price. Service was slow like they don't want you to eat too much. So order everything you want at once otherwise you will be waiting awhile  in between orders or have more beer and you won't realize your still waiting. Gave it a try and won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place was great. As someone who has worked in a sushi place before (waitress), I recommend this place. Good portions and the owner is so friendly. Great sauces and fish! Very yummy tempura :)  *regarding some of the negative reviews posted below - if you are going to an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, eat respectfully. Etiquette is key! I can just imagine what's going on in some of these reviews so let me clue you in on a couple of things. This is coming from a former sushi restaurant waitress.  - Don't sit there for hours and hours, ordering more and more food because the sushi chefs, cooks, and waiters will not appreciate it. It is not an explicit rule, but all-you-can-eat-does NOT mean you can sit there for lunch and practically wait til dinner to eat more (and all on the same bill). Very inconsiderate!  - Good sushi does not come in huge mounds or large portions. Kazuki is good about this. Customers tend to care too much about getting the best deal in quantity, when really sushi is about quality. If you want something huge that you cannot fit in your mouth (giggity) that is of lower quality, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE, good service, variety of sushi and appetizers, and pleasant decor. Seaweed salad was ok, but the sashimi, sushi, rolls, beef, and fried wontons were super yummy. Horseradish not so good. Portions are on the small size but that's not a big deal considering it's AYCE--just order more. An additional bonus, bathrooms are nice and clean :) I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Such a great sushi buffet, very reasonably priced and a nice staff. Good quality and creative rolls. Plus they don't make you feel like fatties when you order your umpteenth roll on the all-you-can-eat ;-)"}
{"text":"I love there avacado rolls & the cucumber rolls as well! Great customer service and very attentive to making sure we were taken care of"}
{"text":"Loved it! Very surprised it was as good as it was with the let down of xtreme. Was very pleased with quality of food and atmosphere.  Will be returning soon"}
{"text":"First time we went with a Groupon before they were AYCE. Best sushi ever...more like suhi art! Family run place, fresh ingredients. Our dinner eneded up at  $100 incll. drinks for 2 adults and 1 child and it was worth every penny. We planned to go back, but unfortunately, on our 2nd visit they had gone AYCE and quality went down considerably. Did not go back after that."}
{"text":"Local gem. Just found by accident. So glad we did. We are from the OC and this place rivals some the best. Great service, fresh fish, creative special rolls."}
{"text":"WORST SUSHI IN VEGAS!!! I'm not being snobby because I'm just a normal blue collar guy but I love sushi and I know sushi. Seems  like no-one in this area does because this is a sad sad excuse for sushi to the point it angers me I think this it's the first bad review I've ever given. It actually smelled fishy in the car SUSHI SHOULD NOT SMELL LIKE FISH visually unappealing rolls are usually visually enticing and somewhat ornate like the chef cares about what he's doing. Between the smell and the way it looks honestly I didn't even eat it. Oh and a side note their website said the two special roll special was $20 so I'm not sure how that turned into $24 and $27 after tax which just seems wrong especially for this I don't know what that came in a foam bar style to go container. If you want some good sushi just go to oyshi or China town or at least just go to the smiths grocery next to this place I've seen their stuff and I'm sure it's better. I honestly feel bad for anyone who thinks this is good because you are really missing out."}
{"text":"I wasn't really greeted at the door by a server so I was kind of confused as to whether or not I should seat myself. eventually one of the sushi chefs invited me to sit at the bar and that he could help me.   I started off with a Lisa Lisa which was excellent. I've been here a couple times and I always order that one and usually leave. I decided to try a Baked Lasagna roll and it was kind of average. The wait was a bit long but one of the chefs kindly kept me posted on how long it would take. I was in no rush though, and working in the service industry myself, I know some menu items do take a bit longer so I wasn't too upset about it.   I only docked two stars because of the average taste of the Lasagna roll and the service at the beginning of my stay."}
{"text":"Figured I would try this place as I support all the other businesses in this shopping center.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else. Started out great, then I got my roll. Took one bite and knew something wasn't right. I looked at the salmon and realized it was farm raised vs fresh. Ugh.  I picked all the salmon out of my roll and continued eating it. Wasn't great. No one ever asked how it was. Everyone saw I picked out the salmon yet no one offered another roll, or even \"is everything ok\" (is know everyone saw bc I'm the only one in here right now)  When the server came to clear my plate I said you use farm.raised salmon? He smiled and said yeah. I said I wish I knew that before.... he took my plate and left the check.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. First Time was excellent and second time not a chance! Rude chef! Didn't get a chance to eat because they were rude! Won't be back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been here twice in the past two weeks and had great experiences both times. We each got bento boxes with teriyaki chicken and rolls. We both loved our food and you can't beat $8.95 for all the food you get. We recently moved to Southern Highlands so we'll be coming back a lot!"}
{"text":"Had the all you can eat under the new management and I must say the service was great and fish tasted fresh.  I'll be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to many been to many sushi restaurants since moving toToronto but  Kazuki is worth commenting on. They have all you can eat and a regular menu. The all you can eat menu has a large variety of  item to choose from and the food was overall  good quality (but can't really compare to Vancouver, sorry).  Small restaurant with good customer service.  I'd go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Clean,modern,friendly staff tvs with sports channles on, and bar. Has all you can eat available. Chicken terriyake for kids or if you dont eat sushi. I live in Southern Highlands we love coming here. Ikko one of.the friendliest down to earth servers that works there. Sushi great. Always on my appetite. Yum!! Its definitely a go :)"}
{"text":"i couldnt leave no stars. Servers here are crooks. they will change your tip amount. keep your receipt. mangers response is to give you a gift card. Dont eat here unless you want to pay twice as much."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, not love because the quality was never extraordinary, but ever since the place was bought by the older lady, it has progressively gone down hill. Some things are inedible and bordering on rotting. She is also cheap and has destroyed the friendly, almost festive, atmosphere the establishment once had. She is purposely slow so you do not get an opportunity to order when choosing all you can eat. A few dishes in and you can hear her make rude remarks about \"oh that table again?\" I am a size 0, 120 lbs, I do not eat a lot by any means. And as if rushing us is not enough, she will make excuses about things that are more expensive on the menu not being available. Even her staff can't stand her.  My advice: do your business a favor and stop being cheap, hire servers, deliver on the menu, and order seafood more frequently. We live in Las Vegas, and no one wants parasites.  For a place 200x better and close enough to SH check out SOHO on Jones."}
{"text":"Its a bit pricey but I guess that's expected being that the location is in Southern Highlands. I tried their salmon bento box. I was expecting a lower quality salmon but it was surprisingly good. The salmon was very soft. It also cane with tempura vegetables and a basic roll. I got the California roll and their spicy tuna roll. They were both very good. I've tried their AYCE menu a couple times and I have no complaints with either occasion. There's nothing really that special though that makes it stick out from the other AYCE sushi restaurants. I will go to this place again if I'm craving for AYCE sushi that is close by. Either this one or Oyshi on rainbow."}
{"text":"Very very good sushi. Great sushi chefs and a really good time. The all u can eat is a great price and the service is great too. Never had a single issue with this place. Always fun and a pleasure to eat here."}
{"text":"My family and I usually go to a different ayce sushi place, but it was late and we didn't want to make the drive.  There were no open table so we sat at the sushi bar and the chef didn't even acknowledge us or any wait staff. Took us 15 minutes to get greeted and get our drinks. Another 5 minutes pass and we Oder our sushi and move to a table that opened up. We finally start getting our sushi after being there a total of 30 minutes. Sushi was mediocre. California roll kind of tasted like the prepackaged sushi you see at smiths. Sushi was messy and was all just thrown on the plate, no pride in the food.  Wait staff was hardly even there so the host kept getting us drinks.  I will not be going again. I'll make the drive to oyshi."}
{"text":"First time in, looks like the place gets busy.   Nigiri rice and raw toppings dry, lots of rice, with thin cuts. The rolls same thing but from the other chef who seem to play up to other bar favorites; rolls not looking as good as other rolls, toppings were thin, dry and not an appealing presentation. The reason for the 2, is poor quality, lack of interaction, then favoritism. Very doubtful I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Good local sushi spot. Enjoy the atmosphere and options between AYCE Sushi and Bento box combos. Tuna Poke and other fish is very fresh. Enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"Great for all you can eat sushi, great selection of non sushi items for those in your party that don't eat sushi. My kids love the steamed rice and udon chicken bowls."}
{"text":"Came here when it was xtreme sushi and when it was bought out by someone else.  This new owner (3rd time being bought out) is really nice and she entertained us after our meal. She was making us laugh and made our service enjoyable.  The sushi is good, but I can't say it's the absolute best I've ever had.  The calamari is sooo small and you only get 4 little round prices of it.   But we enjoyed our time here overall.   The green tea ice cream with tempura Oreo is delicious."}
{"text":"Located on Jane street across from Canada's wonderland. It's a decent boutique style family owned sushi restaurant with an urban trendy atmosphere. The waitresses are really polite and the food I would say is slightly over priced. With an eruption of AYCE opening up, this places decided to make a drastic move. It recently started offering AYCE last month for lunch and dinner to help them compete in this market and area. Overall the food is decent,but not the best I've tried in Vaughan. I probably won't be going back there, since masa sushi opened up not too far from there."}
{"text":"Fun space - intimate, cute.  Good food and service.  I'll be back for lunch next time.  The owner and staff are a fun after hours crowd, too. They're open late."}
{"text":"3rd time here and it was just as delicious as the first time ! Love that they have all you can eat (that's a deal breaker for my bf when eating sushi) service was great the manager and sushi chefs are all so nice ! Perfect neighborhood sushi spot :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Now that they are under new management and have a new menu,  I'm excited.  I tried the Yoshi roll, which is my ultimate favorite, and I tried the Burn Your A$$ roll and that was also very good. I wish the rolls came out a little quicker but all in all I love the rolls here and the staff. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to try something delicious n different."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled as there are some really great sushi restaurants in Las Vegas but I thought the sushi was pretty average.  The rolls were all pretty much the same and not really unique. I will say that the deep fried oreo was pretty amazing and a must try. I am not an oreo fan but this is so much more than a regular oreo."}
{"text":"Good sushi spot overall.  Excellent miso soup and included in the ayce is some sashimi which is rare for ayce sushi spots.  The menu is small and simple but they do it well.  Nothing was really lacking for taste but it did not exactly wow me. I would say its worth a try but I dont know if I will be going back."}
{"text":"Under new ownership since extreme went under Not the same. The rice isn't nearly sticky enough Mussels are fantastic. Place is cozy. For the price... There's better and worse."}
{"text":"I came here a lot when it was Xtreme, and came back once after it had the name change.  Nothing much has changed, which is a good thing in this case.  The Yoshi's Dynamite Roll, my favorite, still remains.  I would come back over and over just for that one roll.  The mussels are also a must have, as they are very yummy and spicy.  The hostess is as cute as a button and very nice and helpful.  Service is also good at the bar, I'm not sure about at the tables as I rarely sit there.  The quality of the sushi is one of the best, and it's close to my house making it optimal eats!  If you are in the area, it's a good bet if you are looking for good sushi pretty fast!"}
{"text":"We've been there a few times, the food is good but the service really needs improvement. The service is slow, orders has been missed and forgotten."}
{"text":"Awesome combo deals. The spicy tuna and spicy Mexican roll are delicious.  The emergency is my favorite.  Great taste.  Very fresh. They have excellent customer service and prompt response.  I like to pick up and go. Everytime it is seamless. I even have a cup of miso soup while waiting for my order and it's tasty. I would recommend this place to anyone for anytime during the day. I can grab lunch on the go or sit and have a nice dinner here"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got 4 1/2 stars. Service was ok, not amazing as how other yelpers described. Mind you I tried this place because of the reviews, bad idea. I should've stuck with my regular sushi spot, even if it meant driving 20 minutes rather than the 5 minutes for this place.   Service: went in on a Friday afternoon, it wasn't busy yet. I was sat immediately.   15 minutes later other customers started trickling in. The server only came to my table a total of 5 times. (I chose the all you can eat) I had to flag him down most of the time.   Food: sushi wasn't as fresh as I thought it would be. And the fish was cut so small and so thin. I literally could eat 30 pieces and still wouldn't be full. (I'm 5'5, 138lbs just in case someone was thinking I was a fat ass.)   There wasn't any hamachi collar or salmon collar. The menu was actually very small.   Oh and no dessert as well on the AYCE menu, which was a complete bummer for me because I've such a sweet tooth.   So all I'm all, never coming back here. Is rather spend my $26 somewhere where the menu and the quality of the sushi is better.   Btw (again) I so know what fresh and quality sushi tastes like. Growing up from Hawaii fresh fish is everywhere. :-) mahalos!"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi enthusiast and let's just say I was not impressed. I was hoping for this place to work, since being so close to home.... I give it 3-stars because the food was somewhat edible and the deep fried oreos were yummy.  Let's start with the nigiri: The rice to fish ratio is just off, too much rice!! Also, the rice was pretty dry and was crumbling while I scooped them up.  I do gotta give them credit for their uni and amaebi though. Definitely one of the freshest I've tasted at an AYCE establishment:   I always have to get myself the necessities. Miso soup, cucumber salad, and etc. The miso soup was bland and the cucumber salad was really dialed up with the vinegar.   Despite other reviews about bad service, to my surprise it wasn't bad at all. Would I be going back? No."}
{"text":"Sushi is just average and ok. Equal to some grocery store sushis. Will definitely make a better choice!"}
{"text":"I love their all you can eat sushi.  They make their Nigiri small so I can eat tons.  Decent selection and quality of raw fish.  Good value/price.  They have a lot of specially rolls too.  One of my Go-to sushi place when I have cravings"}
{"text":"The owner is VERY annoying. After ordering AYCE she stealthily watches orders/tables to see what and how much food people are eating.   The staff, Danny, Brent and Michael are amazing. Sushi is good, but lately it's just not the same. It's just not quality like things used to be. Very upsetting....I really used to enjoy coming here. I don't plan on coming back for awhile, especially when the owner is there. She's just too overbearing. Cheap!!!  Update  This place sucks!! Can't stand the owner!!!! I brought my mom here from Michigan. We sat down around 9pm. The menu states that all you can eat ends at 10pm. Right after we ordered, the owner walked in and said, \"we won't serve all you can eat. It's too late to order\". We pointed out to her that the menu said \"all you can eat\" ended at 10pm. She continued to say she would only allow us to order \"a la cart\". She advised that she saw the menu clearly said 10pm...but at the spur of the moment, she decided the kitchen was not going to serve all you can eat...even though only one person at the table wanted the AYCE. ILL NEVER SPEND MY MONEY HERE again."}
{"text":"Seating was fast. Even we sat at The Sushi bar, our server was better taking our orders than the Sushi Chef.  Kinda of defeats the purpose of sitting at bar than a table.  We did AYCE, and even reasonably price, many items not available like other AYCE places.  The fish was not as fresh ad I like, but it's close to home, and would do in a pinch.  Another negative, no Red Bean ice cream, my favorite.  Only Green Tea, Chocolate,  and Stawberry.  That may be a good sign there for considering this establishment."}
{"text":"Sushi was mediocre at best. The rice wouldn't stick together. The seaweed was so chewy I couldn't bite through it. Eel tasted \"off.\" Nothing with a \"wow factor.\" What do you expect from an all you can eat sushi place, really though. The tuna poki appetizer was pretty damn good: I will come back just for that.  Service was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Learned recently the restaurant was under new management, so decided to give it a try. Hands down one of the best sushi joints I have been to in Las Vegas! Owner greeted & sat us as we came through the door, felt immediately welcome. The establishment was clean & the staff was helpful. We ordered many rolls, (Woo Chu roll, Sunshine roll, Shery Roll...) every one of them was tasty.. Don't forget to try the deep fried Oreos for dessert; so amazing. The tempura was hot, the beer was ice cold & dinner was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi. Fresh and friendly staff. Good value for AYCE.  The bar is the place to eat.  Don't order the rolls, just have the skilled chefs make their favorites for you. Awesome."}
{"text":"Have to give a one star. Service is about negative 2 stars and the food is about a 2 bringing it to 0 stars which isn't an option. I can't tell you how many times I've gone here and they have forgot something I've ordered. So sad. You're the only sushi spot in southern highlands, get it together so I can give you guys one last shot."}
{"text":"Literally the BEST SUSHI EVER!!!! Couldn't be better. Great quality and amazing service."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time since before when it was Xtreme Sushi and through the new ownership change. I must say that I love it the most now that the new owner(s) has/have taken over. The food is a lot more consistent. They've added some new artwork and chairs which made the atmosphere a whole lot nicer and tied everything together more with the decor. Plus they got rid of the awful grimy menus that had seen better days and have added new rolls, my favorite being the Burn Your A** roll. The Yoshi roll from the past is still on the menu so it looks like they've kept some of the more popular rolls. I'm pretty sure that they will accommodate orders from the old menu in case there's something you miss from before. It's a lot of the same people that work here so that's half the battle right there.  The employees are all great and personable. It's very much like the tv show Cheers type atmosphere. Once they get to know you, they will roll out the red carpet, including remembering your name and what you order to make you feel at home. I'm just waiting on my little name plaque at the sushi bar where I always sit. ;)  It's the little things like this to consider when there are so many other options for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. They really care and appreciate your business here. Therefore, I vote in favor of trying out this local gem.  PS: Why in the hell did someone upload a photo of their dog in their review of this place? I love dogs like the next person but seriously? WTF!?"}
{"text":"We come here often, for many reasons, but the service is at the top of the list (okay, and the veggie tempura rolls)! The new menu is the right amount of simple and delicious. The staff is always friendly, personable and prompt.   Just to give you an example of how great customer service is at Kazuki Sushi...My friend is vegan, so she passes on dessert while the rest of us enjoy our yummy green tea, red bean or vanilla ice cream. Well, the staff has been known to pick up on her lifestyle diet and has brought out orange slices for dessert, without her having to ask for it! You don't just come here to eat, you get an experience too!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times during early afternoon since it's close by my house .Highly recommend to friends n family but tonight won't be the same we walked in at 9:15 pm  when we ordered all you can eat we were told no more eat all you can at this time n can't order Hamachi Kama grill closed. By 9:45 pm all the fishes are removed from the counter started  to clean up , Hours are from 11am til 10 pm All you can eat  accdg to menu , At least serve us til   9:45 pm . Or change your business hours ."}
{"text":"The rolls were great! Although the nigiri could use some quality improvement.  I also preferred their old style screaming orgasm. The current one still has the awesome sauce but it is lacking certain things.  Overall, great meal. I really enjoyed the rolls.  Especially the yoshi roll! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"So.... It all started out amazing... He was really nice when we sat down & was very attentive.... We asked if they were closing and he said no but said we had to sit on one side of the dining room because he was closing the other, even this was no big deal... The first rolls were great and we love sushi so we kinda know what we like... The restaurant was decorated very well... Over all it started good! Last roll, the one I wanted the most, was bad... The soft shell crab tasted burnt and fishy... I do understand that taste is a thing that changes from person to person but we both did not like it at all... still It all could have been ok but the server and the staff behind the sushi bar proceeded to eat the roll in front of us and say it tasted fine... Basically mocking us... I have worked in the industry for a long time and this was the most disrespectful thing I have ever experienced... Not only will we never eat there again but I am sorry but I am going to make a point to never recommend this place to anyone... Leaving the disrespectful part of this out by Heath code standards the place should be shut down for that alone.... We only left a tip because we never leave less the 10%. Hopefully this review gets to the right people..."}
{"text":"I love this place! Within walking distance, and never fails to satisfy. Eric is awesome, and the food is amazing. I wish I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"I like it. We used to always do another place in town, see my reviews, and my family started here recently. My kids (6 & 8) say they like it \"better\" though the manager / owner seems a little crazy about the one hour limit on the all you can eat, even when busy and all slows down but then it is about table turn. The staff seems nice and the food on the 8 visits has been good and consistent. I do like better than the old Extreme Sushi of the same location. As a side plus, the servings are a nice mix or fish and rice, not just a brick of rice. It is small, and often fills up, so be ready for a wait or figure the busy times."}
{"text":"We went for a quick take out meal. They weren't very busy inside. There were only about 10 people. They seemed a bit unorganized and confused. We wanted to order takeout and they walked passed us a couple times before actually taking our order. It took about 20-25 min to get our food from the point that we ordered it. They had the food sitting on the counter for a good 7-10 minutes before finally giving it to us. The meal stated that it included a miso soup and when we arrived home we were disappointed that it wasn't given to us with our takeout. If it's not offered with the takeout option they should definitely mention that during the order. All in all, the employees were nice and I ate all the food."}
{"text":"Well folks...bad experience!  The owner (female) says to me (very arrogantly) that she \"does not care that I Yelp her.\"  She also, said my review \"won't effect her business at all.\"  I care and I care enough to tell you Yelpers out there!  I was eating the \"all you can eat\" with my 2 year old son.  Note: Children eat free.  I ordered 4 pieces of tuna and salmon, and shrimp tempura/rice.  My son ate 3 pieces of shrimp tempura and a couple of bites of rice (because that is how 2 year olds eat, right?).  There was so much rice on my tuna that I broke a piece off and didn't think too much of it.  There she comes storming over and demands that I eat my rice or I'd have to leave!  And then tells me (very loudly) that my son \"is getting too big and costing her a lot of money.\"  She pulls the plate from him and asks us to leave.  Yes, pulled food from a toddler!!! This story is 100% true!  I was so shocked and said to her in addition to Yelping her, \"you are losing a frequent customer that comes once and sometimes twice a week.\"  She said...\"I don't care.\"  P.S. food over priced, not always fresh and only half the menu is available for all you can eat."}
{"text":"Very sad that Extreme Sushi is gone, and replaced by these clowns.  I order a few sets of nigiri and all of a sudden, a 1 hour limit is placed for ayce by this boisterous Chinese lady.  I take a photo of the fine décor by the chef, and the same lady comes over and asks me why I'm taking pictures of their food.  She says \"It's all the same?'  Which I cynically replied,  \"Your sushi is the same as others?\"  \"Yes, its all the same!\" she replied.  In the menu, I ordered a red snapper.  I got a tilapia. Would of been better with a perch, but, that would've been easy to tell by texture.  The worst Japanese restaurant of all times. \"Sushi\" is Japanese cuisine. Kauzuki Sushi is a disgrace to the cuisine and its culture. I feel sorry for the chefs to the point that enrages me. At least, the chefs I watched were very good chefs."}
{"text":"Workers were nice. I'd probably come back again to do the AYCE which is a better price because I felt like it was too expensive for one roll. I had the Las Vegas roll which was tasty. They had a good assortment of rolls on the menu"}
{"text":"My family and I came for dinner and were expecting great service, but instead we got the complete opposite. When you enter a restaurant, the expectation is to be greeted and seated by the waiter. The waiter didn't even bother to sit us down at a table. Second, after ordering all you can eat the waiter messed up our order because he didn't even bother to write it down. We ended up waiting an extra hour for our food to arrive."}
{"text":"Small little sushi joint with friendly sushi chefs and wait staff.  They have Fried Shrimp Heads as part of the AYCE menu! Total score already! I eat these suckers like chips! Nom! Nom! Nom!  Scallops are one of my favorite things to order but unfortunate they have the little tiny bay scallops and they aren't very buttery and delicious. Also they didn't have my very favorite Tobiko + Quail egg. :(  They do offer half rolls as well. I tried the Burn Your Ass roll and honestly it wasn't even spicy. Not for my palette anyway. The sushi chef then created his own spicy roll concoction for me but it still wasn't super spicy. It was delicious tho!!  Ahi poke, screaming orgasm, octopus, seaweed salad and the other nigiri was all pretty good tho."}
{"text":"Sushi tasted kinda fishy. They have very small portions for what they charge. Don't go to this place. Take a drive down Silverado ranch and go to Sushimon instead."}
{"text":"I most said I'm no a great fan of Sushi but this place is a good one . Great service by the owner all, friendly staff, clean, the food was great even if you no to eat Sushi o seafood is a small menu with other choice... I will definitely come back.."}
{"text":"Second time to this location, still great food and service. Walked in 20 minutes before closing, they were super helpful with choosing rolls. The soup and rolls were super delicious. Will be back again"}
{"text":"Amazing place, it's our neighborhood sushi place here in Southern Highlands.  Fantastic food, reasonable price, and great service."}
{"text":"This used to be called Extreme Sushi and recently changed ownership.  I would have given Extreme Sushi 3-4 stars but under the new ownership it's essentially the same food (there are some new menu items and some have been removed) except that the prices have gone up and the portion size has gone down.  This is not a $14 per specialty roll kind of place.  The quality and portion size just isn't there. Since this is the only sushi place in Southern Highlands, I think I'll be driving an extra 10 mins to go elsewhere for my sushi now."}
{"text":"The female owner has some serious issues. The two guys behind the sushi bar were great. I told one of them about my sesame and gluten allergy and he immediately changed his gloves and brought me GF soya sauce. The female owner came out having a hissy fit saying the sauce is not for customers and TOOK THE SAUCE AWAY!! LOL!! She then proceeded to argue with us until we finally said ok maybe it's best we leave since we don't feel welcome and she just said YA GO!!! Hahahaha!! Great way of running your business lady!"}
{"text":"Very good Sushi place and awesome customer service but not happy about Sashimi not included in AYCE and no Mochi ice cream."}
{"text":"If you like good sushi then this is the place for you. If like like all you can eat sushi, then this is definitely the place for you. I usually get the Woo Chon roll and it is perfectly delicious each time."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't done my review prior, and my apologies. This establishment is amazing, and the service is beyond great. The owners are the most passionate about their food, their team,and of course making it awesome for our neighborhood! I work on the Strip, and so many of my colleagues have come there based on my recommendation, and they were happy as well! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place and decided to give it a try.  LOVED it.   I've been there twice now. It's a small but beautiful restaurant. Walking in, you see a beautiful piece of granite on the wall, with jade green accents in the decor and furniture. The sushi bar top is the centerpiece of the place along with the granite slab wall.   So far I've tried the Yoshi roll and the Salmon Bento. The sushi was fresh and the bento was accompanied by a nice miso soup. The tempura veggies were light and crispy, and the dressing on the salad was unique and tasty.   Lastly, the people working there were very polite and friendly. Overall an amazing experience. I'm happy I live so close to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Make it a go-to for sushi.  What it takes is frequent visits, and good tipping.  Once your face is known and the chef's get to know what you like, the magic happens.  These guys are really into creation and visual effects, but the average sushi/rice eater would not appreciate or understand.  But once you are chatty and smiling with them, they relax and create things both beautiful and delicious.  I'll say it again, put in the time to make a relationship."}
{"text":"Second time here. Can't complain about the food as I didn't have a chance to eat. This time around   Yelp says closes at 10:30 it was 9:45 I just wanted to get miso soup. The guy tells me sorry we close at 10. All I wanted was soup. Oh well if they don't care for the customer or even being polite about it I probably wouldn't want the food they would have served me feeling like I was a bother. Partly my fault for waiting til almost closing more there fault for handling it poorly. I would have been fine and understanding had they been professional. Be polite it goes a long way.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I went for an early dinner there with my sister and it was far from Amazing. In fact it was probably the worst sushi I have had in a long time. We go out for Sushi quite a bit, it is definitely one of our favorite types of food.   We ordered the all you can eat menu. It turned out to be happy hour (around 430pm) and it was $16.something per person. We ordered some non sushi items at first: seaweed salad which had way too much dressing, spicy salmon salad which was dry and was drowning in tempura bits - it was terrible compared to other restaurants, the shrimp tempura was ok, the beef short ribs was overcooked and hard, the fried beef udon was probably the best thing on the entire menu! and even then it was mediocre compared to others. Then came the sushi: the salmon sushi and red tuna sushi in terms of appearance was not appealing (i wish i took pics to really express how bad it was), the salmon looked very dry and it had been sliced for a very long time, prepared and stored in less that optimal temperature as it was warmer than room temperature. The rice was hard and the edges of the salmon was turning colour. The red tuna was also dry but the edges of this was getting hard and stiff, again the rice was hard. There was also no wasabi under the fish (this is how sushi is supposed to be served!) We also has the Kazuki roll which was very big and the fish was again hard and tasted very \"fresh\" There was spicy salmon and some other roll which we did not even try because at this point we were disgusted.   Our server was a young boy (maybe 14 years old) he was very quiet and cute... we actually felt bad to complain about it to him. But we said we did not like the food at all and would him to take it away and we will take the bill. He apologized and said he would have to talk to the manager. He goes over and calls \"Dad\" and talks to an older man in another language (not sure what) and i suppose explains that we werent happy with the meal. He came back and said that we have to pay for the extra pcs that we didnt eat. So at this point we get a little angry and said that we are not paying for the additional pcs because the food was inedible, your fish was not fresh at all, all together very very poor grade sushi, We told him several times that we wanted to talk to the manager but he never came but instead talked to his son close enough to us that we could hear AND see him yet he refused to come to the table. After a few conversations he brought the bill with 50% the additional cost... so 50% off $14. so the bill was $45. something... I was getting upset and told him there is no way I am paying for that,... in fact he should be giving us 50% off our meals due to how shitty the food was. At the end of it all we still paid for our full meals, only to eat one small serving of fried beef udon... everything else sucked!   We went to this restaurant because the reviews were good and the pics of the place was nice. We were sadly mistaken and extremely disappointed in not only the food, but the service as well, and of course the way they handled the incident. I will never recommend this place to anyone and would highly recommend that the owners of this restaurant reconsider a business in fish if they dont know how to handle such a delicate ingredient.   Just to add - we paid the bill and drove up the street to KYOTO at Weston and Rutherford and had the all you can eat and it was incredible. :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi! We had 5 rolls: Papa, Sherly, Kazuki, Sakura, and Lisa-Lisa.  All amazing and fresh, love the new Sakura roll! The owner Eunice is warm and friendly, lives to joke and make you feel like family.  Try this place if you haven't found a good sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Had the all you can eat sushi, and the sushi wasn't put together very well. Soon as you touched it the whole thing would fall apart. The white tuna was crunchy?! I have been eating sushi for over a decade and was not to impressed."}
{"text":"Ordered a bento box to go. If you order to-go they won't give you the miso soup. But if you dine in, they'll give you the miso soup. Either way, you'll still get charged the same price. Doesn't make sense. I've been to other restaurants that serves bento box to-go and they include the everything. Ultimately, I'm not concern about a cup of soup, just the business logic here doesn't make any sense. The food was okay. Not the best in the area. I'm not a fan of businesses that doesn't have good business judgements. So I won't be dining or ordering here again."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I'm a big fan of, it has got to be rolls with cream cheese inside or rolls with eel sauce on top. Kazuki sushi has a (semi) extensive menu for ayce, and I was pretty delighted to see a good amount of rolls with cream cheese inside. I didn't know what I wanted because everything sounded wonderful.  My sister and I ended up ordering the *Lisa Lisa roll *Spider roll * Sherly roll (deep fried and my absolute favorite) *Red dragon roll *Yo! roll  and the chicken karage as an appetizer. We weren't big fans of the chicken karage but the rolls were very good! For dessert we got green tea ice cream with two fried Oreos :-)  I don't see any other sushi spots in Southern Highlands so I don't think they have any competition. They're located in the same plaza as Smith's but all the way at the end by Tropical Smoothie and a couple other restaurants.  Maybe it was still early but my sister and I were the only customers. The servers were awkwardly nice and because we were the only customers for awhile, service was incredibly quick.  It was definitely nice to try after passing by so many times when I did live in Southern Highlands. Unfortunately, I don't live in the area anymore so I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an amazing neighborhood sushi bar! The nigiri is extremely fresh and the chefs are quite knowledgeable. Service is fantastic and attentive. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"As always food is tasty, service is great and quick! Quiet and comfortable atmosphere, owner is friendly and cares about her customers!"}
{"text":"Wow so awsome one of chef is from Detroit the owner treats you like family I would recommend this place to any one doing shot with them all highly suggest this place"}
{"text":"Veggie tempura roll is the freaking bomb! Oshinko roll is also awesome! Love this place"}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing. I've had almost all the rolls and everyone is delicious. Super fresh and everyone is so nice. All you can eat is an amazing deal!"}
{"text":"Came here around nine the other night and the sushi was really good the only complaint I have is that they made us feel like we were inconveniencing them for being there. It was really a shame because I actually liked the sushi and it's right by my apartment but the customer service was just ok."}
{"text":"I went to Kazuki Sushi for all you can eat lunch on a Wednesday (work day, only had an hour). I went with my dad, mom, and sister. I was very impressed with the food and the quick service and I left stuffed silly! We ordered: Spicy salmon salad (my kind of salad, there were no veggies lol!) - this was delicious, highly recommend. Salmon sushi Butter fish sushi (amazing) Spicy salmon sushi Miso and udon soup (really great and it came out HOT) Seaweed salad (this wasn't my favourite, but it wasn't bad) Grilled salmon, chicken, beef Beef skewer Chicken fried rice Tempura Salmon and avocado rolls Red bean ice cream.  I absolutely loved everything we tried. The spicy salmon salad was spicy, crispy, and delicious. The sushi rolls were fresh and the fish tasted great. My dad does not like Japanese food so we ordered everything cooked for him and he loved it. We enjoyed this place so much we are planning on going back next week for lunch! They have 15% off as they just opened. I would definitely recommend Kazuki Sushi. A great AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi fan and haven't tried it here. However, I did have a bento box and it was delicious.  The veggies were my favorite. I can't say anything else because I didn't personally pick it up but the food that I ordered was yummy."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and lacked freshness. Then found a hair in my seaweed salad and they did nothing about it. Know one here wears head nets or hats. I would void this place."}
{"text":"AYCE. Clean, small place in Southern Highlands. Food was not bad. Service was slow to be seated and getting orders taken but all in all, good experience.   Uni and amaebi were good. Had green tea ice cream and deep fried oreos. My daughter liked the Alaskan and I thought the Vegas roll was pretty flavorful. Husband ordered a bunch of nigiri items that were fresh and tasty.   I recommend sushi lovers try this place at least once to get an impression as it seems there has been change of ownership, per prior reviews."}
{"text":"So i always end up coming back here as they r close to home.  This time was another outstanding experience.   Great food and chit chat.  Prices have gone up a few bucks for all u can and no lunch or dinner separation.   Its just all u can eat.    I especially liked this experience as the young man i had a problem with last time came up to me n apologized.  This made me feel good.  Big props chef.    Good place to eat at if u have the chance."}
{"text":"This is a simple local sushi spot. The bento combos are great for the price. My only complaint is that is constantly smells like cigarette smoke. They must let their works smoke right out back or smoke in their work clothing and then come back in."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great prices and great variety! I love the sunshine roll! My hubby loves the spicy tuna crazy! The staff is great too! Very attentive  and make a good effort to learn their locals!"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely WAY above any other place I've been in Vegas!!!! It doesn't matter if it's super busy on a weekend or a slower day during the week.... I've never received anything other than incredible service! The sushi chefs are experts and more than happy to create your special order... or if you come here enough they'll just surprise you with phenomenal concoctions you didn't know you even wanted.... until you taste it.... and you don't know how you ever ate that basic roll before! Michael, in particular, has been our go to guy from day 1! Try it once and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here since it changed ownership. I was very impressed.   Service was great. They pointed out that the all you can eat would be cheaper than the ala cart I already ordered saving me some money.  Highlights were the tempura shrimp and the Spicy Tuna Crazy Roll.  I will be back, frequently."}
{"text":"Wow quick and easy sushi place right down the street from my house! The nigiris have big cuts of the sushi and it's soooo fresh! All the nigiris melt in my mouth and there's no nasty fishy after taste like some low quality places! Food gets served super fast here and they have awesome service! The staff is super friendly and they have really good rolls as well! I like the rolls but when I find an AYCE sushi place that has consistent, fresh, super good raw fish-that's when I get SOLDDD!   Everything here is amazing! I absolutely love love love it and how convenient it is being so close to where I live! I come here very often so believe me when I say it's consistent 10/10 both on the service and food!   Make sure you guys check this place out if you're ever on this side of town! I'm inlove!"}
{"text":"Prices = average to slightly above average ($20-25 per person) Freshness = above average Menu choices = poor/ below average Specials= not attractive at all (we went for the a la carte instead) Food tasted= very poor wasabi=terrible (didnt dissolve, not spicy at all)  Let me explain. Ingredients were super fresh and good quality but on top of nothing really standing out on the menu, even the regular stuff wasn't great tasting because it wasn't prepared well (maybe chef is inexperienced?). Amount of fish on sushi maki rolls was less than average, filled with lots of rice and veggies. Even my favourites (dynamite, rainbow, spider) were not good tasting at all.  Miso soup tasted like soap (I've tried packet/instant ones and even they are better)  Seaweed salad was pretty good.  Hand rolls were an exception to the poor sushi experience and were average quality.    The business seems family owned and operated- I think if they want to turn it around and make money they need a better sushi chef and rethink the whole menu.  Parking is free and location is convenient."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place more stars, but what I experienced just doesn't fly with me. I have been going there occasionally and usually order one thing. After I finished my lunch yesterday, I noticed a food container where they are preparing sushi rolls labeled with a \"2/17\" date on it...I was having lunch on 2/28. I am truly hoping that this was a labeling error, but that's pretty scary when ordering raw seafood. Not sure if I will be back - I think I will be too skeptical and not be able to enjoy my meal :-/"}
{"text":"Wife wanted to try this out. And totally worth it. Very pleasant wait staff, and tried standard bento box (teriyaki beef and tempura). Tempura was fresh, crunchy, not greasy. The beef is crunchy, which is different, but in a good way! My son got the teriyaki chicken rice bowl and like the fact that the chicken is charbroiled, not just boiled, as some places are wont to do. My wife tried the Sakura and sunshine rolls. They were Freshly made, the salmon and yellowtail were generous portions, with the wonderful buttery feel of a good piece of  fish. Will definitely venture out here again soon :)"}
{"text":"Awesome all you can eat excellent service . Not one of those places that's  trying to stuff you with rice. Wonderful tuna poki. All the rolls were excellent!  They also offer a couple other raw fish based salads good stuff."}
{"text":"This place never fails just overall TERRIBLE!   From their food... Their service... Their humor... Their lack of interest in customers.  It boggles me how they remain open!   The servers seem to get personal enjoyment out of charging people the higher price rather then mentioning it's an AYCE spot... The kind service thing would be to charge the customer the cost of AYCE. FAIL.  Two Cali rolls and a spider roll for my kiddo... $35.00.  Big mistake!!  Lastly, ginger, they barely packed any then laughed saying we usually skip bc people don't eat it... Uhmm... For $35.00 for two very Americanized rolls with NOTHING fresh there better be ginger!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the few sushi places I've been to that actually has good customer service. I no longer have to sacrifice quality for service, because this place delivers both!"}
{"text":"The food and service were great. We had the sushi bar all you can eat. The sushi chefs were polite, generous, and very creative the fish was extremely fresh. We specially enjoyed the nigiri sushi."}
{"text":"a casual sushi date ended up turning into a sushi, beer and sake turn up. so awesome.  I have to say, out of the couple times I've been here, I am never disappointed by these guys. came here for date night and of course we went with the all you can eat. my favorite choices of course are the garlic tuna and cajun albacore nigiri. I introduced my sig oth to some white tuna nigiri which is soooo good cause it literally was like biting through butter. if you're a \"texture\" kind of person, proceed with caution.   also introduced him to the baked mussels which I definitely recommend anyone who hasn't tried it to try that too! our sushi chef hooked it up with a speciality roll creation of his own because we asked him to surprise us. he named it the \"pacquaio punch roll\" which was a combo of spicy tuna, crab stick, spicy mayo and something else. so. freaking. good!   what started off as just having water with lemon, ended up turning into us having 2 Bottles of sapporo.. then ended up taking shots of sake. our server was fantastic as well as the sushi chef. they were fun and made our dinner super entertaining to say the least :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Sweet people. If you're in the area, it's well worth the visit. Just say \"omakase\"...they will take care of you."}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace to all sushi resturants in the Las Vegas area! Service was terrible. Food was mediocre.  Walked in at 9:24, standing 5 mins waiting to be addressed so we can sit. Chef yells out that they close at 10pm. Get seated at 9:28. Hardly anyone in place btw. We are rushed to order ayce. We are last ones in resturant. Bus boy standing by register, confronts us and says,\" Are you done? You are last one here and we are waiting on you.\" Give him props for saying it so ballsy. We immediately leave and as we are standing in parking lot getting ready to call mgt,  the seus chef who is sitting on bench proceeds to tell us not to come back.  After reading the reviews here, calling mgt. wouldnt have helped.  Terrible place. Will never return. Hope it rots. Our community doesnt need a place like this."}
{"text":"Decided to pamper myself to all you can eat sushi. What a treat!!!! Walked in at noon was seating by Don who was also my server. Great service, amazing food, and the atmosphere was modern and clean. Don remembered my name, made great recommendations and also helped me get the exact things that I wanted. So friendly and great. It was the perfect way to pamper myself. I will defiantly bring people here and recommend it to friends and family.   Favorite: Happy Sanjay roll, Unagi, Octopus Poki, and the Green Tea and fried Oreo (absolutely amazing!)"}
{"text":"Their sushi and bake mussels are okay. I was disappointed tonight because I told the chef that I didn't want \"all you can eat sushi\" for $30 (after tax) because I get full fast but he talked me into getting it then tell me they doing \"last call\" in 5 mins after he charged me for all you can eat, well what was the point of offering it to me. Im currently here now, the place close at 10:30 but told me they're doing last call at 9:30 and I arrived there at 9:20pm. I feel cheated. Should of told me they were doing last call soon before he offered me \"all you can eat\"..... Oh and on Yelp they have their hours for closing at 10:30pm(finding this out last min because I ask) but they said they close at 10:00pm and they don't have time to change their hours on Yelp. I don't know if it's just Sunday's or everyday but seem like they were rushing to go, I had to ask the waiter for water, he didn't come back and check on me and I had to get up and order through the chef because the waiter didn't come. I had to keep calling on the waiter for soy sauce, water, wasabi, a bag, to go box, straw. They didn't even want me to take my last roll home after they tricked me to pay $30 knowing I only have 5 mins to order. I won't be back even though I've came here before in the past."}
{"text":"The food is good as is service when it's slow. We were there the other night and when it got busy our waiter forgot about us so had to flag down the owner. Food is nothing special but good for ayce. We had a Japanese lasagna, sunshine roll, baked mussels, burn your a**, and a few others."}
{"text":"Great Japanese restaurant in Southern Highlands. Very friendly and professional staff, I never had to ask for refills. I ordered sake sashimi and received larger sized salad because I didn't want the side of rice it normally comes with."}
{"text":"My brother and I stopped in here because we both wanted sushi and thought we'd give it a try. It was amazing! We had the AYCE at the sushi bar and we both agree that Chef Koong made our expeience perfect and the \"G Spot\" roll was the best we've ever had. My brother is a sushi fanatic and he agreed. If you go make sure that it's on a night where Chef Kong is there. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Met the owner when she was my customer. Went to check the place out and was very impressed. She wasn't there but her staff took great care of me and my friend. The hand rolls were excellent and the fish was very fresh. I recently moved closer by so I plan to visit more often!"}
{"text":"Foe the first few visits, my thoughts overall was that they had great sushi and service, surprisingly one of the best sushi experiences I've had.  Came here twice and the employees and establishment is very chill.  A big tv for sports, and quick, prompt orders.  As time goes by and a few more sit downs , the food has gotten slightly bland.  Good still yes, also they didn't have a lunch special pricing at the usual $21 for lunch like before.  Will wanna visit again soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for his birthday because it is close to where we live. Service was outstanding and quick. Fish was delicious and fresh. Rolls were flavorful and fun. All you can eat sushi can be scary but this was delicious. Prices are great and they let us bring in our own sake for a small cork fee. I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Very solid sushi spot. I feel like everywhere I go it's pretty much the same menu but here they have a great new variety of roll. Very fresh, customer service was on point and they have playoff basketball playing. Fried Oreos were amazing too. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Good, not bad, not terrible, but not incredible, that's how I would describe this sushi place. let me put it this way, I would eat there again with out question, would I make a special trip? Not a chance. But if you find yourself in the area it's good, not bad, not terrible but not incredible. There you have it. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"AWESOME! Food is delicious and the staff are great! Funny, courteous and attentive!  This is a great option if you live near here or are in the area."}
{"text":"Love the bento plates.  Great prices, big rolls. Staff is always nice and fast. Never a long wait."}
{"text":"I always get great service here when I come in. The sushi is fresh and the chef's are prompt. Definitely my new favorite spot =)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would. I checked times and they said they were open till 10pm. It was about 940 when I walked in. One other table was occupied and about 4 workers just standing there. I was about to sir at the bar because it was just me. And the waiter said they were only doing to go orders. Seriously? 20 min before close and you can't serve someone? Not very good customer service. They should change the hours to close at 945pm, that.more like it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I were craving sushi so we thought we'd try this place since it's close to home but totally not worth it. They greeted us when we walked in but after we got our drinks I was just annoyed. The server was nice but wasn't attentive at all. Luckily we ordered a lot for our first round of AYCE because they never came back to ask us if we wanted anything else. The sushi was just okay AND they messed up our orders ... I'll make the drive next time to one of our other sushi places"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Beautiful presentation and friendly service!  All you can eat is incredible deal for this quality!"}
{"text":"Oh my god what a TERRIBLE experience! The server who was working was nice and helpful but apparently we made the mistake of sitting at the sushi bar. Initially, a Japanese sushi chef greeted us and he was super nice and cool. He got us plates and happily answered a few questions. But then, out of nowhere this second sushi chef comes in and steamrolls the whole thing. He hands us more plates and completely ignores the fact that we had clearly already been greeted. He couldn't handle even the most basic question.   We asked \"so this sashimi platter, could we get it with nigiri instead?\"  And his response was \"nigiri has rice\".... yeah. We know. Which is why we want it. So you're still not going to answer our question?? Then he says \"umm. Well how much is it??\" We don't work here dude! Just say yes or no (or even better: let me find out for you!) Don't give us pop quizzes on YOUR menu.  Honestly we should have taken all that as a sign to not order anything because the food was SO MUCH worse.   We ordered 2 pieces of sake nigiri, 2 pieces of maguro nigiri, 1 cup of miso soup and an iced tea. The maguro was cloudy and off color. It tasted terrible and old. The sake was better but only slightly. It didn't have the \"velvety melt in your mouth\" taste that it should. The miso soup had no tofu or wakame and wasn't even very hot.   But I will say this. The iced tea was delicious and the server was super nice. If this review gets noticed, please make sure the server working today (we came in around 1pm for lunch on Halloween) gets a pat on the back. If it weren't for him, this would have been a 1 star.   Conclusion? Do not recommend."}
{"text":"The excellent service here tipped this review up to 4 stars.  At $27/ per person with no lunch price, this is a pretty pricey for AYCE - but kids 3 and under are free so that is a definite plus for young families.    This sushi is decent enough, but they are stingy with the fish which made my nigiri very disappointing.  The fish is fresh, though, and my husband raved about their baked mussels because they weren't covered in mayonnaise and had a different more flavorful sauce than most place.  I also thought the uni nigiri was a lot better than I was expecting at a AYCE joint."}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot. Every time we've been there and they've had great service and it's like family. The prices are great and will definitely be coming back on a regular occasion"}
{"text":"Not bad. First time trying this place out. I got the 3 combo bento came w/: House salad (good) Miso soup (tasty, but barely any tofu or seaweed) Chicken (breast part of chicken, dry, but tasty) Mixed Tempura (good) Steamed Rice (I asked for sushi rice instead) Your choice of a basic roll: I got yellowtail+avocado (good, presentation wise...they just cut it up and threw it on the plate, but tasty)  All in all, everything was my favorite word for this review \"Tasty.\"  Well be back again since close to home.   Oh and I love their chairs and table."}
{"text":"Tried it out for the first time and we had the all you can eat . Employees friendly and food was good . we left satisfied ;)"}
{"text":"When this place was extreme sushi it wasn't very great, we usually make our drive to sushi mom for sushi. But they have changed this place up aLOT the service is great, especially sitting at the bar . Michael was an awesome sushi chef! Making little creations for my husband and he loved it! Very personable and respectful and nice! This will be our new regular sushi joint and we will def. be back to see Michael !"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere , amazing service, very friendly stuff and food is delicious . Our new hot spot"}
{"text":"First time here, our server was awesome! Very knowledgeable  & the fish is super fresh. The portion for sushi & rice is good.. more fish than rice :D I'm totally a fan!  coming back here & we didn't have to wait for our food long so time restriction is no problemo. The spicy tuna Don was bombbbbb  mixed w/ the spicy mayo."}
{"text":"Southern highlands is far from Vegas. This sushi place is perfect if you don't want to drive fart away from home. The sushi is great. We got all you can eat. The sushi chef was interactive and he recommended items. The service could of been more prompt as far as ensuring that we are clearing plates to make room for newer items. 3rd time here."}
{"text":"Great Sushi, fresh ingredients and a great staff! If you wanna feel like in home you should eat here. Fully recomended!"}
{"text":"The worst ayce in vegas ! The owner is so cheap , and if you eat to much she'll ask you not to come to her restaurant anymore . Who does that to your customer ? If you don't like the fact that it's ayce then why even bother opening an ayce sushi place ? I do feel bad for the hard working sushi chef , but oh well. Just drive a few miles north of southern highland and you'll find yourself at a way better ayce sushi place . I'd skip this one . Oh btw she'll also get mad if you order the M5 roll . Lol"}
{"text":"I really don't come here enough. I love the food and the staff. I had a spicy yellowtail cut roll today and loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"They're rolls are really amazing and every time we go there, everyone is so sweet! Rolls come out really fast. Once when I went, the chefs accidentally mixed up which ones we ordered with soy paper instead of seaweed (he gave one of mine soy paper instead of seaweed even though I wanted seaweed) but other than that mix up, all of our experiences were great! I went there with my boyfriend one day and we ordered all you can eat. The waitress was literally cheering us on to eat as much as we could and we all had so much fun! We will definitely keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"First time here and definitely returning. The atmosphere is nice. I love the furniture, it's VERY retro. It's a small place but you don't feel claustrophobic. The food was EXCELLENT. I loved the cucumber salad and I had the 12pc SASHIMI. My friends had the all you can eat sushi and raved about it. The service was FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"Great service and fresh food.  Decent prices for sushi.  If you're lucky, you will catch the owner (I forget her name), but she's a sweet lady.  Small restaurant with a big menu."}
{"text":"The was our 1st time here since they changed ownership. The food used to be pretty good but this time We were extremely disappointed. We will stick to Oyshi ayce. Way better and are not stingy with the sushi.   The only good item was the ahi poki salad. The sunshine was good but there was the thinnest and smallest slivers of salmon on top and the California roll under was so thin. The calamari tempura appetizer was exactly 2 peices. It wasn't your traditional rings and squid, it was to rectangular pieces that were very chewy. Rainbow roll had the very small thin pieces of fish on top. The yoshi roll was terrible. I guess they torch it, it had black spots on top of the roll and it smelled bad and tasted even worse. It had a burned plastic smell. Eww.   The waiter however was extremely attentive and checked on us every few mins. We went in for 2 lunch ayce and ended up spending $70 bucks on a meal that was terrible. Just wishing we went anywhere else."}
{"text":"I read the negative reviews and wonder how we can be talking about the same place. The food is always good, the service is always great. And I am super picky about sushi. My family and I are here 3 to 4 times a month. The staff is super friendly, they never oversell me and give me the better price. I must have a warped sense of humor if you don't think they are funny because I am always entertained."}
{"text":"This place is very close to our house. We were there before for a take out order and the server and the sushi chef were nice so tonight we decided to eat there for our Mother's Day dinner. We arrived there at 6pm, doing AYCE, everytime we needed to wait 10 minutes or longer to order. The restaurant was busy and they only had one server. He was working hard but everything was slow because he couldn't handle that many customers; food came fast however. First and second round we already ordered everything we wanted to try on the menu. There were couple items we like so we decided to order third round. The female owner showed up. She said \"you want to order more? I think your time is up.\" There is no where on the menu states eating time and the place was not even full. I looked at my cell. It's 7:02pm. It's been only an hour and most of time we were waiting to be served. I looked at her back, then she keeping saying \"ok what do you want what do you want.\"   It kind of ruined our Mother's Day dinner so we left soon without ordering the dessert. This is the place(owner) offers AYCE but doesn't want you to order AYCE because they scare you eat too much. There are so many good AYCE sushi places in town, but definitely not this one.  Food was not too bad but nothing special. Rice ratio was big compared to other places.  The Sushi chef and the server were nice, but owner sucks. I really wanted to tip $0 but we still did 12% because the server was innocent. He should find another job since his boss is so cheap."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by this place after the great reviews I saw on Yelp. Right off the back I was greeted when I walked through the door and was amazed by the wide selection of choices on their AYCE menu. Our waiter was being shadowed by a new employee I believe and they were both of great help to my visit! Thank you Khylle for the astonishing customer service and I will definitely be back for another visit in the near future."}
{"text":"Yoshi roll.... the bOMB!!!  My husband and I like to always come to this tiny resto and would sit by the sushi bar.   Sushi Chef Michael always give an excellent service.  He never fails to ask us what we want next and would recommend awesome sushi selections.  I highly recommend  this place and Sushi Chef Michael."}
{"text":"Surprisingly slow for a Friday night. But it was cool! We just moved nearby and we didn't want to go into the city, so we found this place and we will be going here more often! Love the staff, Michael was mad cool. He was funny and he was definitely the best waiter I've ever had. Very attentive, laid back and super nice. The food was really awesome. We did the AYCE (last call is at 9:35, so make sure you get there before 9:00pm so you can really enjoy your experience) and it the sushi was fresh and presented to us very well. It was clean too and that's a plus for me! I hate dirty restaurants, but this one was spotless! Very cool, our bellies are full and we was happy with the service! We will be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"So let's get the bad stuff over with, lost  1/2 a star for the price, it's Vegas and I expected things to be more expensive but back home all-you-can-eat is $5 cheaper per person. Other 1/2 star lost for the funky ice tea, it definitely wasn't fresh brewed, tasted sour.   Now for the good stuff, they were fast, rolls came out quickly and good presentation, waiter was friendly and didn't give me a hard time about ordering all you can eat when hubby didn't do the same (many places have a policy that says  everybody has to order AYCE due to sharing issues). I like that they didn't have a fit about that."}
{"text":"I normally love this place, but it seems as though every time the owner is there, I have a less than satisfactory experience. I walked in to order take out and she said she would be right with me. Someone else walks in behind me and she tends to her first... it wasn't like I had stepped out of line or anything I was still In line. I let it go because I see that she's with postmates and the owner probably wants to just get the to go order finished. Okay cool, whatever it's no big deal. Soon as she's done with that she goes over to the sushi chefs and completely forgets about me. When she comes back, I'm still in line patiently airing for her to pay attention to me. Literally as soon as another couple walked up, she took her eyes off the receipts and counter and tended to them. Even..though...I was RIGHT THERE... in FRONT of her being skipped for the SECOND time now. Finally after a long time of waiting she takes me order. Simple California roll. After all that hassle the California roll was missing the cucumber . I still ate it, however I noticed immediately and will not be going back. I have gave them my loyal service for too long."}
{"text":"Order that yum yum scallop hand roll, ikura and the white tuna nagiri to go. Very disappointed in the yum yum scallop hand roll it literally had 1 scallop and the rest was shredded crab meat or what every that filler was. The white tuna was not bad and the ikura was ok."}
{"text":"Everything was FRESH it melts in your mouth and I love that you can order sashimi to goThe owner was genuinely nice. The shrimp tempura is cooked perfect!"}
{"text":"Baltazar is a really good sushi chef!! Knows all the menu... I really like this place it's my favorite! If you haven't try it, do it!!"}
{"text":"I was in this part of town and thought I'd stop by. It has become one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas. When ever I'm in the area I try to stop by."}
{"text":"This place is small. Great ambiance for a sushi place. They had NBA on so that was awesome in my book. It was not busy at all which made me wonder why some tables were left uncleaned.  I guess this place was once Xtreme Sushi since they still had super old menus with the old name. We came here because I got super hungry after going to the park nearby and TSC was already closed. They have AYCE and I kept going back and forth as to whether or not I should get AYCE.  All I really wanted was soft-shell crab and sashimi. So, I skipped AYCE.  Soft-shell Crab: Huge pieces of crab tempura. The dipping sauce was pretty good and citrusy. 4/5  Sashimi: I got 7pcs: tuna, hamachi and salmon. The bigger orders of sashimi include octopus. The quality of the fish was alright. They were small and thinly sliced...with a dull knife. The tuna had a weird fruity taste to it. 2/5  The service was so-so. Overall, this place was marginal. I wouldn't drive all the way out here just for this since I live on the opposite side of town."}
{"text":"I have lived in southern highlands for years. When the local sushi bar switched ownership I was initially disappointed, put off and refused to patronize. I am currently eating those words.  While I'm not in this establishment often, when I am i feel like Norm on cheers. They are immediately making my favorite rolls without direction, bringing out my appetizers and drinks before I even order.  The only reason for the 4 out of 5 review is when they are busy they don't work like a well oiled machine. Because my food and service is good I tend to be a tad more patient when they are busy.."}
{"text":"THEEEE BOMB! Rolls are perfect, fish is super fresh, atmosphere is a fun and modern for a sushi joint. Lastly, loved the staff. So happy we went it's our Southern Highlands go to Sushi spot now!  Oh ps. Pricing is great and reasonable. :)"}
{"text":"It was my 1st time here. The main reason for me going here was because I saw that they have all you can eat. What I learned when I sat down and ate was that only half of the menu is all you can eat. The half of the menu that is all you eat is nothing special or unique. I did try their nigiri and it was not fresh at all. Also the AYCE is WAY over priced. The service was good and extremely fast. Overall it was worth a try but I would not go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I walked in and asked for a table for one once I got someone's attention. But he looked at me and walked away into the back. After a few seconds of embarrassment I seated myself. Waited another few minutes for someone to come serve me and give me a menu. Once someone finally came, there was no greeting but asked me if I wanted a drink and gave me water instead of the tea which I had ordered.   The food is less ok but not terrible. The sushi dishes have WAY to much rice under a sliver of fish; which filled me up really quickly. Nothing seemed fresh either.   I wasn't the only one complaining about their meals either during my seating. A couple left and I overheard the man apologize to his partner for the service. Another table asked the waitress a question and the waitress replied with attitude. As they left she asked loudly \"No tip?!\" In which they confidently said no.  Even though I live close by, I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"i yelped this place and i wasn't disappointed .  quick and clean and friendly server .  food was hot and just the way i like it.  i will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I am only giving this a star because I have too. The quality of the fish is terrible. My son and I couldn't even eat the rolls we ordered because of how awful they tasted. And to top it off we still had to pay full price. I will never return."}
{"text":"We always go here it's never too busy and the service is good... The fish isn't as fresh as I would like but it's down the street and I've never had a bad experience here.. and the price isn't bad for all you can eat!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience under this new management. I wasn't being one of those needy customers and haven't even talked to one of the employees all night. He had served our dessert and happened to bring me a Mochi ice cream that was cut w a dirty knife. I had asked him to replace it for me and overheard him slamming things in the kitchen. When he came back out he literally threw it on the bar. I looked at the sushi chef and he started laughing and mocking him. Although the sushi chef had apologized for the other employees actions, that made me extremely uncomfortable that I didn't even want to finish and honestly didn't want to leave a tip but that wouldn't have been fair to the other employees who have been kind.   I wish I knew his name but he works behind the sush"}
{"text":"Owner is very nice,  respectful and personal.   Staff are very quick at servicing.  Food is great!   Fish always tastes fresh!  My family of 5 (including 1 infant)  eat here once a month.   We LOVE Kazuki Sushi!"}
{"text":"The fiancé and I were craving sushi, but didn't feel like driving to our normal spot so we decided to try our neighborhood sushi.   I must admit that I have not tried this spot since it changed from Xtreme sushi, but you can't complain if you don't try right ?     We were super tired so we just decided to order some rolls al a carte and take it home. What I liked is the guy recommended for us to get their special combo to get your money's worth, add another roll and save some money, why would I say no.    The rolls were done pretty quick, they show you the sushi before they bag it, and I liked how they put the sauces on the side.    Definitely satisfied my sushi fix for the night and we are definitely coming back for more !"}
{"text":"I am a resident at southern highland a regular customer when this restaurant use to be called Extreme Sushi.  I ate at this restaurant today for the all you can eat sushi and my friends and I noticed that there is a new restaurant name assuming it's under new management/owner. We went ahead an ate to try it out.  My whole table ate all you can eat and finish every single order. No food wasted. 20 minutes before the hour ended we decided to order 2 more rolls. The owner gave us an attitude and seemed like she didn't want to take our order. Food came and we finished the 2 last rolls we order and she gave us the bill.   Please note: dessert does not come will all you can eat like before with Extreme  Sushi!   Soon after we paid and we were the only customers left inside the restaurant the owner confronted our table and said \"she lost money on our table because we ordered too much\"! We were so shocked! I thought that is what \"all you can eat sushi is\"! And we followed the rules no food wasted!   She essentially said that she prefers for us not to come back and to go eat else where because she lost $50 dollars off our table!   Plus no dessert!   Please beware! This restaurant is a piece of shit! They should not be advertising \"all you can eat \" if the owner cannot afford it!   poor poor poor customer service! Now as a resident at southern highland I will have to find another sushi place!   This is the worst all you can eat experience that ever happened in my entire life!   My friends and I are very shocked and upset about this! She has no customer service!  Stay away. Go elsewhere!   ***Bad Customer service/ poor poor poor!  I hope this restaurant closes down. I am so upset so please save your energy and eat elsewhere like Sushi Mon!   I truly hope her restaurant goes down hill!   Nobody should be treated this way!"}
{"text":"Great local place.  The staff are friendly, the sushi is fresh and the place is clean.  We usually opt for the AYCE dinner. The staff do not avoid you after your first order like at some other places.  I have always left satisfied and full."}
{"text":"We had dinner here the other day. We shared a shrimp tempura, sushi/sashimi combo, and a rainbow roll. The food was good, everything tasted fresh. The price was on the expensive side (a little over $1 per piece). The location is convenient with ample parking and the decor was very nice."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst sushi place I've ever been too! The service was completely bad. The chefs do not attempt to ask you what you would like. Orders were never brought and waited over an hour to get appetizers and still didn't get them, and the price for the all you can eat is not worth going. The only people who actually did a great job were the bus boys!"}
{"text":"Exceptional Sushi light on the rice heavy on the fish the way I like it. Service was excellent. Love this place!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointing. This used to be the BEST sushi place around... Until the new ownership recently. Sushi was terrible... Small... And overpriced. I got a box which had TINY portion sizes. The soup bowl I got was half filled, the beef teriyaki was over cooked and terrible, the vegetable tempura consisted of 3 tiny pieces, and the salad was meh. The new owner supposedly is cutting down on portion sizes, which is quite obvious, but she is not cutting down on price. That, to me, is greedy and I don't think a good way to run a business. Although the owner was \"nice\", a few of her comments rubbed me the wrong way and her lack of attentiveness was ridiculous. (We asked for the check 3 times). We spent $40 and left so dissatisfied. Won't be going back anytime soon... Or at least until new ownership comes again... Which probably won't be long if the service and food remain the same. No way this place could stay in business. Don't waste your time here...."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place 2-3 times a week when it was extremely sushi... Have it a shot a couple times after management changed. No good.. So, I decided after months and months to try again today and it was TERRIBLE SUSHI.... People who worked there were friendly though ... I have sushi ALL over the city .. This place was by far still the worst"}
{"text":"I recently moved into the neighborhood and decided to pick up food on the way home from work. Everything was good. Service was friendly and the food was good."}
{"text":"Found this place by mistake GPSing our regular place. It's a 30 minute drive from our house but a well worth drive. Never disappointed coming here. Friendly staff and great food! One of the best All you can eat sushi places around Vegas! Needless to say it's become our new \"regular\" hangout."}
{"text":"I visited for my first time during my lunch hour yesterday.... I have to say that I had a wonderful experience! The staff is very friendly and very attentive.  Love the all you can eat option and the variety of rolls, appetizers, and desserts they offer! The food was fresh and very flavorful.    Try the deep fried Oreo dessert option- you will not be disappointed!   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I come here daily! The food is always fresh and high quality. Amazing prices. Nice staff, and it doesn't smell like fish when you walk in.   Plus, they wear gloves and are very sanitary."}
{"text":"This little sushi place has got to be one of my favorites. The service was extraordinary. Our server (brent) was quick and friendly and sugested really awesome rolls.  The quality of the fish was amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"burn your a**\" roll, tempura shrimp roll, and Alaska roll; they were excellent.  The employees were super friendly and we had a good time  :). I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because it's so convenient to me however their rolls are just on par as getting a roll from Smith's. Poke was the best dish we had."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the servers were nice and attentive. It was slow mind you so I don't know what it might be like on a busy day.  They asked if I wanted to have wasabi and ginger with my sushi which is usually put there by default and I feel bad when I waste it.  I'm actually glad they asked.  I had the spicy tuna hand roll which was pretty solid and the spider roll which was kind of a mess but still tasted alright.  I also ordered the teriyaki beef bento box and it's wasn't horrible but the entree lacked that certain something that makes you crave to return and have it again.  I really want to like this place more because the service was good and I may give it another shot."}
