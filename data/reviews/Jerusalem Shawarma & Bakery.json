{"text":"Great for take out or a casual meal. We had the chicken shawarma wrap and the falafel wrap. Fresh and authentic flavours. Customizable spice levels and good value. Next time I'm in Calgary I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is the best Shawarma place in Calgary, the hummus is so addicting, I've never been disappointed in fact I'm always left craving for more (Though the serving sizes are great by the way)"}
{"text":"Mmmm... This is our go-to place for chicken shawarma's. They're delicious. Just amazing. The baklava, garlic potatoes, and hummus are very good too. Not a fan of the donairs. Still gonna give it 5 stars because of how good the shawarma's are."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this restaurant twice now.  Both times have been terrific.    The only improvement I would recommend is that the cold salads not be packed in the same package as the hot food which causes the salads to no longer be crisp.  Overall, great food!"}
{"text":"This is probably THE BEST falafel plate/wrap I've had in years. They never under deliver. Fresh made falafels, great portions and friendly service. Lunch or dinner this place a must visit. Prices are more than fair."}
{"text":"Best shawarma plate in Calgary because it all goes together so well. From the creamy hummus with the garlic potatoes couples with the juicy sweet corn salad and not forgetting the deliciously marinated chicken and need over a bed of pilaf rice.  Plus its huge too, 2 plates feeds us a family of four well enough.  We live down south but gladly make the trip here for a bite. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"They no longer offer pickled turnips here. Portions seem to be smaller lately. Still delicious."}
{"text":"Best shawarma platter ever. Tried the grilled chicken one and it was AWESOME!! Love this place"}
{"text":"If you can afford to eat here I suggest you do so,  one of the best Shawarma's I've had. For a large beef Shawarma and bottle water cost $15 bucks, ouch!   I've always believed in the old saying,  'You get what you pay for'  and this place is no exception. Ingredients are fresh, staff are friendly and portions are Godzillian proportions. Establishment is very clean unlike some Shawarma places I've been to in the past."}
{"text":"Delicious Middle Eastern food with good service and fair prices! Must try!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Very fresh and the staff were really personable and quick to get through a long line! Definitely going to be my go-to donair and shawarma place in NW Calgary!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. We looked up this restaurant to change things up and didn't disappoint. Food was fresh, good quantity and helpful staff. Small place but will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst chk shawarma ever, dry as hell no taste whatsoever. Probably because the chicken I got was sitting under the skewer n not shaved to order. Shud b ashamed to sell that. Store is nice clean n presentable staff was courteous However looked and acted scared. Had the large chk sandwich for $11 n change. What a waste of chicken. Young skinny dude was very pleasant as I asked for more garlic sauce in my sandwich. Girl behind the cash was training a newbie they were also prompt n courteous. Best thing bout it the sandwich was the bread as they use a combination of Saj n pita bread to roll up the sandwich. 3aib 3alakum wallah"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Food is fresh, flavour is on point and portions are huge. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The best of the best of the best. The falafel is to die for. Simply put - full of flavour and authentic tastes. The baklava is delicious too!"}
{"text":"This has become a local favourite for the past year and a half. Outstanding service, exceptional quality and quantity.  We get our cravings and are never disappointed.  In my opinion one of the very best (if not the best) shawarma in Calgary."}
{"text":"Fresh ,tasty ,healthy ,very good quality.I love the food .Very good service .So quick service even all of busy line up .5 minutes for shawarma orders .8-15 for Fresh BBQ . Very organized team.They keep changing gloves on each service , never seen as clean as This tiny place ."}
{"text":"Tasty platter for two and so was the fattoush salad. The creamy corn salad was good too. However, the food took too long to come"}
{"text":"I've beeen to the middle east & this place is probably the best middle eastern cuisine I've been to in Calgary"}
{"text":"Ok let me tell you something iam an arab i lived my whole life in the middle east... This place has by far the best shawarma i have ever tasted in my life.... The shish tawook is also amazing..people that work there are nice and friendly and they really know what they are doing..."}
{"text":"Craving for Middle Eastern cuisine and this one satisfied my tastebuds and wallet. Ambiance and place is small but reasonable for this kind of business, known for more on pick up foods-shawarma sandwich. The beef kebab taste like i am back in Dubai where i had this dish (its a winner!), the rice is quite dry, i am not sure why i have potato in my rice plate but didn't had it coz the rice made me full already, per serving is really good size. Next time we will try the shawarma sandwich! Price is reasonable for $14 for a full plate. Display fridge has a variety of pop and baklava to go.  We bought Baklava and Falafel for to go but my husband drop the baklava and has 2 pcs left to try on, the syrup is quite watery but its still taste good."}
{"text":"I love their food but the service need to be better.Me am my wife were the only customers but still had to wait for 30 mins for our food.All the staff was busy with the Catering order."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for wraps and shawarma in the northwest part of Calgary. Very friendly staff. Hard to go wrong with any of the shaved meats. The kabobs are less great. Price is reasonable for awesome food."}
{"text":"Yes! finally found a great shawarma. I've had lots and have made it a point to find the best one in Calgary. Jimmy's is good, Cedars Deli is good, Desert Pita is good....but folks, Jerusalem Shawarma is Great! These are all direct comparisons...price / service / quality. Hands down this one is the best. Cant wait to get back and eat there!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is excellent and fresh! The portions are also huge! They are very busy during peak hours but get through the line quite quickly. They have 4 tables if you wish to dine in but they fill up quickly. I personally love the chicken shawarma wraps and plates. We tried the platter for two with the kabobs and it feed two adults and a toddler and we were stuffed! I've also ordered catering through them with excellent results. It's reasonably priced and everyone loved it."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the city to grab shawarma. The guys here are incredibly friendly and attentive. They always change gloves and the whole restaurant is pretty clean. The portions are quite large. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food, even felt healthy eating it. Told them I was from out of town and they went all out to provide good service and even through in a few desert."}
{"text":"Great Shawarma restaurant. Falafel is great. Went to Israel last year and this brought me back. Two guys provide great service and are very friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT! Delicious food, great prices, great service! I was with a big group of girls and had to place a large to go order and they did it with no problem and were super friendly about it (even when we said we had to pay separately:) ) When we walked in you could tell this place was a well oiled machine!! They have consistent traffic and a lot of ppl we're ordering large platters! (We probably should've done that, in hindsight haha) I tried the veggie platter SOOOOOO GOOD! Highly recommend it. The grape leaves were my favorite part, the hummus and falafel was delicious and that rice !! Oh my it's fantastic. Don't worry they don't skimp on servings at all!!   AND the baklava YUM!! Super moist, syrupy and sweet.  If you're in the area and are in the mood for Mediterranean food, you should definitely swing by this place."}
{"text":"OMG! The best hummus I have ever had in any country! In addition they have this delicious pear juice from Turkey called TAMMY. You have to try it. Everything from the salad, potatoes, kabob to the baklava was amazing. Only in Calgary for two days but had to eat here twice. It's a small little place in a strip-center in the suburbs. Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very welcoming owner (or who I assume was the owner). Two of us split the vegetarian platter and a shish tawouk skewer and it was a lot of food - plenty for two of us. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. The stuffed grape leaves were perfectly moist and lemony, the falafel had a great crispy outside to flavorful inside ratio, the garlic yogurt sauce on the potatoes was also good, and the chicken kebab was freshly put on the grill when we ordered it - very tender and flavorful! Would definitely recommend for a tasty freshly made meal for a bargain price."}
{"text":"Came here as t was highly recommended by a few peers. Well they did not disappoint. We ordered the chicken shawarma wrap and shish.tawouk platter. It was so good! They cook the skewers as they are ordered so they are Hot and fresh. Staff were very friendly. The owner/manager (I think ) was there making sure things are done right. I like seeing this because it shows that they really care about their business. Can't wait to go back and try other stuff."}
{"text":"Usually my husband and I pick up a donair and take it home, we love the food and the service here!  We decided to eat in one night and the experience was just as great!  I tried their hummus for the first time on their donair plate!  OMG it was so good!  I usually don't like hummus but I would eat theirs again!  The staff is highly efficient, well trained and extremely friendly to deal with!  Their food.... AMAZING! I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"a joint worthy of a 5 star review based on its shawarma alone, which given the reasonable price point, is a total steal! I tried almost everything available here and it does not disappoint.  This tucked away small shawarma place delivers sizeable , very delicious, reasonably priced food for those looking for take out or eating in (although seating space is limited). Driving here is worth the effort. The shop is located sort of far from the city, close to the airport (perfect if you are staying at one of the hotels nearby), and is next to the carwash nearby.  The portion sizes are massive, and the large shawarma is absolutely a redonculous size enough for 2 people, or even 3 if you aren't very hungry. The taste is quite good, make sure to get the extra tahinai sauce."}
{"text":"I'd been to the location on 16th Ave and really enjoyed it. Last night a group of us ladies went to this location and we loved it! The food is amazing and the service is even better than the food. We had such a great time there -  I think we stayed nearly 2 hours! The place is quite small and very busy, so go a bit early if you want a table, especially if you have a group larger than 4 and are eating in. There's one large table to the left when you go in, the rest are smaller. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time at this Mediterranean restaurant. Peeked in and saw a line up. Knew something must be happening in there. Ordered and ate. Not only was the pricing good, but the presentation and taste of food was great. Will definitely be going back. Called up a few friends and told them about this place. Very pleased!"}
{"text":"POTATOES HERE ARE AMAZING. Must try, and hummus is really good, and portions are big!"}
{"text":"This is perhaps the one of the best shawarma places in calgary. It is always so fresh, delicious and the servings generous. The Staff is very friendly. I would strongly recommend a visit. This is a Calgary Jewel."}
{"text":"At an overnight stop by Calgary airport, I found this place through Yelp reviewers. It is delicious - we had one falaffel platter and a chicken swarma platter. The food was delicious - seating inside was a little challenging. It is limited and the tables either seat 2, 4, and one is like a giant table/booth. Inside is nothing to write home about but there was a lengthy line that validated this place's popularity. It was a little hard to find in the corner of the shopping plaza. It is at the end with a green size across from the Kuman learning center."}
{"text":"Ok went here a few days ago and the service was amazing... the stuffed vine leaves were tasty and they even gave us two to sample first as we weren't sure if we wanted to buy them or not... I had the  beef kabob platter with Greek salad and my husband had the donair platter with Russian salad! The potatoes with garlic sauce are very tasty and the hummus is fresh (which is also sold in take home containers)! The portion sizes are decent!My favourite part of the meal was dessert ,I grabbed a container of baklava to go and I was pleasantly surprised as it wasn't overly sweet or impossibly chewy! Clean, friendly atmosphere. Will be back next time I want shawarma..."}
{"text":"Their Shwarma is one of the best I have had so far in town. Their meat is so moist and tasty. They also use two different bread to make it nice and easy to grab while eating. Whenever we crave donairs, We go here. People who work there are really nice. This place is always busy."}
{"text":"I have to remove a star as well,  ill take it because the food is good, but the tip and increased prices are currently ridiculously overpriced for market food.  soggy old overpriced baklava and its luke pulling teeth to get anything made fresh and cooked proprly."}
{"text":"Bada-bing After living in the middle east you come back to Canada searching for that shawarma that takes you back.   This place does it all for me.  If shawarma from this place could be married, I'd say: I do.    Perfect balance.  The hummus fresh as can be.   It's a twenty minute drive from my place but I'll make that trip."}
{"text":"Honestly have been here a few times and don't think this place even comes close to some of the other Donair and shawarma places in the city.   The prices are extremely steep, my friend ordered the kebab plate (comes with two kebab skewers) and asked for an additional kebab skewer. They charged him almost $20 ($14 for the kebab plate + $4.50 for the extra kebab + gst). I ordered a large Donair and can say that the portion was noticeably small for the $12 price tag.   The food however did taste good and fresh but the price of what you get really put me off this joint. Jimmy's A&A, Donair grill, and a few others are significantly better in my opinion."}
{"text":"I got the swarma platter and was stuffed when I finished eating it. All the ingredients were fresh and the flavors were great. The staff provided excellent service."}
{"text":"I've had shawarma on most continents and have to say this ranks right up there. Food is fresh and tastes delicious. Excellent care and attention is paid to your individual order. It does take a little bit of time, but in return you get some great tasting fresh food. Can't speak highly enough about how important that is to me. Anyway, I don't think you'd be disappointed one bit. Not to mention the long line that exists almost out the door. Obviously that says a lot about this place. Nice folks that work there too, very polite and customer service is spot on... I would probably reduce the price by a bit, but in all honesty they do such a nice job I was okay with the prices!"}
{"text":"Jerusalem Shawarma provides everything you want in a shawarma restaurant: great customer service, tasty food, large portions, occasional diarrhea... yep, this place is LEGIT.  I got food poisoning from their donair plate the first time I tried them even though my husband didn't (he had the shawarma plate). Basically I was all like  \"NEVER AGAIN\" and avoided Jerusalem like the plague while my husband continued to try other items from their menu over the course of time. He'd rave about their juicy flavorful meats while I watched him eat with mixed feelings of disgust and envy.   It took a lot of prodding from him to get me to try Jerusalem again, and it was definitely better the second time around when I had their made-to-order chicken skewers and avoided all sauces. Nope, no diarrhea this time.   If you want to dine in, you'll never get a spot during peak hours. They have like 5-6 tables and get filled quick. Take out is pretty quick option. If you want the skewers, be prepared to wait 15 minutes for them to cook or just call ahead of time.  I'm hoping my illness was a one time fluke because Jerusalem really is tasty. Their rice is seasoned well, the meats are delicious, and the salads are fresh. It'd be a pity to write them off but I think I managed to find a winning combination. Yay!!"}
{"text":"Okay.... I eat a lot of falafel, like a lot, and this place had perfect falafel. It had a great flavor, was crispy on the outside and soft and delicate on the inside. The servings are massive for the cost and everything I had was absurdly tasty."}
{"text":"Bar none. the best shawarma and falafels in the city.   Very nice portions. and the breakfast meal is great!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Picked up 2 Shawarma plates one beef and one chicken both with the Greek salad.  Large portions so fantastic value.   Even though was busy we got our order quickly.  The owner and his staff are running off their feet.   Great job guys.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been 4 times, 3 take outs and our last time we decided to eat in and the food was fantastic every time. We love all the friendly hard workers there and would eat in more than the one time but they are always so full. Make you are hungry because the portions are enormous."}
{"text":"The food here is always consistent and fantastic. Our favourites are the Shish Tawouk Plate or the Falafel.  The shish tawouk does have a little of a wait to grill but its worth it. The chicken is perfectly moist and flavourful. I prefer the donair at Jimmy's. If you haven't tried this place, you definitely need to. There's a wait for a reason. You can call them in advance if you want to come to pick-up the food later."}
{"text":"The hummus here is amazing, and you can buy containers of it. We do not live anywhere near this place but we travel to buy the hummus. The shawarma plates are also very tasty. The food is not oily it is fresh and flavourful and the people who work here are all very friendly."}
{"text":"Unfortunately after coming here I am still looking for a regular Shawrma joint I can go to. The service is great but I can't say the platter was impressive. I got everything of the mix platter because everything needs a chance but it was mediocre, I would give this place another chance but not yet."}
{"text":"Having grown up in the Middle East, I tend to have a bit of a snobbish tongue when it comes to Middle Eastern cuisine. Heard a lot of hype about this place, so had to check it out!   Tried the mix shawarma (chicken + beef) sandwich - meat and ingredients were fresh, but the flavors were lacking. No one flavor stood out ..... it was quite bland. Hummus was good.  Definitely tried better spots in town. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This has to be the best shawarma I've ever tried. Was visiting from Florida and stopped by this charm. There's a hint of cardamom in the shawarma but that's what makes it so special. If I ever visit Calgary again, this is totally on my go to list. Have I mentioned how absolutely amazing it  was?"}
{"text":"Tried this place twice. Once for chicken shawarma and today I had the beef donair platter. Potatoes with garlic cream are very tasty but the rest of it was average. Service is quick and pleasant at the counter but there's limited death and not much parking. It was fairly pricey too."}
{"text":"I love my Donairs being from the east coast.  This place does them right!!  They are amazing and the ingredients are fresh.  The staff are always super friendly and happy to see you!  My favorites obviously are their donair and the handmade falafels. They actually make the falafel balls right in front of you and then cook them.  Yes it means waiting a few extra minutes but it's so worth it.  Their plates are reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  I can't eat an entire plate and end up having leftovers for lunch the next day.  Also while you wait they give you a piece a baklava which is home made and just so wonderful.   It's not the easiest place to find as it's tucked away in the far corner of the strip mall off Harvest Hill Blvd across from TnT but it's such a gem!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, cant say much more than you have to try the food!  Doesnt matter which one. Large servings - amazing flavor. Friendly service. Authentic!"}
{"text":"4.5 if I could.  Taking a little off because the setup is a little complicated, especially when they're busy.    We stopped by at 7:30 pm and just beat a rush of customers that seemed to last a half hour.  The setup is like the Chipotle or Subway of Shawarma, with a variety of options and toppings to choose from.  This is where it can get confusing, especially if they jump right into preparing a standard wrap without asking you what toppings you want -- which is what happened to us.  Instead of restarting our wrap, they used it for the next person in line who had a standard order.  This promoted us to step out of line and wait for that wrap to be completed before restarting on ours.  Confusing and slightly annoying.   The only other gripe I'd have is that the kebabs take 10-15 minutes to prepare.  Understandable because they're fresh and made to order, but half our party was done with their wraps by the time the kebabs were done.  Despite these two issues, I'm still rating this place a four.  Food was excellent, as noted by the constant  stream of customers.  It's also a nice vote of confidence when the customer base predominately matches the ethnicity of the food being prepared.  We ordered a beef donair wrap, chicken shawarma wrap and beef kebab plate.  Everything was delicious.  We'd definitely be regulars if we lived locally."}
{"text":"Best spinning meat ever. \"Shawarma\" means spinning or turning, in case you're not a hipster.  Everything is very clean, fresh and seemed healthy. Perhaps organic? The hummus was fantastic and freshly made. Creamiest, tastiest hummus ever. Organic chick peas, perhaps? It was that good. No, let me amend that statement. It was better than that good. I've had organic hummus that tasted like ass compared to this place. Am I being hyperbolic? Sure. Does this place deserve it? Absolutely. Will they achieve world peace with they're pitas and falafels. Okay, that's going too far. But if any food could end all wars forever, well... you get my point. ;-)"}
{"text":"Great place for Shawarma up in the suburbs of north Calgary. They are open late which is great.  10pm weekdays and 11pm on Saturday.  They offer free baklava samples (not sure how long that will last) every time you go there.  Ingredients they use are fresh and the meats (only tried donair meat) are tasty.  Staff is friendly, not super friendly where they will talk your ear off but they smile and answer nicely when engaged in small-talk."}
{"text":"Food are yummy but expensive a bit ... please cozy and clean ... will visit it again but for regularly due to prices"}
{"text":"My new favourite Shearma Restaurant in NW Calgary. Friendly courteous staff.  Our order was taken promptly. They brought our food to our table very fast. They are well equipped and staffed to handle the busy evening we were there. Definitely coming back for the fresh, flavourful food."}
{"text":"Landed at Calgary airport and was famished so our group decided to come here. There was one table that could seat like 8 ppl, which was really convenient for our group.   I ordered the beef shawarma plate which came with plenty of food. Everything tasted delicious, the beef, the pita bread, hummus. I somehow managed to finish all the food and was absolutely stuffed.   One thing is this place does not offer tap water so you'll have to buy a drink if you're thirsty."}
{"text":"Love love this place! Definitely my go to for shawarma and people that work there are so nice! Can't say I've ever been unimpressed"}
{"text":"It pains me to deduct two stars, it truly does-but with all do respect as a regular customer of this establishment I feel that I should mention some things that have been less than impressive as of late.  I hope the owners take into consideration that I will still be a customer but the comments I'm making are in hopes of correcting things to better your business.  1. Increased prices on several items.  I hate this.  Why lure us in with a quality product then pull this on us? Really? I don't recall if it's a buck or two but it's still an increase and $15 for lunch is NOT reasonable, sorry.    2. No kids meals! Portions are all huge! Maybe consider doing a lunch option of the tawouk platters with one skewer as the current size seems more like a dinner serving, which can also serve as a kids size.  Wraps should also come in small (6 inch pita perhaps?) my kids don't share and don't like the same things so cutting a wrap in half will not appease either of them.   3. I agree with another reviewer about the absence of pita bread with the platters, I mean hummus is technically a dip, and pita is necessary, sorry, at least ask the customer if they want a piece, non Arabs might decline.  I need my bread for my chicken to dip into my hummus-that's how it's done ; )  4. They no longer offer tabouli, this is unacceptable especially since tabouli is considered one of the most traditional middle eastern salads next to fatoush.  They also 86'd the pickled turnips-Boooooo  5. Speaking of fatoush, its not even prepared correctly, it must be prepped fresh and tossed in its dressing prior to serving, they now just squirt some oily substandard dressing on top and its so sad and bland :(  there are hardly any of the staple ingredients in the fatoush, mostly big chunks of lettuce. Please bring back tabouli.  I used frequent this place at least weekly and have brought family and friends and all have loved it, I'm sure I'm not the only one who has done this as business is booming and often there is no seating bc it's so full.  Also, most of the original staff no longer are there, not that I have an issue with the foreign workers program, its great, but the new girls at the counter have no clue what they are doing, sorry. They skimp on the toppings in the sandwich and wrapping them is something else in itself.  The guys that used to make the sandwiches were so nice and would chat with us and serve our food like they were serving family.  The new girls there look like they absolutely detest being there.  Come back original guys/owners and maybe hire staff that have some knowledge in middle eastern food."}
{"text":"It is good but when we order the platter it came with few pieces of beef and chicken and a tone of rice, c'mon ppl let's be a bit more fair!"}
