{"text":"Open 24 hours and at $5.50 a panini, you won't find many spots downtown this accessible, cheap and satisfying. I recommend the spicy chicken. A must for the post-booze eats."}
{"text":"Arrived after midnight into the MTL and wasn't sure if I wanted to call it a night or not.  Got a tip from the front desk at the Sheraton to wrap it up with a panini at Joe's.   It was a great call.   I took in the ambience of his open-air, local hot-spot, soaking in youthful, diverse energy of its patrons.  Within a couple of minutes, some sort of hot chicken sub panini thingy arrived in my paws.   It was exceptionally good grub for that time of night.   The boys behind the counter take pride in their work, and I think that you'll enjoy dropping in too.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Might be the only place downtown where you can get a meal for under $10. Simple, tasty sandwiches made to order and served hot - the menu doesn't list all the fillings in each sandwich but the staff are polite so I'm sure you can ask! (They're pretty efficient, though, so I wouldn't hold up the line with too many questions.)  Tons of options, considering how small the place is - they've got endless beverage options, a huge menu of sandwiches, and almost any side you could ask for. Salads, desserts, soup, chips... the only thing I haven't noticed yet is a green salad.   Definitely a good option if you want a quick, inexpensive meal. You might be lucky enough to get a table, but I'd plan to take my lunch to go in case the place is busy."}
{"text":"An excellent sandwich. Great place if your on the run and need something quick and delicious.  Try the spicy chicken!  They don't take credit, so don't forget cash."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, always open, and staff are great and super patient considering the number of drunk bros / douch nozzels they have to deal with. Better selection of drinks than many depanneurs. The spicy chicken, prosciutto and brie, and  cheese steak are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Aufgrund einer Empfehlung sind wir hin. Vorweg: der Preis ist unschlagbar günstig. Für 2 Panini, einen Quinoa Salat und einen Orangensaft haben wir nur 16 Can-$ gezahlt.  Die Panini waren sehr warm und lecker. Etwas mehr als Männerhandteller großes Baguette. Macht gut satt. Pluspunkt: wenig Käse auf dem vegetarischen Panini mit Grillgemüse. Auch Tofuvariante erhält, was nicht selbstverständlich ist.  Minuspunkt: nur Weißmehlbaguettes und leider alles Einwegverpackungen mit viel Plastik und Alu."}
{"text":"Delicious! Restaurant  is a bit loud and they use a lot of mayo which I'm not a fan of"}
{"text":"Delicious 24 hour joint! Try the Mac and cheese it's absolutely delicious. Their classic chicken sandwich is definitely a hit. I'm also a fan of the philly cheese steak!"}
{"text":"Not worth half the hype. Boyfriend and I bought 3 sandwiches [prociutto and Brie, bbq rib, and spicy chicken (which is apparently a favourite)]   The only decently consumable panini was the BBQ rib. After eating half of the other two I decided to throw them out because it just wasn't that great.   Their only redeeming factor is the fact that the place is open 24h, thus allowing everyone to grab a bite whenever they happen to be hungry.   Avoid"}
{"text":"Un classique! Service rapide. Excellente nourriture et prix décent. Ouvert 24/7. Parfait pour après les bars"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch place downtown with hot paninis, made to order for only 5 bucks including tax! Did I mention this place is open 24 hours? Has to be downtown's best kept secret."}
{"text":"Delicious paninis with bargain prices!  Joe's is just a short walk from our hotel and was recommended by our concierge for a quick grab and go lunch.  My kids enjoyed the mac and cheese - the portion was very large and generous."}
{"text":"Tuna panini was delish but not filling. $5.50 is not thaaaat cheap but considering how friggin expensive food here is... I guess it's like buying 2 bagels from Tim Hortons. Only take it to-go because the place is TINY despite the seemingly large storefront."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had. If you're looking for some good eats in downtown Montreal I would definitely recommend this place. Open 24 hours can't get better than that."}
{"text":"Tasty, always open, extremely reasonable prices. I would like a larger sandwich option. One is not enough and two is too much."}
{"text":"Wow... I am speechless !  Small little panini joint, i went there on a Sunday night so it was quiet but i wouldn't imagine going there on a Saturday or Friday night.. As the other reviews says its very busy during the week end. I don't like packed and busy restaurants, and it must get pretty filled since its right in the middles of downtown near all the bars.  Their panini selection is extensive, all 5$, and you can get a trio for 8$ which is cheaper and much better than Subway or Cultures... And MUCH tastier. They also have a good vegetarian panini menu.  I got a brie and pruscitto panini and my husband had the BBQ Rib panini. Wow what a flavour explosion, much better than any sandwich i had ever had. The BBQ rib was so tender and just nicely coated with sauce. We took a trio, water and cinnamon bun.  They have a pretty good salad and extra bars, which you can get when you take the trio, either chips, salad, soup or bakery. Everything is filling and much more cheaper than other fast sandwich joints i have been. They also have a huge drink selection(4 fridges)   If you aren't in the mood to be in a crowded place don't go during weekend nights, but please try this place whenever you can for a flavour orgy with your taste buds. Its also 24h so you can go whenever you feel like ."}
{"text":"Best panini in Montreal, especially for the price! I come to joes a lot either during breakfast, lunch, dinner or late night, since they are always open. My favorite is the spicy chicken, but I have tried almost all the sandwiches and they are all very good.  They are fast with their service and just a chill laid back atmosphere. Like other yelpers said, the tv could be blasting very loud much vibe and there aren't many seats, but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Cheap , fast and good quality Panini's. Small shop with a hole in the wall feel and a large open door."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwhiches. Its good place to go late night because its open 24 hours. Its not very high end but its a very good tasting snack. I would recommend the spicy chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Always fast service. The paninis are the best I have tasted in Montreal, and I am a huge bread fan! Therefore, Joe's Panini is worth five stars easily."}
{"text":"The music is outrageously loud I'm never going there again. The 5 minutes of waiting for my sandwich were very unpleasant. I can't imagine eating there."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Montréal. Easily. The only downside is that it can get REALLY crowded, also, that makes it difficult to find seats. The place is quite small and somewhat hidden. I recommend it really only if you're going to take a sandwich to go."}
{"text":"wow!  the spicy chicken pannini was fantastic!  BLT was also delicious.  Outstanding take out, but there are also some tables if you're lucky"}
{"text":"Great selection of Panini's for only $5.50 - or make it a trio with a variety of salads or deserts.   The sandwiches are made to order, and they are made with fresh ingredients. The bacon is thick and crunchy just how I like it.   Great place for a quick bite! Great service with a NYC ambiance"}
{"text":"Dope 2 sandwiches 11,50$ i sugger you take 1 vege-burger(delicious even if im not a fan of vege-things) and 1 spicy-chicken with an extra-spicy (hot) after that i was good for 12hours"}
{"text":"Used to work near here and always ordered here for lunch or breakfast or dinner.   I usually get the grilled chicken panini and I've never been disappointed. For a cheap sandwich, you'd expect less but nope, it's actually ridiculously good.   I've also tried their breakfast plate (eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, coffee, etc). It's also pretty good, it reminds me of home actually-- very home style breakfast.   Their Mac and cheese is awesome! The portions are fairly big and it tastes very gourmet and not at all like KD (though I do like Kraft dinner).   They also have a chicken Caesar salad which probably stands in second place with regards to what I order the most. There really isn't anything too special about it. Just tastes like any other chicken Caesar salad you would get at a non-salad based joint. What I like is that instead of being ridiculously overpriced (I'm talking to you Mandy's), it's only a little bit over priced at I think around $7.   I'd probably give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for that one time I bought two pastries (one chocolate croissant and another chocolate type pastry, can't remember what). But the croissant was super stale-- I could taste how old it was-- and the other chocolate thing had already gone bad; When I opened the brown paper bag, all I smelled was disaster. Oh and also, the macaroni salad tastes like nothingness.  But other than that, I love Joe's!"}
{"text":"C'est ici que j'ai dîné aujourd'hui.   L'endroit est situé sur une rue un peu moins passante du centre ville. C'est sûrement la raison des prix si bas!   Le restaurant est minuscule et les fenêtres ont été enlevé pour en faire un endroit presque entièrement ouvert sur la rue. Quelques tables sont disponibles pour ceux qui veulent manger sur place. Pour ceux qui veulent profiter d'un peu de nature, un parc à 3-4 coins de rue fera votre bonheur!  Des paninis à 5.50 sont disponibles en plus d'une dizaine de saveurs (rosbif, thon, oeufs, mais aussi quelques saveurs végétariennes). Pour 9$, vous pouvez avoir un trio avec une des salades (environ 5 sortes) et un breuvage. Quel choix de breuvages! Des cannettes, des jus, des liqueurs, de l'eau, des bouteilles, des cartons... 3 frigo remplis de différents produits! Tout le monde y trouve son bonheur!  Notre commande a été prête en à peine quelques minutes. Très rapide pour 3 paninis!   Il semble que l'endroit soit bien aimé des travailleurs des alentours, quand nous sommes sorties avec notre commande à la main, une file d'une dizaine de personne s'étendait jusque dehors!   J'ai bien aimé.  p.s. à ce qu'on m'a dit, l'endroit est ouvert 24h !"}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious sandwiches.  If you care about cleanliness or are a germaphobe, this is NOT the place for you."}
{"text":"-small and under staffed -not worth the wait in line... panini was average. -good price ...$5 for panini -not enough space inside so you will wait outside and be pushed at the door (when you finally get there) by the people leaving."}
{"text":"American buyers beware!! They claim to not accept any credit or debit cards from the U.S. nor do they account for any currency difference. I gave him $20 (u.s) and got back 1 Canadian dollar for 3 paninis , that cost 19 Canadian dollars. When I questioned him, he said his boss does not believe in exchange rates. My wife was so hungry at the time, we decided to let them take advantage of us."}
{"text":"Came here on a hot summer day for a quick no fuss lunch. All the sandwiches are made on the spot with fresh ingredients. I loved the baguette they used which tasted fresh and had the perfect crunchy outer with a soft interior.   Prices range around the $4-$5 mark for a panini.   The seating area has a mix of outdoor/indoor. They blast much music vibes videos of hip hop and RnB on a tv situated across from the counter where you order. The tables are cheap and plastic and you sit on benches or cafeteria style chairs. This is a no-fuss eating zone and that's exactly the way I like it. There isn't a large amount of seating so you might be hard pressed to find seating on a busy lunch rush. They often have lines during popular meal times.  Overall would come back if I was craving a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Ok, giving it a 5 star maybe too much but their Spicy Chicken Panini was an absolute orgasmic. Maybe it was the alcohol talking so i decided to try it when i am sober. To my surprise it was as good. A definite must try. Am glad my hotel was just 10 min walk."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich... Must go to if you're in Montreal... Quick and easy service... Nice people... Ham and cheese is great... Nice and hot when you eat it... Reasonably priced... only reason it doesn't get a \"5\" is because the sandwich is a little small."}
{"text":"Very good panini, reasonably priced, great location in downtown Montreal but they don't take credit card. We're not used to carrying cash so it's disappointing that Joe's is a cash only place.  We would have came back a few times if they accept credit card."}
{"text":"Arguably the best veggie burger I've ever had. The tomato and bocconcini and greek are pretty good as well. Taste is great no matter the hour."}
{"text":"I landed this place by luck! and am happy about it. They have great sandwiches, and many veggie options too. I tried gingembre sesame tofu and it was awesome!  The staff is pretty friendly too. The place is small but food is good and reasonably priced, also its 24hrs."}
{"text":"Paninis are great and the price is low. Servers are really friendly. Love this place."}
{"text":"I grabbed a quick meal there while doing Christmas shopping; low 'n behold they managed to cram even more variety in this tiny little eatery.  What's still a constant is value for the $."}
{"text":"Subway can't hold a candle to this place!  I was surprised how great their paninis are for $5,50.  High Quality ingredients for the price too."}
{"text":"Great food very cheap but should definitely get a delivery service  Great paninis,salades,sandwiches,deserts etc..."}
{"text":"Les paninis, tout le monde connait les paninis... J'avais donc une idée de ce que j'allais manger. J'ai pris celui au tofu! Agrémenté de laitue, de tomate, etc. L'ensemble m'a plu, mais le hic... c'est que je n'ai pas retrouvé ni le goût du tofu ni sa texture. C'était assez étrange comme tofu et pourtant je suis habitué à ce produit, car je le consomme dans toutes ces formes. Le jour où nous y sommes allées, il y avait des travaux juste en face de Joe's Panini. Dommage pour eux. Cependant, il y a l'avantage d'être placé en plein centre-villet et proche du square Dorchester, par exemple, qui est agréable pour aller se poser manger tranquillement son panini. Quoi qu'il en soit, les prix sont très abordables! Si vous travaillez dans le coin, si vous magasiner en centre-ville, ça peut etre une bonne place pour manger sur le pouce."}
{"text":"J'adore leur sandwich poulet épicé, vaut toujours le déplacement surtout avant d'aller au cinéma juste a côté. j'ai essayé le phillysteak et le meatball...bon sans plus, mais pour une sortie cheap, passé par joe's panini presque toujours ouvert et revient moin cher et bien meilleur que du mcdo!"}
{"text":"4 stars for a panini joint?    Great fresh ingredients, great deserts, a WIDE variety of drinks (even hard to find ones like black cherry soda) and the price is perfect!  DID I MENTION 24h?  Try it out if you feel like eating great food in the middle of downtown for next to nothing!"}
{"text":"Perfect for a Late Night Snack, if the Munchies are kicking in you can't go wrong with Joe's Panini's. BLT with a Pasta Salad and/or some chips, add a Soft Drink of your choice, and for as little as CDN 10 you've got yourself a Meal!"}
{"text":"I've tried many of the sandwiches and they're all good, plus it's open 24 hours so it's perfect as a late-night snack"}
{"text":"Pretty good. 24hours and reasonably priced. Should try the Spicy Chicken Panini (5$) or Spanakopita (2$). Good drunk or hangover food"}
{"text":"Joe's Panini is a little but busy, 24h sandwich joint in the downtown area. An employee told me that spicy chicken is the most popular option, but I'm not a huge fan. I like the BBQ rib. SO GOOD.   Sandwich comes to $5.50 with tax, the trio (which comes with a drink and a side/dessert) is $9. They take debit. Service isn't slow, but it's also not ... immediate. Expect to wait at least a few minutes, maybe up to 10 minutes, for your order to come through. I've always been able to find seating even though there aren't many seats because it seems most people grab and go.  I like this place. I just wish the sandwiches were bigger."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches at very fair prices. You can't go wrong with the spicy chicken panini!"}
{"text":"Great bang for the buck. Delicious grilled sandwiches for pretty cheap, definitely a better alternative to Subway. Oh and they're open ALWAYS."}
{"text":"This place is great. I though it tastes so good because I've only had it after night outs. So, I tried it once during the day and it was not bad. It is exactly what you need after a night out as it's open 24-7, extra star for that. I love the spicy chicken with pesto."}
{"text":"For some reason, they're not really on my radar when it comes to grabbing a late night bite.  The lineups are what kills it for me, it is worth it once there since the prices are very decent and the selection is pretty good.  You can even have salad, at 4 in the morning. It could be the healthiest thing you do all night."}
{"text":"Man, they make good paninis!   It's cheap, always open, and provides fast service too. Conveniently located downtown, it's a hotspot for late night run-ins after an evening out. They have a few tables and seats so it can get somewhat cramped and tight, I find that it's better for take out. My recommendations = Anything chicken! I'm a huge fan of their spicy chicken and their grilled chicken. Can't go wrong with those. If you've got a sweet tooth too, they bake home made treats like brownies, cake, pudding, and so much more.   Joe's Panini can definitely satisfy any appetite. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"A late go to when staying in Montreal. Good prices quality product and good selection. Small and music can be loud but you don't come here to sit in"}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap paninis! We had the Italian and Philly Cheese Steak paninis, they were both delicious and the service and turnaround very fast! Really great location just off a bustling street, the only (minor) downside is it's cash only and the music was really loud. Great for a quick bite to eat or for taking to go."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ Rib trio. Service was quick, prices are very affordable and the panini was good.  Will definitely look to try it out again after a night out downtown."}
{"text":"... tout ce que je peux dire c'est que je ne me fierai plus aux étoiles sur Yelp lol !"}
{"text":"Super let down by this place based on the great reviews they had. We ordered paninis for 4 people and every single order was wrong. One person who is super lactose intolerant had requested no cheese on their panini and their panini arrived loaded with cheese. We also requested the paninis on whole wheat and they showed up on white. Super disappointing. 24 hours is definitely convenient but this place should be a last resort, if at all."}
{"text":"This place is open 24/7 so if it's late and you're hungry and feeling like a sandwich, it's a good place to go. It's somewhat-greasy fast food, so don't be expecting any froufrou gourmet paninis here.  For $7.83 ($9 taxes included) you can get a panini, a drink, and your choice of soup, salad or dessert.   It was approaching midnight, and we wanted a snack so we ordered a trio to share. The guy working at the counter was even nice enough to offer to cut the panini in half for us.   We got the smoked turkey panini, a garden salad and a can of pop. The turkey was deli meat, which was expected. It had cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and a tad too much mayo for my liking. Nonetheless it was good. The salad was romaine lettuce with 1 cherry tomato and 1 slice of cucumber. The dressing came on the side and was oil and balsamic vinegar.   Staff were friendly and efficient.    Not gourmet fare, but good for late night munchies."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, the spicy chicken sandwich is perfection. Every time I visit Montreal from NYC I have to stop in and buy a crap-ton of spicy chicken sandwiches to go."}
{"text":"If this panini shop were located in a mall and was charging $8-$10 for its sandwiches like most nondescript sandwich places found in food courts,  and if it were only open during the day as many cafes that serve this type of food,  then I would be ranking it a 3/5. However,  Joe's gets bumped up to a 4, because 1) a large-size panini sets you back a little over $5 with tax and 2) it's open 24/7!! That alone is amazing, since this is one of the only places in the downtown  bar/clubbing area that's open at all times AND is super cheap. I won't lie, the place looks sketch as hell inside at night,  especially the seating.  Not the cleanest.  And you usually can expect some drama going on between patrons waiting in line,  since they are either hyped up and waiting to go clubbing or they are high as a kite and making a pit-stop to quench the munchies. I turn a blind eye to all this and just feel happy to have this option whenever hunger hits.  The panini itself (I always get the spicy tuna) is pretty tasty and fills me up. And even if it doesn't, eating two won't break the bank. Get in, keep your head down,  get the sandwich and get the heck out. I would even give Joe's a 5/5, but I will admit the  spicy tuna doesn't always sit well with me, but let's be honest, these are not gourmet ingredients. They also sell a couple sides like macaroni  or chickpea salad,  as well as some sweets and  breakfast items like yogurt. The line can be hardcore during lunch hour and on weekends late night."}
{"text":"A true one dollar sign store. 5.50$ paninis, all very delicious. I've tried prosciutto and brie, grilled chicken, spicy sausage, philly cheesesteak, turkey, spicy tuna and spicy chicken. Favorites are spicy sausage and philly cheesesteak. Least favorite is grilled chicken: the meat was too dry. The only downside is that there is very little vegetables in them, which doesn't affect the taste, but just makes me feel guilty.   Usually one panini is enough, but when you're really really hungry, you should get two. They also have cookies for 1$ each. They're not bad, very thin and sweet, should eat with milk (which they also have).  Overall the food and price are worth 3.5 stars. Extra 0.5 for the location, the 24h, and the niceness of the employees. Would love to taste their breakfast options when I get the chance."}
{"text":"Perhaps it's because I'm Italian that I have a biased towards Joe Panini. I grew up eating real authentic paninis from local bakeries in east end Montreal. I have very high expectations when it comes to the quality of the bread, cold cuts, cheese and pickled toppings. Simply put, Joe's panini just doesn't cut it for me. They're sandwiches are ok, decent at most. Nothing to rave about to be honest, everything is pretty basic.   On the plus side, they are open 24/7. Therefore if you're downtown late and hunger strikes, you could always head here."}
{"text":"I stopped by before work for a quick bite. It's very convenient that they're open 24/7. Their trio combo is $9 tax in and includes a panini, pastry/salad, and a drink. The panini isn't super fantastic but it's pretty good for the price. Great value"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. I haven't had a sanwich I didn't like there. The chicken is my favourite with spicy sauce. But others including the vege options have all been solid. And so ridiculously cheap."}
{"text":"I forgot to update my review of this place ! Delicious cheap panini's open 24/7. What's not to like?  Highly recommend this place but don't get the mac and cheese!!!  Also the music is quite loud so when you eat inside you won't be able to talk comfortably."}
{"text":"Enjoyed there veggie panini. We had it on brown bread with and without mayo (I liked with, she liked it without). Good friendly people. Good for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall shop with a street side opening when the weather is nice. Awesome sandwiches menu is French and it may seem intimidating but just say hello and they will speak English. Food is awesome.  Pro tip - coconut water in cans at the top of the cooler in the rear - perfect for thirsty pedestrians!"}
{"text":"Great tasting panini sandwiches. They are open 24/7 and seem to get busier as the day went on. It seems like this is the place to be. The price point may be the reason. For $8 you get a drink, sandwich, desert. I ate here twice during my short visit. Something about that sauce on their hot sandwich that is memorable -  its their top seller what they are known for. If you are looking for something quick and tasty, highly recommend this place. They keep the long lines moving and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Drunk and Hungry and craving for a panini? I always appreciate 24 hour places because Im always hungry at 4am and I dont want breakfast food just yet. I had the sausage panini and to my surprise I really enjoyed it! The sausage was juicy and very flavourful! I love that when I bit into, I was able to see the juices from the sausages and the steam from it on a cold winter night...mmmmm sausageeees. Some drunk club goers suggested for us to try it and I was excited for it was my very first time. Service was decently fast and the wait staff were so friendly. They were funny and witty and really just joked around with a bunch of drunk hungry people. I will definitely be going back to try other items on their menu and I definitely recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. Really good Paninis and reasonably priced. Love the spicy chicken. Just wish the music wasn't so ridiculously loud."}
{"text":"Decent quality at deep-value price point. Get a \"Trio\" combo with sandwich, side, drink (soda, San Pellegrino, etc) for $9 after tax, go for spicy chicken or BBQ rib (I liked the chicken better but tastes/reports vary). A reliable go-to for locals in this area. Would probably go again.  Pro tip: call your order in ahead of time, save yourself a wait - it gets busy."}
{"text":"The food at Joe's was incredibly average. If I wasn't starving at the time, I probably wouldn't have finished the Italian Panini. While you couldn't beat the price (5.50), I asked for no lettuce or mayo, and they still put both on the sandwich. Also, they don't accept American cards, which is a bad move seeing that there are two huge hotels within a block....and because it was the only place I had encountered that didnt accept american cards."}
{"text":"J'ai trouve ce restaurant par accident, mais c'etait un bon accident pour moi! Pendant mon vacation a Montreal, j'y suis allée deux fois! C'est pas tres cher, et il y a beaucoup d'options. J'ai pris un sandwich de fromage, et c'etait tres tres bien - le sauce etait délicieux. Je le recommande pour un vite dejeuner ou diner."}
{"text":"The spicy (grilled) chicken panini with hot sauce is really good but the roast beef panini was disappointing."}
{"text":"Enjoyable. Fairly priced. Would definitely eat here again delicious sandwiches and pastries. Good quality food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Vraiment bon vraiment rapide Le seul mauvais point: la musique est beaucoup trop forte il est impossible de s'entendre parler"}
{"text":"I mean... I think the reason this place has such a rep is because of it's central location to Downtown Montreal and the fact that it's open 24/7. Their sandwiches have good flavour and are relatively cheap (we were able to get 3 sandwiches for under $17.   The \"Philly cheese steak\" sandwiches are very flavourful, while I found the spicy chicken sandwich was not spicy at all and the chicken was a bit on the dry side.   The place blasts their music so no chance to have a convo here... the furniture is run-down but I guess the type of clientele who eat here really don't care about that kind of thing lol The bread is yummy and I would only go back if I was craving something cheap and on the go!"}
{"text":"Great Paninis! Can't go wrong for the price and best part is it's open 24/7. Also the vibe is always good due to the tv playing 90's jams or old movies. Had a fun time watching X-men at 3am with some friends. Recommend the philly cheese steak"}
{"text":"Delicious paninis, great for late night or simply after most restaurants have closed. Solid vegetarian menu. Great deal. Say they won't accept American credit cards, bring cash."}
{"text":"Great Panini's. Stop here and get the grilled chicken. It was awesome."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken sandwich. Crispy bread. Spicy sauce. Chicken.  It's a late night winner."}
{"text":"We had the Spicy Chicken and BBQ Rib panini with a garlic bowtie salad and a chicken noodle soup. Everything was good. The soup was filled with chunks of chicken. Overall it was an excellent meal."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall but gem of Montreal eateries. Their sandwhiches are bomb and cheap. Downside is that there is basically nowhere to sit but it's a great place for sandwhiches on the go!"}
{"text":"Si tu as 40mn à attendre pour manger un sandwich gras surpayé plein de cholestérol alors Joe's Panninis est fait pour toi.  Hier soir j'y suis retourné comme au bon vieux temps et je me fait dire que mon Panninis va être prêt dans 4 ou 5 minutes. 20minutes plus tard j'attendais toujours et il restait encore 3 commandes avant la mienne !!! Ne pouvant plus attendre j'ai du quitter : j'ai perdu mon argent et n'ai pas eu de repas du coup ! Alors là je me suis souvenu pourquoi j'avais arrêté  de fréquenter Joe's il y'a 2 ans alors que j'étais un habitué : parce qu'ils sont lents, lents, lents. Parce que la place est tellement petite que même avec 1 client c'est déjà \"plein à craquer\". Parce que finalement leurs sandwiches ne cassent pas une patte à un canard. Et puis ça pue la vieille saucisse."}
{"text":"There's not really much to say about Joe's Panini other than the fact that the food tasted incredibly average. Maybe it was because I was sober at the time, but everything about my sandwich seemed a little... Off?   I ordered the grilled chicken panini, and while the bread was nicely toasted, the chicken was quite dry and therefore ruined the whole flavor scheme for me, and it tasted kind of bland overall. Normally when I'm extremely hungry as I was then, I would be satisfied with anything to satiate my appetite, but I was overall not impressed.  Props to them for having nicely-sized bottles of Orangina, though."}
{"text":"Tried out their spicy chicken panini and it was great! Flavorful, spicy, crunchy and delicious at $5.50. Definitely going there again if I'm around the block."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite. Food was great for a fair price. Only complaint is that the music was a little too loud."}
{"text":"Joe's Panini is a 24-hour panini shop located off of Drummond.  They offer a variety of paninis, such as the ham and cheese, Philly cheesesteak, Nutella, grilled chicken, etc.  I tried their Salami, which came with a vinaigrette dressing, mayo, tomatoes, shredded lettuce, cheese, and slices of salami.  The bread, you can opt for white or wheat, or even a croissant. I stuck with the regular white, and while it could have been more buttered up and more crispier, it was a cheap and a simple bite to grab.  Service was friendly, and there were some seats inside to enjoy your grub.  Just note that they only accept Canadian credit or cash.  +24-hour panini shop +friendly staff +Canadian credit or cash only"}
{"text":"Un panini au poulet grillé à n'importe quelle heure de la journée.  Joe c'est un service 24h/24h on regrette vraiment qu'ils ne livrent pas!"}
{"text":"A recent discovery while on a 3am quest for food and really happy about it. Their sandwiches are delicious and cheap. Now I can have late night food other than 99-cent pizza & shawarma!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick dinner here today. Went with the promising yelp reviews.  For 9 CAD you get a panini, chips and a drink, which is a pretty good deal. You can also get panini, soup/salad and drink for same price.   I got the spicy chicken panini which was grilled chicken with some kinda hot sauce.   The bread itself is tasty and crunchy and hot!  The place is rather small with 3 to 4 tables and some standing room. You pay at the counter, they accept debit cards but no credit cards. They also have coffee based drinks, croissants, cookies etc.   Best part about Joe's is that it's open 24/7 - so if you're looking for some post partying hunger quenching Joe's your spot."}
{"text":"Serviceable hole in the wall for a quick bite. Looks like a favorite with the local working & college crowd, as it was pretty full over lunch, though most got it to go. Prosciutto and Brie Panini came within 10-12 minutes. A little heavy on the mayonnaise but otherwise a nice inexpensive sandwich."}
{"text":"I am looking for breakfast this morning, this place  Is not pricy , I ordered a spicy chicken , delicious?fantastic music, reasonable price, around 5 dollar."}
{"text":"I went to this Joe's Panini at about 4:00 am Sunday morning after a long Saturday night in Montreal and there was still quite a line up of people.  The line moved pretty quickly though. These guys got it down to a science! I ordered a grilled chicken Panini which came to $6 (including the $0.50 fee for Interac). A real bargain.   I do realize I went at an odd hour but the food was sub par. The chicken was very dry and had minimal toppings.  In short, service and price were great. The food itself knocks it down a notch for me though to a 3 star rating. If you're in a pinch for food and running out of cash and or time, Joe Panini will do but I'll do a bit more searching for something a bit tastier next time..."}
{"text":"Let's roll back to Monday morning where I woke up in the hotel trying to figure where to go for breakfast, travel buddy was already dressed and out the door, heading about a block south to McDonald's...then remembered I had bookmarked Joe's Paninis on Yelp as a place to try out. Arrived at destination, pondered the menu while looking around then finally placed my order.  Philly Cheesesteak panini: Perfect sized baguette bread, toasted to crunchy but not burnt. Steak was beautifully marinated, sliced and cooked, not tough nor chewy. Bell peppers were medium cooked, soft yet has crunch factor. Onions are nicely caramelized and cheese was nicely melted. The combination made the best panini I have ever tasted.   Service was great too. Given it was like 8:30am on a Monday morning. Definitely coming back when in town again."}
{"text":"Stopped in at about 1 am as it was just down the street from our hotel Had the grilled chicken Very tasty, fast and for a great price! Good stuff"}
{"text":"24 hours of goodness.  5.50 for a Philly Cheesesteak, as of 2-27-2015. Now I'm a man who doesn't like onions, but the onions in my sandwich were sweet and succulent. Exactly what I needed for a late-night meal."}
{"text":"I went back again for lunch today and decided to take Alex K suggestion and try the grilled chicken panini. It was great!  I may have to start trying out all of their panini's to see which is the best."}
{"text":"Just a tiny little storefront dishing out fresh and good sandwiches downtown, and a welcome relief from the chains that abound around the mall labyrinth of that area. The trio with a salad is a tasty good deal, I was pleasantly surprised by the light non-goopiness of my little bowl of quinoa and by the pile of veggies on my salami sandwich. The reviews on this little shop won't lead you astray, this is just a friendly place to grab a quick light lunch and get on with your day."}
{"text":"Quick place to grab a lunch... Perfect location, always open...  For 9$, you get a Panini (they have so much choice), a drink and a chips / Salad or Soup. So you can't beat that for sure.  Always with great fresh ingredients, my fav is the Spicy Chicken but love so much the Philly Cheese steak... Much more flavour than other sandwich resto like Subway or Quiznos. And cheaper :) And what about the soup... The chicken soup is Wow... made with real chunk of grilled chicken. Another must in my book.  Joe Panini is a small place, busy and loud but perfect to grab a panini to go :)"}
{"text":"All I have to say is, WOW! After a long night of NYE partying at New City Gas, my starving friends and I decided to pop into Joe's for a quick bite before bed. First thing I did was grab a water to rehydrate from a long night of dancing to house music. The water was crisp, cold, refreshing, just what I needed to start my meal of right.  Next I went to order, this was a big part of my dining experience. Being an American speaking no French I asked the friendly worker for help. He guided me towards the Philly Cheese, and I grateful accepted his suggestion. As my friends and I waited for out panini's to be prepared, I got to hear one of thief stories about him driving out of Montreal to hook up with a girl he met from the club, really spiced up the pre meal anticipation.   Then it happened. \"Philly number ninety three!\" I raced over to grab my sandwich with my stomach growling. I unwrapped the tin foil and got right into it, and all I can say is just WOW. The balanced of the flavones, the streak, the bread, the cheese!  We all are our panini's with pure joy in our hearts for the next 20 minutes. From here we thanked the friendly staff for an incredible meal and continued on to bed.   Upon waking up in the morning and talking about breakfast options there was only one place to go, Joe's. I got my spicy chicken and we headed on our long journey home.   No Montreal trip is complete without a stop at here. Long live Joe's Panini!"}
{"text":"The spicy chicken panini was delicious! Great price and they are open 24/7. The only downfall was when we got there they told us they only took Canadian cards so we had to go get cash. But it was worth going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I randomly chose a breakfast place to grab some food before we hiked up Mount Royal. I decided to come here since I saw that Jennifer K has been here.  We settled on splitting a ham and cheese panini and a chocolate croissant. The ham and cheese panini was nothing to rave about. However, the chocolate croissant was awesome! There was just the right amount of fillings and it wasn't overly sweet. The top of the croissant was perfectly crunchy. It was so good, we had to come back here before we left Montreal just to buy two more chocolate croissant."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get a panini for the price. Opens late for those late night study seshs and their spicy chicken sandwich tastes bombbb"}
{"text":"Very, very good paninis. Had the trio combo for $10, included a salami panini, a drink and some wonderful chicken noodle soup (very spicy). Limited seating, great for a quick lunch though."}
{"text":"I came to Montreal for the Osheaga music festival, leave the festival grounds takes forever and by the time we got back to the hotel in Downtown Montreal it was almost midnight. This place is right up the street from out hotel and I book marked it when looking for places in the area.   I cannot say enough good things about the food. I had the spicy chicken panini, it was under $5 for just the sandwich which is a steal for how great it is. The chicken is definitely good quality and seasoned amazingly. Its actually got a great kick to it not that fake spicy a lot of places have. The panini was filling, I'm sure i could eat 2 but I know I shouldn't. 1 is enough.   The service is fast and friendly. Someone barged in demanding their order faster and the cashier remanded calm and dealt with the situation. Our orders were ready in 5 minutes and we sat there to eat.  Im not sure what others are complaining about but I'll be grabbing 1 or 2 of these for my long bus ride home. If this place ever opens up in the GTA I'll be there all the time. I cant get enough its almost worth the 6 hour drive to Montreal."}
{"text":"Their whole menu is delicious and seriously affordable. I would reccomend their mac&cheese to go! The restaurant is small and they play MTV music on the TV very loudly so I would say order the food to go and enjoy it in a calmer setting. The service is consistently friendly!"}
{"text":"Was in the area on a Saturday morning, running some errands when we felt really hungry. Hubby suggested Joe's Panini and I decided to give it a try.  Had heard a lot about this place. I ordered the veg panini and cheese philly steak panini for my hubster. Service was fairly quick. Both of us loved our panini's."}
{"text":"so the food is pretty good ill say. its pretty much the only place that's open late night and its always PACKED. they typically have very loud rap music playing which I don't mind and the place is always filled with drunks. the spicy chicken panini is my go to for sure. the only reason I am giving 3 stars is because its a bit of a free for all at night. theres people constantly stumbling in and out the doors and cutting the line. even when the place is completely packed people will still stand there shoulder to shoulder and eat their paninis preventing other people from ordering and the staff doesn't/can't really do anything about it. and I know it has nothing to do with this establishment and there isn't really anything they can do about it but I went there 4 times over the weekend and there is a homeless guy who lingers outside and BEGS you to give him one of your sandwiches. literally wont take no for an answer and will follow you all the way to the end of the block begging you to give him a sandwich relentlessly. I think on the fourth night my friend finally gave him like 2 or so dollars to leave us alone because he followed us across the street and we didn't want him following us into our hotel."}
{"text":"cool little nook to sit down and get some junk listening to mtv retro! best thing about Joe's Panini is that it's open 24h and can offer you whatever craving you're having whether its chips, sandwiches, sweets, salads. My fave is the mac and cheese mmm"}
{"text":"Cheap eats, good value. But I just watch two male employees come out of the bathroom without washing their hands... Nasty."}
{"text":"Chicken spicy pannini is one of the best orders you can make in this place. The quality is so great. It is worth even more than 5 dollars. There aren't much space to sit."}
{"text":"I found myself downtown and bought a cheese steak sandwich and it was only OK. The bread was good but the cheese steak felt off, the meat tasted burnt and the cheese was a little on the short side.  I felt somewhat disappointed after reading and getting into the hype for Joe's Panini but I guess I maybe took the wrong sandwich for the economic pricing of the place. I figure I'll re-visit this joint again at some point in the future when I find myself in the area and grab something else and adjust my review at that point."}
{"text":"I Finally got around to trying Joe's Panini after all the good things I had heard. I stopped in for a quick lunch. First off, this is a no frills sandwich and pastry joint open 24 hours and is mainly a take out spot as the restaurant itself is very small (although they have a few tables for seating). The prices are ridiculously cheap as you can see in all the previous reviews and service is quick and efficient, but still friendly to get you fed and on your way ! They have a variety of different Panini's to choose from that you can order on their own or as a trio. I love sandwiches almost as much as I love pizza. So needless to say, I was very excited about this place. I tried their italian Panini which is filled with italian cold cuts, cheese and bruschetta on fresh bread and I can safely say, it hit the spot.  The only thing I didnt like was that I found the music was way too loud, especially that the space is small and is already noisy on its own , it makes it hard to hear the order numbers being called out. But ,aside from that , I am looking forward to going back and trying more of their Panini options since I had so much trouble picking just one when I went , everything sounded so good ! ....and who am I kidding , i'll definitely be trying their pastries too :) ."}
{"text":"Joe's Panini doesn't look like much but it's an excellent option if you are in the downtown area and in need of a quick bite.  It also has the added benefit of being open 24 hours a day.  The only drawback is that since it's small seating is very limited.  Your best bet is to get the trio.  It gets you a sandwich, choice of soup, salad or dessert and canned soft drink for only $9.  The paninis are pretty tasty and they have a decent selection of desserts, salads and soups to choose from should you go for the trio."}
{"text":"The paninis are out of this world and are super affordable. I have tried a bunch of them and they are all equally good. The one problem with this place is that the music is always too loud, to the point where you can't hear the person next to you. Also, I've found that the tables aren't always clean and seem a little grimy. Overall, it has great value and is open 24 hours, which is an extra perk."}
{"text":"With a slogan advertising themselves as the best panini in Montreal, I was hoping for something remarkable. Yes the panini was good, decent selection of sandwiches and sides and it's awesome that they're open 24h, but it remains just good, nothing special.  Best to grab and go, as there's not much seating and this small joint looks rather dreary. Also, super noisy tv or radio blaring 90's hits.  I found the panini quite small so this is ideal as a snack or lunch. For the same price and simplicity of ingredients, I think I'd just prefer getting a 12 inch Subway where I can at least get a bit of zing from the sauce.  There's actually a restaurant in the Eaton Centre food court called \"Panini\" that serves a much more delicious version with garlic mayo, which makes all the difference.  No free wifi, and they don't accept credit cards. Boo."}
{"text":"I arrived late in Montreal.  Almost everything was closed except bars and etc.  I had no interest about nightlife since I was tired and hungry.  Luckily, I found Joe's Panini.  Great tasty cheap paninis!  Much better than the overpriced ones in NYC!  Will visit again if I'm in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Let's get real here kids: there are 2 types of Paninis to eat at Joe's Panini: the Philly cheesesteak and the spicy sausage. Everything else is good, just not as good.  But for 5.50$ a piece, you can't go wrong. Joe's Panini delivers great value for the money."}
{"text":"Great bang for ur buck! I had two philly steaks and can't complain! Something quick on the go for $5? This is it! Much better than subways that's for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch! Affordable too! A good size panini will cost you $5.50 tax IN! You can also get a Trio for $9.00 tax IN! That will get you any panini of your choice, a canned drink or bottle of water, and either a small side salad, soup of the day, a bag of chips, or a cookie.  Lots of options for the panini's:  - spicy chicken  - grilled chicken  - turkey - ham  - tuna or egg salad  - meatball - BBQ rib, etc.  All panini's come automatically with lettuce, cheese, and tomato, so if you do not want any of these toppings on your sandwich - be sure to let them know when you order. Also, they do have brown bread for the panini's but you need to tell them when you order otherwise they will give you white bread by default.   The place is suuuuuper small. It fits about 10 people snugly. If they are busy, there may not be any available places to sit... it is sort of 'that' small.   Very casual environment.   DOES NOT TAKE CREDIT CARD THOUGH!  They only take Interac or cash.   Definitely return-worthy!"}
{"text":"Speedy service, good prices, pretty good food. There's a strangely serious tone to the inside of the place that I wasn't a fan of. They have a variety of menu items beyond just paninis - the mac and cheese, for example, is great. A great place to visit if you're in need a quick, cheap bite."}
{"text":"This little sandwich shop is a lifesaver at 3:00 AM when you're hungry. Open 24 hours, the Panini sandwiches they make are pretty damn good, but the Chicken is by far the best of the bunch.  They also have lots of home made baked goodies like brownies, rice krispy treats, and cake. Pudding too. It's really everything you need if you're just hungry.  It's a little cramped and they always have the TV blasting music videos, but whatever. It's nice to know it's there."}
{"text":"I picked up a chicken panini from here on St. Patty's day. Oh MAN was that ever a good move! We had taken them back to my buddy's apartment, re-warmed them (was rly  cold outside) and had them with a nice stout. You know that happiness you get when you just ate something filling, delicious and healthy? Not like that disgusting bloated feeling you get after downing a row of oreos or scarfing a Big Mac trio. I'm looking forward to the next time I can relive that experience."}
{"text":"It was 3 am on a Saturday.  Hungry and in need for a snack. I was glad to find Joe's Panini using my Yelp App.  Opens 24 hours!  It was just packed inside with hungry post party goers all in a good mood.  My Philly Cheesesteak Panini for around $5 did take awhile to be ready but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"One of the better paninis I have had in Montreal. They're quick, and have a varied selection. While its cash/debit only, they are consistent on food. It's filling and not too much. The place is tiny, so it's a good grab-n-go; waiting for that one person hogging that four person table can be a while."}
{"text":"I had a french course at the YMCA and this was my fav. dinner place during that course. Its very cheap around 5$ for a tasty panini and they have so much veggy options that its just heaven. Just one of those hidden jams, not a 5 stare meal but for a quick snack or to fill in the hole in your stomach this place is more then perfect for the task."}
{"text":"J'adore critiquer les annonces publicitaires, que ça soit à la télé, sur le web, dans les journaux, etc. Et savez-vous laquelle j'aime le moins en ce moment? Toutes celles de Tim Hortons qui parle de ses paninis qui ne sont pas des vrais paninis. Ça n'est pas parce que tu écrases ton sandwich dans un presse-panini que ça en devient un magiquement. Ne-non! Il faut simplement que tu utilises un pain panini (pas du pain en tranche là) et ça peut être servi comme tel ou bien réchauffé. La compagnie qui a été responsable de faire ces pubs là, et de choisir le nom de leurs sandwichs, devrait aller faire un tour à Joe's Panini pour bien comprendre ce que c'est!   On y sert une demi douzaine d'option, allant de extra carnivore à végétalien pour aussi peu que 5,50$, taxes comprises, pour un panini. On y trouve aussi des plats cuisinés à chaque jour comme des pâtes et des salades. Les portions sont vraiment bonnes. Juste assez généreuses sans être trop grosses et les ingrédients sont frais, frais, frais. Probablement parce qu'ils sont un assez haut roulement pour faire passer les bons ingrédients. Le service est bien et si ça prend un peu de temps, c'est simplement parce que réchauffer un panini, ça prend du temps.  L'endroit comme tel par contre est très petit et pas super bien éclairé même avec les grandes fenêtres toutes ouvertes. Je vous suggère plutôt d'y aller pour prendre votre lunch, ou même votre snack post grosse soirée, pour emporter et allez vous installer dans un parc pour le dévorer."}
{"text":"With a bit of time between checking out from the hotel and my departure flight, I needed a nibble. Joe's to the rescue with a hot and toasty panini sandwich. The dude (yes, dude is the right word here) spoke perfect English when I asked him what was good today. The spicy chicken was his recommendation and I grabbed a bottle of water to go with it.  And then I went to my wallet. Oops - no Canadian cash left. No worries, he let me pay with American. Your mileage may vary.  The sandwich was excellent. The right size and with a good amount of chicken and spiciness.  On the minus side of the equation, there was no wifi in the place and the table where I sat was sticky. Minor details."}
{"text":"A really good place for a cheap lunch. We pay only 11$ for two paninis ! The grilled chicken is awesome with a tasty sauce. The music is fancy and fun : ten minutes to eat and relax."}
{"text":"A total of 5,50$ taxes included for a panini! What a great deal for downtown Montreal. Open 24/7 this place offers a big variety of panini. You can turn your order into a combo for an extra 2$. Service is fast and efficient. I tried the grilled chicken panini and enjoyed it a lot! I also asked them to make mine hot and spicy. Sooo good! I can easily see myself trying all their panini and going there once a week:)"}
{"text":"Great service you walk in and get served right away. There are a lot of choices of sandwiches, drinks, salads, and sides. I ordered and got my food very quickly. The lamb gyro was amazing they made it with an oven roasted bread and the sauce was amazing. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great, fast sandwich place."}
