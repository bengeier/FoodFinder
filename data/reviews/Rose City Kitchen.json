{"text":"I first tried Rose City Kitchen last year and ordered the Original box. It was amazing, and portions were decent. Recently I've found that the portions have gotten smaller, making it quite expensive for what you get. Today I ordered a kale salad with chicken and there's about half a cup of water at the bottom of the box. Quality has definitely gone down. Don't think I'll be coming back again. Sad."}
{"text":"I just bit into a staple in my RCK Original box. Sorry but I won't be returning to RCK!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Fresh ingredients, lots of taste, my favorite is the egyptian sandwich with shawarma chicken.... so yummy ! Lots of food for the price too ( especially for the boxes)"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I went with a few friends; we each got something different and each loved our meal.  Fresh ingredients, sizable portions, delicious combinations, and quick, friendly service. I wish this place was closer to me!   I would have liked salt on the table, (I add salt to pretty much everything I eat; the seasoning was fine was for everyone else), but the boys behind the counter gave me their seasoned salt which was even better."}
{"text":"Ordered the Moroccan box with Falafel. 3 small falafel balls with some rice, a few cherry tomatoes and a handful of chick peas. Not too impressive for $10. A previous reviewer was right - Villa Medina in the Scotia food court is higher quality and you get way more food. Maybe the other boxes are better but I wouldn't return based on what I had."}
{"text":"The 15-seat intimate \"snack bar\" style space was imaged by Toronto based design firm, Salt&Pepper, and blends minimalism, Mediterranean authenticity and subtle sex appeal.  With the kitchen fully exposed, diners popping in for a healthy lunch or supper can watch as meat is grilled, pita is baked in their mini wood oven and their sandwiches are assembled with to order.  During the summer months, guests will have the opportunity to nab one of the 10 seats outside if they're not looking to rush back to work or home.   As previously alluded by the location-referenced name, RCK's menu is inspired by the trading and cultural junction of the Mediterranean region. Everything (including the stone-oven baked pita breads) is prepared in house, with gluten free varieties in the works!  The offerings includes both familiar Middle-Eastern favourites  (like hummus, falafel, and house made pickles), as well as playful culturally inspired items like their cherry harissa, Tabouli poutine, and rose infused hot sauce). Another interesting element that sets RCK apart from the city's various other Mediterranean eateries is that they won't be using any traditional spits - a choice the team made to safeguard against food safety and hygiene concerns.  I popped by for a little preview of the goods, so here's a little sneak peak at what you might be sinking your teeth into when you visit RCK.  Assorted Pita Sandwiches  Though it was definitely hard to choose, my favourite sandwich of the bunch was probably the Moroccan which had a really addictive kick from the Harissa and a delicate sweetness from the apricots.  Coming in close second was the Egyptian because the sweet caramelized eggplant just melted like satin on my mouth. Add a little of RCK's rose scented hot sauce and holy hell, it's good. Overall, though, I really liked that each sandwich was so different in flavour profile and customizable with chicken, steak, falafel, or halloumi cheese so that you could get something very different every time. Even better was that the size (1/2 a pita) made it easy to mix and match to try a few without committing to intently on just one protein or base.  Falafel (Approx. $0.50 each)  Some of the absolute best falafel I've had in this city. Super crunchy on the outside with a nice meaty texture within and a lot of great aromatic flavour- I really got the cinnamon and cumin combination coming through and that made me wiggle in excitement.  RCK Poutine ($5-6, plus choice to add on Falafel, Chicken or Beef) Tabouli, Hummus, and Shredded Halloumi Cheese  A very creative and delicious take on the poutine, and what's not to like? I love the combination of the crispy fries, the salty cheese, the tangy hummus and the herbaceous grain salad. Somehow I feel healthy eating this basket of deep fried goodies?  Humus   Exactly how I like it. Super smooth with a nice balance of lemon, sesame and garlic."}
{"text":"I had a very mixed experience here. The food was delicious, and the service was good enough, but my lunch here was extremely uncomfortable. The owner thought that it would be appropriate to yell viciously at her staff across the restaurant about something entirely unrelated to work. Everyone who was in Rose City at the time stopped eating and looked around awkwardly; the entire mood was killed. I've worked for people like that before so I don't think I'll be returning to support it."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost! Whether its the rude female staff, their infamous raw chicken (or burnt overcooked chicken at times) or cancelled order due to missing ingredients(this happens alot!) there always seem to be something wrong with your order in this location."}
{"text":"Everything is so good. The Moroccan salad, the RCK poutine and the Egyptian sandwich were my favourites.  The seating arrangements are not the best if you suffer of a bad back or generally have a hard time sitting on high chairs."}
{"text":"My first experience my friend and I came in and felt the uncomfortable stare of the two owners sitting at one of the tables -- so much so that we both said something about it. As a few more customers walked in their stares faded. Once we had our food, my friend and I along with other guests of RCK were SHOCKED at the woman who owns it yelling at her staff from across the restaurant! It went on the entire time that we were eating our meal. The owner even seemed to think we were into it, looking over at us and smiling as she was belittling the girl working in the kitchen. This was obviously something that happened often. The food was pretty good though.  Today I came in for my second time to RCK. I had not planned on returning after my first experience, however something told me to give it another shot since they may have worked out some of their bumps. I stood at the counter, the sole customer in the place, and when I wasn't greeted I assumed they were waiting for me to say something. I began ordering and was interrupted by the girl in the kitchen who said \"Just give us a minute, we have a really big order here.\" I said \"Oh, I can see that! Sorry I wasn't paying attention.\" She didn't say anything back. I used the toilet came back, still waiting, still the only customer in there. Finally she sent the guy in training to take my order and he was polite. She was extremely rude.   Then the kicker--I decided to eat my food on the patio because it was uncomfortably hot inside, and I found that I had absolutely no fallaffel in my pita. I brought it back in and quietly let her know, she grabbed it through it out and made me a new one. No apology, it was rude.   TLDR: They're rude, the staff is rude, the owners are rude, there's an absolutely terrible energy in this place."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place when they first announced they'd be opening a location on Toronto St. But sad to say I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the RCK original with steak. I did like that they have an option where you can sub the rice for kale. But the meat was so charred that all you could taste was burnt meat.   I will give Rose City one last try, this location opened fairly recently and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. But I'll be staying away from the steak and getting chicken or beef."}
{"text":"After anticipating the opening at their new location at 36 Toronto Street, I have had the opportunity to try their food during their opening week.  While enthusiastic, the execution of their menu needs time and refinement.  I had a latte and a drip coffee from their Clockwork Coffee counter in the store, and a box chicken lunch with the Lebanese twist to it.     First, the meal.  For exactly $10 I receive a 6 inch square box, 40% filled with rice, a few beans, and shredded lettuce.  Almost an after thought, there were \"almost\" three, three inch by half inch strips of chicken.  The flavours were pleasant, but for $10, I expect to be served more than what amounted to rice,  shredded lettuce, and a garnish of chicken.   I'm not sure if this is just opening week jitters, but it's almost as if they started with a good idea, and lost touch with who their clientele are.  At this location, it's financial district employees looking for a full lunch and an excellent coffee and a good price.  Ahh yes....and then there is the coffee....  Their coffee counter is set up nicely, with attentive staff and locally sourced baked goods, similar to the dozen or so high end coffee shops within a 5 minute walk in the area.  Sadly, they only offer one size of coffee (what could be best described as a Starbucks 'tall\" -[that's small]), but at seriously premium prices.  The modest latte was approx. $4.50, or about the same price as the next size up at Starbucks.  This would be fine if the coffee was outstanding, but neither the latte, nor the drip coffee  (on two separate days, to be completely fair) had any discernible coffee flavour.  No roasted bean medium roast aftertaste.  Nothing. The latte tasted like warm, brown milk.  People in this area know their coffee and demand the good stuff - unless they re-work this one, it's going to be a short lived experiment.  With this being said, I want them to succeed.  I really do.  The core idea is sound (with the exception of the pre-packaged juice bar, which is located 50 feet from .....a fresh made-while-you-wait competing juice bar - not sure who thought this one would be a good addition), but until the execution catches up to what others are offering for the same or less money, once the honeymoon period ends, I can see the masses going to the multitude of alternatives, literally on the same block.  All the best and I hope they can make it great.  (as a curious side note - as I work in the same building, it was more than a little odd to see them hold a PRIVATE grand opening bash last week, only to open their doors quietly to the public this week.  One would have thought that they would embrace the public and try to bring them on board with the new venture, rather than shut them out.  It just doesn't make marketing sense in my opinion.)"}
{"text":"Sandwich was good but my one major complaint has to do with the fries. This place does not offer you any condiments on the house for fries - typically you can at the very least get vinegar or ketchup, and sometimes even mayo. Not here. They actually expect you to shell out an additional $2.00 for a dipping sauce after paying $3.00 for plain fries. That's ridiculous and pretentious. When I asked if they have ketchup, I got such a patronizing response - \"We don't do ketchup here. You can buy Harissa sauce.\" Oh please. YOU ARE A SNACK SPOT. Give the public the option! I hate places that think they have some elevated cuisine and that are above \"pedestrian\" things like ketchup or \"chocolate desserts\" (Farmhouse Tavern, I'm looking at our. You are in toronto. Even in Greece they give you ketchup when you order a side of fries with your gyro."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is slow as hell, waited 30 minutes for a lunch box, staffs are all over the place, mixing up orders and it looks like the system is not working properly at all...will be back ...in another few months to give them another chance"}
{"text":"Stopped by a couple weeks ago. The food tasted great. Good pairings. Had the Moroccan falafel in a pita. Excellent. The hot sauce on the side is a must. It's homemade and delicious.   The only thing I would like to see, would be slightly larger portions as I had to go back and get another one. Though I should be complaining because that one was pretty darn tasty too."}
{"text":"For some reason this place is getting a lot of press, it doesn't live up to middle eastern food I am use to although it seems to be a trendy new place competing with nearby burger priest and other smaller fast foods joints. I had the Moroccan with Chicken and Egyptian with chicken - both seemed fresh but lacked any taste to get hooked on. The pitas are quite small so its recommended that two are bought for a full meal (recommended by them). So a full meal cost is approximately the average price of $10 with drink. The pita sizes reminded me of Shawarma Empire in Scarborough which I highly recommend for their price and taste although its not in the vicinity. The service was quick and the girl working the counter was very friendly. The excitement I had heading over to the place didn't last."}
{"text":"I've visited this place on two occasions and was disappointed both times. The food isn't something that leaves you craving more. Although they are reasonably priced I don't think I will be returning.  The lady that owns the store should avoid yelling at her staff in front of a line of customers."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the Moroccan pita with chicken.  Delicious! Portion was small but it was only $5 so that's to be expected.  Will be back to try the other options"}
{"text":"They're right about needing two sandwiches to fill you up, but that just means you get two chance to taste some great, fresh flavours. Eating two pitas here with a quick soda was about $15, if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"Great place in Downtown Core for a quick, filling, and delicious lunch! I ordered the Moroccan (because I simply love couscous) and got it with steak on the recommendation of the server. Glad I got steak instead of the chicken, which I hear is a little bland. The harissa was extremely flavorful yet not overpowering. My favorite part was the flavored brown rice which was a tsunami of spices in my mouth. I would recommend the small box which is more than enough for one person. I'd 100% go back here and try some of the other boxes."}
{"text":"Been back several times (one being a Yelp party), and Rose City has been consistantly good. My favourite time is at lunch for a quick sandwich. Egyptian falafel! That's worldwide. Fastfood isn't horrible at Rose City...it's quite pleasant, actually! Also, lunch is $4.50."}
{"text":"The employees need to upgrade their hygiene + sanitary standards. I have ordered half sandwich and one of the male stuff picked up pita with his dirty hand, he also looked like he have not taken shower for last 3 days, the lettuce was rotten and the chicken was burned."}
{"text":"Came here for clockwork coffee, which shares the same space, and the people behind the bar were super friendly in educating us about pour over coffee. They were great at telling us how it was and explaining the finer details of the process.   But it is pretty pricey for what you get and the coffee is good, but not amazing. I personally would not go back."}
{"text":"Not the best quick-dine-in kitchens on queen street. I call it quick-dine-in because of the very poor decor and layout. It feels like youre sitting in underfunded public high school cafeteria.   Its pretty pricey so I dont know why it only has a one $ sign on the yelp page and not two $$! Also the menu layout is not as straightforward at first youll most likely have to ask for help.  The food is mediocre. The kale salad sounds interesting but once you try it in real life youll notice that most of the ingredients in it are browning, old and dry. The falafel sandwich i ordered was literally a quarter of the size of a regular pita. I finished it in 2 and a half bites. Also I had to get it redone because they made it with pickles when I very specifically asked TWICE to ommit them. Also consider the fact that it was during daytime and we were the only customers ordering, so its not like they were swamped with orders that they forgot about my custom order.  Wouldnt recommend or visit again."}
{"text":"I got the RCK original with chicken as they were out of falafel. I thought the food was just okay. The flavored went well together but it wasn't the best I've ever had. The chicken was cooked well, not juicy but not dry like a lot of fast food places downtown, there is good flavor.   I got the small box - I thought the price was reasonable considering location and portion size. It was filling and balanced with a salad, fries and some chicken for protein."}
{"text":"I had the RCK falafel, and I was under-impressed.  The toppings were delicious, fresh and tasty, with an excellent mixture of spices.   But, the actual falafel balls were sub-par, with no taste and over deep-fried. Basically, they tasted like a deep-fried nothing."}
{"text":"Been here twice.   First time I ordered the pita chips and dip. They just cut up a pita, threw it in the deep fryer and bagged it -- sopping wet with grease. Disgusting.   Second time I ordered the RCK Original half-pita sandwich with chicken. They sloppily put it in a bag and handed it to me with grease, sauce and parsley bits all on the outside of it. Inside the bag the pita contents  had all come out of it. The whole thing was a mess."}
{"text":"I had the Egyptian with chicken. Very flavourful and loved the eggplant. Pleasantly surprised by the char on the chicken! A good $10 boxed lunch, very hearty and filling."}
{"text":"Came for the light supper and ordered the Moroccan half sandwich with chicken. Overall, the flavour was amazing; unfortunately, my chicken bits were greatly charred and burnt. It felt like I was eating charcoal. My friend ordered the RCK poutine and appeared to enjoy it, though she couldn't finish it because it was too large! An interesting experience, though I will not go out of my way to try this again."}
{"text":"Ask me 4 months ago and this would have been a 4 star review.  This location seems to have nose-dived.  Staff are flustered and not trained properly, no matter what I order it comes out wrong or not cooked properly.  I love a lot of things on the menu but it's frustrating when they are made differently every time you order them. I once ordered the RCK Poutine, to my surprise...someone forgot the cheese.  I'm giving up for a few weeks. Will try again when they've got themselves sorted out."}
{"text":"lived in the area for over 20 years and have seen alot of changes ... as for this new change im not impressed at all.... bons submarine has been in this location for over 35 years... the big fish couldent even cut it for 2 years and now we have rose city kitchen.....the portions are very small and it seems like the kitchen staff is very clueless.. waited over 10 minutes for my food and the cashier was pretty rude seemed like she was having a bad day.....if the owners of bons submarine read this just want to say everyone misses u guys and ur fries and gravy the neighbourhood has never been the same since u guys left... RCK is simply for the bouts"}
{"text":"I had decent hopes from Rose City since they were   able to open a second location here but alas, I was supremely underwhelmed with my order. A large Egyptian style halloumi box came out to $12 and it was nothing as I expected (not having seen or read any reviews beforehand). We've all encountered the issue where restaurants try to fancy up their menu by literally listing out each item, only for you to realize what they're actually serving, but here it was way too minimalist. It was described as eggplant / cabbage / red onion / chickpeas / garlic oil / dates / lemon juice -- unfortunately I couldn't tell how each item was prepared and was not expecting cold eggplant semi mashed sweetened with dates (date syrup maybe?), cherry tomatoes and corn of all things. There was no discernible dressing aside from the DIY lemon juice (aka wedge), and what might have been garlic oil to help lubricate, you couldn't taste the flavour of it at all. The halloumi was extremely salty but in small nibbles balanced out the relatively bland taste of the rest of the box. Brown rice helped to bulk out the meal so at the very least $12 got me full, if not satisfied. Agreed with the other reviewer in that I can take my money to the Villa Medina and be substantially happier with my middle eastern meal."}
{"text":"Just had my first visit to RCK. I had the Moroccan Falafel and the Original RCK Chicken and they were both so delicious, I think I may become a daily visitor. It's may be cheap and fast food, but it it's really fast gourmet food."}
{"text":"I really like this place. My favorite is RCK Original. Why 4 stars? Hmm... They screwed up my order a few times;)"}
{"text":"A new, small (15 seat) middle eastern type restaurant  in Queen West.  Looking at the menu, I could see that it had both authentic and fusion elements.  It is definitely not your average falafel/pita joint.   Visited around lunch & the line up was to the door so there was a bit of a wait to order.    Very interesting spin to the poutine dish & love the hot stone oven used to make onsite fresh pita pockets.  Make sure to give their house sauces a try."}
{"text":"I've been on a Middle Eastern Food kick lately and it seems like there are a lot of interesting options , among them Rose City Kitchen. I had the Lebanese Box , with kebab, hummus, those little pickled things and rice.   It was very good and fresh tasting. Only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the portion size. Seemed like the box wasn't that full. Maybe o just got an off box. Next time I will opt for the $1 for an extra topping."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! I cannot wait to tell you all about the dinner I just had at Rose City Kitchen. IT WAS. HANDS DOWN. ONE OF THE WORST FOOD EXPERIENCES I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  My expectations were high but literally every single aspect of Rose City Kitchen was subpar. I'd like to chalk most of the issues up to growing pains seeing as the restaurant only opened this week but honestly some of the hoops we had to jump through just to eat were ludicrous and easily avoidable.  But needn't you worry, I will gladly back up all my vitriol with the full story of what I experienced tonight and the cold hard facts that lay within.  A friend and I decided to go to RCK early this morning as we had both read strong write-ups about the food they were serving up. We decided to meet at 6:30 and hoped that there would not be a crowd seeing as this place has gotten a ton of press since day 1 (which I believe was Monday).  I arrived slightly early so I decided to use the washroom before my friend arrived. After searching for the washroom, which is both hidden from sight and unmarked (what a fun game!) I walked in, handled my business, washed my hands and used some of the complimentary paper towel to dry off. I then went to throw out the paper towel annnnddddd BIG TWIST...no garbage can. I walked out of the washroom, paper towel in hand and threw it out in a garbage in the middle of the restaurant.  Shortly after this my friend arrived (I don't hold this against RCK nor do I hold it against her. She is a constant disappointment and I have grown to expect nothing of her). Seeing as we are functional human beings and there was no line we walked to the counter to order. Here's how the next 6 minutes played out:  Minute 1: We decide what we're going to order. Minute 2: Watch 3 staff members make orders while 2 other \"staff\" do nothing.  Minutes 3-4: Make subtle gestures and awkward eye contact with staff in a futile attempt to order. Minute 5: Discuss the merits of going to Banh Mi Boys.  Minute 6: We're asked if we have ordered and politely reply \"Nope\". Our response must not have been clear because the woman continued to make other orders before looking up again and saying \"OH! You said no!\"  After waiting the totally *normal* 6 minutes to place an order my friend ordered the Egyptian Falafel.  I quietly thought in my head, \"that sounds tasty\". The woman taking our ordered quietly thought out loud, \"we're all out of falafel\". After she heard this (and I heard her heart break) she ordered the Egyptian with chicken and the Moroccan with steak. I then ordered my RCK with steak and a Greek with chicken. I would have ordered a drink but I'm not sure if they sell these \"creature comforts\".  We got our food surprisingly quickly and then offered to pay for it as we were never prompted to do so earlier. Before eating I marvelled at how nice it was to pay two dollars extra for two pitas that were each roughly a quarter of the size of a single pita anywhere else in Toronto.  The food itself was forgettable. The meat was cold. This may have been done with purpose as we had previously seen it sitting under what we assumed was a heat lamp. Looking back on the situation these lights may not have been heat lamps but may have been used instead to send a statement to the customer. That statement being, \"Yes! We have food!\". The \"steak\" in my second pita was overcooked to the point where I was not sure if it was steak or ground beef. Once again, this may have been done with purpose. The purpose being to send a statement. That statement being, \"Yes! We have terrible food to match our terrible service\".  We finished up, threw out our trash, left and continued to discuss the finer things in life such as Bahn Mi Boys.  I'm giving it two stars because at least I wasn't spat on at any point. If you can believe it I don't see myself going back to RCK. However, I will say this...  At the end of the day I was satisfied. Specifically after I walked out of RCK, went a few doors down and had a Bao.  P.S. Completely unrelated but does anyone remember about ten years ago when this space housed the best hole in the wall sub joint in the city?"}
{"text":"So my pal and I went around 6:30pm this evening for what I think was the second day open. It was half empty, does not bode well for an establishment which has just opened after a lengthy implementation, has had a BlogTO review written about it, and a fair amount of other press. I myself was JACKED up about it. A falafel place in my residential area which isn't Nora?! Fantastic.   First issue: they were out of falafel. Also out of tabouli. Took me a while to become aware of this fact, because my friend and I STOOD AT THE COUNTER, literally in front of the unsmiling, visibly tense staff, for over five minutes before someone noticed we were there and wanted to order. I assumed one of the food preppers who had pink hair would have a vibrant, engaging personality to match, but I was proven otherwise. I had made eye contact with several of the staff, including two men who were doing nothing, standing behind a prep counter. Our ire rose, and we quietly debated going somewhere else for dinner, before finally being acknowledged by a woman who was nearly as apathetic as she was curt. We also heard the staff mention that they were there for extended periods of time already - and I just thought yeah, that's what working at a new restaurant entails.   So I ordered the Egyptian with chicken as my protein choice and the Moroccan with \"steak\". To call the steak \"steak\" is a slap in the face to all the cows who toil diligently to provide us with steak. It's something else - something that isn't steak. Maybe ground meat? Hard to tell. The flavours weren't anything special, and certainly not worth nearly $10 for two small half-pitas. Was the meat supposed to be hot? I was too short to see beyond the counter, but my friend insisted there were heat lamps. Maybe it was cold because AFTER they placed my meal on the counter, I paid for it (though I was not directed on when to do so). I could have been given the option to pay well before being served. The process clearly has some flaws. Anyway.   If you're going to charge that much for that size of anything, you'd better really bring on the service and ambiance. Just because you're a potential contender against the establishments in and around Burger Corner doesn't mean you can charge outrageous prices. Also, not once were we asked how our dinner was, or to enjoy our food, or to come back soon, or to say something nice on Yelp -- nothin'.   I'm not a \"big\" girl, but not lithe or willowy either. I've \"got dat ass\" as my significant other has mentioned. I will not be visiting this establishment again in the hopes of maintaining this voluptuous temple. We went to trusty ol' Banh Mi Boys immediately after, where my dining partner inhaled two steamed bao. He will also be posting his Yelp review this evening and I assume it will be written in a similar vein. I've posted pictures of the two diminutive pitas, and also an action shot of my friend enjoying the second part of his dinner, which was infinitely more satisfying than the first."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, easy menu, tasty food!  $10 meal combo of a half pita, drink and fries or kale salad is a great deal. You can pick a meat and style of your choice for the pita, and vintage coke bottles! Fries were delicious and plentiful. Alternatively you can get however many half pitas ($5) and sides ($3-4) of your choice! Humus that came with my baked pita chips & dip side was great. You can also get bowls instead of pitas ($9).   Food came out decently fast, with good service.  RCK sauce is a total win (not spicy). Fresh tasting and flavorful! They also have \"Rose Petal hot sauce\". Nice to see a place with both hot and not house sauces!  Was wondering why \"Rose City\", and learned its named after Petra, Jordan!   Would go again for quick, cheap and light but tasty food."}
{"text":"My office is across the street from this location so I welcomed the addition of a new lunch spot to the area.  Opening week I ventured in and ordered the Moroccan & Lebanese sandwiches.  I wasn't too terribly impressed with either of the sandwiches--both heavy on lettuce, parsley and very little else.  I chalked it up to opening week twitches and decided to try a second visit a month later.  Ordered the RCK sandwich and was disappointed to find nothing has changed.  Sandwich was 99% lettuce, parsley and a few carrot sticks I managed to count 4 tiny slivers of chicken and a smear of hummus.  Pita bread was fresh but the sandwich overall had a gritty texture--I couldn't make out where the grit was coming from but it felt like I was chewing either sand or glass.  At this point I threw away the remainder of the sandwich.  I will give them one more try in a few weeks time--perhaps try something different on the menu and see if there is any improvement."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Rose City Kitchen since it opened. A million years later, I set up a meeting over dinner at this small, snack-centric place.   The restaurant was quite open considering it's little space. Only room for around 20 people to dine in comfortably, it didn't feel stuffy. Let it be known that I went around 8pm on a Thursday, 4 of us + 2 others occupied the room, so by no means did i experience a busy or full restaurant. That could be another story. The outside narrow patio was quite inviting too.  Anyways, we ordered an array of sandwiches (pita) with different proteins and falafel. Salad as well. The pitas were slightly larger than Taco Bell taco sized (just a size comparison, nothing else), filled enough with a \"style\" of your choice (like the Morracan, The Egyptian,  The RCK, etc.) And then protein of your choice (chicken, steak, falafel, cheese, etc.).  I liked the idea, its like a build-your-own-pita concept with pre-made bases. For $4 - $5 you get your own creation. I really liked my combinations (RCK with the recommended  falafel, and the Egyptian with steak).   Although the flavours were good, I felt that consistency was off. I had 2 pieces of steak in my pita, while my buddy had several, same pita, same style. The RCK advertised fries in the pita- we didn't get them in all 3 of our orders. If this happened with me, I'm sure it happens occasionally with other orders especially during busier times. Which makes you appreciate the food less, knowing that. The wait time was also relatively long, given the snack, eat-n-go or take-out nature of the food. We waited a good 8 minutes after ordering, which is not a lot of time, but diminishes the idea of the restaurant when it takes that amount of time to stuff pitas and make a salad.   Overall, the service was nice and helpful but on the slower side. The space was nice, with a quaint patio. The food was good but was inconsistent, that's a pretty big problem. The prices are fair, but after 2 pitas I was still hungry. I get it, I could have ordered more food, but I didn't want to anymore taking all things in consideration."}
{"text":"Disappointing :( Moroccan box was tasteless. Rice and couscous mix is really odd too."}
{"text":"Summary: Meh. Skip Rose City, go to IQ instead. They serve much better quality food.  What I ordered: the Moroccan box with falafel. It came with couscous and a variety of vegetables.   Price: $10 for the large box  Quality: The falafel tasted good. It was crisp on the outside and moist and tasty in the inside. All other ingredients were bland. Overall disappointed.  Ambiance: quick downtown style, good ambiance for a Friday lunch"}
{"text":"Just stopped into Rose City Kitchen for a quick bite to eat on my lunch break, and am I ever happy I did. Being a first timer, the staff happily answered all my questions and helped guide my order appropriately. I was looking for a bit of a lighter option and was able to order the Egyptian box (eggplant, red onion, chickpeas, cabbage, dates, lemon juice, garlic oil) over kale instead of rice! Great for what I was looking for. I was advised that the Egyptian wasn't as popular as some of their other boxes, however, I stilled loved it! I would definitely return here as it was fast service but more importantly the food was great. Thanks Rose City :)"}
{"text":"Given some of the glowing reviews of the other Rose City Kitchen location on Queen St, I was expecting a similar experience at this Toronto St location. Sadly, that was not the case. I ordered the RCK original box lunch with STEAK for $10. Not only was the steak really just ground-up hamburger meat, but it was burnt so bad that you couldn't tell it apart from a lump of charcoal. I can't imagine it was the owner/chef that prepared the food and assume it was just an un-trained new employee that has absolutely no common sense whatsoever. Dude, if you wouldn't eat a lump of charcoal yourself, then don't serve it!   The rest of the meal was barely tolerable. Bland rice, soggy wet fries, and the rose sauce that everyone talks about wasn't that special.   I felt sick after eating some of the burnt meat that I ended up throwing out half the box.   For this price, I would much rather go to Villa Madina in the nearby Scotia food court for Mediterranean fast-food. Bigger quantity, better taste, and the meat is actually edible!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like RCK, I really did. The Greek pita that I had, however, was so small. SO small. Like, bite-size. For $5. $3, on the other hand, will get you a massive box of half-cooked fries. Which is fine, but I seriously thought my meal was in the box. Instead the box was full of fries, and on top was a tiny bag with the pita. And if there was halloumi in it, I couldn't even tell."}
{"text":"As always, I like to review individual items and in the last week I've been back to this place 3 times for the Egyptian sandwich so I'd say it's a winner.   I love eggplant and that chickpea, eggplant mix is delicious.  I've tried the chicken, steak & falafel. All were tasty and their fresh made pita is addictive!  Oh and definitely try their hot sauce too!  It's nice to see this new, fresh, snack type food in Toronto. I'm out all the time and like having food options that are less in quantity and price than a sit down meal and better for me than McDonalds.   I'm not sure what all the other reviews are going on about but when I went they had only been open 3 weeks so I'd say give it a try, maybe it was first month jitters but at $3-4 a sandwich, it might be better to try for yourself. :)"}
{"text":"I love their RCK box! The small lunch box is a good lunch portion."}
{"text":"The vibe: A clean, sunny and brand-spankin' new lunch joint along the busy Queen West strip.   The food: It's all about pita sandwiches here! You can choose from the Original, Greek, Egyptian, Moroccan and one more that I'm forgetting...Oops! Anyway, you can choose your protein, falafel, chicken, or one more that I'm forgetting. See the pattern here? The sandwiches are quite small so it's recommended that you get 2 if you're hungry, 3 if you're starving and 1 if you're nuts. Or just feeling snacky. The pitas are delicious and fresh, but I wish they were a bit saucier. I like loads of sauce.  My go to meal: I tried the Egyptian and Moroccan both with falafel, and I have to say I'd definitely go back for the Moroccan. It has the best sauce of the two and was more tasty.   Secret: There is a beautiful hot sauce that you definitely should add to your pitas. It's a ROSE hot sauce. ROSE! So awesome."}
{"text":"Went here again after the delicious Yelp event and had the Greek pita with chickpea salad. Very tasty and fresh.  Staff is friendly. Limited seating but small patio area outside :)"}
{"text":"Had the moroccan salad and two pitas. It is very tasty but they should fix their door!  It closes amazingly slowly and the chill winter air spills in making it difficult to be warm while eating there.  Fine for take out though!  Very healthy and full of flavour."}
{"text":"Been a few times for lunch, and amazed I'm first to review.  I read about the Queen West location... somewhere? and was really interested - I think because Petra in Jordan is referred to as the Rose City, and it's one of my favourite places on earth. That of course has nothing to do with food though.  So, then, the food. This location is a busy joint co-located with a juice bar and a coffee shop, and at lunch time it's busy, but very efficient with service. Never have to wait long to order, nor to collect on the order.  There's nice bench/big table seating as well.  The menu's not overly complicated - a few options, sandwiches or boxed meals (think a sandwich shoved in a box) and a few protein options. Definitely a good meal for the price, freshly made before your eyes."}
{"text":"There is very little Mediterranean about this place, let alone \"authentic,\" as it markets itself to be. I'm Middle Eastern and I know my ME food, trust me - terrible food, terrible service. Been there twice. Once ordered a box, which came one-third filled and super bland. The second time, half wrap, which was the size of half my palm, so small, I could have fed it to my teacup Yorkie and he would still be left hungry. Why bother?  Now, the service: tried ordering the wrap (above) and the guy was trying to sell me a box instead, suggesting they're a better deal (little does he know); this is after I told him that I need something to eat with one hand given that I needed to push a stroller with the other (evident in my hobbling in with a baby stroller alone). He persisted and so did I. I'm like \"dude, are you gonna push this baby down Queen Street for me while I eat my box?\" For some reason, that sounded wrong. lol  I paid for a bottle of water as well, which he neglected to give me, only realizing half way around the block. So, of course, back I was, fighting with the tightly placed furniture to get myself and my baby in to retrieve my water. Ugh.   Ok, yeah - avoid!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  They use fresh ingredients and give good portions.  I love that they have both healthy and  unhealthy food depending on how good I want to be that day.   I order catering a lot for my office and the peeps love Rose City!    The only criticism I would give is for the management to have more staff during the week.  I feel bad for the kitchen staff because they always seem swamped with catering orders and walk ins which can cause disorganization."}
{"text":"This was a hidden gem that my husband and I stopped into on our way down Queen West. Delicious food, super flavourful and fresh amazing flavours!"}
{"text":"Not good, not good, not good.  The first time I came here was when they were newly opened. I remember the food being pretty great and fresh then thinking, \"this is my new go-to place for lunch!\" Unfortunately, that statement didn't hold considering the sea of other lunch options available in this area.  With this said, I decided to check it out again recently. I was happy to see that they offered a smaller option for the boxed meal, as I wasn't very hungry and wanted something light. I got the Lebanese with chicken - it was an absolute disaster. The rice was dry, portion was SO tiny (even for a small so definitely NOT worth the price) and the garlic sauce was waaaaay too strong. Trust me, I love garlic but not to the point where I feel like I could fend off an army of vampires just with my own breath. It was almost painful to eat.  Disappointing considering how great my first experience was but I will not be returning. Bye!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a light dinner on a nice clear evening and was craving something refreshing. Menu is pretty simple-- you pick your style, your protein (or lack thereof), and your sides (if you want any at all). I ordered the chicken half sandwich Greek style and it was the perfect size. The flavors were refreshing and the sandwich left me full but not overwhelming so. Nice little spot for a quick lunch or a light dinner."}
{"text":"Whoa! Yes, this place is expensive. Yes, I'll probably only come here once in awhile if I want even a sliver of a hope to add to my savings account but - wow, other than minor quibbles over pricing, this place is delicious. I knew about people's issues regarding price prior to coming in, so I wasn't as blatantly surprised when I came up to order.   I don't work too far away, so I dropped by on a weekday at around 12:30 PM right during the lunchtime rush. I ordered the Moroccan salad and asked to have brown rice replaced with kale. I can't describe how wonderful the mix of flavours were - it was spicy, it was sweet, it was unique and very, very fresh. The dressing made the salad, with complex flavours melding the salad together absolutely perfectly. Portion size was only average, but it was very filling. Note that this location has limited seating, with a majority of seats at a long, communal table (so you'll probably be making friends at lunch).  For my Moroccan salad, replacing the brown rice with some kale, I paid around $11."}
{"text":"First time a tried this place the owner must have been there. Food was good, relatively fast, and a good value.   I went at lunch today, same man was not there. There where three busy confused people behind the counter all looking equally miserable. Their were at least 15 people waiting for food! The staff, specifically this young girl with her nose piercing was yelling at the patrons calling out their numbers rudely. Then she proceeded to scratch her nose, and inner eye without washing up after. This is truly disgusting. Same with the other young women scratching her nose and not washing after.   Oh the food, well I ordered the Lebenese, didn't get hummus, barely any lettuce, four slivers of chicken and rice. But their wasn't suppose to be any rice in my dish??? I hate rice in my dish and wouldn't have ordered it if I knew.   This was a waste of time and money!   I feel sorry for the owner who has employees who definitely don't have their hearts in what they have chosen to do!"}
{"text":"I went there one for a chicken wrap and the meat was very burnt. The portions were small and the price was high. Definitely did not get the bang for my buck. FYI, 1 portion is really half a pita so they recommend ordering 2 to make it a meal and 3 if you're really hungry. But honestly, 2 pitas would probably not fill you up. Wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Why still 3 stars, Toronto? This place is excellent for lunch or a quick snack.   Ok, so basically they're handheld, warm pita sandwiches stuffed with room-temperature concoctions of various Mediterranean ingredients organized by geography (Egyptian, Moroccan, Lebanese, Greek), and they're very, very yummy and good! There's also some sides on the menu (kale salad? poutine?) but I haven't tried them.   Overall-- tasty, fresh, delicious! Always leave feeling light and satiated. If I worked closer-by, I'd be here all the time. Great addition to the area, if not Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm on a total Hummus kick lately so I wanted to try this place out.  It's... just okay.  Honestly, I've made better hummus at home.  The texture was off (left the skins on the chickpeas maybe?) and it just wasn't great.  The flavour components were all there (garlic, lemon, tahini) but it just wasn't as addictive as a good hummus should be.    The deep fried pita crisps were amazing. But I mean, it's deep fried bread so duh.    The tzatziki also wasn't too great.  Pros: veggies were fresh and you can tell the kitchen is very clean.  I think they get a decent lunch crowd and I can't judge the meat, but the dips were just meh."}
{"text":"I ate the Moroccan with chicken and got the large box meal, which was $12.   The food itself was good, especially the Harissa dressing, but the portion size was tiny. There were only 3 strips of chicken. Also there was only one apricot and I didn't see any almonds. For $12 dollars I expect to be full until dinner but I'll probably have to eat in an hour or two. I am a 6\" guy so maybe if I were a small girl it would have been filling."}
{"text":"Overall could have been better.  - The Food - Ordered the RCK Original box with falafel option. The listed ingredients on the site sounded appetizing, especially with the home cut fries. Full ingredient list - humus / tabouleh / home fries / carrots / lettuce / garlic oil / cherry harissa dressing.   Despite laying on the counter for some time and my 5min walk, the fries were still crisp and not overly soggy. The highlight was literally the fries and the cherry harissa dressing. I could have just ate that alone. Everything else was just meh. Got mostly lettuce, and the rice was not cooked thoroughly. My biggest disappointment was the falafel. Good quantity, but they were over fried, almost burnt, and hard, as you can see in the pictures. Broke one of the prongs on my fork.   - The Service -  Took forever, despite ordering in advance on my app. In addition the person that made the order and did not even call my name. Hence as mentioned earlier was laying on the counter for around 5-10mins. Buts it a fast food place, could care less about service but call the persons name if their picking up....   Overall gotta say, meh. Good menu concept but the execution could have been better."}
{"text":"There are some damn pretentious reviewers on here, especially the ones bitching about the price. $9 for a box meal and $5 for a half sandwich. Calm down and go to McDonalds if you wanna save a dollar.  The flavors were explosive, and very fresh ingredients. It's a unique style of food so it may not be for everyone. The only issue I had was the chicken. It was very plain, and NOTHING like the delicious shawarma you would get elsewhere. Disappointing, because if they fixed their meats, they could be a 5-star."}
{"text":"I ordered The Moroccan with chicken and it was really bland... Chicken wasn't even marinated, there was 2 piece of apricot, chickpeas had no flavour, and sprinkled with good old plain lettuce and rice. Healthy but it would have been hard to eat if I wasn't so hungry.   Service was friendly but food is overpriced for the lack of quality. The snack box was almost $9!   Would not come here again, but maybe I will give other locations and other flavours a try one day."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing, the owner, the workers, the food especially!  All the flavours are authentic and delicious :)  A must try in Toronto for a cheap bite to eat!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. i got the Moroccan Falafel. Can't wait to go back. It was a little hectic and well worth the wait.  Aces for me!"}
{"text":"came here on a Saturday afternoon, busy but not too crowded. the service was great, the lebanese pita was fab. got free hummus from the guy that seemed to be the owner (and fries too!) l. guess it helps that i also come from the country of the Rose City! it was my second time here and both times were pleasant."}
{"text":"I am waiting at rose city... Been waiting 15 mins for a falafel sandwich..... There is one girl working her ass off. A man in the back 'tending' the meat. The male owner was dressed in a fancy suit not doing anything. The female owner decided to help a bit later. I'm hungry...."}
{"text":"some start-up jitters and the portions were a bit smaller than i'm use to, but the variety and quality of the food was very good.  simple decor, but it's not really a hang out place.  will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"\"a rose by any other name would smell as sweet\" but rose city kitchen ain't no rose and it smells like stink.  what mediterranean restaurant in the city would not have chicken or steak ready at 11:35? and then run out by 12:15?! it's as preposterous as a chinese joint running out of rice.   RCK use to be unique. it use to have delicious fare. no more.   go to byblos. go to tabule. go to ghazale. go to pita pit for tastiness' sake! it really doesn't matter. anywhere that's even remotely mediterranean is better than rose city kitchen.   \"crappy food and service, i see, hath been its timeless end.\"   let this place die. ________________  Comment from James S. of Rose City Kitchen  6/7/2016   Hi Channing,  We're glad to report, following this review we checked out ventilation and air-conditioning filters and found them to be in tip-top shape. Also, our windows were found to be in working order.  We investigated the smell of stink you experienced and concluded the smell must've been caused by the persona you brought to the premises and failed to leave else where.  We ask, should you decide to visit us again, given the death wishes, you leave your negative personality at our front door, and leave yourself open to experience the amazing flavours Rose City has to offer that our regulars love dearly.  ________________  you misunderstood me. when i said \"stink\", i meant it metaphorically (the rose quote is originally from shakespeare).   i love rose city kitchen, but the queen street location.   of the three times that i've been to the king street location (which is closer to my work), there have been major goof ups. going three times to a bad establishment is charitable of any restaurant goer. ________________  Comment from James S. of Rose City Kitchen  8/3/2016   UPDATE: Channing, The advice I give to any consumer is should they have not of had an positive experience when visiting an establishment the best thing you can do is bring it to managements attention. Given I run both locations I am disappointed that you have failed as a consumer to do so.  I would like to remind you this is a welcoming and open forum to fix your experience, but given the days we live in, everyones an expert in everything, including Restaurant Operations.  ________________  staff were acutely aware of the problems. and out of at least two of my visits, management was as well. they were apologetic. however, while apologies might elicit another visit (as i did with me), apologies without change produces annoyance.   if, of the 3 times i went, i was the hapless victim of uncommon breakdowns, then my bad review will be overshadowed by a slew of good ones by other yelpers. that's how it works in the age we live in.   i'm not stingy with stars. my average rating is 3.7 and i won't give 1 star without more than one visit. i wish you future success, but my review is an accurate reflection of the experiences i had at rck king location."}
{"text":"I visited Rose City Kitchen over the summer for a Yelp event, and was excited to try one of their wraps since I love Mediterranean ingredients. The menu at Rose City Kitchen ranges from pita sandwiches, poutines, salads, fries, and falafel. Since I do not eat onions my options were quite limited. However, the staff tried to be accommodating and created a salad without onions that included ingredients that I liked - a combination of the Greek and Moroccan salad. I also ordered the pita with steak. Unfortunately the steak did not taste like steak, instead it tasted like ground beef, and I am not a fan of ground beef.  Overall, I liked that the ingredients were fresh, the menu was affordable with a good number of options, and they were flexible with my onion-hatred. I would definitely return to try something else from their menu - their poutine sounds delicious.  **Extra props for being gluten-friendly. I have a friend that has a hard time finding restaurants that will accommodate her gluten intolerance, but at Rose City Kitchen you have the option of choosing  a gluten-free pita."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch and I quite like the food but it's not always a fun place to be...   So RCK does small pita sandwiches with different fillings and different styles/flavours. You choose your protein, and then your flavour profile (Egyptian, Greek, Lebanese, among others). My favourite is the Lebanese (garlic sauce and pickles) with halloumi cheese. They grill it on the flat top which makes it crispy and warm. Yum! I haven't tried their fries but I've had the Moroccan salad, and I didn't like it very much...Maybe it was just my palate and that's how it's supposed to taste, but it simply didn't taste right. It was too tangy and the seasoning seemed off; unbalanced, although it was filled with really good stuff like chickpeas and couscous. That was a thumbs down for me. Portions are pretty small which are perfect for me but someone else may need 2 pitas to be satisfied.   The food is a definite 4-star but something about the place makes me uneasy. Service has been pretty spotty as other people have mentioned, and I never really feel welcomed into the place. Staff behind the counter always seem a little bored or resentful to be there and take my order almost scathingly. And now that someone has mentioned it, I have encountered the owner more than once and she never seems like a happy person... Kinda brings the place down. I think the vibe and the attitude of the place needs some work.   Overall, it's a nice place to stop in for a quick bite but sometimes I'm a little put off by the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried it again and it was Even worse than the last time! The small Egyptian box (almost $9) had inconsistent cold spots, raw chunks of cabbage, mushy greasy eggplant and 2 small pieces of burned falafel. It made me feel sick and I couldn't eat it, not good quality, value, or flavour."}
{"text":"Mediterranean style flatbread sandwiches that are decent but pretty small for the price. Interiors are bright and clean - there are a few tables and stools for dining-in though I wouldn't recommend it during a hot or crowded day. Lunch hour gets pretty busy but even when there aren't many people at dinner time, it's still a bit of a wait for the food. Sandwich orders involve choosing a style and a protein. Last visit I got the RCK Original with falafel and the Lebanese with chicken ($5 each) - both were tasty with a good spread of ingredients. While they market that 1 sandwich is a snack and 2 is a meal, 2 is definitely not enough! I was pretty hungry soon after."}
{"text":"The halloumi sandwich is the bomb! I would drive from Markham just to et this sandwich. Every time I visit Toronto, I have to stop by Rose to get a halloumi sandwich!"}
{"text":"Rose City Kitchen is a decent lunch option, or light and healthy snack while in the Spadina/Queen area. They seem to have a bad rap on Yelp with the 3 star rating, but I do believe there is value here to be offered, if they work on their brand as a whole. The menu ignites my appetite for eating cuisine from different regions, as they've split it into a variety of Greek, Egyptian, Lebanese, and Moroccan inspired meal choices.  Must-try items: Any half sandwich with home fries, salad etc.  The $10 box meal is very straightforward. You choose a protein and a side, for which there are several options including home fries, tabouleh, veggies, salad, and more. They could work on the overall experience of dining in, the friendliness and customer service levels of the staff, and some other minor issues. However, the food was of the quality that would bring me back to try other items. Not a bad place at all, and this location is convenient for those living and working in the area."}
{"text":"*3.5  Rose City Kitchen is an awesome change up, especially with it's range of Mediterranean flavours to mix and match (\"RCK\" Original, Greek, Lebanese, Morrocan and Egyptian).   But really, good God... A Middle Eastern Poutine?! Give it ALL to me. The RCK Poutine ($7) is a beautiful bed of sumac-seasoned fries that's topped with grated halloumi, hummus aioli and taboulleh. I added on a (bargain-riffic!!!) $1 for falafels on top - and there were four of them (55c/each, otherwise)! Tangy with the right amount of halloumi and aioli.  For Sandwiches ($5), I had the Greek w/Chicken and Morrocan w/Steak - the protein was dry and sad. I just really, really liked the flavours.   *Be prepared to wait about 10 minutes if you're doing take-out! *Do try their rose-infused chili oil if you fancy a mouth-full of roses."}
{"text":"This place used to be good, like, right when it opened. Shortly after though, it went downhill from there. The fries, well not just the fries, but everything was greasy. There would literally be a pool of grease at the bottom (the rice couldn't even soak it all). Between all the sauce and grease, they've also cut down the amount of protein they gave. The individual parts are good though, the chicken can be extremely dry though."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for a 3-pita takeout order at RCK. There was no line when I got there, but I soon realized that everyone else in the place had already placed their orders and also were waiting an extremely long time for their food. Regardless, it wasn't *that* busy to justify such a long wait. I think part of the problem is the menu is too large for a takeout-type place (too many pitas with too many ingredients, lots of different side dishes) and there's clearly no system in place.  I don't care if this is the best pita sandwich in the world -- and it's far from it (the chicken is terribly dry; why do they not have a proper spit?) -- you should never have to wait 30 minutes for a falafel or chicken pita sandwich anywhere.  1-star for the wait, 3 stars for the food. Not worth it, at all."}
{"text":"After coming off a long flight, we were excited to try this place. Heard good reviews.  My wife and I both got the Lebanese with chicken shawarma. She got the pita and I got the box. I've had shawarmas and such before and I know my stuff, this stuff was gross. The kale salad had more iceberg lettuce than kale. The pita wrap was lacking a lot of flavour. The chicken in the box I got was terrible. It had no spices, there wasn't even a spit or anything. If it wasn't for the hot sauce, I wouldn't have eaten it.  I honestly think that this place is really not worth it and I would never go back. I would actually rather go to McDonald's and I haven't been there for 15 years.  Terrible place, not authentic, and just terrible."}
{"text":"Rose City Kitchen (@RoseCityKitchen) is the newly opened Middle Eastern snack bar on Queen West with the menu design by Shontelle Pinch from Gourmet Bitches.  It's a cute 15 seats intimate snack bar style space, perfect location and space to drop by for lunch, a snack or even a light dinner. Love the eye catching red tile wood oven where pita are baked fresh.    Ordering was easy, picked a region then the protein and love how they even suggest how many you should order : 1 for a snack, 2 for a meal and 3 if you're starving.   Humus $2.00 + Pita $1.00 ~ The pita was just so moist and pillowy soft, love love love it. The humus was just I like it with the perfect balance of lemon, sesame and garlic.  RCK Hot Sauce ~ Made with real roses, it was not very spicy but on the sweet side and slightly acidic with a delicate floral notes.   RCK Original w/Falafel $3.50 ~ humus, tabouleh, home, fries, carrots, lettuce, garlic oil, cherry harissa dressing ~ One of the best falafel I have ever had, full of aromatic herbs and with crunchy outside and a moist meaty feel to the inside. No wonder they put their name on this one, perfect balance of flavors and texture.  ~ I always choose falafel over the other meat and I love this one.  Moroccan w/ Chicken $4.00 ~ harissa dressing, couscous, lettuce, red onions, tomatoes, almonds, apricots, parsley, chickpeas ~ This was my favorite, this one had a slight kick to it which is balance with the sweet apricot. With the chickpeas in this one, I think it'll be better with meat than the falafel.    Egyptian w/ Steak $4.50 ~eggplant, red onions, chickpeas, dates, cabbage, lemon juice, garlic oil ~ I found this too sweet for my taste and didn't really like the steak which was on the dry side.   The salad look great too, will have to try one next time.   Verdict : ~ This was definitely different compare to our usual pita/falafel places. ~ Everything tasted fresh and healthier ~ And the pita was so good, so good that I think I can eat it on it's own."}
{"text":"I rarely disagree with my favourite peanut gallery of all time (Yelp Toronto), and I'm genuinely surprised that Rose City Kitchen is sitting pretty at a three star average.   I've only been once, but lemme say it loud and proud: Yay! I'm a fan!   I came in here with two of my best Mo Bros to get some of their mix and match pitas. Under $5 each, but you prob want two plus for lunch, you know, if you're over 12. I went with the Greek with falafel and then I saw it: RCK poutine. Screw the second sandwich, ammi right?! I was momentarily upset to find out that it wasn't a real poutine, but more like middle-eastern inspired fries, but I went for it. It was delicious. Try it."}
{"text":"Great lunch at rck - will definitely be returning!  A modern twist on the classic falafel.  The staff were super friendly and helpful.  The food was freshly made and fast."}
{"text":"3.5  Got the same thing AGAIN! Delicious as usual but it's a dangerous place to go during lunch hour! There were so many people and my order took about 15 minutes! My coworker got the RCK sandwich its 5 bucks and kind of small but apparently tasted good! Lower your prices!!!"}
