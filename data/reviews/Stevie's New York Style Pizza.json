{"text":"Best pizza!! From the sauce to the quality of cheese, the taste of their pizza is amazing! Reminds me of NY pizza. I love just dropping in for a slice or two if I get a craving."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza!! Best NY style pizza in AZ.
My son had it at School (his friend ordered4 for a in school special lunch day at Legend Springs Elementary) and raved about it.
Got two pies tonight- a Giant Pepperoni and a Medium Special. The Giant was Giant and perfect for him and his friends. The Medium was like a large and all fresh ingredients - perfect crust and sauce! 
Yummy! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food was good I really enjoyed my Philly sandwich, the pizza had good flavor, but the tables were all dirty and we were one of two customers in the place and they made us get up and get our food even some fast food places will bring your food to you. It is the little things that make people want to come back."}
{"text":"Last minute decision to have pizza delivered and wanted to try something new. We ordered a half pepperoni and half meatball pizza, a side of mild wings and an order of the mushrooms. 

The pizza was very good. Great NY style crust and good sauce. We ordered the wings extra crispy and were pleased that's how they arrived. The mushrooms were my favorite! Cooked perfectly...sometimes mushrooms can arrive \"mushy\" where the mushroom and batter meet, but these were perfect. 

Delivery took about an hour from time of order to time of delivery, which is a little faster than what we were quoted...easy to order online. The delivery person was very friendly.

Will definitely order from them again. We still prefer coal brick oven thin/crispy crust pizza to the traditional NY style crust, the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. If you prefer NY crust to thin/crispy then Stevie's is your place."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had. I'm from Chicago and have had many different pizza types from pan to the thin crust.

I have been on a pizza hunt to find the most authentic pizza in Arizona and finally found the spot."}
{"text":"Due to the great reviews and single $ rating, decided to try delivery from Stevie's. Got a medium cheese w/ham and a medium special. Expected better crust; this just broke when you fold it and tasted closer to soda cracker than one would expect. And, the 2 mediums were $36 before tip. Bottom line, I paid as much as Barro's or Marco's for pizza that I enjoyed less than the Hut's. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I go here frequently for lunch.  Great little place and I love the lunch special...Italian sandwich please.  Nice folks...love the mom and pop feel where the owner works behind the counter."}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza is really good! The garlic knots are yummy too. I'm from NYC born and raise and this is the closest I have gotten to NYC  in arizona."}
{"text":"I am from New York and this is New York Pizza. This is as good as it will get out here in the SouthWest......and for a change of pace try their Buffalo Chicken Pizza or their Philly Cheese Steak Pizza...both excellant!! Pasta dishes and sandwiches are also very good here. If you never had NY Pizza (Young S) you shouldnt comment....this is the real deal."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and phenomenal pizza. You will not regret coming to eat here or ordering out for the family!"}
{"text":"OMG!  Why haven't I been to Stevie's before today?!  I live in Arrowhead Ranch and grocery shop at Fry's all the time.
It's not like I didn't know that Stevie's wasn't there!
But today was the day I decided I'm starving  - and I need Italian!  I'm going to Stevie's!!
 
I got there about 3:00 and Joe, the guy who \"creates\" the food, saw that I was using a walker, so he immediately came over and opened the door for me.  What a gentleman!

It smelled like heaven inside, and while I was deciding what to eat I ordered an Appetizer Sampler - Yum!!
I decided on a Calzone with 3 add-ins: sausage, green pepper & onion.  It came to the table an oooey, gooey cheesy, garlicy taste of heaven.  It was so big, I only ate half of it.

Well, today was the first time I've eaten here, but it will definitely not be the last. There are so many menu offerings to try.  I can't wait to try a Stromboli, the cheese steak 'sammich', the stuffed shells, the eggplant parmigiana -  - and of course the canoli!    

I plan to become \"a  regular\" at Stevie's.

One more thing:  Not only was Joe a very helpful, personable guy, but Beshe (I think that's how she spells her name) was a very helpful server, too.  She brought me boxes for my leftovers, and was very sweet.

I'm sorry, Steve, I didn't mean to wait so long to come eat at your place -  but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried the half buffalo chicken, half cheese steak. I love the thin crust, I only had the chicken side and really liked it. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. Food was average. We ordered online for pickup. When I picked it up they acted like they didn't know I had ordered. After they found it and I got all the way home, I realized they didn't put chicken on my husbands fetuccini and they forgot his bread and ranch. I called and told them and my husband went all the way back to correct his order. When he got there they gave him chicken but no fetuccini because \" he already got those \". Never mind the inconvenience or the fact that now he has warm chicken to put on his cold noodles. I called back to complain and the manager said there was a misunderstanding. Pathetic customer service and the food isn't good enough to get treated badly and deal with people that have no business dealing with customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely rude, demeaning, and horrible customer service! Have lost my business forever."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place for the first time, and it won't be the last. It's classic, simple, delicious NY style pizza. I find that smaller, independent pizza joints are often better than the Domino's and Pizza Huts of the world, friendly staff as well..."}
{"text":"They are kind of weird about when they will deliver to our area and when they won't, but the pizza is good enough to make the drive ourselves. We like supporting family owned businesses and this family has been serving up delicious pies on the westside since I was a kid."}
{"text":"There are many mom and pop pizza places in town but everytime I call these guys they are excellent.  The phone peeps always seem knowledgable the food is good, and I will keep going back"}
{"text":"Always amazing food!!  Pizza rolls are one of my favorites.  My son loves the buffalo style pizza, also we both enjoy the pasta in vodka sauce (not sure of name lol).  Everyone is always friendly and it's a family atmosphere.    Definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I moved to the area about a year ago and this is definitely my go to place for good pizza. Being a transplanted NYer now living in the desert, it's hard to find good pizza. It makes me mad when I see all these lousy places advertising \"NY style pizza\" when it's a bunch of lies. I love Stevie's pizza! They're about as close to NY style pizza I can get outside of New York! ANDDDD they have garlic knots! Yum to the max! I also love the decor in the restaurant- lots of canvas prints of NY. Very cool. Thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza's I've had in AZ. Also, possibly the best Calzone's I've ever had period. I am from NY and this is def one of the better pizza spots in AZ that I've came across so far."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!! Friendly staff, WONDERFUL customer service!! The food quality is outstanding and for the price, it doesn't get anymore affordable! !! They are our  \"go to pizza guys\"!!!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is DELISH!! They're also very conveniently located right off the 101, so it's easy to be in and out. The pizza reminds me of east coast pizza with a sturdier crust, it's very good. This and Ballpark Pizza and Subs in Peoria/Glendale have probably been the best pizzas we've had on the west side of town."}
{"text":"Ordered this pizza, sausage & pepperoni, price not bad $18.50 for a delivered large, but it just has like absolutely NO taste, doesn't taste bad, just not like anything. Think someone stole their spice rack & they better get a new one. Wouldn't order again (sorry)"}
{"text":"Great food and the owner was very nice. We had extended family so we tried the pizza, calzone, spaghetti, rolls and salad. It was all very good. East Coast pizza. Big slices and the calzone was off the hook."}
{"text":"On vacation and ordered delivery. Very fast and one of the most delicious pizzas we've ever had. Even the next day when reheated, it was amazing!!!!! Highly recommend to anyone in the area. They even went out of their way to deliver a little further out of their way for us!"}
{"text":"I've never posted on yelp but this pizza was so poor it left me feeling sad. Needed to let future pizza seekers know it was quite a disappoint in hopes that I might feel slightly better! 

Highlights: I was starving and pizza is normally a treat. Gigantic size veggie/special + cheese bread sounded good. 
Lowlights: lacking sauce, bad marinara, no flavor, slightly cold, bland and somehow the cheese bread was equally tasteless.

Very confused how this place has 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is the first time here for me. My boyfriend changed our dinner plans at the last minute...so I had pretty high expectations. We ordered a half Cheese steak, half buffalo chicken..and a slice of the white pizza. Whew! I want to keep on eating, it is sooo good! I can't even tell you which one was my favorite! Nice thin dough, with the perfect amount of toppings. I can't wait to have it again!"}
{"text":"Well after coming here for 2+ years now I figured I should write a review. The pizza here is amazing. Yes, it really is that good. I used to live close by but have since moved about 15-20 minutes away. However I will still make the drive back here when I am craving pizza. The dough is fresh and just the right texture. Above all the consistency is what keeps me coming back. I know that every time I come here I can count on the pizza being as good as the last time. Try this place out, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Pizza was better then the wings. Service was friendly and fairly priced.  I lived 4 miles away and no BS delivery. $2 charge. Seems fair. I ordered a supreme and asked to sub the bell peppers for extra cheese. No hesitation. I appreciated that. In their defense I ordered wings mild. Which they delivered. The bland flavor certainly could have had to do with my flavor choice. In my opinion wings are either wet or dry. These were the dry variety. By dry I mean sauce level not taste. Go for regular Buffalo Flavor you'll probably be fine"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  My daughter and I split a cheese calzone and an order of fried mushrooms.  The calzone was stuffed full and the marinara sauce on the side was flavorful and obviously made in house.  The food was way better than I expected to get in a place I entered on a whim.  The place is family owned and they make everything fresh.  I will make a point to visit whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"Decided to try here after seeing the reviews. It was excellent! I really love the crust, it's not too thick and not too thin, nor is it too dense or airy. Sauce is fantastic as well, overall we loved the pizza. We got hot wings as well and they were pretty good. My wife is from buffalo, so her wing standards are way up there and she even said these were good. Wing sauce could of been a bit hotter, but I'd definitely order them again. We will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"We have been Stevie's lovers for a few years but the last 2 times we have been hugely disappointed.  We are from Philly and this was the closest we have ever had in Phoenix to home.  BUT the last few times it has been horrible, cheese is hard and not gooey, tonights was so dry.  What has happened?  Did it change hands?"}
{"text":"We ordered several pizzas for a family dinner. Service and food met our expectations.  The sandwices are a great deal. We will return."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town!! I've always been a Ray's Pizza fan but Stevie's beat them in my book!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it was an epic failure by Stevies pizza. Pizza was cold and soggy; wings were dry and overcooked. Also they decided to not honor their pizza special and overcharged me. Called to resolve the issue and they offered a $5 credit? Laughable. Update: manager later called to apologize and offer $20 off our bill. The pizza isn't as the good as reviews but maybe bc it was cold?"}
{"text":"The owner obviously cares and the service shows it.  The pie was A-OK.  While I was there someone showed up after ordering wrong and the owner took care f it.  Pretty cool."}
{"text":"Great, great pizza, definitely New York style, and fast delivery. If they had green olives we'd be in pizza heaven, but as things are we're darned close."}
{"text":"I appreciate your apology and will remove this review. I know business and life can be stressful,  but always remember to stay humble and loyal to your customers."}
{"text":"Major Fail. Despite the fact that you could fold the slice, the pizza was your classic cardboard slice of Phoenix junk. Yes, I know it says NY style and I know these folks are from NY, but in all my travels throughout the West Coast that never matters much. Well, being from Staten Island some would argue is not really being from NY. There was a reason that was the only borough I never set foot in growing up in the big apple. It doesn't mean that all Staten Island pizza is bad, but this pizza was just a plain fraud. The crust did not crack upon folding and was way too dry to even choke down. Everything else just was chain like and miserable and lack of sauce or any actual seasonings in sauce was quite evident.. Somehow, these folks have two locations, but people in Phoenix, which contain mostly midwest folks, have no clue about good NY pizza, so they obviously are taking the bait. Everyone else who reviews this place and claims NY status really are clueless as well. Maybe Stevie can take the train to Manhattan and find a new recipe for his pies - he is really doing a great con job and a poor representation of real NY pizza."}
{"text":"Really tough to say any pizza is great NY style pizza... because it's really tough to say what is NY style pizza... Lower East side to the Bronx you can hit 50 pizza places in a straight line and get such a variety that it inherently defies classification...
That being said... Stevie's is what I think of when I want NY style pizza... in addition, Stevie's makes calzones, stromboli's, pizza rolls and garlic knots... Tough to find the last 3 anywhere, let alone as good as Stevie's.
So, try it once if you if you like NY style... NW metro area is distinctly barren of any pizza of note and I owe my discovery to fellow yelper's... so thanks."}
{"text":"Damn this is good pizza it's the best actually I drive 15 miles just to get it. I wonder if they ship the water in from New York or they must change the pH or something in the water. I don't know I'm really just writing and talking because I don't want this to be a tip I want to be an actual review I have nothing to say just that damn this pizza is good."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. We usually pick up pizza from here when we come over my moms house.  Good prices, awesome pizza & service!!!!! Truly reminds me of New York. It's a small place and busy but always timely. A true GEM!"}
{"text":"This place is just incredible.. Real tasty pizza! This place is just simple and good. The staff is amazing! Love coming here because I always leave smiling and in a good mood. The pizza comes out fast, hot, and tasty! If you want good pizza around this area you should eat here. Better than spending your money on Dominos or Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Why I have not gone to Stevie's sooner. Been in the hood a long time, as we have too.  Seen, thought about it, passed it up.  This is probably the best pizza in the NW valley.  Did I mention I am not a big pizza fan, but I will eat it at Stevie's!"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza.  Double peperroni extra cheese and extra crispy is the way to go.  Not everyone knows the extra ceispyr trick (or likes crust that way) but lots of new yorkers like it that way and I have to agree.  The wings are average, but the special cheap.  So the 5 star rating is based on pizza alone."}
{"text":"Tried most of the menu. Everything is delicious. Most favorites are buffalo chicken pizza, garlic knots and lasagna. Great service and fast delivery ! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great wings!  Pizza is excellent too.  The delivery is fast.   Our family loves eating there."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here! After living in Arizona for the past few years, I've tried a variety of different places in addition to the standard chains of Pizza Hut/Domino's and I have to say nothing really compares to Stevie's! I love that they make a good, simple, delicious New York style pizza for an affordable price. They have the perfect balance of crust/cheese/sauce and every slice is delicious as the last. Everyone that I've had try their pizza has been converted into a fan. I'm definitely going to miss this pizza when I move back home. I hope they stay in business forever so I can come back every time I visit AZ!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've had in a while, hands down! Found this place through Grubhub and I'm glad I did. Delivery took 45 minutes to hour but it was worth the wait. I ordered 2 pies, both at their \"gigantic\" size. One was just plain cheese and the other was a 1 topping which I got as pepperoni. The crust was amazing, it had that chew that most people look for in authentic NY pizza. The sauce was on point, not too much, just the right amount. And the cheese...the cheese was great. My wife and I both agree that we've found our pizza place since moving to Phoenix and it's Stevie's."}
{"text":"Stick to the pizza and wings. Had a sausage sub and fired mushrooms and they were ....let's just say never ever again. We do enjoy the pizza and wings but not much else. If you asked me yesterday is would have said 4 stars but not after that sub and mushrooms."}
{"text":"Please try. Cheese manicotti (w salad and garlic knots). Slice of buffalo chicken pizza. Drink. All for 12 bucks. And absolutely fantastic.  Believe the reviews. Excellent."}
{"text":"I've had at least 40 pizzas delivered and although the wait is about an hr. It's so worth it.Hand down the best pizza in the north west bravo boys.I'm a customer for life."}
{"text":"The Bomb! True back east pizza...finally in AZ!!! Great food, excellent customer service with quick delivery too!"}
{"text":"Stevie's is always very good! Best pizza on this side of town! Dough is super flavorful, sauce is great, quality cheese, ingredients are always fresh. I like the extras like fresh garlic on the garlic cheese bread. Everything we've had is always good! Never been disappointed. 
Delivery times can be long but they always let you know when orderinf. Typically it's about an hour but we've had shorter times than that. If you like New York style pizza do yourself a favor and try this place out!"}
{"text":"Stevies pizza is very good! Excellent pizza and awesome wings. One of the best pizzas is Phoenix. Definitely the best in the north valley."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area. Really convenient to be able to pick up a tasty slice of pizza to-go. Staff is always really friendly. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"What do you get when you cross a pizza with a buffalo wing. You get a buffalo chicken pizza. This was exactly what I was promised at this little pizza shop right off the 101. It is a pretty good slice of pie and I can only imagine it is true New York style considering I have not been to New York before. It has some heat to it, flavor was good, and the crust was pretty good. It exceeded my expectations probably because every buffalo chicken pizza I have had up until that point was pretty horrible. I guess low expectations are easier to exceed than high ones. I also had a slice of pepperoni along with the buffalo chicken type. It was pretty good as well. I am not calling it the best in town but it was flavorful.

A couple notes here. One, the value is pretty good for the lunch menu. I didn't peek around for dinner menus for the other things that included full pizzas and sandwiches. Two, when I went there was a gentlemen at the table closest to the service counter. He had a newspaper spread out over the entire table, two plates of food, and didn't appear to have anywhere to be. He would call out to Stevie over the counter from time to time to ask him about his business or one of his employees. They talked with a thick accent so I assume they were both from New York. I guess I was thrown off because apparently in New York they are okay with one person occupying a four person table during a lunch hour rush and forcing others to sit everywhere but there."}
{"text":"Such a great neighborhood pizza joint! My brother and few of my friends always talk about how good Stevie's is. I was always so skeptical seeing how I had never heard of them, they are not a chain, and they just didn't stick out to me in any special way. Well my husband and I decided to give it a try Super Bowl Sunday and we were pleasantly surprised. The prices were crazy good, the pizza was great pizza, your average delivery house crust, nice tangy sauce, stringy cheese, the sauces and mushrooms were flavorful and plenty,  the wings were exactly what I like, big and crispy with just the right amount of medium sauce. I will most definitely be ordering from here again soon."}
{"text":"Went to get my hair done the other day and picked up the menu for the pizza parlor next door to my salon...they deliver so gave it a shot that night. I have not seen real Salad Pizza in a pizzeria since I left NY (NYPD has a salad pizza on the menu but its not the real deal and when they deliver it you have to assemble it yourself). This salad pizza is authentic and not as messy as you get back home and I loved it...really good. Its rare that I get a cheese pie delivered where the crust is crisp and warm without being somewhat burned...to my shock the cheese pie was perfecto. Great cheese and sauce. Also liked the woman who took my order on the phone, called me \"Hun\",  just like home. They gave me a 45 min delivery time but rang the bell in less than 30 min..  We have a new go-to pizzeria. Yay."}
{"text":"Like the thin crust on the pizza. It crisped up nicely on the reheat.
Not greasy like many pizza places."}
{"text":"Just what I needed, located in a small strip mall near MWU.  Reminds me of all the pizza shops back East, with the decor of typical NYC buildings, but most importantly, THE PIZZA!  I was craving that crispy pizzeria type slices that are reminiscent of the East Coast and after a few places, I've finally found it here at Stevie's!

Pizza slices were big, foldable, thin, and crispy with chewy/soft crust - how an East coast slice should be.  They honor MWU student discounts 10% off and gave me the lunch special 2 slices with 2 toppings and a drink for around $7, even around 8pm.

When I'm craving an east coast slice, I'll be sure to be back!"}
{"text":"Omg I just got the spinach calizone and it was so flipping good.  Perfect size for one person. Cant wait to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I placed an ordered here about a month ago and just forgot to do this review so here it is. I had the chicken wing and pizza deal the wings were soggy but flavorful and the pizza was cold and bland. I literally ate one slice and threw the rest of the pizza away a few days later. I did warm up the wings and eat those but this is a place I will not be ordering from again."}
{"text":"The only thing contributing to the NY authenticity here is the service. The crust falls short somewhere in between the line of cardboard and the styrofoam you'll find in a car bumper. The pizza as a whole looks like something you'll find in the frozen aisle and tastes even more disintegrated. That may be attributed to them baking cheese pizzas and reheating with whatever toppings you order. It doesn't work that way and to do so in New York would be an automatic death sentence endorsed even by their appalled Jersey neighbors. To call Stevie's New York Style Pizza would be analogous to calling Digiorno Delivery. It's NOT."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza and wings! This is definitely the best pizza/wing joint I have found in the valley. Food is delicious and is always ready fast. Great customer service as well. Everyone there is very friendly and welcoming. It is literally the only place my family and I go now for pizza and wings."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker I am picky about pizza.  This place is really good.  Their pizza is true New York style.  Great customer service.  Try their family size calzone, really good and a bargain to feed the family."}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza experience I have ever had. First of all, the pizza is WAY over priced for the quality. The pizza was delivered late and they forgot one of my pizzas. I asked the driver and he went out to his car to \"check\" and drove away. I had to call and was given a new pizza an hour later. The sauce was super watery and by the time my new pizza had arrived it was cold. I don't recommend that anyone eat here ever. Total waste of money.

Management cannot handle criticism. Rather than improving the business, they insult their customers. It's not that I'm \"cheap\" or cannot afford the pizza, I prefer to not eat crap. As an Italian who just returned from Rome, I know quality pizza and let me tell you, this is far from it. You're better off purchasing a Tostino's frozen pizza or stopping at your local gas station that serves pizza because it's the same quality."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for New York style pizza and found Stevie's. I'm pretty persnickety about pizza, so I ordered from Stevie's feeling like I was taking a chance. When I saw their prices, I was a little concerned. I didn't expect to get really good pizza for under $20. But 45 minutes later I had hot, fresh, tasty New York style pizza delivered to my front door. It wasn't 5-star NYC pizza (not nearly greasy enough!), but it was as good as anything I've found in the valley. They didn't overdo it with the sauce, and the toppings were high quality. Next time I might get extra cheese."}
{"text":"Okay... first time visit and this also marks the first time I didn't try the pizza right away. The reviews on the pizza are in and the photos say a lot..  I'm really looking forward to having the pizza! Today I was on a different mission... I noticed on the menu they have \"Chicken Roll\"... WHAT?!? If you from NY or anywhere in the tri-state area you know what a chicken roll is. Out here in Phoenix-metro??? Good luck! So I was REALLY looking forward to this! When I walked to the counter I even asked to make sure, \"How do you make your chicken roll?\" The answer (which is correct) was chicken in mozz cheese in a roll that is similar to a calzone. You get marinara sauce so you can dip it. So I had my answer and I was ready!!!! Chicken Roll me please!!!!!!! I also got a side order of meatballs because, well...I love meatballs and I can tell a lot about a restaurant's food merely how they make their meatballs and how the sauce tastes.

Long story short (I know, I know, too late..... lol) In a word, DELICIOUS! The chicken roll was on point, the sauce was really good, and the meatballs.... Perfect!!!! This is THE only place I know that has chicken rolls on the menu and it does not let down! $5 for the chicken roll and this is a decent size. No it' not the size of whole table but just perfect!!

I can't wait to try their pizza and other food.... Zeppole?? You've got to be kidding me?? I can't WAIT! Canoli, Italian Ice, wings?? It's like a corner NY pizza place right here in Glendale!"}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza! Our go to pizza place! They also have the best cannolis out here!"}
{"text":"Very good thin crust pizza and super friendly service. Seating is a little cramped and awkward so I just do take out."}
{"text":"Great place. Havent gone here since i was a kid. Probably 10 years ago. Hasnt changed much. Ordered a large pepperoni pizza and two orders of gsrlic knots. 20 minute wait time for pickup. About average. Got there at about the 17 minute marker and food was hot and ready. Ranch is decent but could be better if you ask me. Im very picky about ranch though. Overall a great place. Good service and great food. The marinara sauce that comes with the garlic knots is to die for. Ill be back."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome- crisp crusting, great flavor.  Great cheese blend.  Wings were top notch - great tangy sauce, mild was perfectly spicy.  Great service too- staff are way cool.  Go to Stevie's"}
{"text":"We've tried a lot of pizza joints in the metro area. Was looking for something new to try. Just haven't found \"The One\" for us yet near our house. So, it's \"New York\" style. I have to say, it's just meh. Sauce flavor was good. Value for the money was on par. Amount of toppings was good. Overall quality was right there. But, there wasn't anything about it that stood out enough for another try, for us."}
{"text":"Some of the best Pizza and Chicken wings in AZ.  I visit my parents every Friday with my kids and we almost always order from Stevie's.  There Pizza and Wing deal is a great price and absolutely delicious.  The staff knows my order right when I call and are it's always hot and ready to go when I get there.  I order my wings extra crispy and they are perfect.  It's like eating in New York, without the cost of going there."}
{"text":"Great calzones, check it out! The owner is really nice and offers quality service with quality food"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about Joe and the gang at Stevies... Just awesome people who provide great, often hilarious, service and food that is among my very favorite. I love shops owned by people rather than corporations and make a point to spend my money with them. These guys are great!"}
{"text":"Short Story 

Pizza is better than other in the neighborhood that I tried but the salad and the cheese steak don't rate as high for me.

Longer Story

After purchasing not so fresh fish for dinner from Whole Foods we needed something for dinner and my husband suggested to try Stevie's NYS Pizza. They told us an hour for delivery or 10 minutes to pick up so he picked up. The pizza had a good quality cheese and a tasty sauce. I liked the nice thin crust but I thought it was a little mild flavored. The pizza was good but not oily like a true New York Pizza.

We went back and had a cheese steak, Chicken Caesar Salad, and something unusual that Stevie's offers called rolls sort of like a smaller Stromboli and we tried a spinach one. Out of what we tried we both liked the Spinach Roll best. The roll was bigger than we excepted for $4.00 and can be a meal since you can pick meat options. I thought it needed a little salt and pepper to taste better and the roll came with some tasty marinara sauce. The high light of the Caesar Salad were the three garlic knots that they give you with it but the romaine lettuce was very fresh. The cheese steak came on a decent roll.

This place has the weirdest seats I ever saw in a pizza place. They were called beard seats and looked sort of like car seats. 

Worth a try for pizza or the stuffed rolls!

{"text":"Two words. Time. Efficient.

My sister and I ordered a medium cheese pizza for pick up. We were told it would take 15 minutes and after arriving at the restaurant, we were handed our freshly baked pizza 15 minutes on the dot after we called. Little things like accurate time approximations keep customers happy and coming back and Stevie's has that down."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza for the family! Huge slices!!! Consistent quality... we will definitely be ordering from here for a long time."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Stevie's once before at the store, but this time I ordered over the phone. The order took 1hr 10 minutes.  When I called at 1 hr, I complained about the time and asked for the owner. I was told I was talking to the owner. Well, his non-caring attitude and oh well conversation was the last straw. He did not mind at all that I would not be ordering in the future.  Well, I and many of my friends around the area have stopped calling his pizza place.  I know it will not do anything much, but at least it is a start."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza great service.  Neighborhood feel. Buffalo pizza is awesome. I've used it for most of my kids birthdays and they both ask for it by name."}
{"text":"This place has got great food for a very low price. Also the seats are extremely comfortable. The guy who runs the place is hilarious and has a great deadpan style of humor that I didn't get at first. He will customize a lot of the menu in front of you (I had a friend who asked for a chicken and spinache calzone, and he cut open the calzone and added fresh spinache right there and threw it in the over for a few mins) Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"this is the ONLY pizza place i go to just because the pizza is delicious. The crust is thin, the cheese isnt TOO cheesy or oily to the point where i can feel myself getting fat and unhealthy (which is how i feel at other pizza places).

Ive taken some slices home because i couldnt finish and even after theyre cold, i just pop it back into the oven for about 10 minutes and it tastes even better.. who said leftovers suck? 

Stevie's has affordable prices which makes me love this little pizza parlor even more and im pretty sure they make the peppers from scratch (the ones that most pizza places have packets of). it has a punch of spice and i can tell its real rather than those lame ones u get from costco -_- Love Stevie's, a favorite place"}
{"text":"Probably the best NY style pizza I have had in AZ we got 1/2 cheese & 1/2 cheese mushrooms. We will definitely be back for the pizza"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and Italian food. Great for take out. I am from the east coast and this place reminds me of home. Thin crust is awesome. And great grinders! Best in the area."}
{"text":"I have problems with ordering delivery..being that my order is wrong and typically missing stuff. I used to like the pizza but for some reason lately it seems bland if not undercooked like the cheese is really white...I always have to put it in the oven for a few more minutes."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars?? We ordered the house salad which was mediocre at best, boring and bland, the ranch wasn't very good either. It came with 3 garlic knots that practically had no flavor at all, weird. We also had 2 cheese slices, 1 Hawaiian and 1 pepperoni, the pizza was ok but definitely not 4.5 stars. I give this place 2.5 stars on a good day. Times Square Pizzeria on Deer Valley is a thousand times better than this place."}
{"text":"Man this place is the BEES KNEES. Amazing food across the board. Pizza/wings/garlic knots/stromboli..you name it! I've been going to Stevies for over 3 years now and it still remains my favorite pizza spot. Their customer service is always top notch, they always make you feel welcome; that's part of the reason I always dine in. Give em' a shot!"}
{"text":"Not impressed to say the least. We had the salad pizza and the spinach pizzas. Very skimpy on the sauce and cheese. Tasted like the dough was baked earlier and reheated after you decided on toppings. Would not go back."}
{"text":"EXACTLY the flavor I wanted.

I have been yearning for real calzone for a couple of years now. Every one I've had has been so-so; and then tonight, we tried Stevie's.

Wow.

WOW.

Perfect mozzarella and ricotta balance, and the garlic/olive oil combo made this a delight for the nose AND the tongue.

My husband had the sausage pizza, and he says it is \"sausage pizza perfection.\" 

I'll be honest; we're pizza snobs. (Numerous dates in Manhattan will do that.) This place we're definitely visiting again."}
{"text":"My 100th review goes to PIZZA! I would totally be content with solely pizza as my last meal on earth. This is the perfect place for getting pizza by the slice. It starts out with $1.85 for a cheese pizza, and each additional topping is an extra $.50. They have 10+ different toppings available, which keeps it interesting. I had a slice of pepperoni sausage, a classic, that was delicious. The crust was thin and crispy to my liking. My boyfriend added pineapple, pepperoni, meatball, and anchovies to his slice and thoroughly enjoyed it. Cowabunga, dude! All the pizzas are freshly made, so expect to wait at least 15 mins to account for the prepping and baking. If you're planning a party or movie night, you can purchase whole pizzas that come in medium, large, and giant sizes.  I recommend getting the garlic knots as an appetizer. They are yum yum, especially when dipped in that tomato sauce.

I saw other guests eating buffalo wings and pasta while dining in, and their tempting meals did not help my hunger pangs as I patiently waited for my pizza. There were beautiful paintings of New York on the wall, and two TV's for viewing entertainment. They do offer lunch specials that is written on the chalk board by the counter. 

The service was excellent - friendly, fast, and welcoming. No waiter service. You basically order first, and find your own seats. I plan on returning for more pizza, and try their sandwiches, salads, and calzones."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try Stevie's after seeing reviews and was hopeful it would be the best I have been looking for for oh so long. Sadly, the search will continue. Do not get me wrong, it was not bad. It just was not great. I placed phone  order for one gigantic cheese and one gigantic pepperoni with ricotta. I was so glad to see they offered ricotta since many pizza places do not. I picked up pizzas and the staff was very friendly. Once home, I found both pizzas had pepperoni. Not a big deal, kiddos just put them on my pizza. As for the pizzas, they tasted fine. The crust was thin and there was little grease. The issue I had was it just seemed like the pizzas lacked bold flavor. My yelping wife concurred and we both agreed that we have had better. I really wanted to love the pizzas but the love spark was just not there. My search for the perfect pizza will have to continue."}
{"text":"My son and I traveled to the Phoenix area for the weekend and stopped at Steve's on our way to the hotel. They were getting ready to close when we arrived but were very accomodating. We had pizza and chicken parmesan - both very good."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!

Pizza - AWESOME

Wings - Freaking Awesome

Greek Salad and Pasta - well, my dogs at those - didn't like those very much. 

Everything else is PERFECT! Even the driver was fantastic! 

Great job you guys! Made me and my family really happy"}
{"text":"Was looking for somewhere to eat in the area at this time. I made a great decision by going to this place. Very nice family, excellent service and amazing food. I highly recommend this place to anyone local. GREAT FAMILY BUSINESS"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Got 1/2 buffalo and 1/2 Philly... Both really good. The Philly was the favorite of the two and the buffalo was good for a slice. But that Philly I could eat all day. The crust was perfectly thin and airy. When we come back to Glendale we will look forward to another pizza from here."}
{"text":"In the 12 years I've lived in AZ, this is the best NY style pizza I've found. The sauce sets them apart from their competitors. It is delicious!"}
{"text":"First timers tonight,  food was absolutely fresh and delicious.  Got the broccoli and chicken pasta,  plus sausage and parmagian sandwich.  Pasta came with salad and knots.  Dressing for salad tasted pretty fresh.  Can't believe we didn't come here long time ago :-) 
Service was great too.  Fast and courteous. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza! always the best....just like New York pizza, the crust is always just the way I like it!"}
{"text":"Hey I can't complain...they have a lot of choices. I think they are really good. I would recommend them."}
{"text":"Still searching for the best pizza in the area...please point me in the right direction.   This place is good but nothing I would go out of my way to eat.  Eat it there because it gets cold before you can get it home.  Thin New York style.  Great spicy peperon, ok cheese crust has a good chew to it.  Might grab a slice for lunch but not a whole pie."}
{"text":"First time here and the pizza and garlic rolls were unbelievable. Definitely our go to pizza joint!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and salads. Love the garlic knots that come with the salads too. Always happy with our food. Best pizza in the area, and they deliver too!"}
{"text":"They dont fix their mistakes and make up policies. Gave them an opportunity to make it right and didnt want to. They lost a customer, which I guess they can afford."}
{"text":"Well, I got some advice from a fellow yelped and he said to try Stevie's Pizza after he read my review on Taste Of Italy and their pizza. So, sure I was skeptical and it's because I am from New York and there is a certain way I like my pizza. Call me pickey, that's fine.

Anyway, I went there today. I will say first off the outside of the place reminded me of the many pizza parlors I remember growing up. Once I opened the door I immediately smelled garlic which was another good sign. I looked at the slices in the display case and boy, they looked like what I am used to, thin crust and simple. 

The people there had east coast accents which again was just like home and when I tried the pizza the first thing I said to the guy was \"dead on brother\" the pizza at this point has taken over first place so far. Very very good pizza 5 frikken stars and I'm  goin back boys!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 5 stars!!!
I'm a sucker for pizza and thin crust pizza.
So we ordered about 6 pies one night.
And I have to say it was tasty and filling but the one thing I can't stand is a soggy pie!!! I want my pizza crisp on the bottom and not all doughy.
Maybe next time we order we'll have to ask for it we'll done or something.
But we shall order again because this place is local and pretty tasty"}
{"text":"We had the White Pizza. It was amazing! Garlic knots were good. The side of meatballs was a good amount."}
{"text":"Great pizza crust is crispy and thin, fast service would recommend."}
{"text":"Another great pizza place in Phoenix. No need for franchise, big name pizza shops when we have such great Mom and Pop shops like Stevie's. Excellent crust, sauce and toppings. Real NY style and certainly worth the reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza.  Great Service.   Everything is fresh and delicious.  Great for the family.   Family owned.  Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings, but the best part was the cashier was VERY friendly and accommodating to our kids. Didn't charge us for the kid cup and brought out a garlic knot for my 2 year old. Not sure if this is standard or just came on a good day, but they just earned repeat business from me."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from NYC and we thought the pizza, subs and pasta were fantastic!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Stevie's is perfectly fine pizza if you need a quick fix. However, with all of the neighborhood pizza joints in the surrounding area, I can't say that they'd be at the top of my list of places I'd visit regularly.

Stevie's specializes in New York style pizza, which you can order either by the slice or as a whole pie. They also offer your usual calzones, salads, wings, and pretty much everything that you'd expect at a place like this. Sadly, there are similar pizza places found on every block that aren't really all too different than what's found here.

My girlfriend and I stopped by for a couple of pepperoni slices, as well as six of their garlic knots. Prices are definitely reasonable, so that you should make most people happy. And the food itself was by no means awful, it's just kind of underwhelming.

In comparison to what I've had recently, they seem to be just running through the motions. Crust is standard, sauce and cheese were present, although not really stood out to me as having, as another reviewer put it, a \"bold flavor.\" Realistically, pizza of this caliber is very easy to duplicate.

My rating hovers somewhere in the 2-3-star range. There's nothing overtly wrong with the food, but this isn't quite what I find myself craving when it comes to New York-style pizza.

Fine for the locals, but I think I'll detour a little further out of my way to obtain something superior."}
{"text":"Tonight we got a large white pizza and a 20 count medium wings. This is my first experience ordering from here.

Pizza was slightly on the bland side. Could have had more flavor. Crust was the best part and had an excellent texture.

Medium wings were fried and had a great texture and were cooked really well. I had about 5 of them and the spice built up to a really decent level. I would say on the spicy side of medium. If you are susceptible to spicy food, I would recommend ordering mild.

Overall 3/5. I wasn't blown away by anything I had but it was solid and I would go back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place!  When it's my son's birthday, we always let him pick what he wants and he always wants Stevie's. Today when we picked up the pizzas, they left him a super sweet message on the boxes. Totally made his day!!  Thanks for the yummy pizza and making his dad so special!!!"}
{"text":"Steve's makes a great pizza, but their service is definitely lacking.  There's nothing like ordering a delicious Philly Cheese pizza only to show up and receive a plain cheese.  The guy behind the counter just looks at you like you're an idiot, doesn't try to even apologize, rings you up, and tosses you your pizza.

They get a B+ for the pizza and a D for service."}
{"text":"I went to this place when I got my first job a long time ago, it's been years since my first visit and all I can say is it's been the same since my first slice but in a good way. This is one of those places that if they change the way they make the pizza it'll ruin it. This place has been doing pizza right from the beginning and you'd be crazy not to try there pizza and surprisingly this is one of the few places in az that makes wings better if not the same as wing stop. If you want good wings screw buffalo wilds wings chewy under cooked wings, come here for the best pizza and wings. Trust me if they start to suck I'll change this review and as of 8/11/17 this place is the best, and my first slice was back in roughly 2008 o might be off by a year it's still just as good :)"}
{"text":"Very clean place.  Ordered some garlic cheese bread that was brought to our table.  It was yummy and enough for 2-4 people.  Pizza was excellent with a great crust.

Very nice service with recommendations.  We will return!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  

Every single time, my pizza is cooked perfectly, exactly the way I want it, and it's done the right way!

High-quality ingredients all the way through.  Toppings are delicious, many of them made in-house.  The cheese is real, high-quality, delicious cheese, not that cheap crap they use at the chains.  Stevies is all about high-quality pizza.

It reminds me of all the best things about NY city pizza.
Every bite brings back so many fond memories of days gone by.
The flavor reminds me of how delicious pizza was when I was a kid before all the chains started taking over.

Thank you Stevies for taking care of us one pizza at a time!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and Italian food. I like that I can order on Grub Hub! fast service too."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've had since living in New York state! Their wings are awesome too! Probably gonna be mine and my husband's favorite pizza spot now! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered take out- we had a coupon but didn't read about not being able to use it with any other offers so ended up not being able to use it. The manager gave us a free two liter bottle of soda though which was super nice.
The pizza & wings were delicious! Will definitely start coming here more often"}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. 20 wings is  $12.95. That's a smoking deal. With a large pepperoni pizza came out to $26 out the door. But we stayed in the door. Watched soccer sitting in their comfortable racing style seating. Dude was In such a good mood when Greece scored he brought out some complimentary garlic knots."}
{"text":"They have a really good combo sub. But I personally would skip the Italian dressing and opt for a vinegar and oil mix. Cheers!"}
{"text":"CHICKEN FRANCESE. They have it. I can't believe it. 3 yrs hunting for chicken francese in Phoenix, and we find it in this tiny little pizzeria!
A definite real pizzeria feel..simple presentation, gruff service, good food.
What more do we need?!
Generous portions and great prices.
I didn't try the pizza but the chicken francese I had was great along with penne and vodka sauce my husband had were flavorful.
The garlic knots were super too."}
{"text":"Love our weekly usual, 18 inch pizza with pepperoni & 20 mild wings extra crispy!  Very good pizza!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best pizza I have had since moving here 3 months ago. From Long Island, N.Y."}
{"text":"I always get wings and their antipasto salad and both are always delicious and much better than the typical pizza chains around"}
{"text":"Love Stevie's white pizza. 

Probably my favorite white pizza around. 

Wings are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza! And pasta! And garlic knots! It's all amazing. I prefer to go in and get pizza by the slice because it's crispier and just the way I like it. It's family owned and it shows, they are proud of their work. So kind and so yummy!"}
{"text":"Still on the hunt for THE best pizza in Phoenix, but Stevie's is a hit!

We loved the thin crust, not doughy but still foldable NY Style.
Sauce was tasty, hint of garlic -- nice!
Cheese was plentiful, not too greasy.
Pepperoni was spicy but not too much.

We bought the HUGE pizza and ate it all on a Sunday afternoon (VERY rare for the 3 of us).  Even my daughter ate two slices and loved it (usually she loves the ones my husband and I don't and vice versa).  My husband is also a fan and so am I.

He even gave us a free soda while we sat and waited (he may have suspected it was our first time).

Thanks to Stevie's, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try a different pizza place after getting tired of taking the kids to Chucky Cheese, Peter Piper or Barro's.  We've seen this place many times, but never really stopped to try it out until last night.  Place is small and a bit cozy.  We would have sat a bigger booth, but the tables were dirty with dishes and stuff.  We ordered their giant pizza and 20 wings special.  I got half pepperoni and half sausage.  We got our wings served first and they were awesome!  My wife and I prefer a little bit of crispness to the wings and these delivered.  The sauce was mild (for our kids), but it was still incredibly good.  My kids loved it.  Shortly after, we got our pizza, nice and hot.  The crust was thin, but absolutely delicious.  My daughter complained that the pepperoni was too greasy, but honestly, it's pepperoni, it's going to always be greasy.  The sausage side tasted great and we all ate very well.  When they were preparing our pizza, the guy who made the pizza asked me if I wanted to cut it into smaller slices for my kids, which I thought was a nice personal touch that he didn't have to do.  I noticed that a lot of people were calling in their orders and they were told it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait.  I think the minimal staff makes it a little harder to get those orders out in a hurry.  Just something to consider for you folks that like to get delivery."}
{"text":"Pizza was very greasy making the crust very soft. Service was average. Probably won't be back. There is a really good pizza place just on the otherwise of 59th ave."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza; delicious sauce. Barbecue wings were on point. Friendly customer service, definitely ordering there again"}
{"text":"Decided to try some new pizza last night and we now wish that we had stuck with our usuals.  Ordered delivery for a cheese pizza with half sausage.  The delivery was super fast, like 25 minutes but I wasn't happy with the results.  First of all, the delivery driver didn't have any change on him so that was annoying.  Then I looked at the pizza and it looked half cooked.  I like my pizza well done and this pizza wasn't even done!  The mozz. wasn't even fully melted in some places.  The sliced sausage was yucky too, it had a rubbery texture to it.  I don't recommend this pizza, it's bunk."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Had a large cheese and a spinach pizza. Seriously, might have been the best spinach pizza I've ever had!! Can't wait to get it again. Delivery was fast and the prices are good."}
{"text":"Take out order of hot meatball sub and steak/cheese sub.  Meatball was 5 stars; steak/cheese 3 stars.  Very pleasant family run business."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before but after my last experience, this will probably be my go to pizza place from now on!  Conveniently located across from Midwestern university, the hubby and I decided to order some appetizers and grab some slices.  I love that they let you order cheese pizza by the slice and pick additional toppings. They even pop it back in the oven for you to get the cheese all gooey again, yum. We called in our order about 45 minutes to closing and the person on the phone (owner?) said they only had one slice left. We contemplated ordering a whole pizza but the owner said he didn't mind baking a few more slices for us since it'd be less costly for us. When we got there he ended up giving us the whole pizza since it was so close to closing time and he would probably just end up tossing the rest! Talk about awesome customer service! 

As for the pizza itself, we got the meatball, mushroom, onion and garlic toppings. We don't eat pork so its nice to have another meat option on the menu since the meatballs are made of beef. The meatballs are thinly sliced and added to the pizza, kind of like gyro meat. We ordered the garlic knots and appetizer sampler with the mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini, and mushrooms. Loved the mozzarella sticks and zucchini, the batter it really light and not too oily. Didn't care for the mushrooms, they tasted like they were previously canned. The garlic knots weren't bad but they were more like buns and weren't garlicky enough for us haha. Appies came with ranch and marinara.

Good prices and portions, excellent customer service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza! And I'm in town from Chicago! The crust, sauce, and cheese are great. 

(I'm surprised Yelp allowed the \"smoking driver\" review to post, since this reviewer isn't a customer and admits to never having tried the food!)"}
{"text":"Stevies, Barros and Rays are my top 3 picks
On the west side. Quick service and friendly staff. Sometimes Barros doesn't answer the phone. Never had a problem at Stevies. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza and wings special from here a few days ago. The guys in the store were great. But we couldn't say quite the same for the food. Both the pizza and the wings were just missing that last little bit of flavor. Overall everything seemed a little bland. We'll probably be back to try one more time, as we always like to give a place at least 2 shots. But if the second time is similar to the first, we may still be on the hunt for a new pizza place."}
{"text":"Nice quiet little lunch with my babes was just perfect here.  I was looking for a sit down pizza spot with my little ones for Mothers Day, this was perfect.  The pizza was fresh and hot, and absolutely delish! Big hit with the kids too"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Tried this pizza for the first time tonight and it was shockingly bad. Very soggy and watery sauce with close to raw crust in center...I did not call to complain but will not order again"}
{"text":"The BEST Pizza restaurant in the area, & it's not even close. Just as important as the quality food, the customer service is EXCELLENT, the customer service should have a 5/5 star rating in itself. My family & I live North of Stevie's & i will gladly bypass the 3 closer places & we will only go to Stevie's for local pizza joint type food."}
{"text":"Great pizza, hoagies and more! I'm pretty picky and this place hits all points. You walk in feeling like you're  in Jersey :) staff is really great! The grandma Pizza is a must try!"}
{"text":"This family owned and operated place, Stevie's Pizza, is serving up some amazingly good pizza, calzones, pastas, and more.  Their thin NY style crust is golden brown on the outside yet moist and chewy inside.  Sauce has just the right tomato sweetness and the mozz is without a doubt some high grade stuff.  Nice lunch combo of 2 slices & soda for about $5.  Nice clean, small and simple decor.  Great place to get in, get your slice, and get on with your day.  

Location is on the NW corner of 59th Ave. & the 101 in the big FRY's shopping area, and over by Rubio's & a vet office.  This is the old Papa John's location that went out of business."}
{"text":"Not great, just ok.  Zucchini didnt have alot of taste and tried a cheese pizza and it was the same."}
{"text":"Ate this for the first time last night. Only tried the pizza tho. We ordered delivery and it was great! We got a large pepperoni with half jalapeño. The crust is thin but not too thin, there is still a good amount of crust to eat but not super bread-y like Barros pizza for example. No over abundance of sauce either. The perfect amount of everything. Would love to eat it there and to order more off the menu!"}
{"text":"More accurately, this is a 2 1/2 star max establishment. The place is filthy. The backs of the benches are covered in grime. The bathroom is disgusting. I had to clean it myself before using it. I admittedly did not ask them to clean it, because I needed to use it. The food took a long time to come out and we were the only ones in the restaurant. One slice of pizza had a large hair imbedded it the cheese, which is odd, because both cooks were men with shorter hair. The cheese sticks were good, the fried zucchini and mushrooms, not so much. They were soaked in grease. The pizza was not good. Soggy chewy crust is not New York pizza. The meatballs in my sandwich were bland and lacking in numbers. With a little garlic powder, salt and pepper, I made it tasty enough to finish. The staff seems un personable. They are there, but not much more. I won't come back. You yelpers  that gave this place 4 1/2 stars are nuts."}
{"text":"Our Holy Grail has always been to find decent pizza in AZ. We read a lot of places that say \"New York Style\" but it is far from it. Yelp was a big help when we happened upon this listing, as it's not in our neighborhood. The pictures sold us to give it a try. 

The place was clean and had enough seats to comfortably sit for a \"to go\" type of pizza place. We noted to the staff that we were excited to try their pizza and come to find out that Joe is from our neck of the woods in New Jersey...so he knows what we're looking for. 

Our \"usual\" pie is pepperoni and meatball with mushrooms added to one half (my boyfriend's half, not mine!). We were not disappointed. You could tell that it was good cheese and pepperoni because it was not swimming in oil. The crust was crispy and tasted good; you know it's good if there is no crust left on the tray. 

We will definitely be back; I want to try their Eggplant Rollatini (made in house) and my boyfriend wants to check out the chicken parm. 

Tonight our search ended!!!!"}
{"text":"Love Stevie's pizza! we order from this place on a regular basis. 
Best pies I've found in Arizona so far...and by a large margin, and their pies crust is done just right.
The bite sized garlic bread is also fantastic, real garlic pieces, moist with just a slight crunch. 
Their giant sized pizza is enough to feed even the hungriest of children, plus the adults to boot."}
