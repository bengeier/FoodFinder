{"text":"New York style pizza made by Sal himself. You can tell he's been doing this for decades. Keep it simple and grab up a large cheese pizza for under $10. Take time to say hi to Sal. He would be delighted to meet you and appears genuinely grateful for your business. If you like Villa Pizza you'll likely love Sal's. They add a little more cheese than Villa and your check will be a fraction of the cost. Can't really beat that! Give it a whirl the next time you're jonesin' for a good pie ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered one of the family specials. Was very pleased with the entire meal, the pie was great as was the salad and wings. The folks here are real nice and polite. Was our first time. But will definitely be back for more. Thanks you Sal's !"}
{"text":"Its okay, I was not really sold on the whole idea that their pizza is similar to that of the quality of pizza from back east.  And I also don't know why they insist on giving ranch with every order."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, I am always skeptical about \"NY style pizza\", but everything from the Eggplant parm sandwich to the 2 pizza we ordered ( white and regular) exceeded our expectations!!!  Very obliging to special requests (no sauce on the sandwich or garlic on the white pizza).  Extremely friendly delivery person.  Right on time and hot!!!

This was our first time ordering and it definitely won't be our last!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Las Vegas yet. Very similar to a New York pie. Their ranch is amazing as well. Ordered delivery in the last week or 2, it came on time piping hot and delivered by a very nice gentleman who was kind to my son and wished me a happy mothers day. From service to slice this place is a keeper! Will be ordering again today since I have a house of hungry boys!"}
{"text":"So the boys and I decided to go to sal's for a little sunday dinner. After looking at the online menu I decided to get a salad and the bruschetta. I walk in and ask how much the salad is, the stoner behind the counter had no clue. I then asked if they even sold salad, couldn't even answer that. Finally, I order a slice of pepperoni za and a caesar salad. My friend ordered a pizza pie ahead of time and while I was waiting for my order he received his pie at the table. Preoccupied in their cannabis filled daze, they forgot to charge him. Now onto the food portion of the review. The za was cold and barely had any sauce. It was clearly no better than a 4.8 out of 10. The salad was great if you only like lettuce and parm on your caesar salad. Overall this place probably only stays in business because of all the drunk kids coming by on the weekends."}
{"text":"I got this delivered because I got a flier for it and it seemed to have pretty good reviews on Yelp. I was very disappointed. This is very subpar, sub-replacement-level pizza (replacement level being Papa Johns or other national chain). The pizza is very wet, covered in a layer of grease. Getting past the grease the pizza doesn't taste good either.

Sixth months later I completely forgot about my experience and got another flier, looked at the reviews again and ordered Sal's again. But I immediately recognized the liquid pizza and saw my mistake."}
{"text":"Came to find New York Style pizza and was not disappointed.  Really good pizza and the service was great. Mary, the cashier, was super friendly and her recommendations were on point. Their weekly discount is the best. 2 slices of pizza and a drink for 4.99. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This pizza is great but the customer service is for the birds. I called to ask about the specials and steve answered and asked me what kind of specials i was looking for instead of just telling me the specials. I hung up and called pizza hut. They tell you the specials before they pick up the phone. In this day and age you better get your customer service down with training or your in big trouble. Sorry sal i do love your pizza."}
{"text":"I recently moved back to the East Valley (Tempe) not too long ago & had since been searching for a good pizza joint close to where I live. One evening, I found Sal's Pizza as I was walking around my new neighborhood & decided to stop in, since I have a serious weakness for 'New York'-style pizza. I ordered a 'combo' slice (I was informed as I was placing my order that one slice of pizza at Sal's is actually one 1/4 of a whole 19\" inch pie) & a drink (the only fountain drink cup size they offer is 20 oz. though - what gives, Sal?). 

     My food was delivered to me at my table piping-hot, & I was pleasantly surprised to see that the 'slice' took two standard paper plates to contain it all! I was politely offered glass shakers of parmesan cheese & hot pepper flakes & then I dug in. The sourdough, hand stretched pizza crust was thin, crispy & chewy, the sauce & cheese were both delicious, & my slice was smothered with pepperoni, green peppers, onions & black olive goodness!

     I've been back to Sal's numerous times since my initial visit, & the pizza has been consistently good, every time! I've only eaten the pizza at Sal's, but they do have other pizza joint menu standards, such as calzones, salads, desserts & such. Warning - there's only one restroom for both men & women to share, so if it's crowded in the restaurant & you've got to go badly, you may be in for an uncomfortable wait to use the facilities. The front windows in the tiny dining area face out to Apache Blvd. for decent people-watching opportunities while you eat! 

     The staff working here are primarily college kids, & they enjoy cranking up the restaurants sound system, but, no big deal. There's one flat-screen TV mounted on the wall (which was tuned into a sporting event every time I've been in there). They also have a huge, upright, old school 'Big Game Hunter' video game in there to the right of the main doorway, which seems out of place to me, considering the usable floor space they're working with in there. 

     Sal's does offer delivery as well, but only after 5pm or so, from what I was told by the counter staff. This is seriously 'wicked good' pizza at an inexpensive price, & definitely my new favorite 'go-to' local pizza joint here in Tempe!"}
{"text":"We went 2 weeks ago. Picked up pizza to take home. Loved the pizza! The staff is very friendly. We're going again tonight. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"The cheese pizza was excellent, but the cannolis were atrocious. Although listed as plain, they tasted as if someone poured a jar of cinnamon on them. They were inedible. Pretty tough to achieve with a cannoli."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quality pizza, this is the place to go. Every time I've gone in I see Sal working in the kitchen. They do sell pizza by the slice if you're looking to try a couple different styles. You really can't go wrong with their pizza. I would recommend trying the rigatoni pizza at least once. Have brought family and friends to this place and we enjoy it every time. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"It took about 15 minutes to get my food and when I asked about my order they made me show them my bank account to get my food because they didn't believe I ordered food"}
{"text":"Awesome NY style pizza. Their stromboli's are the bomb too. They recently parted ways with the Villa franchise name. The are now called Sal's pizza."}
{"text":"Delivered me a burned to a crisp pizza I will never order from here again. Show a lack of quality control and willingness to deliver a sub par product."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I love Villa Pizza.  I have lived in the Las Vegas Valley for 15 years and I grew up eating it, as my family is from the East Coast and we are way picky about our pizza.  So, that being said, my review is simply for this particular location, and not the Villa Pizza franchise as a whole (which, btw, this place recently changed its name to \"Sal's pizza\", so that makes me feel a bit better about writing this).  If you want to experience some of the best pizza in the Valley, try it out.  Just don't go to this location.

I ate here the first day that I moved to Henderson, and, due to the reasons above, was thrilled to live walking distance near a Villa pizza.  However, I was less than thrilled to discover that it is connected to a gas station.  We had been moving all day and we were starving, though, so no matter.  The cashier was okay, and the menu was typical of the chain. 

Upon sitting down to wait for our pizza, my friends yelped, as they spotted a huge roach.  I went up to tell the cashier, only to be met with annoyance rather than any kind of apology.  Grossed out by this, we switched to another table in the center of the restaurant.  As we were eating, not ONE, but TWO roaches resurfaced.  I went to the cashier again, and she sent out a guy from the back who chased them around... as we were eating our pizza, looking on in horror.  As this is happening, I hear \"Sal\" in the back hacking up a lung as he's cooking pizza.  Despite the fact that the pizza was good (as is typical of the chain), I was so disgusted by everything else that I just about put down my food and walked out.  I will never, ever dine here again due to fears about cleanliness, and I don't think I've ever had to do that with a restaurant here in Vegas.  Someone needs to get the health department in there, stat.  Diners, beware."}
{"text":"So me and my Boy Doyle go to Sal's for lunch one day.  We get inside and we're like 'oh my god is that a 19'' pizza for TEN BUCKS? Oh no,' so we order it.  And what do we do?  WE DESTROY IT.  Ate the whole thing.  But all in all, it wasn't great, but i mean it was a ton of food for $10.  Sauce could be a lot better.  The guy working there was legit."}
{"text":"Sals Pizza is very very delicious! Always satisfied!! Even though it takes a long time to cook, it is totally worth it! Even the chicken fingers are made by hand (meaning it's not frozen)! I highly highly recommend this place!!!! True authentic Italian food!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, back when it first opened and when it used to be Villa pizza, and the pizza has stayed the same. Sal hasn't changed it at all. It's amazing! A bit out of the way from where I live now, but it's absolutely worth it. I don't go anywhere else for pizza! I go all the time, too. At least once a week. Prices are good, the service is friendly, and I even got Sal to smile at me a few times. 

And now I kind of wish I didn't have work today so I could go get Sal's."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. While it use to be a Villa Pizza, it hasn't lost any of it's old great taste. In fact, it has gotten better. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Yes, it's connected to a gas station, but that doesn't take away from the fact that they make up for it in quality. Being a small business owner you take what you can get with your location and to me it doesn't make any negative impact on my decision to eat there.

Their lunch specials are fantastic for grabbing a bite to eat during your lunch hour. It's unbeatable for price and quality.

Thank you Sal and crew for your dedication to the community."}
{"text":"Sal has been serving great pizza here for decades. The pies are consistently great- we recommend Sal's to all our neighbors and they are never disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to this place to order my food and a server guy named Pedro was so Rude !! Never comeback to this place again !!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever eaten!  I love that's it served by the slice ~ the size of ONE slice of Sal's Pizza is the size of TWO regular  pizza slices. It's hard for me to eat one slice it's so big. The crust is thin and crispy with THICK edges ~ talk about the best possible combination!  My personal farovite favor is garlic and tomato. 

I have to STOP going for a while ~ I feel quite addicted and my pants are fitting tighter.  I have watched the movie ' Eat, Pray, Love'  three times just to watch Julia Roberts eat a pizza that she absolutely loves ~ she looks the way I feel when I eat Sal's Pizza. 

Bottomline: I LOVE the pizza, I PRAY I don't gain tooooo much more weight as I continue to EAT the best pizza ever. 

Blessings to the franchise owner ~ the owner and staff are friendly. The facility is very clean and the price is ridiculously cheap. 

:) KC"}
{"text":"Do not waste time and money on this horrible place. I ordered a pizza and a Greek salad for delivery. The pizza was burnt and the salad that was supposed to be topped with feta, olives, peppers..., was just a tin full of lettuce.
I called to give the place the opportunity to deliver what I paid for, but the so called manager could care less. He said, \"You'll have to take that up with Grub Hub.\" Grub Hub is the service I ordered from. The manager went on to say that he is busy and can't talk to me. I am so disgusted with the entire experience. I will never order from that Sal's again."}
{"text":"They have really good pizza!! They also have the BEST homade ranch dressing! This place gets an A+ :)  Also they are very kind, great customer service when we go in to eat lunch. check out the lunch special, HUGE slices of pizza!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this location I always have two slices of cheese pizza. One of the most rewarding things to consume! The pizzas are very good here. For me, the flavor of the sauce is just right and they know the exact ratio of cheese to sauce when the make their pies. I personally like reheating the cheese pizzas in the oven (NO MICROWAVE) because the dough gets a bit crispier. Great texture.They have other stuff on the menu but I just stick to what makes me happy. Two slices of cheese sit back, relax and eat it as fast as you can before it gets cold."}
{"text":"I am so glad that we found this place . We absolutely love the pizza and fingers !!! I am so crazy over Dads Potato Salad ! Super yummy !! Highly recommended .... We have been coming here for quite some time and will continue to !!"}
{"text":"Sal's is the real deal. Even if you're not from New York you'll love their menu!!  Yes, you might pay a tad more but it's completely worth it. The service is always perfect-and I'm picky when it comes to good customer service!  Thanks for being somewhere that my WHOLE family of picky Italians can agree on!!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed that our nearby Rosati's at Wigwam and Pecos closed, so thought I'd try Sal's.  The disappointment only increased.  I asked for a thin-crust pizza, and they acted as if they had never made one before.  The pizza was greasy, the sausage not very tasty.  The next day (my favorite for leftover pizza), the pizza was inedible-- greasy and soggy.  Never going back"}
{"text":"I love me a giant slice of pizza.  One of those slices that is fit for folding like I was in New York City.  Oddly enough Sal's is based out of Boston!

The slices are 1/4 of a 19\" pie.  They offer the standards as well as a few specialties and \"Salzones\". 

Sal's delivers the goods.  I was very impressed with my pepperoni slice.  The pizza is good and they are open late which is a Godsend for me."}
{"text":"This pizza is so bomb. The authenticity flowing out of this pizza joint makes me want to come back over and over. The service is top notch too. I came here my first time and 2 weeks later came again and the lady who took my order even remembered what I got the last time exactly how I liked it. She honestly blew me away. The pizza here is so great and the 4.99 deal is perfectly perfect for one person! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Came in to Sal's Pizza today which is usually in my every few week rotation of pizza lunch hot spots in Henderson. I ordered the 2 slice lunch special cheese only and a side of ranch (homemade). It runs 4.99 for the lunch special which includes a 20 ounce drink and 90cents extra for the ranch which is more than enough for 2 slices. The slices were fresh and hot and up to New York standard. From Brooklyn, it's hard to find decent pizza out here in Las Vegas and Henderson. I felt that every time have dined in or ordered take out from Sal's I've never been disappointed. On a good day you will still catch the old man throwing dough in the window. He may have sold but his legacy lives on and he still works. Sal's pizza isn't just a lonely pizzeria in a gas station, it's a hidden gem. When I order take out and bring it back to work people want to know where I went for my pizza- I just tell them Sal's Pizza. 4.99 lunch special can't be beat.  

-long time loyal customer"}
{"text":"Solid New York style pizza. The crust is cooked perfectly, not soggy but not like a cracker either. The best part of the pie is that even when you have meat toppings, it's not overly salty. The sauce has a subtle sweetness to it but it's nice. The sausage and peppers sandwich is also very good and filling. I only had it delivered so I can't say much about dining in but it's attached to the corner gas station so it's probably not good for large parties. All around a great neighbor pizza joint."}
{"text":"Sal is the pizza king. Thin pie, great wings,super clean, and EXCELLENT service.  The plain cheese pie is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pizza is always sitting out for a long time before you order it, staff is rude and seems stoned constantly."}
{"text":"Great pie, hands down the closest to \"East Coast\" I have eaten in the area.  Keep up the bread making traditions!"}
{"text":"Sal's is absolutely delicious in every way!  Our family has been customers here for years!  Everything is made to perfection.  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  We love this place!!!! Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Sal's.  I'm from the Northeast where we live on pizza and this place would fit right in.

Food - 5 stars - pizza was excellent, NY/NJ/CT quality
Price - 5 stars - first reasonable prices I've found out west on good NY pizza slices
Speed - 5 stars - service was very quick
Staff - 5 stars - the gentleman who helped me was friendly, genuine, helpful, & provide all around excellent service
Menu - 5 stars - they even had strombolis on the menu which are pretty much unheard of out west

I knew this place was legitimate before I even tasted the food based on my interaction with the staff. Struck up a conversation with the gentleman who helped me and he chatted with me as I waited for my food.  It's rare to find that out here and made me feel right at home. Great \"Mom & Pop\" stop."}
{"text":"Best slices and whole pie in Tempe. I've been coming here since it opened. It recently changed owners and things have only gotten better."}
{"text":"There are 2 pizza places I order from depending on my taste buds and this is one of them, however after yesterday I need to write a review. First and for most the pizza is delicious but yesterday I received a pizza not to my liking, like it had been sitting out waiting over a period so it was kind of cold when it arrived. I called and told them and they were awesome about the whole thing and made sure I was taken care of! Thank you Sals!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the area hands down. You have to try the Breakfast Pizza, maple syrup, bacon, waffle crumbles... Recipe for awesomeness. They also mentioned a new one coming out called the Thanksgiving Pizza. Can't wait to try that one. If your looking for authentic east coast pizza this is one you gotta try. Cool thing is if you end up drinking at the Bears Den across the street you can call in your order and they will run it across to you and you never have to leave the bar! Sweet little setup. Cool bartenders, cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Gross greasy pizza. Better pizza at chuck echeese. Bad customer service. Don't waste your time or money here. Yuck"}
{"text":"Sure, it's connected to a gas station but once you've been there, you won't mistake it or miss it again. I had been there a few times before as Sal's does offer a true east coast pizza (yes it's greasy and soggy and friggin' tasty like it should be) but it was a bit pricey,  however this last time,  as I was in 'good' pizza withdrawal,  I noticed the prices were more reasonable.  The chicken fingers are always good,  sizable and well cooked with a pretty good buffalo sauce and their own ranch dressing. The Caesar salad was pretty good and then of course... The Pizza!  I usually don't have a \"doggybag\" if that tells you anything. Definitely worth a look!"}
{"text":"I am totally not a Pizza Lover....really I am not. But....with that being said you know if I Yelp about Pizza,,,its got to be good, right? Sals vegetarian pizza is the best and I do mean the  best vegetarian pizza I have ever eaten!! And Sal actually makes it!! Please do yourself a favor...if you live in the Henderson area ...specifically GV...go see Sal!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to try a new pizza place so we decided on Sal's , we ordered there white pizza with chicken bacon and garlic and when we started eating it , it had a really heavy fish taste and we ended up leaving the entire pizza and just walking out . Something just wasn't right."}
{"text":"If you are from New England and live in the desert now and miss good pizza, look no further than Sal's! Big crust on the edges, thin crust on the bottom, large slices you have to fold in half, yep its all there! I like a plain old school cheese pizza but if your looking for more options they have those too. Best of all is price. $11 for a 19 inch cheese pizza these days is one of the best deals for real pizza."}
{"text":"Personally I love this place ! The pizza is actually good ! The 18' pizza which is HUGE is a decent price in my opinion ! The staff is very friendly and they are close with each other ! There very organized and the environment is very cozy ! I have been going here since they opened and there hasn't been one time where I had horrible experience !"}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is...any fresh pizza hot out of the oven is bound to be good.  What I judge good pizza on is usually the crust, and this one was hard and crunchy, which I didn't really care for.  That being said, it was good because it was hot out of the oven, but I don't really think it stands out from your typical pizza place (to me, anyway)."}
{"text":"This place should be on DDD. Some of the best pizza in Las Vegas and its hidden in a gas station. The crust makes the pizza and if you like ranch on your pizza it's a no brainier best homemade ranch ever!!! Not kidding try it and you won't regret a single calorie."}
{"text":"Good friends from NYC had eaten here and promised me this was the best New York-style pizza in Vegas.  The place is hard to find even using GPS (it is behind the Arco station, attached to the station's convenience store). To call the ambiance casual is being too generous. Austere but very clean. It appears to be set up to do mostly take out business (and while we were there, we were the only eat-in diners. About 8 take-out pick ups came thru in that time).
The folks behind the counter couldn't be nicer, very friendly. They serve a thin crust pizza. One of the pies had the oil dripping off it - very New York.
Maybe I have lost my taste for New York style pizza. I just felt it was very ordinary. The toppings were less than generous. Lot's of better pizza in the area."}
{"text":"I pass Sal's on a daily basis and decided to stop in to check it out. I wasn't really interested in pizza but thought I'd try some pasta. I figured an Italian place would know to to cook some sauce. I was wrong. 

The pasta was way over cooked and not seasoned, or drained, so it left a pool of water in the plate. The sauce was bland and tasted of nothing. I don't understand how you can have marinara completely devoid of flavor, but somehow it happened.

The side salad was just basic tomato, lettuce, red onion, carrot, cucumber, and lettuce.

Maybe the pizza is better, but the pasta sucks.

The blue cheese dressing was decent."}
{"text":"Saturday night...Ordered the family special which came with fries and chicken fingers and the large cheese pizza but opted to pay an extra 2 bucks for the 1 topping. My mom normally doesn't eat the fingers but she tore these up and said they were the best. I have to admit Sal's was well worth it. Don't know why we didn't find this place sooner! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza made by Brooklyn Italians.  They also have a full menu and DR. Browns soda in bottles.  Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I'm one of those unique people that doesn't usually like pizza but Sal's is my only exception! I love the pizza here especially the meatball ricotta, it's to die for. The slices are huge so you definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I've meant to review this place for a long time! The pizza and service is just always so wonderful! I get the small pizza 1/2 pepperoni 1/2 pineapple, and it's always amazing. The crust...I don't know what they do...but it's always crispy on the bottom and fluffy for the crust. I dip my pizza in their home made ranch, it's to die for. I wanted to do a shout out to Ian, the delivery driver, he always says hello to my dog, who loves him. And is always super quick and nice. Also, met the owner when he visited the restaurant I work at, he was super cool, even though his dining experience wasn't great. I'm just blown away with their service and food every time. If I could give them a hundred stars, I would. Already ate a piece before I could take a picture! Keep up the good work guys! Until my next cheat day!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried their pizza, but I do have a thing or two to say about their cannolis!

Going on 10 months, I've had this insatiable craving for a cannoli. The last time I had one was in NYC 3 years ago, so I've been looking for a place that has them. Not like at an actual sit down italian restaurant where I need to buy dinner before I can have one (and there aren't many places with them on the menu), so when I found out Sal's had them, you can imagine how excited I was. Granted they're not as good as the ones in a New York or Boston italian bakery, but they came pretty close. The only downside was that the shell tasted pre-packaged, but the inside was pretty awesome - and it finally satisfied that craving!
Haven't tried the pizza yet, but it looked pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Sals is great New York style pizza. If your in the mood for a greasy, cheesy pizza, Sals is the spot! It looks like a hole in the wall but those places are usually the best. I visit Sals at least once a month. The wings are fantastic as well:)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty pathetic - first of all they are from Boston and as every each coast person knows, Boston does not how to make a pizza pie. They should stick to chowder. Actually, that wasn't even my main issue as I never ordered a giganto slice.         Checking the menu online in my car before entering, I saw that they had a large variety of calzones and \"salzones\" Well after entering and seeing one asian girl texting behind the counter, I asked for a menu which wasn't necessary because this location has only pizza - no salads or subs or anything else. How is this possible that at 8pm, there were just a few paltry slices in the case and no other food at all, despite the large menu online? Sal's is out to lunch and this place is embarrassing. What a joke. Boston pizza...lol."}
{"text":"Talk about a diamond in the rough!  Wrapped in a strip mall next to an arco station sits a quiet looking restaurant that makes some amazing food. 
Sals special.  Great!
Stromboli.  Great!
Meatball sliders.  Really great!!
Chicken parmigiana dinner and sandwich. Great!
Mozzarella sticks.  Good.  
Marinara sauce.  To die for!  
If you want great food, it's simple, eat here.  
Best Italian in Vegas /Henderson."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Wonder girls working here and they are always nice. 
Want a good New York style pizza this is the place.."}
{"text":"This place has probably some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life. I have given this place so much business and the special pie creations are consistently perfect every time. I think it has a lot to do with the type of sauce they are using. I've ventured out to another Villa pizza on Anthem Parkway and  the pizzas are completely different. A little bit pricey for a standard cheese pizza, but nevertheless worth every bite."}
{"text":"This place is 5 stars! Excellent customer service the guy brought us our chicken fingers and also gave us silverware! The chicken fingers were very delicious and crispy !! I do recommend this place for good food and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Always a consistently good pie.  I'm a pizza snob and this place is solid.  They also do good meaty wings, not the little tiny ones some places pass off as wings.
$10 cheese pie is a real value for hand tossed, no conveyor belt, real pizza oven pizza.  They use sliced sausage which I love unlike some joints that have that frozen rabbit pellet junk they pass off as sausage.  If you love sausage, you know what I'm talking about. Great place and attached to an AM/PM so it is very convenient to pick up a few things while you wait.  Always quick and always consistent food. Same guys have been tossing the pies for years.  This is one of those never judge a book by it's cover places because it's located in a gas station.  A real find."}
{"text":"NY Style Pizza all the way!!!! Ordered Large Pizza with knots and just after one slice I am stuffed!!!!! I wish they did deliver to my work but it was no biggie picking it up!!!! I am sooo happy I found a great pizza place!!!!!!! Thank you!!!!! I love that this place is family owned and makes the dough from scratch!!! Mangia!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying sals since they opened a few months ago - I live just a few blocks away.

Grabbed a slice today. It was really disappointing - crust was not fully cooked and there was not nearly enough cheese... several bites were just sauce and doughy crust. Bummer."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the entire world. Honestly. I am not too concerned with reviewing this place on anything besides their pizza- however, their pizza is the BEST in the entire Phoenix area. If I am going to order pizza Sal's is always my go-to."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza. Greasy, cheesy, and $10 for a large. Get it to go and it's still good. The next day I warm it up on medium in a nonstick pan until the crust is stiff to my liking. Then, the best part, I turn the heat down and flip it over until the cheese gets crusty. There are no words for this experience."}
{"text":"Don't do it!  I really really LOVE Sals on the east coast.  I was SO excited to see that there was one here in Tempe. The first time I ordered, some guy who sounded wayyyyyy stoned took my order but got it all wrong for delivery. Charged me for an XL but got a small.  Finally got the right pizza but it was cold. Took a SECOND chance and the same guy delivered me a VERY STALE, cold large pizza.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to rate this place higher but the pizza was awful. No flavor at all, might as well be eating a piece of plastic. The price was good but the product not so much. Clean place, good size eating area."}
{"text":"I ordered at 5:40 and they said it would be 15 minutes. I show up at 6:00 and they say it will be 5 more minutes. A few minutes later they say they just started making the pizza and it will be 15 more minutes. Good pizza but shitty service."}
{"text":"Great pizza for the price. One slice of pizza there is two slices at any other pizza place. The pizza always tastes fresh and slices come out in a matter of minutes. Definitely worth a try if you've never been there before."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Thank goodness they've upheld that Villa Pizza flavor!! The owner is the sweetest man ever and his sons & staff are awesome! Even though I'm a little out of their area, they are always welcome to deliver to me!!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Best cheese pizza ever! Garlic knots are good too! Been coming here for years and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"This is delicious, awesome pizza.  Don't let the fact that it's connected to a gas station fool you, this is good stuff.  The grease/cheese/sauce situation is absolutely perfect.  They only have one size, giant, but you'll want to eat the whole thing on your own, so it's ok.  Trust me, try it once and you'll fall hard.

(Oh, by the way, it's called Sal's Pizza now.  Still the same awesome pizza.)"}
{"text":"I recently moved to area and was looking for some good Pizza slices. And I found them at Sal's. The plain cheese Pizza slices were delicious and just the right amount of crunch on the crust. I will be back"}
{"text":"I think I go here about once a week because of the giant slice and drink deal.  They have a really good New York style pizza and the cheese to sauce ratio is just right.  If you want to make pizza at your own place you can also buy pizza dough there which I think is really cool."}
{"text":"WOW what a find brother Clint.  Brought to our home for the first time. Meat lovers & pepperoni, knots, & salad.  Hot gooey, cheesy, great sauce nummy pizza. Can't wait to try every thing. Num Num"}
{"text":"I came into here two different times and they were out of cheese. The first time I came in they made me the cheese and I just had to wait, the second time he refused to make me a cheese cause he didn't feel like it even though hey had an hour till close...this doesn't make any sense, their pizza is super good so i was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Really icky. The girl who served our pizza was touching all the food with her bare hands and handling money...didn't wash her hands in between. I didn't like the taste of the pizza and only ate about half of mine (slice of pepperoni). Also, it took forever to get my order and pay for it because the employee's drunk friends came in and she got distracted talking to them."}
{"text":"I received a rotten chicken finger and they did not do anything about it told me its fine we just got them delivered today!!!!! NO THANK YOU SALS!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, very  big slices. Guy was nice and had many different pizzas. ill def be going there more often.  Great prices for great food.  May go in today!"}
{"text":"Had a half cheese, half veggie. Great crust & perfect amount of cheese & veggies. Distinctly not \"chain\" like. Reasonably priced & delivery available. Pasta & Italian sandwiches are also on the menu, but I haven't tried them. Small, clean dining area. Each table has a quad set of  mini shakers, red peppers, Parmesan, oregano & what looked like garlic salt. Friendly staff offered excellent service.
I highly recommend, good stuff..."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst pizza and wings we have ever had! And I paid 45$ for a pile of garbage that went rite to the trash! The wings were supposed to be mild and they came hot but there wings had barely any meat on them and what was their was not good meat! The pizza my wife described as rubbery and it was disgusting!  I agree it was terrible!"}
{"text":"I really feel bad for the Yelpers who have reviewed this place with less than 5 stars. I am very sorry...for you and your bad experience. 
Look, this place Sal's pizza has been around for a few years now. It was originally in Chandler (where I first discovered it) ....and me, an East coast girl who is still adapting to the West coast, I would appreciate some good pizza. Sals has the best pizza I have tasted so far in Arizona. Conveniently, Sals moved locations to Tempe so it's closer to me so I'm a happy gal all over again."}
{"text":"That's great that the wings are so fresh it still has the feathers... maybe a little to fresh. 

Bad Pizza, worse wings, Stay away."}
{"text":"We went here a few months ago, because it was another pizzeria that claimed they had \"Authentic New York Pizza\".... Guess they've never been to NY. 

I'm a born and raised New Yorker. We take our pizza seriously. Don't give me some greasy soggy slice of bread and try to call it Pizza. Thanks. 

The staff was nice, and the service was ok. I just can't bring myself to give them more than two stars with such bad food. 

Most of the reviewers are from local Las Vegans, most of which have never experienced NY pizza either.. so take it from me. If you want NY pizza-- don't go here."}
{"text":"Great NY pizza. Service is great also and everyone is super nice. Fast delivery. They also have cheap lunch
 2 slices and drink for $5"}
{"text":"Ok, I ordered delivery - plain cheese pizza and a philly cheese steak - no peppers add tomatoes.  The lady on the phone was very nice.  The delivery lady was very nice.  I give them a 5 star for that.  My sub...where are the tomatoes?  None on it.  Meat was grey and flavorless. Sub roll was so soggy with grease that it fell apart as soon as I picked it up.  One of the worst Philly Cheesesteaks I have ever had.  Pizza was a 4 out of 5.  Sauce lacked flavor.  Yeah I know they say they have been using the same sauce for 40 years but seriously?  I am from New York.  I go to visit my family there on a regular basis and this is really not as good as a real slice of NY pizza.  I have found a good place but it does not deliver to my area.  I had high hopes after reading these reviews but they fell through.  What Sal's does have going for them is the price.  They are pretty cheap compared to other places that deliver to me.  My son liked the pizza - however the kid has no taste buds and covered the pizza with red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese before he even tasted it.  Therefore, my son's opinion doesn't count.  If I am hard up for dinner and don't want to drive down Eastern to pick up real NY pizza I may order from Sal again - just to make my son happy."}
{"text":"Love the food here and it's usually my go to spot but this is the SECOND time I called to order take out and the lady on the phone was very rude and unhelpful , sounded annoyed and had an attitude . The first time I gave her a break but this time I decided to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just tried Sal's recently. I really liked the pizza, and the breadsticks were good as well. Yes, the place is run by ASU students, but it's right in the heart of Tempe, so what do you expect? I can't really comment on their rudeness because I didn't experience it. I called to ask about delivery, and then called again when I got lost because google maps takes you to a completely different place. They were nice and helpful, and told me how to find them. I picked up my pizza and the guy working when I picked it up was polite. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just been to Sal's Pizza. I was disappointed to hear, he sold. New owner is very argumentative.

I guess the customer isn't always right. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the staff!! They are very clean and sanitary. 
No dirty dining here! And the food is bomb!!!!
The only thing I wish they would change are the fries. 
I beg of you to get new fries that taste like real potatoes and then everything will be perfect!! Please please please change those fries!!!!!"}
{"text":"bare bones place, less than 20 seats.

they didn't have sweet & low for my iced tea so the guy literally poured some sugar in a cup and gave me that, admitting it was \"kind of ghetto\" but that's all they had.

the pizza slices were great though and that's what counts in the end."}
{"text":"I love Sal's Pizza. my mom came across his place years ago, and even thought she is passed away now we still make a special trip to Sal's. I love the way he does his pizzas, we'll keep going to Sal's as long as he stay open for business. Thank you Sal."}
{"text":"Great pizza every time! Their ranch dressing is wonderful... and now they've added delicious Cannolli to their menu!"}
{"text":"We keep getting their flyers shoved through our door so thought hey let's give them a try. Order was taken promptly and delivery was fast and courteous. Opened the box and our pizza glistened before us, yes glistened because it had so much grease on it. After I mopped the grease off the top I ventured forth and was greeted with a tasteless and salty pie. Bummer. We learned our lesson and will stick with Rosati's for our future pizza nights!"}
{"text":"We ordered Sal's for the very first time yesterday for our Memorial Day pool party. I have heard people mention this place several times now for the best pizza around. We ordered a variety of things off the menu (3 different pizzas, chicken wings, chicken strips, and meatball sliders). The pizza is amazing - everyone at the party commented on the amazing crust! It's not too thin, not too thick, with just the right amount of crispiness to it. The garlic ranch sauce on the pizza is SO GOOD! The sausage and pepperoni are both phenomenal - the quality I would expect from a high-end gourmet pizza place. Everyone was also raving about how good the meatballs in the sliders were (I didn't even get to try one they were all gobbled up so fast!), and let's not forget that killer homemade ranch dressing! Sal's has super reasonable prices, great variety, amazing food, and fast & friendly service. I wish I hadn't waited so long to try this place! Give Sal's a try the next time you are in the mood for a good authentic pizza! But they have so much more than just pizza, their menu is quite impressive. The fact that they make everything (including the sauces!) from scratch is evident in every single bite, you can really taste the time, effort and love that goes into every single order. I am so happy that we finally tried this place and I cannot wait to order from them again!"}
{"text":"I'm bumpin' them up a star. They're pizza is consistently delicious and even the service is good. These are good guys serving a real good pie. Today I went with the meatball sub and it was money, too. 

Thank you Sal's. You're alright in my book."}
{"text":"Good pizza; super yummy. EXCEPT for when my boyfriend threw up all night, and I had to rush him to the ER. We thought he had colitis... Until the next day when I threw up! I don't throw up and haven't since I was 8. So this made me feel the worst I've ever felt. My boyfriend's aunt also got sick. I read recent reviews that workers sneezed and made the pizza and such. If you're going to eat here, make sure you watch the people that make your pizza!
To be blunt, this is probably the most disgusting experience I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"Love the super friendly staff and awesome food here. They're from back east and know how to make a good pie. Treat yourself to a great meal here, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Man, this took me back to the east coast. I grew up eating Sal's pizza for most of my life, it was a staple in my household. Walking in, I was grinning from ear to ear as it literally smelled like I remembered. I was greated by a really nice young lady who was pleasant and chatted with me while I waited for her to finish. 

The whole drive home all I wanted to do was eat all the things (Lg Cheese Pizza, two side Cesar salads and two cannolis). Getting home I found hot, bubbly cheese, fresh salads and wonderful deserts. The pizza was HUGE, just like I remembered. Tasted even better. The salads... were salads. Fresh, crisp, tasty. I ate so much... My stomach hurts. But. So. Good.  

The cannolis were crisp, soft and perfect. All in all, I can't wait to go back. Om nom nom."}
{"text":"good pizza that comes in large quantities! they have a great selection of pizza to choose from as well"}
{"text":"Tried this place and have been hooked ever since ! This is our go-to pizza spot, we always get the mushroom and basil pizza and a large side of ranch. Trust me , Sals ranch dressing is out of this world ! If your looking for a great classic pizza, this is the spot :)"}
{"text":"The best meatball sub I have ever had. I go out of my way when near to get another..I'm from the east coast so I know my subs...we call them hoagies...LOL. You will call this delicious. ENJOY"}
{"text":"If you looking for NY style pizza this is the place.  If your feeling a salad there anti pasta salad is great with there homemade ranch dressing."}
{"text":"Great Pizza giant slices nice people  3 TVs
Home made sauce is great and wonderful dipping sauce"}
{"text":"Sal's is as close as it comes to old school New York Pizza in Las Vegas. The guys are great, they have a delivery service as well. Do yourself a favor and get some Sal's pizza."}
{"text":"We have been buying pizza here for years. The crust has a good taste. Not sweet. The calzone are huge. The pizzas are very consistent. It's not New York but it Good vegas pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from Sal's on Friday and it never showed up. We ordered it at about 10PM and by 2AM we were begging to question if the pizza would ever show up... It didn't. We were called by a very polite representative from Sal's that did make sure to highlight the wonderful features the pizza had. The melted cheese, the golden brown crust, the sweet aroma. It sounded great, but alas, we were told we would never get to taste this taste delicious treat. It's been 48 hours since I ordered my pizza, and I am still waiting. Go cats. Meow."}
{"text":"refused to deliver!   really???    their pizza must suck but I don't know since they wouldn't take my order.     wow.    good luck with the business but you are not getting mine!"}
{"text":"[but see Update, below]  \"Mention Yelp and get 10% off\"... if you click on the \"Get Offer\" next to it on Yelp it takes you to Sal's website, when you arrive at their website, makes NO mention of the 10% discount.  When I mentioned Yelp for my 10% discount, I was told it was only in connection with Chowhound.  Someone should fix that reference... false advertising by someone...

Had to ask for a receipt after my purchase.  Bad practice.  Was never asked if I wanted a drink.

I ordered a 10\", the counter person then kept referring to it as a \"mini\" pizza, yea, well, bad merchandising... see my pik of the pizza, it really doesn't look \"mini\", why reference it in that manner???  Pizza missed some cuts, so was awkward to eat without tearing it apart.

Pizza was ok, as was crust, toppings; interior of the place looks to have been upgraded since a year ago when I last visited.

I'd give it a solid 3+ stars but they need to \"clean up\" their promotional merchandising and counter sales.

UPDATE [within 30m of my original review]... so as I was sitting at Sal's finishing up the rest of my \"mini\" pizza (btw, it was so NOT a mini pizza, much larger), the owner stopped by my table, apparently having just noticed my freshly painted Yelp review.  He honored the 10% Yelp discount, indicated that staff were just reminded of the discount, and we had a good conversation of the history of Sal's and how he came into the picture, expectations of customers, and possible future plans for the business. Honestly one would be hard pressed to find someone so seemingly sincere, down to earth, unpretentious, with a real desire to keep his business \"real\"... so pushed my rating to 4 stars, would do 4 1/2 if that option existed...

Look forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN TEMPE ARIZONA!!!!!
I have known the owner for about 3 years and they by far have the best pizza in the east valley. I'm from New Jersey, so I know good pizza. One slice of pizza equals a quarter of a whole pizza. and for UNDER 5 DOLLARS !!!!"}
{"text":"I last visited Sal's Pizza four years ago and wow have they expanded their menu - meatball sliders, seasoned bacon cheese fries, and their amazing cannoli ice cream sandwich, to name just a few additions. 

The food here is on another level - nothing beats made from scratch. From the dough and the pizza sauce to the ranch, you can taste the quality and dedication in every bite. And four years later, it's the same skilled pizza maker at the oven, making these amazing pies.

My words will never do this place justice. One taste of the food at Sal's Pizza and you'll definitely understand the truth in their slogan - \"Good Food Made By New York Italians\"."}
{"text":"my go to pizza place- always good, never had a complaint. - great pies- good sauce and fast delivery"}
{"text":"Nice people, decent food & fair prices.  It's what I order when I don't want to spend a lot but want better pizza than Little Caesars. 
Delivery guy is fast & super nice too!"}
{"text":"Sals Pizza is that hotspot that's always stuck around since you were little. The pizza is great. The fingers are great. The workers are kind. Overall it's always a great experience to just get some quick good pizza."}
{"text":"HUGE slices hit the spot after playing in a nearby youth baseball tournament.  Friendly customer service was appreciated!"}
{"text":"As a long time customer, even when it was Villa Pizza, I was always taken care and I always took care of them.

When the switch to Sal's came they promised that the quality wouldn't change. Because they were so good to my family and I, we maintained loyalty to their business.

Unfortunately throughout the switch we've had plenty of changes in quality and service. Sauce has changed, they don't carry celery, ranch is different, and the wings look suitable for a small child.

Tonight was my last night. When I entered to pay for pickup, the girl behind the counter was sneezing and blowing her nose. She opened the pizza and placed an white separator in the pizza. There's a lot of things I will tolerate, but food borne illness is one thing I refuse as a customer.

With all of these changes and tonight's encounter, I'm sad to say that I will not be returning to this business."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place to come to. They are always friendly the pizza and the carrot cake is to die for. If you love New York style pizza i highly recommend eating at Sal's pizza."}
{"text":"I love the huge slices of pizza they give. Despite being from Boston's North End, I think Sal's is a better, more professional, and more budget-friendly option for New York Style pizza than Gus's up the road. I ordered cheese and pepperoni slices and was pleased that they were not too greasy. Only downside is, like Gus's, the pizza is piping hot when you receive it (I understand piping hot pizza slices is part of New York cuisine, however, it is hot in Arizona, at least cool it down a little bit)."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good prices.  I love their Stromboli.  I normally order the original with garlic.  Third time I came in to pick up they even remembered my name.  They deliver as well."}
{"text":"moved here a month ago from Mass and I wouldn't feed the pizza here to my dog. NOTHING like the real thing from the North End. the dude behind the counter didnt even want to make the pizza I ordered and kept trying to get me to buy the pizza in the case that had been sitting there for who knows how long.....-_- all set w this place."}
{"text":"Just called to place an order for delivery and asked for a moment to pick out a pizza topping. Immediately the man on the phone said \"I'm sorry, I don't have time for that.\" and hung up. When I called back he said, \"I don't have time\" and hung up the phone-- AGAIN! Could be the best pizza in the world, but your company just lost our business. Thanks for treating us like such valued customers. Your manager will be hearing from us."}
{"text":"Sal's Pizza never disappoints; the food is always delicious, the price is reasonable, and the customer service is great. I wish I knew his name, but the delivery driver is so friendly and kind and I just wanted him to be recognized for his outstanding service every time. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I dig it. Ordered a small BBQ Chicken pizza. They accidentally made me an x-large and didn't try to charge me extra. Nice guys. Good pizza! I'm so down with trying other pizzas from them. Reminds me of NY street pizza, big, foldable slices with thick edges. They need more locations."}
{"text":"I went to Sal's today to try their pizza. I know the best way to find quality in pizza is to try the simplest item, I ordered a cheese pizza, I was impressed.  First of all they cook the pizza the way it's suppose to be cooked, in a brick oven. The crust was thin, a small amount of crisp on the bottom and had the right amount of chew. The sauce was perfect, not too much and not too sweet and the cheese was beautiful! Not greasy.  I have been In Las Vegas for around 25 years and have looked for a \"New York Style Pizza\" shop and I found out this place was just down the street from where I live the whole time. I have passed this place countless times and never tried it because it was attached to a gas station.  Don't let the look of the place fool you. I owned a New York style pizzeria in Texas for 6 years back in the early 80's since then I have been a little picky about pizza.  This place will satisfy your pizza addiction. I have found the only pizza shop I will go to from now on.  Thank You Sal's."}
{"text":"These guys are total creeps. Their service BLOWS and their pizza is AVERAGE at best. Tonight I tried ordering a pizza for delivery and the guy on the phone was a total moron. The delivery driver ending up getting lost, and then called me and told me that I \"sucked\"... STAY AWAY FROM THE JERKS..."}
{"text":"After eating at this establishment I stopped eating at other pizza chains;I love supporting small businesses. The pizza is great every time I eat there. I also LOVE their homemade ranch with their chicken fingers!! YUM!  Sal's also delivers which is super convenient, especially when I'm tucked away studying for an exam. Out of the 10+ times I've eaten here my order was wrong only once. I let them know and they went above and beyond to correct it. The staff is always super friendly and very welcoming. I'll be back time and time!"}
{"text":"Great variety at a great price. Slices can be overwhelming in size, but by the end you are finishing it. Don't stop at the pizza though, the wings are great."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and I was excited to see a non-chain pizza place nearby. The experience turns negative when they have an open kitchen and a tall guy just stares at you as soon as you enter the restaurant like he has a beef with you...
The boys ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs, I ordered Stromboli. $35 for a gas station pizzeria seemed high but hey what is cheap these days....
Spaghetti and Meatball arrived quickly and the boys thought they were OK.... waitress comes after a while and tells me it would just be a little longer on the Stromboli.....5min. later I actually see them push the Stromboli in the oven....the kids were half way through...so I go to the counter and ask if that was mine....and was told it is....At that point I lost appetite with the guy staring at me and asked for my money back for the pizza. This was complied with but there was no offer to have the pizza that they obviously screwed up. Most other places would have offered. The chef took the half baked pizza out of the oven and let it sit on top a shelf...not sanitary at all 9hopefully you weren't the lucky guy who ordered this later..... The boys took another 7 minutes to eat so I had the pleasure of watching them eat and overhear the table beside us talk about the pizza being like cardboard anyways....
We visited Sal's twice today ..... the first and last time..."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Pizza in Vegas. Not even close. I go to NY often and I grew up in Brooklyn. I know what Good Pizza is supposed to taste like. This is it."}
{"text":"This is the go to pizza. Always fresh. Beer right next door. My daughter loves this place."}
{"text":"Villa Pizza is the best. Pizza Hut PALES by comparison. It's real, unprocessed tasting. Not a pretty place at all, but so what. Don't dine in! I eat too much of it when I order it. That's the only thing that keeps me from getting it over & over. Have asked for 1/2 & 1/2 toppings, charged for just one. They knew what \"white pizza\" is (lived in New Jersey). Just the best!!"}
{"text":"I have tried to call Sal's a few times and they area always \"closing\" or won't deliver a few miles away.  If you are close and it is dinner time, great.  If not, don't bother."}
{"text":"Stopped by one night on my way home to bring my son a pizza cause he said he it's fantastic. I snuck a piece and gotta say although I'm from Cleveland and more preferable to Sicilian pizza the NY thin style pizza was pretty damn good. Good sauce(hate the term gravy) and crust was great. Take out will save you a lot more than delivery. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Been eating at Sal's for many years,  even when it used to be Villas! The pizza is the best in Vegas! The dough is so tasty, and the sauce is fresh and light. All and all an all around fantastic New York style pizza! The wing and fingers are delicious too, especially with the homemade ranch and blue cheese. We also really enjoy the sandwiches.  especially the meatball parm. And the pasta is decent too, but their pizza is the star of the show here, not mention the prices are very reasonable!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and Theresa who works there always give great service with a smile and treats everyone well. This is very authentic Brooklyn style pizza. Theresa is very pleasant and makes the overall experience great."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because I was in the mood for a meatball sub & my usual joint was closed on Sunday.  It's definitely a bit of no frills place but the meatball sub I had was outstanding.  In fact it was on par with the best Meatball sub I've ever had in my life from a place in Anaheim, Ca called Cortinas & that's saying a lot because I've been eating there before moving to Vegas for 15 years. The bread here was crusty on the outside & soft & chewy on the inside. The sauce had a delicious flavor & the meatballs were so delicious I could have eaten a bucket of them..lol. I'll be coming back to this place again & next time I'll try the pizza everyone was raving about."}
{"text":"ALWAYS AWESOME!!  I need to stop getting the Large Cheese pizza and try more stuff but it's always perfect!!  This place came highly recommended to me a year ago and it's great every single time and the people there are always awesome!  Yes it's really hidden inside the gas station but don't dare let that stop you.... you will be glad you went"}
{"text":"The person answering the phone might be the single worst employee I've ever encountered. I asked to order a delivery and he said, \"I'm too busy\" and hung up the phone. When I called back (mostly in disbelief that a business would hang up on a customer) he and asked if he wanted another attempt at my business, \"I'm sorry you feel that way bye\" and hung up immediately."}
{"text":"Live around the area and pass this place everyday. My husband brought a pizza home from here and it was okay but not great. My major downfall was the amount of grease in this pizza, I had to dab some napkins on it before I gave it to my kids...I don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"REAL ITALIAN pizza. For sure !!!  If you ate looking for authentic Italian pizza go here, I gave never been disappointed and the owner Steve is hands down a great business man. They are inside a gas station so you might think it's not good but don't let that throw you off. DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Hands down best chicken wings!!! Their homemade ranch amazing as well! The single slice pizza order is the best too... It's nice and toasted and not soggy like other places. Come here all the time and the staff is always very nice!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great customer service and great food highly recommended. Weird location. What is it with vegas and good gas station restaurants."}
{"text":"Sal's has the BEST buffalo wings/fingers. I'm always in the mood for their buffalo fingers, accompanied by their homemade ranch. They put garlic in their ranch and it seriously makes the ranch amazing. Sometimes I just want to buy the ranch just to have in my fridge. 

The pizza here is wonderful too, in my experience. I usually hate plain cheese pizza but Sal's is spectacular. 

The staff always says hello and are very friendly. Really, this is probably one of the best pizza/wings place and it's at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The son of sal himself served me up my pizza. ...  Two different customers of mine told me to try this pizza... Under cooked \"Tortinos\" ... 

1 star for how clean your kitchen looked and the other star was because of your staff member who took my order. He was very polite and pleasant to speak with ..."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sal's on and off for nearly 10 years since the shop is literally 2 mins away from my house.

Being from NY, I am super picky about pizza and in this town legit NY style pizza is hard to find.

Sals is good but if your looking for any type of customer service from the Grump Sal or his main sidekick Grumpy #2 then look elsewhere. I honestly think that eye contact or talking to customers is something they have no clue about. 

I could only imagine how successful this place would be is Sal would actually crack a smile."}
{"text":"If you're from northeast US, you appreciate good Italian pizza. This is great pizza. They are responsive and willing to make any type of pizza you like. Their speciality pizza is also good. Good/fair pricing."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are bad reviews about this place? I've been going here for about three years while I attended ASU and I have never had a bad experience. You really get a \"bang for your buck\" with two huge slices for only 5-6 dollars. There is usually a wide variety of selections to choose from. I LOVE SALS!"}
{"text":"Got the BBQ wings. Very good! Nice and crispy and a good amount of sauce. Great ranch to go with it. We had the pepperoni pizza. It needed more flavor. I think it was the sauce. Very bland!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Sal's Pizza! This has been a family tradition for years and we still eat here at least once a month. The pizza is delicious and fresh every single time. The ranch is on a whole new level! So good! I highly recommend Sal's to anyone looking for some good NY Pizza and wings"}
{"text":"I was actually looking for a sandwich shop next door when I stumbled across Sal's.  The sandwich shop was closed but the smell from Sal's permeated the air so I thought I'd give it a try.  I opted for one of Sal's famous 1 lb. calzones.  Yes, this thing was the size of a duffle bag!  

It was 4-star good!  They don't skimp on the stuffing, the crust was tasty, and the sauce tasted very home-made.  They had several pizzas by the slice for sale, each one looked very yummy and as reported by others, the slices are giant!!  

Overall, the food was good, the staff was friendly, the place was very clean, and locals must like it too because there was a steady stream of people picking up orders.  

I'm giving it 4 stars because, while quite good, it wasn't the \"best\" I've ever had and the atmosphere was lacking a little."}
{"text":"LITERALLY the best pizza in the area. If you can make the walk from ASU, you will not be disappointed. 5 dollars for almost a 1/4 of a whole pizza. Highly recommend buffalo pizza."}
{"text":"I am writing this in the hope that Sal's will improve and this business can stay in business. Let me preference this by saying I have a restaurant degree and have eaten Pizza all over America including living in Chicago, Las Vegas and New York.
I ordered the small pizza with Sausage, Pepperoni and onions. The crust is not NYC crust because you definitely cannot \"roll\" it, taste wise it was OK. The sauce was not too bad.
BUT, The amount of toppings on my Pizza was about the most skimpy I have seen yet in this city. So so on the Pepperoni, The sausage was about the size of a postage stamp and almost as skinny and very little of it.! Onions were diced like you would put on a chili dog and literally no more than a tablespoon.! They advertise pure mozzarella cheese but no matter how I tried I couldn't get it to \"string\".or stretch, a sure sign of processed cheese. It also could be that there was not enough cheese on it to stretch. The man that took my order was nice and the pizza came in an average time.
The pizza competition in Vegas is fierce. Heck, I can go to Blaze Pizza and get a pretty darn good extremely loaded pizza and a drink for less money than I spent here. Plus many more great places like Rosatti's, and hundreds of other local Pizzerias. I hope this helps.!"}
{"text":"Let's face it, pizza and ranch are delicious together and Sal's has some pretty damn good ranch! The pizza is really great too but I feel like a lot of places have good pizza, its the ranch that makes this place shine for me!!"}
{"text":"Had a slice of sausage and pepperoni pizza the sauce was kind of bland, crust was tough and chewy and the sausage and pepperoni lacked a little something as well."}
{"text":"I will die eating your pizza, because it's the best in Las Vegas. However, I ordered a large pie today 02/19/2016, I/2 pepperoni and 1/2 cheese. It was a little on the soggy side and you skimped on the pepperoni, but the wings were delicious! You were slipping today, but I'll always come back... Forever Loyal."}
{"text":"Just had the best New York style pizza at Sal's . 16 \" half pepperoni for me and half tomato and mushroom  for my wife.
Also available is a Sicilian pizza . Other Italian dishes and sandwiches are available . Prices are reasonable in this modest eatery. We will go back with friends.
Returned to Sal's with friends . The New York style pizza 16\" half pepperoni / half plain. Our friends had a white pizza w/ spinach. Both excellent."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Very friendly service, always got and fresh made with good ingredients. I highly recommend this place and I eat here weekly!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PIZZA! To me it is one of the best tasting in town. They're ranch is great and they also have the best chicken fingers too . I definitely recommend it for lunch."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Ordered a Sal special? and Fingers
$37.00 dollars later....Received a prompt delivery with a pizza that had half the contents slid to one side of the pizza and minimal amount of each topping.  Roughly 1 piece of pepperoni / 2 slices of sausage and a few random pieces of veggie.  The sauce had no flavor at all.  The fingers were big and tender but covered with so much breading ( not home made...They serve the same at the hospital I work at).  I can't believe that a lg pizza and 10 fingers cost that much.   Never will order there again!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in all of Nevada I drive across lLas Vegas to have their cheese pizza just like New York The prices are extremely good The absolute best it worth the trip and Customer service is Great  thanks for making my belly happy"}
{"text":"My husband randomly found this place and ordered a pizza for deliver. Not only was the pizza delivered within 30 minutes, but it was seriously the best pizza I have ever had. I have tried my fair share of pizza and even had a few slices in New York, but nothing compares to the pizza from this place. 
My personal favorite is the pepperoni. The slices are cut very large so usually one slice is enough for me. My husband and I like to order a large and then keep the leftovers for lunch or dinner the next day. If you're looking for something smaller, they have a mini pizza. It's a pretty decent size with 4 slices and great for sharing with another person. 
I highly recommend ordering a side of ranch because what's better than pizza with ranch?! And obviously, restaurant ranch is 1,000 times better than store bought ranch. 
We order for delivery every time and we have the most awesome delivery guy that remembers us and our dogs. I HIGHLY recommend this place not just for the amazing pizza but for the excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"This is my husbands favorite pizza spot, not so much mine however. I prefer the pizza that the cheese just strings off of when you take a might, Sal's is not the place to get that type of pizza. Their pizza is more the matted down, greasy type. It's quite edible though, despite these flaws. I usually get a ham and cheese Stromboli , which is delicious! I nice blend of mozzarella and ricotta cheese! Occasionally, we also will add wings to our order. Tonight we tried the sweet chili wings. At first, the smell of the sauce can be overwhelming, but the taste was good, something we would consider getting again. They are definitely not the cheapest pizza place on the block, but every once in awhile you can come across a coupon that can save you a few bucks in the money mailers."}
{"text":"Based on customer service alone, if i could give it zero stars I would. A friend and I walked into the business to use the restroom, unknowing that we needed to buy something first. As we walked out, two employees yelled \"THIS ISN'T A PUBLIC RESTROOM. FUCK YOU.\" This kind of customer service is unacceptable in any place of business, and I will never visit this facility ever again. Regardless of the potential quality of Sal's pizza, any company that hires employees who deem it justifiable to yell and cuss at people is not a business I am willing to support monetarily or verbally. Highly disgusted by this treatment, will not return again."}
{"text":"Pizza is okay, employees could care less. They are rude, they don't want to make pizza, and they don't care about customers. I wanted a pepperoni pizza and the guy pointed to old crusty pizza in a case and said, \"that's all we got left for the night\". Maybe it's because I went on 4/20. Anyway, it's okay pizza for the price, $5 for a big, yet old and crusty, slice."}
{"text":"Sal's has great food and courteous service.  The pizzas are consistently great and the homemade ranch is AMAZING!!!  We had the spaghetti with sausage last night and it was very tasty and it was ready at the time I asked it to be."}
{"text":"Good New York style pizza right in the epicenter of ASU. Good crust tasty sauce and quality toppings. They open at 10 AM which is good for early Pizza. Worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I'm from Brooklyn this is the real deal. Sal was making pizza and it was like home.The service was great. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place rules. The lil blonde kid JD was really courteous & friendly despite us coming in right before closing. The pizza was great as were the cannollis. Will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Sal's pizza rocks! I've been eating here regularly for about 8 years. Super close to my house so it's great for a quick meal and they deliver too! 

I love their calzones and the Italian subs are the bomb as well! 

The staff has all been there forever and they appreciate your business which is hard to find these days!"}
{"text":"Proper NY-style pizza, made to be eaten NY-style, folded in half.  One slice will do ya, since they're each one-quarter of a 19-inch pizza.  They have over a dozen options pre-made for buying by the slice, and service for whole pizzas is fast.  Mine was ready in 20  minutes.

Also, I like that they have three tiers of pricing for toppings.  I definitely recommend stopping in here, whether it's for a slice or a whole pizza."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! I've tried pizza all over and it's disappointing. For about 5 years this has been my go to for Pizza. I drive past several pizza places and from Mountains edge, just to have Sals. I recommend it to everyone! Service is always great and the only thing I wish I could change would be to make it closer to my home :)"}
{"text":"We have been eating Sal's pizza since we moved to Henderson many years ago!  It was a Villa's pizza then.  We always have it delivered.  Great pizza"}
