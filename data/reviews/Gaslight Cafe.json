{"text":"Excellent menu. Server totally versed on food allergies.  Wide selection of gluten free menu items, even bruschetta and dessert. Had the turkey ricotta sandwich on gf bread. It was really good. My friend got the crumble cake dessert and it was scrumptious. Cool atmosphere. Would be great for a date. Will be back for the high tea too!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever... the tattooed up thing that was supposed to be bartender was worthless.  Knew nothing about wine or anything... period... Never returning"}
{"text":"We were in the area for the Chocolate Affaire & cruised in for something not sweet & or coming out of a food truck (I love food trucks but nothing was ringing my bell) & found this gem. Super cute antique d√©cor in a historical building. The staff were fun & had great attitudes. We spent our time at the bar noshing on a reasonably priced bottle of white & a fresh warm delish baguette with olive oil & balsamic for dipping. Nice time spent chatting, noshing & people watching. We'll be back to try the sausage platter & bruschetta. They both look uh-mazing."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to come here twice for tea. Loved it both times! It is a secret treasure in the heart of Glendale! Very affordable compared with other similar services in Phoenix. Staff were polite and very accommodating. Tea and treats were all delicious and it is never crowded where you feel like you can't get privacy to enjoy your conversation. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to try a high tea with friends or family. Such a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here to grab a cup of coffee at intermission and it probably was one of the worst cups of coffee I've ever had. Also even though it's a 'cafe' they seemed very confused someone was ordering coffee to go.   The ascetics of the building and decor was very appealing for a new face of downtown Glendale so I would likely give it a try again but, I think if downtown Glendale cafe establishments want to complete with downtown Phoenix they need to up their customer service game."}
{"text":"It was an amazing lunch and a great price!  Great atmosphere too!!!!  Who knew there was a quaint B and B right in the middle of beautiful downtown Glendale.  Highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"The crumble cake is amazing!  I will come back for that alone.  The turkey sandwich was pretty good.  Love the atmosphere, very friendly staff.  Did I mention the stellar crumble cake?  It was warm from the oven with vanilla bean ice cream.  Divine! Excellent selection of wine etc."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and our server is fantastic. The food and drinks are the best in old Town Glendale."}
{"text":"Met a group of friends for high tea for a retirement party. Great service, wonderful selection of teas, and the quiche, tea sandwiches & pastries were outstanding! Thank you for a delightful afternoon! Will definitely be back."}
