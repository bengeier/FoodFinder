{"text":"We loved it here!!! Super family friendly and patient ! They have a whole section in the back for families with a chalkboard wall, kids games and crayons. The food was delicious as well. We'll definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"The 30$ all you can eat is a whole lot of simple but great food if you have the appetite! The tapas menu is also great value and delicious (try the super bacon!)

Best part of this sugar shack is the drink specials. Where else can you get 5$ pints, ceasers and hot cider with bourbon?"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars because my expectations were SURPASSED. I expected basic sugar shack fare -- which is comforting and sugary, but let's be honest, kind of bland and basic. The food here is really tasty. Everything has a homemade taste, and has a level of sophistication when it comes to ingredients and seasoning. You can tell the chef/owners understand quality food. I wouldn't say it's on the \"gourmet\" level like Pied De Cochon, but it's definitely worth of your $30 for an insanely filling brunch. If you're not a starving 300 lbs whale, you can opt for a few \"tapas\" small plates that are also incredibly decadent.

I'm sure it's child-friendly, but when I went there wasn't a single child in sight - BONUS."}

Growing up in Quebec, I'm no stranger to the cabane à sucre experience, and this, sadly, landed far, far from the mark.

The only decent thing to come out of the kitchen was the potatoes, and it seems that's where they dedicated all of their salt, as everything else was horribly bland.

They started off the meal with stale bread and homemade ketchup. Still trying to figure out how those two are supposed to go together. When the other food started arriving at the table, i.e when you might begin to use homemade ketchup, it was cleared from the table! When asked for more, we were brought a bottle of Heinz. I normally don't use ketchup when eating eggs, but they were so tasteless, they needed a boost. The pancakes that were served must have been made only of flour, water, and baking powder. Super dense, no seasoning, and they tasted just how you'd imagine flour and water would taste: horrible. And they didn't even put maple syrup on the table, we had to ask for it! The beans were watery and the coleslaw tasted like one you'd find in a cheap diner.

I know this is an \"urban\" cabane à sucre, but if you remove the first word, the result was still not a cabane à sucre, and I found it a little insulting to a beloved Quebec tradition. At $30 per person and such terrible food, this is clearly nothing more than a money grab to fool and take advantage of those who can't make it out to a real cabane à sucre."}
{"text":"A sugar shack in the heart of St Henry. No need to drive 30-45 min out of town. They offer local ingredients and at 30$/adult and 20$/kid for an all-you-can-eat. The only thing is that you will not find any ham, sweet sausage in syrup, creton or oreille de criss on the menu. You do have bacon and mergez. Still...it would of been nice to have, at the very least, some oreille de criss.

Onto the food. BLAND!!! I think they were out of salt, vinegar...anything that would give life to the food. The ONLY good thing was the bacon. Even the mergez was dry and overcooked. The slaw had NO sweet vinegar dressing. The pancakes tasted like they came from a box. The soup was tasteless. The potatoes, beans, the eggs had NO salt. None! Even the desserts were bland. The sugar/syrup in the flan wasn't caramelized at all. The sugar pie, kid you not, lacked sugar. HUGE disappointment! I was coming here expecting much more since they described everything being made with passion on their site. Not worth 30$. Not even 10$.

Service was good though."}
