{"text":"A great burger joint! They have few bar stools by the window so I would peg this as a take out place.  Burgers are thick and juicy and the fries are cut thick so they retain their potato flavour (I love potatoes!). I also ordered a deep fried Mars bar (it seems like something you have to order once in your lifetime). By the time I had it (after bringing it to my friends place and finishing my burger) it lost its crispiness so it was just okay. I would suggest having it right away...I really don't know what I was thinking when I decided to eat it last, it's a deep fried chocolate bar! Lesson learned."}
{"text":"i currently go to R.H King Academy and my usual go to lunch place is Big Boys Burgers. They have one of the best and biggest burgers i have ever had its better than Kelseys and McDonalds burger. Its also affordable the burger itself is only $4.00, the combo during lunch is $6.00 but only for students, it comes with huge fries which are almost like wedges and they also taste good. I recommend this place to anyone who loves burgers and are cheap."}
{"text":"Wow, this might look like a hole in the wall but it is outstanding! Possibly best fries ever!!!! Everything home made, juicy hot and fresh! Yum. Welcoming and enthusiastic service too."}
{"text":"friendly and fast service.   Burgers are big and tasty.  fries and onion rings are hot and crispy the way I like."}
{"text":"If your looking for a fast friendly burger joint this is the place to go hands down!! I had the steak on a Kaiser and it was cooked to perfection with a very tasty milk shake to wash it down, great experience I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Killer philly cheese-steak sandweech!!!!  tasty tender steak slabs of provolone sauteed mushrooms & onions toasted bun  A couple next to me ordered the poutine. It was awesomely giiiiiiiiinormous!!! It would've taken 2 forks and 2 days for me to pound-down all those friggin fries!!! - Guess what I'm ordering next time??? hehe  Cool greek owner not afraid to roll up his sleeve's and do his thing behind the grill. Love his eagerness and enthusiasm!!  Old-school burger joint that puts together good-eats ---- good-prices.    Opa . . ."}
{"text":"If you love philly cheese steak or poutine you can have either or both at big boys.  The Philly-liscious poutine is insanely good.  The owner always has themed specialties as well.  Like the Rob Ford which is an absolute delicious mess."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about Big Boys Pickering!  First off, the relaxed, but fun race car atmosphere really gets you in a positive mood for some great food!   Upon entering, everyone is greeted and even though it was my first time here, I felt like a regular.  Everyone from the big boy/gent at cash, to the awesome people making the food was super friendly and great conversation.   We were warned that the burgers were big and I can assure you that they're definitely a solid slab of meat!  The Big Boy Burger is a steal at $6.95!  The food came quickly and tasted amazing!  The half pound patty was cooked perfectly, the burger was put together with extreme care.  The Greek fries are a must! Thick cut fries topped with feta and their house made dressing is by far the best greek fries I've tried thus far.  I actually had a few customers in line peek over to see what this side was. I turned down a shake at first, but the owner convinced me and I'm glad he did. The orange soda shake tastes exactly like a Creamsicle!   Overall, I am one satisfied customer who will definitely be back for more!  Big Boys Burger in Pickering is a great place satisfy the biggest of appetites and the people take it to the next level.  Keep doing what you're doing!  Food:   Big Boy Burger - 1/2 lbs greek fries  onion rings   Drink:  bottled water orange sods milk shake"}
{"text":"crispy chicken burger was 5 stars.  fries were 5 stars  the beef inside the big boys burger was 3 stars  The big guy behind the counter had great customer service. I can tell he loved working their."}
{"text":"Fries are good, burgers are good.   Beware of the big boys poutine. It will probably kill you. A big portion of poutine with bacon and a half pound burger chopped up on top. It looks disgusting but tastes pretty good. You should probably share it with someone though, a full portion is way too much for anybody."}
{"text":"AWesome burgers and amazing service!   Went to Starr burger and had such a horrible experience!  What you get at Starr burger is Crap, pure crap burgers and insolent high school people who are so unbelievable rude. Made me appreciate this place even more!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at big boys before i moved 3yrs ago. Today i picked up a bunch of burgers, phoned and ordered ahead and picked them up on time. My food was ready, service was fantastic and very accomodating. She checked my order and everything was there. Got home and had a bite!!! OMG! I dont know how i cls have stayed away so long!! AWESOME! 5 Chill out all of u impatient peeps!! Good food takes a few minutes! Marcella"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, the only problem is that I never have room for the deep fried mars bar! I have to stop in just for dessert some time."}
{"text":"It's a nice local burger establishment.  Clean.  Original decor (race car bucket seats).  Friendly.  My typical order is the Big Boy Burger (1/2 lb) with fries or onion rings.  The I like the taste of their burger.  I think it could be juicer but they have a tendency to cut into the patty with the spatula to check if it's done.  Nevertheless, I still go back for more.  The toppings offered are standard fair (ie. onions, pickles, lettuce, tomato, peppers).  What I really enjoy are their fresh cut fries.  They are so good.  Nice thick cuts with the skin on.  Always crispy.  The other side I really enjoy are the onion rings.  It's got the right amount of batter, not too thick and heavy.  The only thing is the batter absorbs a lot of the oil which is typical of onion rings.  I did order the souvlaki chicken once (take out) for the kids and it'll be the last.  The chicken pieces were thin cuts and on the dry side.  The salad with dressing made the fries soggy.  It's not worth the price (not cheap).  Overall, this will continue to be my main burger place in town.  Burger price is good and I like the taste."}
{"text":"Burgers are fantastic! Don't take plastic though - cash only."}
{"text":"Usually when I want a burger I make a trip to Lick's in Scarborough (Morningside & Kingston). Been meaning to try Big Boys and recently I did. Ordered the Original burger combo with cheese and fried onions. It was great! The fries were also good if a bit on the greasy side. I  Next time I feel like a burger I'll be going to Big Boy's  Next trip I'm getting a deep fried Mars bar for desert!"}
{"text":"Nice people and fast service.  Generous with the toppings. But the burger was really just okay at best. Too much bun that I did not enjoy at all.  The portion of fries was generous, but they were also just okay. Awkward parking. Cash only. Would not return."}
{"text":"This is a great, no-nonsense place to get your burger fix. We unknowingly came here 5 minutes before closing but the owners were still very friendly and didn't mind at all.  As for the food,the buns that they use somehow avoided making the burger a soggy mess by the time we got home to eat it, unlike most other places. The deluxe poutine was also delicious and had a good mix of cheese, gravy and bacon. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here based on the good reviews. This place has a great backyard BBQ taste. Their burger was great, I enjoyed the toasted bun. The onion rings were nice and crispy and their steak sandwich was really good as well. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Consistently good service and tasty food! I'd rather spend my money here for an amazingly juicy fresh burger with thick cut fries and gravy than going to McDonalds or Wendy's and spend a similar amount."}
{"text":"Are you hungry? Do you crave a tasty burger? You must try this place. Burgers are very tasty and filling. The fries are very good Just try it, I can't see for any reason why anyone wouldn't like it. Shit now I'm hungry"}
{"text":"I had their burger it was ok.  I found it overcooked.  Staff seemed friendly enough.  Burger joint was clean but didn't check out the ladies room."}
{"text":"Seriously , this place is a dump. It serves   very mediocre premade hamburger \"patties\" and passable fries and onion rings.No big whoop. Yeah so they toast the bun! So what !  Didn't see the deep fried Mars bar. Maybe a reason to go back. Otherwise, its a Harvey's disguised as something else."}
{"text":"Burger Time! Big Boy's is bright blue, checkered and yummy all over. The parking lot is always busy(added bonus of sweet cars out front) and there was a line up both times I dropped in. Gotta be good, right?   The staff are fun and make you at ease when you have no idea what to order. They are also honest about the amount of food you're going to receive. The fries are definitely big enough for 2 people and I appreciate them telling me that. Food is a terrible thing to waste!   Did I mention the fries are AMAZING? Crispy and thick cut, we didn't leave one behind. The gravy was a deeeelicious. The burgers were juicy, fresh and they had the perfect variety of toppings to choose from. Can't go wrong when you choose the toppings!   I've already been a couple times and I know I'll be back a few more. My boyfriend AND dad both gave it their burger seal of approval.   Looks like I'll be seeing you again!"}
{"text":"We have been curious about this restaurant for a long time, and yet never stopped in.  The parking lot is always packed; for sure a good sign.  It's a little diner-type place, brightly decorated with hot-rod decor, checkerboard floors, bright and fun!  The first things that struck me was how diligent the staff are at greeting patrons, and in general upkeep/sweeping, wiping tables.  Both huge factors in making a good impression, for sure!  The menu looked appealing, and prices are reasonable.  My kids had a 7 oz. combo (shared the burger), and I ordered the Big Boy combo (huge 9 oz. burger), of which I only ate half and had the rest for dinner.  We got 1 combo with fries and onion rings with the other.  They were fresh, generous, and just so delicious.  Drinks are generously offered with refills on the house.  We left so stuffed, and eager for a return visit.    I brought hubby for a return trip.  Another burger combo for the kids, again great!  My husband ordered the Steak Dinner, which comes with fries, Greek salad, and a drink.  He got grilled onions and mushrooms on his steak.  I got the chicken souvlaki on a pita (and my husband's salad, since greek salad isn't his thing)  The souvlaki was moist, so flavourful, and smothered in tomatoes, onion, and yummy homemade tzatziki sauce.  The salad was HUGE, and delicious, although 2 minor complaints.  Too much feta, and not a single greek olive!  I'll be ordering it next time with half as much cheese, because although it was delicious, it was so rich.  I had a taste of my husband's steak, and it was super-tender and juicy.  We have got a few favourite places to eat, and Big Boy's has very easily earned a spot in that category."}
{"text":"I read the reviews of big boys burgers and they were highly recommended. I ordered their quarter pounder combo and a friend of mine had the half pound combo. I don't like talking bad about people but this burger was very disappointing. Their fries seemed as if the oil needed to be changed.   I honestly ate 7 fries and threw out the gravy too.  I don't like leaving reviews usually as it takes too much time but I felt it was important to warn anyone who might go there, these burgers are absolute trash! I forgot to mention that I found two hairs in my food but I still ate the burger just so I can write a review for anyone who dares to go in this establishment. Please don't go into this establishment and save your $13 I hate you big boy burgers!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and still cant believe the amount of food provided.  The burgers are grilled to perfection and always tasty and the prices are reasonable.  The staff is friendly and always patient and I like the nostalgic feel when I go in."}
{"text":"After several return trips to Big Boy's Burgers, I have decided that I've found my new favourite burger joint.  I have yet to find a complaint about this place!  (Hence the additional fifth star for excellence & consistency.)  Every time I go, the food is fantastic.  The burgers are juicy, flavourful & cooked perfectly, the fries are piping hot & rival anything you'd find at a chip truck, & the customer service is excellent.  They greet every customer warmly, & when you leave, they thank you for your business.  On those rare times when there's nobody waiting to order, the cashier is sweeping the floor, or cleaning the tables to make sure the place is always clean.  Consistently great food at a fair price coupled with great service in a nice, clean environment makes for a winning combination.  Keep up the good work Big Boy's!"}
{"text":"Holy Joe!!   I went in for a burger and got the best ribs I've ever had in Toronto.   And I've had a lot of ribs.  Did not expect this and it is not a permanent menu item. But they were fantastic."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Whitby hands down! Their burgers are delicious, and as well the other items on the menu. Apart from the burgers, I would highly recommend their big boys poutine and deep-fried Mars bar.  I did not give five stars because this place needs a bit of a renovation. However the place is clean and bright with wonderful customer service. Would definitely come back here in the future!"}
{"text":"Cook had bad cut on his finger with no band aid.  I was sick for a day after eating the Frozen steaK sandwich. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"There are pros and cons to Big Boys Burgers...  PROS - Food is excellent - Big burger, great fries and onion rings - Prices are reasonable - Lots of parking - Nice decor  CONS - Small portions of fries and onion rings - They charge $1 for fried onions on your burger (most places that's free) - Fried onions slightly over cooked and tough - They ration you to one napkin per person (that's just cheap) - Poor service, everyone seems miserable, not friendly - Not enough seating.  Most of the seating is by the cash, so you see everyone's butt in your face while you are trying to eat  As I said, the food is very good so it is worth a visit.  For me, I'd rather drive the extra 5 minutes down the road to Shake Rabble and Roll where you get all the pros and none of the cons."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating a well done burger! So I like to try different places that make burgers.  I must way that I really like the burger here, it was made to order which was a nice touch, they had lots of veggies which I like. The fries of course is a staple of a side with your burger and the were pretty good.   Overall this was not the best I have had, but it definitely is pretty good. I have come back several times so they are doing something right."}
{"text":"There is no way you haven't heard about these guys. They bring burgers to a whole new meaning. This small mama/papa joint feel, brings your taste buds to life! The burgers are all flame grilled and ready to serve in ten minuets.  The service is exceptional. If you ever need a good talk or a laugh, they are the guys to do it. They make everyone feel welcome and like they've known you for years!  2 THUMBS UP TO BIG BOYS! WOO WOOOOO"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but I always get take-out.   Everything is what you expect in a place like this. Fries are truly tasty, onion rings great, burgers and homeburgers are both worth the price....homeburgers being of course more expensive.   Best of all to me is the souvlaki on a stick and their Greek salads. I also find it nice to have a family owned restaurant. They are really friendly and want you to come back.  Very nice people."}
{"text":"I had a burger and poutine here once I will never go back. One word of advice save your money lol"}
{"text":"These are type of burgers you get at a back yard bbq, well done (no pink in the middle) with grill marks and some char to it. Pile up the fresh toppings then add some bbq sauce to top it all off. The fries are delicious after adding some malt vinegar, it's carby heaven. Easy on the wallet with their original burger at $4.95. Manning the grill is Jim (Demetri) a sweet gent who makes you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Great food! Kind of expensive. But you are paying for the quality. Definitely somewhere Id eat at again!"}
{"text":"Came in on a whim and was greeted warmly by the two nice gentlemen working; unsure if they were the owners but definitely welcoming. I looked up and saw a standard menu; burgers poutines, onion rings, fish & chips, steak on a kaiser... as I was hmmming and hahhing on what to order, I look down and was immediately surprised to see a slideshow of heart clogging, drool-worthy deliciousness as snapshots of burger and poutine combinations flipped by - the mac attack (mac & cheese burger), phili-licious poutine (philly cheese steak on poutine, the rob ford burger (egg bacon and cheese on a burger), pulled pork burger - now it's worth reviewing!   So we got the rob ford burger and the philly burger with a side of onion rings (who am I kidding? I'm not a snob to this simple but yummy fried onions) for $27 after taxes and they make everything fresh to order.  The verdict - onion rings were standard but still yummy - crispy, large, flavorful - it still disappeared in less than 2 minutes.  My hubby's philly burger - i can't personally say if it's good coz he inhaled it with nothing but the sauce around his mustache left to show for it.  The rob ford was decent... to be fair, I ordered standard food but the burger was not only large but moist and enjoyable.  There was a huge bacon piece with EVERY bite, sweet caramelized onions to balance the saltiness and the oh-so good gooeyness of my runny egg (kryptonite).  It's a simple burger done well.    pretty good, big boys... pretty darn good!   I'll be back to review your poutine and milkshakes (red velvet, cookies & cream, and candied bacon - OH YEAH)"}
{"text":"The name suits this place really well. The burgers are definately really big. The patty was bigger than the bun. Nice friendly service. Good for a quick bite if you are craving for a burger. I would say its one step above Harvey's in terms of quality.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great food with very friendly staff!  Never had a bad experience while I visit. They make your burger from scratch, and they do it just how you like it. They offer a variety of different food options from salads, burgers, milkshakes, and even deep-fried mars bars.  The one thing I will say is that the parking isn't too great. But other than that if you're looking for a great burger, I would highly recommend this place. It's a bit more expensive than McDonalds for example, but the quality is well worth the price."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  If it weren't for Yelp Burger week, I honestly would have no reason to come all the way here. It's located in an area of Scarborough I rarely go to, and the intersection in front of the restaurant is quite dangerous. Nonetheless, I chose this place for my Yelp burger as it's (relatively) transit accessible, as I didn't have the car for this week.  The Yelp burger consisted of the original burger with bacon and cheddar cheese. I added lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and BBQ sauce to my burger, which are the standard ingredients I add to most of my burger orders.  For $5, this burger was good. The size was reasonable, the ingredients tasted decent, and the bun had some nice flavour to it. I did, however, found my patty quite dry overall and burnt in a couple of places. Also, the tomatoes in the burger had a pickle aftertaste; not sure if it was the tomato itself or if it got mixed with the pickle pile earlier.  Service was excellent, and the two owners(?) of this place were wonderful to talk to. It was a busy burger place as well, which says wonders considering the location. For myself, I don't come to this corner often, but if I do end up nearby I wouldn't mind visiting again."}
{"text":"Definitely a big boy burger that was fairly priced. I only went with 3 stars however as it was a bit dry, the bun collapsed as soon as you picked it up and overall I found it average.  Fries were very well done and people were indeed friendly so I will likely give them another try.   As far as the interior goes...well I can see there is a theme, however it's really rather cold, a bit cheesy and doesn't look professionally done."}
{"text":"To say I'm obsessed with this burger joint is an understatement. Well first this isn't just a burger place... They have chicken , salads , wings , fries , steak, souvlaki and so much more!!!!! The friendly staff make it SUCH a nice atmosphere and it's always clean! The toppings are so good ... pickles , relish , sauces , cheese, peppers etc!!    Don't get me started on the portions... You can share everything ( but don't because you'll want it all).   The veggie burger makes you question if it actually is a veggie burger because it is SO GOD DAMN GOOD!!!!   Just do your self a favour and get here NOW!"}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Ontario. I live 2 hours away but anytime I pass by I have to stop in. The burger is my go too every time with back bacon and regular bacon. My wife has tried many other items on the menu and loved every one of them. Plus, the crew at big boys are really good people!"}
{"text":"Not worth going to!  The location is good, they must get some business from the highway, but the parking is terrible.  The decor is interesting, but the restaurant is poorly designed for handling line ups and stuff. Not enough seating.  My burger was gross! The bacon was disgusting, and the rest of the burger wasn't  anything special. The fries are really good though.   I always said I would go back and NOT eat a burger but try something else, but I never really felt that need to go back."}
{"text":"The owner is genuinely a nice person! Great personality and amazing client service. However to me, my overall feel for the place was an OK.   The decor needs to be redone, I am definitely NOT saying change the design. More so, re upholster the racer seats and perhaps raise them higher for the tables. It was not the most comfortable thing to sit on but the idea is there.  The food was good, I ordered a caesar salad with steak however I got a greek salad with steak instead. The salad itself was good however the steak tasted like old meat... I don't know how to describe it but it just tasted off.   I also ordered a poutine which was good, again not amazing but good. I would most likely go back and try their burgers since I see so many people raving about it..."}
{"text":"Big Boys remains in our regular rotation, we come here at least twice a month, if not weekly. I've recently stumbled on a new favourite, gyro on a pita and fries! Amazing! The meal they have can be too much food (that one comes with gyro, salad and fries and the takeout container is HUGE) and this is the best of both worlds!  I love the staff here. If one is outside having a break, they'll stop what they're doing and hold the door open for you. Who does that!? Amazing service. We usually call our order in ahead of time and they know to expect us because of our order. You can't go wrong coming here, the food is excellent and service is top notch."}
{"text":"This Big Boy's is located at Whites and Hwy 2 in the Lone Star Plaza. I had intended on coming here a few weeks back for a greek salad but they were closed, so this weekend I went out a little earlier and decided to try again.  When I walked in, it wasn't that busy but considering it was 6:30 on a Sunday evening, I wasn't expecting them to be hopping. I placed my order for a greek salad with chicken and tzatziki on the side and had a seat to wait. I've been in this Big Boys before but in general, this is one of the cleaner, more well-maintained restaurants I've been in lately. This store isn't new by any means, but they keep the space where you eat clean and do the same with the food prep area and the cash. They do have quite a bit of room to sit in and eat, multiple tables of four with special 'driver' seats and a bar along the side of the store with stools to sit down on.  I probably waited around 10 minutes for my dinner to be ready and then I was out the door and on my way home. I was a bit surprised by the portion size of my salad, it seemed a little small when I opened the container but there was more than enough salad inside. Mine came with onions, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers (I think...), the obligatory lettuce that makes the salad, feta cheese and chicken. They asked me if I wanted tzaziki and I suppose it's just meant for the chicken for dipping because there was no pita or anything included. All in, great flavor and super tender chicken. The dressing was tasty, everything was fresh and before I knew it, it was all gone! The only thing missing for me was tasty pita to go along side my healthy dinner!  I'll definitely come back here again, the fries here are quite good, but the salad was definitely a winner for me in an area where you can't really get many salads as takeout without worrying about what's in them."}
{"text":"We;ve had to chicken Souvlaki, the steak sandwich and the burgers..all are fabulous..this place is beyond good..it's fabulous..delicious."}
{"text":"The veal was unreal. If your down to eat a meal, just drop by big boy and get fixed up today!  Satisfy that hunger, and then come see me at Whitby Oshawa Honda next door for all your new and pre owned  truck van car and SUV needs!  Nobody Beats The Price From Pete!"}
{"text":"Great quantity of the food for the price. I love the freshness and friendliness of the staff as well. Perfect burger joint in a neighbourhood where they are lacking since Licks down the street closed down. Totally recommend Big Boys."}
{"text":"Best burger joint ever! Their onion rings are fantastic. Very friendly service. Got our order right away and with a smile.  I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I was served by 3 big guys when I went to Big Boy's Burgers for my burger fix. One took my order, one cooked my burger and one dressed it up! :P I was the only customer that have cravings for a burger in this chilly weekday afternoon.  Original Burger ($3.95) - This is the most crispy toasted buns (with grilled marks!) I ever have in a burger joint.. in fact anywhere.. I personally love mine toasted because it won't get soggy with all the condiments when I am enjoying my burger - beef is A-OK... nice charcoal marks.. a little on the dry side which I am not too surprise. As the patty itself is quite thin... - standard toppings  - great value for the price!!  The restaurant itself is in racing car theme.. the seatings are race car bucket seats.. I think kids and teens loves it here... hey I think they all love burger, fries and a deep fried Mars bar as dessert!"}
{"text":"Big Boy's Burgers is a great neighbourhood burger joint if you are in the area and have cravings for a burger.  Nice and Friendly staffs and the beef patties are cooked on grill in open flame when order... love that fresh off the grill taste!!  Original 1/4 lb with fries and small drinks ($7.35) - love the toasted bun - I think the beef patties though good and moist.. but I think I will go for the 1/2 lb next time as the patty is kind of small :) - toppings are basic with the usual onion, lettuce, tomato....  - Fries are cut home style like wedges with all the skin, tasted fresh right off the fryer  There are also other items on the menu: gyros, sovulaki....  A few bar stools if you prefer to stay in.... and watch some CP24."}
{"text":"So I returned to Big Boys for lunch today. I haven't been there for a few months but I guess over those few months they must have changed over owners. Which sucks because I really like the old guy Chris he seemed to have made his food with a lot of love.   So even though I noticed that I still decided to give it a shot boy was I disappointed I ordered a fish and chips dinner and it had to have been the worst experience of my life at Big Boys. A place those usually so consistent was anything but that today my fries was so overdone and so hard It kept scratching the roof of my mouth with every bite the fish itself was horrible and super fishy my salad have a ton of dressing on it and made it almost unedible. I may give this place one more chance with the new owners being in place but not for a while. 14 bucks down the drain smh!"}
{"text":"Fries are great. Decor is a little rough (torn seats). Staff are friendly. Prices are fair and the burger is average."}
{"text":"Great burger which will definitely fill you up and satisfy your taste buds. Buns were toasty and the beef patty was flavourful. Location wise it isn't too convenient but the overall experience outweighs it. Would definitely go back when I'm around this area."}
{"text":"The portions are certainly big, and excellent value for money. Typically about $11 per person. I had the 'Big Boy Poutine' which also has 1/2 lb of burger and bacon on top of their poutine. It was so good! The fries were too salty for my personal liking, but my wife liked them that way. I'm sure next time I go I can get them to hold off on the salt.  The service is very friendly, and we were in no way limited to 1 napkin. The staff were very accommodating to my young son, who was very interested in how they cooked everything. The seating is limited in that there are no movable chairs, but apart from that, there is ample seating for the size of the place, and contrary to the previous review, you aren't sat looking at peoples butts."}
