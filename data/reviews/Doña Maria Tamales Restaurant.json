{"text":"This was the worst experience ever! I am so disgusted by what I saw the waiter do that I couldn't even eat my food. The waiter stuck his hand and arm in the horchata machine to fix something, and didn't even dump the horchata out. This place is so dirty! There is no customer service at all. I do not recommend this place to anyone. My husband and I will never return. very dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Dona Maria's is extremely over-rated.  They are located East of the strip in a seedy part of town- near the pawn shops and wedding chapels.  The restaurant is a hole in the wall with bars on the windows, but very large inside.  It has some charm and has been there since the 80's, but it's not especially clean and the booths are sticky.  Their chips and salsa were good (although the salsa tasted a bit like pizza sauce), their guacamole was more of a guacamole \"dip\" and had been watered down with sour cream- it had no flavor.  It was similar to what you would find at Roberto's or other low quality Mexican restaurants.  Their tamales come in pork, chicken, cheese, and a raisin desert variation.  I came here with my husband and my dad, we tried the chicken and cheese ones and none of us liked them.  They are extremely salty and flavorless, and actually some of the worst tamales I have ever had.  We all love Mexican food and have had lots of tamales, being from CA.  These do not compare.  I would skip this place in favor of almost any other Mexican joint."}
{"text":"If you're a fan on Mexican food, you may think it's ok to judge an establishment primarily on the taste of their guac. I do just that. It's great! Not the best (go to Arizona for that), but it's very very good. Service was great too! Bathrooms decent. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican and had heard about this place from a couple of locals in Vegas. All I can say is I guess people have varying taste. I had the beef taco, chili relleno and a tamale. The beef taco was soaked in marinade, the chili relleno had zero flavor and the tamale that this place is their staple signature dish was as dry as the desert this Las Vegas town sits in. The only thing I found good here was the chips and the service. Pass on this place."}
{"text":"Great tamales !!  Great service !! 3 rd time this week and heading for more thank you !!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I've been to this restaurant a handful of times and it's never been outstanding but it killed your Mexican cravings. Today I left the restaurant thinking why didn't I go to the new Farmer Boy restaurant instead. Everything seemed pretty average until I had to take my two young daughters to the restroom.........filthy! Mind you there are only two toilets and one was clogged, gross! ! It looked like a restroom in TJ! My husband ordered the Chile Verde and it had no spice and they must have been low on the meat. I ordered the grilled talapia, it was smothered in this green, garlicky disgusting cream. Fresh fish should not smell like fish and this didn't smell like fish, it smelled like sewer!! I'm sure that's why it was smothered in the green sauce. The refried beans had so much lard you couldn't taste the beans. I sent my dish back, i was not going to risk getting food poisoning.  My daughter ordered the pork tamales, she gave me a taste and the same thing with the beans pure lard, I told her not to eat anymore because she could get sick. Sure enough she spent the whole night throwing up. Never, never will I go back to that sewer in the wall. Bonito michoacan or Viva Mercado are excellent choices, they have clean restaurant and their food is always fresh and clean."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once.  One of my co-workers highly recommended.  At the hotel, the front desk highly recommended against eating there.  So we decided to opt for the co-worker's opinion and gave it a chance.  

I didn't have the tamales and all of the other reviews seem to emphasize how good these are.  So maybe these are what gives Tamales a 4-5 star opinion.  

I can say on my observation that:
1) the salsa tasted like spicy pizza sauce...very unimpressed. 
2) the food was nothing I haven't seen outside of any run-of-the-mill \"Mexican restaurant\" in the DC area.  
3) the place seemed to be very popular with the locals since the place was pretty full and everyone seemed like locals.  Our server was very nice. 

There really wasn't anything outstanding about this place.  I'd skip on it if you have any other options.  It's not terrible at all, you'll get a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"Not happy with Dona Marias Downtown Las Vegas. Ordered half dozen chicken tamales and half dozen beef. I got all beef. In order to get a credit I have to bring the wrong tamales back. Well that won't work considering my guests will be here in 30 minutes. Shame on you Dona Marias."}
{"text":"Dona Maria's cannot be beat for quality, service, authentic food...I have been coming here for about 5 years now and have never been disappointed!!!  I love coming here with people from  out of town....their tamales are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Quick to respond. Food subpar.  Darn!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Excited to find this little restaurant - no wait time on a Thursday night. I ordered poisons and it was yummy. My husband ordered fish tacos and they were quite tasty. We would def be back next trip to Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Best margaritas, yummy chips and salsa, cactus tacos and tamales- what else could you want?"}
{"text":"I love this place! an icon on the Las Vegas landscape. The food is great, the drinks smooth and the service super friendly. One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! Got some tacos and flan. It was all very good! The waitstaff is great and has a great sense of humor."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I've ever tasted. We moved here from San Diego and have been searching for good Mexican food. This place is far from it. If you're from Cali (south bay, city heights) don't go here. You'll be disappointed. I'm curious why the locals think this is considered good Mexican food? Low standards I guess. The salsa tastes like hunts tomato sauce."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a little kid in the 80's. I have tried many of their dishes over the years, but mostly I'd order a dozen or two tamales (chicken-green and the cheese and pepper one). I must say the food is almost as great as it was when the owners were cooking themselves. They have the best Tamales, Chile Relleno and green enchilada suiza around. The only downside is the dozen tamales price is rising faster than our economy's inflation. I remember when the dozen was 12.95 now its a whopping 21.95. Its still worth it, but if they keep going up they'll lose a 25+year patron."}
{"text":"Maybe one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a Mexican food restaurant. Actually, it was the worst. It took us 45 minutes to get our food. I ordered the the taco plate (two tacos, beans and rice) and my gf ordered the tamales plate. Now, the tamales were good, nothing bad to say about them, but the fish was discussing. First off, it was the blood line cut, so it was super fishy tasting (to fishy tasting to eat). Then they upcharged me 3 dollars for steak, but I had gotten fish? Mind you I did not eat more than one bite and left the rest of the fish tacos for them to pick up and throw away. So..They would not take the 3 dollar charge off when the fish taco on the menu was only 30 cents more than a shredded beef taco(what the plate was supposed to come with I guess). The waiter did not tell me it would cost any more money. So when they did not take it off, the owner/manager tried to lie his way into convincing me that his price was right. End the end I just laghed at him, had him charge me the 3 dollars and wrote on the receipt that was his tip."}
{"text":"Their food is a bit expensive and not as good as we though. The chips and salsa were good and so was the coffee. They also provided us with great service. I ordered a chicken taco and chicken tamale that comes with rice and black beans. The rice and taco were good but the tamale was OK. I have had tamales before and they were much better then the one I ate here. I should point out the tacos are served in crunchy corn shell and not the soft corn shell which is a bit strange for an authentic Mexican restaurant. Like I mentioned their prices are a bit high especially for being away from the main action of the Vegas strip (it is located more near Freemont St). I would not recommend this restaurant to someone who wants authentic Mexican food. I do recommend Tacos el Gordo which is farther down the Las Vegas Blvd near Circus Circus."}
{"text":"truly one of the most vile experiences of my vegetarian life. while I had fries 'straight-outta-tha-freeza', and a margarita/slurpee somewhat tainted by gum arabic, the omnivores in my group were almost universally disgusted by their cheese/meat/grease bomb burritos or whathaveyous."}
{"text":"You eat the Tamales here.  You order 1 per person and you order another if you aren't full (you may be after 1).  They cost about $4 each.  They make three different kinds, the sauces vary from one type of tamale to another, I prefer the one with the dark brown mole sauce (I forget if that was the chicken or the cheese tamale) . . . I don't know a thing about anything else on the menu.  I only eat tamales here."}
{"text":"Doña Maria's has been a place we always come on the day we go back home... like a ritual for us, this place is big nothing fancy and accommodates big parties. Food is decent and the micheladas are really good. It's an ER place for most peeps lol, Cruda central (hangover). Costumer service has always been great and the prices are very reasonable. Parking is great, theirs TV all over just in case you wanna catch a game."}
{"text":"I have passed this Vegas icon by for years.
Fortunately I was stuck in bumper to bumper and directly in front.
Popped in for a dinner
Absolutely fabulous
Authentic Mexican from the decor probably built like years an years
Makes you feel good inside
Tamales with rice and beans
Flan was perfect with a rum after bite
The tamales were filled with chicken and shredded beef
The tastes were just great
Trust me you don't want to miss this experience 
Old school very rare these days"}
{"text":"The food is good not great but pretty good. I think this place is a little over priced which would be okay if the taste was above average. It's a good spot to meet up with a friend and catch up for a bit. If I remember correctly, the bathroom could use a little work (like others have mentioned). If you're used to California tamales, this place probably won't do the trick for you."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Vegas !!! Everything is good breakfast lunch and dinner I had the huevos rancheros fresh coffee the best tamales"}
{"text":"I loved can I say I loved the Tamales.  I make tamales with my family and havent been able to find tamales even close to as good as our tamales.  This place past my expectation in taste.  I loved every bite.  It was a little pricey but well worth it.  

I would have given this place five stars but the waiters weren't very friendly and they were a little slow"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town.

I always get the 2 chicken tacos (shredded chicken) and with all rice (orange color) and no beans. I've never actually tried anything else on the menu. After the 2 chicken tacos I had.. I've been hooked ever since. 

The staff is very attentive and quick. 

They give you free chips and salsa. The salsa does not come with pico."}
{"text":"If could give no stars I would. Terrible food then they still made you pay full price for crappy food. There are tons of good mexican resturaunts in Las Vegas this is not one of them."}
{"text":"the place for tamales at christmas

order by the half or dozen
cheese & green chile
red (pork)
green (chicken)

or really anytime

also excellent breakfast"}

{"text":"I came to have menudo with handmade tortillas.  Being that their specialty are tamales I ordered a cheese and pork tamale. The menudo was great but the tortillas unfortunately were not handmade. What bothered me the most was that the owner argued that they were.  I would've appreciated her honesty. The tamales were not the best.b"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, ordering something different each time, and all dishes have been delicious. Large restaurant with a bar, cool art on the walls along with some old school posters. My Dad took me here, said it was one of the best older mexican joints here in Vegas. He swears by the menudo here, cant get enough. Full range of dishes to choose from and the horchata is on tap!"}
{"text":"Been ordering there for years but recently disappointed ordered a dozen & 1/2 of tamales and 3 were raw. After calling 2x and being on hold the girl tells me \"come in & bring the tamales & I'll exchange them\" not even a sorry or anything!  I've been giving you my business for over 15yrs and that's what I get!!?? Poor customer service"}
{"text":"What happened to this place??????? I haven't been back for a long time maybe about 1 year and I had some good memories of great food not this time food was horrible just because u load everything with cheese don't make it good everything was over cooked even the beans they tasted like they came from a can im so sad this restaurant is what it is now I look so bad because i told my wife and kids it was a amazing place never again will spend money on this one place and u shouldn't  waist yours"}
{"text":"We stopped for a drink and Tamales when walking from Fremont street to the strip. We shared 3 tamales: pork, chicken and cheese. They were all amazing but the cheese was surprisingly our favorite. We ordered margaritas on the rocks (one of my favorites) that were good. We just should have upgraded from house tequila but that was an oversight on our part... they were still good and definitely not from a bottle. The bartender was super nice."}
{"text":"Best tamales!!! I'm from Oklahoma, and when I come to Vegas, I always get a 12 to go!!! Love them!! Green chicken are my fav!!!"}
{"text":"For Las Vegas DMs is about top 3 (as far as mexican restaurants go) easy. Now it's kinda scuzzy over in that area,You should go when the sun is out. 

Get anything you like on the menu it's all good you don't need my help

It's a good breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good things,  the service was excellent and the portions are big. 

The food is terrible.  I wanted to like this place.  But the food was not flavored well and the tamales while huge where very bland. If you are use to mexican food from so cal you will be disappointed here.

The final thing that makes this place bad is the prices, $4.50 for one tamale! Most combos are over 15 dollars.

Sorry but this place is a pass."}
{"text":"I am a native Las Vegan, and this is the best place to get a homemade tamale. Almost like Grandma's! Large, juicy, and full of flavor. By far the best in town for as long as I can remember."}
{"text":"Another Average Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas.....


Dona Maria's is the lovely green eyesore resting near a strip of wedding chapels in the downtown area.  It advertises itself as a Tamales restaurant, but features quite a bit more on the menu.

The best Tamales I've had were wealthy with flavor, prepared with love, and sturdy without being dry.  My excitement for Dona Maria's tamales was met with disappointment, because really they were nothing special.  

I had the Red and the Green tamales.  While both were alright, they lacked vivid flavor and reminded me of lots of Americanized Mexican cuisine in the valley:  good enough.  The flavors in each were a muddles mix of Mexican staples (onion, chili, paprika, etc..)  I wanted to love these tamales, but really wouldn't return for them. 

I also had the Enchiladas Mole.  The mole was rich without being chalky or powdery, suggesting it was made from scratch and not a prepackaged mix.  It tasted more of cocoa than the chiles, which for me was less than wonderful.  I like my mole to be both smoky, spicy, and rich with a touch of sweetness, and these were mostly sweet.  


I can't say that I had a bad meal, since the service was spot on, and the staff was friendly, but the food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Super good in a cool location downtown. Authentic atmosphere and food. Super friendly staff. Great mexican food downtown Las Vegas. What could be better?"}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa. Excellent service. Fajitas were good. However, the beans tasted and looked like canned  re fried beans. Yuck. Rice was okay. I had the Mexican salad. Do not order this.  Salad with 1/4 inch water under it with unripe tomatoes and tough cucumbers, topped with the horrible beans. Pretty much I ate chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Delicious menudo ans pozole! Pork tamales are also very good.  Very moist and they definitely load up on the meat! A MUST every time we come to vegas"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Tacos great! Staff so friendly!  Definitely coming back! George our waiter was best!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place!!! Not only is this one of my favorite places to eat but the food is amazing. Best margaritas you will ever drink!!! Tamales are beyond delish. I'm Mexican and make everything homemade so it's hard to please my Mexican palate. I decided to have our wedding reception here and I couldn't have been happier. Rafael the manager took amazing care of us and my guests. Everyone raved about the food... Thank you Dona's for making our wedding magical. Love the waiter Antonio. Love this place."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick meeting over lunch.  The service was good the food was good Mexican food but nothing special.  The rice and beans were standard.  Great cheese on my burrito! Next time I'll have to try the tamales my colleague's chicken taco salad which looked yummy."}
{"text":"It took me a day to gather my thoughts on this place and write my review.  This is my 2nd visit here, and the first time was a First Friday and it was packed, so I didn't feel I could write an accurate review.

This visit was a Sunday morning when the restaurant had only a dozen or so people dining.  
I just want to start by stating to the servers of the city:  \"If you don't like your job, Nevada is an at-will employment state.  You can quit any time you like, and find other employment more suitable for your interest or skill sets.\"  

On to the food.  The salsa and chips were fresh and tasty.  The guacamole was definitely not very impressive.  Was like creamed avocado dip.  No spice, very little acid, and just left me disappointed.  I enjoyed the ceviche tostada, although it was a little salty.  The red pork tamal was okay.  Overall, this meal was less favorable than a few other chain options for Mexican fare we have available in town.

I think I'll hit a renowned taco shop in the downtown are next time.  Or order my tameles to go.  That seemed to be a trend I saw whilst I was dining."}
{"text":"Can't relate to the negative reviews here ..... been going to Dona Maria over the past 12 years whenever in Las Vegas with a hankering for Mexican ...... always good dependable tasty standard Mexican fare . Good solid burritos,tacos and tasty salsa,rice and refrieds........ quick service..... reasonable pricing...... never had anything but a good,pleasant meal here ."}
{"text":"I stop here every trip to Vegas. Last night my husband and I stopped and it was as delicious as always. I had the carne asada burrito plate with green enchilada sauce. Their chips and salsa are great. I was pleased that the steak didn't have ANY fatty pieces like you sometimes get in Mexican restaurants.  Yum! It was great. Start to finish. The service was great too."}
{"text":"This place is so good. We got a variety of everything and it was just like my mom use to make. The staff was friendly and helpful. We defiantly will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went in on Saturday afternoon and where seated quickly. The chips and salsa were by far better than most other Mexican restaurants ive been to. I decided to get the eggs and chile verde with rice and beans and this dish was just ok, the salsa verde could have used more flavor along with the rice and the beans. The horchata was also good and was homemade so extra points for that. I will try this place again for sure in the future."}
{"text":"Fairly typical Mexican Restaurant, went sort of late on a Tuesday and there were few other customers so things were quiet. Chips were warm and the salsa was good although a bit on the tame side, it could have had a little more heat to it. Good size portions and my enchiladas were very good along with the rice and beans. I didn't try the tamales but plan to when I go back. If you are in the area and hungry deffeinately worth a shot."}
{"text":"My husband and I was looking for a great place with great food for Valentine's day and we found it!
Staff and food were great"}
{"text":"We were told this was the best place for Tamales. Very disappointed. Tamales were dry. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito ,, that was good.

Our server , Magalia, was great."}
{"text":"I was turned off by the smell as I entered. Kind of a damp musty smell. 
The biggest turn off by far though was the pre-formed of the \"store bought\" variety,
Taco shell. In a Mexican restaraunt that makes killer tamales...REALLY???
The beans tasted like the canned refried beans, although they might not have been.
I probably will not return to that location at least."}
{"text":"I wish I could properly express in words just how much I love this place...

I usually hit Las Vegas for a beer fuelled weekend of fun twice a year. I think Las Vegas is a wonderful food city and love it for its many great pizza offerings. However, Dona Maria's Tamales is the one MUST for me on every Vegas trip.

I love Mexican food. And I really love Tamales when they are done properly. These are the best I have personally ever had. The chicken verde are my favourite, followed closely by the cheese. Homemade and always perfect.

The homemade salsa they serve with chips when you sit down is the greatest salsa I've had. I could drink that stuff by the pitcher. Seriously. I always have to hold back not filling up on chips and salsa before my Tamales arrive.

The staff here are always fantastic. Dona Maria's Tamales is always a chill hangout for us on a hectic Vegas weekend ... a place to unwind, eat great food and sip a few Victoria Cerveza or high octane margaritas before moving on to our next adventure. We love you guys!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to come eat and get amazing hot fresh Mexican food every time. The service is great, the restaurant is very clean. Can't earlier after 6 years in Vegas, I finally came here. Employee Estella has been cleaning the whole time, answering phones and smiling to the customers, she's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Excellent meal. I had the shredded beef tamales. Large portions! Friendly staff! Great mango margaritas."}
{"text":"Oh man is all I can say food was on point and some of the best Mexican food I have had!! Will recommend it to everyone I see!!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken tamales and cheese. Not very impressed. They were a little soggy. The service was great! Quick and very polite. The menudo had a smell to it that didn't seem right. My husband loved the queso fundido."}
{"text":"Stopped on for lunch after a discussion with group about tamales.  I used to dine quit frequently at the DM's at Tenaya location.  God, how I would stuff myself with tamales containing beef or chicken or cheese.  They even have a desert tamale with cinnamon and raisins.  But I am older now and don't eat to excess so it's been awhile and we were closer to the DT location.

Pleanty of seating at this location so coming in at lunch time was not an issue.  The service was great, we must have had five different people stop to fill glasses, drop off chips, and just wee how things were going.

I ordered up a cheese tamale w/ beef taco.  Both were tasty as I washed them down with horchata."}
{"text":"My favorite happy hour stop. pitchers are $12 and they make it really strong  can't go wrong with this local place and have amazing tamales."}
{"text":"I cam here and got the tamale special, it is 2 tamales (I got 1 cheese and 1 pork) they come covered in enchilada sauce with a side or rice and beans. You also get a choice of soup or salad (I got soup). 

The feeling of this restaurant is very traditional and the service was great, the horchata has UNLIMITED refills. 

I personally enjoyed the meatball soup, the meatballs had flavor and seasoned great. I just wish I had more squash but that is personal preference. 

The tamales were great, super loaded not a lot of masa. The rice had full of flavor and seasoning and the beans were great as well. I will be back here and will try more food. I want to explore the menu as I have been missing good mexican food. Maybe this place with scratch the itch that has been missing from my palette."}
{"text":"When trying to decide where to catch the  World Cup game and enjoy lunch central to both our locations, my husband and I settled on Dona Maria. We sat at the bar and ordered a diet coke and my pregnancy drink of choice, raspberry ice tea. The staff was courteous enough, although we waited about 10-15 for the menus to be brought over. 
The complimentary chips and salsa tasted very complimentary -stale chips and salsa that tasted like marinara sauce. We opted for 6 tamales (pork, beef, cheese, chicken x2 and \"sweet\").  I had beef and chicken, and thought they were ok but slightly dry. I had to drench them in cholula sauce for added moisture.  Also the tamales were relatively small. The tab was close to $25 which is pretty standard for a mid range quality restaurant. I'd say this was purely a convenience thing and based on the food I would have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"Great service! I stopped during a trip and I loved it, the coffee is prepared with cinnamon, como en México!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Awesome food good portions nice atmosperic reatauraunt reasonable pricing great food kudos"}
{"text":"Do not recommend. Tried the quilaquiles. Horrible soggy mess. Looked and tasted like the had used the table salsa as their sauce. Not to mention waiter took out order and we never saw him again. Worst Mexican food place in las Vegas for sure. Will not revisit."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. They are known for their tamales but they weren't anything special- service is friendly, margs are tasty :) More on the touristy side and ok for families..can be a little pricey."}
{"text":"My husband and i came here for our 1 year anniversary. Our server was Jorge, he was on top of everything from our drinks to our main meal. I ordered the pork tamales and my husband ordered the beef tamales. We were not disappointed. The tamales were stuffed with tamale filling the refried beans were yummy as well as the spanish rice. Will definitely come back. I have not had as good of tamales since i moved from Texas until i came and ate at Dona Marias. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"AWESOME place for authentic Mexican food. Order the shrimp cocktail, super fresh with good size shrimp. We ordered chicken, pork, cheese tamales. The masa is great, light & flavorful.
If you want authentic Mexican food, try this place. Clean, well lit and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Disappointed . The tortilla soup came out room temperature, so it was microwaved and brought back. Seafood enchiladas were cool but a bit warmer than room temp. Chili relleno was good but had a cold sauce. I do not trust the cook. He will cause someone to get seriously ill."}
{"text":"Food was great. Tamales were tasty and the rice tasted just like my moms. But there was one major problem today when I went in by myself for lunch... 
I got up to use the restroom and when I came back, a family of 4 was sitting at my table and my food was gone! I was livid! I literally had excused myself for 2 minutes. The girl in the front didn't offer an apology and the manager did nothing about clearing my table and food.
 Food is good. Customer service is terrible!"}
{"text":"Just driving by and saw 'Tamales'.. sounded good, so what the heck, why not?

Of course we opted to try the Tamales:

Red - pork in a mild sauce
Green - chicken in a spicy sauce

Both weren't dry/mushy and had the right crumble when the knife sliced into it. I liked the Red Tamale better maybe because of the pork, not necessarily the sauces. The Green had a mild kick but wasn't bad. 

4/5 stars for the Tamales

I also had to try their Carne Asada as I usually order this at every Mexican place I go to, especially the first time. It was quite disappointing, just didn't do it for me. But their Tamales, definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Good food not great. Terrible service. Rude waitress. Will not be back. Not sure how they stayed open 35 years"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place since it's one of the only Mexican restaurants within walking distance of Fremont.  But the food was just run of the mill.  Nothing amazing.  

Tamales were 3 stars.  Everything else I've tried on the menu (enchiladas, tacos and burrito) drags the place down to two stars.  If it weren't in the run down part of downtown, I'm not sure Dona Maria's would still be around."}
{"text":"Oh my God. SO SO delicious. Chips and salsa were perfect, margarita was amazing, tamales so yummy, beans were perfection. Couldn't ask for a better dinner."}
{"text":"Well I gotta say for me is A must go every time me and my husband go to Vegas .service is a plus food is delicious is fast and a nice clean place .."}
{"text":"Really tasty food. Their cafe de la olla is a must try!! Had the enchilada style burrito with shredded beef also very good but it was a little too much for me. My friend had albondigas and that was soooooo yummy!"}
{"text":"food          3.5 to 4 *
service      3 *

While in Vegas, I got to go the many places and few made the list, some were bad, some good and some shouldn't be open if you asked me.

Dona Maria's has good food and bad service. we get there and waited for a few minutes to be seated. We sat in the back, close to the kitchen. It was a group of 6. some ordered shrimp soup, steak and shrimp, I got the tamal chile relleno combo. Almost everything was good, but what I got. I just decided that I should not get chiles rellenos at a restaurant because even if they are good they will never be as good as my family's recipe so, and also the tamal was ..... how can I put it? big, lots of corn masa, lots of dry chicken breast with almost no sauce at all. I was surprised because they do have tamal on the name so I guess not doing justice to it. every tamal is priced at over $4, really??? I could get 3 better bigger tamales for that $$ at my usual spot (lol not Vegas I guess)

The menu was extensive, unorganized and repetitive.

The service was kinda bad. Two people in the party ordered dished that came with tortillas, well only one of us got the tortillas really late in the dinner and they were cold.

The place is big colorful with a bar and decor that does not go with the rest of the place.

DMTR OK to good food, bad service avoid the tamales."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a child and let me tell you, having been raised on these tamales, nothing beats it. I've been to many places and none of them are as good as here. I always go for the chicken, but the pork and cheese are good to. If you want a restaurant that provides amazing food, great service, and low prices, Dona Maria's Tamales is the place to go."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for over 40 years. Excellent food amazing service. Original food scratch made each day. 
When in Vegas and you want the finest Mexican food here is the place to go.greatest good on the planet . I am going to move back to Vegas just to eat here each week."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Mexican restaurant for 13 years but, tonight I found a cocker roach in my tamale!! I know this location is old but, if your roaches mix with the food this is a bad thing!! Feeling very sad because we love true food but just can't go back:("}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this restaurant was how authentic it felt as soon as you walked in! Service was great. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. 
I ordered the lunch special which was two tamales, rice and beans. I chose two chicken tamales, one with red sauce and one with green sauce. What I didn't realize was how huge the tamales are! The tamales are good, but not the best I've ever had. I think that the sauce that is put on top of the tamale is what gives them the flavor. The red sauce taste like an enchilada sauce, and was not spicy. And the green sauce was ok. The rice and beans were good though. 

Over all, the food was good. Very, very filling!"}
{"text":"If you like Southern California Mexican food you will not like this place. Better yet,  if you love tamales Los Angeles style save your money and eat elsewhere. I really wanted to like this place but I was very disappointed.

$4.50 for a tamale is just outrageous, specially since it was tasteless. I had the special of the day which was a pork tamale with the chile relleno with rice and beans. The chile relleno was pretty good, the tamale lacked so much! Where do I begin? There was plenty of meat,  but seriously no flavor whatsoever. No salt, tasted like just plain pork meat that was stewed in its own juices. The beans were subpar. Rosarita canned beans are amazing compared to these. The rice was meh. My daughter had the quesadilla with corn tortilla instead of flour with rice and beans and that (quesadilla) was way better than my tamale. 

I'm sorry Doña Maria, you really need to step up your game in the seasoned tamales. A bit of Knorr bouillon seasoning would go a long way."}
{"text":"We wanted Mexican food on our last night in Vegas so we came here. It's not far from downtown. The margaritas here are the best I've tasted in Vegas, finally a margarita with tequila! I ordered the chicken fajitas and my wife had a couple of chicken tostadas. The food portions were huge and filling. We enjoyed our dinner here and would gladly come back again. If you need a margarita fix then try this place. The places on the strip suck!"}
{"text":"I will never come to Vegas without visiting again. Incredibly hard workers. Margaritas are the bomb, get the pitcher it's $2 more than two glasses and about 3x as many.  Beautifully decorated. They made me nopales con Juevos (eggs with cactus).  This place rocks."}
{"text":"The tamales are the best I've ever had but I'm forced to say two stars due to the horrible service we have gotten two separate times. The waiter (older man with glasses) truly acts like you are bothering him and is beyond rude. As a matter of fact everyone in the restaurant acts like you are bothering them. When we went, it was not busy but yet they speed past you, slam your food down and never come back until it's time to slam your check down. There was no \"thanks\" \"please come back\" nothing. Save yourself and drive the extra few miles to the Cheyenne and Tenaya location, they actually provide excellent service."}
{"text":"Awesome tamales! Had the beef and pork. Burritos were good. Beef enchilada was great...5 people and everyone enjoyed their meal (raves for the steak tacos). Great service too!"}
{"text":"Been eating there tamales since I was a kid, so good!  But the last couple time I have gotten tamales the have been heavy on the corn meal and light on the meat.  I truely hope it was a new cook or something along those line.  But I have  feeling the are being \"cost effective\".  Still good but not at the level they use to be at"}
{"text":"decent. took our server a while to get us our check and they wer not busy at all. but the food was good. im sure  the service is better on different days."}
{"text":"I have always liked this place. However, their prices are getting ridiculous for Mexican food. They charge more than $4.00 for one tamale. Really? My grandmother made hers from scratch and I know the ingredients don't cost that much. I would rather support that entrepreneur who shows up in his white unmarked van in the parking lot of Wal-Mart. He sells his for $1.00, and they are tasty. OK - so I am a little trusting. 

I usually opt for the Chile Verde burrito (a la cart) because I refuse to spend the 15-20 dollars they ask for -on most of their entrees. The burrito is simple -Chile Verde, onions and beans.  Don't get me wrong, the burrito is good - but not $10.00 good.

The reason I keep coming back is that I like the old school vibe it has inside (at least at this location). Plus, the chips and salsa are fantastic. 

There are half dozen Mexican restaurants in the area that I enjoy better than this place. If they keep raising their prices, they may drop off my radar altogether. 

Hmmm, it's about time I go visit my tamale guy."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with the wife.  Food was ok, not spectacular but not the worst I've had.   My taco was a bit greasy but the shredded beef was well seasoned.   The wife had an enchilada and said the sauce was tasty.  Beans and rice were both very good.  My biggest complaint was the service - marginal, at best.  The waiter seemed annoyed by my request for an extra napkin and our glasses never got refilled.  I'm usually a good tipper, but that guy got a measly $1 from me on a $25 ticket.  On the plus side, the food only took about 10 minutes to arrive once ordered."}
{"text":"Don't order the chimichanga, covered with all lettuce and stuffed with air. Crap!!! Tamales, ok! 
My friends told me it wasn't that expensive, well I paid almost $40 for an order of 6 tamales, 1 soup and a drink."}
{"text":"A place like this calls for numbered issues:

1. The dinner special (Tamales, Enchilada Style) was way too salty. 

2. The tortillas were very obviously store bought; they were served dry and hard. 

3. The micheladas are nothing but your choice of beer with Bloody Mary mix. This was especially disappointing bc we were craving micheladas. You can find better ones at Bonito Michoacan. 

4. The menudo was extremely bland. The broth tasted like watered down ramen soup BEFORE you put the seasoning in. The actual tripe was very soggy. I may be wrong but I think this means they didn't cook it long enough? Either way, it's not the way I like it. You can get better menudo at Pepe's Tacos.

5. Are we having a lime shortage again? Not one lime seen, but lemons galore. In the menudo, the food, and the micheladas. No lime.  

6. The salad that is offered with your food was comical. Store-bought cheese and half a tomato placed on top (not even diced up).

The chips and salsa are good. I leave this restaurant with a full stomach of that. Unfortunately nothing else left a great impression and we will not be returning. For the prices this place offers, I would expect the food to be a lot better. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The best Tamales in Las Vegas, hands down. I grew up eating at this place and every time I come back home I make my required visit."}
{"text":"After hearing from everyone & his/her brother & sister about this place AND seeing in the paper how its a huge local Christmas tradition to stop by and pick up 100's of tamales at a time, I decided to try it out for myself.

I wanted to go in and sit down but unfortunatly my time was pressed & I got a Chicken Tamale to go. The price was kinda high at $4.15.....$2.75 would be more reasonable BUT it is what it is. When I got home I was surprised to see a big bag of warm homemede tortilla chips & some mild sauce. This made the price a little better and the Tamale did not dissappoint.

I look forward to going back & sitting down & trying a combination platter & reviewing it here....stay tuned"}
{"text":"It's been said already:

These are the best tamales you will ever taste.

Dona Maria's been hanging around downtown since 1980 on the corner of Charleston and Las Vegas Boulevard.  It's not the most visited of areas, especially for dining, and Dona Maria's has been here and packed for almost 30 years.  They recently opened another restaurant in Summerlin so you won't have to drive your nice car downtown (wasn't that sweet?)  The reason why it's done so well are the tamales.  They are out of this world.  They come in pork, chicken and cheese with expertly crafted sauces.  The rest of the menu is great as well - just good Mexican food - but really, people come here for the tamales."}
{"text":"Amazing tamales as always!  My family has been coming here for about 40 years.   Not always at this location...used to just be a walk up counter back in the 70's.  I live in Colorado now but nobody's tamales even come close to Doña Maria's.   I bring home two dozen each time I visit.  The chicken are my favorite but the pork are also great."}
{"text":"Being a tamale lover I had to try this place and was not disappointed!! Husband and I split 3 - chose the chicken, pork and beef.  Chicken and pork were my favorites!! Meat to corn ratio was perfect- staff was friendly, my margarita was great and hubby loved their horchata!! Great salsa also"}
{"text":"So good. Their coffee has cinnamon in it and it's the best. I had 3 full cups. The tortilla soup was scrumptious and the census from the family was that the menudo was very satisfying. The tamales oh my gosh they were so delicious. Very moist. I would definitely hit this spot again ."}
{"text":"We have passed by this restaurant many times and always said that we bet that dive-looking place has the best Mexican food. So tonight we tried it. We won't go back. We got a margarita. It was strong, which is unusual so it had that going for it, but that was it. The mix had no flavor, not lime or even sweet. Weird. The chips and salsa were good. People on Yelp had said that. I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos. The menu said 3 and there were only 2. The fish was very over cooked. There was supposed to be a mango salsa. I guess there were a few mangos there. There was so much mayonnaisey something on it that it ruined it. Just overall icky. It came with \"grilled\" veggies which were Birds Eye at best and not grilled. The rice was white with peas. Way too much butter. I only picked out the edible pieces of fish and left the rest on the plate. All that for $19.00. My husband ordered a steak and enchilada plate with green sauce on the enchilada. The steak was chewy and although there was green sauce on the enchilada there was red sauce inside. What? The waiter should have mentioned this. The Mexican rice was too tomatoey. He didn't even finish his food. Not once did the waiter come to our table after the food was brought. When another waiter came to take the plates he asked if I wanted a box. I said no. He didn't bother to ask if there was something wrong. I had planned to order a tamale to go just to try it based on the reviews. Honestly, by that time I just didn't care. Side note: We overheard the people in the next booth ask for limes and the waiter told them they only had lemons not limes. What?? A Mexican restaurant that doesn't have limes? 
We sure haven't had much luck finding a good Mexican restaurant here. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Just so you know...my dad first brought me here when I was in grade school and I have been coming back ever since.(I'm 48 now) The best tamales ever!!!! I moved away to Oregon for 13 years and was on a quest... telling people of the awesome tamales I knew in Vegas, I got lots of suggestions but nothing compared to the pork tamales I grew up with, and now that I'm back in Vegas this is a regular stop for me. The rest of their food is OK but nothing beats those Tamales"}
{"text":"Can you say - Horrible Service = The staff get caught up in their own conversation therefore the food sits longer then it should. I was not given what I ordered. Part of the food items on my plate were cool. The quality of service and food has not been up to standards."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. Always good. Guacamole is awesome. Service is spot on. Wait staff is friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"The place was really nice, however, the customers need to mind their own business!  The waiters really need to pay attention to the order and get it correct!  The shrimp tacos were fantastic!  The guacamole was really good too!!!"}
{"text":"Good horchata. Good service. Food was a little better than okay. For a place with Tamales in the name of the restaurant, my expectations far exceeded my experience."}
{"text":"Wack. 1 star minus 1 star. Do the math. Lunchtime. Sat at bar. Service and treatment received forced me to submit this review. I never review but as a public service, here i am. go somewhere else. You. Are. Welcome.

Now i have to go submit 5 good reviews on other restaurants to get rid of this negative energy. Woooosahhh"}
{"text":"This place has the best tamales outside of Mexico!!  After we arrived in Vegas, we headed straight for Dona Maria.  I had 2 chicken tamales in red and green sauce and they were amazing!  The chicken is so finely chopped  that it literally melts in your mouth.  The sauces are also fantastic.  My husband ordered the chilequiles which was also excellent.  The guacamole dip is also delicious and huge for the price.

We loved our meal so much that we came back 4 days later.  Don't miss this wonderful restaurant when you're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I only let my old lady eat here once a year, otherwise the bitch would be 300 lbs. And if that ain't a good enough endorsement for ya, how about this: I was having lunch there one afternoon while a nice Latino gentleman was painting the mural. While I sucked down my chips and salsa, he painted a farm-hand's mustache  with chiaroscuro outbursts of vigor reminiscent of Picasso himself. Foolishly, I yelled, \"Make it bigger!!!\"

He looked at me perplexed.

\"Make the mustache bigger, señor!\"

He smiled. 

I was in a friendly place."}
{"text":"Four Stars are for the tamales and the soup.  Everything else is good, but not up to par with the wonder Mexican food closer to the border (much less in Mexico). 

The staff tends to be friendly there and I was generous with the stars because I do think they should thrive as a business---though they should cut down the menu a bit.

Buy the tamales in bulk for a small group, or even more for a bbq or a party--it's much more cost efficient that way and they heat up nicely."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Is My Favorite !!! 
But the Chile Relleno was dissapointing
But the tamales are great !"}
{"text":"We have gone here twice for dinner. Wonderful service both times! The servers are quick and attentive and food and drinks come out fast! Food is pretty tasty too. Good guac, good salsa, and good enchiladas! Their jumbo margaritas are really strong too - plan accordingly if you order one! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My family & I fully ENJOYED this place. After a \"VEGAS\" weekend starting on Thursday & doing family things, toys place was cozy, comforting & almost peaceful. The background Latin music was soothing & not in my ear.  The food was GREAT!!! We will definitely be visiting again when we revisit Vegas as couple.  Menudo small was just right size & delicious, Huevos Rancheros was good, & beef tamale was good. \"Champurrado chocolate was the bomb,\"  my kids words."}
{"text":"Overpriced and food is mediocre at best. The tamales are good but were just thrown on a plate with old rice and beans. Had to ask for the salsa that they said were served with them. Sucks when the best part of your meal is the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"The fajitas were 5 star...so why just a 1 star rating?

1. Location...it is technically on the strip but it is the nasty part between the Stratosphere and the Sahara.

2.The service...it sucked in a major way. The only clients that were getting proper attention were the 2 business men seated next to us. Otherwise the waitresses are lazy at their job.

3.The food...other than my fajitas, EVERYTHING ELSE was Taco Bell grade at best. Very cold food. The \"famous\" tamales were just gross. Dry old masa with gummy slightly slimy texture meat...old frozen and microwaved I imagine. Yuck.

4. The silverware looked to be dirty. Good thing I had tortillas to use."}
{"text":"This place is still good eats!!! I'm from San Diego and this Mexican food was just as good as we have in diego . I'd highly recommend this place again to any one . 

It had been several years since I was last here like 5-6 yeas ago and I wasn't sure at first but they didn't disappoint us at all . 

If you want good Mexican food , close to the strip, and reasonably prices here's your place go check them out I know I will be goin back when I visit again !!!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago for breakfast. 

The free chips and salsa we got were sooo good! The chips were so light and crispy and the salsa was perfect with it! I couldn't get enough of them.

Our waiter was pretty attentive as well. He kept filling up our glasses of water when they were only halfway. The only problem with drinks that I had was that I ordered an orange juice and it came in such a small little glass and it was like 3 bucks!

I ordered the huevos a la mexicana and he ordered the Machaca con huevo. I really enjoyed my food, it was so authentic and ooh soo good!  Our plates both came with tortillas on the side. We got the flour tortillas instead of the corn and they were so fresh and so yummy! I could eat them as a snack!  

I would definitely recommend their Mexican breakfast, just beware of the pricey OJ!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mexican food I would recommend this place. The service is great the people are friendly the food was okay. I ordered tacos and like tacos I expected a flour tortilla or corn I did ask for flower and I got a hard shell. Didn't really eat it cause it wasn't that good. The rice and beans it came with were okay."}
{"text":"When I first started coming here, it was a 5 star joint. When I came back this weekend, I see it for the 3 1/2 star-red joint it now is. It's unfortunate. The server no longer take the time to converse with the patrons to make them feel welcomed. The complimentary chips were crumbs. Quite literally, crumbs. They fell through the holes of the basket. They never refilled my salsa and chips like they used to even though he SAW (and yes, I know for a fact he saw it because he looked right at it) that it was pretty much empty. After bringing us our order, he basically never came back again until he saw that we were finished with our food. Um, thanks for nothing, jerk! I'm not going to tip you more for coming right before we ask for the check!

That's just service. As for the food, a bit salty. I'm embarrassed to have dragged my friends here swearing they've got the best tamales ever. FAILED."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that this place only has a 3 1/2 star average on yelp. I love this place and so have all of my friends that I have brought here. The food is excellent and the staff is friendly. What more could one want."}
{"text":"Worst tamales i have ever had.  We went and ordered the special, tamales with beans and rice.  The tortilla chips and dip they bring out is nice, but it took them quite some time to get the food ready.  The tamales were dry, certainly not cooked the same day, the rice was bland and overcooked.  And all that covered with bad sauce and heated up it a microwave most likely... Because the plates themselves were as hot as the food.  Never going back, not recommending.  Vegas has much better places than that."}
{"text":"Yes, their Tamales are really good.

I knew that a place like this in Vegas had to be better than anything on the strip. It's always great to eat like the locals. I ordered their burrito with tamale dish and was more than satisfied at the end of my meal; that pork tamale was really delicious! The burrito was really fat and unfortunately filled with refried beans (I prefer black beans). What's nice too is that they serve crisp tortilla chips with tasty salsa while you order your meal."}
{"text":"They proclaim to have the Best Tamales but they are mehhh

I had the 2 Tamale lunch plate, Green Chicken and Red Pork.  The pork tamale was definitely better.  It was more moist and had more flavor.  I found the chicken to be dry and lacked kick.

I ordered an additional taco for $2.35 and it was decent at best.

On another visit, I had the menudo and was pretty pleased.  

The chicken fajitas were pretty tasty as well.

All in all, it's a decent spot.  3 stars....4 stars at best.  There has to be a better tamale in Vegas.....The search continues..."}
{"text":"Doña Maria's is a classic family-style Mexican restaurant, from the grey vinyl booths to the \"cantina\" inspired decor. From the outside it doesn't look like much...a squat, dusty building with bars on the windows. Yet, considering that it's been around since 1980--practically Biblical times in Vegas years--you know it's probably pretty decent. 

I arrived for happy hour at 4:00, walking from the nearby bus stop. Other reviewers have (accurately) described the neighborhood as dicey, but it's perfectly fine in the afternoon. I ordered a jumbo lime margarita for $4.95 which was roughly the size of my head. It was far from a masterpiece, but certainly got the job done!

The chips & salsa were fair--chunky corn chips in a thick, fruity salsa. I followed up with a bean & cheese burrito. In addition to being one of my favorite dishes, it's a surprisingly reliable benchmark of quality. It arrived, somewhat alarmingly, in two minutes. The presentation was straight out of 1983, replete with the decorative lettuce and tomato garnish that inexplicably accompanies Mexican platters. It was fairly tasty--dripping with melted jack-- and I nibbled for about an hour as I emptied my glass. 

Apart from happy hour, it's not especially cheap. with a la carte lunch entrees in the $10 range and seafood dishes exceeding $17. While hardly outrageous, I personally expect a bit more individual attention and detail for these prices. Nonetheless, I'll probably return to Doña Maria's and write up a full review of their eponymous tamales."}
{"text":"Ever walked into an old establishment and feel like you leave needing  shower...welcome to Dona Maria. It's plain damp feeling and just unpleasant. The food was OK but being  regular lunch eater in the downtown area I'm glad I waited so long to try this place and it will be a long time before I try it again. Sorry!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today.  Tamales were very good.  Food overall was good, but not great (but not bad either).  My wife has an avocado allergy and the menu did not disclose that the tacos came with guacamole on them so it would be nice if the menu were clearer.

There are over two dozen well priced combos, breakfast items, and a full bar.  I'd go back.  It was good."}
{"text":"Yes it's good!  Took a chance that this local hole in the wall would be good and was not disappointed! 

Pozole is yummmmmm... And tamales were good too!  And the pozole was amazing!!!! Oh and the pozole was...

Definitely going here every time I'm in vegas!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious my fav are the chilaquiles verdes they are a lil spicy but very flavorful. The coffee is good especially after a night out. Been coming here since last year its a must while in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Salsa enfuego!

I love this place.  After years of living on the East Coast, Dona Maria's got my fiance' to eat Mexican food.  I started him on the chips and worked him up to the tamales.  

This is also a great place to bring out of town guests who don't want Strip crap.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"1. Horrible and unfriendly service
2. Took almost half an hour to get food
3. \"Shredded beef\" taco, not recommended
4. Single tamale is NOT worth $5, should be $2.50 TOPS

Used to be a much better and friendlier place. Last years experience wasnt the best, but i gave them the benefit of the doubt. They only confirmed that its getting worse, wont be going or recommending this place anymore."}
{"text":"I always come here before heading to work. I get my frozen mango margarita, the BEST in town by far for the price and size. Its Vegas, you pay too much for any alcoholic crap on the strip anyways.
But this place does not pull your money out of your pocket.

Food is always fast, service is ok, its a family style so there is a lot of chattering sometimes late and not much paying attention to late night alcoholics like me :)

The only down was once, when I spilled my new drink and was not offered a refill or replacment free or cheaper. It was totally ignored.

Oh well... othetr than that I always had good food and strong drinks there.

its tricky to pull in from las vegas blvd and charleston, so go on 4th from charleston and pull in from the back."}
{"text":"Unexpected local find on our way to see gold and silver \"Pawn Stars\" shop. Service was great, servers were friendly and knowledgeable. Mexican food was authentic and drinks were awesome. Try the strawberry margarita made with real strawberries not the flavored crap you get on the strip for $20 bucks. Prices were reasonable. Would definitely go back. It's not a \"fancy\" place but it's good food from friendly people at a reasonable price!"}

GASTROintestinal distress ... guaranteed 

The WORST Taco ever .. 
Bad enchilada , the Tamale was so-so

There are so many choices for Mexican food ( like Taco Bell ) skip this place"}
{"text":"This rating is for their Big Fat Meaty light Delicious TAMALES.  The best I've ever had outside of a private home.  Light Masa, Flavorful, Beautiful.

The balance of the menu is a little Gringoized for my taste.  Too many ingredients in the tacos.  Guacamole too creamy etc.  But the Pico de gallo chopped salsa is realy nice.  They put cinnamon in their carnitas which I dont like...but the carnitas were meaty and juicy none the less. Id give the restaurant as a whole four stars.  My problems are more with style than quality. The quality of everything I tried was uniformly high.

But the TAMALES are WORLD CLASS. ...and I know tamales.  Ive eaten them in four countries and know the styles.  These to me seem like Jalisco/Nayarit. (Mexico)

I ordered 12 dozen a day ahead and they made them up for me and froze them so I could drive them home to LA.  Now I'm set for Christmas Eve.  We always make some but since the average visitor to the casa Hollywood eats about 4....it's nice to have a backup supply of the good stuff.

My favorite way to eat them is \"a la comal\"...meaning that they are steamed first (as always)...allowed to rest...and then crisped in a non stick pan.  You kind of squish them down in the pan so that more of the masa is in contact and then treat them like a pile of hash.  DONT ADD ANY OIL!!  The manteca comes out of the masa and allows everythign to get a little crispy.  You can start them in the pan with the corn husk still on and then sort of shake the tamale out ofthe husk once it heats up a little.  Then just squish it with your spatula and let it cook.  Hard to burn so High heat is ok.

I asked for them to be prepared this way as an appetizer in the restaurant and they did it for me.  I would skip the \"enchilada style\" thing they offer.  Tamales, like oysters, (and women), should be enjoyed with minimal additional complication.  The simple essential item is as good as it can be.

After transfer to a dish I like to drizzle mine (tamale I mean..;) with Blanca's smokey tomatillo/Chile Japonese salsa.  Increible.

I'm convinced that this is the way the Tamale was intended to be eaten.

BITE IT and see."}
{"text":"Not among the best Mexican restaurants in town. 

I had the fajitas while my mother got a combo with a chile relleno and enchilada. We asked for bean dip as an appetizer which came out as plate of refried beans with a little cheese on top...weak. 

My chicken fajitas were just ok. Chicken wasnt the most flavorful or moist but were edible with the toppings. My mom didnt care for hers and left most of it on the plate. 

The establishment itself was beyond empty. Not a good sign for 6-7p on a Friday night in the burgeoning downtown region. Not to mention it had that smell of \"old\", no music and extremely harsh bright lights."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was outstanding. Make sure to try the coffee here it is not like any other you have had before it has a hint of chocolaty/ cinnamon taste that is addicting. If your in Vegas for a visit you should plan on coming to this place."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place got these reviews! Look at the tables graute how dirty and black it is. This place stinks really bad. The food is not authentic Mexican food, you can tell its out of a can or box. The tamales were reheated several times and did not have a good flavor. You can tell how old a Tamal by the leaf"}
{"text":"I ordered #22 the famous pork tamale and the cheese enchilada. It was very disappointing. Too much cheese on top of everything and salty. The tamale had a conchinita pabil type stringy pork with an unusual flavor and the rice had an herb that was very different flavor. I have lived in Guadalajara and Mexico City and now live near some of the best Mexican restaurants in Santa Ana and Costa Mesa California so I think I have a good pallet when it comes to Mexican food and I have to say Dona Maria is an Gringo version of Mexican food \"not authenic\"."}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant in the middle of a not so desirable part of the strip. But don't judge a book by its cover here people! 

Came here for breakfast before my flight home and enjoyed a variety of house specialties, ordered both their chicken and their pork tamales, the chile rellenos platter and made to order vanilla custard filled churros. The pork tamale was a bit dry and flavorless whereas the chicken variety was really wonderful and seasoned perfectly. So perfect that I had them pack up 3 more for my long plane ride back to the east coast! Vanessa my waitress was even so nice to take each of the Tamales out of their husk wrapping and gently placed them in a sealed foil wrapping before putting them in their styrofoam to go container so I wouldn't have any leakage issues.

The Chile rellenos platter was so delicious and filling, I could not stop eating it. A large poblano pepper stuffed with cheese then topped with more cheese, who can say no to that kind of deliciousness! They offer the usual plain Cinnamin sugar dusted churros and then they also offer one that is filled with rich sweet vanilla crème. A beautiful light golden fried piece of stretched dough, it was the perfect way to end my successful Vegas business trip.

I'm really excited to get back there in my next visit and try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times and always during your typical weekday lunch hour. The service is always good and the employees are friendly and pleasant. My most recent trip was no different. I went with a co-worker and was under the impression we were ordering lunch specials, as noted on the menu. More on that in a minute. 

The chips and salsa arrived in quick fashion. The chips were good, but the salsa had a spicy marinara taste. It was like dipping your chips in spicy spaghetti sauce. My partner ordered enchiladas, which he seem to devour in short order. I got two tacos and opted for shredded beef. My dish came with rice and beans. I asked for all beans and no rice. The waiter was quick to say \"no problemo\" and delivered on his promise. 

The down side here is that the tacos came in shells very reminiscent of Taco Bell or Del Taco. If I wanted those I would have gone THERE and paid pennies on the dollar. Lunch for two was north of $30 with no alcohol. There are plenty of other places in the downtown area to do lunch, so if I were to return it wouldn't be for lunch, I wouldn't order tacos and there would be libations involved."}
{"text":"It's to over priced ,the food was great but wouldn't come in at all .waitress was with a a very frustrated face.."}
{"text":"Best tamales you can buy if you can't get your abuela's tamales! Every time I've ever bought tamales in a restaurant they've always come up short but these tamales have great flavor and not dry. Our co-worker brought in the chicken and green sauce tamales and they were great."}
{"text":"Take out is not good.  I ordered a chicken enchilada and taco plate.  My taco was a soggy mess and so was the shredded chicken.  Runny and watery, it did not taste good at all.  All I could eat were the rice and beans.  I'm so disappointed because I dined in before, had the same order and remember it being good.  This food was not fresh, even the salsa was nasty.  Whatever you do, do not get your food to go."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a three but they redeemed themselves in their ability to correct a problem with their food.  A friend mine ordered the menudo and it was very salty. The waiter quickly corrected the problem to my friend's satisfaction. In the past the menudo here has been great. I think this was just a bad day for the menudo.  Every other dish ordered that day was good.  Be warned this place is not in the best area of Las Vegas so if you go late at night just be aware of your surroundings. I will definitely keep Dona Maria Tamales on my list of places to eat when I go to Vegas. Its not gourmet but it definitely satisfies my taste for good mexican food."}
{"text":"When you search VegasYelp for Tamales Dona Maria's is the first to come up. Good reason too these hot Tamales are straight up the best. Everyone out here seems to have \"a Tamale guy.\" As fore mentioned Tamale's have always fallen short of my expectations. 
 I was lucky enough to have stopped by the downtown area over the weekend. I knew I was going and I need to have some sort of a sub plot and decided a Tamale mission would be the right thing to do. It was.
 Dona Maria's is one of the few places that I've been to Vegas that has an \"established feel\" to it. You know you are in for something good when you get in the place. We rocked the whole Tamale scene there. The Red, The green, the cheese, and the desert all are above and beyond. You can't miss Dona Maria's."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorite places to go when we go to vegas . The food is great here .All my family stop here when they come to vegas .As for the food its great !!!.And every one is nice here ."}
{"text":"Came in here on a Thursday around noon, ordered some enchiladas with eggs. So delicious and filling comes with side of rice and beans. Get to chose from red or green totally recommend then green. Service was good but felt I had the need to put a review in appreciation towards the server assistant which was a gentlemen. Felt he went out of his way to help. My grandmas wasn't feeling so well so asked for a up of hot water and lemon if he could squeeze the lemon for her. I told my grandma \"no he doesn't do that I'll do it for you\"
He still brought the squeezed lemon with hot water. Appreciate him going out of his ways to helping a customer!"}
{"text":"I have been to both locations both of which have their own ups and downs. Even though I was panhandled at the one location the waiter watched me get into my car. The tamales were awesome I like then mello because for me you never know the persons taste who made the order. I have been there many years ago and still go seldomly. I love it"}
{"text":"The Enchiladas Ranceras  and Strawberry Mango Margaritas were amazingly delicious.  The end"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. First day I had steak and carnitas tacos and they both were alright. The carnitas was dried up like it was made a week ago and I didn't even have the stomach to try the steak. The service was good. The next day, I had posole which was kinda good but they put too much flavor. It was too salty."}
{"text":"Continues to be a great place to find good food. Dine-in or take-out it's easy to park as they have free parking which now a days downtown is a bit rare. Great lunch specials and of course you must have the tamales when you come here. A bit on the pricy side but they are big and overall great tamales, especially when you  are craving a tamal!"}
{"text":"If there was a negative 1 I would give it to them,coffee and my champurrado was warm,not hot,same with my tamales,service was OK,but not a place I would recommend and certainly I'm not coming back,don't waste your time and your money,definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"I've always liked it here.  The portions are fair, and the prices within range for being right off the Strip, in the downtown area.  The soups are quite filling and lush, and well-flavored.  They also have unusual specialties like the nopales (cactus), sautéed. The chips and salsa are plentiful and will make you gain weight overnight.  The atmosphere is somewhat old school, making you feel like you are in your grandmother's parlor...which I like.  Nothing fancy here, but clean and homey."}
{"text":"I bet some of you that know me ask if there's any food place I don't like.  Well here you go, and I'm being generous.  I've been here before with so-so feelings about it but my latest lunch visit made it clear that this wasn't the place for my Mexican butt.

I was here for business purposes so I wasn't really paying too much attention to the menu and just went for the lunch special of two enchilada style tamales, both with pork.  Bad idea, as it seems the sauce just overpowered everything else and they certainly didn't taste like tamales.  The worst part?  The terrible feeling I had in my tummy the rest of the day!  I ended up skipping dinner because of it!  that's right, me Leo, skipping dinner!  That's unheard of!  You know what, just from thinking about it, I'm going to lower my review from two stars to one!"}
{"text":"Was told this is the best Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Well its one of the best I've ever been too. Great prices and huge plates of great food."}
{"text":"I like it here....
Went here with a group of friends ans i ordered the red sauce chiliques, not as flavourful (i prefer the ones at La Poblana) but it was a solid meal. My friends all got either pozole or menudo and all seem happy with it and keep in mind most of us are from Mexico and Peru!
I also LOVE, I mean LOVE the fact that their coffee is Del la Olla!! My favourite! I had 4 cups! 
Service was excellent! We were a big group and were seated pretty fast and our waiter was super nice and accommodating. Even took like 20 pictures for us with everyone's cameras. Not a single order was messed up or wrong. Great Great service. 
Definitely going again when in Vegas. It'll be a permanent go to spot!"}
{"text":"We just came to get drinks and sat at the bar but they served us chips and salsa anyway. The service was excellent and the margs were STRONG. 10/10 would get drunk and eat chips and salsa at again"}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever ate at in my life! $35 for TWO people & the food was complete shit.
I had a cheese tortilla(TCT) & my husband had chicken tamales. 
The TCT was so greasy I could barely eat it & my husbands chicken tamales weren't even cooked. The meat was PINK!!

A car full of ladies were holding us up from getting into our car & when all 6 piled out they asked, \"how was your dinner.\" I replied, \"it was terrible & I would never recommend this place to anyone!\" 5 of them started walking away & one lady kept talking & said one of the ladies that walked away was the OWNER! Not even a I'm sorry your dinner was bad what can we do to make it better....

We came from BOULDER CITY cause I'm 7 months pregnant & was craving Mexican food so we had a date night there.
After reading a lady had a COCKAROACH in her tamale & the chicken wasn't cooked in my husbands, I think this place needs to get reported to the health department so I will gladly be doing so.  just looking at his tamale made me want to THROW UP!"}
{"text":"I stopped at this place because it was on my way to work. I ordered 4 carne Asada tacos. I asked her for a grilled jalapeño and the spiciest salsa they have. She said ok. Did I get either one of them? No. I got the salsa that came with the chips. Smh. The salsa has a funny taste and barely any spice. The tacos don't have a very good taste either. It taste bland like it's missing something. This doesn't taste very authentic to me. I'm hungry as hell and it's still not tasting good to me. I ate one taco and some Spanish rice. The Spanish rice was the best tasting out of it all. They were not busy at all so there was no reason to forget what I asked for. When I walked into the restaurant, they were just standing by the cashier. I was the first to say hi. They didn't even greet me when I walked in. I'm not going back there. You're better off going to Roberto's. This place can't beat Roberto's. Lol"}
{"text":"I love Dona Marias. Best Tamales in town by far. They have great Huevos Ranchero and serve my favorite Mexican beer (Bohemia). The waiters are always friendly and efficient and the old boxing posters are great. I've been coming here for 20 plus years and don't plan on stopping now."}
{"text":"ok so this place has been around for a long time..i would always go as a child. as an adult i will say that i do not go as much. the food isn't too good and the tamales aren't as yummy as before. i ordered some tamales and the bottom part of them were soggy.i don't like tamales that are soggy are i guess uncooked. 
the last time i went i ordered the albondigas (and i only went because my co-worker chose it for her bday lunch). as soon as i got to back to work i ran to the bathroom. i was so sick. i had an upset stomach for two days. sorry dona maria you might have been one of my favorites in the past but now i will only go if forced to."}
{"text":"Had a great time and ate some good food.  Servers had a great sense of humor, and I would recommend to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I came for the signature tamales and left wishing I would have gone to el sombrero.  the food was shlockely prepared and lacked flavor.  it was also lukewarm.  service was equally thoughtless."}
{"text":"My friends and I have made it a habit to come here before we bid farewell to the city of sin! The place is decent but the service is subpar. The waitress was almost bothered that we arrived and we felt extremely rushed when placing our order and through out our dining experience. I can't express enough how terrible service can lead to non repeat visits! No matter how good the food!! At least in my opinion!! Dona Maria you need an attitude adjustment or some classes in customer service!"}
{"text":"Go to a tamale restaurant and not get tamals?  Well, the plan was to try a red and green tamal but that ended when I saw the special for the day - shrimp ceviche tostadas.  There were two to the order.

The citrus used to create the ceviche was excellent.  It was tangy and gave the shrimp a good flavor.  The pieces of shrimp were small in size.  The tostadas came with two lemon sections for extra citrus flavor.  The waiter also brought a bottle of Tapatío without asking.  Great!

Service was very good if not too good.  I was going to get something for dessert but when he noticed I was finished, he brought the bill over and said, \"No hurry.  I'll take that when you're ready.\"  OK!  So I was off to the Mirage for a show and I stopped in my neighborhood for a Baskin-Robbins.  Their loss.

I am going to try the Dona Maria's on Cheyenne nearer home and I will get some tamals."}
{"text":"Menudo and pata was delicious!!!! Michelada was on point!!! Whenever we're in Vegas, we will make it a point to stop by!!!"}
{"text":"My girl to me there a few times, and I had some soup... It had beef in there, it was clear, but it was delicious. Was the best Mexican food I've had."}
{"text":"Unbelievably overrated. This place is way over priced.  $17 for a left over recooked carne asada burrito plate. Located in not so desirable neighborhood. Stay clear!!! The quality of food is sub par.   They are trying to get hotel prices in a ghetto neighborhood. I'm sorry...but I will never return.  They charge $4.25 for microwave tamales.... :("}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat. I had the ceviche tostada and it was by far the best I ever had, so much flavor and perfect for the Nevada heat. The manager was very kind and attentive to anything I asked for. This place had exceptional customer service and Amazzzing food. If your looking to enjoy a great meal and good atmosphere this is the spot!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's a bit over-priced, but there are some pretty good deals on the menu.  I especially like the plates that give you 3 items for about $15.  Their tamales have gone up in price, but they are quite tasty.   The beef burritos are great.  The enchiladas are great.   Their red sauce is spectacular.    I love the salsa they bring with the chips, but I usually got filled up with them before the meal comes which is why I usually split one entree because the plates are large.  A three item plate feeds two.

The worst thing about this place is location.  On two occasions there I have encountered homeless people either sleeping in the parking lot or panhandling.  The place has been there for many years and a high rise condo tower has grown up next door.  The easiest way to get there is while heading south off Las Vegas Blvd., but when you exit take the back street to avoid traffic.  Getting there can be a challenge due to one way streets and heavy traffic on Las Vegas Blvd.  The environment inside is old fashioned kitschy Mexican decor and nothing spectacular.  The layout of the place is atrocious.  You have to walk through the bar to get to the restaurant.  The staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Never Again!!!!!  silverware was dirty, ordered 2 coffees the cups had lipstick.  ordered Cocido and it was luke warm at best.  The food is ok....  the prices are high for what you get.  Will nou return!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot off the strip for a good Mexican food, for breakfast or lunch. I always go here when I'm in town.  It's about a mile north of the Stratosphere, the area can be a bit sketchy but the restaurant is safe and clean.

I recommend the albondigas, they are awesome!  Menudo is good too, and overall everything is very good and very reasonably priced.  

And get a Margarita with your albondigas, so good! The small one is plenty."}
{"text":"We had Dona Maria's cater for a work party, and had their pork, cheese and chicken tamales. The cheese and pork tamales were SO GOOD and made amazing leftovers that night."}
{"text":"Looking for a Mexican Breakfast in Las Vegas? Yeah harder than it looks, this place hit the spot and the tamales were amazing. Try the Queso (Cheese); its so worth the price! Granted it's a bit steep but it's really worth it. To be honest I didn't try lunch/dinner menu but we were looking for a breakfast and we found it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was top notch and the atmosphere was great. Would totally recommend the place and hope to return soon."}
{"text":"I don't know which is worst, my anger or disappointment ..I've heard a lot about the place &decided to give them a try. So I called first thing this morning when the opened and placed a order for a dozen chicken tamales to pick up at 630. I get there at 615 , they charge my card , then come out to tell me they don't have any chicken tamales!!!  Not only did I waste my time but my gas and in case anyone forgot gas is $4 a gallon premium and I live in Henderson! Although the manager was nice I made sure he understood that the reason I placed a order in advance is so I wouldn't have these kind of issues and considering they took down my number when I called, common courtesy or at least any type of professionalism could of been showed by simply calling me! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Went to this place my last time in town. I would say it's a bit of tourist trap with the prices, but the Tamales here are legit. I mean they might seem expensive but wait till you see the size. Much bigger than what I normally see. Yes still expensive but if you can buy 6 or 12 you can carve the per tamale rate down. Not much for the salsa here as it is lacking in about every way possible. Almost seem like tomato sauce at best. Do ask for the green and hot sauces as they are quite a bit better but still nothing to brag about. Most likely I would pass on this place in the future."}
{"text":"I've been going to Vegas for a long time and finally a family friend asked why we've never been here?  That was the first time I had heard of Dona Maria's.. Boy what a great surprise?  Food was delicious.  Now this is definitely a planned stop every time I'm here.  Recently went with friends and it was our first stop.  Food good as always.  Shared a pitcher of Midori margaritas to start the trip off right.  They were good!  This place has not disappointed.. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yes this place always provides great service and fantastic Tamales the rest of the menu is above average what ever you try you will go home happy. Tourist usually when you arrive it is not the same as you get from your home town restaurant you are to used to what you eat at home but this restaurant comes close. I will be back well done"}
{"text":"Doña Maria's is known for their tamales and you can order them individually or by the dozen for take out as well. They serve both the red (beef) and chicken (green) as well as the dessert (pineapple raisin) ones which I was never quite fond of. 

Pozole is similar to Menudo minus the tripe. It is a pork based soup or stew with hominy, chiles, garbanzo beans (traditionally), and other seasonings. Garnishes include cabbage or lettuce (cabbage is better), oregano, radish, cilantro, avocado, and lime juice. Most of the time I come here, I get the Pozole and a tamale or two. Their tacos are good - the avocado being one of my favorites. Their albondigas soup is excellent as well and Melanie tried the Menudo this trip and said it was good."}
{"text":"One night I was craving champurrado & tamales and yelp told me this place had both. This place is known for their tamales and is a very well and long established spot on Las Vegas blvd & Charleston. So I thought i couldn't go wrong going there. The champurrado was okay... they made it out of masa instead of harina and it just didn't taste the way it's supposed to. The tamales were no better than the ones you can buy frozen at your nearest grocery store. Except the chicken & green chili one. Those were good. The prices are good and the service is nice. I watched those servers break a swear by how urgently they were running around to get to everyone. It was nice to see an establishment care like that. The three stars goes to them.... the food, left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Daang Maria, this joint was tabu!  The iced tea was delish, the tortilla soup amazing, and my dish was great. I was pleasantly surprised.
Super small parking spaces, but I can't hold that against them.  
Go, the food was great!  I can't wait to go back, this will be my new Mexican food home."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious and they have great customer service. OMG THE TAMALES, so delicious."}
{"text":"WOW! Great food and service, prices were great and the food was all hot a delicious. I will recommend this place to many others to try as well."}
{"text":"This neighborhood spot is know by locals as an alternative to the overpriced Vegas strip Mexican food that claims to be authentic. The menudo is a friend to any hungover party goer needing a fix from too much tequila or cerveza. They also make a decent Michelada if the menudo doesnt seem to ride you of the pounding headache or embarresment of the night before. If you feel the need for some homemade Mexican food then Dona Maria is the senora you should see."}
{"text":"A new go-to for us as local foodies... The portions are large, prepared wonderfully and with attention to detail, and the presentation is excellent. 

One word \"Amazing!\" Food was awesome! 

I'll be comin here all of the time for some good SoCal tastin Mexican food."}
{"text":"Over priced and he food didn't have flavor. The place was dirty and the bathrooms where 
gross. I would never come back to this place and wouldn't recommend it. If you love Mexican food I would say don't come here because you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic handcrafted tamale this is the place to go.  Being a Mexican American I feel I am somewhat of an expert when it come to these things.  These are just like the one's my mother and grandmother used to make (They have since passed on, but not before handing down these generations old recipes to me and my female family members), the only difference is they did not shred their meat, they made bite size pieces.  I go buy these when I am lazy (because they are labor intensive to make)."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant I always get my food to go but the inside is amazing a mini museum the food is awesome I've been a few times I always get the tamale dinner I have to try something new next time I'm there staff is friendly as well"}
{"text":"Ah, Dona Maria, I have had you bookmarked for so long...

My co-worker brought me here during lunch to celebrate my birthday. This simple Mexican place in Downtown Las Vegas is \"OK\".

We started with fresh, tasty, and warm chips. Came with a nice, tomato-y salsa. We also ordered the guacamole, which was good.

I decided to go with the combo plate that was 1 enchilada and 1 tamal. I got a chicken enchilada (shredded, decent, nothing great), and a pork tamal. The pork was not impressive, however the tamal itself, the corn masa specifically, was quite good - this is what to get when you come here, after all, it IS in the name of the restaurant.

Service was fine. It was not busy during lunch time and everything was clean. 

Come for the tamales, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"First time Yelp let us down, been yelping on vacations for years. Did not try the Tamales. Had Enchiladas and Chiliaquias. I'm guessing the sauce came out of a can, salty, bad Taste and YULK. Can't get the bad taste out of my mouth Service was average, no complaints but the place was empty. Prices were a little high for the quality. Back to the Strip for expensive but excellent food."}
{"text":"I found myself here for my friends wedding reception. There is plenty of parking, we didn't get to order what we wanted but the selection they had was a really good choice, chicken tamales- they were soft and tasty 4/5, beef enchiladas- good mole 4/5, beans and rice both good 4/5, that is all I ate. Oh and margaritas!!!!! 4/5 as well. I really feel the food was good but the reason for me to go back would be because of the staff they were really nice and attentive anything we needed they were right there.  They talked with us a little bit in between filling our glasses and taking away plates. I really appreciate when staff is friendly. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll swing by for a quick meal"}
{"text":"I ordered tamales to go, half beef and half chicken. Both were absolutely delicious. They were juicy and filled, and I do mean filled with meat!  The chicken w/green chili were my favorite, I have never had any like these...phenomenal! 
I will definitely be returning on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Best tamales!! Delicious food! Had the caldo de camaron and it tasted just like my own. Most places don't put veggies but this place does plus avocado which is rare due to the host cost. Only downfall was the wait time for the food and the place was understaffed therefore, not very attentive with drinks, chips, or other necessities."}
{"text":"OMG we just ate here for lunch and were blown away by how good everything was! I usually get enchiladas when I go out for Mexican food and these were the best I've ever had.. Super moist, juicy chicken, amazing sauce, and melty cheese all over. Husband got a beef burrito which was super moist and juicy too. Rice and beans were great. Chips and salsa were perfect- warm crispy chips and just spicy enough salsa. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What can I say. It is truly the best Mexican restaurant. I love eating here. My family and I have been coming in for years. 
The servers are always so friendly, never see a grumpy face. They come around often for any of your needs. 
The food is just so amazing. Delicious. It literally melts in your mouth. Meats are tender, juicy. I had the enchilada and Chile relleno plate, (Dang) it was really really good. Served with salsa verde, which had a slight spiciness to it. 
I ordered a Margarita, the Mango flavor. It was delicious. They serve them however you like your drink.
My husband ordered a beer (Modelo) which was served super cold.
We had such a great time. I love the decor. The authentic feel to it. It's full of life and there is no need for loud blasting music or disco lights or even low lighting  to enjoy the food and your family and friends here. 
If there were  more stars I'd give them more
Thank you to all who make this restaurant great."}
{"text":"Live the authentic food, the coffee is great, and my food is ALWAYS hot! Im very picky and this is s place even I don't have to worry.
 Salsa is killer, tamales legendary, and Horchata fresh.
 What's not to live?"}
{"text":"Came for lunch today and it was pretty terrible! First off it felt like there focus here is getting food out quickly probably because the court house and other businesses nearby so they gotta get out quickly for lunch. My boyfriend ordered the carnitas tostadas and he was not happy with them at all. Overloaded with lettuce and they were pretty soggy. He actually folded the tostada in half like a taco so that tells u how soggy they were. I had a 3 item plate with a taco, tamale, and enchilada. It was alright nothing special. The tamale was ok and they use store bought taco shells for there tacos. This place could be great but it seems like there food is just thrown on a plate ."}
{"text":"My mother told me about this place. Said she used to eat here in the 80's and it was delicious. I love knowing that a place has been open for decades. I love the taste of history. Tamales are my all time favorite and I only like getting them from little Mexican woman that make them in their own home. 

This place is in a busy area. I always see the sign but the building is in a parking lot facing another building. So you really can't see it from the outside and was so hungry I don't even remember what it looked like out side. 

When we first walked in there was a bar that could seat maybe ten across and a beautiful  bartender who greeted and seated us the moment we walked in. Less than a minute later we had hot chips and salsa and had a waiter asking what we would like to drink. 

We already knew we were there for tamales. I loved that there menu had every Mexican food item you could think of with tamale. It's perfect for people that just wanna try it or wanna a little of both. We ordered chicken, pork, cheese, and desert tamale. With a side of rice and beans of course. 

While waiting for our tamales we adored the restaurant. It has pictures of Mexican families on the walls. The entire place felt very homey and family oriented. Even the little chip basket was cute. 

When the tamales arrived my eyes lit up. They looked delicious and they were. Hot and fresh. The cheese tamales were my favorite. The flavor of fresh cheese, corn, and tomato made a perfect combination. I was just as happy with the chicken. It was very juicy and a nice flavor. 

As much as I love meaty tamales the sweet ones are my favorite. I have had sweet corn and pineapple tamales. But never raisin pineapple. I was very excited. So excited I made sure I ordered two for myself incase I loved it. And I did. It was such a sweet flavor with the perfect amount of spice. They are not like other sweet tamales that are simply sweet, they have a hint of spice that makes you keep wanting more. Serious love. 

Great experience!! Great food!! Great service!! Perfect place to bring friends for great food at a great price!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we will be back! Very flavorful food. I had the huevos con chili verde, husband had Chillaquiles.   Chips and salsa are excellent as well. Can't wait to come back and try the enchilada style tamale."}
{"text":"I like this family run Mexican restaurant. It's not too far from the famous gold & silver pawn shop. I like their home made chips, their salsa sauce and taco."}
{"text":"We had a nice tasting lunch, but it was marred by the bus boy slamming dishes into the boxes outside the kitchen door. The noise was loud, startling, and jarring. Even after I asked him to work more quietly, he continued. It disrupted conversation. We waited in vain for the waitress to pick up the check (delivered without any inquiry about dessert or coffee).  We finally took it up to the cashier ourselves. This was no way to treat customers whose bill was over $100. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I only gave it 2 stars because of the service the waiters where on it but other than that, man where can I begin...Let's begins with the salsa, the salsa tastes like spicy tomato paste or spicy ketchup if the Salsa ain't good than the food ain't good that's a fact for authentic Mexican food.Second I ordered a #14 tamal,enchilada,and burrito with rice and can beans jaja the tamale was cold no flavor what's so ever meat no flavor, enchilada more tomato paste for the sauce,burrito ah whatever and expensive as well this all came out to be $24 with a soda and some change not including tip worst of it all I was sick the whole day I was burping it and cold sweat I didn't know if I should shit or throw up first I was shitting like a pigeon all night couldn't sleep at night I was tossing and turning everyone in the room gather around me like if I was having an exorcism it was scary...the only authentic thing about that place is the name and only good thing there was the chips that they give you from the bag.someone needs to handle Doña Maria a new Recipe book"}
{"text":"The customer service was horrible, hostess completely ignore my family . Waiter rude , horrible food . Very bad experience . Over all the food was dry and over cooked and at the end the over all experience was bad. I tried to give them a chance and not get up and walk out . I regret not walking out ,it was just not good .    At all"}
{"text":"Food was good and authentic. Very pricey. A little disappointed in the Tamales (which is what they are known for) I ordered a cheese tamale. It was a lot smaller than expected especially for the price."}
{"text":"Yum. The enchilada-style tamales are oh so tasty. Probably some of the best red enchilada sauce I have ever had. Carne asada was fairly generic, though. 

The tamales with red enchilada sauce, a pitcher or margaritas (not wimpy and very tasty!!), and sopapillas are completely decadent and a good way to cut a long night short. :-)"}
{"text":"After a night out we decided to stop here the next morning. After being seated, they took forever to taking our orders. Me and my husband both ordered menudo. My husband found a hair in his. We both ordered micheladas and they were not good. They had no flavor at all. We went with 3 of our friends. One of them ordered a side of sour cream. When we were all paying he noticed they had charged him for the side of sour cream he asked and the waitress said it was charged cause it was the large side of sour cream. In no moment did she ever said it was going to be extra or even gave him the option of a small side or large side of sour cream. They need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on their tamales! I haven't actually visited the restaurant, but their tamales speak loudly. My fiance's parents choose this Dona Maria location for our Christmas Day tradition, so I've had them at least once a year for the last few years. They are good. Really good. They prefer the pork with red sauce, so I haven't had the opportunity to try the chicken with spicy green sauce or other variations. The masa is moist and delicious. The pork is succulent and flavorful with the great red sauce. Most importantly, the tamale is HUGE and there is no shortage of filling! It really is the winning combination for the best tamales.

I would highly recommend ordering a dozen for $19.25 (or $1.60/each) rather than paying $3.95 for one. They also offer an order of half a dozen for $14.25 ($2.38/each) which is still a better deal. Call ahead to place your order and it comes double-bagged for easy storage (freeze some for later!)."}
{"text":"Great tamales but hate the fact I cannot order a dozen tamales off your postmates page now. That's the only thing we order from here for a family of four and I hate going downtown. Won't be ordering from here as much now"}
{"text":"Soooo good. The perfect family owned Mexican restaurant. Great food and great service. The tamales were amazing"}
{"text":"Awesome place! If you enjoy Mexican flavor this place can't be beat. I recommend the Menudo for breakfast. And if that was enough... the people are fantastico! This place is a must whenever we visit Las Vegas. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food. I had the Shrimp Soup and it was excellent. My husband loved the chicken tacos. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Used to be good 2 years ago.  The albondigas soup was okay, but everything else was at best so-so.  Unfortunately, all four of us got sick after eating here.  Clearly the place has gone downhill.  You have been warned.  The server was a nice guy, about the only saving grace."}
{"text":"I am on the fence about this place.  It has good customer service.  Cute old school decor and location.  The variety of the menu is good as well.  I also like that it is not touristy.

I am 50/50 with the food.  I had the mole enchiladas and the hubby the enchilada style tamale.  The food was good, not great!  The mole was not thin and watery but for my plate being enchiladas de mole it needed a lot more mole on it.  The chicken inside with not a lot of mole sauce made it pretty dry.

I took my leftovers home, but didn't eat them because it just wasn't half as good later like some food is.

I honestly can't say if I will go back.  If we are in the area and need a quick meal; maybe."}
{"text":"Every year I participate in the Komen Cancer Walk in Las Vegas and this year our team treated ourselves to Dona Maria's.  This was the first time I have been here since I am not a local but I am sure I will be coming back.  The tamales were good of course!  And the menudo was great! It can be hard sometimes to find a good tasting and clean menudo.  The only draw back was that they restaurant didnt seem prepared for large parties."}
{"text":"I have been going to Dona Maria's for such a long time. I had to stop a few years ago while I was pregnant with my son because I had friggin nose like a bloodhound and could smell EVERYTHING when I walked in. No matter where I sat, it smelled like someone shat on the coats, or at least in the vicinity of the coats. So...needless to say, a toilet smell makes me not want to eat. I do have to point out that it was the pregnancy elevating my senses, but whatever. We came back last week and were very disappointed. The prices were increased from last time, and my favorite soup was changed. They put friggin garbanzos in the veg soup. C'mon man. I do want to share this little disgusting tidbit with you though:

Upon ordering the soup, you get a condiment tray. It is a three tiered holder with cilantro at the top, lemon slices, and chili flakes at the bottom. I accepted it and used it like it was my own, especially for me. The waiter came to the table and asked if I was done with it. I said yes because he could clearly see that we were done eating. OMG. He took my tray....and placed it at another table. What the hell? I had used my fingers to grab the cilantro out. If I had known that the tray was communal, I wouldn't have even touched it. My face just dropped and I felt some food coming back up so we paid our tab and left with a bad taste in our mouths. Whatevs. I'm over that place."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here to eat after coming to Vegas from out of town.. The food wasn't bad at all! Nor the service! Usually I'm the kind of guy that like to chat with the waiters and waitresses a bit but I just felt like these guys just weren't in the mood to chat. I'm not sure if they were kinda ticked off because Mexico lost in the FIFA tournament (given it's a Mexican restaurant) or what but I wish I wasn't treated like cattle to get me in and out of there.. Would I eat here again? Of course! The food was excellent! I enjoyed the combination plates they offered. It was the perfect meal and the prices were very reasonable! Although I paid 12 bucks for a margarita :( but no doubt, I would suggest this place for a quick and easy meal!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to come if your in the strip and craving them tamales!! (Chicken with green salsa are my fav :D). Of all those 11 years I've been there, the chips are always warm.(their chips are soo addicting !!). The staff are very friendly and are gladly available for your assist. If you you still have room for dessert don't hesitate to order their epic fried ice cream( my grandmother can't get of that sh!t lol).This restaurant can also be a really good place to hold a reservation or party. Ohhhh and there's FREE WIFI!!Overall, tamales doña Maria is a great place to take the family out for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This part of downtown Las Vegas has seen better times. Do not judge this wonderful Mexican restaurant by the area. The tamales are out of this world. Best ever. The special was two  tamales, I ordered the chicken, with soup or salad, refried beans and Spanish rice. The portions were very large to say the least. Price was a very reasonable $12.95. While this restaurant is about a 30 minute drive for me I would go there anytime I desired a quality experience."}
{"text":"Terrible food and incredibly overpriced! The salsa tasted like plain tomato sauce. The chips tasted like stale oil. I had a two taco \"lunch special\" with shredded beef....inedible! The \"beef\" was drowned in sauce to where it felt like I was having soup in a shell. AND My \"lunch special\" cost $32 for two people (the other person in my group had a chicken salad). I won't be going back! It's too bad because us folks who work downtown are always looking for a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Not in the best of areas, I wouldn't venture to this direction late at night.  Fortunately, we got up early Sunday and went for breakfast.  Nice decor and nice sizeable dining area, just past the bar upon entry.  We were seated near the kitchen/bussing area, which bothered the Mrs. Furniture could use an upgrade as the tables and chairs looked older. But I loved the Mexican decor and the place looked clean.

We went for the number one combo, two tamales, rice & beans.  Beans were very good, rice was moist (just the way I like it). Service was friendly, though we felt rushed by the older male waiter. Tamales were good but too much masa and cheese and not enough green chiles.  My wife didn't like the sweet tamales.  She did, however, like that they did not forget her to-go order, as some places do.  Points for that.  Also points for the delicioso salsa.

Another thing we liked was that they seemed to work as a team. We had three different people serve us, they didn't have separate stations and each server is on his/her own.

Negatives: $4.30 for a side of beans, $4.30 for a side of rice, $4+ for a tamale a la carte.  These same items are two-fifty in L.A.  I understand this is Vegas, but in this part of town?

So after my meal I had to make a little trip to the little boys' room.  Wouldn't you know, no toilet paper.  Who doesn't check and fill the paper roll before they open?  It was one of those rolls that has 10 feet of paper on it and I find the only one in Las Vegas that is out, at breakfast!!!   Fortunately, I checked before I did my business and improvised (I will not elaborate). I did let them know and they were polite about replacing it.

Not bad, but not a place I will go running back to."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic Mexican restaurant, but it loses points for being in one of the worst parts of Vegas.

My parents have been bringing me to this restaurant since I was a baby, even back when they were in their old location on Charleston. As anyone who reads my reviews knows, I am not a huge Mexican food fan, but this place has amazing food. From chips and salsa right down to entrees that consist of a little bit of everything Mexican, I don't think I have ever eaten a bad meal here. It's difficult to recommend a particular item, but I doubt any fan of Mexican food will be disappointed.

The staff are also extremely friendly and courteous. Having gone here for years, my family is often recognized when we pay the place a visit. These are great folks, and they definitely treat their customers like family.

The atmosphere is average, though it does get a bit annoying when soccer games are going on on the TV, and people start cheering loudly. Also, for no apparent reason, there are tons of posters for old Las Vegas boxing matches on the wall. Not complaining or anything, I just thought it was a bit strange. 

The only thing that keeps me from giving this place a higher score is its location - the run-down, old end of the Strip. If you've ever watched Pawn Stars, this place is kitty corner from the pawn shop. There are always seedy characters down here, and it's common to have the homeless begging you for money. It's too bad the owners here can't borrow Antoine from the Pawn Shop to clear out the riff-raff that often fills the parking lot.

Still, despite its not-so-great location, Dona Maria's has some of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. Come for the food, but do yourself a favor and come armed."}
{"text":"The tamales are excellent, and the Horchata flows with lots of flavor. The chips and salsa took one reminder, then they stayed full.
 I love the coffee, a hint of cinnamon, tastes like Cancun coffee. It stays full, no matter how busy they get. I have never seen a wait, though the parking lot gets full.
 The area is sketchy, lock your car doors. However we have never had a problem. The traffic leaving is ok if you realize there is a rear exit. Otherwise plan on patience. The rear exit is a ONE WAY street, be careful.
 We used to go here weekly with my Grampa, it was bittersweet when they remembered us. He loved breakfasts, and started the Sunday morning tradition. Every family needs one, or you start to break apart. So, why not have Huevoes Rancheroes here, they are sublime. (I use that word when I want to feel pretentious. Heh)
 They have tamales to go, even dessert ones, sales people, heads up. Something different than donuts on those sales calls!"}
{"text":"Great service. We only had dessert. The fried ice cream was wonderful.  All the servers were friendly. All the meals going by looked delicious. A definite place to try for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Menudo was on point! Great service and the price is great. I definitely would recommend coming to this authentic Mexican food. 

My wife had chorizo eggs and beans and that dish was great as well."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I have ever had! Great price, friendly service and clean!  I highly recommend. They also serve breakfast 24 hrs super cheap , like 5 bucks, thats crazy ! The tortillas hand made, the refried beans , just WOW! We loved it so much that we didn't have a microwave and improvised to warm it up.. Go and check it out!"}
{"text":"Being from Texas we were desperately needing a fix of mexican food.  So we reviewed Yelp and found this place.  We decided to give it a try.. The food was good with great favor.  They had a very friendly staff.  I considered the plates to be over priced but we were in Vegas so I guess that's excusable.  But I have never heard of $16 a doz.  Tamales but they were huge."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Las Vegas, I go to Dona Maria's.  The food is fantastic.  My took a good friend of mine to have breakfast.  Great great great.  The food was fantastic.  I wish I could eat more.  My only complaint is that the service is a little slow.  However, I will still give them 5 stars.  I will always come back and highly recommend them."}
{"text":"These tamales are amazing!!! But get there early, we went 2 days in a row. On the first day our tamales were amazing and the service was fantastic (because we got there early for breakfast.). On the second day the tamales weren't as great but still so so good! And the service was a little lacking but they were busy so it's all good. They freshly blend the colada drinks so it's just fresh and yummy!! By the way I recommend the chicken tamales, they are by far the best of the bunch! Prices are good, staff were nice, and the restaurant itself is like a really great hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I order the chicken tacos lunch special- pulled a few partial gizzards out of my taco before giving up on the meal all together."}
{"text":"Ripped off on Tax Day! As loyal customers, we received an email offering $10.40 off on a minimum purchase of $25 today. Nowhere on the email did it say it had to be printed and brought in, and there was no coupon attached. We assume all customers would get the discount. Even though we called up the email on the phone and displayed it, they refused to honor it because it wasn't printed. Restaurants that use Social Media and email to promote should be able to honor an email offer displayed on the phone, especially when they didn't say it had to be printed! Food and service were fine, but very disappointed with the way they handled loyal customers today!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try!!! I've been coming here for years!!! The food is great, salsa is amazing and the michladas are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! We went looking for good breakfast sort of outside of the chaos of Vegas and we found this place! We are from San Diego so we LOVE our mexican food. This place delievered; great bloody Mary's and awesome huevos rancheros!"}
{"text":"Delish....highly recommend coffee the tameles ....service was great...we always come when we come to vegas"}
{"text":"Probably the best tamales I've had in Las Vegas. I always get the 2 cheese tamales enchilada style. This meal comes with beans and rice along with their chips and salsa. Chips are good, not a fan of the salsa -- it's more of a tomato paste. Overall it's delicious and I would defiantly go back."}
{"text":"best tamales on earth hands down!!! the service was amazing as well! highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident while In Vegas for my bday.  We both loved it!  The menudo was prolly the best my wife & I have ever had & the Machaca was excellent!  Seems mostly like a locals only place with a very good atmosphere & service in the bar area where we sat.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in Sin City."}
{"text":"Very good food! Chips n salsa as soon as we sat, servers were very courteous and on it when it came to our needs. Food was delicious. Parking is large.. only thing I didn't like was when we walked in a couple staff members passed us without acknowledging us, had never been there but I did read a sign that said wait yo be seated so we stood there for couple mins..  otherwise pleasant experience. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Very tasty. We're never disappointed when we go here. The tamales are delicious and the margaritas are strong. The service can be slow so be sure to ask for what you need when the server is at the table. The downtown location is obviously not in a great area but they make up for their shortcomings with flavor and portions. You could easily share a plate with someone and have plenty."}
{"text":"Salsa had hair in it, yuck! This was not worthy to be called Mexican food, the only good thing was the coffee, it had an authentic taste. I would never recommend this place to anyone. My take is that this place is not authentic and caters to tourists who think they are going somewhere with quality Mexican food....not! Plus, the prices are over priced, it's ridiculous they would charge $4.50 for a single tamale, the most generic at that! I was totally blown away with their high prices and poor quality food."}
{"text":"Very delicious little Mexican food spot. Plates have more than enough food. So far we love everything."}
{"text":"Good design as we walked in. We waited like 25-30 min for our food. But the waiter Jose was so kind& chatty with us that we didn't mind to much. (: we had 13 people. Everyone liked their food. I would definitely return if I lived in the area. Great place (:"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch specials and fun atmosphere inside for co-workers and friends to meet for lunch. (I say inside due to a hooker or drug fight outside upon our arrival. Shady area near downtown VEGAS) Only downside was having to wait a while to pay at the  cashier because there was no one there. Not a huge deal though. The friendly service and appetizing mexican cuisine was great. Will go back."}
{"text":"After being downtown twice in the past week, and eating here both times it occurs to me I've never reviewed Dona Maria's Tamales. Kind of hard to believe, seeing as how I've been eating at both locations for almost as long as I've been in Las Vegas... since like 2001. Food is always consistently good. They have awesome Pork Tamales, delicious Albondigas. Chips are fried fresh and hot, salsa is good although I prefer salsa with chopped tomato, onion and cilantro versus their tomato-ey blended salsa. I think they have one of the best chile rellenos around, although holy crap it was spicy as hell last time! (Dona's - remember to clean out the seeds, Yo!) really good enchiladas and so far pretty much every time I eat here it's consistently good. It's one of my three favorite Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I have always loved this restaurant. Its a classic in Las Vegas. Located downtown on Las Vegas Blvd and Charleston.

They are well known for their tamales! Order in advance for all your party needs!

I have had so many of their entrees over the years. Today I had the Chorizo taco and Avocado taco, each were $4 and very tasty! My guest had the Chicken fajitas with melted cheese on top(must request), and he loved them. The condiments and side chips are very good, but we didn't eat much of them as we were too full.

Great customer service and nice atmosphere if you like old Vegas style dining. 

Always a Fan and a repeat customer. Highly recommend if you are in the downtown area or just looking for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Um yeah, so I've worked in restaurants my entire working life and tonight I've witnessed a few fundamental health code violations. Our water was poured from the tap straight from a hand sink in the back into our glasses.  The hand soap from said sink was located directly over a pitcher of iced tea and a pitcher of water. The server washed out a horchata/lemonade pitcher in that very same sink--which you're not supposed to do. Those sinks are for hand washing only. I saw a busser bus tables then go cook on the line. Did he wash his hands or just wipe them on his extremely dirty apron. Seriously it looked like he was butchering meat. Unfortunately we were seated near the line where the servers pick up the food. They were horsing and joking around to the point we thought they had been drinking. It was really inappropriate. In keeping with the drunk theme, my server literally laughed at me when I ordered a cheese tamale. He apologized, maybe he was thinking of something else but it was really rude. On a positive note, the food didn't suck.  I actually wouldn't mind food poisoning; I could really stand to  lose a pound or two. Hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Definitely nice that they had Wi-Fi here for their customers also lots of interesting pictures of old boxers grace the wall here. Great place for old school boxing fans who love Las Vegas flights to come and have a nice lunch or dinner. Next time I would like to try their tamales reason I gave them a three is because when my soup was brought out it was all over the place and not in the bowl :-/ (it would've been nice if they wiped it first!)"}
{"text":"Overall, we gave this place a thumbs up (7 in our group).  The tamales are large with a lot of meat ... we had pork, chicken, and beef, they were all good.  I can't tell you how many tamales I've had that were WAY to much masa for the amount of meat, these are not that.  Basically, they do taste like homemade, not like some uber-modern eatery that's doing all these things to them.  Service was good (not great), ambiance was good, etc.  Really liked the fact that you can order tamales a la carte, didn't want to fill up on rice and beans which are usually very mediocre.  Here's the deal with pricing ... if you order singles, they are $4.50 each (ouch).  If you order a half dozen, they are $3.00 each and for a full dozen, $2.00 each.  Since we had a large group, we ordered 18.  So if you can order more (to eat there or take home), you will save a LOT.

I don't understand a lot of the other reviews.  I lived 50 years in CA (Orange County, Bay Area, San Diego County) and RARELY found a good tamale there.  First, don't complain about salt.  A lot of people don't want or can't eat salt, so put your own f*cking salt on.  And the same goes for hot sauce.  A number of people in our group ordered very spicy hot sauce and put their own on, each to there own.  I don't like mine spicy.

Btw, the men's room didn't have any paper towels."}
{"text":"Very good tamales. Very large, beautifully appointed building. That said, you will get better atmosphere, service, and, not surprisingly, better tamales in the parking lot of el Super."}
{"text":"Dona Maria's came highly recommended from Frommer's Las Vegas guide so my friends and I decided to head there for dinner before going to Talk of the Town which is within walking distance.

The restaurant itself is great.  Hearing the tamales were awesome I ordered a basket of 6 for myself (the price was very reasonable), while my friends picked dishes off the menu.  I quickly realized that ordering 6 tamales was a mistake as I was full and satisfied after 2.  Tamales I've had in the past have almost always been short on filling and disappointing- not these.  They are almost entirely filling and are excellent.  My friends were both satisfied with their menu dishes saying they were quite good.  The service kept us happy by refilling our chips and salsa very quickly throughout.

Typically Mexican food will destroy my intestines, and as I was going to a strip club right after I was somewhat nervous about eating here first.  Luckily I had no stomach problems- a true Vegas miracle and testament to how fresh and well prepared Dona Maria's food really is.

Dona Maria's is located north of the Stratosphere on Las Vegas Blvd.  I'd suggest taking a cab there and back since the area is kind of shady and the walk from here to the Stratosphere is deceptively long."}
{"text":"not good, not particularly bad either. the chips and salsa are pretty much the best part of the meal. The fideo soup is also OK. The tamales are actually decent although not mind blowing as several reviews have mentioned. The chicken soup is also OK, full of vegetables with a side of tortillas, enough for a complete meal. 

One thing I hate is the cooker's addiction to the microwave. Ever wonder why the plates are super hot when served? All cheese is grilled with the micro, which really sucks as it burns and dries the food. It also gives the impression that is not fresh. To be fair, the problem is common in most (if not all) the mexican food restaurant I've been in Vegas.

The place is OK for an office meal. Not for a family feast.  

I hate that every time I go the TV is tuned to soap operas. I mean, can we watch the news or at least NFL network???

Overall, average restaurant. The staff is very friendly, thou.

UPDATE: went for lunch today. Boy, I could hear the microwave all over the place. Please stop!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated  about they have the best tamales , I brought dozen of them and they were very dry ! But their chicken soup was good ! Oh well I tried !"}
{"text":"This was our first visit upon the recommendation of a friend. We did takeout and got a dozen tamales and they were great!  The restaurant is large and looks inviting and we may have to return for dinner. 

But those tamales are a five!"}
{"text":"We dropped by for a quick drink and they made us the best margarita of my life . The staff was really friendly and not pushy. Even though it wasn't a weekend, the place was pretty crowded and everybody seemed to be having a good time. Next time I want to come back for a their food, in sure it's very good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Menudo in Vegas. Service was awesome! Nice atmosphere, Definitely coming back"}
