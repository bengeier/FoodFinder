{"text":"If I could give 0 star, I would've. The place is small. cosy and pretty... and that's pretty much it. The manager, Mona is just horrible pretty much as horrible as the food they serve there and the \"karaoke\" experience they advertise. Drinks were okay.  But the whole menu is overpriced.  We booked the place for an evening birthday party. Mona requested a 100$ deposit, to make sure we will show up which I can understand. However she claimed that we didn't drink enough and waisted her time that night, which apparently gave her the right to hold onto our deposit. On top of asking us to leave and hour prior the agreed time and giving us attitude that evening. The 2 other staff members were very nice. I would never set a foot in that place again, nor my friends.  This comment will probably be deleted, since it seems to be a common practic from this place.  Run away from Carlaw Bistro"}
{"text":"They honestly have the BEST SOUP I have ever tasted. If you haven't been in for lunch, I suggest you do so. Great Martinis and cheese board for late night also"}
{"text":"I ended up at Blackout Cafe and Lounge while waiting for an appointment in the area.   Given the sign says \"cafe\" and lounge I thought this would be a good option for a cappuccino to kill some time. I was greeted at the door by very friendly staff and welcomed to take a seat anywhere.  I'd describe the decor and vibe as more lounge than cafe. It's full of low seating, loud top 40 music, and a well stocked bar. It does have TVs and is showing World Cup games right now.   The cappuccino I had was served very hot and came with a store bought cookie and water. The cappuccino was lack lustre. Not bad, but not great and at $4.50 I felt I was paying for the cookie I wasn't eating. There's definitely better places to visit within walking distance.   When I came in I did see daily drink specials and a food menu so this might be a better option for after work drinks than an afternoon cafe."}
{"text":"I can't believe how much I love this place. It has a very euro vibe and really fills a niche that Toronto has been missing. The staff are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. The drink list is fancy yet very affordable. This has become my go-to spot for a classy, fun night on the town."}

{"text":"It may have taken a while for the place to find it's identity and maybe it's still figuring it out.  I can however say that the staff is great and super friendly.  They have started making soups that change daily and they are amazing.  Sandwiches are also really good.  If you're in the area it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time visiting Carlaw Bistro and it certainly won't be my last! This cute bistro caught my eye when I was in the area, and I decided to give it a shot. (They had a sign that said Come Try Our Cookie Balls! so that was a good start). The place is very well decorated and also very inviting. There were two of us and we ordered the soup, salad, coffee and cookie combo for $15 and the soup, sandwich, coffee and cookie combo for $15 and both were great choices! Cauliflower soup was flavourful and came with toast (I would get it again if it's the daily soup!) and the grilled chicken sandwich and tuna salad were both tasty and fresh! Coffee was great and the cookies too! I didn't get any alcoholic beverages, but they had a full bar and a great menu!  Another awesome addition to this place is that they have a variety of board games to play while you are there! We ended up spending a good amount of time here over a competitive game of Battleship and then Connect 4.  The staff were very attentive and friendly, a really warm environment!  I would definitely recommend this place if you are over in the east end of the city and I will definitely go back again!"}
