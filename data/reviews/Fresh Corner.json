{"text":"The guy making sandwiches, getting wraps, making salads was kicking butt.  Fantastic sense of purpose and urgency!  I tried a chicken and provolone wrap.  While the flavor was ok, the thing was simply too small.  Like pitifully small. Maybe two slices of meat, and a single slice of cheese. The wrap might have been 5.5\" long.  There's just nothing redeeming about this wrap whatsoever.  Take your same $7.00 over to My Big Fat Greek Gyro closeby in Market Square, and get a serious lunch.  I was trying to be healthy, but it's pretty hard if we're going to call this a meal.  I was going to rank three stars, but definitely down voting due to poor value."}
{"text":"Best wrap I ever had! Bread and chicken is made fresh daily. The price matches the quality of the food. The guy who makes the wraps and sandwiches is quick and on point!"}
{"text":"Good fresh salad. Service is not very enthusiastic but what can you expect at a food court"}
{"text":"A rude worker messed with the wrong customer! I Yelp horrible experiences, honestly. He put one slice each turkey and roast beef, ONE SLICE (less than a slice actually). THE MEAT BARELY COVER MY BREAD!!!  I came back to say maybe add more meat and he started rudely overloading the sandwich with everything that I already bit into- and with HAM ? I didn't ask for HAM! I asked for turkey and roast beef! This place puts boars head meat to SHAME!   Their portions of meat are not enough to make the sandwich worth it for 8 bucks!!! .  I WILL NOT RETURN. this place is a JOKE!"}
{"text":"It's fine. expensive, but you get to create your own salad."}
