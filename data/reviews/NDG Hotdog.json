{"text":"Poutine is super good, as well as the gyros. Used to go there often when I had classes at Loyola!"}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation in Montreal craving poutine and saw this restaurant in the neighborhood I was staying at. The poutine was amazing and so was the hamburger I ordered. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and great service."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time to get snacks for the family. Great little hotdog/hamburger place that also makes submarines, souvlaki, Greek salad, poutine, etc. They are sports fans so you can sit down and eat your lunch while watching the game on tv. Nice little patio outside. Good fast food (amazing fries), nice casual ambience, friendly people working there."}
{"text":"I go here when I have classes at the Loyola campus. There really aren't that many options around and this place is really nice. The staff is really friendly. Nice variety of food for fair prices. If it's between gross cafeteria food and this, pick this."}
{"text":"I think this is a new go to place for me! They have super good fries, and have a selection of burgers, hot dogs, panini, and poutine. They even have veggie burgers, which is what I had, and it was really good! Staff are friendly and service was pretty good, a bit slow but nothing unreasonable. Nice building, only complaint is that it isn't wheel chair accessible because there's a big step up at the end of the ramp."}
{"text":"NDG Hotdog is a five minute walk from Concordia, located at 7363 Sherbrooke Street Ouest.  I have gone here several times and it never disappoints.  They serve hot-dogs (steamed, toasted and michigan), burgers (cheeseburger, doubles, and michigan), philly steak or italian sausage paninis, poutines (chicken, bacon, italian and regular), pogos, gyros, chicken pitas, salad (Chef, Grilled chicken and Greek) and soup of the day.  I absolutely love the philly cheese steak panini and their burgers and hot-dogs are delicious.  I tried the chicken pita for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I was pleasantly surprised.  They always use fresh ingredients and you can tell as soon as you take the first bite.  The majority of the people who have gone here love the poutine as well.  *Update*  I just tried the italian poutine and oh my goodness- SO good.  If you can't decide whether or not you want pasta or a poutine, this is a must try!*  You can also get anything as part of a combo and the prices are amazing.  I have always seen the same three men as the staff and they are all very friendly and polite.  I can always expect fast and great service.  You can sit inside and watch hockey and other sports on the television, or you can enjoy the Montreal summer weather on their terrace.  It is a great place to get a quick bite to eat, especially if you are a Concordia student.  I would recommend trying this restaurant out at least once- even if it's just to have a \"cheat day\" diet wise.  For more reviews, check out my Yelp page and visit the blog listed!"}
{"text":"NDG Hotdog opened up in the summer of 2014 in the space left behind by \"new Moon Pizza\". I consider this a major upgrade! The ower is a very nice guy and the cook is also friendly and funny.   Hot dogs on par with the usual places like Belle Province and the Pountine is exactly the way it should be - crispy fries and piping hit gravy that melts the cheese curds - Yum!  NDG Hotdog also offers some yero pitas, and some other items that I haven't had a chance to sample yet. The #3 (hotdog & Poutine) is my \"go to\" order.   NDG Hotdog is a great and needed addition to the border between NDG and Montreal West."}
