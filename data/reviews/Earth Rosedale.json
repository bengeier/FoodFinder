{"text":"Service was excellent, food presentation was beautiful. Pig bits plate was tiny but interesting and oysters were fresh but w/out much flavor maybe due to being raised in fresh and sea waters both. The sweet potato soup special w sheep's milk yogurt was a little under seasoned as was the beet salad. Rainbow trout was good and the one filet was cut into 2 half pieces instead of the usual presentation of the whole fish. The chocolate cake w bottom crust of chocolate nibs is not to be missed even if the popcorn panna cotta sounds more interesting."}
{"text":"We went in for a mid-week dinner after purchasing groupon deal. We were impressed by the chic modern decor. We got seated near the open kitchen, the chefs were quite animated. The waiters were attentive and pleasant.  We got smoked pork croquettes to start. What a delicious appetizer, deep fried goodness. Felt fairly full after three of these on a bed of greens. For mains, I shared steelhead trout on a bed on pur√©e with apricots and pork charcuterie. Overall, the portions were generous, the latter dish was meat overload. My husband and I had a taste of all the prepared meats, with half the dish remaining.  For dessert, i had the sticky toffee pudding over a flavourful dates cake. The milk chocolate pudding was a nice compliment to a small cappuccino.  Overall, a very nice meal with excellent service. Definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the only one available at last minute notice on St Patrick's Day, and I can see why.  The ambiance is very nice, comfortable seating we were immediately offered a drink by 3 different waiters but they never arrived until prompted. Other than that the rest of the Service was impeccable probably one of the best I have seen in Toronto. What lets the place down very badly is the most important thing, the food! We had the special, the Wellington Beef with vegetables, the beef was not special it had no taste at all and all the vegetables were very over cooked, in fact they had shrivelled up! I felt totally robbed by the high price and poor meal. I have had better meals and steak at Pickle Barrel at half the price!"}
{"text":"I had a fabulous experience here!  From the moment I called to make a reservation I was greeted with a lovely hostess, no hassles whatsoever when I called back to change the reservation, and then again to let them know I'd be late - they were very pleasant and accommodating - a refreshing change from the norm!  The food, atmosphere, staff, and service were all impeccable.  No complaints.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"It was a nice restaurant. The food was good, but compared to their sister store Globe, it falls short. My boyfriend and I came here during Valentine's Day, and I understand how busy they would be on that day, but there really was no privacy in the restaurant. All the tables and chairs were really close together, and just getting up to go to the ladies restroom was hard having to squeeze between tables/chairs. It was a little hard to enjoy the food when all I could hear were the conversations from the tables next to us. The service was ok, taking to account how busy they were. When I have the chance I'd love to go back and try it and hopefully I'll give it a 5 star!"}
{"text":"The smoked trout and rosti was a delightfully light brunch menu option. It was a good choice to start the day if you do not want a heavy hangover type cure brunch.   The others in my dining party enjoyed the following with no complaints: the swine & dine smoked meat hash chef's grilled cheese"}
{"text":"I had the same situation like a fellow Yelper with my Groupon voucher about to expire, but I was able to book it and dine with my gf. We had the 4 course dinner for two.  The place is I guess intimate by the darkness, and they had outside patio and within the restaurant, they have another patio but inside which is nice. The washroom is a tad tiny. The restaurant was not busy, it was probably less than a quarter full of ppl, but the kitchen seem to be having a hard time producing meals efficiently.   Our starter app was a little taster of different things: octopus fennel, chick peas with arugula, beef tartare cranberry like, and duck confit. Among all the little taster, the duck confit wins. After trying this out we waited quite a bit for our apps...  My gf had hot tomato soup which took a while to come through, but def nothing special to report about.  Mine was the fried pork ribs with arugula and although the wait for this dish was quite long, the pork ribs was really good. But they seem to like arugula and puts it on quite a few of their dishes. They did give a few pieces extra for the wait so that was nice.   Fun Fact: They have a few location, and one of their location in the Westend can seat up to 600 PPL!!! That's crazy!  My main was the Duck Confit with lentils and steam tomato and spinach. The duck confit is tasty, but lack flavour along with the sides that were just steamed.  My gf had the Steak & frites with arugula on the side AGAIN!!! The frites tasted good, and the steak was finely cooked, but it did take a while again to serve it up.   The dessert we had was shared, and we ordered was some dry wall rock chocolate sauce with some cranberry and a scoop of whip cream. My gf got the toffee pudding which was better.   The service was fine b/c our food took long so they didn't have to bother us. When the food arrived, there was hit and misses. More misses. And with all that misses, I probably go check out other restaurants instead."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of healthy food. This place delivered, in a classy way. Great service, great smiles, great ambiance.   And it was still all down to Earth."}
{"text":"Attentive service, nice side patio... FANTASTIC rabbit main course and elk capaccio appetizer. Their menu seems to highlight Canadian game, fish and produce....kind of reminded me of a less pricey (slightly) version of Canoe in terms of menu. Would go back."}
{"text":"Very very good,and at times excellent says our party of five  First the positives:  funky decor, outstanding friendly service, appetizers especially the beet salad; healthy flat bread, caramel in the squash puree, apple-nut stuffing for the pancetta, steaks, all the desserts.  Moving on to the things that could be improved (and these are minor):  bench seating is about a full two inches lower than chair seating - not cool for dining nor for conversation unless you and your table mate are seriously mismatched in trunk length; pheasant a bit dry and a bit over salted; stuffed pancetta delish but a bit too fatty.  Definitely will go back as price point makes it great value for what you get. As for the chick who gave this place 2*s - hello, I ain't taking my dinner recs from someone whose idea of seasoning is barbecue sauce!  This place is for the discerning subtle palate...."}
{"text":"I ended up going to earth Bloor instead, because it's closer. So my apologies that my review is for the Bloor location, not Rosedale. I'm sure the experience is similar.  It was perfect patio weather, so we elected to dine on the rooftop patio. The patio itself was pleasant, but nothing special. Service was well paced, except it took a good 15 mins for the appetizer plate to arrive. But WOW, was it worth the wait. My date did not care for the elk meatball, but I thought was amazing. With the brie cheese, pickled onions and celery, I assembled an exotic mini-cheeseburger :-)  For the first course, we chose the fennel soup and the smoked ribs. The soup was so creamy delicious! And if the ribs were any more smokey, I would have to call 911!  Our second course was rainbow trout and Cornish hen. The trout had a perfectly seared crispy skin. The hen was OK, but nothing great. Maybe earth had set the bar too high after the first course. But in truth, I do a better pan-roasted Cornish hen, so one less star.  By the time dessert arrived, I was already full, but I never say no to dessert :-) Sticky toffee pudding was more like a cake. Chocolate pudding came with nice crunchy meringue cookie pieces.All good.  Overall, an excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"So my friends arranged an engagement brunch for me here at my request. I simply love the way the place is decorated and the look/feel of the place.    First off, the coffee is of premium quality. They come by for refills and give you water without you having to ask for it.  Baskets of a mix of croissants, scones, and some sort of donut were ordered for our party. Along with the baskets came two small pots of apple sauce - I dipped my hot delicious scone into it - the whole thing melts in your mouth.  The croissant were also very tasty - served with triangles of fresh butter.  In addition to the bread baskets, two types of flatbreads were served. One with tomatoe sauce, arugula, tomatoes & the other with tomatoes, sausage balls, and small semi cooked eggs on top.  Both were delicious.  I ordered the Pork Loin eggs benedict.  The plate came with hollandaise sauce and mini deep fried crunchy slices of potatoes with chives. There was a bit too much hollandaise sauce and the sauce was a tiny bit too sour, but overall it was well executed and very tasty.  One of my friends ordered a giant pancake.  It was one and a half inches thick.  It was moist topped with some kind of maple cream sauce...the whole thing melts in your mouth - very heavenly.  Dessert was also served...there was a delicious lemon square with meringue on top.  Very delicious.  Also, we had three flavored gelato - mango, creamy black currant, and burnt mashmellow.  Overall, the main meal came to $17 per person (main dish and coffee) with tax and tip, without counting the bread baskets/flat breads, which is very reasonable.    Parking can be found for free on the weekends if you take Roxborough and turn on Cluny Dr."}
{"text":"Holy crap.   My partner and I had SUCH an amazing dining experience here the other day.   We went using our Groupon for prix-fixe meals for 2, and despite this, we were still treated wonderfully and service was incredibly warm and attentive.   Not to mention everything they cooked for us was amazing! From the appetizer plate to all 3 courses, I have ZERO complaints about the food. It was perfectly cooked, delicious, and appeared exactly as the menu described it.   At the end when I asked the waiter to take a picture of us, he was so playful about it and made sure to take several pictures until I was satisfied with them. So nice!   We will definitely be back to pay full price. I enjoyed this place immensely."}
{"text":"Love the place:  atmosphere is nice, food is great, service is a hit or miss, but it's ok.  They have a very nice patio in the summer.  I highly recommend weekend brunch.  My only complaint is that portions sizes could be bigger."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their fresh and locate choices.  I will say the food matching is interesting.  I had the choucroute. My pork belly was on the dry side and I've never had so much sauerkraut on my plate in my life.  A nice saut√©ed green kale or collards would of been nice. I had the lemon curd for dessert. It was delicious.   Checked off the list but not worth the $100 bill for date night."}
{"text":"I experienced Earth for the first time (early Dec 2011).  I had been interested in trying this restaurant, based on their claim of sourcing local ingredients. I was very impressed with the service, food and moderate prices.    Service was prompt, friendly and entertaining (but not too much that we were annoyed by the effort).  The menu is varied but not too extensive. A number of game options which did not interest me personally.  I opted for the tenderloin, which can be purchased by the ounce (great idea) with a side of brussel sprouts (my fav), with a starter of mushroom soup (dairy less).  Everything our table ordered was excellent.  Great portion sizes and perfectly cooked, especially the tenderloin.    Also, I have gluten and dairy intolerance for which there were no issues ordering the options that I wanted.  This was a HUGE bonus for me.  Similar to  Magdalena R's experience, my group of four were comfortably chilling with our wine for quite some time. We never felt rushed to leave, even though it was near closing.   I look forward to returning to Earth. From a look at their menu, I am tempted to try their brunch.  The Yonge Street (Summerhill) location is quite spacious, which would make it a good restaurant option for larger groups."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how busy Earth was for a Wednesday night. I was there with a fairly large group of people because a  friend was in town from Vancouver. We ordered the charcuterie plate and a couple of flat breads (the healthy and the carnivore) for starters. The charcuterie was outstanding and the healthy flat bread was quite good as well. I didn't get to try the carnivore, but I was told that it was good by others at the table. For my main course I had the Tourtiere, I was slightly disappointed with it. I was hoping for a little bit more pop or excitement in the flavor. From all accounts from everyone else at the table their meals were quite enjoyable.   The service at Earth was outstanding. We were not the easiest group to deal with because our party size changed about 4 different times. Yeah, unfortunately we were \"THAT\" table. So thank you very much to the serving staff for putting up with us and really doing a good job of taking care of us.   All and all, I would definitely go back again, but probably wouldn't get the tourtiere. I think I would have to go with one of the daily specials next time. They sound very interesting the night we were there."}
{"text":"Worse place ever. The price is so not worth it.  I've never had a dinner that was $200 and I did not walk away full. seriously, my rack of lamb was all fat. Rude service too"}
{"text":"After wanting to visit Earth for a couple of years I was truly disappointed when my boyfriend and I went for Summerlicious. The food was subpar and the service was mediocre. I heard recently that they're closing and I'm not surprised."}
{"text":"Today I went to Earth Rosedale for Summerlicious Lunch for $15 with some friends.  The atmosphere is a little dim due to the dark ceilings. Our table was near the windows so it was a little brighter. It was hot and humid today, we opt out from the patio.   This place is great for large parties too, there's a room in the back near the washrooms for a table of 10 at least. Great for families with babies and kids. Tables are well spaced out, not crammed in. Jazzy music.  We were brought to our table. Another waiter filled our glass with water. Made our order maybe 15 mins later. No bread was given. (I saw the table next to ours had bread with the same Summerlicious menu). Do we get a different service b/c we didn't order wine?  I ordered: Chorizo Pogo as my appetizer. The batter was really hard. It was tough to break/slice into the pogo. i ate the sausage and not eat the batter.   Grilled Flank Steak as my main. The waiter didn't ask how i wanted my steak. It was pretty well done and dry. Would like some pepper or i need more pesto.  Strawberry Shortcake as my dessert.  This was not how i imagined it. It was still good. the cake was really dense and moist.  There was at last 20-30 minute wait between dishes. Even when we finished our dish there would be a wait time plus 15mins. Since i started lunch at 12:30 and ended at 3pm. So we had lots of time to talk and chill.   We had to flag down the waiter to refill our water. The service was mediocre. When we asked to split the bill the waiter mumble something that \"its the same for everyone.\" But since we were going dutch and paying by credit card, i thought we would make it clear for him that we are paying separately.  So at the end we made him do work and set up the machine to pay via credit card.  so overall $15 pretty good deal for Steak Summerlicious. Service was eh! maybe its just that one waiter. I like the environment. And the washrooms are clean, that's a plus!"}
{"text":"we had a wonderful experience and great early dinner last night.  we had a groupon deal we had purchased a while back that we even forgot all about it as we are from out of town. in fact the deal had expired but when i called the location couple of days ago they informed me they had extended the deal by couple of weeks which was already very nice of them to start with.  we arrived for an early dinner around 5pm as we also needed to drive home later being out of towners. as such, we also benefited from happy hour deals and got to taste few regular menu items that were on sale 50% off.  the restaurant itself was super fancy, nice, modern looking with a sophisticated look to it. we set on the front terrace and enjoyed a sunny day which was all awesome.  we had from the regular menu happy hour deal flat brad with goat cheese, caramelized onions and duck confie which was amazing mussels with asian sauce which were very tasty and uniquely done (never saw asian sauce as an option for mussels before....was super delicious, salty and left you wanting more)  from the groupon 4 course tasting menu we had appetizer platter which had on it beef tartar,chicken reiet (like chicken salad), salmon pure and goat cheese balls all were super tasty and very elegant  from appetizers we had cauliflower soup which was super creamy and very tasty as well the ribs  that were just average at best (some what dry)  from main dish we had the pasta which was very rich and delicious -parpadelle in mushroom creamy sauce. we also had the steak and fries but when we got to these we were already super full so ended up taking them to go as well as the cheese portion of dessert. we did enjoy the cheese cake platter which was super awesome and decadent  service was great and all portions were very generous  we dine often out and many high end restaurants of famous chefs and this restaurant far exceeded many of those places and the deals where just best!  few beers later and glass of wine and very few things could have gone better  highly recommend"}
{"text":"Locale is lovely, restaurant is well appointed, sadly lots of issues  - Got beer order wrong - Service was spotty (at best), server literally disappeared for a half hour - Booked a group and they didn't tell us they added an automatic gratuity so we all tipped (congrats! Made a few extra bucks and lost 10 customers forever!) and then felt like idiots when somebody looked at the bill when getting home.  None of us will return."}
{"text":"A friend suggest we give this place a try. A nice restaurant. Service and food are pretty good. I had the beef cheek as a main, it was good. Panna cotta was delicious but wasn't crazy about the rhubarb tart. Overall, it was a good good experience but not memorable."}
{"text":"This is the first time coming back to earth Rosedale since last year's Elite event. I confidently purchased a Groupon $74.99 for Prixe  Fixe Menu for 4 people, and came for dinner on a Thursday night.   With our Open Table reservation, we were seated immediately. The Prixe Fixe Menu offered a nice variety of dishes: 1. Appetizer: Smoked pork croquettes - served with maple mustard sabayon, pear salad, mustard greens. So good, but I could barely taste the pork.  2. Smoked steelhead trout - served with rooftop honey, celeriac pur√©e, brussels sprouts, pickled apricots. All the ingredients mashed together so well, and the fish itself was thick and tender.  3. Spiced Squash $6 - We ordered this on the side, and it was pretty much mashed squash with a dash of cinnamon. For the price/quantity, I could have just made this at home.  4. Dessert - the Sticky Toffee pudding is soaked in whisky caramel and poached pear, and way too sweet for me. The milk chocolate pudding was less sweet, served with espresso moon rocks, niagara black cherry and vanilla chantilly.   All the dishes came out nicely presented, and no particular dish disappointed us (besides the squash). This is a great spot for a romantic dinner - the lighting is dim and the ambiance is naturally romantic/intimate. The crowd is older (no kids in sight) and the noise level was low.   I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Chic yet unpretentious this great place offers refined local Canadiana food at its finest. Although they specialize in meat the fish and vegetable dishes are delish and equally deserving of praise. Awesome brunch too and exceptional wine list."}
{"text":"I came here last night for Winterlicious. The place was completely packed. Even though I had a reservation for 7pm, we still had to wait about 20-25 minutes for our table. Either they were waiting for a table to finish or something in the kitchen backed up their service. That wasn't a good start to the dinner.   I ordered the Smoked Trout Rilletes, Cassoulet and the Spice Cake. For the rilletes, the smoked trout rilletes were prepared beautifully with enough smokiness and saltiness. You might've thought the star of the dish was the chips since it had more of the plate than the trout. Spread around it all was a bearnaise aioli. I took chips, a bit of the rilletes and the sauce altogether and it all came together!   For the cassoulet, it might've looked small at the first glance but with the beans on the plate, it was pretty filling. The duck confit was mixed so well into the beans that each time you stuck your fork in, you would have small shreds of duck.   To end the dinner, I had a spice cake with vanilla creme fraiche on top. It appeared that the parts that did not have the caramel or creme fraiche on top were a tad dry. But there was enough to spread it all across to moisten everything up. Yummy!  Throughout the service, there were many little things that turned this review from a 3 to a 4. When my two friends went to the washroom, the server came by and folded up their napkins. When I went to the washroom, my napkin was also folded. As well, the server gladly took a moment to take 3 pictures for us even when it was very busy.   Overall, we left the night feeling very healthy!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The patio was nice and cozy, I love the hanging  plant baskets. The waiter was nice and helpful in making menu suggestions.  What I didn't like is waiting 25 mins for my entree and it being cold when we got it. By the time I got the food I was so tired and not hungry anymore I took a few bites and then asked to pack the rest, including my dessert to go. I got home and threw it all away the next day."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for sustainable.  The food was all quite good, with nothing exceptional nor disappointing enough to be especially memorable (no must-haves or to-avoids - just order what you feel like!). It's reasonably priced for the quality of food, ambiance, and service, and they also have prix fixes that cut down the price further. I should also mention, they clearly make an effort to be vegetarian friendly and their food is local and seasonal - which I really appreciate in a restaurant.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal here, and may well be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise.  We went here with a groupon and were pleasantly surprised.  The food here was quite good.  I'd come here again if I were in the mood for something a touch more upscale than casual.  Appetizer platter - Good assorted items.  The lamb sausage kofta was good. Soup of the day - Wasn't warm.  Could've been better. Ribs - Good.  Tender, sweet. Cornish hen - the outer breast portion was a bit dry to start, but once I worked my way in, it was moist.  Good. Parpadelle - very good.  They clearly made their own pasta, and even though it was vegetarian, was filling enough. Chocolate custard - solid. Sticky toffee pudding - solid.  Large portion.  No way my wife was going to finish that."}
{"text":"Yummy sweet potato soup Flatbread was seasoned well and cooked just right Had fish and game meat platter for entr√©es... They were okay.  Nothing too special about them..  I would still come back and try other things on the menu. .  It's a very nice ambience and servers were great"}
{"text":"We had a really lovely brunch at Earth on Sunday. A table for 8 was set aside via opentable. The staff were really understanding as our numbers fluctuated. Reservation made for 8, we arrived slowly, later thought we were only 7, half way through brunch, our 8th showed up unexpectedly. Also, I LOVE reservations when I'm going for brunch with a table larger than 2. Also when I'm suffering from a Hot Yoga Hangover. (It's just like a regular hangover, but induced from dehydration from a hot yoga class the day before. BRUTAL.)  The service was impeccable. Very friendly, our waiter kept the coffee, water and tea pots filled, and was in good spirits, joking along with our table.  We ordered the bread basket ($10) to start and got 2 peanut danishes, 2 coffee cream muffins (AMAZING), and a raisin strudel. It was a nice way to break into the meal.  I split the french toast ($11) and the Swine and Dine ($14) with a lovely lady friend. (Pork 6 ways? Yes. Yes please.) The eggs were nice, although there was a bit of an oil slick on top. The best part of the pork was the rashers (bacon). They were VERY salty, but totally delicious. The creton was the best I've ever had, and I've spent years in Quebec. The sausage was meh, but overall the breakfast was fun. The french toast was sitting in a pool of maple syrup. I LOVE that they don't skimp on the real maple syrup! (That being said, there was a LOT, and it was impossible to eat the french toast without every bite being totally soaked in syrup. I might ask for it on the side next time.)  Tea is $5 a pot, which is a little steep (get it? Ha?), but they happily refilled my pot, and they have a fun selection of loose tea to choose from.  Bills ranged from $20-$27."}
{"text":"Earth is a modern and cozy restaurant. There is plentiful seating surrounded by floor to ceiling windows in the bright space.  Our group of 4 started our Sunday brunch with mimosa's and the fresh Baker's Basket. It was amazing! Highly recommended. The basket contained a danish with a peanut butter centre, large almond croissant, and a cranberry muffin ($10).  We ordered the Chef's Brekkie, Eggs Benny, and Swine & Dine (who can complain about pork being done 6 ways?).  I especially liked the hot temperature of the Chef's Brekkie that came out on  a mini cast iron skillet. It was fully loaded with navy beans and pieces of duck. Best part was the duck fat sourdough soldiers!  No complaints about service - our waiter was fantastic.  Just also wanted to point out the selection of tea is almost as big of their wine list!!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars to a restaurant but my experience at Earth tonight was superb. As good as it gets! I came here with a groupon that offered a 4 course meal for $39.  Unlike some prix fixed menus I've had, this one did not skimp on portions or quality.  First off, the ambience is lovely. Gorgeous light fixtures  and dark wood. Also spacious so we didn't feel like we were sitting with the table next to us.  My friend and I shared the appetizer plate which was toasted sesame rolled goat cheese and octopus salad and this delightful, refreshing salad that i think was fennel.  All were very tasty.  We then had the mushroom soup, which was pureed mushrooms -- unlike anything I've had before and absolutely delicious. Our server let us know it was non dairy without us even asking, which was very thoughtful.  We had the trout for our main, which was also delicious. Large portion, and served in pureed parsnip with dried apricots - YUM.  I was full at this point, but desert came with our meal so we had the sticky toffee pudding and the cheese board. The cheese board was small, but to be honest we were stuffed. The cheese was fantastic, garnished with walnuts, crustini and some type of  dried berry.  The sticky toffee was so good that I'm actually still thinking about it now and I'm not even a big fan of desert.   The service was excellent. Super friendly, non intrusive staff made our night beautiful.   I know I'll be coming back here. Earth is out of this world! (had to do it...)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at Earth!  Fresh, locally grown produce put together in mouthwatering dishes, amazingly attentive service and great atmosphere.   Cozy side patio was really private, hidden away from the street noise...  Watch out for the sourdough bread served with butter - Dangerously good.  Flatbread carnivore appetizer - yam! We have ordered rib eye steak and lamb with side of mushrooms and  jalape√±o sweet potato mash.  Everyone was extremely pleased with their choices... The dishes were   not spiced heavily allowing the freshness and the quality of ingredients to be the major attraction.  Enjoyed every bite! Unfortunately dessert became an unattainable goal after two bottles of wines. (Fantastic wine btw!) I will definitely be back to this wonderful spot... highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Heard amazing things about Earth, so maybe I was expecting too much! Went for dinner, there was only 1 seafood option and the rest of the menu didn't really stand out. The good tasted good, but by no means was it special or unique in anyway.  They are really great about substitutions and the staff is friendly.  Won't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Back in the fall, I bought a deal via FabFind (spend $25 get $50) to eat at Earth. This past weekend, my girlfriend and I finally got around to making use of the voucher. We decided at the last minute (5pm on a Saturday) to see if we could get a table at a reasonable time. We were told that the earliest available table they had that evening was 830pm. By chance we arrived early at around 815 and were told that the prior seating for our table never arrived, so we were seated immediately.   Prior to the delivery of our meal we were each provided a very nice buttery rosemary biscuit. I thought this was a nice touch compared to the standard white bread that is provided at many establishments.   For starters we shared one of the flatbread options ($12) (I believe it had duck, and ricotta cheese on it). On the whole, I'd say it was tasty. It was crisp and just the right size to whet our palates for the main course.  After we finished the flatbread and our plates had been bussed from the table, a few minutes went by and our waiter arrived with a few complimentary potato/leek soups (as there was a delay in the kitchen in terms of our mains). I thought that this was a very nice touch as we could have been waiting for another 10 minutes for our mains. This, in my opinion, is the difference between a 3 star and a 4 star restaurant.  For mains my girlfriend chose the Rainbow Trout, and I went with the Fettucine pasta with duck meat sauce ($20). I had no complaints regarding my main. It was filling and tasty all at once. I had asked my girlfriend what she thought of the trout and she said that it was ok, but not worthy of a 5 star restaurant (she's a tough critic in my opinion).  I had a taste of it and thought that it was perfectly acceptable. I think she had higher expectations for a main that cost $22.  I would have gone for dessert as there appeared to be a few appealing options, however I was so stuffed from dinner, I erred on the side of caution.  At the end of the night, I asked her what she would have rated the restaurant. She gave it a 3.5/5 rating. I would have given it a 4.5/5 rating (as Yelp doesn't allow for half ratings, I'm bumping it up to a 5).    As far as the service was concerned, there were no complaints. The staff were friendly, and our server took the time to explain a few items on the menu that were unfamiliar to me.  Conclusion: If you're looking for a nice place to dine in the Rosedale area, you can't go wrong with Earth."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and great ambiance.  The dishes are well thought out and the organic availability and presence of this menu is quite good.  The prices are fairly reasonable and it is a great place for a quite evening eating delicious gourmet meals."}
{"text":"My friends took me to this Rosedale haunt for a quintessential Canadian meal  - Wild Boar, elk flatbread: very gamey, generous helping of meat, but yummy; glad we split it between the 3 of us! - Charcuterie: simple. the deep fried ball of head cheese was my fave but really have to take it in small doses - Squash and Mushroom Taglioni: flavorful, light and delish- i really enjoyed this pasta dish  It was pretty empty on a Sunday evening; but it was a huge restaurant"}
{"text":"Another day, another restaurant.  I don't think I have ever dined out as much as this week but I can't help it that my best friend is in town and there is this bustle of social activity going on that surrounds food... Guess that's why we're best friends!  Doctor-to-be, (D2B) and Marketing Babe, my 2 best friends and I met up for dinner prior to the Yelp Elite event at Cafe Monroe.  D2B picked the restaurant tonight, and he did me proud!  Earth is located steps away from Rosedale subway station.  The decor is lounge-y chic, and the seating was extremely comfortable.  We got a table right by the window which is always nice.  Earth is a restaurant that runs on the philosophy of \"slow food.\"  No it doesn't mean you'll be waiting hours for  your food.  The slow food movement was founded by Carlo Petrini in 1986 to counteract fast food.  The premise is to encourage the cultivation and use of local produce.  Everything on the menu (save for seafood, since we are not near a port of any kind) comes from local producers within a 100-mile radius.    I sipped on a Lychee Martini while waiting for my fashionably late BFFs to arrive.  The server, Antony (such a sweetheart) did warn me that they can make my favourite martini, but that unfortunately they don't have any lychees for garnish.  I was a  little disappointed, but the martini was so good that it was a moot point.  My BFFs finally arrived and a Cider 'Tini and Sweet Thyme were ordered.  The Sweet Thyme is a drink made from vodka, ice wine, thyme, simple syrup and crystallized thyme.    The \"bread basket\" that we were brought was quite a surprise as it was a Buttermilk Thyme Biscuit.  It was very flaky on the outside, and dense, and soft on the inside.  Yummy!  Marketing Babe ordered the soup of the day, which was a Cauliflower Soup topped with Chili Oil to start.  It was a perfect companion to the Buttermilk Thyme Biscuit.    For mains, we ordered the \"Finest Plate\" which today, was a quail served on herb-roasted potatoes and a bed of red peppers, raisins, and pine nuts with scallops.  The quail was perfectly seared with a nice browning of the skin while the meat was extremely tender and moist.    I ordered the Rabbit Loin, and I am still having dreams about it at work.  It was wrapped in bacon, served atop a bed of soft polenta, with a butternut squash ragu.  It was absolutely and utterly delicious.  The smokey flavour of the bacon was just amazing and no additional salt was needed to season the rabbit as the salts of the bacon served to infuse it with intense flavour.  The polenta was extremely creamy and savoury and sure beats the hell out of a boring mashed potato.  The most disappointing dish of the night was the Veal which consisted of braised cheeks, sweetbreads, and a blue mash.  While it was extremely moist and tender, it lacked in flavour and was very bland.  The same can be said of the mashed potatoes that accompanied it.   We also got a plate of Yukon Gold Fries for the table.  Their fries are fried in duck fat. Need I say more?  I think not.  Our server Antony was extremely attentive and explained the specials down to the very minute details.    All in all a great dining experience.  The food is delicious, and prepared in their wood oven and the atmosphere is relaxing.  It is great for a group of friends or for date night.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this restaurant. The food is always good, in fact, it's a great spot for weekend brunch. Ambiance is great for a night out with friends, family or just yourself and a special someone. I actually had my wedding reception here and it was a fantastic evening - great food in a beautiful space and the staff were amazing. A must visit in the city of Toronto."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dining experience here... great vibe, great food, great service.  I had a dining experience of a lifetime here - I think one of the best meals I've ever had, fully indulged in all that this restaurant has to offer.  I tried almost everything on the menu:  RODNEY'S OYSTERS - fresh and delectable, served with fresh horseradish and the fixing's made the fresh oysters an experience on it's own.  RED FIFE GNOCCHI - delicious, served in veggies and fresh pasta, this flavor was rich but not too filling.  CHEESE PLATE (ONTARIO CHEESE BOARD) - in between, the waiters brought out this cheese plate that was extrodinary, the cheeses they had were clearly from a specialty shop had different textures and taste - it was awesome.  TENDERLOIN - this was light and chewy, cooked to perfection in medium rare.  Steak at it's best.  EVERSPRING FARM'S MUSCOVY DUCK - this dish was my fav, the duck was done medium rare, so it was very tender and tasted smokey - served on a bed of lentils, it was filling but very very satiable.  SIDES - WE chose 3: YUKON GOLD FRITES, ROASTED CAULIFLOWER AND MAPLE SQAUSH PUREE - the maple squash puree was out of the planet, was like nothing I've ever tasted and was my favorite side thing on the menu.  It was like a mashed something, dessert-like and just plain heaven.  DESSERT: HOMEMADE SORBET and ICE CREAM - what a way to end off the meal, it was fresh and the ingredients were definately not artificial.  RIDICULOUS RIGHT???  All this in one night, plus a bottle of moet, red and some cocktails - that's a girl's night wrapped up in a cozy blanket!!!  This was amazing, and I really thing it is contributed to the good company and the humongous amount of food we ordered.  The service was top knotch, I agree with reviewer before this, were very attentive and informative without being annoying.  AMAZING - must go, right away."}
{"text":"Had a SPECTACULAR time!  Took my friend there for her birthday and we were spoiled.  The server (Al) was engaging without being intrusive.  The food was original and the tastes were out of this world.  We were taken care of beautifully.  I would highly recommend dining at this restaurant and I will return soon!"}
{"text":"Great decor, location relatively convenient, service was good but my food was not cooked properly.  I ordered one of their specials that day, the filet mignon and asked for medium well, but ended up with a steak that was 3/4 super rare and 1/4 medium-rare. Blood was oozing out of that steak and the meat was extremely tough and chewy, almost as if it wasn't even cooked. I only ate the parts that were done medium-rare. For the price I paid, I was hoping for at least a steak that was edible.  My fiances dish was pretty good, so this restaurant still deserves at least 3 stars. If i do come back it won't be for steak that's for sure."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks back and really enjoyed it. The ambiance was really warm, with rather stylish interior including a high end feel but still a level of comfortability instead of snooty and pretentiousness. Lots of windows looking into patio space including a cute garden patio on the side which looked really cool as the snow fell.  The wine list is huge, lots of obscure choices to work with if that's your game. Limited, but craft based draught beer selection.  For apps, unlike a lot of reviews I thought the pig bits were a good size for $8, in fact if anything my only complaint was that there wasn't enough crostini for the amount of pig bits. We also had the Farmers Flatbread which was out of this world. I could probably come and just eat a couple of those on their own and leave satisfied.  Up until the mains we were on course or a 5 star meal. Unfortunately I was quite underwhelmed with the rib-eye and frites. The meat was a bit too dry and the frites while nicely seasoned, were a tad overcooked and too crispy for my liking.  I really hate ordering the most expensive thing on the menu and being disappointed, but I left with a full belly and everything else was great, and also have to say the service was friendly and attentive, so I'm already over it and looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I went to Earth last night and I can honestly say it was the worst meal I have had in a LONG time.  The service was excellent, our host and waiter were lovely but the food was overpriced and underwhelming to say the least.  We both did not feel like main courses so we ordered a selection of dishes.    The oysters were from Rodney's they were fine but they were west coast oysters and we both prefer east coast.  Then the flatbread came - we chose Healthy:   best baa feta, taggiasche olive, white balsamic oregano reduction.  Sounded great but meh.  No strong taste and the crust was too floury in taste.  Then the Ontario pig bits which looked so unappetizing I couldn't even bother and the 100 mile greens salad which was limp served with frozen berries.  We left utterly disappointed.  I live in the neighborhood and I am surprised that this place is still around with all the great options surrounding it.  We expressed our opinion to the host who was lovely but I cannot see us giving Earth another try."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch with a friend last weekend.  We didn't have a reservation, but it wasn't a problem, we were seated on the side patio right away.  Summerlicious had completely slipped my mind, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the Summerlicious offering on the menu when our server brought them over.  My friend order the eggplant flatbread ($12) and I had the heirloom tomato salad with smoked paprika aioli, followed by grilled flank steak and matchstick potatoes, and a pistachio custard and salted chocolate mousse ($15 for the entire lunch - thank you Summerlicious).  Everything we ordered was delicious and our server was amazing.  We really enjoyed the side patio...it actually felt more like a courtyard.  They have a lovely fountain at the front of the patio and it's sheltered from the sun, which was great last weekend, given the sweltering heat.    The overall d√©cor is simple and elegant, it's the kind of place you walk into and instantly know that you're going to have a wonderful experience.  The menu is not overwhelming...they do a few things and they do them well.  Prices are reasonable and the wine list was ok.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Earth is on the fence between 3 & 4 stars.  Good menu, nice atmosphere...finally a restaurant that has made it work in that location...remember 1055? - Love some of the flexibility on the menu, like ordering meat by the oz and find the service pretty good.  Last time I was there, we sent all our soups back cold and it seemed like the kitchen was asleep and not really seasoning as per usual.  I think it is a good spot for work dinners / groups and I will continue to frequent, but won't be raving about it...just another consistently good place that you think about when the cool spots are packed or you are looking to book a group..."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for summerlicious!!!  Earth Rosdale Global is around the corner from Rosedale TTC Subway station, so its location is very convenient.   First off, the decor and ambience is creates a calm, chic, yet romantic setting with the dim avant lighting, soft cushiony seats, and booths.  Not to mention they have an enclosed patio facing Yonge St. or their optional courtyard patio.  The open concept kitchen makes this place look a lot bigger, so its a plus! Came here with THE MOM for an early dinner.  Thankfully we were able to try each others dishes so I was able to comment on so many lol!!! most of all ...ITS ALL LOCAL INGREDIENTS!  Chilled Courgette Soup 4/5 Garlic croutons, goat's cheese, fresh herbs.  The goat cheesereally brought out the characteristics of this soup, adding a salty yet creamy and smooth kick to the bowl.  The croutons helped absorb the goat cheese along with the courgette.  Very creative indeed!!  Smoked Sturgeon 5/5 Sorrel potato salad, pickled onions, upland cress. Lets just say WOW!! you can taste the lovely smokey flavor of this sturgeon! yum all the way, it felt like eating raw, though cooked, sushi lol... the pickled onions balanced the more blander flavors of the potato salad which inevitably complimented the sturgeon!   Hay Roasted Pork Tenderloin 4.5/5 Algonquin corn grits, savoy spinach, charred red onion chutney. Perfect balance of sweetness with the corn grits, and red onions to compliment the charred pork.  The savoy spinach was a great addition to this dish since there were strong flavorful components to this meal....it definitely added balance!!   Grilled Flank Steak (upgrade to Tenderloin) 4.5/5 Northern woods mushroom pea fricassee, allumette potato, scallion pesto  we upgraded this dish and ordered their tenderloin cut, and we were glad, cooked medium well, the allumette potato is a must!!   Pistachio Custard 4/5 Chocolate mousse, dacquoise, sea salt  No better way to end it off with a smooth, savory, not overly sweet chocolate mousse! perfect all the way  Dulce de Leche Ice Cream Sandwich 3.5/5 Chocolate ganache  You can never go wrong with this, however had a tough time trying to break it with my spoon...though yummy! it was quite hard...lol  Overall this is an awesome place, and I'm glad that I was able to kick my summerlicious off on the right foot.   *************************************************************************** btw!!!! CHECK IN!! AND YOU GET A FREE DESSERT WITH PURCHASE OF AN ENTREE!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Here for Happy Hour.  We were not greeted at all.  The manager said to us, \"What can I do for you?\"  She didn't even get out of her chair nor look us in the eye.  As she proceeded to seat us inside, I asked to sit outdoors and then she just handed us off to be sat by a server, no, \"So and so will seat you, enjoy your meal\" or anything to that sort.  It didn't seem that the kitchen was prepared for Happy Hour as 1/2 dozen fresh oysters took about 30 minutes to arrive.  What really saved the experience was the food.  Absolutely fresh and delicious.  They use a smoked technique for their marinades.  I recommend coming for Happy Hour when all of their appetizers which are all shareable are half priced.  Flat bread normally $12 is $6.  Oysters are $1 each instead of $3."}
{"text":"From the lovely coat check person/greeter to Antony our server, we were treated so warmly, patiently and with great care.  Very sheik restaurant in haute couture location of Rosedale, five minute walk north of the Subway station. Parking on nearby east-west streets.  Used OpenTable to book a 615 pm Valentine Dinner for me and my gal and we were not disappointed. We left at 830 pm satiated, smiling and seriously happy.  I'm a meataterian and she is a vegetarian so our dinner plans are sometimes a struggle - meaning that usually one of us are happier than the other. Not tonight!  I dined on the marrow salad and the steak with baby potatoes and green beans, while she had the veg consomme soup with gnocci and vegetarian moussaka (hearty caulliflower).  Everything was excellent, including the buttermilk biscuits before the meal.  As you'll read from other reviewers, all the food is local...well, almost all. They had to go outside the 100 mile limit for tonights menu but not that much.  The wine list is outstanding with so many excellent Niagara wines...looking for some great Prince Edward County wines soon...such as Rosehall Run or Troumpers Mill.   Attention to detail is the norm at Earth. If you care about what goes into you and you want to feel cared for, try this lovely oasis."}
{"text":"Had a great waiter serving us on Friday. He was friendly and great with explaining and suggesting alternatives for my friend who tries to be gluten-free on a  very busy Friday night.   We had a lovely vegan mushroom soup to start. Good portion. Still filling.  I had the trout with a celery root puree or was it parsnip? One of those vegetables. The two were great. It also came with Brussels sprouts, but it's the style where the sprinkle the leaves on your plate. It's not cut in halves. That was steamed/blanched. it didn't have any flavour to it so that didn't do anything to the plate. It was more for my veggie in take I gather. There's also pickled apricot on the side, but I'm not a fan of that so I just left it there. Trout was great, I enjoyed that.  Ended with Sticky toffee pudding.  It was yummy, not a dense one but still very flavourful. Nice poached pear slices topped off the dessert. It was yummy.   Seems to be a family crowd that goes in before 8 and all the patrons with children left by 830. Some on dates, some were small groups of friends / families.   Service was good!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant.  The food is great, everything is fresh and cooked perfectly. Not much point in commenting on exactly what to order as the menu changes according to local availability.  The ambiance is perfect... upscale but not pretentious. The earth themes are very well done. The whole experience was only slightly marred by a less than friendly waitress."}
{"text":"Food is great. Came once for brunch once for dinner. This place isn't as packed as it should be. Brunch is definitely fresher / healthier than dinner. The soups were my favourite soups I've ever had. Will go again sometime."}
{"text":"Everything in this place is perfect.  The atmosphere is nice, the service is attentive while not annoying, the food is amazing, the bathrooms are spotless, and I could go on and on.  On my first visit, at brunch, I had the Swine and Dine while my friend had the quiche.  The quiche ($12) was the largest serving I have ever seen, and was cooked perfectly (in other words, not a solid lump as many places serve it).  My Swine and Dine ($14 I believe) was pork done 5 different ways, three eggs (I had poached), mushrooms and tomato, and some toast to soak up the eggs.   I completely disagree with a previous reviewer who said that they were grossed out because the dish was too much meat.  Although it was a lot of food, no one says you have to eat it all, and every item was delicious.  My only critique is that they charged my friend $5 for an order of green tea.  It was a nice pot of green tea but it seems odd to over charge for green tea when the prices of everything else were so reasonable.  I will be going back for dinner and will update then."}
{"text":"Came here in a party of 5 for Father's Day dinner! I made a reservation on OpenTable, natch.   FOOD:  They had a $35 three course prix fixe for Father's Day, which was a pretty good deal, although you could only choose your appetizer (soup or salad). There was no choice for the main (prime rib) or dessert (brownie with some kind of crystalized syrup thing with *bacon*?!). My Dad went for it and really enjoyed it. The salad came in a very generous portion served on a huge plate. The bacon dessert thing was a mystery. It said bacon on the menu but I tried a bite of the brownie and didn't taste any bacon... so we assumed it was in the crystally thing. I guess we'll never know.   As for the rest of us... sibling found a fruit fly floating in the broth that the oysters came in. Kinda gross... but understandable. I mean, drosophila are everywhere this season and they breed like mad. The server looked appalled when she pointed it out, and abruptly took the bowl and ran to the kitchen without saying a word (interesting response). He came back and apologized, said he had told the manager, and that they would give us a free glass of wine.   I quite enjoyed the crispy ewenity curds... Basically huge chunks of cheese deep fried in a tempura-like batter. The cheese was all gooey and soft inside and the batter was crispy and delicious (although oily... I would recommend getting this to share and distributing the high fat content that way).   I had the baked spring vegetable tart. I wasn't feeling particularly meat-y and the menu is pretty meat-heavy. But the tart was nice and flaky with goat cheese, eggplant, peppers and zucchini. The menu said asparagus, but there was no asparagus to be found (I looked hard). It came with a nice side salad.   For dessert, I had the panna cotta. The smoked vanilla flavour was nice, but otherwise I've had better. The portion was actually bigger than I expected.   I would recommend trying one of their cocktails, they all sounded so yummy! I had the ''sweet thyme'' which has ice wine in it. Perhaps it's a bit too syrupy sweet for some, but I loved it.   SERVICE:  Service was fine. Nothing special but they checked up on us frequently enough. The maitre d' looked really bored. I felt bad for her.   SPACE: The dining room is modern and glam, with cool light fixtures and clean lines. There are 2 patios - one out front facing Yonge and another on the side of the restaurant. There is also a private dining room at the back near the washrooms that looks very nice.   Nice ambiance, tasty local food, and reasonable prices (especially when they have a prix fixe). This is a good place for a special occasion and got the stamp of approval from my Dad."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a close friend's birthday in a party of four. We ate, we drank, we spent 3.5 hours at Earth having a fantastic time. No one rushed us, we were well taken care of by our waiter, and the manager came by to make sure we were having a great experience.   The food was fabulous in two ways; the taste was amazing, and the presentation was gorgeous. The guest of honour was vegan, and the chef had no problem creating a beautiful vegan meal for her (off the menu) that she said tasted amazing.   The furniture is modern, the ambiance is relaxed, and if you choose to spend your evening here, I believe you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have had a great meal each time.  BRUNCH: I believe I went on a Sunday so it surprised me that we were 2 of 4 customers in the restaurant. They were new I guess. I had the eggs benedict. It was pretty good. The buttermilk biscuit was a nice touch.  My friend had the swine and dine which was pork 6 ways. It was absolutely gluttonous and way too much food. It's interesting that they make their own crackling (it seems, anyhow). That much pork on a plate for some reason grossed me out and I love meat. He couldn't finish it, it was too much. Some of it was pretty tasty though. This is ideal for the caveman of the bunch.  Overall, yummy eggs benny and a selection of loose leaf teas.   DINNER: Monday night, the place was packed. The lighting is way nicer in the evening than on a Sunday morning, and the food was pretty impressive. The organic mixed greens were tossed in a house dressing. It was very good, with just the right amount of everything. Just basic greens and toasted/popped pumpkin seeds to add a nice texture and roasted/nutty flavour. Very nice.   The elk tartare was quite good as well, flavoured perfectly and the soft-boiled quail eggs were yummy. The presentation was lovely, and I now think that I love elk tartare way more than beef tartare, thanks to this restaurant.  For my main, I ordered a steak by the pound (so an 8 oz. ribeye). I found there to be no seasoning so I found the taste a bit bland. The cut of meat itself was pretty yummy, I just wish there was some flavour on the steak. After all, I am at a restaurant not pan frying a steak on the electric coil stove in a basement apartment. The \"salsa verde\" that came with it--which was nothing like salsa verde at all--tasted like greens+ pur√©ed with parsley. Apparently it had other things in it but I found it disgusting. It actually took away from the taste of the steak and  I had to leave it. It looked like slime and tasted like slime. They should really not put it on the menu.  My friend ordered the cornish hen which seemed to be a bit dried out, or maybe I didn't have a proper bite. Presentation was lovely though.  The side order of carrots were mediocre and I don't suggest ordering them. It says they're roasted with cardamom, and for the word \"cardamom\" to be on the menu I expected to actually taste it. There was no cardamom flavour in the least. \"Roasted carrots\" would've sufficed.  For dessert we got the chocolate torte and the apple crumble with sharp aged white cheddar ice cream. The chocolate torte was pretty good but compared to other fine dining experiences involving chocolate, it was mediocre. The apple crumble though, was absolutely delicious! I recommend getting it. The cheddar cheese ice cream sounds strange at first but it's actually an interesting flavour.  They get their loose leaf tea across the street from House of Tea. The tea was pretty good and I'm glad they offer a selection of loose leaf tea.  Presentation was nice. Service was friendly and helpful. The red wine suggestion from the server was delicious (but it's unfortunately not sold in the LCBO!).  Overall, great atmosphere, good presentation, good wine, delicious appetizers and desserts, but mains are lacking in flavour.   Must-haves at Earth: Brunch: eggs  benny Dinner: organic mixed greens salad, elk tartare, apple crumble dessert, and the server's suggestion for red wine if you're into it.  I would definitely come back but I would hope that their mains improved. They were not nearly as savoury as the appetizers and desserts that we had. Presentation is lovely, the atmosphere is beautiful, service is friendly and looked quite professional, except for the one guy in faded tapered jeans who brought out the mains, not quite sure what that was about but it definitely took away from the overall professionalism and smart casual dress.  Good eats to be had at Earth if you're willing to spend some money on a good meal, just be careful about choosing the right main, which I'm not even sure exists yet."}
{"text":"Very pleasant staff and dining room.    The food -- not so good.  The flat bread is more-or-less like a Trader Joe's pizza, good enough but not what I expected. The trout was dry and the couscous had way too much Swiss chard.  Avoid the trifle desert."}
{"text":"After much deliberation, I selected this restaurant to try for Summerlicious, but I left disappointed. But it seems to have excellent reviews from other users, so maybe I just selected the wrong dishes.   For my appetizer I had the tomato salad with paprika aioli, garlic crouton, basil and queso fresco. It would have just been an ordinary tomato salad had it not been for the paprika aioli - this unique touch added great flavour to the dish!  I was disappointed in my entree though. I had the arctic char in smoked tomato broth with fennel, dill, and baby potatoes. It was pretty terrible. The fish was overcooked and the overall dish lacked any flavour.   Luckily the dulce de leche ice cream sandwich with chocolate ganache for dessert slightly made up for it. It was good, except for the ice cream filling which tasted cheap.  So the food may not have been a hit for me, but the service was excellent and very friendly. I also loved the dark, earthy decor and comfortable seating."}
{"text":"A Groupon deal of Prix Fixe Menu for 2 at $50 gave me another chance to dine at earth Rosedale and the experience was equally delightful!  My coupon was honoured gracefully without another complication and I had great professional services.   We tried:  Appetizer: - Arugula Salad  Soup: - Fish Chowder - Mushroom Puree  Main: - Rainbow Trout - Steak Frites ($7 additional to upgrade to Tenderloin)  Dessert: - Wild Ontario Berry Frangiapane - Popcorn Panna Cotta  Anything were nicely presented and delicious! The portion size is their standard offers and quite a good value when I get to use my coupon!  Love the courtyard seating when the weather is nice..... I definitely recommend earth Rosedale if you looking for a quiet and laid back restaurant for brunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Just as good as it gets. Wonderful food, chic but unpretentious environment, charismatic service. We've been three times and have only had good things to say about it. Go here for a simple, (almost) healthy and mid priced meal!"}
{"text":"It's not often that I leave a genuinely five-star dinner with five kinds of animal swimming in thyme-flavored liquid in my stomach.  At Earth, Man Candy and I found what I consider to be a seriously rare combination of elements : remarkable service, modern and polished interior design, mouthwateringly delicious food, and perfectly concocted drinks.  We started with the elk tartare, which was pungent and delicious, and our server even offered us extra chips when we were running low. It had a fantastic texture and was not filling. Perfect for an appetizer. Man Candy couldn't resist the fact that he could order 2oz of lamb rack, and so he ordered 4, which worked out to two small chops, perfectly cooked medium as we'd asked. The only slight gripe is no fault of Earth's : the gristle was not crispy, which I imagine would be hard to accomplish with medium cooking of a thin chop.  Man Candy and I ordered a couple of drinks. Mine, the sweet thyme, was sweet and tangy, with candied thyme in it. Though slightly difficult to drink because of the sticks, I enjoyed it immensely. Man Candy had the best bloody mary every. I don't particularly like them, but I was slurping it down while he wasn't looking.  Our mains, mine the rabbit, Man Candy's the burger, were delivered almost fifteen minutes from the moment our appetizers were taken away. My only real complaint about the evening was that my rabbit, though delicious, was heavily salted. I'm not generally one to complain about a little NaCl, but this was a bit excessive. My rabbit was wrapped in bacon, and perhaps sous vide cooked and then seared to cook the bacon? Whatever the method, it made for an intensely soft meat, delicious to chew. It was served atop leek spaetzel, which was coated with the most delicious marsala cooked mushrooms.   Man Candy, when ordering his burger, ordered it as rare as they would make it. Generally, this means he will get a little pink. But he means RARE when he says it. He'd rather his burger moo at him then be cooked, but he'll deal. Anyway, his burger was actually cooked blue rare. It was a purist burger : no fancy toppings, no fancy mix-ins in the meat. Just delicious prime rib meat cooked exactly as ordered. Man Candy also had a massive number of fries, which, once he rubbed the salt off of them one-by-one, were delicious.  I wish I could say we'd tried dessert, because there was a brownie on the menu that sounded amazing. But by that time, we were both at the full point where any more food would result in imminent belly assplosion.  All in all, I wish we had more restaurants like this home in San Diego. Maybe it was the vacation, maybe it was the food, maybe it was the OUTSTANDING service here, but this was a really memorable dining experience, and it rang in at an amazing below 100 bucks."}
