{"text":"Would not come back here because the food is extremely bland and dry. Had the southwest chicken sandwich. The two \"pieces\" of bacon were bite size. The chicken was so dry it was hard to cut through and just not seasoned at all. Had a side of seasonal vegetables; this included broccoli, semi-steamed and again no seasoning. My suggestion is to use salt or other seasonings. Maybe add some chipotle to the southwest chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"You know, this place was pretty good. I had the Atlantic salmon with seasonal vegetables (all broccoli), but I didn't mind. Wait staff was great, food came out fast, hot, and tasty. Salmon and veggies cooked perfectly. I'm happily surprised as I just didn't feel like jumping in my car to find something and felt the quality was right here. This is located in the Embassy Suites. Great choice for me..."}
{"text":"This is THE GO TO for people who travel and enjoy cocktails and great breakfast.. FOR FREE!! I've stayed here at least a dozen times and will tell you I have met some of the most fascinating people ever st this bar.  If you have some negative things to say about this place, then maybe you should USE YELP to find a place that would be better.... #getoveryourself"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Got the taco special and was so impressed I got a 2nd order to go!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stop by the hotel restaurant because I was too tired to consider more driving.  Food was served quickly and decent.  The salmon and two sides was priced well for what was recieved.  It was not really to rave about.  Service was okay, but you could tell they were short staffed and not focused on cleanung because several tables were not bussed or wiped down.   Honestly next time I would sit at the bar because the bartender seemed on top of it.  He appeared friendly, was helping bus tables and chatting up guys at the bar about various topics.  Take away, friendly place to grab a drink and okay place to eat."}
{"text":"The restaurant is hidden within the hotel. First ordered the chicken wings for an appetizer , they tasted bland and kinda like cardboard.. No seasoning at all. The stuffed chicken was not seasoned and the fish was dry and black in the center, Why??? The Mac n cheese was not seasoned either, what a surprise. The fries were surprisingly good and fresh, surprise surprise! Nothing else was. Oh and the gold fish from the salad bar was good to, but that's a little hard to mess up since they are store bought."}
{"text":"I've stayed at this Embassy Suites for extended periods while working in PHX and have always had a great experience here.  The food is what you'd expect it to be for a hotel.  I recommend the salmon, wings, and the buffalo chicken wrap.  The bar staff is very attentive and how can you beat a free happy hour every evening for hotel guests?  If you're looking for a nice meal onsite during your stay, this is a great option."}
