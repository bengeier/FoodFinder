{"text":"Amazing place to eat I love there seafood order baby shrimp and cold slaw fries and a chicken grill salad so good me and my boo ate here"}
{"text":"I've grown up in the Fort Mill Area and this place is hands down probably the best fish camp Style place around. I only give it three stars because I've met the captain Steve and he's kind of a douche. Otherwise really good food. The salt and pepper flounder fillet is where it's at"}
{"text":"Mushy, tasteless, under-cooked food that is very expensive for what it is.

So, the reviews on this place seem good, but I think you need to approach this place cautiously.  We went tonight and I didn't want to get anything fried so I ordered the broiled flounder.  Came out and even looked odd.  Edges were crusty and too hard to eat and the rest of it was mushy and incredibly tasteless.  One person ordered a cheeseburger and the fries that came with it looked done, but were not cooked in the middle.  Tasted like frozen french fries that were cooked way too fast.  The server was nice, but the food is horrid.  The bill came and for three people it was $45 including tip.  I will NOT be going back here anytime soon, if ever."}
{"text":"Really fresh seafood price is reasonable and very large portions.   Seems like a winning combo if you like fried seafood!  Place is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out due to good word of mouth around my husband's workplace. My husband is a big seafood fan, and we moved to Charlotte from Florida- so we were eager to find a decent seafood restaurant.

In terms of ambiance, it's a very large and somewhat noisy place. Decorations are sparse, limited to some painted wall murals and a few typical tidbits (fishing nets, etc hung here and there). I think the noise level displeased me more than the decor, but I'm not typically a snob about such things so that doesn't really factor into my rating.

The meal started fine- their hush puppies are wonderful, the salad was delicious (and huge!) and the clam chowder wasn't bad either. Unfortunately we hit a major snag when we got to the main course. My husband's meal arrived fine (albeit after a somewhat lengthy wait, though I was willing to overlook that given we went on a Friday night and the place was pretty crowded), but my meal was nowhere to be found- apparently it was sent to another table by mistake, so we had to sit for another 20 minutes waiting on my dinner to be remade while my husband's food got cold. When it finally did arrive, the fish itself was fine but over-seasoned (I ordered the grilled Mahi-mahi) but I'd completely lost my appetite and did not really enjoy it at all. The onion rings it came with were disappointing as well, and the few french fries I stole off my husband's plate while we waited were not very good either- rather soggy and bland.

I'd like to believe our poor experience was an anomaly based on the other reviews and the good things we'd heard about the place, but given the experience we had there I do not think we will be going back."}
{"text":"All you can eat crab legs Tuesday night.....loved it.
Arrived around 5, not crowded by any means.
Great waiter, had no problem bring us plate after plate.
We'll be going again!"}
{"text":"Not food related, but we parked at this restaurant after hours for a cross country race held down the street. There were no \"no parking signs\" and the restaurant was closed. When we returned to the parking lot, restaurant employees had blocked all exits and would only let us exit if we paid $10. I'm glad to pay for parking if you choose to charge, but don't lock me in your parking lot and hold me captive because you didn't decide to charge people until hours after they've parked there. I hope this is not a reflection of this businesses ethical practices to customers, employees and their vendors."}
{"text":"I love coming here with family and eating seafood without having to go to the beach or some where else. I can trust this place with what they served. They grow there own vegetables. They have amazing sweet tea. Gets very very busy on the weekends. I would do a call ahead if you want to eat at home.
 The catfish and other fish is evenly salted and peppered. They prepare the food like they would at an elegant restaurant. I always get the salmon. It peels right off and is very juicy. The hush puppy's are very good and they give you a lot when you eat. 

Enjoy this place with your family"}
{"text":"Great seafood hours from the coast! Very friendly staff and nice nautical theme. Restaurant large enough to handle busy crowds, but still has a family owned feel. Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here at 4:45p on a Sunday. Quiet. Comfortable atmosphere. Staff was polite and attentive.

Great hush puppies! They were fresh - perfectly squishy on the inside and a good crisp on the outside. 

We started with a blooming onion. Very tasty. I liked the seasoning. It had a ever-so-slight kick to it - as well as the dipping sauce - it was really good! 

Side salad was good 

I ordered baby shrimp and a side of fries - the small seafood platter is plenty for a single person. It also comes with a small cup of coleslaw. You could probably share this platter with someone. I took half of it home in a to-go box. 

The hubby got catfish strips with a side of fries. It also came with a small cup of coleslaw. He got it with some salt and pepper in the batter and it came fresh out of the fryer. It was really good with the salt and pepper! 

I hear it can get pretty busy here, so coming 4:30ish on a Sunday was a good time."}
{"text":"Since Captain's Galley in Matthews  is closed for remodeling, I went to Captain Steve's in Matthews and this is absolutely the worst seafood I have ever had!  The selection is very limited and they don't have senior platters like Captain's Galley. They offer small plates, but don't have jumbo shrimp as a selection.  I paid $15.00 for the regular order of jumbo shrimp and the shrimp was greasy and the table wasn't even wiped clean when we sat down.  The flounder was thin and portions small.  It is extremely expensive too.  I will wait until Captain's Galley in Matthews to reopen to get  wonderful seafood!"}
{"text":"One step above McDonalds Fish.. If you like fried seafood that all tastes the same and dripping with grease this is the place for you. The inside is rather nasty looking and the enviornment is loud! Not recommended unless you like big portions of fried fish mush."}
{"text":"5 Star food and service.  This place is awesome!  I see people complaining about its loud, noisy etc, The place seats around 500 people and most nights it is packed!  Why = because the seafood is the best anywhere around here!  With 2 people no wait, 5 people or more you will wait.  But once you sit down, its ordering and coming fast!"}
{"text":"Good, fast service! Found the food to be hit or miss. I usually order the fried shrimp - it's delicious every time! Free hush puppies with honey butter while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"Best fried seafood in Charlotte - absolutely HUGE portions and fresh.  Free baby hushpuppies at the table and the best service around.  Get there early, or you will be in line forever.  If you like oysters, the fried oysters are great.  Don't forget they are closed on Sundays and Mondays..."}
{"text":"It's a fish camp.  Portions are generous, lots of fried stuff.  There is much to choose from on the huge menu.  The kids menu is a plus.  It covers just about anything a  youngster would want. I had Pete's combo; nice variety but way overcooked.  I expected some crunch but oysters were almost unrecognizable.  Food was well seasoned, just too much time in the fryer and too much time to get to the table left my  onion rings cold.

 I hadn't been inside for a while.  Obviously they have done some renovations/upgrades.  I like the new look.  We were there on a Thursday evening, not too crowded but busy(it's really close to Carowinds) so we were sat quickly in a comfortable booth.
There in is the issue.  At table 29 you have an unobstructed view of the servers' station.  No delicate way to say this but...lots of long haired servers standing, and hair flipping at the station directly in front of the open ice bin.  To their credit hair was technically restrained just not left untouched.  The worst transgression that transfixed me was no one EVER used the ice scoop.  Every beverage cup was dipped into the ice bin by every server hand that touched anything and everything in sight. The scoop was only used to fill pitchers.  I'm glad I always drink water, no ice, no lemon(these were plopped in by hand as well).  I don't think the intent was to gross me out but some re-training is needed asap.  

Will I return?  Probably not to this location and certainly not to dine in.  I'll stick with takeout or patronize the location on Monroe Rd. It's closer and service is very friendly and speedy."}
{"text":"Well this could be either a 4 or 5 star depending on what you expect. The term I was given when I moved here was \"fish camp\" and that's what it is. You want good fried fish and lots of it for the money come on. Large menu and all is good."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years, and have watched the quality go downhill for several years now. My wife and I just had dinner there, and it will be our last time. They put us in the back room where a group of 35 to 40 were having a birthday party. They were extremely loud and boisterous, we could not carry on a conversation across the table. The service was slow, and the quality of the food was poor. The acoustics in this place are on a par to a rented mini-storage unit, low ceilings and no attempt to moderate the noise level. We complained to the manager, who apologized and said we should have asked to be moved. I replied that we should have been asked if we minded being in the middle of a loud birthday celebration, but this was lost on her, won't be a problem again. If you like mediocre food and lousy ambiance then this is the place for you. If you actually want to talk to your dinner companion and have an enjoyable dining experience then look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Drove in from Mississippi to enjoy Charlotte N.C. with Family.  Stayed in Ballantyne and stopped of at your restaraunt for a meal.  LOVED IT!  Your staff was GREAT and the Food beat our expectations.  Had the Flounder & Shrimp fried.  It was so much that we went out and bought some tupperware to take the rest home with us.  We were broken hearted as we got half way home and questioned each other on who got the food out of the refrigerator......OH WELL!  It is far better to have eaten at Captain Steve's and lost....than to have never eaten there at all!!!"}
{"text":"Everything tastes exactly the same. The most popular item(s) on the menu is the combination platters. They have several options and you can pick 2, pick 3, etc. All come with french fries and hush puppies. I like my variety and the ability to choose, but in the end, it doesn't really matter. No matter what you order it all tastes exactly the same; which is deep fried, greasy bread crumbs. The fish is tasteless, the chicken is tasteless, the shrimp is tasteless, everything on your plate including the fries and hush puppies taste the same.

The inside is extremely noisy and bland. It looks like your sitting on the inside of a elementary school gym. When you open the front door you're immediately standing in a line as if you're getting onto an amusement park ride or you're going through security at the airport. When you're finished with your meal, it's back in the line again at the front to pay.

The staff is extremely unpleasant. Since they have a \"shared waiter / waitress\" system they are not working for tips so they can care less about being nice or helpful. 

to sum it all up: Quantity over Quality.

If you're in the mood for deep fried bread crumbs and don't want to talk to anybody and want to be forced out of your seat in 20 minutes.....then you'll love Captain Steve's. Honestly, save yourself the money and the headache of being herded like cattle and go to Captain D's. If you're like me and think Captain D's is disgusting then you'll definitely not enjoy Captain Steve's.

After going 3 times I'm calling for mutiny"}
{"text":"Ordered a small flounder plate today.  There was more fish in a McDonald's filet-o-fish sandwich and for much less.  I got two flat tail pieces one with skin and the other without.  Not sure if I'll come back.  It seems strange to see it empty at dinner time."}
{"text":"We just moved to Harrisburg so we thought we would try this place out. It is usually crowed when we have drove by so we thought it must be pretty good. Well it's not. The flounder was fishy and had a very strong taste to it. Our children love fried baby shrimp and they wouldn't eat their food. We ended up throwing our food away that night and all ate cereal. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Our family goes here at least 3-4 times a month. The service is great and the seafood rocks. Get one platter and share it.. they pile so much on a plate its enough for two and not expensive. LOVE them!"}
{"text":"I do not know how this place has such a great review.  I had the crab cakes and it was over priced and was so oily I could barely eat it.  My husband said the same about his food.  Our server was really nice but that was the only good thing I would say about this place."}
{"text":"We had a GREAT experience here. Coming from coastal VA it has been difficult trying to find a seafood restaurant that reminded me of home, until we ate here. Seafood is fresh and that has been hard to find. Our meals came out hot & fast. Our waiter was exceptional. It is also great to see a staff that works so well together.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good seafood better than a lot of places good tilapia good crab legs great salads, very good place to take food to go it's always crowded, just not the best seafood I've had that's why I have 4 stars. Plus they just steam your crab legs and no seasoning not even old bay but the quality of crab legs are still good. Will go again"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate in; the service was fast, the staff kind and the food great. You always get your value worth here. I have been to the Fort Mill and Monroe Rd. location but the Harrisburg beats them both. 
Have a good time if you devise to dine."}
{"text":"Super fast, family friendly and the food is great! Be aware that it can long wait time getting a table. But once in it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Love their food. Always eat way too much. Hush puppies are great!It is always busy but we don't mind the wait."}
{"text":"Get the fisher mans platter, bring a friend . Best lazy Sunday decision one can make, bar the fish market' s brunch"}
{"text":"Large portion of food. Staff friendly. All and all worth the visit. Would return a 2nd time."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The fried platters are very good. The service has been good too. We have talked to the owner and he is a very nice guy. If you're looking for a seafood place with great food this is your place. They have broiled healthy options but they pale compared to the fried options"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service is the worst. We live close by and hope that service will get better but it never does. Today we waited at least 5 min. for the waitress to come by and drop off hush puppies. Then waited another 10 or so min. for something to drink before choking on the hush puppies. Being an ex-waitress myself, a customers drink should not get below halfway and we were sitting on empty for quite some time about 3 times total. It was difficult to eat without anything to drink so by that time you just give up and are ready to leave. And of course you wait again to pay the bill so you can leave. I'm not sure if it's the waitresses fault or lack of staff. In addition, I definitely don't want you to smell like cigarettes when you return either when I've been sitting here waiting on you."}
{"text":"I have taken my family here twice for dinner and each time the experience was great.  We did not have to wait to be seated and the service was great.  The seafood was also very good.  We have eaten fried fish and broiled/blackened fish and scallops and all of them were cooked perfectly and tasted great.

The other reviewers who stated that the platters are huge are correct. The parking lot is large and appears pretty full most evenings but the restaurant seats a lot of people, so we have not had to wait yet to be seated."}
{"text":"Drove 1.5 hours to try what people on my husbands job had raved about.
SUPER LOUD. Couldn't have a conversation with my husband across the table...at all. Fried shrimp had no flavor. Potato was over cooked & dirty. The salt & pepper catfish was mushy, slimy & so so fishy tasting. Waitress was way too friendly with her calling the men baby & flirting.....so unprofessional. The hush puppies were the better part. We didn't finish our food.- won't be visiting again for sure."}
{"text":"Great Seafood..Great Service...Loud always....Food is always hot and and is fresh, which is important for seafood.

TRY THE greens as well..Great southern side."}
{"text":"Bad service I want be going back!! I think I'll stick with Mayflower much better service."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them half a star or less. Ordered AN 8 ounce sirloin and it was cooked well done after I ordered medium rare. Brown in the middle (big difference from warm red center). No big deal would've just sent it back without a fuss but the manager, Christine, saw it fit to bring it back to our table and tell us that we didn't know how to order a steak and try to argue that it was medium rare even though it was fully brown.  Ruined date night, we were so pissed to be treated like scum.  First time I've ever sent a steak back, not like we were trying to mess with them- I hadn't eaten off it, didn't even ask for a refund.  Still can't believe she brought it back to the table just to be a rude jerk.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"The best fish fry place in the Charlotte area. The portions are large and can be shared. Hush puppies come with most meals and they are awesome. On multiples visits I've tried the fried shrimp and fried fish. This is my favorite place to take people for fried seafood."}
{"text":"Extremely busy restaurant. They move you quickly so dont let that deter you. The food is very good. Great price point and large portions. This is not a fancy place but the service is great and the wait staff very friendly."}
{"text":"We were underwhelmed by this restaurant. The food was low quality and not fresh. I had a salad, sweet potato and \"grilled\" salmon. The salad was bland - ya know, iceberg lettuce and pale tomatoes. The sweet potato was slightly over done and the salmon was not grilled in the traditional sense. It wasn't smoked or charred. It was wet and a little fishy tasting. My husband had salad, clam chowder and a steak and shrimp combo with onion rings and a loaded baked potato. His salad toppings came on the side in separate little plastic to go containers and it was just as bland as mine. The clam chowder was way too thick...like pudding...and tasted canned. His steak was fair, the shrimp was a bit fishy, the onion rings were cheap and the loaded potato didn't come pre-loaded...they gave him all the toppings in little containers just like his salad. We were given bland hush puppies with pre-packaged containers of margarine. The food was more along the lines of heat-lamped fast food. I believe Red Lobster might taste better than Captain Steve's and trust me, I'm no Red Lobster fan."}
{"text":"My cousin and I ate here for dinner and we ordered from the large fried platter menu. I ordered the jumbo shrimp and claim strips with onion rings and hush puppies. She ordered the devil crab and jumbo shrimp with a baked potato. I didnt get a picture of her plate but it was a lot of food. We enjoyed our meals. I would have given them a 5 star this time but i took off points because it took the food just a little longer to get to us than usual but overall the food was great, the people working there were very nice and professional. I always enjoy myself everytime I have the chance when I'm home visiting. Prices are great for the amount of food they give which is alot!!;-)"}
{"text":"I'm fascinated by the long line to get into this place.  I felt like I was in a Twilight Zone episode.  Do you people not understand that the food here is terrible?  I would never eat here ever again.   It's awful.  And they don't serve alcohol!  Ugh!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. Very reasonable prices. The staff can get bogged down on weekends when whole dinning room is full so be patient good food is coming.

Lunch has nice 2 item combo for $6.95 comes with tea slaw hush puppies and choice of one side. I like the baby shrimp and Flounder combo."}
{"text":"On Wednesdays, during lunch hours, 2 kids eat free with one adult entree. The catfish is awesome (don't get salt and pepper unless you like your food REALLY salty) and all you can eat hush puppies are to die for!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was bright and clean. The place was packed. Portions were well sized. The hush puppies with honey were nice. We had 2 sides - coleslaw  and potato salad which were tasty.  I enjoyed the bbq platter. My husband got Steve's platter and felt it was too much breading. Our biggest concern was the condiments sit on the table all day. The seafood isn't real high end, but overall we had a nice meal."}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times since they opened. 
The grilled fish was great, and the sirloin steak, surprised how good it was! 
 fried catfish whole was tasty but tiny, we asked waitress before ordering and she told us it was medium sized, it was not. 
Their salad that comes with only about  half the entrees is very nice as well as the salad dressing. I had a grilled shrimp salad and it was very good with lots of shrimp. 

Overall we like this place and find it a welcome addition and not overpriced. I think the food is above average for this area. 
  I think the wait staff could use some improvement and a vegetable added to the menu would be good  Im sure they are still working out the kinks! 
Give it a try I think you will like it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a lot of food for the money this place is great as the portions are huge.  But unless you like the fried frozen variety of seafood you won't be satisfied.  The non-fried stuff I've ordered has been pretty blah.  Parking is a nightmare during prime times, as are the wait-times for a table, so go in off-hours for sure."}
{"text":"I had the filet of perch and fried oysters and man... They were great! Great portion size for 14 bucks. Even though I got fried it wasn't greasy. I got it to go but the place looked pretty cool to eat at! The fries and hush puppies were good. I will return."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time and had a great experience. It's always packed when I drive by.

Even though the parking lot is always full, we got a table right away with no waiting time. The service was great and I enjoyed the food. Their plates are big even if you get a small size one and I was still able to take half of it home.

Good amount of food for the price you're paying."}
{"text":"UN-EFFING BELIEVABLE!!!  Tuesday AYCE crab legs cooked to perfection.  Not even close to Chinese buffet caliber.  Worth every bit of $32.  They don't play any games so if you wanna eat they'll stuff you 'til you're full.  I had to ask them to stop bringing them, no joke.  The basket of tiny little hush puppies with honey butter were a pre-dinner dessert.  Best homemade Arnold Palmer ever!  I got there just after 5 and they were already busy and by the time I left around 6:30 they were super busy.  That many locals says something in itself.  Ask for Jessi, she was great!"}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my last review and it has been back to normal, Good service, good food. They have started offering daily lunch specials. Chicken and dumplings look really good. Haven't tried them as I'm addicted to fried shrimp and oysters."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait but well worth the wait.  GREAT!!! seafood place.  I love, love, love fried seafood.  Fried shrimp are usually my favorite but the salt and pepper catfish is terrific.  I will order just the catfish next time I come in ... which I hope is soon.  Great hushpuppies, received slaw but did not try it (just not a fan of coleslaw, except my own).  We went last week, it was threatening rain but the parking lot looked like Walmart at Christmas and 50+ people waiting at the front door.  Certainly worth the trip!  And oh yeah, they are great with their service!"}
{"text":"Unless you can seriously shovel some food in your mouth, I'd suggest splitting a meal.  I ordered the Alaskan Whitefish and got 5 (you read that right), 5 filets.  Accompanying my filets were a bunch of onion rings, hush puppies and slaw.  The prices are very fair and the service was great for a place that had over 100 (yes, you read that right too), 100 cars in the parking lot.  The food is what you'd expect from any fish camp, but the portions are ginormous.  The atmosphere is busy...very busy!

Try:  The Mahi

Avoid:  Ordering for kids (Let them eat off your plate)"}
{"text":"Meh.....mediocre I asked about the hush puppies and the waitress raved they were the best she'd ever had! So I ordered some. Just like everything else I ordered they were sub par"}
{"text":"Good for the money.   Hushpuppies were overcooked and fell apart but the shrimp was good.  Service was attentive.  The one drawback is that we were in the far left dinning room which has concrete floors and a wood ceiling which made it very very loud"}
{"text":"The seafood is great, service is prompt.  We have had fried, broiled and the shrimp salad.  They are able to efficiently handle large groups.  The only negative is the noise.  It can get pretty loud with a full house and it is usually a full house.  The food and extremely reasonable prices make up for the noise."}
{"text":"Just left this place. The hostess was rude to my bf when he asked if there was topping to go in his \"sweet potato mash\". She told him, \"This ain't Thanksgiving\". 

Anyway. The \"mac n cheese\"...was in no way, shape or form appetizing. Boiled elbows with that powdered, watery cheese. My hushpuppies were cold and hard, and my shrimp were cold and mushy. The breading would fall off as I went to pick it up. Oh! And I ordered a combo, & was given ONE piece of fish as opposed to my bf's 2. 

I have eaten at the Harrisburg location. Runs circles around this place. Don't waste your time. I surely won't."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere and giant food portions. Food taste great and service was nice. Food came out quick and easy."}
{"text":"I've eaten there several times.  The food is always very good and you get plenty for a good price.  The sweet tea is also very good and the hush puppies are some of the best I've eaten.  The waitresses are always very pleasant and efficient, even when the place is packed.  The seats are a bit uncomfortable but part of that could be due to my bad back!  Overall. it's a great, inexpensive place to eat!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish camp. Portions are very large even with the small ones. The food is amazing! There always super busy so be ready to wait especially on the weekends. We call in a lot to and the staff is always nice and very efficient."}
{"text":"We love Captain Steve's! If you are looking for great seafood, you have to come here. Even with the line out of the door waiting, it all worth it! My wife's parents are from Gastonia, a city with tons of fish camps. They would rather drive to Rock Hill, meet us and go to Captain Steve's! The food is always yummy! The staff is always friendly and take great care of their customers. With the new landscaping and paved parking lot, I don't have anything to complain about any more!"}
{"text":"This is like a higher priced long John silvers. Greasy fattening food, not so clean, it just shouts heart attack at the door. I had fried oysters and some sides but really would never go back. Greasy and sloppy."}
{"text":"I normally am a HUGE fan of Captain Steve's but the treatment we received today at the Fort Mill location from Manager Becky and employee Sue Ellen was horrific! We chose Captain Steve's to celebrate my sister earning her Bachelor Degree from college and thought that a Family restaurant would be the best place, unfortunately we were wrong. As our meal was ending our table of 16 people was approached by Becky and Sue Ellen where Becky proceeded to tell us that we were causing patrons to leave because we were loud. Hmmm, now we were sitting right at the kitchen as seen in the photo and I have never been to any Captain Steve's or any other family restaurant where you could hear a pin drop. If you have ever been to Captain Steve's it is not a quiet place there are large families all over the restaurant, conversations taking place, children playing or crying and laughter, none of these are whispering actions or scenarios.  Manager Becky was rude unprofessional and unkind to tell a family they were the cause of patrons leaving (which was untrue). Later we were told the patrons left because they were ready to go and that no patron reported leaving due to us. Several of the waitresses apologized profusely for Becky's inappropriate and unnecessary action.  We requested our checks ($300 plus) and left immediately.  Our family will not frequent another Captain Steve's. Collectively we spent well over $300 today just to be mistreated for no solidified reason.  While you hate to think it was a racially driven scenario it definitely crosses the mind. It crossed mine!! What a shame! #PinkIsLove  #FormerCaptStevesFan Video of the noise level posted."}
{"text":"Great fish house.  Loved it when I could eat fried food.  Better than most seafood houses at the Beach."}
{"text":"Went to Captain Steve's on Saturday, 3/7 for my friends daughters birthday. It was a large party of about 20 people. She called and they said to come at 6:00 pm. We arrived about 30 minutes early and we were seated on time. After received a group hymnal session and being blessed by the waitress we were pretty hyped. An hour later when our orders had not been taken our spirit began to deflate. Once the orders were taken, another hour passes and no food at all. Most restaurants wait until all of the food is prepared before bringing out the plates. So after waiting and hour, my husband asks what's the hold up and she says that it's the broiled plates that's holding everything up, really??? After about 15 more minutes I suggested to the actual waitress who was serving our table, in a very calm and cordial way I must add, if they could just start bringing out the plates as they were completed. She snapped and said  \"honey, y'all are not the only party here. We have 3 other parties that I have to take care of\". I was proud of myself and didn't snap back and instead told her that I understand, but we've been waiting over and hour for our food.

Meanwhile, all of the seats around us are being filled and they're eating!! I'm watching the carry out area and people are coming and going like crazy. We have children in our party and even the kids meals were not fulfilled. After being there for over 2 hours now, the father of the birthday girl approaches the Asst Manager, Mike and explains the situration. He says that he can't do anything and that he'll get the Manager. Do you think he ever moved from the hostess desk, nope. He stood in birds eye view of our talbe the entire night and never retrieved the manager. He was like a sack of potatoes that could not be moved.I asked the waitress again about our food and she says it'll be ready in 20 mins. We sat before 6:00 and now it's after 8:00pm. We should have just walked out, but by then it was too late to go somewhere on a Saturday night and be seated. We finally get our food and the broiled food that was supposedly holding up everything was not even hot. It's a fried food joint, it only takes about 15-20 to broil fish and even less time to fry it. What takes the cake is that it tasted like fish soaked in water. My husbands and I food was supposed to be blackened, instead it was sprinkled lightly with some type of seasoning that looked like paprika, but had absolutely no taste at all. All of the food finally trickled in except the kids meal. So a 5 year old was the only one still at the table waiting on a kids popcorn shrimp dish. The food was the worst seafood that I've ever had in my life. No one finished their meal. Then the other waitress comes back and sings another hymn, I guess to soften us up for the wait for the tickets. The nail in the coffin is that each ticket was of course charged a 15% gratuity and not one person came over in over 2  hours and 45 mins to apologize for the waiit or say thanks for being patient. My husband was right. He said when all of the singing started that they were softening us up for a bad experience. I guess with one waitress serving multiple tables, one bus girl and one food delivery person bringing out the plates, you can't expect much. 

So if you decide to try this restaurant anyway, just remember that I warned you. You'd better go in with low expectations or you'll be extremely disappointed. This place is a \"0\" star, but you have to give it a rating, so ergo the \"1\" rating."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times, both for lunch and for dinner.  Food is fresh, hot, huge portions.  Wait staff is attentive.  Only disappointmentn is lack of vegetables on the menu.  Would like to see something green on the menu, or even applesauce.  Wanted to substitute a small salad for a side, but was told I could not do that. Why not?"}
{"text":"After all the hype I figured we would try captain Steve's ...I must say it was OK at best nothing special as far as I'm concerned the steak was over cooked and the shrimp was average at best...no kidding this place is seriously loud ...kids ...kids and more screaming kids .... It's basically the chuckie cheese equivalent of pizza of the seafood world ...enough said I would recommend either chain ...bonefish or red lobster is way better ...just being honest I would never go there again"}
{"text":"The food is quite bland. Everything tastes the same as it is fried in the same oil I suppose. The flounder has random thin bones in it that'll spike you in the gums at random and the sweet tea is only passible as it tastes like its made in bulk batches."}
{"text":"This food was AMAZING!!! They even have Diet Coke! But, they do not have alcohol. If we could have given a 4.5 for not having cold beer wth seafood, we would have, but I just couldn't give this place less than 5 stars. The line outside shows this place doesn't need our review, but it was the second most favorite place we have been that had such amazing seafood, so we had to write something!! (Our favorite above all is Cabby Shack outside of Plymouth, MA.) I had fried scallops and shrimp. The scallops were perfectly cooked with just enough sweetness and batter to melt in your mouth. As an aside, my meal was only $14.95 for two choices, and i had to take food home; there was just no way to eat it all. I wanted to, but I couldn't. How can you beat that?? My husband had fried scallops, catfish and collard greens. He added a little malt vinegar to the greens and then fell into heaven!! His favorite collard greens were from a friend who lived in Louisiana and knew how to make collard greens. With just a little added malt vinegar, this place's greens were just as yummy. If you're in Charlotte and you want seafood, this place is a must!!  Don't let the line scare you. There are a lot of tables on the inside, and the line moved quickly. Come enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I go to a lot of fish camps and this  is definitely one of the best.  The service was great and the food was excellent.  Definitely worth a trip"}
{"text":"Large portions, good prices, friendly and efficient staff - this is the place for a good, very informal seafood meal.  Large menu variety with multiple cooking choices.  Kid welcoming and easily accommodating larger groups.  We'll be back. Did not see any outdoors seating accommodations . Lunch menu weekdays, but closed Mondays."}
{"text":"New to the area and not knowing a thing about Steve's, we stopped in for dinner because it looked local and it was busy.  

Upon entering, I made the mistake of asking the host what their specialty was.  He looked at me blankly and said, \"Uh, well....everything is fried\".  He wasn't kidding!!  Not that I'm complaining mind you.  There are a few non-fried items on the menu, but after eating a thousand yummy hushpuppies with that sinful honey butter, who's counting calories??

The entrees are standard fried seafood fare, so it's kind of hard to screw that up.  I think the Alaskan whitefish is especially yummy.  The catfish is not my favorite, as it is breaded differently than I am used to - meaning it doesn't have a cornmeal breading.  

Portions are enormous.  Like truly, comically, enormous.  Not knowing this, first trip, hubs and I each ordered a meal and one for each of our kiddos.  We took home FOUR to go boxes full of food.  FOUR!!!  Great place to just let kids eat off your plate or share a meal.  

Cons - this place is busy!  Since the restaurant is large, there always seem to be many large groups/parties and that can really slow service down.  It is also pretty noisy so if you prefer a quiet dining experience, Steve's is not for you.  Me, I have two small kids, so no sweat.  

Decor is completely kitchsy in a fun kind of way."}
{"text":"This used to be our \"go to\" place when my in laws came into town. We haven't been in awhile and it seems that the service has declined. We were a party of 7 (4 adults and 3 kids), so that put us in the \"gratuity\" included in bill category. We didn't have any special requests upon ordering. When our food arrived, my father in law's meal was missing. No big deal...we figured it was on its way. 10 minutes passed without our server stopping by to check to see if everything was good to go. So, we flagged her down to let her know we were missing a meal. She said that she'd go and check. She later came back to say the order was left off and she'd have to resubmit. Meanwhile, everyone else at the table was eating. No offer for an appetizer or side salad to at least give him something to have to eat. On her way to the kitchen, she stopped to check on several other tables. When his meal arrived, the rest of our party was just about finished eating and I had one child who had fallen asleep. My FIL commented that his fried scallops tasted \"off.\"  More on that in a moment. Server has now permanently disappeared. So, the bill comes and my husband asks if anything can be done about the delay and the bill. We were not looking for a free ride. The rest of our meals were fine. But, we felt that there needed to be some adjustment given that my FIL ate after the rest of us. It takes 15 minutes for the manager to come over and they offer 10% off...my FIL's meal. That was it. 

Fast forward to a few hours later and my FIL  became sick to his stomach me and was up all night. 

Maybe it was an off night. Maybe they had other tables who were more difficult. But, we will look for other options going forward."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Wayyyy too much food for lunch portions. I was pretty excited about the rice and gravy as well as the cabbage- both were just ok for side dishes. Nothing overly special. The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave ZERO stars! The female manager tried to blow smoke to cover for the lack of respect for the seafood industry and then literally walked away in the middle of our conversation without even finishing her sentence! We were appalled that after a 50 minute wait, our overly breaded dish (only 1 of 3) arrived, and we were told our order was given to another table. Our server was apologetic but it really was not her fault. We will not go back. When management doesn't even care, why should I spend my hard earned,money here? And don't get me started on the cursing from the manager .... So completely unprofessional."}
{"text":"The food was not bad, but it was not so good either. What made me give this restaurant 1 star is the attitudes of the staff. We came in with a party of 7 adults and 3 kids. 75% of the items we order, they did not have, and most of them we found out after a long wait. I waiter was initially nice, but I guess he got overwhelmed because he kept forgetting items we ordered, and the kitchen did not have it together. He told us they only had 2 cooks available for the night, and that was the problem. The spaghetti dish someone ordered was rancid, not only bad tasting, but completely sour and inedible. Completely rude and unprofessional staff. I would not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Captain Steve's and I was excited to try this restaurant, as it has received rave reviews from my friends whom I was visiting in Fort Mill from Miami.

When I we sat at the table, we were greeted with two basket fills of mini hush puppies accompanied by sweet butter sauce. It has been a while since I've had hush puppies and to my delight they were ta-sty! I chose grilled scallops as my entree, however had a nice sized bit of my friend's grilled Greek style flounder. Who knew that flounder topped with greek salad toppings would be so good. My scallops were grilled to perfection, with a little squeeze of fresh lemon. The baked potato was also cooked wonderfully and everything washed down well with the sweet tea.

The ambiance was great for a family dinner, but I wouldn't suggest it for a romantic night out due to the noise level. Also, be prepared to walk through gravel and dirt when you walk to the establishment, as the parking lot is not paved. 

Overall, this restaurant proves to be a great experience. So you want a wonderful seafood experience, you must check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite 'fish camp' ever!  Great food and great prices!

This place is always packed, and for good reason.  Don't let the crowds deter you--the lines move quickly.  Bring the kids, pop-pop and everybody else--I don't know anyone who doesn't love Captain Steve's.  It's a diverse, family friendly crowd.

Big glasses of sweet tea (or whatever you want, of course) and piles of hush puppies for everybody get us started.  There are numerous fried options on the menu, but also plenty of broiled and a few grilled choices too.  For many years, I ordered the grilled shrimp dinner (wayyyyy too many perfectly grilled and seasoned big shrimp, along with choice of fries or baked potato, and a really big and fresh side salad).  This was not on the menu but was sometimes a 'special;' but I learned that I could always get it if I just asked.  They're very accommodating when possible.  I think they may have added it to the menu.  It's my favorite.

One surprisingly good thing on the menu is their appetizer of raw oysters.  I love raw oysters, although I'll admit I'm no expert.  I forget the price of their oysters, but I remember that it's really cheap, and you get a whole bunch--I think we counted 2 dozen once.  They do not come on the half-shell.  They're served on a little plate with a bowl of cocktail sauce in the middle, along with crackers, horseradish and lemon.  My husband and I always pig out on these to start off.  

They do not serve alcohol, which is just fine.  I do drink, and I enjoy a drink/wine with or before my dinner; but it certainly isn't a requirement, and I don't miss it at this restaurant.

If you're looking for fine dining, keeping driving.  But if you want some nice, all-around good fish-camp fare, this is it.  It's a little loud, but it's all happy family noises--you can certainly carry on a conversation comfortably.  It's just not the place to go for a quiet, cozy, romantic dinner.

Captain Steve's also does take-out of (I think) anything on their menu.  We've done this several times, and it's always just as good and prompt as dining in."}
{"text":"The food was FANTASTIC!!!!!  We are from out of town and got a recommendation from a friend.  This place knocked it out of the park.  The hush puppies are amazing.  Our waitress recommended the grilled tuna and grilled wild caught salmon.  Our waitress was Dorey.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and prep.  I saw her assisting many tables with what to order.  She was cheerful and a great server.   Will surely eat here again and will try to have Dorey for our server.  Thank you sooooooo much!!!!!"}
{"text":"I brought a blind young man to Captain Steve's for lunch today, because he loves seafood! We were seated immediately and waited on quickly- not because of his disability, but because they clearly deliver quality service. Our server and others were very kind to him, speaking directly to him, which doesn't always happen. Our food came out as ordered and quickly. The food was hot, as were the appetizer hush puppies. Obviously the food had not been sitting around, but was made to order. I ordered grilled whitefish, which was seasoned very well. My friend loved his fried oysters! Our lunch at Captain Steve's was a very good experience, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came with both of my cousins for a mothers day dinner. Restaurant was busy but we only had a 5 min wait. The booth seats we sat at was sunken down on one side closest to the aisle, so I sat closer to the window. Service was ok and food was good. Homemade lemonade had a metallic taste, 2bd batch tasted better."}
{"text":"Just want to know if the location in Charlotte off Monroe road is not Capt. Steve's any longer. What a bummer if it is not---I hated going to Ft.Mill to eat there years ago even though we  liked the food , too far to travel. When they came to our area we were so happy. I am not about to drive 40 or 50 minutes to go to a restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been coming to \"Steve's \" for years now---even used to drive all the way to Ft.Mill to the other restaurant before they came to Charlotte off of Monroe road. Now, I don't usually have an issue with some other posters complaints and I do agree that sometimes, the service can be hit or miss . Some servers are great while others appear to be disinterested. By and large, it's a no frills place but you are coming for the food ---while both should be a great experience , it's the food that keeps me and my friends and family coming back here to eat.
 Portions are very generous and I have never left the place without taking some of my meal home. My son usually orders the mixed fried platter and your eyes just pop when you see it set down in front of you! He is 6ft. and 185 lbs and even he can't finish this. I usually order the grilled shrimp salad but I ask the server to substitute the jumbo fried shrimp which I gladly pay extra for as you get 8 or 9 of them and that is more than enough for me. Hush puppies are good too. I wish they would add a bit more horseradish to their cocktail sauce , though. I would have given a total of five stars in my review but like I stated, the service could be a bit more polished ---otherwise, it's a great place if you are wanting fresh seafood and lots of it."}
{"text":"I used to eat here a lot with my family when I was younger. I may not return after today. It took them at least five minutes for them to acknowledge that we were standing there to be seated (there wasn't a line). Our waitress was okay, even though the fries were horrible as if they were reheated from the day before. The perch was decent. They should really take notes from Captain Steve's in Fort Mill on the quality of food and customer service."}
{"text":"Hushpuppies were awesome. Huge servings of food. We were friendlier than the wait staff but that may be due to us arriving 1 hour before closing. Overall was a pretty good experience and I'll come back."}
{"text":"Delicious- but how can a restaurant that primarily serves fish if all kinds, NOT serve alcohol?  A fish platter without a beer?  C'mon that's taboo"}
{"text":"Review is primarily for takeout, haven't dined it yet.  
Who can argue with fried seafood?  One day out of the blue I got a craving for fried oysters.  Being homebound with a newborn my lovely husband went to pick up a couple of captain's platters - a generous heap of fried scallops, oysters, jumbo shrimp, little shrimp, fish, hush puppies and some deviled crab.  I ordered two platters for three hungry adults, plus three bowls of chowder, and there was enough food for dinner for all of us plus lunch for two of us the next day.
The amount of food is of course the star.  The fried oysters hit the spot for me, and I also really liked the deviled crab.  The only negative thing I would say is that the platter was definitely dominated by the little shrimp - I suppose it's the cheapest thing, but the plates were like 65% little shrimp.  Yeah it was good but I'd prefer more of the other stuff.  Eh, not a dealbreaker.  The chowder was kind of mediocre.
Not very expensive at all, especially considering the massive amount of food you get.  This might just be our standby local non-fancy seafood stop.
As of 2/26/12 their website is kaput but their menu can be found at allmenus.com."}
{"text":"Pretty good seafood....I had the grilled salmon salad and it was tasty....the salad was fresh and the salmon was seasoned well"}
{"text":"Worst service I've experienced in a very long time!!! Shrimp a bit soggy (undercooked)"}
{"text":"Pictures look way better than what it is. I ordered oyster stew and it came out and was nothing but warm buttered milk with oysters.  The food was greasy with no flavor. The service was VERY POOR. Everyone walking around as if they had an attitude. I left over 3/4 of my dinner on the plate. Oh 1 good thing is the sweet tea was good."}
{"text":"I had a fried platter, my husband had a grilled platter. We both also had salads that were fresh and very well put together.
Our food was excellent with pretty good portion sizes. The seafood was cooked perfectly and tasted great. 
The server was friendly and competent.
I have to say the atmosphere is a little off and it is loud, but the great food is worth it."}
{"text":"This has always been my family's go to seafood restaurant but maybe we've caught them in bad days. Food wasn't as good. During this visit the jumbo fried shrimp had a strong ammonia smell/ taste. The flounder was ok. Hush puppies were gray, as they always are. 
I mentioned to the manager the issue of the shrimp and he seemed like there was nothing wrong. He offered to replace those and I accepted. The second batch was good but I'll think twice before eating here again."}
{"text":"Calabash-style fish camp... sure it's not the best food in the world but it is an experience. I stick with the fish sandwich. Everything here is fried and it seems to draw quite a crowd. There is often a long wait at peak hours. I would suggest going early if you want to get in in a reasonable amount of time. My nephew loves the aquarium near the hostess podium. 

Good hush puppies.

It's an inexpensive southern experience. Why not? (High cholesterol is a good answer to that question- but other than that I mean)."}
{"text":"Nice size portions.  Perfectly fried fish, but scallops too soft,  good hush puppies served immediately.  Piping hot baked potatoes.  Place is busy and little loud, service rushed not personal or attentive.   Fish and oysters fresh,  lots of turnover as place is always busy.  Large dining rooms,  simple decoration if any.   Prices are average and lunch prices very affordable."}
{"text":"No ever again for 14.95
Catfish bland no salt or pepper, soggy oysters, soggy okra to be all fried and hush puppies with small cup slaw mind you dinner plate.
50 cent for extra sauce;  No utensil no napkins
It was stated when I walked back in for you have to ask for Togo utensils ... So I guess I suppose eat with my fingers ... live in area for 15 years and pass this place daily and I will continue to pass them."}
{"text":"The food is a little higher than Red Lobster. I ordered a Baked Potato but was told it would be an additional 20 minute wait. So I asked for a sweet potato instead. It was a $1 up charge. IMO, the shouldn't have charge me $1 for the sweet potato when they didn't have any regular baked potatoes ready. It still took an extra 10 minutes for the sweet potato and it came out over cooked. Our waitress was attentive, but I felt sorry for the other customers. Their waitress was constantly had her boyfriends table. She must have gone over to his table 15 times while we were there and he had already had his food served before we even sat down. She was very attentive to him, brought him out a baked potato, onion rings, rolls, etc to go with his meal. She must have filled the condiments at his table at least 3x while we were there.  When I went to the bathroom after we ate, the custodian was emptying the trash and cursing up a storm with the hostess. She saw me and they both just laughed. Neither one of them apologized for their language or for me having to wait to use the restroom. Now I am all for a clean bathroom, but I shouldn't have to listen to young adults cuss up a storm while I wait. There was no manger on site. Seems the restaurant is run by teens and young adults."}
{"text":"Best fried seafood place ever! I have been there 3 times and have never been disappointed, good service, excellent food, and excellent atmosphere. We get the large platter and it comes with lots of food. You'll always be taking left overs home. Very good prices for what you get.  There is a cat that usually hangs around in the parking lot that will come find you when you leave for some food. Very busy place but you'll always get a seat really fast. Well worth the price the food the everything about this place! It is a must go when your in the area or even to take a drive and go. Captain Steve's is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I don't mind having some good southern fried seafood once in a while! 

This is my 2nd time here. I ordered the fried baby shrimp with flounder combo and a backed potato. The portion was big and the shrimp was fresh. The flounder was a bit greasy but that's what you get when you order it fried! The service was a bit slow the 2nd time but overall this is a good place to have some southern seafood once in a while."}
{"text":"Great fish amp hush puppies are excellent and platters  are more than anyone normal could possibly  eat . Great place for kids as they have a candy bar ."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the lunch specials and quick service. The price for 3 seafood items and a side can't be beat. During lunch time this place is bustling with people, but the service was not lacking. A bit loud, but that's just the atmosphere...down home and friendly. The fried oysters were tasty and will be my go to item."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just feel like a big plate of fried seafood.  We've driven past Captain Steve's on several occasions and always saw a full parking lot.  A friend of mine went there, and told me it was pretty good and that they offered huge portions for the prices.  

It was a Friday night and, in the mood for seafood, we finally decided to give the Captain a try.  We got there around 6:30 p.m. and, thankfully, didn't have to wait to be seated, despite the almost full parking lot.  Had we gotten there a bit later, though, there was a definite wait on a Friday night.  

The interior was well-themed and, since it looks like the building used to be a giant rollerskating rink, was much nicer inside (with a lot of dividing walls) than I had anticipated.  

Instead of bread, we were brought a basket of round hushpuppies as a little appetizer.  Wow.  They were the best hushpuppies I've ever had; not dry at all, and if they were, the honey butter accompanying them would have made them slide down easy. :-)

The menu was pretty full.  They had a lot of \"basic\" fried and broiled seafood options, including combination plates.  I hadn't had fried clams in a long time and had a craving for them.  I ordered the large portion since it was only about 75 cents more than the small.  What a large portion it was.  It was a definite mound of fried clams for only $8.50 or so -- plus a side item.  I brought about half of the clam strips home, although I'm not quite sure if we'll eat them.  Reheated fried clams doesn't sound all that appetizing.

Next time I'm going to try something broiled.  Although tasty, all of that fried food made me very sleepy...at around 8:00 pm on a Friday night."}
{"text":"The food was delicious all they need to do is expand the sides, where is the Mac and cheese?????"}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight at one of our favorite Seafood restaurants as well as fab location. Had a large party of 25. Unable to make reservations on a Sat. Peter Restaurant advises that he'd do the best he could to seat us quickly. Provide two waitresses who emerge prompt and very patient with included kids in our party as well. Food was great and received it very-fast . Great staff great fellowship and great food."}
{"text":"The food is adequate.  The service was horrible.  Asked for unsweetened tea was served sweet.  Took 15 minutes to find some unsweetened.  Ask for Splenda and they were out.  Husband was missing part of his meal.  When we spoke to the young man about everything he went to the owner and the owner said we would have to take it up with the server.  Never said sorry or offered any kind of discount.  Never again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Captain Steve's and I was very impressed! 

Whew! This place stays rocking!! I loved it!!! It's a very laid back atmosphere with tons of people and lots of food! Before my friend and I even sat down my mouth was watering just seeing the plates coming out the kitchen. 

Once we were seated, our waitress appeared with that delicious basket of hush puppies and honey butter....simply delicious! They were bite size pieces so you could just dip them in the butter and pop them in your mouth and before you know it the entire basket is empty. Great way to start the meal! 

For dinner, we both chose the salt and pepper catfish tenders which comes with french fries, cole slaw and more of those yummy hush puppies. 

Ok, so seriously it's been said in all the previous reviews but I have to agree portion size here should never be a problem for anyone. These plates come out STACKED with food. So trust me, you will need a to go box.  

The catfish was delicious. It was hot when it came out and seasoned really well. I liked that it was not just skinny tenders strips but l huge cuts of catfish battered and fried...just right! The fries and slaw were very tasty as well. Overall, it was a really tasty meal. 

The price was right, the service was great and the food was delicious. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"We had a ladie's group of about fifty or so for lunch and the service was great or food was abundant and tasty and we had our own private room! The lunch portions are HUGE! I had fried baby shrimp and my leftovers looked like more than I ate! I loved the hushpuppies and the tartar sauce was delicious (and I am finicky about mine)

Our waitress was awesome and I thought she handled our table of eight superbly! The only \" complaint\" was that our bill was done by the table and we had to split it at the cashier prompting us all to leave at once or return the ticket to the others. Not a huge deal but a tad inconvenient."}
{"text":"We should have turned and walked out when there was confusion about what was going on when we first walked in.  From there we were seated only to wait 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us.  Service did not get better from there. When the food was brought to the table the girl handed a hot plate to my friend. A surprised sound came out and she looked at him and said \"don't be a wuss\". My food came swimming in the water it was boiled in. The other plate with fried shrimp and flounder was cold.  No one came back to check on us We had to flag down someone else to have our check brought tot the table. I could go in to further details but let's just say that over all it was close to the top of the bad experience list and we have had quite a few.  To be honest I would put it a #3.

In general I would not recommend anything about this place. Even the water was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Have heard about this place. Seen the full parking lots on Fri & Sat. Met the owners one night, assisting another driver... And finally had a chance to have lunch! And was it worth it!!! From the small hushpuppies, the just right sweet tea, and topped it off w/the salt & pepper catfish fillets. Just the right amount to make it's mark for lunch. I can only imagine what dinner would be like!"}
{"text":"I am being generous because of the full perspective. Service is really good, super quick, sweet tea is good, side salad is large and was very tasty as well.......I was impressed and very happy at this point. Then the whole catfish plate arrived, at first glance there was a toon of food; there were eight yes that's right EIGHT catfish on the plate. I stopped before trying the last two fish because they were the smallest ones and the previous one was so small all I was able the get off of it was some fins and batter. None of the fish were longer than my fork, the last two laying in my hand beside each other left palm and some fingers visible. If the fish are that small take it off the menu, I gave three stars because I saw other plates with ample food and feel I just picked the whole catfish at a bad time. I will definitely be back to try something else, the place was packed."}
{"text":"Everything I said in 2010 still holds true.  I dare you to find a better seafood restaurant (fish camp) even in an ocean town.  Hushpuppies with honey butter - YUM!  One night they have all you can eat crab legs.  Or you get half an order for around $14 anytime.  That is my new fave - half order with clam chowder.  What are you still sitting there for?  If it's not Sunday or Monday - GO!  GO!"}
{"text":"All Captain Steve's are not created equal.  Charlotte looks the same but it most certainly is not.  The hushpuppies were pretty much the same.  They ran out of crabmeat on a Tuesday night so my sister couldn't have stuffed flounder.  She said the flounder was ok.  My tradition at Fort Mill Captain Steve's is clam chowder and a half order or crab legs.  New England Clam Chowder should be white.  They added carrots and sprinkled it with Paprika.  No.  Terrible IMHO.  My crab legs were over cooked and looked terrible.  The meat crumbled.  I have never had that happen anywhere but I had already returned the chowder.  And here is the absolute worst - They gave me margarine to dip the crab in.  Flavorless yellow Jell-o goop.  I'd rather use movie theatre \"butter\" than margarine.  Shape up Charlotte Captain Steve's!  And for the general public choosing, I highly recommend Fort Mill. Highly."}
{"text":"I wish they offered edible options that aren't fried. Would love a great seafood place that was local."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have been here, but the crab legs were always fantastic. Family friendly restaurant with the best service. The complimentary hushpuppies are delicous and fresh. 

If you want good home cooking and delish seafood or fish, I will always recommend this place!"}
{"text":"For me personally I thought the food was OK. My husband loved it and my mom liked it.  
It was a little loud and busy, a good place you can take the kids and not feel like your causing a scene. They loved looking at the fish tank in the front, it was a welcomed distraction. 
Our waitress seemed to be a bit confused all the time but our food was correct so I won't complain. 
The lighting in the entire restaurant was way too dim, this isn't a candle dinner date night type of place. I hated that it was too dark. We would definitely come again but I can't see it being a regular place for us."}
{"text":"My family tried Captain Steve's a few months ago and have been several times since. Service, food, portions and prices are good."}
{"text":"The food is real bad. Actually I didn't realize that the fish I ate was no good and became very sick from it. Also don't get the oyster soup I took one lick and sent it back. It's like eating watered down butter with oysters incorporated into it. Highly highly highly recommend CAPTAIN D's ;)"}
{"text":"First time.  You get started with a bowl of hush puppies - next time I won't eat any.  They are good, but there's no sense filling up on those.  Ordered a broiled seafood platter - it was very reasonably priced and we could have shared it and been done.  Flounder, Oysters, Shrimp two ways, Scallops and more.  Instead, we also ordered clam strips.  In the end, we brought quite a bit home.  In any case, the food was prepared just right.  
On the downside, the affordability seems to bring out the K-Mart crowd.  Additionally, the ambiance is lacking in pretty much every way.  This place could do with a bit of a decor overhaul, along with some healthier prep on the menu (most everything is deep fried) and an updated beer menu."}
{"text":"RUN LIKE HELL!!! New to the area and I have heard so many people talk about Captains Steve's and how great it is so this past weekend I decided to try it out. I was really excited! We went on Saturday around 2pm for lunch. Wasn't a lot of people there so I thought perfect. This would be the perfect time to spend some time with my family, relax, and enjoy lunch. Walked in and never received a greeting welcoming us to the place. We had received dinner menus so as soon as I sat down I asked for the lunch menu was informed that they do not use the lunch menus on the weekend. Ok no big deal. Our waitress Kristen was the absolute worst!!! She had a horrible attitude! Never smiled and came across like we were bothering her whenever we asked for something or when we asked her to come back because we were still reviewing the menu. She failed to refill our water glasses and when we finally brought it to her attention she poured water all over our table and did not even offer to clean it up. Horrible customer service experience!! The food was just ok. Wasn't seasoned very well. Overall I was not impressed and will not be back!!!!! 

**After talking with a few people about my experience. I learned that Captain Steve used to own this location on Monroe but it was bought out a few years back and they kept the name. not the same owners as the one in Harrisburg or Fort Mill. I'll try Captain Steve's again but it will NEVER be the one on Monroe.**"}
{"text":"It is not often that I am in the mood for a fishcamp but my grandparents love this place, so we gathered up the whole family to take my Grandfather there for a birthday celebration. 

I was pleasantly suprised to find that this place is so much better than the fishcamps that my family took me to when I was growing up. 

This place sure packs them in for dinner on the weekend, so be prepared for a wait if you go during \"prime-time\".   They are not open on Sunday or Monday, so keep that in mind if you're planning a visit. 

As with traditional southern fishcamps, your choice of beverages is pretty limited. Sweet tea is the house \"wine\". The hushpuppies with honey-butter are addictive, so be sure to save room for your meal! 

The food is plentiful and good.  If you are not in the mood for fried food, they have a decent selection of broiled options. I went for the broiled whole flounder platter with a baked potato & side salad ($16.95).  

If you're looking for good old fashioned southern fishcamp fare, this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Waitress started out very friendly but once we ordered and the food came out she disappeared. And I mean for good. She never came back, we had to grab another waitress to get our check and cash us out. And she never apologized or anything. My husbands broiled fishermans platter was decent but my food was terrible. I ordered the Steves fried combo but received the fishermans fried combo which was even bigger. The baby shrimp had a funny taste to them, the fried scallops were undercooked and the fried oysters and large shrimp were okay. I ordered the Mac and cheese as a side. Disgusting, it tasted like the dollar store off brand boxed Mac and cheese. The only delicious thing there was the hush puppies and the she crab soup I ordered for an appetizer. We waited 25 minutes before my husband got pissed and got up and got us to go boxes for our selves and when he did that then another waitress finally noticed us. Mind you there were only 2 other tables sat in the dining room with 4 other waitresses so they weren't \"busy\" like AT ALL. To say I'm extremely disappointed and will never go back to this place is an understatement. Do not waste your time or money on this place."}
{"text":"When you are craving tartar sauce, sweet tea and everything fried, try Capt. Steve's on Monroe Road.  On my first visit, my husband and I had grilled tuna steak.  It was plain, but fresh.  We saw mounds of fried seafood coming out of the kitchen.  Needless to say, we do not go there with eating healthy on our minds anymore.  It is Deluxe Seafood Platter all the way!!

They serve heaping portions of fried seafood, when it comes out of the kitchen it is consistently too hot to eat.  Isn't that what counts whilst eating fried food?  I think new owners took over, but the food was still the same on my last visit.  Great place to take out of town guest for a local experience.  I put my name in the fish bowl for a free lunch and they called me, I need to go this week!!

 I am going to rate it 4 corndogs."}
{"text":"I wanted seafood and saw the other reviews and decided to give it a try.

The hush puppies are worth the trip. They came out warm and yummy. Our waitress was also very nice. She was so excited about us eating there for the first time and recommended that we get whatever we wanted fried.

Well, I guess we should've eaten the fried food because the grilled option wasn't good. It was just ok. I had the stuffed flounder. He had the shrimp and scallops but they were tasteless.

Seriously, this place reminded me of a glorified Red Lobster, but not as good. And I don't think RL is spectacular, if I want great seafood, I go to great seafood restaurants. You get what you pay for I suppose."}
{"text":"Seafood. If your one of those guys, like me, who would rather have a buffet of some decent food over a barely half-filled plate of some fancy schmancy stuff, you may not want to go to a seafood joint that's landlocked. I mean, let's be honest, a seafood buffet is where it's at, and to find one it can be somewhat difficult in the Charlotte area. However, at Steve's, there are some damn filling portions of decent food if I must say so myself. Seems they pride themselves on their deep fried dishes, but that was expected. They also have healthier seafood options.

Service was great. Waitress was very attentive to the needs of our table. Venue is fairly loud, décor-wise, but adds to the feeling of being down at the beach. And what can be better than that?"}
{"text":"Not bad for a local fish fry.  I had Steve's platter and the portion was plenty for each item.  The wife had a two item combo and had more oysters than anyone could assume in one setting.  The kids enjoyed the kid menu items.  We had about a 25 min wait that was not expect, but went fairly quickly as they moved consumers in and out quickly."}
{"text":"In south Charlotte for a meeting and had looked up a restaurant...turned out to be closed.....sooooo, it was off to YELP for help.

Cap'n Steve's showed up on the radar.   It was just over the border and seemed to have decent reviews so I headed down.   The place was packed on this Thursday night but they had me seated in short order and I had a basket of hush puppies on my table before I could actually settle.  These little mini pups were tasty (I've had better....by my own hand) but a pleasant surprise for free.  The waitress was friendly and quick despite the crowd.

Food runner was out before I could even take in the atmosphere.. .. before me he sat a massive plate of fried goodness (including even more mini pups).  Shrimp were large and plump, scallops were tender and oysters were smooth.

I never had to wait for refills and it's always nice when a managerial type stops by to check on your experience.

Overall a good value, fast & friendly service and well worth the drive."}
{"text":"The prime rib was Awesome! and  my T bone was good. The service was good and John the owner came out to meet us and brought me and my brother a sample of the BBQ Ribs. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this restaurant for years now. If you love seafood as I do, Captain Steve's should be a great seafood place for you. As mentioned in other reviews her, you will be needing a to-go box as the servings are HUGE! Although the majority of the dishes are fried, Captain Steve's also offer broiled options as well. My favorite is the salt and peppered fried cat fish nuggets which are real catfish chunks cooked to perfection. Captain Steve's is one of the very few restaurants who can fry perfect flounder perfectly due to is fragility. The butterfly shrimp is good too and really plump. They give you tons of popcorn shrimp with each entree. If you love onion rings, these are the best! But most of all, what you will immediately notice is how fresh the seafood tastes. If you've ever eaten at a seafood restaurant near the ocean, then you know that fresh taste I speak of. Captain Steve's seafood is comparable to coast seafood restaurants. And this is the main reason why I keep returning and taking friends ind in town visitors. No one I've take has been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"I was craving seafood and Captain Steve's had many good Yelp reviews.  I was not disappointed.  I placed an order to go, and chose a combination of fried clams and fish.  I love fried clams and those hit the spot especially since I have not had any in years.  The fish was seasoned well and cooked to golden perfection.  I could not have been happier.  The portion size was good and I had enough to eat the next day.  

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Eeeeeehhhhhh, not too exciting. My boyfriend likes it but I am not too fond. And our last server wasn't too fantastic."}
{"text":"I was not at all impressed by this restaurant. The food was bland, the service was nothing special, and the atmosphere was terrible. 

The \"small\" seafood plate had more food than you'd ever imagine, if only they would switch from a quantity to a quality emphasis. The shrimp and onion rings had little to no taste and it was obvious that they weren't prepared fresh to order but instead were being kept lukewarm in the kitchen. My sweet tea tasted like it was made with warm hose water, and the hush puppies were subpar. None of the food was presented especially well, really it was all just thrown together. 

When it comes to the atmosphere, it's strange. The whole restaurant is dark, and has a very dated feel. Also, I found it odd that the busboy was hovering near my table. It was absolutely creepy. It was almost like he was staring, which simply made we want to get out- ASAP. 

I do not recommend this establishment, despite really wanting to enjoy it. There are very few seafood restaurants in or around Harrisburg, and it's a shame that this one is cannot meet even low expectations."}
{"text":"3 stars for the insane amount of food they pile onto your plate. I had the Steve's Fisherman, which was fried baby shrimp, fried jumbo shrimp, fried oysters, fried scallops, fried cod, a stuffed crab, and hush puppies. I think I finished about a quarter of my plate. Taking home leftovers was probably my favorite part.

But the amount of shrimp they piled onto our plate was serious. Even had my girlfriend screaming, \"You're eating a whole generation of shrimp!\"

Suggestion: stick with the broiled platters. Those who ordered it devoured the plates lickity split."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised about this place. Portions are huge so make sure you are really hungry when you go. Prices are really reasonable as well. Hushpuppies are the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the amount of food that I received. We had about 6 people with us and all of us had a lot of food on our plate. We had to take a to go box. They were very fast with bringing our food and also our drinks. It was crowded but it just means they are very popular. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a mess-a-fried seafood and I do mean a big mess! Portions are huge so unless you're looking for the biggest meal of your life, order the 1/2 portion. A 3.5 would be a more apt score but well... That's not an option.

Pros: consistently good. It's not GREAT seafood. It's good. Everything I've had fried has been good. My fave by far is the fried clams and I order them often. Carry out is quick and orders are always right. Inside dining we've always had quick, prompt and friendly service. Definitely kid friendly.

Cons: broiled options aren't very tasty. Would like more options for sides Like mashed potatoes, veggies, etc. also a sub for hush puppies ( for us no onion eaters) like cornbread, roll, or biscuit.

They roll through the people by keeping the menu consistent, which is fine - there are plenty of options. A place I visit often and enjoy."}
{"text":"After driving past this place for years we finally read some YELP reviews and decided there were enough good reviews to check it out for ourselves. 
So let's start with the line at the door .... usually great indicator that it's got something worth waiting for ...  and yes we got in line and it moved really fast for a Sunday night at 5:00 !
We were in a seat less than 5 minutes upon arrival ! 
Greeted immediately by a waitress eager to get our drink orders and followed up with a basketful of piping hot hush puppies delivered to our table along side our drinks . 
The menu had lots of choices and tonight's dinner for us was a Grilled Tuna with a sweet potato and dinner salad . I chose the jumbo shrimp with baked potato and coleslaw. 
The wait time for our food was less than 15 minutes. Seriously I could not get over how fast it all happened! 
The food was delicious, the service was outstanding and we were full with leftovers!
Why it took me so long to discover this fish camp I can't say .... but know this we will be back ! 
It was so good !"}
{"text":"This restaurant was okay.  I wish they would turn down the 1,000 watt lights so you could relax while having dinner!  The decor is \"interesting\" and definitely needs updating, however it is whimsical in a way. The lights ruin the entire experience.

The food was decent but not great.  My husband tried Grouper fish for the first time.  It was so fishy that he could barely eat it.  The server told us that was the type of fish it was, after he ordered and complained about the fishiness.  No \"fresh\" fish should ever taste or smell fishy.  

On a positive note, I had the shrimp skewers that were very good and so was the fried okra.  The server was very nice and went on and on about how great the food was.  

Again, it was okay but due to the extremely bright lights, loud decor and fishy fish, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service from Diana!!  The food was hot, fresh and plentiful and so delicious and you get so much for the money.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Eek. The one in Fort Mill is way better than this establishment. My understanding is it's the same name but not owned by Steve (like the one in Fort Mill, SC). 

It was empty during dinner time on a Thursday night. That should've provided all I needed to know . But, I entered looking for some tasty fish. 

It was a lukewarm welcome from the employees up front. The waitress was very cordial but the atmosphere was still that lukewarm. Just not a good feel. The restaurant as was the parking lot was not crowded.  I ordered catfish, fries and slaw. I got some hush puppies and they were average and nothing to write home about (oops am I doing that now?). 
Although, that was the best part of the meal. Catfish was falling apart and bland. The fries were decent.. just decent. The slaw was too creamy drowned in mayonnaise. 

I'll stick with the Fort Mill location.."}
{"text":"We came here on Sunday, right as the doors opened. I will say that's the perfect time because it wasn't very loud and service was great. This was my first time coming here, but my dad has been here before and said it was worth the drive from hickory nc. 

My mom and dad ordered the same thing, some platter, I forgot the name. My husband ordered fried scallops and fried baby shrimp. I ordered boiled shrimp and deviled crab on  the small plates menu . We all agree it was some of the best seafood you can get if you are not near an ocean! Everything was fresh and piping hot. I gave my husband a deviled crab for some of his scallops. We all agreed that these were some of the best scallops we've ever tasted! I highly recommend the scallops. 

The portion sizes are huge. Regardless if you order a platter or a small plate you will not leave hungry and that is a Fact! If you are in the mood for seafood i would recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"Visited Captain Steve ' s for the first time today.  There were 11 in our party. Our servers were great. They had 2 large parties at the same time.  But we NEVER felt neglected. 
Our food came to our table at one and it was all HOT! 
Everyone received the correct food, our drinks were maintained full, and the amount of food was generous. 
We order fish, shrimp, broiled items, & steaks. Smiles all around.  
I WILL return whenever I visit the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"A nearby restaurant that caters to my wife, a great seafood afficiondo. All well and good, if a little greasy, yet their alternates (burgers, other \"non-seafood\" offerings) were passable. This was surprising to me, as diners known for seafood have a tendency to bring that taste to everything coming out of their kitchen.

Oddly \"Mom & Pops\" feel, however, that has thrown my family off; they shut down the diner during the beginning of July for vacations. They won't re-open until July 16, or around there. Which seems...very odd, for a diner to do. Not to state that it is either good or bad, as far as the vacation, just surprising.

Good seafood, decent alternates, weird diner. Tremendously popular in the local area."}
{"text":"Captain Steve's has a long history in the Charlotte area and as a result is very popular with the locals.  This location was my first experience with the well loved fish camp and I have been here several times since they opened a few years ago.  As soon as you sit down they will bring you a basket of hush puppies with honey butter.....enjoy.  I try to stick with the same entree with a few modifications.  I usually go with the fried or blackened fish combo with blackened scallops, a salad, and the collard greens.  The greens are not fresh, probably frozen but they are seasoned really well and are my favorite side here.  The blackened fish and scallops are really good, not heavy like the fried.  This is a very spacious location and is usually always crowded."}
{"text":"Rude and hateful.  That is how I describe the manager and owner of Captain  Steve's on Monroe Rd in Charlotte.  NEVER NEVER NEVER again will I eat there."}
{"text":"Captain Steve's never disappoints.  They are fast. Even if they tell you there is a wait time they are faster than what they tell you. You get a lot of food and good prices. Both locations are great"}
{"text":"Captain Steve is one of our favorite restaurant to visit. When friends visit, we like to give them a meal here. The service is quick, the meals plentiful and everyone leaves with a goody bag. They recently started making fried lobster tail and it is good but I have had better. Started making fried lobster tail myself and prefer thinner dusting of flour than what they put. These are some of the largest lobster tails I've been served in a restaurant. 


It is a very family friendly restaurant. We have friends who have told us they prefer the Fort Mill location to Charlotte. The parking area has been paved within the last year so it is much better for parking than before."}
{"text":"We must have caught them on a bad night. Had been to the Matthews location several times without a bad experience. We were seated fairly quickly and our drink orders were taken in no time. Hush puppies were tasty and plentiful. It all went south from there. 
To be frank, the waiter was simply overwhelmed. He could not keep up with the number of patrons that he was asked to serve. We waited about 45 minutes for our food and only then did we get our drinks refilled. We asked for the kids menu items to be brought out as soon as they were ready and they ended up being brought to us later than the others. 
One of the entrees was incorrect and those that arrived correctly were nothing special. I had the fried cod special and it was dry and over cooked. The greens tasted old and the shrimp, freezer burnt. At least we weren't the table behind us. They waited over an hour for two entrees.
Like I said, maybe we just caught them on a bad night."}
{"text":"Went for lunch,  wife and I had Greek shrimp, crab cakes, and jumbo shrimp. Two crab cakes for $14 seems pricey, yet they were good, they were not huge.  Onion rings were cold only complaint. Waitress was very friendly made recommendations for our next visit"}
{"text":"The food was very good and cooked well. I enjoyed the broiled platter and the seasoning used on it.  Only issue was the service when I picked up the food.  I found a advertisement for a coupon that I asked about during the order and the man said they would do it.  When I got there, two men said they didn't honor any coupons and that though I was told on the phone by one of their employees, I would not be given the free item.  Very irritated and insulted."}
{"text":"I am NOT a shellfish fan but the seafood here is really good along w/ the hushpuppies! Was recommended by a person I work with and I am glad I went--and have gone several times since then. Just be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"Fish camp at its finest! Come hungry the portions are insane! My family of four ate off 2 platters & still had leftovers. The hush puppies are great! I know this will sound strange but my favorite on the menu is the bacon wrapped filet mignon."}
{"text":"I went to the Fort Mill S.C location, just because its very close by to the school I work at.  It was my first time eating here and I was surprised at the amount of people waiting to get a seat (but it was lunchtime, so understandable).  It was a nice themed place, clean and very friendly, the down south kind friendly.  Me being from California find anyone who calls me 'sweetheart' or 'honey' very endearing :)

Anyway, we were seated and immediately were served a huge pile of hushpuppies with honey butter.  It was so awesome, I just kept popping 'em in my mouth.  The other 2 teachers I was with were regulars, so they skipped the hush p's.........more for me!  I ordered the salt and peppered catfish fillets with onion rings.  And it came out fairly fast while still being fresh out of the fryer.  It also came with coleslaw, which was very unappetizing.  I enjoyed my food very much and actually felt like my pant button was about to pop out.  But I only ate about 25% off my plate!  Very huge portions, very good food and very good service.  I took home the rest and my 2 sisters had a meal out of it :D

I would go here any day and recommend it to all!"}
{"text":"Beat the lunch crowd and got fast service. Free hush puppies are so yummy! Portions were so huge had to get a box because I couldn't finish it. Need to go more often!!!"}
{"text":"Here I am Sunday afternoon Captain Steve's again going to have some fried oysters with a nice salad and of course and baked potato Service always great people always friendly and the food when you feel like seafood is great !"}
{"text":"This place came recommended by not only my hair stylist but my neighbors as well. Charlotte isn't big in the seafood scene and sometimes you just want something good besides going to a chain restaurant. I ordered the admirals platter, that had \"everything\" ; shrimp, fish, scallops, oysters, deviled crab..this is definitely a family friendly restaurant, nothing fancy but it is good eating. The servings are large with plenty to take home. The best part of the night is that when we were leaving the waitress told us to have a blessed night. Put God first, and I love it. I will be back."}
{"text":"We go here a lot but last night was terrible. The deviled crab was sour and when we told the waitress she said another customer just ordered it. She said the owner would take it off the bill but if I wanted to eat the baked potatoe I had to be charged   Asked to speak to manager and only the owner was there and it would be 15 minutes before he could get to me. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"If you are looking for comfort food in fish form, you couldn't pick a better spot. This place is so popular they had to create a system for the guests waiting for tables. One side of the lobby is for parties 5 and smaller, the other for 6 and up. It seems strange at first but the staff is able to keep things rolling and tables are prepped for new parties, quickly. 
There is a wide variety of seafood with a few items for those who prefer their protein with 4 legs. If you visit, the fried food is their specialty. Never go here on a diet, you're just going to torture yourself. The smell of hush puppies and fried shrimp will overwhelm you. They aren't known for small portions, either. This place piles it on, hot and fresh. With the amount of people who visit each day, there is no way any food is wasted from age. 
Most of the staff is younger and there seems to be a frequent turn over but with the amount of business, the restaurant staffs well and you'll always see a waiter around if yours has forgotten to fill a glass."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place after reading all the reviews and seeing the packed parking lot. However, the food was surprisingly not that great and neither was the service. Our waitress was far from being friendly and the flounder was not very good. Almost everything is fried, so be prepared for that. Wish they had more \"side\" and less fried options."}
{"text":"How do they do it?  Huge dining areas, bustling servers, massive quantities of food and it all comes together.  Menu is simple:  fried, deep fried or broiled.

There are even non-seafood items to satisfy nothing from the ocean eaters, like my wife.  Everyone can find something to eat at Steve's.

Try to come early on peak eating times, like Friday and Saturday nights.  Other nights are not a mob scene.  That said, they do get people seated pretty quick.

And if you have people from outside the South, this is a place to show them a uniquely southern experience.  We have taken new-comers, Germans and visitors and everyone enjoys it."}
{"text":"You know it's a good sign when there are so many office groups lunching together. Even though they were really busy at high noon, we were seated quickly. Before my butt had settled in the booth, a basket of hot hush puppies with honey butter was brought to the table. They were a lot smaller than the average hush puppy, but wow were they good! Our orders were taken quickly by our friendly waitress.

A couple of minutes after ordering, my salt and pepper catfish filets arrived. I ordered French fries and cole slaw as my sides. The fish was flavorful and crispy, I was worried that they would be soggy. The fries were good too, the cole slaw was average. The glass of water was quenching. That is all."}
{"text":"Overpriced for quality of meal. Forgot one of our dinners. Only three of us. Waiter sweated profusely. Salad was good. Bathroom smelled horrible like sewage. Not going back - not impressed at all. Looks better esthetically than old fish camp however lacking all else."}
{"text":"A fantastic family seafood restaurant! Service is always quick, effiecent and laced with the southern hospitality that we've come to expect in the greater charlotte area. I have never left hungry, the portions are consistent with the prices and the food is very good! They have a good variety of seafood and non seafood options as well, and offer them fried, broiled or grilled. I recommend the shrimp and chicken alfredo special! Go grab it while you can!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Seafood and I have no bad stories for Captain Steve's, I always get a hefty portion of food. The wait staff is always polite and helpful, but as I have said before and will continue to stand by is free WiFi in restaurants. An eatery of this magnitude can easily put in a half way decent WiFi system. With that being said I have to give them a 4 Star rating. They have a pick 2 or 3 combo fried or broiled, which is excellent. I just have one question of why broiled costs more then fried and when you fry you need flour plus seasoning. That is Highway robbery but everyone does it these days, they say America is an Obese Nation. Maybe we wouldn't be Obese if the Healthier food wasn't over priced compared to fried food. Can anyone tell me how a baked piece of chicken cost more than a fried piece? I didn't think so, 2+2=4 not 5. You use more money on ingredients on fried chicken than baked chicken. Well enough of my ranting on the conspiracy of fried, baked, or broiled. The food here is great and they have mastered getting their wait times down so I highly recommend you trying them sometime. 

Enjoy, I always do!!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was this evening. Nice and clean, basic ambiance, this is a place you are going to grab a bite to eat not make an evening of it. Service was very good. Jumbo Shrimp had nice light breading and were cooked perfectly, they tasted very fresh. Clams and S&P catfish strips were good. Cole slaw was fresh and tasty, onion rings crispy. Their tarter sauce is one of the best we have had. If you are hungry this is the place for you, well worth the money."}
{"text":"Came to this establishment with my family after leaving a memorial service for my late cousin. I'm very disappointed and angry to be treated as if my hard earned money isn't good enough here. We had a party of 25 people. We had no issue with the party being split into 20 and 5. Even though there were plenty of available seats near the table of 20, the restaurant refused to seat us next to them. I have never heard such foolishness. 

We even said that we would be perfectly ok with a different server and to split the tickets but, for some reason, we still weren't able to sit near our family. 5 people were forced to get up and go to the other side of the restaurant. 

They're lucky it's my \"aunt's day\". It's ridiculous that she has to deal with the emotions of losing her only child and this nonsense today. 

They won't ever get another dime of my money."}
{"text":"Nice place for seafood. Would probably go more often if they served alcohol   The shrimp cocktail is very good.  We also enjoy the peppered perch."}
{"text":"If it were 30 minutes closer to the coast, this wildly popular seafood joint would be referred to as Calabash Style. As evidenced by its vast parking lot, you can expect to wait most anytime, however, they are experts at moving people in and out. As far as fish camps/houses go, this place is tops!

You can get a \"small\" one item fried dinner for $8.95. Now, the term \"small\" is a misnomer in this place because it will easily serve two. It includes addictive hush puppies (the sweet kind), perfectly prepared cole slaw, a huge baked potato AND an additional side (I chose the collards). The flounder was expertly fried without being greasy, as were the baby shrimP.

Service was attentive and friendly. In spite of a jam packed dining area and more than 100 in line, or food arrived hot and fast! It was also remarkably clean when you consider the mob that was there.

I know it's just a humble fish house, but among similarly rated restaurant's, Captain   Steve's Fish House is a Gotta Try. In this case, the full parking lot don't lie."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but food quality, quantity, and service has really went way down.  Went on a Saturday night and place was mostly empty. I guess others already knew what I just figured out :("}
{"text":"Been to Captain Steve's a few times they have awesome hush puppies. The food is great however I wish they had regular cat fish on the menu. All and all it's still one of the better seafood places I've been to in charlotte area"}
{"text":"Always great seafood. And usually great service. 
Just don't be upset if you have to wait a few minutes for a table. It'll be worth it."}
{"text":"this is our families go to place, especially on Tuesday nights as its ALL YOU CAN EAT CRAB LEGS! The place is huge and not full on a Tuesday night. The price is perfect an I love that they bring you a plate of hot crab legs every couple of minutes so they don't all get cold. 

The only odd thing but I totally get it, is that they chain the crab leg crackers to the metal pale they bring you to discard your cracked crab legs into."}
{"text":"Captain Steve's is a great \"fish camp\" style restaurant serving very good food and in very generous portions! There is plenty of parking and the restaurant has lots of room inside! It does get loud with a lot of \"echo\" such that it can be difficult to hear those speaking around you! 
Much of their menu centers around fried seafood which is obviously what most people are coming to get! Just look around and you'll see the heaping plates of fried seafood seeing served all around you! But, as one who is trying to be mindful of calories, I can tell you that there are other preparation options available (Grilled, Blackened, etc.). 
Yesterday I had a combination of Blackened Grouper and Blackened Mahi Mahi. I would heartily recommend both of these items!! My family had fried seafood platters, combinations of various items. All were prepared well and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. In particular, there were compliments on the fried oysters! And, as always, there was enough to allow for take-home boxes after we were finished. 
I will say that the reason I didn't offer 5 stars is because there were not hardly any options for side veggies. They have slaw and you can get a salad of course. Other than that, you pick from potato products and/or fried onion rings. I would recommend considering some vegetable options to accompany the baked, broiled, and grilled seafood options. 
This restaurant gets very crowded and there can be quite a long line of people waiting to get inside. Don't forget that they have takeout behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite seafood places outside of my mother's or my kitchen. You can either go with a large party or just a couple. Food is always fresh and hot. The fried flounder and baby shrimp is my favorite."}
{"text":"Service sucks, our server dropped the F bomb in anger, said she did not have time to take our drink order.   All could be heard.  The rudest staff in the building.  
  Guess they forget servers work for tips."}
{"text":"Captain Steves is is a bit overrated I feel.   It is pretty similar to other area restaurants such as Mayflower and Captains Galley.   I really enjoyed the all you can eat crab legs on Tuesday nights, but they now limit times and have increased prices again. If you're in the area it's not a bad place to visit, but don't go out of your way to come."}
{"text":"The best fried seafood in town. Come here with family & friends. I usually get the big platter (choose 3 items) And get jumbo shrimp, oysters, & sea scallops. Comes with a side. You can add a salad for $3.25. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"(9/4/16) Well here we are back at Captain  Steve's. This time  I've  ordered  a  broiled scallop  platter with onion  rings  and  lemonade. It also came with a salad. A nice change  from  last time is that we got silverware  right from the start, no complaints  from the wife. The salad was good. The restaurant  is  pretty  busy but not packed as far as I  can  tell."}
{"text":"Best Deep-Fried Clam Strips I have eaten since Howard Johnson served them!

Last Friday I was here at 3:55pm (they open promptly at 4:00) there was a crowd already gathered at the door like a Weird Ul Concert - Out aged by all the patrons by several decades I easily pushed my way to be first in line, only to be caught holding the door for everyone except those in Wheelchairs and scooters (they were the only ones who did not trust me), once inside I decided not to run past everyone and grab a table without a hostesses assistance.

The SMALL \"Fried Clam Strips\" Dinner was a little over $8.00 with taxes added!  This \"Small\" was plenty of food (when you see my photo you can see how it is stacked) Stacked High on a large plate!  Five Stars for Value!

These fried Clams are probably frozen before they are deep fried, though they are still much better than most - A light color of batter and the thinness of the batter combined with the perfectly cooked (not the overly cooked too crispy you see in many places) then piled high on my plate made a great dinner! 

Onion Rings, FRESH not frozen - that is worth some stars!  The flavor was good (not great) probably because everything is cooked in the same oil so some of the flavors are transferred!  The batter was good on these and like the clams they were perfectly cooked!

The Hush Puppies were A-OK, as in 3 yelp stars and no more, still better than many and only a few that I have tasted were a lot better!

The lady serving me was good at explaining that the Small dinner was quite large and if I wanted extra clams to make it a \"large\" food after I finished the Small they could add the difference - Great suggestion, though the small was plenty!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better family-style seafood restaurants I have dined at in quite a while. The food is very good, reasonably priced and the portions are huge! 

The menu features a large variety of seafood, as well as steaks, chicken and pasta. The lunch menu is equally as good. 

I recommend Captain Steve's!!!"}
{"text":"It was very quick service and very reasonably priced   Staff were very nice.  Food was ok but for the price I guess it was a bargain"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat if you like quantity over quality. They certainly bring you enough food. The quality is medium and the service, the same. I barely give this place 3 stars. The one in Charlotte gets 2 stars - the one in Fort Mill is better."}
{"text":"Oh how I've been longing for some fried fish and all I can say is.... DELICIOUS!! Our server Mary was warm, welcoming, attentive but not intrusive. The food was seasoned appropriately, and served hot. This place was packed but yet service was on point. I can tell that the staff works as a team and that is what makes it successful.  Excellent food + excellent customer service= 5 ! I will be back!"}
{"text":"A little drive on I77 towards FortMill took us to the restaurant I was hoping to visit for a really long time. There was a huge queue at the door but it moved quickly and we were seated in a few minutes. Looking at the menu, I saw what I expected to see. Fried sea food! But there were a few unexpected items too. Chicken Parmesan! And a couple of other chicken dishes. 
Our waitress was very caring and helpful. She was quick to bring us the food and phased them so that the appetizers are not brought along with the entrees. The free hush puppies they give you at the beginning of the meal is alright. Beware, even the ordering the small platters will end up with tons of fried food. So gorge less on the hush puppies and the appetizers.

I got the Fried Flounder and baby shrimp with Onion rings. The flounder was mildly flavorful and the baby shrimp was again lacking the flavor punch. I do get that its fried food but the huge let down was there wasn't any flavors! I took a look around at the other patrons and they were taking home huge to-go boxes of fried food. When you eat the onion rings from say Buffalo Wild Wings, I bet you would finish up the whole plate - because it has good flavors even though it is fried.

The only suggestion I have is that a huge plate of bland tasting fried food is not what we need. Of course, everyone likes fried food - especially fried seafood. But if the management could revisit the cooking process to add more flavor into your fries and also review your platter and try to through in some non-fried food/sides along with the main entrees so that the plate becomes more appetizing and we, your guests don't get the sweet taste of oil churning our stomachs after a few bites of the entree."}
{"text":"As a new resident to the area I kept asking everyone what was a place most tourists don't know about that is a great place to eat and almost everyone told me Captain Steve's.  I am happy to say I was not disappointed at all.  Upon a recommendation I ordered the captains platter with catfish, fried oysters, scallops, deviled crap, fried baby shrimp, and hush puppies.  Without a doubt the best scallops I have had in years!  And the fried oysters were absolute perfection.  I could not even eat the catfish until the next day there was so much food, but it's was great as well.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is like many of the reviews the noise levels are very loud, but I guess it's from everyone talking how great the food is!  

If you are wondering should you try it or not.. Wonder no more!  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The wife and I ate here for probably the 30th time. It had been a while. Okay, this place is amazing!! Long line out front, but since there was only 2 of us, we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Waitress took our order immediately. She was great. we split the Captain Steve's Platter. Flounder, jumbo shrimp, Calabash shrimp, oysters, scallops and deviled crab. Need I say more? You CANNOT get better fish camp seafood anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely poor tonight.  It took 50 minutes for our food in an unpacked house.  We seen people seated after us get their food. We asked to speak with management and they never came.  The staff consistently reports,\"they busy.\"  We spending $80.00 plus but ur to busy. When leaving we asked again to speak with management & the staff tells me,  \"they busy & I'm tired so u gonna have to wait.\" Management cursing staff out & ignoring customers!  

If you are a business, customer service is PRIORITY. We are the people that keeps ur doors open and the opportunity for ur business to operate.  It's sad that management and staff are not trained in servicing. I will be writing an article on this poor service, communication & food."}
{"text":"My all time favorite go to quick, cheap, and delicious seafood. Yes it's a chain and I hate chains but THIS location mind as well be solo dolo. The servers are great...and my last visit I had the pleasure of getting Felix(hope it's spelled right). My family rushed in 45 minutes before closing and he attended to us very patiently and kindly. He even kept going back to get whatever my kids needed every time without a problem. Now that's customer service. And with Captain Steve's, you get enough food to actually take lunch to work the next day...and to me that's economical and worth going back"}
{"text":"Omg this place is sooo yummy, the waitress was nice and they gave us Huge portions for Lunch. I like fried perch, shrimp didn't like stuff crab. But it was edible. Personal thing there. But the best seafood I have had in a while.  I will be back for suers. Hush puppies to die for with sweet honey butter. None stop"}
{"text":"Great fried seafood! The portions are HUGE! You will definitely be leaving with a to go box. I got the combination with catfish (salt and peppered), baby shrimp, and clam strips with a baked potato. Everything was so great! The line is always long but they have an excellent system that keeps the line moving pretty good so the wait won't be as long as it looks. Plus it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was a little worried about this place, since it is in Fort Mill, it's called Capt. Steve's, and it was kind of cartoony.  To say I was very surprised when I actually started eating would be an under statement.  Nothing here was over fried, was fried nice and lightly.  I had the fried oysters, which were some of the best I've had, and yes, I live by the ocean.  Definitely worth the quick stop in, but beware of the crowds, they come in \"schools\".  Haha!"}
{"text":"Consistantly good food.  Staff very nice and attentative.  Very loud which I'm not a fan of, but it was absolutely packed so it is what it is.  We ordered the fishermans platter and only got 4 scallops, 1 piece of fish, 4 jumbo shrimp along with a deviled crab and a ton of teeny tiny shrimp that we didn't bother to eat.  That is the only thing that bothered me.  Other than that I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Southern fried seafood at its best - and worst. Very large portions. Super busy restaurant regardless of day of week. Not a place that would be confused as having a nice atmosphere. It is very loud inside. It seems that most people resort to yelling to be heard, even to the wait staff."}
{"text":"Captain Steve's was the first \"fish camp\" I went to when I moved here years ago. Their Fort Mill location. I had to ask before going what a fish camp was. Really enjoyed it. Capt. Steve took over this location from another fish camp which I really love. Steve's is your go-to place for some good fried fish and lots of it."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great prices. Captain Steve's is one of my favorite places to eat. Better go early, they fill up fast, especially on the weekend."}
{"text":"Seafood was fried just the way I like with the exception of no flaver!!! Add some seasoning next time and I'll give 5 stars"}
{"text":"In our mid 30s so perhaps our review is a little different. First impressions are Full of kids and yellow walls nothing glamorous in the decor and some plastic seats, not a place for a quiet meal. Our  service to get a seat was quick but it's been taking a while for the standard hush puppies and our apps. Plastic plates is a new experience no silverware or napkins think we had a bad server to be honest. Portion sizes are good few photos attached to the page. I will say you feel greasy after eating this stuff"}
{"text":"This is the first seafood restaurant my family and I became fans of when we first moved to the Charlotte area almost seven years ago. We used to visit a location that was further out and are so thankful for the Harrisburg location! It's a great place for families since their meal portions are HUGE. My mom and I usually share a small platter (of the flounder) and are fully satisfied and stuffed. The service is very friendly and the inside decor is slightly cheesy. I also must give them kudos on their carryout service - very friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"The food is okay... we got a lot of food for reasonable prices. The real problem is with the service. The waitress that we got was very rude and sarcastic. When we got the hush puppies, the butter that came with it was going bad. When opened, we complained about it, and simply asked for another pack of butter. She said multiple times \"That isn't bad, that's fine, nothings wrong with that butter, you can eat it.\" After about 3 times asking her to just get another one because we didn't feel comfortable eating it, bad or not, she finally went and got butter. After that, we got our food which was great other than the fact that you have to add salt to your fries or onion rings. While we ate, the waitress made us feel really uncomfortable by coming to us and asking us in a really nasty tone, \"is anything wrong with your food\". All in all, it's okay of you are willing to deal with having sub par food shoved down your throat like a kid at school lunch."}
{"text":"Tanya was our waitress she was prompt and very nice. I was very skeptical about going because I had a bad experience at their other location in Harrisburg NC. Wow I had Shrimp Cocktail, boiled Shrimp, Cole Slaw, Hush puppies, and fries. The food was awesome the shrimp was not overdone the hush puppies were not burnt the Cole Slaw tasted very good in my opinion the best I've had in a very long time! I have to say even the cocktail sauce was just right not bland. The ambience was nice, as were guided to our seats the restaurant was clean no litter or food on the floor. No sooner than people were leaving someone was there cleaning the table off. All of the staff we encountered there were courteous and friendly. We told Tanya of our experience at the other Captain Steve's and she was very understanding I can't wait for my next trip!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6. BE WARNED 6 or more is a automatic 18% gratuity added to your bill regardless of the service you receive! Everything started out well. The place was not super busy but in our section there were several families seated. The drinks took a little longer than usual. Then ordered apps for everyone. 2 shrimp cocktails, fried pickles (these are sliced lengthwise- so long & thin) & a bowl of she crab soup. I had a shrimp cocktail to start. Followed by rib eye steak with a side of jumbo shrimp ($5 extra) and French fries. My husband ordered a TBone with a side of Shrimp ($5 extra)  and a baked potato. We both also had salad.  I also tried fried pickles and she crab soup. Really liked the pickles (about 7of them). I've never tried she crab soup & this was ok, but the person who ordered said she has had better. When the dinner order got to us I got a baked potato not fries the TBone was well done not medium the sides of shrimp were spongy and tasted awful there was no taste to them. Tasted like they were microwaved. My bill was $121.18 plus the18% gratuity which they added to my bill! When we asked for a manager (George) came over and with a bit of an attitude staring the gratuity is written on the menu & posted at entrance. when we stated our grievances and explained all the issues we are going to tip her but the service wasn't worth 18% he got mad and took the receipt &  and stormed off. When he returned he handed me the receipt and stormed off not saying anything. I don't think I will ever eat at captain Steve's Seafood again if I and my family and friends are going to be treated like this.  We did leave her $13. For tip. It was the repeatedly having to ask for items we needed & it taking a long time which effected her tip. It's even more so the attitude of George that made the whole experience a fail!"}
{"text":"The hush puppies are addicting and the best I've had!  Although there aren't a lot of healthy options, they make incredible food.  I love the stuffed deviled crab and they're sweet tea is perfect... just wished I could get a glass of bubbles!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent fried shrimp, scallops and flounder. Onion rings were very good. Hush puppies were excellent.  Fast and friendly service. Best seafood you're gonna find in this land-locked town!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by the front desk clerk at the Quality Inn at Carowinds, Janie.

Wow, this place is great. From your complimentary basket of hush puppies, to your drink always being refilled and the excellent taste of the food. I got the beef and cheese sandwich with fries. Also got a bowl of clam chowder since it was so cold outside. 

All the servers help each other out, so you're never waiting on anything. Excellent service.

Will come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"eight of us dined here Friday night it was quick hush puppies are good the french fries were good but I should've known better than to order chicken at a seafood place it left something to be desired overall everyone said it was okay"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The portion sizes were great compared to the price you pay per platter. I went during Mother's Day weekend and was able to be seated and served in a fairly timely manner. Food was very tasty, seasoned, and fresh! If you're looking for good seafood, be sure to stop here! They also have a lot of seating for large parties. P.S. I'm from a beach area so I know good seafood :)"}
{"text":"Came into the restaurant and didn't realize they closed in 15 minutes. Hostess was friendly. Waitress was very pleasant and helpful. Food came out very hot and lots of it!  Chef came out to help bring the food. It's not fancy but the food was delicious. It's the closest I can get the Fish Farm of my youth. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First time here, probably won't go back. We had a group of 8 so a good sampling all around. I had he all-you-can-eat crab legs. They were okay. The hush puppies were the best thing on the menu. Everything just tasted the same, though, and the mac and cheese came out like soup. Horrible. Service was friendly, but sporadic. We had to ask for everything (butter, tarter sauce, water, 2nd beer, etc.) She was very attentive though when I offered one of my legs I wasn't going to eat to a friend. They really mean no sharing. Guess it's better to throw it away."}
{"text":"I have been to the location in SC.  I did not know this location existed until my lunch date.  They give you plenty of food and the service was very good. I will visit this location again."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is busy but copes very well with it. The portions are HUGE!!! Reasonably priced with great friendly service. I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ate at Capt. Steve's last night, and I've paid the price ALL DAY!! That have to be buying cheap fish. Grilled flounder filets were about an 1/8 of a inch thick. That's being gracious. They were coated with an awful seasoning. Had grilled shrimp to go with it. They were as rubbery as any I've had. But hey, I was hungry, so I ate it. Up half the night with unbelievable gas, and all day today with the trots!! Severe Trots!! So long Capt Steve, you sunk your own ship!!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since they opened and I love the consistency! Food is always great portions are huge and the hushpuppies...ohhh. I crave those!"}
{"text":"Always great - nothing left to say.....  Well okay, i hate the line!!!,  maybe we should all leave bad reviews to cut down our wait time"}
{"text":"To go service was fast and accurate. Large platter is wayyyy too much for one person! I had the Large fried platter w/ salt & pepper cat fish strips, oysters, and scallops. The fried oysters were my favorite, very well seasoned. I didn't care for the homemade lemonade it had an odd after taste but everything else was great. My mom got the broiled platter with jumbo shrimp and scallops and also had no complaints. She liked the lemonade. I'd definitely visit again, but will not order a large platter as it will take days for one person to get through!!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yummy...  We love to get take out and love their shrimp!  I get the large fried while my husband likes the pile of small fried shrimp. Comes w tasty hush puppies, baked potato, and coleslaw. Husband loves that I'm not a coleslaw fan as he gets them both. Lucky man (so I understand)!  Worth checking out for sure!  If you dine in: friendly and capable wait staff. Have been going there for years."}
{"text":"We got out Church at noon,walked in a no one greeted us for at least 5 minutes or so. There was a fishy not so pleasant smell. I thought after all it's a fish restaurant. When we was seated the service was excellent, when got our food it was horrible. We tried to eat it but the smell of the food. It was like it was not spoiled but so near it. We didn't say anything to the waiter we paid our check and left the food on the table. The waiter asked if we wanted a take out box I wanted scream are you kidding, but I politely said no."}
{"text":"I like the fried seafood at this place. It is usually very crisp(which I prefer) and is very flavorful. There are two areas where they could improve and rate 5 stars:

1. They need to make their own tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. The great fish camps in surrounding counties (Gaston, especially) does this and it sets them apart. It would be worth their time to develop these as what they have is not great and tastes like it comes from a jar. Homemade hush puppies would be great also. 

2. The combination plates can be skimpy, based on what you order. If I go to long creek fish fry in Gaston County, jones fish camp in Caldwell county, or Lincoln Seafood in Lincoln County, you can expect 4-5 flounder filets and 6-8 chicken tenders on a combination plate. Here, I've ordered the same and received one small flounder filet and three tenders. That's not much compared to other camps in the area. 

Overall, this place is recommended. The food is good and the workers at the takeout window are great!"}
{"text":"I am new in town and had heard that Captain Steve's was good.  So I went there on a Friday night with my daughter.  The parking lot was extremely full so I expected a long wait- but was seated right away.  Friendly waitresses.  A little loud but it added to the feel.  Food was very reasonably priced for seafood.  I had broiled seafood platter, and all of it was cooked well and seasoned well.  Good portions- I couldn't even eat my potato or half of the seafood, had to take it home!  My daughter had the grilled chicken.  Three good pieces of meat, and she said it was the best chicken she had ever had; and she's a foodie.  I highly recommend, and will return again."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant in the Charlotte area. Great selection of both healthy and fried fish. The crab legs are great and Tuesday is all you can eat crab legs. The Alaskan white fish is also great. Kids and adults love it! Our fav family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pros- Good food and good service. Waiter and waitress worked hard for our party of 16. This is obviously a good fish camp with all the cars in the parking lot and folks inside. Fried oysters, flounder, and scallops were good. Deviled crab was excellent! Slaw and hush puppies were very good.

Con- I ordered collard greens as my side and they were terrible. Not going to say they are out of a can...I don't work in the back so I don't know."}
{"text":"If you like lots of fried seafood this is your place. They also have broiled. I like the fried and for the price you can eat at least 2 meals with the left overs. They pile it on. I always get the oysters and scallops fried which I like and eat on it a couple times afterward as its so much food. If you like fried this is your place."}
{"text":"It may be I compare to places like Hymens in Charleston or crab catchers in little river sc. It was average overall.  Clean and good service.  Clam strips good.  Flounder was ok.  Frozen or tasted as such.  But not bad.  Liked onion rigs tarter sauce hush puppies clam strips but once again not great.  Pretty good."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  I enjoyed the shrimp. Didn't really care for the hush puppies. Waiter was very friendly."}
{"text":"Dear Captain Steve's

Your prices are fair, your portion sizes are huge, your employees are kind, and you are consistent with all of these things. When you were on Monroe Rd you were great and I followed you to your current location and you remained an amazing place to eat. Coming here is a priority when I come home to visit because you are that wonderful!

To Yelpers what is good here??? literally everything, I like to get the fish sandwich and take the second filet off and save it for the next day because the portion is so big. My best friend loves the fried oysters and has even said they are the best she has ever had in her life from any fish camp out here. My parents like the perch and flounder and it is fried to perfection never soft always nice and crispy!

Over the course of about 12 plus years I have tried the entire menu here and you really can not go wrong with anything get it salt and peppered for extra flavor or just regular if you like things in the not so seasoned side I've had it both ways and it is wonderful. Definitely give this place a try if you're into southern seafood not a better fish camp for miles!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great, casual seafood restaurant! This place is really popular, so there's usually a lot of people, but never a wait. I enjoy the pick two/three fish meal. It's enough food to eat twice over again for a very inexpensive price. It's definitely a great family restaurant.. I love it!"}
{"text":"After trying five times over the last year to eat here we finally were able to get in.  Every time we drive by the place is always very crowded.  After a ten min wait we were seated and checked out the menu.  Kids had a cheeseburger which I heard was very good, I had the broiled shrimp,  Greek style,  I thought the shrimp could have been cooked a little longer, I don't usually like them soft texture wise but it wasn't bad.  We also had the fried shrimp version which was a little better.  This is a popular place but I don't see myself needing to come back, it wasn't worth anymore than a ten-fifteen minute wait, anymore than that and I would go elsewhere.   It's basically  no frills seafood at an ok price."}
{"text":"Tried Captain Steve's (take out) for the the first time this evening. We ordered three meals: The Fisherman's Platter, Fried Oysters, and Small Shrimp. The portions were generous but the taste was pedestrian at best. The seafood was on par with that of similar places like Captain's Galley and Mayflower, but the baked potatoes were overcooked, the onion rings were limp, and the hush puppies were the worst we have ever had. Not going back."}
{"text":"Family dinner night at our favorite fish restaurant. Of course I started off inhaling the FREE hush puppies they give you when you arrive. It was quite busy last night for a Tuesday.

Our server I don't remember her name, but the entire time she seemed a bit jumpy and flustered. I'm not sure if it was her first day or what but she wasn't getting anything right. 

I ordered the 2 fried platter and chose salt and pepper flounder with baby shrimp and a baked potato. Great portion size for me and I even had plenty left over for the next day. 

As we all prepared to pay, our server had forgotten or didn't properly write down what everyones ordered. We provided her with this information, then along with our choice of payment. When she came back she was unsure who's order was which. She had our table mixed with another table she was serving. Once she had everything corrected, my parents noticed the senior discount wasn't applied so she had to find a manager to take care of that. After an additional 15minutes of waiting she returns with our sign copies and some how misplaced my parents debit card. My parents were completely fine with it because we could tell how frustrated she was with herself and upset she was getting. Again I'm not sure what was going on with her, but it unfortunately was reflecting in her work. After another 15minutes and everyone in high search for my parents card she finally found it in another check booklet. 

She asked us not to tip her because of how horrible everything was but were not that type of family. We made sure she was taken care of. But I needed to share this so that Captain Steve's would be aware."}
{"text":"This is my first time here at captain steves. I've heard about it for years. So here we go.
I went with the to go option. The cashier was very nice, and knowledgeable. I explained my wife being celiac and she knew just how to lead me. Greatly appreciated. 
Most of the customers seemed like regulars and everyone seemed so nice to one another. What a welcomed change. 
The food took about 20 minutes. The smell on the drive home was incredible. I order the grilled scallops and jumbo shrimp. Also the hamburger steak. The meals came with salads and side. The family enjoyed everything! If the wife makes it through the night without becoming sick, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eating with a child with many allergies. This restaurant was extremely accommodating. They went above and beyond to make sure our little guy had a yummy meal."}
{"text":"Favorite part of the meal - hush puppies and sweet tea! I think i can just eat that for dinner."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews my wife and I decided to give it a try. We were seated very quickly and waited on just as fast. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Our table was toward the rear where the bus boys waited to clear the next table. My wife was very uncomfortable with them standing over us. We changed seats to help with that. Our food arrived very quickly and as stated the fried flounder my wife ordered was a lot of food for a small platter. It was a little too fishy tasting for her.My blackened Mahi was very tasty but very small, good thing I stuffed myself on the hush puppies. Knowing my wife we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I ate here once and once only it wasn't a good experience my moms steak was over cooked and my grandmothers fish was freezer burned"}
{"text":"This is a good place for lunch. Their prices are great, and they'll broil anything for a dollar more. Even though we're not on the coast, the seafood tasted fresh. I had to pick the bones out of the flounder, but that is usually a good sign if you're looking for freshness. The service is warm and friendly and the environment is comfortable. Great local place."}
{"text":"Wasn't crowded when we went. We were seated as soon as we came in. The hush puppies were hot. They were just ok. We ordered fried pickles and fried oysters for appetizers. Both were really good. I had all you can eat crab legs with collards and a salad. The salad was good but the dressing could have been better. I had the greek dressing. The collards are ok they are really chopped and smokey. My crab legs where warm some were watery and had no taste, most of them were ok. They need something to keep the butter warm while you eat your crab legs, it was kind of cool in there so my butter kept turning into paste. My Wife had the Steve Platter it was loaded with shrimp, scallops, fish, and a grab cake. The crab cake was not good it had to much breading. For desert we had sweet potato pie, and key lime pie, both of them were good. I will be back for the fried oysters, fried shrimp, scallops, the key lime pie, and to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food seafood is awesome friendly staff nice atmosphere relax and great for group outing really recommend this place"}
{"text":"I have been stopping in at Captain Steve's for MANY years.  The food quality is always great and they herd the people through there quickly.  
Sometimes it does get very loud as they are set up to cater to large groups/families.  
No matter as  you will get some great Fish, Shrimp, Hush puppies, Steaks, Chops or Chicken!  Don't think that just because they are a seafood place that the Steaks, Chops or Chicken won't be good because you would be WRONG! 

If you see a line, don't let it bother you because they are fast at getting you in and seated."}
{"text":"Did the take out... Food was good but service was lacking. If I'm paying $12 a plate for take out then I want  a \"thank you\" at minimum.. I got no verbal, no napkins, no condiments, no utensils... Ruined an otherwise good meal"}
{"text":"Good food - little loud, crazy busy most nights, good portions, a lot of fried foods - there are other options too. friendly staff"}
{"text":"Ate here for the 1st time as I just recently moved to Charlotte.  Foods soo good.  And the portion sizes are humongous.  Get the pick 2 off the \"small\" side of the menu.  And nothing about it was small.  Was more than enough for me. The service was great,  had no complaints!   Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight and it was nice to go on a night when there isn't a million people there.  Party of 6, we were sat right away and greeted by our server.  I had the grilled choice of 2 with flounder and grilled jumbo shrimp.  For $13.95 this is hands down one of the best values in town for seafood.  3 large fillets of nicely seasoned fish and like 8 or 9 grilled jumbo shrimp which was perfectly cooked and seasoned well.  Baked Potato, salad and some of the best hushpuppies around.  Here's my thing, I don't like regular hushpuppies because their mostly overly fried and bland.  Captain Steve's are fried, but they have a hint of onion in their mix which makes them delectable.

This is truly one of the hidden gems of this area and should not be missed."}
{"text":"The only things I don't care for are the booths are not very comfortable, like reverse ergonomics. And the catsup is very watered down and bland. The food is aplenty and very fresh and hot. The service is still friendly and the sweet iced tea is great as well, not bitter at all unlink many restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful fish camp. Great fried food, large entrees (recommend sharing) , great service. A cool place to people watch too"}
{"text":"The salad and hush puppies are great, but everything else is very greasy. It was just ok."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this bad experience left an unprofessional air and aggravation. Placed four take out orders and after the order was placed at 1:43PM, the server on the phone announced that they closed at 2:PM! We called back after this was said, and we were hung up on, and we asked why order was taken and then time given? Her response was they open back at 4:PM. We canceled orders and was hung up on, again. Don't think we will frequent this business in the future."}
{"text":"Captain Steve's has some pretty delicious and definitely inexpensive fried fish.  However, their sides (except the hush puppies) are nothing to write home about, which is a little disappointing.

I have been here a few times now.  On my first trip, I ordered the small plate of the fried Alaskan whitefish.  My partner ordered Steve's Fisherman platter.  Just before taking our order, the waitress brought us a basket of hush puppies with tubs of honey butter.  The hush puppies were fresh and quite delicious.  Then came our massive quantities of food.  The \"small\" platter of fish came with three large filets, more hush puppies, a heaping portion of onion rings, and a small plastic bowl of coleslaw.  The fish comes either with salt and pepper or plain.  I ordered the salt and pepper, and the fish was just delicious!  The batter completely coated the fish, but it was not too heavy and the seasoning was just right.  My biggest complaint is with the onion rings and slaw.  The rings were obviously made from scratch, but the batter was quite plain and the rings were flavorless.  The cabbage in the slaw was basically minced, and it was the slightly sweet vinegar style, which I don't care for at all.  But the fish was truly, truly delicious.

Steve's Platter included fried flounder (in the salt and pepper batter), calabash shrimp, deviled crab, fried oysters, fried scallops, and fried baby shrimp.  The flounder was also very tasty, although not as good as the whitefish (more fishy-tasting, but not necessarily bad).  The calabash shrimp was also SO delicious, with the texture and consistency of the batter being quite perfect.  The deviled crab reminded me of a crab cake with more of a pickle flavor, and I enjoyed it.  My partner greatly enjoyed the fried oysters, and while I am generally don't like oysters, I enjoyed them too.  The scallops were quite good, but very rich.  Finally, the baby shrimp were good and quite plentiful.  He also ordered the onion rings, and on the large platters, the sides are even larger still.  

Other reviewers are correct - this is an INSANE amount of food.  I have always left here full and with another leftovers for a whole other meal.

Service has always been good.  The wait staff each time has been friendly and quite helpful.  The decor is very fitting, with fish and fishing gear spread across the restaurant.  However, I will say that it is quite loud in there when it gets busier in there.  Sound really seems to echo in there.

Other important things to know - Tuesdays is all you can eat crab legs night.  It costs $32 a person, but they bring out buckets of crab legs to the table.  On Wednesdays kids eat free.  The also offered broiled seafood for those who are wanting to be slightly more health-conscious.  It's also pretty reasonably priced.  My partner and I have gotten two dinners and two drinks, and each time walked out of there full for less than $30 + tip.  Come here with a big appetite.

So their seafood and hush puppies are both pretty decent.  However, this place would be even more magnificent if they just had some better sides (maybe dip the onion rings into the salt & pepper batter).  They get a solid 3 for now."}
{"text":"I always get the salt & pepper Alaskan Whitefish and I'm never disappointed. Portions here are generous and the prices are very reasonable. The homemade hush puppies are addictive. It's a very popular local place so be prepared to wait - it's worth it!"}
{"text":"We  made reservations here for my mom's 90th Birthday for a party of nine for Saturday Sept. 2. Pete, the manager, said they normally don't take reservations, but he'd make an exception for this request. Our reservation was for 4:00 pm, which we arrived five minutes early. The hostess had no idea what my dad was talking about and that there was no reservations. We waited ten more minutes to be seated. The hostess brought us to a table for six, even though we had a party of nine. We pulled an adjacent table over to accommodate our group. My dad requested to speak to the manager. The manager on duty (he never gave his name) showed up and immediately asked \"What's the problem?.\" My dad told him he made reservations with Pete for my mom's 90th Birthday. This manager told us Pete was off this weekend and that the reservation was \"Pete's deal\". He stated that they don't take reservations because there too busy for that on weekends. He said \"too bad, what do you want me to do about it? Then he walked away. What ever happened to customer service? He never even apologized. We reluctantly stayed to enjoy my mom's Birthday. This was a big deal, mom's 90th Birthday, with immediately family. All of us came from out of town and out of state to be with her. The next time , oh that's right, there won't be a next time here. We'll gladly take our business somewhere else. This was sincerely the poorest customer service and the manager on duty should be retrained on his interpersonal and management skills."}
{"text":"Captain Steve's is very welcoming! Makes you feel like your in a boat when you walk in! The food was awesome and great portion for the price! Service was very good and never had an empty drink. Will definitely be back to get my seafood fix!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night. Very noisy and factory like. Broiled flounder was good but not flounder. Some sort of soft white fish. Had to fight to get some cold tarter sauce without another 50 cents. Wait staff is caring and attentive but they have some stupid penny pinching rules to deal with.  Do not go with a group of seven. It will take forever to get a table. Must have 4 or 16 to get in quickly."}
{"text":"The volume of business here is testament to the truism that if you batter and deep fry the  hell out of anything edible, you'll have a line out the door waiting to pay you for the experience of consuming it. Overall it's good and the portions are nice. Somewhere past all the fried there is fish (or so I\"m told)."}
{"text":"When you have to have really fresh and tasty seafood you must go to Captain Steve's. The wait is never too long no matter how many people you see waiting in the lobby. My go-to favorite is the combo plate with salt & pepper catfish (on the bone) and baby shrimp fried with fries or baked potato. The hush puppies are good as well. All of the staff are nice and friendly. I would give them 5 stars but at times it takes longer to get your food than it does to be seated on a super busy night! Otherwise, it's all good up in the seafood neighborhood!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. We have been eating here for years but apparently recently there has been a change in ownership and this place has went down from here. The food is tasteless and has absolutely no flavor. I ordered from here recently and they ruined my order and when I called to tell them the manager was super rude and hung up on me. I was absolutely  taken because all of my experiences prior had been awesome. The manager above him then called me back to apologize and asked how she could fix it. I replied a refund with be nice since we hadn't eaten the food minus tasting it. She told me they couldn't do that. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I like the concept of Captain Steve's.  A wide variety of seafood, both healthy and not so healthy. We had a great waitress, Taylor, and did enjoy our dinner. 

A couple of things I didn't like. One, it was incredibly noisy.  I couldn't hear my husband at all and he was right across from me.  So if you have kids, or a noisy party, this is THE place for you.  I just didn't care for it.

Second, the portions are enormous. I mean just huge. No one needs that much food.  On the plus side you get a lot of food for not a lot of money.

My husband had the snapper and enjoyed it.  I had the boiled shrimp, cold and liked it as well. You get a big basket of hush puppies too, which is nice, but again, so much food.

We'll likely not go back, but I do recommend it for large parties and families with young kids."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is really a find. The portions are enormous. Selection is great. Get here early though the place fills quickly. I was with a large bus of people & they were on the ball. Everyone had a take home box & we all were full to our eyeballs. 

Very good food"}
{"text":"the portions are huge and reasonably priced but still AVOID THIS PLACE
skip the side of grilled shrimp! tasteless rubbery shrimp!
shrimp cocktail was nice and the cocktail sauce served with it was much better than that on the table.
fried pickles were tasty
she crab soup was just ok- as a Charleston SC native I have had much much better! 
our server tried to be helpful, but she was quite forgetful. we had to ask 2-3 times for the things we needed and she must have had other things to do elsewhere in the restaurant as we had a hard time getting her when we needed her. 
parties of 6 or more is apparently a automatic 18% gratutity added to your check- which in my experience is license for them to give you crappy service! We did voice our disapproval of this as we did not see this in the entrance or on the menu but that was pointed out by the manager GEORGE who we asked to speak with. and his attitude towards us was less than professional. We told him that we believed she deserved a tip- just not 18% as we had several issues that had happened, we didn't want anything comp'd for us although some things should've been. 
When you are spending $130 on dinner - the service and quality should've been a lot better! So he angrily took the recipt and removed the gartutity - when he returned and gave it back he did not say a word. NO apology or anything! So thanks George- your true colors tell me to never return and to not recommend anyone else to come!"}
{"text":"This is not the haven of great seafood but it was okay.  Fried oysters were good but the shrimp were like little pieces of over cooked breading."}
{"text":"Visiting the area with family. The restaurant was in close proximity to our hotel. They were busy but the wait was very quick and short for a busy Friday night. Our waitress was friendly and attentive (although they were busy). The seating includes not booths and tables. They provide complimentary hush puppies for the table and sweet (butter-like) whipped spread to go with them- yummy! Our dinner was hot and the portions were huge! Too much food! My parents had catfish (on the bone) and they loved it. My mother is a picky country girl so her standards are high...she raved about her \"hot catfish\" and her \"hot sweet potato\"...of course dad did not complain, other the fact that he loved his food, my mom was happy. Points for him. Lol :) My husband had steamed shrimp, ribeye steak and a salad. He rates the steak at an 7.5 out of 10...salad was fresh and delicious. My fried oysters were awesome! And my loaded baked potato was good; the loaded toppings were put on the side in small containers. If you are looking for a laid-back, family-oriented seafood or American dinner spot, I recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Captain Steve's for about 20 years now and always have been satisfied. The food is great and the portions are huge. The Captain really knows how to run a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place.   It reminds me of any of the large strip seafood joints in Myrtle Beach.  The place is ALWAYS packed, in fact, I cannot remember a time when I have driven by or enjoyed a meal, that the entire dining area was not full.

The hush puppies are scrumptious and the friend shrimp was crisp and tasted fresh (I assume, I am not sure if fried shrimp can taste fresh).

Be warned however, tons of breading and a fair share of grease will leave you feeling guilty and sad, but not until a few hours after the meal is over.  Well worth (on occasion) in my book."}
{"text":"Fantastic fried seafood.  The hush puppies are fantstic!!  And served with honey spread!!  Very addicive.  Very popular and usually a wait but the lone goes fast."}
{"text":"I have been excited to check this place out for months.  Unfortunately my excitement ended after the hush puppies.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi blackened, with a baked potato and salad.  The salad was alright, the Mahi Mahi obviously was frozen as it was dry and my onion rings.  Oh wait I didn't order onion ring but that is what I received.  So I asked them to bring out my baked potato.  I opened it up and I know the saying \" a little dirt never hurt\" but since they were baked the dirt turned to mud and it was all over my potato in clumps.  Needless to say I didn't eat it, sent it back and they offered me another salad as a courtesy.  Which I declined. 

I wanted so bad to like this place, since it is hard to get my wife to go to any place that specializes in seafood.    The hush puppies were really good, but it is hard not to like deep fried corn cornmeal batter covered in honey butter.  Other than that, it was nice that kids eat free on Wednesday's which was the only saving grace of this meal that I didn't have to pay for their meals."}
{"text":"Go here for great seafood. It is busy but worth the short wait. Love going here to see large families enjoying their meal with each other. If you are not use to loud happy restaurants, please go to some fancy overpriced fish place. If you want large portions of great seafood then this is the place."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Overpriced and doesn't taste fresh. Staff is not particularly warming. Cheesy decor without being fun. Good hush puppies."}
{"text":"We've only eaten here twice however each time our experience was great.  To start off with they bring out their signature hush puppies that are delicious.  The food usually comes out in a timely manner especially for the amount of customers that frequent the restaurant.  The portions are very filling and more than likely you will carry home a to go box. The food seems fresh, which is important when eating at a seafood restaurant.  We will continue to eat here whenever we have a seafood craving, Captain Steve's is now our go to seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 10 (or so) around Christmas 2014. They were eager to go and I, having heard so much about the place for many years, was eager as well.

The waitstaff was attentive and if I remember correctly, we all pretty much got our food at the same time. However, my food was warm but not hot, so...

It wasn't awful but I have had better. 

I know it can be difficult to accommodate large groups in terms of meal delivery. But I would rather some of us get our food later if it means everyone's food is hot and fresh-tasting.

I won't go again."}
{"text":"A great spot, always better than average service, and take out is a good option too.  For a \"fish camp,\" I think it's the best in the area."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came to this restaurant last night. I haven't been here in over 5 years (the last time I was here when I was like, 14 and still living with my family). I don't eat seafood (except shrimp), but I did remember they do have other options too. The parking lot was kind of full when we entered, so I guess that was a good thing. We got seated right away, and immediately got our drinks and hushpuppies. I literally couldn't stop eating them. They were so fluffy and good! The best part of the meal we had all night.

I ordered the chicken tenders with fries, and my fiance ordered the Captain's Grilled Platter. The food came with decent timing, but the tenders had absolutely no seasoning. So, so disappointing. The fries were nothing special either. I hardly touched them. The coleslaw also tasted like mushed up baby food.

The Captain's Grilled Platter comes with a fried crab (we had no idea what it was at first), a baked potato (with the skin soggy and burnt), a piece of flounder, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and coleslaw. He wasn't very hungry and wanted to bring the leftovers home. We noticed that more customers were being seated, and didn't think nothing of it at first. Then, we noticed that our waitress was taking 10-15 minutes at a time getting to us. We first asked for a box, that took almost 20 minutes. And we were so disappointed at that point, we just wanted to pay and get out. Because of the lack of service at the end, we didn't tip much at all. And the food was nothing special, only the hushpuppies were amazing.

One more thing to mention: they seriously need to renovate. We sat at a booth, and there was a big gap between the end of the table and the wall. The walls were also green and yellow and looked like they haven't been painted in years. The pictures were so tiny and looked like they belonged in a restroom. And the decor was just... outdated. 

I'm not sure if we'll be back. Maybe in like 5 or more years if I happen to remember it."}
{"text":"I've eaten in twice, eaten take-out here several times.  The food I can't fault.  It's tasty, even taking it home, and I don't think any fish camp could match it.  Seriously, if you want take out fish, this IS the place, bar none.  

The reason it loses two stars is the seating inside the restaurant.  One time we went we were put in a smaller dining room and the experience was very pleasant.  Enough room between tables and we could hear each other from across the table.  The other time we ate in the main dining room and HOLY CARP!  You can't hear yourself think!  The tables are stacked one on top of the other, and it makes you think that every person in Fort Mill is hearing impaired, because there's a LOT of shouting and hideously loud talking in that room!  I had such a headache when I left the actual enjoyment of the food had been long lost.  I think I'll stick to take out from now on and save on the Advil!  I've been in crowded fish camps before and NONE of them were as intolerable as the main dining room at Captain Steve's!"}
{"text":"Great food and if you leave hungry, it's your own fault. They are very busy on typical busy days (weekends, friday) so plan to wait then. Varied menu and all in all a good seafood place.

Thanks"}
{"text":"This place was terrible and I will not be back. We went for a family members birthday and we were there for at least 2 hours. There were 5 adults and 2 kids in our group and it took forever to get our food. They forgot our beer and then gave us the wrong ones. Then the checks were messed up and that was a huge ordeal that no one seemed to figure out how to fix it. The food was just okay."}
{"text":"This is horrible food. The seafood doesn't taste fresh it tastes frozen. I'm not a fan"}
{"text":"Good 'Ol fish fry! Everything is great, plates are huge. Hush puppies are out of this world! Where elastic pants"}
{"text":"last night saturday sept 23 2017 i went to captain steve  with a party of 22 around 7:00 p.m,  after waiting for over a hour to be seated some of my guest decided to leave( i mind you we made reservation 5 days in advance)   the staff was disorganized .  we were seated in 3 different sections apart from each other, the manager was so very rule and disrespectful along with her sloppy attitude.  i found her to be very unprofessional.  other then that the food was good."}
{"text":"This was my first \"Fish Camp\" experience and overall I thought it was pretty decent. I made the mistake of checking out the Yelp reviews after I ordered my small fried shrimp platter. Someone posted a photo of the shrimp that were not deveined  which  I could have gone without seeing. I tried to suck it up because the shrimp were miniature so I would imagine most of the time they are not deveined but the breading hides it. Anyway, I survived and the shrimp tasted just fine. The cocktail sauce was good and spicy, and side-note, they serve awesome ranch dressing. 

Overall the food was pretty good and super plentiful ..the small platter (around $8.50) easily made two meals.  

Where they fell off for me was cleanliness. The place just felt dirty....basically everything on the table seemed to have a thin layer of grease on it.  I know it's tough when serving fried food to keep menus and tables clean, but when large crumbs fall out of the menu that's a good sign they need a little scrubbin. 

The service was on the slower side but they were busy splitting bills for a large birthday party. Overall we were happy with our server and this wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"The food here was very good and the crab legs are even better. Our waitress was so nice and friendly she made it worth coming back for. The wait wasn't that long to me but if you want your food cooked fresh and hot I don't mind waiting. Be prepared for a lot of food my husband and I shared a plate and it was enough for both of us."}
{"text":"If you're from out of the area avoid this place. We had high hopes because the reviews didn't look too bad and the pictures looked ok. But let me tell you it was an experience to remember. One member of our party had his soda refilled with another half full cup, while the rest of us got new cups with fresh soda. All the food tasted like it was frozen and microwaved. They did not take any plates the entire time and our table was full. The order was taken on a checklist and she did not remember what dressing we had. I could go on and on. No one ate even half of our food. Please save the money and avoid Captain cheapskate Steve's."}
{"text":"Finally, after so many years my family and I made it to Captain Steve's. To be honest, the main reason we never went when my family was in town was mainly because they don't serve beer. Hey! Don't judge.

We did enough day drinking so we figured it was time. Nope, not then either. So dang busy we couldn't even get in the door.

Take Two: The very next evening. Less people but still busy. The entrance is kind of confusing. They want people to split at the entrance based on how many are in their party.

Complimentary hush puppies await your presence. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and was pretty good overall. He was patient too because it took us quite some time to make a decision. There is so much stuff on the menu it is crazy. It covers so many different cravings. Steak, chicken and seafood.. oh my.

I enjoyed my steak with side of grilled shrimp with a side salad and collards. The plate came out loaded down (as you can see) with a roll, an onion ring and more hush puppies. Meat was cooked as requested and tasted good. In fact, everything tasted good.

We were indeed pleased with our visit."}
{"text":"There really aren't that many fish camps left in Charlotte proper. Heck, there aren't that many of anything left in Charlotte proper. We're too busy clearing out everything to build something else to keep anything, much less the lonely fish camp. But Steve's is a reasonable facsimile of a fish camp. To get anything better you have to make a decent drive, to for us city dwellers, it will do just fine.

Most fish camps get rather busy, especially on the weekends, and Steve's is no different there. Pull into the lot at the wrong time and you will think you were left off the guest list to the family reunion. This place can get busy.

Still, it is not much of a secret that the best days of Steve's are likely behind it. As enjoyable as they are, mounds and mounds of fried food are just not as appetizing as they once were, and don't tell anyone, but just as Charlotte refuses to hold onto anything from the past, we are also not exactly a hotbed for seafood. Do not be dismayed, however. Wear your pajama jeans or unbuckle your belt, shimmy into the booth and partake in the glory of the oil-basted goodness as you feel your arteries harden.

Then eat salads for the next few weeks."}
{"text":"The food was done well however most of the good offerings here are fried food. Very hectic environment not a cozy place to go eat. I would come here for a quick meal or pickup."}
{"text":"Me and wifey ate here last night. She ordered the Java Jeff Salad with Shrimp and I had a pick 3 with Perch, Chicken Fingers and Jumbo Shrimp. Like always the food was good but IMO the servings seem to have gotten smaller. If you are a seafood lover you will LOVE this place. When you pull up to the restaurant sometimes the amount of people waiting is overwhelming but they get you seated pretty fast."}
{"text":"After about 4 attempts to eat here without waiting forever, we finally got in.  Service was super friendly, although not the most attentive in the world.  The kids' portions were HUGE-they could easily have shared a plate.  My small catfish plate was a huge portion as well-it was well-prepared and quite tasty.  

Still not entirely sure why it's slammed and on a wait non-stop every day, except that Harrisburg loves her fried seafood.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"A W E S O M E ! ! ! ! !  This place rocks.  We are from out of town and stopped by to have a fish camp experience.  WOW, delicious!!  We had the fried oysters, broiled fish and fried scallops.  You WILL NOT be disappointed in this restaurant.  It was so busy, too- great to see a local \"camp\" being so loved by it's patrons."}
{"text":"let me start out by saying the amount of food they give you is awesome! the food is good and its not that expensive. there aren't too many places I go to and don't finish my plate. I seriously took a whole plate home (plus i don't typically eat leftovers) and ate the rest later that night. It was nice and clean and the atmosphere was nice. there was a birthday party going on so everyone was pretty chipper, they sang the birthday song. lol i was kind of excited too. 

Now here comes the bad part  (Idk why I've been having all these bad experiences....) for whatever reason the waitress was MIA the whole time we were there other than when she brought the food out. She didn't check up on us but maybe 1 time. Another waitress brought me soda then she came like 15mins later with a soda and had an attitude with me..i'm like but where have u been? lol it was not crowded in there and there were plenty of staff to assist. 

But hey I left with a full stomach anyway. lol"}
{"text":"I really want Charlotte to win in the food game. So far, they're hitting one out of every ten out of the park (Aria being that \"one.\" Their fettuccine carbonara with shrimp is SO bomb). The rest are just.....

I came here because my deddy swore it was the sh*t. I see now that my deddy is a liar and I now question everything he's ever told me to date.

Let me say this: the food wasn't horrible. It just wasn't cooked properly (super mushy scallops, light skinned breading on everything, etc). Additionally, I'm not sure who the owners are (and by who, I mean \"do Black people own this establishment? Are Black folks in charge of the kitchen?\"), but I'd love to have a looksy at their seasoning cabinet. Assuming that there even was one, I'd guess it was locked and they lost the key today because it was as bland as a face with improperly filled eyebrows. I get that you don't want to overdo the seasoning due to preferences but when I eat fish, I want fish with a kick. When I eat shrimp, I want shrimp with some umph. When I eat oysters, I want oysters with pizazz. See where I'm going here? If you're ferociously shaking your head \"no\" to brother salt, sister pepper, deaconess garlic powder, and elder Old Bay, you end up offering a plate situation similar to jumping in the ocean and biting Nemo in the ass, then tossing the remains at patrons. Not nice, Steve. Not nice at all.

Again, the food isn't horrible. It just needed more. More seasoning, more time in the grease, more umph."}
{"text":"Service was good. Fried oysters were good while a little bland. I had the grilled shrimp and scallops and they were ok. We ordered the fried flounder to split just to see what all the hubbub was about and it was meh. The coating on the fish was more breaded than battered. The prices were great and the restaurant is very popular. I'd  go again and try something different next time."}
{"text":"Came to this establishment on August 12, 2017 at 3:30 p.m. with my family after a Funeral/ Memorial Service for my cousin. There was confusion from the very beginning. First, my Aunt was told they reserved rooms for large parties. However, through miscommunication from the establishment she wasn't informed that they wouldn't hold a room on Fridays or Saturdays. Second, they (namely an extremely arrogant and rude Pacific Islander/Hawaiian hostess) caused further insult to injury when 'informing us' that our family couldn't remain seated together.. 

We were a party of 25. Apparently, they have a policy that prevents seating more than 20 individuals together. We were told they did not want to back the kitchen up, and wanted to keep the noise level down (Although, it was already loud in the establishment). We explained we were willing to break the checks up per table and order as any other separately seated parties, and we aren't a loud family anyway. However, they refused to seat our family together and 5 of our family members had to eat alone. Two additional family members were so upset they decided to leave the establishment altogether. There were several empty seats, near our table. The restaurant wasn't filled to capacity. However, due to the \"policy\" we couldn't remain together....even after explaining that we left a funeral, was originally told we could have a section, and the restaurant was empty. 

On top of it all, when I was forced to order by my Aunt (it was her son that passed away, so it was \"her\" day) the food was just 'okay'. The fish and oysters were fried very hard. The homemade lemonade tasted like it was out of a store. The hushpuppies were actually pretty good. If it were my choice, I would've taken all 25 of my family members and gave another establishment my money. I won't be returning...ever.


Parking Lots was spacious. 
Food Priced Reasonable  $8.95-$20; but it was only 'okay'."}
{"text":"BEWARE of your check and their gratuity process!  Our waitress (Aimee) actually took the 18% PLUS our cash tip of 9.00 even when we told her TWICE not to debit the credit card!  Complained to Manager (Kathy) and she actually said she would \"ask the waitress to give back\"!!! A large establishment and they cant make a MANAGEMENT decision to provide 9.00 back???????????????"}
{"text":"Captain Steve's has been a family favorite since they first opened, Everything I have ever had there is great, after looking at some of the reviews I decided to write one and comment on a few things, Captain Steve's is a Fish camp style Restaurant, which seems to be a southern thing..  Things you can count on from a fish camp style is huge portions, as much hushpuppies as you want, good tea,  and a family friendly environment, with lots of people... On weekends you will find lots of families & groups celebrating this & that or just getting together for dinner.. It isn't a quiet intimate type place.   If part of your party doesn't eat fish they have that covered... If you go on the weekend it is crowed and the servers are working hard, and even though they get your food ot fast, patience is a good thing to bring with you..."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from a North Carolina fish camp. Great fried seafood, killer hush puppies and Cheerwine. Obvious choice was the Captain's Platter after I had already scarfed down a basket of hush puppies with honey butter. Fried flounder, scallops, jumbo shrimp, oysters, callbash shrimp and a crab cake was piled high on the plate. The fried oysters were the star but the scallops were solid too. So much food I couldn't eat it all. The Captain knows what he is doing!"}
{"text":"Very reliable, you can count on excellent seafood, large portions and reasonable prices. Keep in mind the acoustics are loud, so don't expect to have quiet conversations. The waitress said they don't serve alcohol but the website says \"Now serving beer and wine.\" So a little confusion there. Otherwise a very satisfying meal and experience. They do a busy take-out business too."}
{"text":"I've been going to this \"fish camp\" for years.  

It's like a HUGE 2 dining room building...very open with tall ceilings...lots of tables and booths.  

During prime time hours, it can get really busy with lots of \"INTERESTING PEOPLE\" to look at.  

Menu has typical seafood items grilled, broiled and fried.  Shrimp, Scallops, Clam Strips, Oysters, Crab Legs, Lobster etc.  They also have great side salads with Bacon, Cheese, croutons, cucumber erc.  The dressings are super good.  PORTIONS ARE INCREDIBLY HUGE!  The \"small fried shrimp\" platter is enough to feed 2 people.  

They also have some pastas like Lasagna, Spaghetti, Fettuccine.  They have Burgers, BBQ, and Steaks (which i prolly wouldnt try a steak here).  Side items are FF, Homeade Onion Rings, Slaw, Broccoli, and other things like that.  

Varied menu for sure. I have tried most things at least once....and i would say that they obviously do seafood the best...and the fettuccine is a close second.  The rest, i could take it or leave it.

One pet peeve of mine, (which some people seem to enjoy) is that they have a \"singing waitress\".  The woman can sing gospel like none other, but shes so damn loud and disruptive. ...it really gets on my nerves....and it distracts all the servers from doing their job efficientally. Save your sinnging and witnessing for the church house.....not the seafood house.  She really does it for the attention and when she gets done singing....she then races through the dining room drawing attention to herself by acting all panicked that shes got to catch up on her tables and get back to work.  VERY DRAMATIC.  UGH!  People record video of her...and im sure she is waiting on a video to go Viral so she can get a \"big break\".   I think i may have one or two in my phone as well...guilty.

All in all, this place will be a regular stop for me simply because when i eat out....i dont always want the typical Plaza Midwood selections....or a coorperate meal....this is a way to switch it up.

Definitely not a 5 star experience, food is a 4 star experience,.....but the singing waitress brings it to a 3 star for me."}
{"text":"I generally do not eat fried shrimp or scallops as they are often breaded too much and not proportionate to the respective \"meat\" its surrounding. The scallops here were very lightly breaded and the amount received for the amount spent screamed value. The speed of service and staff was very friendly. By the way, that sweet tea was perfectly balanced and flavored. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"It was almost exactly what I was expecting... I grew up going to fish camps on rivers and lakes, this one is slightly more \"posh\" than what I was used to.  They were quite busy with large parties, I'm sure that's common on Sunday's.  I had the pick two, flounder and shrimp.  The portions were large and the flounder was excellent.  The shrimp was a little too salty for my taste.  Their iced tea was excellent.  The wait staff stayed busy, my drink was never empty and the food came out quickly.  

My only complaint would be that the place was quite loud, but there were a lot of people in there.

It was worth the drive from Charlotte!  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wife ordered some snapper, they screwed up the order but said they would immediately make some more. 40 minutes later after everyone else is done eating and every single person in the restaurant has had their order completed, it finally shows up. Waitress was making up excuses and basically said \"I told my manager, it's out of my hands now.\"  She didn't come back to check on us for 15 minutes. Very disappointed with the quality of service. Probably wouldn't come back again until the manager and waitress was replaced. Seems to be hit or miss on service. Food is okay but not worth the hassle we encountered."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  First of all the theme of the restaurant and decoration is great, it makes you feel like you're near the ocean! The staff is extremely friendly and service is extremely fast and you get your food pretty quickly even when it's busy.   The platers are really well priced for the amount of food you get.  Leftovers for dayz.  If you're looking to be healthy the steamed platter comes with a delicious salad. I however like all of the fried things in the world and decided to get a pick three fried platter.  I got the fried popcorn shrimp, fried big shrimp, and the fried scallops.  My food came out on a plate and it was stacked high which reminded my family of a place we went in Maine when we would visit all the time.  The quality of the food was great!  It really made me feel like I was at a beach restaurant.  You also get free hush puppies with your meal and they're AMAZING.  Make sure you try this place!"}
{"text":"Went on the clients recommendation. Loved the hush puppies and our server Kiki. She did a great job! My portions were huge!! Loved my food and everything else. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Went to Captain Steve's for lunch today.  The service was great, the food came fast, even though we slightly customized it.  The food was excellent and we had no complaints of any kind.  This was our first time and we will now be regulars."}
{"text":"Cheap, generously portioned, and deliciously deep fried. This restaurant is huge and busy almost all the time. There's a line for small parties and another one for larger parties. There's a wide selection of fried or broiled seafood. Most get the fried. You can make your own or order off the regular combos. You really can't go wrong with anything you order here. The food is always fresh and the service always responsive. Would recommend."}
{"text":"So we've been eating at Capitan Steve's for a few years when the seafood hankering takes hold. They're neck-and-neck with Mayflower in terms of quality, taste, price and quantity.

We always order call-ahead take out to avoid the wait in both the takeout and sitting areas. We typically place the order at least 15 minutes in advance. 

The food is always hot and fresh--never cold. The portions are ample with some to spare.  I always get the fried seafood. The flavor tends to be on the lackluster side and requires some doctoring (Old Bay and Ketchup) to make it good. 

I typically order the jumbo shrimp and clam strips as they are my favorites. 

Overall a good place to stop in if you're in the area and want seafood but not a destination per se."}
{"text":"The portions here are enormous, the food is good, and the staff is great! We enjoy cooking here as a family. It is huge on the inside."}
{"text":"OMG this place is disgusting . My broiled shrimp was not fully cooked , the collards tasted canned , the broccoli was mushy , my son's Alfredo was cold and congealed . I just don't even feel like listing all the tasteless , old oil , deep fried dishes we were brought .  

They didn't even peel the onion for the blooming onion ... should've turned around as soon as we saw the \"under new management sign \" waited 2 hours, due to sloooooow , i mean super duper sloooooow service ! Also the kitchen took forever to prepare the food , only for me to send it back and I am leaving without eating anything bc I'm afraid to ."}
{"text":"??? did you follow me, to see if I was gonna do it.. Well... I've done it.

This is another place that my job at the time used often. We would have about 8 orders from my job at the time.

I almost wanna write 2 reviews so the place could get 10 stars from me. 

I love this place. (check the open and closing time).
This place has been around for a many years. Actually has a 2nd location. 
Everytime I speak on this place, I tell ppl that they will bring you a TO-GO BOX when they bring your food out b/c YOU WILL NOT finish the food. 

Salt & Pepper fish, shrimp

Not sure why in the south ordering Tea is heard as... \"PLEASE BRING ME BROWN SUGAR WATER...PLEASE...PLEASE\"... no biggie, its the norm around these parts. No knock on this place. 

I always get the Create you Combo... 3 for (I forgot how much) instead of the Create Your Own 2 for (I forgot how much) your choice of BROILED, FRIED, BLACKEND
Different choices of Fish, Scallops, Oysters, Shrimp,

Scallops are huge, Oysters are ummm OysterY

Hushpuppies are good... (I usually only eat 3 or 4...don't want to get full off fried bread balls)

-----   Only knock on this place is the PARKING LOT.......... ROCKS/DIRT. I just washed my car, all shiny and sparkley, tires lookin wet...UNTILLLLLLLLLLL!!!! EKK EKKK EKKKKK
I hit the parking lot. 

This location in S.C. probably offers MORE food to plate ratio. (since its the original location). I often ordered the Crab Legs to go from the SC location. I'll think I'll write a review on the other location as well.

{"text":"All kids meals are fried except the pasta marinara. No substitutions. Plan on buying an adult meal for your kids if you want to give them something a little healthier."}
{"text":"If you want a lot of fried fish at a cheap price, this is your spot. Nothing to write home about but good food. Always fast and friendly. Plenty of space for large groups."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time after driving past the extremely full parking lot most nights and thanks to other Yelpers' reviews.  My roommate and I had a craving for some seafood and boy was this our place!  Luckily, we got there before the parking lot was full and were seated very promptly.  I had read positive things about their small hush puppies, but didn't realize you get them as soon as you sit down.  They were definitely addicting and great to snack on as we perused the menu and waited for our food.  I got the small baby shrimp platter (fried) with a baked potato.  This was by far more than enough food for me and my roommate to split and possibly bring home leftovers still!  I can't imagine what the large is like.  My baked potato was delicious, as was the small creamy cole slaw that comes as a side.  The baby shrimp were bountiful and also delicious - I'm a big fan of cocktail sauce so I enjoyed that as well.  My roommate had the fried captain's platter and nothing but good things to say, again it was more than enough food to share.  Prices are very reasonable, especially for the portions.  Service was very friendly all around and they have plenty of wait staff to take care of you!  

All around great experience, I look forward to returning in the future and possibly trying something from their broiled menu too!"}
{"text":"Huge, packed, bustling place good for families. FRIED seafood place, like at the beach. Fattening but a great fun splurge. Extremely fast service."}
{"text":"Nope, won't go back. I don't know who these people are that are claiming this place has great seafood, it's simply standard fried seafood, some good some bad. The hushpuppies were really good, so was the potato salad and the tartar sauce. The Shrimp cocktail was the weirdest looking swhite, tastelsss shrimp ever. We got some platter that had popcorn shrimp, very iodiny, fried scallops, fried oyster, and deviled crab, with no crab that I can decipher in there. The only seafood item that was good was the flounder and it came in a huge piece. Never again. This place is ok for a cheap, low quality seafood meal."}
{"text":"This place is average at best. They have a full parking lot all the time but I honestly don't think it's that good."}
{"text":"My hunni bun brought me here over the weekend. I've heard about it but had never been. The serving sizes were pretty filling. those hush puppies are to die for. I ate so many I barely wanted my food. I had the stuffed crab, scallops and jumbo shrimp. The stuffed crab was just ok but everything else good as well as the Cole slaw. I liked it,  it wasn't to crowded. Though I hear lunch time it can be very crowded."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. From start to finish. Hush puppies and honey butter are the best. Portions are huge and service is great. You will be taking food home. Better go hungry."}
{"text":"Today i had the salt and pepper flounder, baby shrimp,stuffed crab, with onion rings as a side. I enjoyed my seafood. The salt and pepper flounder was seasoned to perfection! The baby shrimp were delicious and not excessively greasy like in some restaurants. The only thing i didn't love were the onion rings. They were very bland...like extremely bland. So i will not be ordering those again. Our server was great. She was patient and was knowledgeable of the menu. There were a few errors regarding the food that she fixed immediately. The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars are those onion rings...don't get them! Other than that, check them out."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from a feeding machine like this. In and out, mostly fried food. Fried food is a staple of the south but this fried food was over breaded and just ok. Waited 45 min for our FRIED food. (Really?) Waitress seemed new but clueless. Probably won't be back but if your looking for good hang over food. This is your place. It is also inexpensive."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for lunch today. We both tried the clam chowder, which although pretty tasty,  was thin and the carrots and potato were under cooked. I tried the Alaskan Whitefish and the salt and pepper catfish fillet. Both were tasty, but there was enough oil to puddle on the bottom of my plate. I tried the onion rings and found them to be large and without much flavor.  The problem with the coleslaw is that they chop the cabbage too finely and it turns out more like a mush than a salad. The worst part was, even though the parking lot was almost empty, it took longer waiting in line to pay the bill than it did to eat the meal Would I go back? Yeah...the next time I have an overwhelming desire to listen to my arteries harden  while I ate!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Seafood. The fish and shrimp are delicious. I'd like to recommend the hush puppies. They are huge but so good they will fill you up before your meal gets there."}
{"text":"Food is getting smaller and smaller ,alot of hush puppies .The prices higher and higher"}
{"text":"This place is great , I recently tried the lobster tails a bit pricey , so I thought , until I got my plate there were not 2 , but 3 lobster tails and the were big , and delicious, we go anytime we want lobster that's definitely the place to go ."}
{"text":"The BEST seafood restaurant that I've been to in a while, hands down! I had the opportunity to order some take out and it was delicious! 

I highly recommend the Jumbo Shrimp and the Cole Slaw! 

Hopefully next time I'm in the area I will eat inside of  the restaurant. It seemed like a very popular family restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for my grandma's birthday. We had a great time. There was a bit of confusion with the reservation I had made prior but everything worked out in the end. Have to come back for Tuesdays all-you-can-eat crab legs"}
{"text":"Huge portions and great service. Their salads are ice cold and refreshing. I just wish they served crab cakes- only offer deviled crab."}
{"text":"Went to Captain Steve's for a birthday party, a big birthday party. There were about 75 of us in a separate room. Our service was excellent and the food was very good. My husband & I got the small order of shrimp and should have split it.  This was the small order! It was huge and I took half home for another meal. Also, one of my friends ordered the side salad which looked so good I wished I had ordered it but had way too much food already. Not your average side salad! Not your average seafood restaurant. Excellent!
No complaints!"}
{"text":"Captain Steve's definitely knows how to provide seafood! We recently moved to the area and were looking for a new place to go. We tried another place and it just wasn't as good as our old places.. 

We have been twice and have had excellent service and food! The scallops are to die for. I have never had any better and they even out beat the ones that I got fresh in Florida. The jumbo shrimp are actually jumbo shrimp and they are so good. The onion rings are freshly made and wonderful! 

The only drawback is that they definitely can get busy but that is a good thing. Just remember to prepare for a wait. We were a table of 2 and given 25 minute wait but ended up getting sat in less than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Mound of brown.  Go with those words.

Was wondering if everything is made from scratch here, and was told yes.

Had the 3 combo platter of fried clamp strips, fried oysters, and fried scallops.  A huge mound of brown was brought out, that included hush puppies and onion rings.  Onion rings weren't impressive.  Seemed like a thin coating of cornmeal.  Everything else was good, but could barely eat 1/2 of the platter.

Reason is I had the raw oysters as an appetizer, and presentation was sub par, but I didn't care b/c they gave me 14 oysters shucked and placed onto lettuce for $5.95.  All I had to do was dab some cocktail sauce and eat.

Had the oyster stew, and it was poor.  A few fresh oysters in a light cream soup.  Not what I expected.  The clam chowder tasted OK.

The 2 combo platter with the fish filet gives you two huge filets.

Prompt service and a good mix of black and white folks enjoying the grub here."}
{"text":"Food is for the most part is awesome, the staff on the other hand is obnoxious and rude! They need training in edicat in my opinion. If you hate your job that much, go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Captain Steve's never fails to deliver perfectly cooked seafood in mass quantities every time we come.  We've been 3 times and usually order broiled scallops with fried jumbo shrimp.  Very few restaurants, including high end establishments, can properly cook sea scallops, but Captain Steve's does every time!  It's impressive.  Even the shrimp is fried to perfection.  What impresses me most is there is always a huge wait to get in every time we've been, which is a sign that it's good.  If you are a party of 4 or less, there is a separate, much shorter line inside, and you'll get right in.  The service is always great, attentive, and fast.  For a restaurant off the beaten path, they do it right and always deliver on quality."}
{"text":"Capt Steve's is awesome!! The hush puppies are excellent!! A little sweet and perfectly crispy! The fried salt n pepper boneless catfish, fried baby shrimp, and grilled shrimp are all delicious! The grilled chicken garden salad is great also. They are very consistent with the quality  of their food. I KNOW I'm going to get exactly what I expect every time:) Service is always friendly and quick:)"}
{"text":"Throwback to an earlier era. Basic, large place with no real ambience. I knew that in advance but still decided to try for lunch (weekday- not crowded) because I had a yearning for fried scallops. 

Was quite surprised at how delicious they were. There were 8 good-sized pieces on my platter ($10.95, including iced tea and one side, plus good hush puppies) and scallops were tender and succulent. (Can't believe I'm using these words and giving a 4-star review given my recent 2-star one for a noted Charleston restaurant.)  I was told that the scallops were fresh. Tasted that way. 

The other meal was fried jumbo shrimp. Also very good.  One side item was served cold but they reheated it. Can't speak to what service would be like on a weekend if crowded, but certainly friendly and competent at our lunch. 

One could spend $6-$7 for lunch- pretty cheap. I just picked out a more expensive choice."}
{"text":"I  had passed by Captain Steve's on several occasions and always remarked I wanted to try it out. My wife and I did this past weekend, and it was definitely worth the trip from South Charlotte.

The decor is simplistic but definitely works in their favor - it has more of a \"fish camp\" feel to it. The food is excellent but the portions are way too large for any one person, which amazingly enough is the only thing I didn't care for. My wife and I could easily have shared a plate, and will probably do so in the future.

Good comfort food here. My catfish filets were light and flavorful, and my wife's blackened flounder, she told me, was outstanding. The hushpuppies are to die for. Definitely plan on taking home portions for later!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of their broiled dishes, came out with Oil all over the plate, not really appealing. Left unsatisfied and blah. Wish their had a better section on healthy seafood dishes."}
{"text":"I love Captain Steve's. The customer service is always through the roof. I love the salt and peppered catfish. The hush puppies and tea..... Soooo good! Captain Steve's will remain a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice with coworkers. They have great food with great prices for lunch. Their lunch portions are honestly dinner sized portions. My coworkers and myself always utilize take out plates back to the office. The dining area is huge! Bathrooms are right near the front when you first walk in. 

The only thing that I cannot stand is that for the popular two lunch specials (combinations), you cannot order scallops. I even asked the server if I can get them if I paid extra. I was told that I would have to order a bigger platter (the captain platter I think) that costs about $3 and offers less food items. I honestly don't understand that policy. If I want the combination platter am willing to pay extra, why can I not order some damn scallops? The captain platter gives more fishy options while I prefer scallops, shrimp, and clam strips. 

I did order the bigger platter on my second visit just for the scallops and was underwhelmed. There weren't enough for a scallop lover (maybe 5 averaged sized scallops) and I don't really like fish but I had to get it. 

They have good food overall and a good environment (kitchen times, servers, decor) so I can see myself returning with the coworkers. I would not return on my personal time... when I want my way and am willing to pay for the extra scallops, I should be able to order what I want, how I want it."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped at this restaurant after seeing its reviews on Google (4.5/5). Our party of six were seated immediately. The waitstaff was quick and efficient-they run in pairs for a particular section of the restaurant ensuring fast service. We placed our orders (two Hamburger steak meals, one grilled chicken meal, one child's cheese pizza, one small Baby Shrimp platter, and one Alaskan Whiting platter) and received the entire order in about five minutes. The meals came with a gigantic House salad and complementary hush puppies, which were fresh and delicious. All of the food was hot, freshly made, of quality, and yummy! No one finished their plates because there was soooo much food!  The prices are amazing: six people ate for around $70 with drinks included. Definitely worth the visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Best calabash style - fried seafood house in or around town. Get here early and expect a short wait to get a table. Once you are stated, you will not wait long for delicious hush puppies followed by great big giant plates of fried seafood! 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Love Captain Steves! Reasonably priced and good! The salad is crisp and fresh, hush puppies are awesome and entrees are great. The stuffed crab is tasty and fish is cooked perfectly. It is always busy but we get seated immediately....buuut, there is usually a little wait for the food. Luckily they bring a basket of their delicious hush puppies as soon as you sit down and salads are brought out quickly. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"great deal. Exactly what you'd expect-- delicious fried shrimp/fish platters, cole slaw, hush puppies. Amazing prices."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating inside and the experience was bad. We first got seated all the way in the back where servers and bust boys stood around talking there were plenty of other seats we could've had. We got our server Tiffani P...and she seemed like she didn't want to assist us. She took our order and we didn't see her until we were leaving. We needed corrections in our order and needed extra condiments and we had to ask bust boys and other servers to help because Tiffani was too busy helping other tables. I don't know if it was because we're black that our server couldn't serve us. My grandma was here visiting and we wanted to take her to what we thought was a family local spot and we were disappointed. Also the plates were wayyy to small for a pile full of food...please upgrade them. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I remember the first time someone brought me to Captain Steve's...I didn't really think to much of it; thought it would most likely taste like the Mayflower.  I was pleasantly surprised when they brought out my plate.  I ordered the baby shrimp w/fries and they were literally overflowing from the plate.  When we eat here we always have food left over for about two days. I ususally order the shrimp (baby or jumbo) and the bf always orders the catfish strips (salt and peppered).  The one thing that you'll remember is how fresh the food taste (and how much of it you get).  The flavor is full but not overpowering and the prices are fairly decent.  I've been when it was slow and when it was at full compacity but not once did I ever have to really wait for my food nor compromise good service.  For the two of us (one drink and one water w/lemon) our bill ususally come to about $24.00 (taxes included).

I also want to mention that they bring you out a basket of homemade hushpuppies with honey butter (complimentary) and they bring you out even more with your order.  They are delishious!  I also enjoy their homemade tarter sauce (just the right amout of horseradish sauce), its not too bitter or sweet.  It's already on your table along with shrimp cocktail so you can use as much as you like and not have to worry about asking the server to keep bringing you more. 

The only down side to this place is that it's not open on Sundays and Mondays.  I found out the hard way by driving from the University side of Charlotte to Fort Mill South Carolina only to discover it was closed.  I know that there is also one off of Independence but for some reason I'm partial to only going to this one.

If you want fresh seafood, a nice helping, at a good price...then I truly recommend giving this place a try...you want be dissappointed :)"}
{"text":"Good food, very casual dinning atmosphere, excellent service. This place does a great business.  When we arrived, the parking lot was very busy. When we got inside, there were about 30 people in line, but they had us seated in less than 10 minutes. The staff couldn't have been friendlier and our experience overall was excellent. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been on the search for an amazing seafood place I think I may have found it, but I want to try Mayflower Seafood Restaurant before I say I'm totally in love with this place.  

Me and my girlfriend went here a couple of nights ago. When we came in and was seated I felt like it took unusually long for us to meet our waiter.  We were waiting for like 5-10mins. I understand she may have been busy, but I still think a hey I'll be your waiter I'll be with you in just a few minutes would've been okay. (My girlfriend just said I'm being impatient lol) but when she finally did come she brought us hush puppies (I love good HUSHPUPPIES) they came with honey butter and they were unlimited that right there already had me in awe. So I ordered my Fishermans Platter and my girl who isn't a fan of seafood ordered The     Grilled Chicken with a salad.  Her salad came with in minutes. I felt like our actual entrees took forever too come but our waitress kept our drinks full which I loved :) and she kept the HUSHPUPPIES coming.  The hushpuppies aren't the best in the world but ehhh I felt like they were a bit too hard for me and somewhat bland. Would've liked them to be more flavorful and fluffy . But after what seemed like 30-45 mins we finally  got out entrees.  My plate was stacked with fried everything I was amazed it was a lot of food for 17.99. I had jumbo shrimp which was great. Baby shrimp. A crab, oyster .  Everything on that plate was DELICIOUS!! And it was a lot I barely finished half before I had to call it in and get a container. OHH and the baked potato was good and well prepared wasn't all beat up and thrown in foil paper lol. And Hailee loved the chicken she said she wasn't expecting it to be soo good since it's a seafood joint but she let me get a bite and it was nice very very nice juicy and flavorful!!  I loved it all.

Overall, Food was amazing  service was mediocre.  I would definitely come back again!!! I want to try the Mayflower Seafood joint to see how it compares."}
{"text":"Every time I have eaten at this restaurant, the food has been without a doubt outstanding! The portions are amazing the fish is done to perfection and of course they've got the best hush puppies in the world. Their Ice-T is also some of the best I've tasted in the area. The service is always exemplary!"}
{"text":"The service could have been much better and the food was tasteless. My calamari was awful. Their were a few other dishes that was served tthat could have been better. Maybe it was a bad night but I will never know because I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Captain Steve's is the place to go for very large portions of quality fried seafood. My go to dish is the Fried Catfish Strips but on my most recent visit I also had the Fried Baby Shrimp. The Fried Catfish were flakey and flavorful with crispy breading and the Baby Shrimp were tender and crispy. I had the \"small\" portion which I could not finish. The hush puppies are also very good."}
{"text":"Three of us ate there on Sunday 9/6/15. Two of us ordered the seafood platter. The other ordered cooked shrimp. The platters were just ok. The scallops tasted gritty which means they were not rinsed well enough. The entire platter was seasoned with a mixture of spices, which was, at times, overwhelming. The small popcorn shrimp was good but the large shrimp was cooked too long as they were tough. The stuffed crab was very good, while the flounder & oysters were terrible. The hush puppies were the highlight of the meal. The salad was very good & the sweet potato was good except there was an upcharge for selecting it. It was served with cinnamon & honey butter. The French fries were selected on the other two meals & they were just ok. Two of us had tea, which was very good, and the other had coke. 
Service was ok but it could have been better. The girl brought our check & just plopped it on the table never asking if we needed anything else & she left. We had to flag her down to ask for a box. The noise level was horrible especially the table of 6 near us. They were so loud you could not talk over them. When they left we finally were able to talk but the level of noise was still loud. 
Overall, I would not return to this restaurant again. Too much was wrong with the food & service to spend $56.00 again."}
{"text":"If you want fried entries (I.e., fish, shrimp, etc.) this is your place. Come early or late though because the wait for a table and your meal will be extensive. For example came here with a party of 9 at 6:30pm. Seated at 8:00, received meals at 8:50. 

Very loud inside. 

Staff is polite."}
{"text":"One of the best waitresses I've ever had works here! Her name was Eva & she MADE the experience. She was sweet from the second we sat down & she can SANG! She sang for he birthday celebrants & a couple of tables, including ours. Go on Thurs, Fri, & Sat because that's when she works. 

You get ALOT of food for the money you pay. & The hush puppies are SO good! I had the crab cakes with sweet potato. The potato was the half the size of my plate. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I really do not like to write a negative review, but, this time I cannot help it.  I was the last person to arrive in our large party of 23 people.  I seated myself within my group.  As soon as I sat down, I borrowed a menu from another person within our party.  I barely opened the menu when the waitress asked me if I know what I wanted.  I replied not yet, please come back.  She promptly took the other's dinner requests and never came back to me.  I was sitting calmly waiting for her to return.  When another person in the party realized that I had not ordered, they went to the waitress area and a waiter promptly came over and took my order.  No hard feelings, everyone can make a goof. The gentleman across from me ordered the same thing I had.  It looked good.  

My order was simple, chopped steak dinner, baked potato (extra butter, no sour cream), salad with french dressing.  The salad was fine,  the potato no extra butter, had sour cream.  The problem came in when I cut into the chopped steak, a combination of grease and blood came out onto my plate.  It was cold to the touch.  I sent it back.  In another 10 minutes a properly cooked steak, baked potato, garlic bread came out.  They also brought me out an order of Jumbo Shrimp that I did not want.  I passed that out to the others within my group.  When the bill came out, I noticed that a 20% tip was automatically added.  

Another man in the group ordered a loaded baked potato, it was just a normal baked potato.  The lady across the table said that she hoped that next year they chose a different restaurant.   I know ordering a chopped steak in a seafood restaurant may not be the best choice.  If it is on the menu, I expect it to edible.  I am sure that the chopped steak did not meet the minimum temperature requirements for safe service.  Sorry Captain Steve, I will not be back."}
{"text":"When the parking lot is full, that is a good sign! I ordered the large platter with clam strips, boiled jumbo shrimp and the catfish strips with onion rings. 

You better bring an appetite if you get the large platter. The catfish strips were a good size. The clam strips are breaded and you get a lot! The Sweet Tea was pretty good too!

The staff is friendly and welcoming. The restaurant is clean, there is adequate space between each table."}
{"text":"I had the worse experience at this restaurant, they made us wait for 1hour 1/2 then tried to bring the food after we said we don't want it because of the wait. They charged for food that we did not eat because of the wait and then called? the cops on me this horrible. I will never return to this place"}
{"text":"Happened to be in Harrisburg and stumbled upon Captain Steve's Seafood Sag on a Friday.    First impressions was a fairly large, stand-alone restaurant, large parking lot so they can accommodate a lot of folks (well cars and then folks inside).

We were pretty early (11:30 am) so it was a bit sparse inside as far as the lunch crowd, but as we were waiting/eating our meal, the booths and tables started filling up.

Our server was very nice and had a lot of recommendations.  The menu is really simple, but there are a lot of options and really you can customize your meal to how you want it (very accommodating).  As you wait on your meal to arrive, a basket of hush puppies are delivered to your table with butter.  They aren't the typical \"large\" hush puppies, more like bites and they are pretty addictive.  WARNING:  most likely you will get hush puppies with your meal also, but it's a good thing!

I tried the salt & pepper catfish.... and when it came out it was a mountain of food!  I opted to have a half & half fries and onion rings combo... Everything was cooked right.... (you can't really mess up fried food too badly)  but it was just WAY too much food.

To top it all off, the restaurant manager sent out a honking slice of dessert (they were trying out) to the first few lunch tables of the day.  IT was a strawberry shortcake.  Very good - not too sweet and a good way to end an already ginormous food outing.  Needless-to-say I was in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon and no work was accomplished at my office."}
{"text":"Captain Steve's is a great casual seafood place.  It's nothing fancy but you certainly get your money's worth here.  

When you order scallops, even with one of their platters, they give you several instead of 3 or 4 like some seafood places.  Same with everything else.  You can get it fried or broiled and they have all you can eat specials of crab legs.

I had a broiled platter including filet of flounder, scallops and grilled shrimp with a side of fries.  The worst thing in that group was the fries which were flavorless and could have been cooked longer.   The fish was good with 2 thinly sliced filets.  The shrimp was a little over seasoned for my tasted but it was cooked perfectly.  And the scallops were quite good.

Service is great here.  Everyone was so friendly and appreciative of your business.  The place is also huge so it can definitely handle larger groups.  And from what I understand, this place gets packed on weekends."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a zero star! I was in the mood for fish and decided to stop by. I had not been here in years, and should have known something was up, because the parking lot had about 5 cars in it. I ordered the small flounder with a side of fried okra to go. While waiting in the lobby an employee yelled \"I'm tired of being treated like sh$t!\"... My second warning... It took about 20 minutes to get my food. I should have checked it, but I didn't. When I got home(10 min drive)and pulled the box out, I noticed that the box was not warm.My entire meal was ice cold. The fish was very hard and the okra was like rubber. I called the manager immediately and informed her of the meal and the behavior of the employee. She apologized and offered to make it over. I told her \"no thank you!\" I will never complain about a meal and send it back, or let any restaurant prepare me another meal...I watch TV and YouTube! I charged the $10.00 loss to the game. This place use to be so good. I will never dine here again!"}
{"text":"This place looked very popular just from the amount of cars outside in the parking lot.  Inside however, they had plenty of room and sat us right away. 

They have a decent selection of fried/broiled fish along with some other meat selections as well.  (I'm just not one to order a steak at a place thats known for it's fried fish)

The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, we were quite pleased.

All of the food was pretty good, we had the broiled Alaskan Whitefish, Blackend Talipia, popcorn shrimp and the Mac and Cheese.  Everything overall was pretty good.

This is a great place to take the kids or a group to get your fried fish craving satisfied."}
{"text":"One of the best 'fish camps' I've patronized. My first experience was take-out. My friend suggested this place when I came to visit. During this visit to Charlotte, she asked if I was hungry and I requested the fish camp (couldn't remember the name). 

When we arrived we were seated immediately. The staff was very friendly. The restaurant is noisy but it's a fun noise. The food is seasoned well and the portions are huge! You will have leftovers. The hush puppies and honey spread are a treat. They should be a sin LOL. 

My friend will definitely enjoy my leftovers - it's another meal!"}
{"text":"I don't eat seafood, but they have great chicken and steak for anyone who doesn't like seafood! The place looks very cool on the inside as if you are at the beach. The hush puppies are to die for!!"}
{"text":"So yum
Fantastic wait staff, amazing portions, affordable prices. 
Always take home leftovers."}
