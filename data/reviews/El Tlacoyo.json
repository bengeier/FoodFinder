{"text":"I'm 101% Mexican and I love this place! 
Their food is so authentic que voy a terminar esta oración en español!"}
{"text":"Only positive to say about this place! (Okay maybe one mild negative, if you can call it that.) 
Their food is delightful, very spicy but definitely authentic. I went on a search after finding out what a tlacoyo was and found this gem. It's in a mini \"strip mall\" not really but that's all I got, next to a 7-11. You go for the food not the ambiance. 
Only downside was I am trying to learn Spanish and went in a spoke to the women on Spanish...not Spanglish, Spanish...and she would only respond to me on English. I wasn't trying to offend, I really just want to practice my skillz!
Check this place out if you're on the area, have a taste for spicy food and want real Mexican, not that chipotle filibertos garbage. Yum."}
{"text":"El Tlacoyo won't win any beauty pageants, which makes it my kind of place. They had a bunch of stuff on the menu that I wasn't familiar with, so I asked for some help and ended up getting the huarache con costilla. My order came out pretty quick and I promptly enjoyed the fiesta in my mouth for the next 20 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Great authentic mexican.  First time here and was very impressed.  A simple restaurant,  not very fancy decor,  service was very good and the food was fantastic.  They offer many dishes that you will not find in your traditional American Mexican restaurant. 

I asked the waitress to pick an appetizer and a main dish for me.  I really do not know what either was but both were extremely good.  

I would recommend being adventurous and trying something new."}
{"text":"Like the other reviewers have commented....I second their thoughts this is the Real Deal! El Tlacoyo gets 5 Stars for Best Tortas and Authentic Regional Mexican Food from the state of Hidalgo. 

I originally found about El Tlacoyo Located on the West-Mesa/Tempe border from a good friend many years ago who spoke fluent Spanish learned while serving as a missionary in Mexico. He said the food was awesome and is one of a kind or a hidden, Diamond in the rough! Found nowhere else in Phoenix!

To start with you will be the only Gringo's in this place but fear not they have menus in both Spanish and English. By far we LOOOOVE the giant fully stuffed, Saturday ONLY BBQ Lamb Tortas. Oh my what great flavor! Just seven bucks each. We stock up on 4 or 5 of them and deep freeze them at home. This is what earns them Five Stars!

The flavors here are a bit on the spicey side with an awesome creemy green chili hot sauce and a sharp red chili too! The combo plates are one of a kind and these guys make some great Civiche y Mariscos. The Shrimp Fajitas are to die for!!! Most dishes come with Mexican black beens and rice with the authentic cheese toppings. 

Best of all the prices are great with a Ninos menu too and a nice atmosphere with the music alive and an occasional Fotbol game on the TV!!!    VIVA EL TLACOYO!"}
{"text":"Me encanta comer aqui, tienen un buen sazon y servicio.
Los tacos y lastortillas deliciosas, los tlacoyos suoer buenos a todos  nos gustaron.
we love this food"}
{"text":"The food was heavy, americanized \"Mexican\" food.  Authentic mexican food is so fresh and this was far from fresh.  The prices were very high for such low quality.  Al pastor was soggy and unrecognizable and quesadillas were fried masa."}
{"text":"Excellent.
A must for Mexican food.
Not fancy decorations, who wants a fancy place when the food is the best ever.
Our waiter, Eeron, was outstanding. He was so helpful and patient. He explained everything and helped us make our decisions. He suggested his favorite, enchiladas. He was right they were awesome!
We got a small dish of cactus, nopales, it was tasty. Kinda like a soft pickles pepper.  A must try. Authentic Mexican food at its very best. 
Come for the fabulous food, leave full and content.
You must go behind a convenience store , that is on university. They are set back from the street.
Words cannot say enough, just go!"}
{"text":"I am afraid to write this review, for fear of it becoming super busy!

If you are coming here for the decor you will be disappointed. 

But if you are coming for some amazing food (and aren't a spice wuss), you will be blown away.  The service from the lone female server is always sweet and quick, despite a bit of a language barrier (...if you're a silly gringo who only speaks English, that is).

I shy away from meats, including the more interesting offerings here, but anything I've had that is vegetarian, or vegetarian after my slight adjustments to the menu, are delish.  

Annoyingly closed on Wednesdays.

Bonus: keep up to date on your telenovelas while you dine!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Most delicious and authentic food. You'll always get chips and salsa. Red and green, which are both spicy! I typically order the tacos with the option of onion and cilantro. Tasty! The server is the same person every time. Friendly and fast service. The owner is on-site a lot and greets customers. The environment is colorful, brightly lite from the large windows. TV, music, bar. It's nice to walk into an inviting place. Home food, away from home."}
{"text":"Was here on a Sunday evening with a large group-about 20 Wild Dining gringos-and boy, how we feasted! The decor was pleasant, the service attentive (we kept the two servers running, but they never missed a beat), and the food ... simply wonderful. For a pig-out $20, I had a Negra Modelo, horchata, two cheese crisps (huitlacoche and pumpkin blossom), two tacos (lamb and tongue), and flan, plus some of the best chips and salsa ever. I had three extra meals from the leftovers, too. 

- The cook said the greenish salsa is just jalapeños and oil. Oh, my, I MUST learn to make that. The other salsa seemed to be chipotle. Neither is for wimps. Don't ask for mild salsa here, there isn't any. But the slow burn of both hotties is fantastic with the mildly salted chips. 
- The cheese crisps were not what I was expecting. They're empañada-like, fried but not heavy. I liked both.
- It's worth going when they have lamb. Mmmm. But my favorite was the tongue taco. The little cubes of meat were as tender as anything I've ever eaten. And there was plenty of cilantro, onions, and the salsas to dress them up. 
- The flan was rich and dense, I definitely recommend finishing your feast with it. 
- I just can't say enough good things about the service. Twenty diners is a lot to keep up with, and they were unflappable. 

We're already talking about how soon we can return to El Tlacoyo. We agreed that you could dine here repeatedly and naver duplicate a meal-and I expect most of us will be testing that theory."}
{"text":"I read previous reviews & thought this would be a great little hole in the wall. Ugh. Ordered a hamburger for grandson & he's 4 & will eat anything but not this burger. Hope we don't get food poisoning. The salsa was not only waay too hot but the flavor sucked. The chips were disgusting & beans nasty. Never never again. Barf"}
{"text":"Authentic indeed. I brag to all my colleagues that I live so close to this place and how the food is so great."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal, bringing authentic regional cooking. I trusted Silviana's recommendation and am so glad I did."}
{"text":"Wow.  This is the kind of restaurant that I've been looking for all these years in AZ.  I always hesitate to call Mexican restaurants in the US \"authentic\" (since that term has been debased by all the yokels who think Chipotle is \"authentic Mexican\"), but I'll go ahead and put that label on this restaurant!  You want a real Huarache?  They have it.  Real Tlacoyo?  As their name says, they have it.  BBQ braised lamb?  Come on a Sunday.  Excellent tacos?  Of course.

And here's the best part: you won't need to walk out the door with a $50 bill.

Thank you Senior \"El Tlacoyo!\" And when Guy Fieri comes calling, please send him away!!!"}
{"text":"Finally I found a authentic Mexican food. Born in mexico city, has been hard for me to find a Mexican restaurant that would take me back to my roots. Everything is delicious and the prices are unbearable. Ill definitely? coming back."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but just authentic Mexican food. I live up in Cave Creek, and will venture down to Mesa again to come here. Yum!"}
{"text":"El Tiacoyo is not your usual Mexican Restaurant. It's Hidalgo Regional Cuisine. That means you can order things like cow foot tacos, cactus soup, head meat tacos, sausage and intestine tacos, huitiacoche cheese crisp, barbacoa, mixotes and so much more!

They have weekend specials this past weekend it was lamb tacos but on past visits I saw goat and brain tacos.

They start you off with chips and a creamy green very spicy sauce thats very good and a smokey red sauce that's also good and less spicy. 

We got the huitiacoche  (also known as corn smut or Mexican Truffle) cheese crisp. It's not the Americanized watered down version it's the real stuff. Very earthy and interesting. 

From what I tried so far from here I've found that they do very good fish dishes here very reasonably priced. They don't use that cheap tilapia or muddy tasting swai fish like other places use. From the two fish dishes I tasted it seems like a very fresh sweet snapper kind of fish. This time I tried what they called grilled fish. When I saw it I thought they gave me the wrong thing because I received an aluminum envelope filled with very moist very fresh tasting fish cooked in juices from tomato and onions and a little butter. By looking at the envelope I think they cooked it on the grill. This dish came with average rice and beans and tortillas. 

My husband tried the chicken enchiladas, They were made with very fresh tasting chicken and were or mostly were just filled with chicken. The green chili sauce that topped them was very heavy with lime juice.

I should mention that this place is not fancy and is very raw looking so you only come here for the food and not the ambiance. It's also hard to see from the street because it's located behind another building.

4.5 stars I didn't round up to 5 because of the average rice and beans and lack of atmosphere"}
{"text":"Before you go to this restaurant be sure that you can handle very spicy food. We had asked our waitress how spicy the food was that we were ordering and she told us that it was mild. When we got our food we could not even eat it it burned our mouths and throats so badly. The waitress was very good at playing dumb. We will never go back here"}
{"text":"Muy Auténtico!

Big menu, with TONS of stuff in many categories - tacos, combination plates, quesadillas, tortas, etc.

I had a \"corn smut\" quesadilla, and the barbacoa taco.  It was the first time I had ever tried corn smut, and I did enjoy it.  Very tasty.

The barbacoa was good, but did not have a lot of seasoning....it was on the line between \"too dry and barely not too dry.\"  Would not order it again, and that's the only reason this little place is not a 5-star from me.

They brought a tub of cilantro, one of onions, and one of limes with my food for doctoring - nice touch you don't get from most places....

They have a little jalapeno cream salsa served with the chips and a red salsa.  When I asked the server what was in the cream sauce, she said they would not tell her - \"Grandma's secret recipe.\"  It was DELICIOUS.  I had two tubs of it and wanted to strap a pump directly into my mouth and have it 24x7.  Great stuff.

I was the only white boy in the place, and it was packed.  Locals must love it.  I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of Mexican dishes at fair prices. Their tripa tacos are my absolute favorite! I ordered some to go, they are that good!"}
{"text":"Well, the bad news is that after eating here now I may need to relocate to Tempe, AZ.
The place is small and low budget, but I found some food favorites that I have not seen anywhere else. Tacos de buche (pork stomach?), tripitas (tripe?), lengua (tongue) aaaaaand.... sesos (brains)... plus the quesadilla de huitlacoche... well, I was not so crazy about that one, but the tacos were awesome! I even ventured to try a flan and it was very good."}
{"text":"Real authentic Mexican food. great beff tongue tacos and chicken tacos. I'd stay away from the taco tripa not for me. Definitely will be back to this spot"}
{"text":"This is a really great spot in Tempe. Authentic menu with lots to choose from. 

We seated ourselves and servers were quick to provide chips and salsa. Coke is served from the bottle which is a nice touch. 

The food was great. Ordered beef head, beef tongue and sausage and cactus soft tacos, along with a bean and cheese burrito with red enchilada sauce. The beef tongue taco was incredible and instantly became one of my favorite tacos. 

I highly recommend this place for authentic Mexican food in town. 

P.S. Get the beef tongue tacos!"}
{"text":"My mom asked me where I wanted to go for dinner this evening. And El Tlacoyo popped in my head. I haven't been here since I was like 12 years old and everything I had today reminded me why this place has stuck in my mind.  

This place is in a little strip mall and there is a nicest girl attending all the tables. She paid great attention to every guest. 

So now to the food, this place is authentic food of the state of Hidalgo, Mexico so it's pretty spicy. Since my mom is vegetarian We had huaraches with cactus (nopalitos) which was perfect, just like my Nana cooked them. The nopalitos were tangy and cooked perfectly. We also got a quesadilla with huitlachoche and a quesadilla with pumpkin flower, I would highly recommend the pumpkin flower. The taste was subtle and a nice contrast to the salsa. In addition to that I had the BBQ lamb taco, this did make me disappointed because the lamb was very dry and under seasoned. 

All in all if you aren't afraid of spice and want epic Mexican food this is the place. Beware they are closed on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant by us when I am craving tacos. The ingredients are super fresh, the food is always delicious, service is great, and prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Family run mexican restaurant. The place is small,  clean,  and safe. They only have bottled mexican soda or jug juice, no fountain soda. Menu has a lot of variety. We started with tortilla soup: tomato broth, tortilla chips, cheese....good but spicy. I had beef rolled tacos= delicious. Fiancé had steak burrito= also delicious. Many plates come with rice and beans.  Beans made with lard, so you can opt for double rice. ..the rice is super yummy (the white kind). Ended with flan that was authentic and also delicious. Free chips and salsa.  Apple soda was a plus. All this, 27$ with great service."}
{"text":"This is one of those tiny little restaurants tucked away behind a convenience store in a residential neighborhood. Easy to be overlooked for the entire year we lived a block away. That is very unfortunate because this place has the best tacos! $1.75 per taco. This place was very authentic. It had some adventurous items on the menu such as beef tongue, BBQ lamb, and brains... but we just stuck with the tacos for now. The salsa was very delicious as well. 

They have unusual hours. Only open for lunch during some weekdays. The weekends have more normal dining hours, so I would recommend making this a stop on Saturday or Sunday."}
{"text":"Forget the atmosphere, the service and food are worth it! The tlacoyos are unbelievable! I crave them everyday :) Warning: They are spicy!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I picked up food from here!  I miss there Cabeza Tortas!!!   They are tender and full of flavor especially with their sauces!!  We used to pick up food from here all the time when I worked in Tempe!!!   I miss it!!!"}
{"text":"Totally agree with the reviews! It's way cute inside, has comfy booths, and the menu prices are fantastic for burritos! Note that the menu on Yelp is outdated, and everything is a bit more. My Chile verde burrito was $7... not breaking the bank at all!! Chips aren't too hard, salsas and spicy and awesome, and the guac was chunky and not full of a bunch of mystery ingredients and fillers. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the most authentic tasting places I've been to in the Phoenix valley. 

To anyone who has never been to Hidalgo, this is as close as you can get to having their kind of food without having to book a flight out. During my first visit, we ordered the tortilla soup, ceviche tostadas, and the Tlacoyo (which is what their restaurant is named after) 

Everything tastes AMAZING! If you get the tortilla soup, I recommend asking for the tortilla strips on the side so it can cool off a bit before you mix them in. (Nobody has time for soggy tortilla strips haha) and also WATCH OUT FOR THE CHIPOTLE CHILE on the soup - incredibly hot if you eat it. The ceviche was fresh and had a very clean taste to it. The Tlacoyo was probably my favorite. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The tacos were awesome. Very authentic Mexican food....they also have a children menu which is very beneficial to me cuz I act like a 3 year old from time to time."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick lunch, and a quality check on this 4.5 star taco shop. Sunday afternoon, and AC must have died. Only there for a short time, no biggie. Chips came with a green, and a red hot sauce. Both delicious! Had a broiled beef taco, so-so, but the longanzia (spicy chorizo)  and nopales (cactus) was KILLER. One hit, one miss. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Oh my. Love this stuff! Having tripas tacos and enjoying the heck outta them! Good prices and reminds me of home. El paso tx."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice. What I love is how authentic the food is. Simple great lunch prices Mexican food done right if you want typical authentic this is a great option. Also I want to add I left my computer and they held on to it for me the waitress said she ran outside after me but we pulled away too quick.  I know they charge extra for extra chips and no refills with the lunch special but they have low prices that's the only way they can make enough to stay in business. I also particularly like that three people came over to check on us it shows that they care and have passion for what they do. If your like me and love Mexican food you are in for a treat."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Arizona. The salsa has a depth of flavor to it and after one bite, you can't stop putting it on everything! The prices are incredible low for how large the portions are. The staff always takes the extra time to get my young daughter her own water, even though I never ask. 
If you are into Americanized Mexican food or as traditional as it gets- this place is for you. I hope El Tlacoyo is around forever!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food!  Saturday & Sundays specials include Menudo and Lamb,  both were very flavorful and not fatty. $10 for a bucket of 6 Coronitas.



Sorry, no pictures because we ate it too fast!"}
{"text":"Ya dude, this place is awesome! This is Mexico City to the max, with dishes you've likely never seen at a Mexican restaurant before. Went down there with my homeboy Manuelito, and all I know is it's a good thing he's a Spanish speaker. 

They have a huge menu and everything is cheap, cheap, cheap. I ordered the El Tlacoyo's ($7.95) with a corn tortilla quesadilla on the side ($2.50). This quesadilla is freaking huge! And the tlacoyo's, which I had never heard of let alone eaten before, were awesome. Manny got the pumpkin flower quesadilla, also a Mexico City tradition, and it was awesome! Also never something I had heard of. The most expensive thing we had were our Mexican Coke's! 

All around this, this hole in the wall is delicious and really opened me up to some authentic Mexican food I'd never had an opportunity to try before. Try this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Outstanding Oaxacan cuisine at take out prices. Do not even think of comparing their authentic Mexican food with any chain place. Try it - - you'll like it!"}
{"text":"I love Lamb & when I discovered they cook it on Sat & Sun it became a must try. Their green salsa which comes w chips has some delicious fire to it. Friend ordered Shrimp soup which was tasty especially w the limes..Lamb sandwich I ordered was decorated beautifully w avocados, cheese, & sauces....Un4nately, the meat was dry & lacked seasoning. Disappointed because I was expecting more flavor like gyro meat.
Luckily there was more green salsa 2 help me finish it off. Lamb was OK , will need 2 explore menu in the future."}
{"text":"Good food from Hidalgo, Mexico.  The horchata was watery compared to what I'm used to elsewhere.  And getting the check was slow.  Overall I'll be back because the food was great."}
{"text":"Any time you come, you will have the best food, but come on sunday and have the lamb....
If you want boring amerexican food, go to...I don't know...taco bell.  If you want hot salsa, beef tongue tacos, and cactus flowers.... come here!  It's too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Don't let its looks or location fool you: it's clean and spacious. They have amazing delicacies from Michoacán and central Mexico, like huitlacoche, nopales, and flor de calabaza.  They also have aguas frescas and Mexican Coke. The salsas are tasty and spicy. The service is friendly, the music is loud, and the atmosphere is vibrant. We recommend the huaraches, sopes, and anything with tinga."}
{"text":"Closed on Wednesdays, otherwise limited hours. Have not found  hours for them posted online and when they do not answer the phone, there is no way of knowing.  Had to drive there yesterday just to find out."}
{"text":"Recommend the beef head and tongue. The lamb taco is really two so well worth it. Very authentic and if you are looking for real authentic Mexican tacos then this is the place!"}
{"text":"Went back again to this place.  Real authentic Mexican food  from Vera Cruz through Mexico city.  The best Chili Rellanos ever.  Hubby had that and I had the Chicken Enchiladas which we good but I guess I am a little older than the first time I came here so it seemed a little too spicy this time around.   The service was still wonderful and really a fun place to go if you are in the area.  Not at all like a chain restaurant. A nice little cozy restaurant with a family feel."}
{"text":"Certainly a diamond in the ruff. Everything i've had on their menu has been authentically super duper good! Not your typical greasy mess, I actually don't feel bad after eating here. The free chips and salsa they serve are bomb; chile relleno, camarones el diablo, and tortas are some of the best I've had in the valley. Try it out!!!!"}
{"text":"Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was no air conditioning. Its 106 outside and NO AC???? Sat down and the waitress brought over chips, salsa, and some yellow/greenish kind of dip. The chips were stale. The salsa was OK. The greenish/yellowish stuff was crappish. I got an Iced tea. Although there was some ice in it, it wasn't cold. Then I ordered a burrito, which came with rice and beans. The burrito was ok, as were the rice and beans. My iced tea was never refilled. Not sure I would have wanted any more though. The iced tea just wasn't very good.

The whole time, there was a soccer game on all the TV's in the place. The same game was on all the TV's but the audio was several seconds off on each TV. Very annoying.

Summary: just OK. I shan't go back."}
{"text":"I highly recommend El Tlacoyo! I am not qualified to say this place has \"authentic\" food, because I'm not Mexican and it's not for me to say. But I've had a lot of Mexican food and this place was probably the best I've ever had. We had to try their signature dish, the Tlacoyos. So unique - and REALLY GOOD! We also ordered the Azteca torta (absolutely delicious), tortilla soup (interesting, really flavorful without being over-seasoned like it was trying too hard), a couple of soft tacos, and a lingua (tongue) burrito. I managed to get a bite of almost everything and it was all top notch.

I don't get the comments about lack of atmosphere. The place was simple, but full of rich color. It did not distract from the food and that was fine.

To the gal who could not eat anything because her mouth and throat were burned and blamed the waitress for it, understand this: To ask \"how hot is it?\" is a stupid question (yes, there are stupid questions). Perception of \"hot\" is completely relative. I will just say I don't like intensely hot (spicy) foods, yet I found nothing here that caused discomfort at all. You might want to watch out for the very pale colored dip that comes with the opening chips - it looks creamy, but it will kick your butt...but still managed to be flavorful. It's relative. If you don't like spicy foods don't go to a freaking Mexican restaurant and then give them a rotten review, OK?"}
{"text":"I came here several times with a large MeetUp ethnic dining group, 20 people.   I love lamb, but I do feel the same that the other Yelpers commented, that the lamb, tho tender, is dry and rather bland and boring.  The first time I had it, I tried to put it in the lamb broth, to make it less dry and try to give the lamb more flavoring, but the broth was also rather boring.  Then 2 years went by , and I came back with the same MeetUp on a weekend June 25, 2017.   Being that  they only have the roast lamb on the weekends, I didn't remember enough of my previous lamb experience, and ordered lamb burrito on June 25.  The lamb inside the burrito was plentiful (8 oz) and the burrito cost $9.99, but there was nothing but the boring lamb and cilantro inside the burrito.  No sauces, onions, or cheeses.  And the folds of flour tortilla made for a big wad of dough inside the burrito.  I give the burrito 1.5 stars.  I added as much green salsa and onions from our condiment caddy, as I could push into the burrito to jazz it up a bit.

The service for our group of 20, even tho we forewarned them and made reservations, was really slow and they didn't even bring arrivals water.  It was SO HOT IN THE RESTAURANT, THE AC COULD NOT KEEP UP.  Every seat almost, was occupied in the restaurant.  Two people in our party left as soon as they got there because they could not stand the heat, and they/I/we could not get anyone to get around to bringing them/us water.  I give the service 2 stars for our group service both times.  It would be 1 star if the service was rude, but they were not rude, just busy.

I had the flan for dessert.   5 stars for the taste and the price, only $ 2.50.  

Then because I saw their sign about their 18th year Anniversary on June 30, where you can buy 3 beers for .18 each, I went back again on June 30, at 2 pm, to eat my favorite Mexican entree, chilli relleno with rice and beans.  The taste of the relleno (2) was unremarkable, and portion not a lot, when the lamb burrito had much more, plus rice and beans, and both were $9.99.  The chili relleno during the lunch special at Si Senor is much larger, even tho it is just one, vs Tlacayo's 2 small ones.  PLUS for $6.99 Si Senor lunch special, you get lotsa chips with 4 different dips, rice and beans (more generous portion than El Tlacayo's) AND a fried sopapilla with honey for dessert, all for $3 less.  Eating there makes me soooooo happy !   

For the 18th Anniversary beer at El Tlacayo I had Tecate light, because the other Mexican beers had more alcohol and were possibly bitter.  I love beer, but it's gotta be light and mild, like PBR.  And I can only drink one.  We Asians lack an enzyme in our livers that processes alcohol, did ya know?  Asians who lack this enzyme include native Am Indians, but too many of them drink anyways.

My chili relleno server's name was Mary (aka nick name Pirus).  She was excellent, 5 stars.  She came to check on me twice.  But this time, I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE RESTAURANT!  So I was attended to, 5 stars for Mary lifts 1-2 stars for previous slow service, no water in insufficient AC (fine with no one in the restaurant but me), bad enough for people to leave and not eat there, and for the dry and boring lamb.  Average rating for all these experiences is 3 stars.

I like lengua, tripe, tongue, beef head, brains, menudo, and beef feet, so someday I will go back and try those.

 I like it that other than the MeetUp Whitey Gringos including myself, all the rest of the customers here are all Mexican and their families, sign of true authenticity."}
{"text":"Dont know what the rave is at this place, ordered the lengua burrito that came with beans and rice. Beans and rice tasted bland like From a can. Chips and salsa tasted like they came from a bag and bottle from The store. The burrito itself was okay nothing great. Service was horrible, the server was not friendly or attentive. Only saw him once and it took a while to get the check. We actually had to get up and poke our head in the kitchen."}
