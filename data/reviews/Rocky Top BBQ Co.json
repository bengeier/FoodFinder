{"text":"I've been to the food truck a couple of times.  The pulled pork is very flavorful; no sauce required.  I usually get some variation of the mac and cheese as a side.  Creamy and delicious.  Service is friendly and prompt.  An easy go-to for lunch."}
{"text":"I have started grabbing lunch from the food truck when they are parked nearby and it is so good! I love the Porkfait and the service is so friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I got the pork bbq platter which included the pork, two sides a generic hamburger roll and their house made bbq sauce. The pork and bbq sauce were good but the sides were horrible. I got the beans and coleslaw and could only take one bite of each before spitting both bites out. I went back and exchanged the beans and slaw for green beans and Mac and cheese and the green beans were just as bad. Cold watery and bland. Mac and cheese was okay. And for $13 I was extremely disappointed. Food trucks usually have amazing food. This one I wouldn't recommend unless they make better sides. I could have gone to Sonny's and gotten all you can eat bbq for $8.99 with way better sides."}
{"text":"How are you going to call yourself Rocky Top then serve me vinegar BBQ?!??! If it wasn't for the good Mac and cheese they would have 0 stars"}
{"text":"As a Tennessee boy, I wasn't sure TN BBQ could compete here in Charlotte, but dang if I wasn't wrong!!! This is some of the best bbq I've had in Charlotte since we've moved here-- and it came from TN?!? The service is excellent, too  and for the price, you can't beat that portion size!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this food truck!! Best Bbq and sides I've ever had!! They have a variety of choices including sandwiches, plates, tacos, nachos, and appetizers. The bacon jalape√±o Mac and cheese is to die for!!!! Service is always amazing too!!"}
