{"text":"Food and value are good. On a cold busy day make sure you get a table towards the back because the doors are automatic and people stand by them while waiting to be seated and the cold runs right into the dinning area. Had to eat with my coat on it was so cold."}
{"text":"What a beautiful looking restaurant for the amazing food. This is the 1st time I ate buffet where we ordered on an ipad and they brought all the food to your table. It was so fast. The quality of the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Decor is fantastic. This is why I gave 1 star. Otherwise, it would be 0. The waiter had a heavy accent. An attempt to figure out ingredients of the food was unsuccessful. As a result we ordered seafood soup, general tao chicken and shrimp pad tai. Seafood soup was basically bowl of pasta with something, but not seafoodish. The waiter was betting it's the seafood soup we have ordered. Let me tell you if they said pasta soup with seafood elements, we would never eat it. There is no mandatory calory information. And the have what to hide. The general Tao would probably resurrect and start a new war if he knew what kind of \"chicken\" they serve in his name. Mix of sugar, baking stuff, deep fried with something that resembles chicken structure. It's not a chicken! Pad tai had very weird taste and we could not build shrimp defense wall against general Tao attack. Was it 7 or 8 shrimps? The waiter was excited that we cover this trash, but obviously got no tips. I hope this will bring attention of the management or at least defer visit of some guests."}
{"text":"Amazing food and huge selection. Modern decor and a great atmosphere. Kind staff, fast servive. No debit though, must make withdrawls from ATM at front. Going in a large group would be advisable."}
{"text":"First time trying here since my Mom and brother raved about this being one of the top ayce places...We finally came after some golfing. First impression of this place, its quite nicely decorated like 'dragon pearl' buffet. The seating of the cushion is nice, except the chair we were sitting on. You order your food on the IPAD like Kiku sushi, then they bring your food.  We got quite a bit of things obviously, so I'll mentioned the goods and not so good.  Good: crab legs(sweet tasting like Mandarin buffet), scallop sashimi (nice treat), beef tataki (kind of like carpacchio), grilled zucchini (lol, I know), nice selections of shrimps.  Bad: when you order a bunch of food, they start piling all the food even if you have no room. The service is not there, unless u call them. We had to ask for stuff b/c crab legs you need napkins, you need cracker, you need plate to put the shell...=( but it tastes good! - The service here is very forward and unpleasant in responding to customers concern or questions, they definitely make you feel a bit silly...  When we were finishing up our deserts, we had a bit of leftover on sashimi and maki rolls, and the server said if we don't finish, there will be extra charge! Uh, that never happens to us but just show the type of service we were dealing with. I get it, don't waste food, but there wasn't too much to cause such a fuss, but their 'Assistant Manager' aka our server had to make it known to us...  Overall I would come back to enjoy the buffet here and there, but their service is definitely questionable in some regards. For $30+ pp, the food is nice, but the service would remind you there may be other options as well. For Newmarket its a score though!"}
{"text":"Pricey but the food is quite good. Good service, interesting ordering method (using an IPAD), an overall 4 star experience. I would recommend it to friends and family!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The iPad ordering was cool the price is good considering it's all you can eat. The service was really good the staff are really helpful too. Eat the mango pudding and ice cream. They're to die for."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times, the prices are high, but with the all you can eat you do get a lot of food. It's usually been pretty good service here although the last time we where eating in the restaurant we ordered some take out food to pick up after, in the brochure it advertises a discount and they refused to give us our discount because we had ordered the take-out food within the restaurant rather than outside, it was a little ridiculous, and unfortunately kind of ruined the restaurant for us as we will not be going back for this reason."}
{"text":"This place easily falls under the category of \"mass produced food=poor quality\", along with all other buffet-style restaurants I have every tried. The quality of food was poor, flavour was poor, the over all experience was poor.   Food tasted frozen (pretty sure the spring rolls served were the same frozen boxed ones you can get from PC), food was mostly cold when brought to our table and the flavours were lackluster.  I went yesterday for lunch and I can appreciate the chaos when a place is busy but that never warrants poor attitude from staff, cold food and overall sub par service. Each time a dish was dropped at the table, it was LITERALLY dropped on the table. It was brought out usually by one of 2 servers (one man, older, bald head, glasses and a younger girl, dark long hair) and they never even so much as made eye contact with us as they flew by and threw our dishes on the edge of the table. Again, I can appreciate when a place is busy and staff are running around but that should in NO WAY become an inconvenience to the patrons of your restaurant. You suck it up, toughen up and throw a smile on your face otherwise you get stuck with the weak tip you deserve. We are not pigs being ushered into the slop troughs so don't throw food at people as if they are nothing more than that. It's rude, inappropriate and classless.   Our table seats were wet when we went to sit down, the service was slow, the food was not enjoyable, the overall experience was poor. I was very disappointed because I had been here when it first opened and thought it was great. You are a restaurant, you do one thing- SERVE FOOD! You have one requirement and that is to make someone's dining experience enjoyable from start to finish. If you are unable to even hire staff that are pleasant to be around then you really have no purpose being in the food industry.   If you want crap quality food and don't care about what you eat and how it is prepared, you just want to pay and stuff your face until your little heart's content then I suggest skipping this place and going to the Mandarin which is in the same plaza. At least then you are aware of the diarrhea that will most likely ensue after your shitty meal. I wouldn't pay for this place ever again."}
{"text":"Went there for Saturday dinner, I thought the word of \"all you can eat buffet\" is to see the foods laid out in long table like Mandarin restaurant. Was I wrong. It's laid out in IPAD, browse the menu and order thru ipad. New way for us.  The foods are good, loves the sushi. The price, a little bit expensive. We ordered fried rice and some dishes to eat with it but rice arrived first then a few minutes later came the dishes one by one. They should serve it at the same time. The staffs are helpful and friendly though."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time and found the food was delicious and intricate. It's all-you-can-eat. Compare with other similar restaurant, the food choices are pretty wide-ranged, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean food.the price is reasonable. The atmosphere is good. We will be there again."}
{"text":"The best AYCE Asian around! They have great selection and the service is super quick. Dirty dishes are cleared from the table immediately. The price is somewhat reasonable considering the amount and quality of food.  If you want great food... Go here. If you want great service... Go here. If you want great selection... Go here.  Oh... Almost forgot... Get the cream puffs for dessert... They are served warm and almost melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Went here because I heard good things about it but was disappointed. It's pretty average."}
{"text":"There is no contact on the website to write a complaint so my only other option is here. My girlfriend and I went to Cynthias on Tuesday Dec 12th at about 11:30am.  We sat down and were informed that there lunch all you can eat menu is now $20.99 while the dinner menu is now $32.99.  We decided to give it a shot, even though we thought this was far more expensive to other places.  I ordered a variety of their new shrimp plates and some basic sushi.  The rice that came with our sushi was hard and cold and after a few minutes I felt stomach pains.  I went to the washroom and come back only feeling moderately better.  I wanted to order some other food because I was hungry and (at the inflated holiday price), I figured I should probably eat something.  We ordered their battered mushroom.  It was not very good at all and had a rubbery texture that was less than pleasant.  I might have ordered less than 6 pieces of sushi and I was more than ready to leave.  I did not want to stay and make a fuss because my stomach did not like the meal one bit.  The rose salmon was the worst of the meal, mostly from the low quality rice.  Again it was quite hard and cold did not taste very good.  At in inflated price, I would expect better quality sushi and good quality/well prepared rice and other good food.  There was not even a lot of people in the restaurant, so I'm not sure why the quality was so low. Because I could not write this in a private complaint to the restaurant, I hope to hear back from the restaurant.  For $60 after tax and tip for the 2 of us, I hoped to be full and happy, instead I felt like I paid too much to be sick, not full and have low quality food. Oh for dim sum lovers.  Just because this is offered, it doesn't mean its good.  Normal dim sum places specialize in doing good dim sum.  Non dim sum places make you wonder if you even like dim sum.  I love shrimp dumplings, but on this day, I only made 1 order and forced myself to finish it. Pork dumplings were nothing special. The service was good, the decor is good, but I come because I'm hungry for good food."}
{"text":"It was a curiosity visit, first time, Saturday evening,  before we made a reservation call. So got our table in 3 min as arrived, very friendly smiling servers, easy and convenient method of order (try the tablets), BUT take care and DO NOT PLACE ALL ORDER TOGETHER AT BEGINNING, it will turn in nonstop \"river of food\", make your choice and order step by step, food is coming very quickly even in weekend's evening! Food is tasty and freshly prepared! Good choice of menu. One thing that will make me think to go back -  its how it was loud and noise, we could hardly hear each other... Probably we should try another time :)"}
{"text":"Nice to be able to order food on an iPad. You see picture for every dish before ordering. Service is very fast. Friendly waitresses. We got free lamb steak for Birthday."}
{"text":"For all you can eat, this place is goddamn amazing. Crab legs. I just swam in crab legs. Apparently the lamb was amazing, the sushi was fresh and it fulfilled all my AYCE dreams. Nothing tasted day old!  The most amazing thing was that the washroom door was AUTOMATIC. Hands free! My oily hands didn't touch anything! And I didn't have to touch the door handle to get out! I don't think the toilet doors are hands free but man. Way to go, Cynthia!  Only thing I can complain about is that the seared tuna and salmon could be seared a little bit more.   The seating is comfortable and the drinks keep coming! Whaaaaaaat."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was okay. Very small portions but I guess so cus it's all you can eat. Decor is very nice, seems clean. Only problem I had was it was extremely expensive for dinner, 70 For two people. I had payed by debit and was going to leave a cash tip, the manager had come to take the receipt from the machine and said \" what? You aren't going to tip?\" I thought it was extremely rude coming from a manager. You should NEVER ask for a tip from customers or say anything rude if they don't tip. I was very offended by this and left five dollars (out of anger) the manager brought me back the five dollars in Coins and said that the tip wasn't valuable to the staff, I just left the money on the table and left, nobody said goodbye or thankyou"}
{"text":"On a scale of 1-10 I give this restaurant a 1. The service is very bad, they gave us the wrong dish (chicken with vegetables swimming in boiled watered down gravy, instead of Kung pao chicken with cashews) and the waiter tried to convince us that it was the right dish.  I had a stomach ache when I left the place. The manager ignored our complaint. Very very bad service. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was probably the best thing about this restaurant. The food was good, but I didn't think it was worth the price. The service was fairly quick but the grilled options were often a little burnt. Great sashimi though!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  It;s not as good as the spoon and fork but not bad.  What irritated us this time is that we always use a 15 percent coupon when we go.  This time the coupon said that it had to be cash only.  They refused to accept it.  Not right!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great place.  The exquisite decoration makes you feel in a top notch place. But the sushi is definitely one of the best (or the best) in the greater Toronto area. Attention to details from the washroom floor to the use of iPad to have your orders are definitely translated in a greater experience. We will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, kept going back because the food was really good and they had good variety. The decor is really nice as well.  However, after our last visit we will not be going back. Normally I don't mind a bit of crappy service so long as the food is good, but this time will be our last.  Constantly stuff from our orders is missing, so we have to re order.  Although the place closes at 10:00, the kitchen closes at 9 and you won't be able to order anymore food after that. Nowhere is this mentioned on their website or when we come in.  Now, the really annoying part- it is 9:20 and they bring our bill before we even ordered dessert! Fine. We ignore it and continue eating. The waiver comes back and asks us how we want to pay. With my mouth full of dessert I manage to ask if we can finish eating first. HE SAYS NO, WE MUST PAY NOW AS THEY CLOSE UP THE TILLS!!! THIS IS AT 9:20!!! RESTAURANt DOES NOT CLOSE UNTIL 10!! HE WOULD NOT LET US CONTINUE EATING AND WOULD NOT LEAVE THE TABLE UNTIL WE PAID!!!  NEVER HAVE I WITNESSED SUCH HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. IT IS CLEAR THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS, JUST THEIR MONEY. DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas Day since it was 1 of 2 restaurants open near us.  The good reviews I've heard from friends definitely were true. The atmosphere is nice, the restaurant is beautifully decorated (even the washrooms are gorgeous!)  We were seated at our table and handed an ipad to place our AYCE orders, search for items on the menu with photos and descriptions of each items. The iPad stayed at our table and was really easy to use for the duration of the meal.   There were many vegetarian options to choose from (the iPad menu made it really easy to identify which items had no meat)!   Fave was definitely the Avocade Pizza and Spicy Tempura Rolls....yumm!  I even got a 10% off coupon for today's meal when I checked in on Yelp! Thanks Cynthia's, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I recommend going with a large group, have some fun tasting the food, sharing.. I've seen this posted before. Its fine of course for a smaller group or a date, but with the ease of the iPad its simple to order for large groups without confusion. Food always comes quickly. Desserts are tiny, but I love the mango pudding.The atmosphere is pretty interesting! Nice bathrooms too. Servers are pleasant.   To be honest, I always feel a little rushed at the end, or like we cannot order more than twice.. I understand all you can eat has its exceptions, but I've never been in a group thats gone overboard.  Little pricey for dinner..  I will likely go back!"}
{"text":"This AYCE restaurant is out of the way for me; however, I know a minority partner in the restaurant and he has wanted me to try it. I liked the food a lot. Some of the items are new to me, some remind me of his other restaurant and some items are on the menu of his wife's restaurant. As an earlier reviewer commented, too much salt was used in one item. Business was good, but not great when I was there for lunch today.  The interior design is nice, although the drinks bar was big and underutilized while the sushi bar was hidden away.   The servers were friendly. I took it as a compliment to be asked for my ID when I asked for the seniors price."}
{"text":"Ipad-based buffets are becoming a thing and they have some serious advantages over the classic hot-table service - primarily that you're not waiting in line, the food never runs out and you don't have to worry about errant sneezes.  That said, the quality of the food isn't significantly improved over its competitor - not that it's bad food, it's actually quite good - but not as good as a regular, dish-based Chinese restaurant.  The atmosphere is quite nice, lively without being loud and the subdued decorations disguise how close the quarters are between diners.  Overall it's a pleasant place to come for conversation between two or a larger group.  It's fairly kid friendly, though like any buffet you're putting some reliance on finding something the kids like -they do have french fries and crispy chicken for pickier eaters."}
{"text":"For what you pay, for what you get, there is nothing better.  They make acceptional rolls and their sashimi is on point. I eat here at least twice a week between shifts and with work employees. Great service and fast to bring food to the table!"}
{"text":"Very expensive looking decor and feel. Exclusive booths that gives a private and intimate feeling to a small group or date. Love the iPad and high resolution images for buffet choices in just a few clicks. Easy to order. Quality is pretty good. Lots of options. The last call for food is 9:30 so don't go at 9:00 as you feel rushed. Asian people like to get out ASAP and will not care if you are enjoying your food they want to get out so there's alot of noises and yelling during clean up."}
{"text":"Food tatse good, but poor customer service which leaves you unappreciated and bad taste. The guy in front is too rude when asking questions like where is my welcome?"}
{"text":"Good service Good food Nice atmosphere  Child friendly  Clean dining area  Calling ahead was a life saver for young parents with a child. We were seated in a quiet corner with a high chair and enough space for our stroller."}
{"text":"went there over the Christmas time, the sea food is so fresh,  did not notice the price, because friend paid for it.   may be somewhere around the 40 dollar range.  will go back if i want eat buffet."}
{"text":"I usually love Cynthia's but the staff kills it for me. I've gone there a few times for take out sushi and the waiter argues with me every time about how they don't have the sushi roll I want and every time I have to go get the menu to show them that they DO in fact have it. Very annoying. Also went there with a few friends and they brought me a hand roll instead of a normal sushi roll and I explained that I didn't order that and he kept trying to convince me that it's what I ordered and even put it back in front of me after lifting it off the table. Also as we were eating random servers came by and started clearing our table while we were eating and even took my chopsticks away while I still had sushi left and then wiped down the table while we were sitting there.. so so so weird... food is pretty good tho if you can get past the awkward service"}
{"text":"The cooked Chinese and Japanese food was very good, but I made the mistake of coming here looking for sushi. And the sushi was dry, oddly temperatured and very limited to choose from."}
{"text":"My family enjoyed the interactive ipad menu with pictures of the food.  The service was very good.  This is the place to go for a great time out.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and great for an all you can eat buffet,  where the food comes to you."}
{"text":"Oh my gawwd so happy we found this spot what an amazing experience dining in a cool eclectic restaurant while ordering off ipads and watching the magic unfold on the table top!! Everything was extra saucy and flavourful with great variety and quality!! The food was piping hot and fresh and so fast you can't eat quick enough it keeps on coming lol"}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Service was decent.  Beware of their advertised lunch special that is featured prominently at the front door.  You are given an iPad to order with at the table and it is only when you are done that you are informed that your bill is 2x as much because you did not specifically request the special menu that was never offered.  This really feels like a deliberate trick to me and it is a shameful way to drive up the bill."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5 ( the cooked food was pretty salty)  Service: 1.5/5 (not friendly, slow, and forgot our orders)   Lunch: Mon - Fri $16.99 ; Weekend & Holidays: $20.99. Dinner: Mon - Fri $25.99 ; Weekend & Holidays: $32.99.  We went here for AYCE Lunch on Monday, the place wasn't busy, but the service was very poor and slow. For example: it was nice to order all the food on their iPads, but submitting orders required a password, so we weren't able to submit the order without our waiters assistance. Weird!  We tried to order a little bit of everything, but half our orders were either missing or went to the next table.  We tried to ask waiter to check our orders, but he never came back to update our order status! Towards the end, we had started to order dessert, when suddenly some of the missing orders showed up to our table! Let's talk about food: sushi rolls were average, beef ribs were tender enough but a bit salty, tempura was good because the batter was thin and crispy. The stir fried beef with onion wrapped with a steamed bun was my favorite! Last but not least, the blueberry & coconut soft ice cream was the best dessert that they have.  Overall the food was decent with some stand outs, but the service really soured me on the experience! Definitely not worth returning."}
{"text":"I went for a lunch AYCE and for the price, the quality was pretty sub-par. The rice on the Nigiri was not as flavorful or chewy (as typical Japanese short grain rice is supposed to be) and i found it was on a bit drier side. The fish was good, but I would say not as fresh as I would like it to be compared to other a la carte offerings elsewhere.  The cooked food was actually pretty good. The beef BBQ ribs were flavorful (although a bit burnt on one side, but it was still for the most part juicy.) The tempura had a nice light batter and the dip was nice and flavorful.  I would say, their lunch offerings definitely leaves something to be desired, but considering the other All-You-Can-Eat Sushi places in Newmarket, this is probably the best one that I can recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here with family many many times and this time was even better than before. They've added a lot more options on their menu which was awesome. The food all taste exceptional, the sushi is absolutely amazing  the udon is also very good , and the portion is the perfect size not too big and not too small. The service was very good, everyone was so nice and very quick with serving food and taking empty dishes. And they refill your water very quickly too. As someone who drinks a lot of water when eating, i always tend to have an empty cup and need to ask the waitor multiple times for more water. But at Cynthia's, the waiters refilled my water before i ever finished any of my cups which was very much appreciated. Definitely will be back more!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested we go all the way north to try this all you can eat up north,  & I was quite satisfied with it.   Big restaurant, nice decor The Menu had a lot of good stuff to offer , better & more choices than other all you can eats.  Pretty fresh for the most part  Garlic beef & garlic herb shrimp are recommended.   & i dont like desserts generally but this place is the only place that has COCONUT ice cream cones   Won me over big lol  Pretty expensive  Came to $37 for friday night dinner But will be back"}
{"text":"The service is terrible.  The sushi is crap.   We have been collecting the loyalty card over multiple visits and today, on our 10th and should be free visit - they refused to honor their own loyalty program.   The manager came out - he refused.  And weve come with different friends and family a bunch of times.  And always have tipped well and given good reviews.    We wont be back.   Cheap jerks."}
{"text":"I went to Cynthia Paradise with a group of 8 friends. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food.  Everything we ordered was super fresh and the variety was vast. For some who didn't like raw fish, there were lots of options. Ordering by iPad with pictures made it easy and you knew exactly what you were getting.  The only minor negative would be the snow crab legs. They were served cold as if they just came out of the fridge, but they were still sweet and tasty.  Knowing that now, next time I would ask them to heat it up.  I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"It Was good but recently the food quality and  taste has gone down , everything taste same and when Cynthia and her husband is there , service is good otherwise !!!!! No I was there fan since 2000 first the fine dining then all you can eat . But unfortunately they couldn't keep up the high standard only went high in price  they are cutting down on variety too . Whatever we write in review will not bring it up because newmarket is populated now if 10 % of older population donot go there , there are 90 % new population will be there because they cannot coach the differences . Anyway"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and great variety for all you can eat.  The service was excellent,  when we arrived I advised them of my gluten allergy and they were willing to provide excellent substitutes and advice.  ALLEN the assistant manager is the man to talk too.  He provided me with a list of all the gluten free options and the modifications they can make.  They even have GF soy sauce.  I would eat here again for sure!!  It's nice to finally fine a sushi place that understands GF and is willing to provide alternatives and excellent customer service!!!"}
{"text":"They don't except debt  We go there and the servers don't speak English but really nice. You order on iPad and it's weird you're not allowed sending it the waitress has too. But annoying because they'll only send it if they see it on your table waiting.    The sushi and rolls were terrible. The salmon smelt horrible and so dry it was white. The seaweed here is very fishy tasting not like other ayce  The beef teriyaki seems to be boiled it's grey with sauce. Not good at alll  Beef short ribs amazing  There menu isn't huge it's pretty basic. Some added stuff of course   I wouldn't go back especially for the price.... two ppl lunch $40."}
{"text":"This is my very first time at one of these high tech all you can eat restaurants where you place order with an ipad. I like the idea of a picture menu, besides being able to visualize what I'm getting, looking at the food pictures made me really hungry =p  Take a look at Cynthia's Paradise grandiose interior! Comfortable seating and intricate decorations give this place a very fancy and luxurious feeling. Definitely one of the fanciest looking JAYCE restaurant I've been to.  Grilled Salmon Belly and Grilled Salmon Fillet. Fresh from the grill made with high quality Norwegian salmon (as recommended by our host Andy) the grilled salmon are some of the must- order items on the menu. If you're up for something juicy, fatty and crispy, the grilled salmon belly is the perfect choice for you. However, if you don't like bones or fish fat jelly, the salmon fillet would be an awesome choice.  And of course, the highlight of any JAYCE meal has to be the sushi and sashimi. We got a good variety of items in this boat including fresh sashimi ( salmon, tuna, octopus, surf clam etc). Some unique items included the smoked duck breast cucumber sushi and marinated sashimi on chips.  Green Dragon Roll Avocado, Tempura shrimp, cucumber topped with mango sauce. A refreshing combination of green dragon with mango sauce gave it a very interesting flavour where the sweetness of the sauce balanced out with the richness of avocado and deep fried shrimp.  Grilled beef short ribs is another classic and favourite dish. They were very tender with the perfect texture and slightly sweet with teriyaki sauce as marinate.    Since I'm a huge veggie lover, the grilled zucchini and grilled eggplant are definitely must gets. Seasoned with ground pepper and light teriyaki sauce, these tasted really good and we ordered the them more than once cause they were so delicious. Also good items to clear the palette with in between dishes.  And of course, white wine pairs amazingly with sushi.  We had the Riesling which was super refreshing and had the perfect level of sweetness.   To end off the wonderful night, we had some of my favorite desserts- mango/ greentea ice cream and mango yogurt! I loved the mango yogurt, it wasn't too sweet or too sour and is not something you can order everywhere.   Cynthia's Paradise is definitely one of the most grand and classy Japanese all you can eat restaurants I've been to. Unlike most other JAYCE restaurants out there, the quality, presentation and detail of food served at Cynthia's Paradise can match up to many authentic a la carte Japanese restaurants.  You can tell that chefs here put much more attention and care on the presentation of each dish despite it being a busy all you can eat location. Although it's located up in New Market far away from us, it is definitely worth a visit. If you plan to visit on the weekend, be sure to make a reservation as it does get busy. Oh Did I mention that if you go on your birthday, you can get an on stage performance from the superstar singer staffs here?"}
{"text":"Best part about this place is decor which is very modern and the tablets used to order the food are very convenient...and unfortunately this is where it ends. Prices are sky high but unfortunately the food quality is sub par. We did the all you can eat and the food was arriving at an astonishing rate...I then realized some of it was PRE MADE and tasted horrible. The quality of the fish was lacking to say the least. Tea was not included! how cheap are you Cynthia? Then came the desert ice cream...can you say FREEZER BURN? yuck. Will NEVER go back. Thanks for stealing my $80."}
{"text":"Went last night for supper and this seems like the place that my parents always bring out of town visitors, I guess because it is so fancy and the food there is incredible.  I would say this is one of the best all you can eat places in town. It is a bit more expensive but you are paying for service as well, and I find Cynthia's has a larger selection than all of the all you can eat places in Newmarket. The good thing about Cynthia's is that the portions do come in smaller sizes, so that way you don't ever make that common mistake at ordering too much at an all you can eat and end up wasting so much food.  The service was really good, half way through our dinner our server replaced all our dirty plates with new ones so that was a first ! Will definitely one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Newmarket, Cynthia and her staff never disappoints"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've ordered delivery many times. I've gotten orders with and without chopsticks, garlic/wasabi and soy. Its pretty annoying considering I always order rolls so its a given that those items should always be included. The mango hip hop roll is very good. So is the veggie and shrimp tempura."}
{"text":"When I lived in Newmarket this was my dinner place to go. The staff are super friendly and always accommodating. When you sit down they take your drink order and hand you an iPad for you to order off of. There is tons of food to choose from. There is Sushi soup grilled items and even dessert. I would suggest having it all because there is not one item on this list that is not good they are all delicious. Try and call ahead and book a reservation as they can fill up quickly for dinner. If you're looking for all-you-can-eat this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place was my first AYCE experience with a non buffet style system. Better yet they have tablets that you order off of each time and the food comes rather quickly , prepared hot and fresh. The servers here are always on top of getting your order through to the kitchen fast, and getting your drink needs covered through your meal. It's a great idea for staff dinners, easy to book ahead and usually discounts are offered when paying cash so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"A good AYCE Asian restaurant has to have a few things going for it. There must be a very good selection of items from which to choose.  The service must be quick, the surroundings comfortable, and of course the pricing is key.   Cynthia's Paradise has all of the elements down to an art. There is a pretty good sushi selection with a fair balance of protein to rice. Add a couple of dim sum treats, and finish off with a selection of mini deserts, and the range is great.   Order off of the iPad without worrying about getting another order sheet or a working pen. The food arrives hot and relatively quickly.   I liked pretty much everything I ordered. Items like the Chicken Wings were a bit drier and less tender than my reference joint, but not objectionable unless you're a total wing snob.   I finished off with only one desert-a smooth custard that was so light and subtle that I immediately ordered 2 more.   The only weird thing is the pricing model. It is a couple of dollars higher than the competition, but on the weekends (which apparently includes Friday) the lunch price is higher, and I don't know why."}
{"text":"Nice decor, it is for sure over the top. Food is okay, overpriced for what you can get in Aurora at the MI-NE sushi."}
{"text":"Very lame food. This is the kind of place that gives a bad name to sushi. As soon as you get in you have the feeling of entering a low-end Chinese restaurant. Then everything goes downhill from there. First clue was a soy sauce that looked terribly diluted. Then the sushi rolls, were so bad mainly due to the bad rice and bland flavours. We ate one bite of the sushi we had ordered and left the rest on the plate. This is ONE restaurant where you don't want to take a chance on raw fish. The cooked dishes were fine. The ice cream was good. The service was good. This may be unfair but I had the impression that the owner will cut any corners that he can. Overall very bad dining experience."}
{"text":"Went for my brother in law's Birthday .Always great food but assistant manager served us and he was very unfriendly. Expected a tip, complained about separating the bill, had staff taking away our utensils, plates, and cleaning the table before all of our food had come. I am very disappointed with the service we received and doubt I will be back because of the experience."}
{"text":"Amazing selection, excellent management and really good food. We order all you can eat via pads, pretty cool and amazing for big groups."}
{"text":"Visited this place with a friend a few weeks ago and enjoyed ourselves immensely. The decor is delightfully bright.  The menu is extensive (one of the things I look for at an AYCE place) and they utilize iPad technology although it's not completely user friendly and still requires the server to come and confirm your order. Seems like an unnecessary step to me but that's the way it works there.  Food comes out quickly, generally hot but food can be a hit or miss. I specifically enjoyed the sweet potato tempura sushi roll (yum!) And their cream puffs (warm on the outside, cool on the inside).  Price point was reasonable and they do offer a yelp discount. Wouldn't travel out of my way to come back but would return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Finally, i decided to give this place a try, since i pass by here twice a day.  Amazing decor, very good service. Especially when i told our server, it was my first time there, she explained how the ipad worked for ordering.  Good selection. Ordered the pad thai, korean bbq ribs, kung pao chicken, spicy fried rice and sushi. Service was good overall. Price was not bad. Went for lunch on a weekday, so AYCE for under $40 for 2 people with drinks was a decent bargain, especially for the different types of food we ordered. Yes, the portions are small, however, gives you a chance to try different items on the menu."}
{"text":"The staff is not very friendly and half of the time they don't fully bring the order. Food is okay nothing to extraordinary. Decor is really nice though."}
{"text":"We decided to try this new concept restaurant located next to the original Cynthia's Restaurant in Newmarket for lunch. New to the idea of ordering by iPad, we were a little unsure at first how to order, but with a little help from wait staff, we managed to enjoy this style quite happily. The decor is lovely. Service is very fast. The menu extensive, especially if you like sushi/seafood. The food overall is quite nice, with intriguing serving dishes. The price was right for \"all you can eat\". Attitude of staff was awkward, not particularly welcoming or friendly....until the bill came, at which point a very friendly, chatty staff member took over. General impression: Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here! Amazing food and amazing atmosphere. Sushi is always fresh and they have amazing food. Hey go above and beyond to accommodate you. And when it's your birthday they even sing to you and give you a free lamb rack or lobster (which all you can eat you have to pay $5-$7 extra for)"}
{"text":"We had lunch there.  Dishes were fairly good but small portions and not spectacular. So the dishes were pricey.  Charged about $3 for a bowl of white rice and about $2 each for tea.  Shocked that they charged tea. Given the large number of great Chinese restaurants in GTA, there is no reason to come back."}
{"text":"Very nice surprise! Tbh, restaurants that serve more than 1 Asian cuisines have a horrible rep, ESPECIALLY those that serve both East Asian AND Southeastern Asian food.  So when I first came seeing the sign and knowing its in Newmarket, I expected Mandarin quality food. You order on iPads and food came promptly. Portions are reasonable and they don't over stuff you. Everything tasted delightful, fish was fresh, meats seasoned and cooked beautifully.  Variety was also unbeatable, with all of your conventional AYCE sushi offerings to Manchuwok classics. We only came for the sushi but I can imagine some locals really digging the cheap Chinese. I must say, I am so surprised there were compliments on the decor. This whole restaurant seems to have an identity crisis not knowing what it wants to be. There are Asian inspired wall murals but tacky disco like booths and lighting. It's washrooms has a competing pattern in every corner - think classy marble wall tiles with COW patterned floor tiles. You have waitresses dress like maids but others in kimonos. It tries to be too much at the same time and is just not tasteful."}
{"text":"I would like to give 4 stars for food and service. The issue is that they did not accept my check in offer 10%discount. Not sure why, company policy was the response I received. Unfortunately I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to Cynthia's Paradise a couple of times and have yet to be disappointed in anything! So far, this is the only place I could get my date to enjoy that has any mention of the word sushi. There is something for everyone! Upon arrival, you are quickly seated and given an iPad to order from. The food comes out fast and hot & their sushi selection is great. You have your typical rolls and some very unusual, tasty rolls. Aside from sushi, we especially loved their bacon wrapped asparagus, the curry dishes and crab legs.  If you live in Newmarket, keep your eyes out for coupons in the newspaper. They usually have a 15% off hidden somewhere in there.  I will keep coming back, but only on week days as they have a different price for weekend buffets."}
{"text":"I went to Cynthia's for a friend's birthday dinner. Overall it was a pleasant experience! I don't like sushi and still found that they had a great variety for myself. My friends enjoyed the sushi. The food came out fast and was hot! The portions were a good size. The caesar pawn was the best thing on the menu, I really enjoyed it! The desserts were amazing!! The soft serve ice cream was the perfect way to end the meal!   The service was good, they always made sure waters were filled and empty plates were being cleared.   The design of the restaurant is beautiful! So much detail into everything! I fall in love with the lighting and the different sparkle designs!"}
{"text":"All you can eat we went on a weekday but the bill said weekend and holidays $27.99. And they said it was for decoration lol ok we just paid it anyways.   The food is really awesome served hot but was slow when we went and comes out super fast. You order everything on an iPad if they don't show u how to use it properly u could miss out on some items. Make sure u keep sliding across :)   Service was pretty good some servers more friendly then others. They where closing at 10:00pm they last called our table at 9:15pm. Must be in a rush. Only bad thing they started sweeping around and mopping around our table at 9:30 like right infront of our table as we ate. Not so yummy food anymore with a stinky mop. The decor is very nice modern gothic or something like that."}
{"text":"Yet another disappointing AYCE.. These are a dime a Dozen. Came here against my better judgment because my parents neighbours had recommended it.  Yes it's cheap, but to be honest it was my first red flag when I heard the pRice because cheap does not usually equate to fresh and good quality sushi. My gut feeling was spot on.. The sushi was definitely cheap and I don't mean that in a good way. I will not be back. Can someone tell me why everyone is so excited when AYCE is cheap (and the menu is on an iPad!!!), even when that means the food is sub par? I don't care how Cheap it is, it's still a waste of money if I don't enjoy it and I'll sacrifice an ipad menu for quality food any day.  Ps: Newmarket has good sushi, dare to find it :)"}
{"text":"Very fresh food, fast service and has verious asian style all you can eat. Just a little pricy, around $30 before tax and gratitude."}
{"text":"We're pretty much regulars at this AYCE restaurant that serves a myriad of Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Thai dishes. The sashimi is above average in quality for an AYCE spot in Newmarket and iPad menu offers a fairly large selection of hot dishes for those that may be adverse to raw fish. The Japanese beef cubes are one of our faves here! The torched sushi is a bit disappointing because the huge dollop of mayo on top masks most of the flavours from the fish. Most other items on the menu are common favourites found at other AYCE places and they do it fairly well here.  The place is usually pretty busy, especially weekends, so make sure to make reservations if you don't want to wait. Service is generally pretty good - we love getting Fanny as our waitress as she's super attentive and friendly. The managers seem to be a little stuck up though and I wish they would stop singing the birthday songs themselves. Overall, good place if you're craving sushi and other asian dishes. It is a little on the pricey side but that's becoming more common for uptown AYCE sushi spots. Just remember to check in on Yelp for the 10% discount!"}
{"text":"I've been here when they first opened, and my how things have changed. As much as we like Cynthia's other restaurant in the same plaza, we can accept that we won't get the same service and quality at an all you can eat restaurant.   The decor is still pretty cool looking, and the doors to the washrooms are no touch, which is a great feature, but the food has gone downhill since our last visit, enough that this will most surely be our last visit.   The fish was cut very thin, the maki seemed to have been made from pieces that were too small to serve, and some barely had any fish in them at all. Being a multi Asian fusion restaurant, they also have some dim sum items on their menu, I ordered the siu mai, and ha gow, the siu mai was so terrible I couldn't force myself to finish it, luckily I only ordered 4 pieces. The calamari was brown, my daughter usually loves calamari, she took one bite and handed to me in disgust.   The servers were not very friendly except for one. The rest seemed like we were an inconvenience to them.   I didn't feel so good after we left here, usually it's because I've eaten too much, but that was definitely not the issue, as I barely wanted to eat anything.   The servers were also making so much noise clanging plates, that it was difficult to have any kind of conversation.   Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE's that I've been to - higher end decor and staff seemed to be better trained then a typical AYCE.   They have unique dishes (blow torched sushi) and their cooked dishes are better prepared and better tasting then most.    It's not cheap and on the high end of AYCE but for the few bucks it's worth it in my opinion.    Would go again with groups."}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed our AYCE lunch today. Food is fresh, delicious, well presented, pleasant decor, clean washrooms, good service. I wish we knew about 10% discount for Yelpers. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here. This is my favourite spot in Newmarket when we don't want to drive anywhere else.   The restaurant has a nice ambience and atmosphere. You are greeted as soon as you walk through the doors.  The price is a little bit pricy but can't complain. They have iPads, waiters and waitress that are super attentive and the food selection is great! There is nothing on the menu that I do not like! Everything is so delicious!   Do try the honey garlic fried crispy tofu and the herb and garlic shrimps! It is so good!   Service part. There was only two occasions when we had a server who did not speak much English. Super surprised that she brought us the wrong thing when we asked for wasabi and she looked like she didn't understand but I don't see her there anymore. Last Saturday, we had an amazing waitress named Susan. She was super quick and polite and when our desserts did not come, she took the initiative to grab it for our table and the table beside us. Orders usually go to the back and the back server hands us the food but they missed our order. It was super busy but it was just ice cream that we were waiting on for a couple of minutes. While we were eating, one of the back servers dropped a tray of two makis on our table and I'm telling him that it is not ours and showed the iPad order to him but he still did not understand and my BF used hand gestures to say \"No\". Susan was great and the food was delicious , still a five star for me!  TIP: if you are planning to come here, do make reservations a head of time, so much easier and saves you so much time! You wouldn't want to wait for half an hour or longer on evenings! You can even call a couple hours ahead just to reserve your table!"}
{"text":"Cynthia's Paradise is an AYCE Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Thai restaurant. Typically I'm skeptical about places that specialize in more than one type of cuisine, since you would require a kick butt team or one heck of a worldly Chef, and few places can afford either. But there are many places like this all over Toronto and the GTA and they all do a decent job with their dishes, so this combo of cuisine is one of my few exceptions where I would dine at.  The decor is dated by a couple of decades, but still modern enough with clean lines and warm tones. In the evenings the lighting is dimmed to enhance the ambiance and provide a more intimate setting. There are motion sensors that automatically open the main entrance door once you pass the storm door. The washrooms doors are also automatic inside and out, triggered by a motion sensor to the right of it.  Like many other Buffets, seating times are limited to 2 hours and the menu stipulates (rarely enforced) that wasted food will be charged at full price for the dish. Ordering is done via iPad tablet by selecting the picture of the dish, then entering the desired quantity. When you're done, you submit the order and the wait staff will review it, then confirm it by entering their employee code. This can be done as many times as you like during the course of your seating.  Before I continue, a couple of tips: If you can, go in larger groups (6 or more). This enables you to be able to try a larger variety of dishes you never had before (Everyone has a bite, if you like it, order more, if not, well then the pain was contained to only that tasting). The other tip is don't order everything at once. This takes some practice and skill, but if you time it right, you'll be constantly eating, and food will always be hot and fresh. If you're into appetizers, select those immediately and submit them. These will come out fairly quickly as most require minimal preparation. If you're into Sushi/Sashimi do that next. This is prepared by the sushi chefs. While this also doesn't take long, the Sushi bar is often behind on orders (due to volume) so it will also take longer than you would anticipate getting it. After submitting that, immediately submit your cooked foods as this goes to the kitchen. Remember, don't order mass quantities of food, there's no limit to the number of orders you can submit. I would submit 2-3 consecutive rounds of kitchen foods as they will most likely come out before your initial Sushi/Sashimi order you placed earlier. Then submit a second round of Sushi. By this time, food would have already been flowing and you would have enough to feed a basketball team. But if your party has the appetite of a football team, now would be the time to peruse the menu for anything you want repeats of. Mix and match both the kitchen and sushi bar items. Once food from this last round begins to appear at your table, it's time to peruse the menu for dessert options and submit those.  I know that I have not reviewed any actual dishes, but there are just too many to go over. Some of my favourites are: Sashimi (Red Tuna, Octopus, Red Snapper, Mackerel (fishy), Salmon, Scallop, Beef Tataki); Sushi (Salmon Roe); Rolls (Spicy Tuna Crispy, Spicy Salmon Crispy; Spider); Kitchen: Salmon Belly, Enoki Beef, Mango Shrimp, Kalbi, Stir Fried Beef w/diced garlic, Japanese Fried Rice, Gyoza; Desserts: Fried Coconut Milk. Things I stay away from: White Tuna Sushi/Sashimi, any dish in Cheese Sauce. Things that are just \"meh\": Serf Clam, any dish with Crab Meat, all Tempura (batter is not tempura), all duck dishes.  Overall, Cynthia's paradise is one of my go to restaurants in Newmarket. I try to make the pilgrimage out here at least once per year. There are a few reasons why I come back, the first is that they don't over-portion their dishes (so you can actually come here with any size group). Large portions are terrible for small groups and fuels waste (you'll be full after a couple of dishes at best, and have little variety). The other reason is variety, they have an extensive array of both cooked and raw foods to satisfy many different appetites. Lastly, their Chefs are always coming up with at least a couple of new dishes. If they're popular enough, they remain as a staple on the menu. if not, then they move onto something new or trendy. Over the years, the price has inflated dramatically, but the quality of their food has remained consistent, and for that, I'm a fan..."}
{"text":"The menu is vast and spans from sushi to general Tao chicken. The staff are friendly and i love the iPad ordering system. Only complaint I have is the steep price for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"The foods good, service could definitely use some improvements.    Definitely make a note or a clear sign if you are going to threaten the customer with the left overs. Not a single sign or communication.   The sever offered: instead of giving you the 10% off, I will not charge you for the left overs.  I was shocked.    Food: 4/5 Service: 0/5"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Family came from another town and still talk about this place"}
{"text":"We went for dinner on Christmas day and there were many people dinning.  The portions have gotten bigger since they opened. The server didn't really want to be there on Christmas. The food, as so many people have already stated, is superb! A little pricey, but worth the extra $$$! The little deserts they have, are just the final touch you need after your meal. A \"must go\" place."}
{"text":"Sushi is pretty decent. The selection is vast. The spicy salmon maki and hand roll is quite bit on the heavy side with a thick layer of rice. The dessert selection is interesting and of a decent variety. The sesame balls are highly recommended as they are made fresh with a good portion of lotus paste. Price at lunch is par for the course for this type of restaurant. Dinner is on the pricier side but has a further expanded menu. One thing is certain it is a better bet than the Mandarin around the corner."}
{"text":"Quality food for a buffet. They certainly don't skimp on the meat in their dishes. Service was moderately quick but they kept mixing up our order and \"forgetting\" about items like so many AYCE tend to."}
