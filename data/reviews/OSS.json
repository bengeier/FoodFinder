{"text":"Good for college kids but doesn't apply to others. Don't go out of your way. It is just average."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday and it was amazing! 

Great patio area in the back to have lunch, very polite attentive staff, and delicious food. 

Loved the buffalo curds, fundido and had one more...the doner? All great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went on a Badger game day. Had a delicious chili cheese dog and fantastic lightly battered cheddar curds that melted in my mouth. The staff gave me an extra third glass of beer when the keg ran out leaving me only 20 drops short of a full pour. They cleared our table and checked on us multiple times. Thanks OSS! What a great experience!"}
{"text":"Overrated. These positive reviews have to be contrived.  One of the worst attempts at a Chicago dog.  Go to Greenbush pizza next door instead if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I just had my first OSS sausage experience. I must say I do not typically gravitate towards sausage when choosing meals so I was skeptical given OSS's menu. Although they offer burger substitutes, I thought I would stick with their namesake and ordered a speciality sausage. My partner and I loved our fries and respective meals. We also ordered cocktails which were strong, tasty and cheap! I could see going back just for drinks and board games (which they have near the bar). 

What I liked most about OSS was the service and vibe. It manages to have a very cool atmosphere while still having friendly, attentive and quick staff. At other Madison establishments I often think these two attributes (trendy verse service) are in conflict but OSS manages to capture both perfectly."}
{"text":"Very cool little place. Got the \"sloppy dog\" and of course cheese curds. Tasted great and great atmosphere. Great service too!"}
{"text":"OSS keeps a Wisconsin tradition going. I ate the classic bratwurst with fried cheese curds. I topped my bratwurst with kraut, peppers and onions. They got it right. I'll be back again to try their chorizo."}
{"text":"OSS is great, especially because it is such a good value (less than $10). I've tried several of their specials and signatures, and most of them are either good or delicious and only one was disappointing. The Morel special was incredible. The cheese curds were tasty, but not as good as Graze. This place could easily get 5 stars, but sometimes the toppings are carelessly assembled and out of balance or the Buns are served soggy. At times, the service was almost overbearing, but they just opened and are pretty enthusiastic. All in all, OSS is a casual and fun place to hang out at. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"food is very good.  hot dogs have crunch, delicious toppings.  place is really only for those who live close.  no parking, long walk."}
{"text":"The bahn mi was awesome! The pickled veggies were on point. Perfectly sweet, crunchy with the sausage balancing it out."}
{"text":"I thought the word \"hipster chic\" best describes OSS. I had the drunken ducky and it was good. I would have preferred a little less cranberry, but the sausage was great. The service was also very attentive."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good dog driving through Madison. Came into the place excited and really liking the staff, intention, and ambiance. Left reasonably satisfied, though would likely venture a different location rather than return next time.

We got the Drunky Ducky, Banh Mi, and Chicago Style Dog.

Drunky Ducky - the Maple Bourbon flavored Duck sausage didn't stand a chance next to the heavy/ syrupy cranberry sauce. Great idea but ended up tasting like a jelly sandwich with a little mustard, onion, and oh yea, a sausage.

Chicago Style Dog - all around a good dog but the the toppings and huge volume of bread made every bite wanting more dog.

Banh Mi - definitely favorite of the three. Unique in the fact that it tastes like a fairly good Bahn Mi sandwich, except, it's a hot dog...

Biggest gripe is with the buns; soft and bleach white but too big in comparison to the dog, would be better smaller and toasted/ a little crispy. The sausages are so good but get lost in the bread.


Would return but wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Um, yes please!  Love this place.  I always get the Banh Mi signature sausage which is off the hook!  OSS reminds me of a sausage place I used to go to in Alameda, CA called \"Doggy Style\". No joke, that was the name.  It's also very similar to Japadog in Vancouver.  

I've also tried the Doner Kebab which was good, and hubby tried the Fundido, which he said was awesome!  This is one of those places where you'll want to try every type of sausage sandwich they offer.  If you're not a big eater, one sandwich should be enough for you, but if you're a little piggy like me, than you'll want two.  

You can tell the owners have really given a lot of thought to this place once you step inside.  Make sure to check out the unique tables and decorations throughout. I believe they also have an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"1st time visitors to this wonderful establishment. My husband ordered the sloppy dog and finished every bite. I ordered the Mac n cheese dog and it was wonderful paired with the apple cider on tap. My kids gobbled up both orders of cheese curds. To top things off, Josh, exceeded our expectations for customer service. He checked on us a few times and walked us through the menu when ordering."}
{"text":"My 20 something son raved about this place! and he doesn't rave about anything. Unique steam punk interior - cool. Hot dogs?not just hot dogs, Old School Stuffed meat - each one made with local ingredients and specific meat combination for each dish. I had the Bahn-Mi - very delicious, served with some of the best fries I've ever had. The staff was into the concept and were excited about explaining the menu. Definitely will go back. We went on the weekend for lunch, not a game day, students hadn't moved in yet, so it wasn't busy and we parked across the street. Given that it is on Regent you have to be creative if you need parking. But very much worth the hassle. Great concept for a restaurant, I think it will be wildly successful when everyone finds out about it."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped into OSS on a Sunday afternoon. We loved the food! Had 3 different sausages and buffalo cheese curds- all very good! Staff was very friendly and knowledgable and the place is clean and comfortable inside. Definitely planning to go back."}
{"text":"I visited OSS on a Wednesday afternoon in November 2015. I ordered one of their weekly special \"The Cheesemaker\", fries, and an iced tea. 

The Cheesemaker was excellent, and the hand cut fries were plentiful and very good. Tables held a variety of condiments, and the restaurant was clean. The decor is steampunk, with fun decorations, and had both tables and a counter to sit at. The music was a variety of rock, noticeable, but not too loud.

The service was outstanding! When I asked a question the server didn't know the answer to, he called out someone from the kitchen who not only knew the answer, but explained the origin of the restaurant, and their unique menu, which changes daily.

The \"Cheesemaker\"  $6.50
A Hoesly's Meats Smoked Braunschweiger Bratwurst topped with Local Swiss Cheese, Red Onion Slices, Pickle Spear, & Baumgartner Cheese Store & Tavern Horseradish Brown Mustard."}
{"text":"Every new restaurant has growing pains. This one is no different.

A coworker and I went for lunch on a Friday. We got there at 11:10 to find the doors still locked. After trying to pry them open a few times a worker came and opened them for us, apologizing and feeling probably a little bad he forgot to unlock them. Not a huge deal but definitely the sign of a new place.

The menu was very nicely labelled and easy to read and ordering was not an issue. The place is cash only, but there is a fee-free ATM inside to grab some cash.

A gentleman that ordered after us attempted to pay with a $100. The cashier was pretty nervous as he said he didn't deal with a bill that size before and didn't know if there was special procedure. The customer ended up paying in singles. Another sign of a new restaurant.

Like a chipotle the kitchen is in plain view for the customers to see. You would think employees that are handling cooked food would be wearing gloves while preparing the orders. Nope, not here. Even the manager snagged a few of my fries to eat himself while I was watching. Extremely unprofessional and unsanitary (though he did offer us some overcooked cheese curds, so that's good I guess?).

The food was great. The chicago dog very authentic (being from chicagoland) and the fries were seasoned and cooked for just the right amount of time. A little pricey at $7.50* for the combo, but good nonetheless.

The thing that irked me with this place was the food handling. I expect employees to be gloved when making food and packing it into containers, especially when it's done right in front of the customer. Up the service and sanitation a bit and this place will get a 5 star review.

*-Tax is included in the price on the menu board. A HUGE plus."}
{"text":"Terrific all around. First visit during orientation, will certainly not be our last. Can't wait to return. From the excellent vibe, super-friendly and accommodating staff to the most excellent food all in our group agreed that OSS is the real deal. When our son asked if they could whip up a bacon-wrapped brat, the main guy at the counter looked back at the guys working their magic on grill, gave a big smile and the request was not only readily granted but greeted with respect of fellow lovers of the pig. Also not to be missed: their fried cheese curds w/ the various dipping sauces. Not a flight or two of their well-thought out beer selections. Would give them six stars if we could."}
{"text":"I couldn't help myself and I went back two days after my initial review and ate in instead of taking it to go. I ordered The \"Dining Room\" and fries. The Dining Room was described as \"A Habanero spiced pork sausage, topped with a roasted poblano sour cream, crispy tortilla strips, and fresh cilantro.\" I expected it to be spicy and delicious. It was barely spicy and the sausage was so dry I couldn't finish my last bite. I don't know if the etiquette is that I should have asked for something different, but I didn't want to give up after the first bite. Either way, I was very disappointed because I like my sausages to be nice and juicy. 

Now about the fries: 
They were a very good value. They had good flavor. However, my personal preference is that fries are crispy. These fries seemed to be flash fried. They had a nice color but they were soft and mushy. I took them back to the office and my coworker ate them, so maybe you'll like them if you like fries that aren't crispy.

I really wanted to like this place, but I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"OSS follows its natural energy; the five stars doesn't mean its the best restaurant, rather it is a great example of the style.  Simple, fun, relaxed.

Creative brat combos at a reasonable price with some nice variety, but not to  excess.  Beer taps are limited but good (esp. Karben 4).  Decor playful Steampunk vibe.  The bun is too big, but it is fresh and they're working on it.  We live in walking distance and hit it up one a month for lunch.  Perfect nap fuel."}
{"text":"OSS has great food, awesome cheese curds and great weekly specials. I recommend this place if your looking for a good, and quick, bite to eat."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch and found it very tasty. I had the \"egg roll\" sausage, which was topped with Chinese-style vegetables and a drizzle of slightly spicy honey mustard and crowned with little fried wonton-like crunchies. My boyfriend had the bahn mi sausage, which was generously topped with peppers, daikon radishes, cilantro, carrots, and chili mayo. The cheese curds were nice and gooey. 

Apparently there will be somewhat of a rotating menu, so while I'm not sure we'll always be able to get these particular sausages, there'll be other intriguing things to try. I might try the vegan sausages next time. 

Other features - community style tables (but individual chairs rather than a bench), sturdy Mason jars for our water, nifty decor with a welcoming feel. Looking forward to going there again :)"}
{"text":"Great service helpful restaurant personnel complete explanation of menus. Great muddled old fashioned, cheese curds freshly battered and tasty chili. Dog friendly patio outside. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"OSS has a Very Cool Atmosphere and decoration!!!! The service is great and friendly!! The food is fabulous, the house made fries are really good with a lot of flavor!! The cheese curds are also great crunchy in the outside and gooy cheese in the inside!!! The sausages are spectacular with great taste!! I really enjoyed how there sausages are chosen by other foods around the country ! For example a Kabab sausage so good!!! I really hope to return to OSS!!"}
{"text":"They have really tasty cheese curds! Feel like it is the best in Madison!!! Definitely recommend to everyone!

Also their brat is good. Some of the flavor(probably because of different seasonings) are bit strange but overall it is really good~!"}
{"text":"They fixed their buns! They're now delicious and the perfect level of crisp and soft. Love this place so much. Especially their poutine and soups! It's hard to find good poutine outside of Canada but they definitely do it right here. I also love the tap selection. The beers pair perfectly with the sausages."}
{"text":"This place was great and exactly as described. Many delicious original and special sausages for a great price (most sausages are under $8). They also have two vegan sausages. My sister tried the applewood and sage with a sweet mustard and enjoyed it. 

It's a great space too. Well designed with gears and welded metal design (almost steampunk? But not quite?). Lots of clever \"OSS\" meanings too including: Ohio State Sucks and Oink, Sausage, Served  

The manager is phenomenal. He is so enthusiastic and knowledgable. If you have any questions ask him and he will happily help you."}
{"text":"Fantastic service
Wild mushroom ragout was to die for
Wild mushroom and leek soup totally awesome!"}
{"text":"Great service, they helped with the menu, very friendly. good atmosphere. Cheese curds were great, light crunchy batter. Tried the fried bacon dogs, delicious. Good music."}
{"text":"I had lunch for the first time at OSS today. The counter man was friendly and very excited. We ordered cheese curds and a bahn mi sausage. The bahn mi sausage was excellent with fresh cilantro, jalapeños and pickled veggies. I am not typically a sausage fan but I would definitely eat that again. 

The cheese curds we did not finish. The cheese curds  were battered in a greasy tempura like coating. They got tossed after a few bites."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great service - they're happy to make a recommendation if you have trouble choosing from one of their unique sausages. I had the donner kabob today (my second visit) - a Mediterranean seasoned lamb and chicken sausage with fresh cucumbers, cabbage, onions, spicy mayo.  Perfectly cooked, juicy, nice balance of flavors, satisfying without feeling like a gut bomb. The side of fresh cut fries and cold craft brew were the perfect accompaniment. I'm going back when I'm not in a hurry to have a couple of cold brews while playing something from their great selection of board games with the wife (who's a fan of their vegetarian options)."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious food. The Bahn Mi was awesome! I personally didn't care for the cheese curds. They had a thick, soft breading and were very different from other curds I have had. The sweet and hot mustard sauce with the curds was great, however. Also, the staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have tons of options including veggie ones for my non meat eating partner. The tikka masala cheese curd special from 6 months ago is still something I think about. Get a sausage, some cheese curds, a drink, and grab the sushi go card game and have one of the most laid back/whimsical lunches madison has to offer. The patio during the summer is great too."}
{"text":"Gooey-est cheese curds ever, beer in a mason jar, and the bahn mi brat!!! Ended up having to get a second helping of everything for everyone at our table. 

I can NEVER find parking each time I've tried revisiting  --- only complaint."}
{"text":"I appreciate the unique idea behind this restaurant and the different weenie recipes in general. The menu is fascinating.

The Environment. This place is clean. After already recognizing this, we happened to stay past close and witnessed their extremely thorough cleaning process. Also, their decor is steampunk, which you don't see everywhere.

The Food & Drink. I had the bahn mi, which was excellently spicy and fresh. My partner had some \"special\" that looked and tasted really messy, salty, and goopy hangover-y. The curds were enormous and all cheese; almost no breading. Definitely different. The beer options were stellar for the setting, I had a hard time deciding.

In the end, I just not a big fan of brats and dogs BUT staff, cleanliness, creativity, decor, beer trumped it."}
{"text":"Great place- fun decor, nice outside seating, and definitely the best cheese curds in town.  I also love the tiny mason jars they use for beer flights."}
{"text":"OSS had the best cold watermelon soup everrrrr! I tried it a few months ago and it was first time I've even heard of cold soups or watermelon soups but it was sooooo good!!! The Bahn Mi sandwich wasn't one of my favourites but I really like their fries!!! The Doner Kebab is pretty good and Veal Brat was pretty good too! The decor in this place is really unique and pretty cool. I really liked how laid back it was. I gave it 4 stars because the Bahn Mi sandwich was... not what I expected but don't let that stop you from trying it!! You might like it but it wasn't for me. The staff is friendly and extremely helpful! The service is fast! Their house made sauces were good too!! They make some of their dipping sauce in house but I wish they would give you more sauce if they are going to charge you for it. If you're craving fries and brats, come here!! They even deliver!"}
{"text":"Totally awesome hangout spot hidden near university, with a small beer garden out in the back. Food is delicious, everything is homemade. I ordered the fundido and would order again. Also both the cheesecurds and fries are one of the best in town!"}
{"text":"Best cheesecurds in the town! They just melt inside your mouth. The sausages are delicious too. Do try both."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Madison, my husband and I wanted a truly Sconnie meal of brats and cheese curds. Only problem is- we're vegetarian! After a brief search, we found out that OSS has veggie brats so we headed over. What a cool concept. I tried the chipotle Italian sausage on the Mac Dog menu item, which is a brat covered in a macaroni and cheese mixture with tomatoes and bread crumbs. I mean, why not? So good and creative! My husband got the same veggie sausage covered with a jalapeño cheddar sauce with grilled jalapeños on top. We got fries and fried cheese curds on the side with a nice spicy mustard sauce. Great beer selection, too, served in cute mason jars. The staff was friendly and fun, answering all of our questions about the menu. The back patio was a nice place to enjoy the cooler evening weather."}
{"text":"I would recommend. Good prices and small, but good, selection of draft beer. If you are not wanting a hot dog, don't go because that is the main course. Also has a nice rear courtyard area for grubbing down which is pretty sheltered."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a find!  OSS has an excellent selection of very interesting and good quality sausages prepared in creative ways.    I keep having the Bahn Mi because it is so over the top delicious but my partner has tried and loved several other locally sourced sausages.  Love the steampunk decor!!!  It is now on our list of dependably good meals.  You could drive by this place many times without recognizing it as a restaurant.  It's truly a \"hidden\" gem!   Oh, and the staff are very knowledgable about sausage and friendly!"}
{"text":"We ordered three entrees and cheese curds between the two of us: Bahn Mi, Tika Masala, and Korean. Tiki was fave, but all rocked. Cheese curds were lights out, best of show. Can't wait to return to try others!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sausages in a driving rain storm yesterday. Had to get them to go as I was parked illegally while towing my boat through town.  Enjoyed the Korean dog.  I also had a wiscago dog and thought it was good. Fries were great. The chili was a bit sweet. Overall excellent."}
{"text":"Their outdoor patio is a hidden treasure. As is their delicious grub! Some of the best cheese curds (many will say the best) that Madison has to offer. Especially delicious with the Sriracha Mayo. They also have a great beer selection (both tap and bottles). 

I've also endulged in the Banh Mi and Doner Kebab sausages. The Doner Kebab is my favorite, but the Banh Mi is a close second. They are both delicious, along with the rest of their menu I'm sure. I've also heard good things about their vegan options, and they have gluten free buns!

This place may seem out of the way or difficult to get to, but it is worth the trip. Plus, you can park across the street after 5 PM! So you really have no excuse. You should just go here."}
{"text":"I've visited OSS three times and I've had a great experience each time. They have a terrific selection of vegetarian/vegan sausages, and they have some of the best cheese curds in all of Madison. The atmosphere is fun and clean and the employees are always extremely friendly. Previously, they did not accept credit cards, but they do now."}
{"text":"Hot dogs, polish sausage, brats all done well with some atmosphere. Tried the Chicago dog and the Polish sausage. Tasty, well prepared. No relish on the Chicago dog however.  But still good.  If there is a food item that Madison cries out for it is a good place for hot dogs and Italian beef.  OSS is filling a lot of that void.   Hits: friendly staff, prices are ok a tad high for the food. $4.50 for a hot dog seems a little high. Beer is served as well. Misses: prices are just a little high, noisy to carry on a conversation. I think if you added some sound deadening panels would improve the sound. No credit cards you have to pay cash or use the ATM inside to get the cash. No parking, need to borrow a space at Dean across the street. Wi-fi is free but need to have a mad city wifi account. Not provided by OSS."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times, and for the most part the food has been great. I usually get the same thing - the Wiscago dog and cheese curds. The hot dog is as close to a Chicago dog as you can find in Madison. Every time, except for the one time it was cold, has been delicious. The cheese curds are fresh battered and come with ranch. They are some of the best cheese curds in the city - seriously. Service is friendly. However, when they are busy you can expect a little wait. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat you should consider stopping in."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  We stopped here during a campus tour of UW and it was not what I expected. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable,  the food is great and the place is clean. Not what I expected from a place near campus. 

I think the sausages/sandwiches are every bit as good as Hot Doug's was in Chicago.

We had the Banh Mi, Donner Kebab and bacon wrapped deep fried hot dog. We will be back when we are in Madison again."}
{"text":"tasty food and great price! I ordered cheese curds and vegan for $9.5 The food here is more like snakes and good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"From Chicago, delighted at our stop here one afternoon! Came for: outside TV's to watch football and a dog-friendly beer garden. 

Won over by: 
Enchantingly nice staff! We braved several storm fronts to be able to watch football with the dog, and we had an amazing chic continue to bring out her umbrella and these guys kept smiling and helping us wipe the rain off our table and chairs! All 5 different OSS staff members who spoke to us were all mad rad, good people)! 

The food was also different and delcious, beers, cider, and bloody mary's all great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday.  Clean.  Lots of menu options.   Some interesting choices.  Nice to see several vegetarian/vegan options.   

Ordered the fries special and an apple-sage veggie dog \"Chicago-style\", and a Karben 4 Fantasy Factory IPA.  

The gent that took my order was helpful and patient as I was trying to figure out the pretty extensive menu.  Since it was a nice day he suggested I should sit outside and they would bring the meal out.  Also, the gent that brought out the meal and was bussing tables was friendly and efficient. (5 stars for service.)  

The outdoor area is roomy and comfortable.  It was sunny, and there was no shade so on a hot day it will get warm.  It was 80+ degrees out and I eventually went inside.  Some umbrellas or a canopy would be good, but don't get me wrong - NICE outdoor space, so Kudos OSS.  

The reason for four stars instead of five is twofold:  
1. The veggie dog was really, really dry - I think it was over-cooked and that also hurt the flavor.  I suspect the meat dogs and sausages are better.  Still, kudos for trying, and I am betting on another day. less cooked, it will be great.  (YES, I am looking forward to going back.)   
2. While they used excellent home-made relish and everything else was really good, the roll was fair at best.  Flavorless and a bit too hard - they recognized they do not use a poppyseed bun for the Chicago style.  Would be MUCH better if they did.  However, still not too bad, just not 5-star material on this day.

The fries were really outstanding.  I like crisp, shoestring fries.  These were the thicker, softer variety I usually avoid, but they were cooked perfectly and had just a little crunch, and they were topped perfectly with  mushroom, greens and a cheesy aoli that made it a great dish - not too much topping to overwhelm, but enough so that the whole plate was painted.  Also, they have a nice condiment basket, including vinegar.

Interior is very nice.  Entire place was very clean and clearly well managed.

Look forward to going back, and hope to be able to give a 5-star review.  Also want to try the cheese curds, as they looked very good and other Yelpers mentioned them.

I suspect"}
{"text":"Finally had an opportunity to try OSS and definitely worth the effort to get here...and to come back for seconds! 
Outstanding Sausage Selection might be one of the many things that OSS stands for. Others would be Our Sausage Shop or Original Sausage Specialties, but my two favorites....Ohio State Sucks (particularly pertinent this week) and Obviously Sparty Sucks! Whatever you want the acronym to be, it doesn't change what this place offers....great sausages and 'Or Sorta Sausage' (i.e. hot dogs and vegetarian options).
The  draw is finely crafted sausages with flavors that you could only get from a place that makes their own. Definitely one of the best smoked polish sausages I've ever had (not getting it with kraut is sacrilegious! ) and the deep fried (Kevin) Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog is a carnivorous nirvana! My DNA (the youngest one) opted for the Chicken Fajita and raved about how great the spicy chicken sausage, with mexican cuisine inspired flavors, tasted. Alas, it was already off the menu by my second visit.
With an ever changing menu of Original Special Selections (another OSS!!), as well as their menu standards, there is something to please even the most  Overly Selective Sybarite (again!). Patrons can even achieve limited time notoriety by submitting their own ideas for gastronomic originality with ideas for new sausage flavors. With sides of deep fried cheese curds or french fries, and great beer specials (today was BOGO!!), it's a great pre-Badger game day eatery.
The only knock on the place is that parking can be a pain but, depending on the time, Meriter's parking lot across the street can be used. However far away you have to park though, it will be well worth your effort!"}
{"text":"While this restaurant might not be on State Street, it definitely warrants a visit from every University of Wisconsin-Madison guest.

When our food arrived fresh off of the grill (or out of the fryer as the case may be), we dug in with vigor.  All three of our sausages were top-notch.  I personally got the Doner Kebab, a gyro-type sausage, and although it does not closely mimic the gyros that I am used to, the mixed lamb-chicken sausage paired beautifully with the cool slaw on top, and it featured just enough spice to keep things interesting.  The Phuket brings a Southeast Asian influence to the food with German roots, and the coconut pork sausage meshes with the curry-like toppings to make a delicious duet.  Although the menu may recommend that this sausage be adorned with Sriracha, give it a taste beforehand and decide for yourself; our party member that ordered this found that is was quite spicy enough without the addition of the extra chile sauce.  Finally for the sausage category, we had the Banh Mi, a pork sausage with a pickled vegetable slaw with jalapeno slices and chile mayo.  While pickled vegetables seem a go-to when working with sausage (i.e. sauerkraut), it was the chile mayo that tied the two halves nicely together.

While just the sausages might have been food enough on a regular day, we had an early and light lunch, so we ended up with sides, also. The fried cheese curds with a sweet hot mustard dipping sauce came with both the crispy crunch of the breading and the smoothness of the fine Wisconsin dairy product.  Next were the fries, which were a large portion, hot, and very well seasoned.  Finally, we got the baked potato soup, which had a creamy, cheesy upper layer and a lower layer that held well-cooked chunks of potato.

We also got a set of four 4 oz mason jars full of beer.  They offer a fairly large selection of beers here, many of which are locally-sourced from Wisconsin breweries.  Of the four that we tried, I'd favor the milk stout on nitro, but even that decision is a bit difficult due to all four being quality beers.

This restaurant has an undeniable commitment to theme.  Many of the different accoutrements of the shop had been branded, from the T-shirts with various meanings of the what the acronym O.S.S. Might stand for, to the devices which others might call lids.  Here, they are called On-top Spill Stoppers.  The décor in the restaurant was also very coherent, seeming as though you happened to be dining in a tinkerer's workshop, with hand-made bubblers in the windows, tables set on stacks of (fake) books, and  a gear motif throughout the room.  If you fancy a bit of leisurely visiting, there are a variety of board games sitting in a corner of the room.  There is also a very pretty outdoor patio in the back that hosts Wisconsin Badgers watch parties during football season.  The staff were very friendly, offering opinions on both the food and the beers, which they take seriously (but not too seriously). 

All in all, it was some seriously good food in a well-thought-out environment.  While I am just passing through, if I'm ever in the area, I'll be sure to stop by again."}
{"text":"Their buffalo cheese curds were fire! I could eat those all day. 

It's a cool little spot with nice staff and food."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch this morning with 2 other people in my group. Clean, small menu, fresh ingredients and great food. 
Food - I got the Banh Mi, absolutely delicious with the jalapeños to add in the right amount of spice. Loved it and will be getting this again for sure. My companions got a Chicago dog and a regular hot dog. They both loved it. Next time, we will do the fried dog, I'm sure it will be great crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Fries and cheese curds also done well. For vegans and vegetarians, they substitute the vegan dog in any of their signature dogs, so this place has variety :)
Decor - Love the industrial feel, casual and Midwestern. Very well done. They do have communal seating, so keep that in mind if you are looking for a quiet date night (although I feel it will be perfect if you are the fun kind). Plus, they have really paid attention to detail here, from mason jar glasses to serve you drinks and beer - it's the small things that make a difference. 
Staff are very helpful and guide us through. Many a time, I have walked into a place and wondered do I order first or sit down and I'm very lost. The folks here have great customer service. 
In all, a good addition to the Regent neighborhood, and I will go back for sure, especially since they will have a summer menu and I want to get as much of the Banh Mi as possible before they move it out :)"}
{"text":"I guess it is just a matter of perspective. When I think of going out to a restaurant, OSS just doesn't make my list. Ordering a brat, a dog, or a sausage feels like a food-cart item, rather than a sit-down meal. However, If I'm going out for a beer and want someplace that also offers tasty food options, then OSS moves to the top of my list.

As a bar, I like that OSS has an good variety of local tap selections. They offer both beers and ciders and they mix up the line-up so I don't get bored. The location on Regent Street is easy to access and I like the ambiance and the staff. It's a fun place to hang out with friends. As a bar, I really like that that they offer unusual food options such as an array of sausages that I can customize with a variety of tasty toppings. Plus the cheese curds and fries are tasty and don't break the bank.

So if you are going out for beers and you want a place that also offers tasty snacks then OSS is an excellent choice. If you're going out for a great meal, Madison offers a myriad of excellent (better) opportunities."}
{"text":"Insanely delicious cheese curds. The connection between OSS and Green County's cheese community is clear."}
{"text":"This should be a 5 star review! 
The place looks great, the people are friendly, and the food choices are amazing! So why only 3 stars? The reason is the lack of freshness. The jalapeños we not the only thing lacking freshness in my picture. So was the bun. The flavors were great for both of my sandwiches, but that could not make up for the stale buns.
Rule 1, if you are going to charge $5.50 for a brat, serve it fresh! Perhaps the bar crowd don't notice but those of us here at 6pm do.
Will I be back? A week maybe. Would I have been back if the food was fresh? Hell Ya!

Don't hate us yelpers. We only report our experiences. If it is lack luster, perhaps you should fix what you can. Will I be the only person who doesn't like stale buns and dried out veggies? Highly unlikely. You have done amazing, why did you compromise your quality?"}
{"text":"If you're on the fence about coming here, get your ass off the fence and come get some of the best sausage and cheese curds in America. That is all."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. Enjoyed it!  If in Madison you should grab a brat at OSS."}
{"text":"Go to this place and sit out on the patio. There are vegetarian options for your friends who aren't into brats. The staff is super friendly and the menu is interesting in a very good way. Not overrated. 100% worth a visit."}
{"text":"I got the Fresh-Battered Cheese Curds with Sweet & Hot Mustard, and thought they were delicious; however, my wife was not impressed because the dough they were fried in was so sweet. In fact, due to their dessert-level sweetness, I agree with her that these curds should not be called curds but instead be called fried grilled cheese or cheesy funnel cake.

Also, if you're looking for squeaky curds, look elsewhere. I definitely didn't mind the lack of squeak, but, again, that's because I felt like I was eating a fried grilled cheese rather than a cheese curd."}
{"text":"I got the vegan apple sage dog. After a couple bites of feeling like this is a very whatever hotdog I asked someone if I could see the ingredients for the vegan dog. It was Field Roast brand which was disappointing since its main ingredients are gluten and canola oil but at least they had a non-meat option from a credible brand.

My two friends liked the beef hot dogs and we thought the cheese curds were good. 

The optional topping options are very sad, mostly onion based and the bread is so-so. 
My friend said the poutine was mediocre and had an odd odor so we hardly touched it. 

Coming here made me miss Wiener Shop which had higher quality ingredients like avocado add-ons, a gluten-free bread option, and less-processed vegan tempeh dogs. 

Everything at OSS was okay and the people were nice but I think I'll stick to making myself hot dogs at home or go to the union where you get unlimited self-serve toppings."}
{"text":"1. Staff is super friendly. 
2. All sausages I've eaten have been fantastic  (Doner, Swedish meatball and a special boar/gruyere/mushroom ragout combo that I can't stop thinking about )
3. Good beer on tap
4. Feels so Sconnie in the best way 
5. Vibe is relaxed, cheerful and non pretentious"}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place, but it was pretty sub par in my opinion. But that might just be based off the fact that at costco I can get an awesome hot dog for $1.50. So paying at least $7.00 for a hot dog here I wasn't too thrilled. But first of all, we were drawn here due to a coupon my friend had gotten online for free cheese curds. of course they marketed themselves as the best in Madison, and honestly they were probably some of the worst I've had. they were less like a fried cheese curd and more like the batter o a corn dog, which threw me off. Then the food took forever to come out. Granted the people and service was excellent, but none of the food really blew me out of the water. I got the donor dong and i would rather just have a gyro instead. This review is just my opinion though and I believe everyone should be able to make their own, but if i had a limited amount in madison this would not be a must eat place to go."}
{"text":"How did we not know about OSS for the past 3 years?!! Creative, delicious hotdog concoctions, and they are absolute Cheese Curd Masters!"}
{"text":"So sad to hear that this place is closing in a few weeks. 

We came by one last time to enjoy one of the best hotdog spots in Madison. My favorite is the sloppy dog. Has a nice chilli in it, with two sausages, and some fritos. We also like the spicy Casablanca, which is a great lamb sausage. The cheese curds are fresh with a light crunch and the fries are double fried and crispy.

Do yourself a favor and swing by before it closes on 11/19"}
{"text":"I had the Mac and cheese hotdog and it was amazing. I also had a side of cheese curds and they were delicious. Would definitely eat again!"}
{"text":"Went to OSS for a late dinner this evening. A few things were a bit usual for this place, the entrance on the side instead of the front, cash only policy, and a very eclectic menu on \"sausages.\" The decor was pretty cool. We were the only table while we ate, but I should imagine a group of friends enjoying quick eat in this place. They serve alcohol, too. 

We had one chill hot dog and a banh mi. The service was super fast.  Both were really delicious. This is certainly a very Americanized version of Banh mi the Vietnamese sandwich, but I felt the green chili pepper and cilantro worked really well with the sausage.

My only reservation is its relative small portion size, especially if you compare OSS with subway or chipotle.  I know, i know, this might not be a fair comparison. OSS is still a pretty decent budget fast casual restaurant that I would return to."}
{"text":"Had the cheddar Jap, it was great. Great cheese but what else would you expect in Wisconsin. Curds were great also."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly guys that are happy to wax poetic about their menu. Locally sourced or produced meat tubes with garnishes made in house. They weren't exaggerating when they said best cheese curds in town, crispy with just the right amount of breading. We got the Banh Mi and the Doner Kebab. Both very tasty and an awesome new take on some favorites. I'd have gone a touch heavier on tzatziki with the Doner. They have tons of board games and a nice outdoor area too."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem. Fantastic service, creative selections, good beer selection, fun ambiance, and, oh yeah, delicious sausages. The smoked polish was awesome - hot, fresh, cracking skin, rich in flavor. Yum. The chorizo was a little disappointing - not that flavorful- but the doner kebab was awesome. The cheese curds were tasty but not as crispy on the outside as they should be - they were on the soft/greasy side. The handcut fries were yummy; not sure why they didn't come with dipping sauce the same way the curds did. 

Special kudos for the helpful, funny, perky-without-being-obnoxious cashier/server. She was great. 

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best sausage offering in Madison! We have only done delivery and we gave five stars. We can only imagine that dining in would be even better. The grilled hot dog with sauerkraut and tomatoes was my choice, simple yet yummy! My husband loved the doner and Julie Child! The cheese curds are great! Only wish that the serving size was larger. Delivery is very speedy, and anyone we spoke with was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Fantastic sausage, great sides. This place has it all. The kids loved their bacon-wrapped deep-fried hot dogs, the brat I had was delicious, and the Doner Kebab sausage my wife had was awesome!"}
{"text":"The Fundido was really good - a spicy chorizo link with tortilla chips for crunch and cheese and peppers spilling out the end. Also really enjoyed the cheese curds. Maybe this is an amateur (read: non-Wisconsinian) move, but I ate the curds too soon and almost choked on the still hot, too-gooey cheese that wouldn't break off when I bit it. 

The real strength of OSS is the depth of options. The menu is loaded. I was just in Madison for the weekend, so I only had a chance to go once, but I could see this place being a five-star if you lived in Madison and had a chance to go through the full menu. There were at least four or five different sausages on the menu I'd have been happy with, and that's not counting building my own."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 or 4 times and it's really a great place to hang out, eat a snack, grab a beer, and play some board games.

Among their sausages, I particularly recommend the doner one. It really does taste like doner kebab. Their beer selection is nice. I personally hate the jar-shaped glasses and I think beer should never be served in them, but that's my thing. The food is really cheap, the beers not so much. The tables are quite sticky and that annoys me quite a bit. 

Overall a good place to bring friends for a chat and some fun (it's typically empty at night)."}
{"text":"Cool place with an eclectic menu. I had the Mac Dog which was pretty good, the cheese curds were amazing. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Visited OSS (Open Source Sausages) Madison on a Sunday afternoon for an early dinner and we were impressed from the start. The building looks old but renovated very nicely. Has a trendy 'gears' motif that is nice and welcoming. 

We were greeted as we walked in and checked out the ordering board of a selection of various sausages and sandwiches. Very creative menu going from regular sausages (hot dog, bratwurst, polish) to upscale combinations like a Banh Mi and a Drunky Ducky. SO many choices - I went with the Chicago Hot Dog (I know boring right...) and my wife got the Smoked Brat. The Chicago dog was very tasty, good sausage - but the bun to meat ratio seemed a bit off. My wife thought her's was ok too but probably wouldn't go with smoked next time as the flavor wasn't her style and the casing was a bit tough. We also ordered a special of the day, Buffalo Cheese Curds! Yum! those were really good and another unique idea.

What slight shortcomings there were in taste were more than made up by service and enthusiasm. The guy that took our order was very friendly and helpful. He brought the food out to us and even check on us to see if we needed anything else. Another manager/owner stopped by later and say HI as well and told us about a new outdoor patio/garden they would be adding very soon. 

We were really happy to have tried OSS and plan to return to try other menu options as well as check out the patio when its done. They guys running this place are doing things right and adjusting to make people happy along the way. Looking forward to stopping by again soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my son out of curiosity and left happy. Ordered and paid at the counter and decided to sit at the bar. Josh gave us a very thorough tour of the menu and filled us in on how the place was named, which was entertaining. 

We shared cheese curds and poutine. The curds were very good, and I recommend the Sriracha mayo dipping sauce because the ranch was the blandest ranch I've ever had. The poutine was good, but could have used a little more gravy. 

I had the Wiscago dog, which was ok, and he loved his mac n cheese dog. 

Beverages were served in large jars, which was a nice touch and prevented the need for refills."}
{"text":"Have you heard of vietnamese bahn mi sandwiches??? Well they have Bahn Mi Sausages! We also ordered the poutine, which was good, but not my favorite. Next time I want to try the cheese curds! Fun place to grab some food and THEY HAVE BOARD GAMES!"}
{"text":"Fantastic quality and pricing. I ordered the 1/3# burger and the banh mih and neither lasted more than 20 seconds in front of me for a total of $13. Also very quick service good beer selection and 24oz pours. Great spot."}
{"text":"I really needed a fresh glass of water and it was awesome. Large cups, lots of ice. The brats were dope too."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, a bit of a walk from campus.  Staff is super friendly.  

We got the poutine dog (monthly special), a vegan dog prepared mexican style, and fries.

Poutine dog: It was unique, but I probably wouldn't get it again.  Maybe gravy on a sausage isn't my thing.  If I go back I would try something more standard to judge OSS on its pure sausage merits. 

Fries: They were fine.

Vegan dog: very good. 

You can get most of the dogs prepared with a vegan sausage.  I almost wanted to give this place 5 stars just for that.  Allows carnivores and vegetarians to dine together in bliss."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place. Great brauts, great beer, friendly service, and a nice patio make this an instant Madison favorite."}
{"text":"Went to OSS for lunch today. We had hotdogs, fries, and cheese curds. Food was delicious, small portions on the fries and cheese curds but food was cheap very yummy. Restaurant has very nice decoration. They had a good selection of beers that they serve in mason jars. Be careful, the restaurant is Cash Only, so come prepared( they do have a fee free atm but it was a little finicky for me) ."}
{"text":"Our Sunday Savior is what I'll call OSS.

After a long drive, we were happy to arrive here yesterday. Among the items our group got: bahn mi dog, deep friend bacon dog, fundido dog, poutine, cheese curds and two sloppy dogs.

Everything was amazing, but I thought the sloppy dog was a little lackluster. They're going with a wow factor on this one (see photo), but the flavor just isn't that spectacular.

The cheese curds and poutine really hit the spot--fresh and flavorful without being a grease-bomb. The curds have that great funnel cake-like batter that takes you back to the best fair food of your childhood. The staff was super friendly and attentive, and they'll take care of you.

Thanks, OSS!"}
{"text":"I love OSS!

Not many places set up in a casual fast food style that serve brats. Where else better than in the heart of Wisconsin? Their brats and sausages are delish. Never been disappointed here. 

Love the interior decor, its pretty rad. They recently remodeled to add a larger bar. 

The deep fried cheese curds are top-notch, as well as the fries are amazing. I can't say enough about how great this place is, I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"RUN, don't walk to OSS. Do not pass Go, go directly to OSS. This place is outstanding on all fronts-food, service, ambiance. It was one of those rare places I wish I could just hang out in all day. I had the opportunity to sample their fine foods earlier this year at the Isthmus Beer and Cheese Fest and I have no idea what on earth took me so long to finally come by.

The people working were super friendly and the owner himself delivered our food. He also came by later to find out what we thought as well as explain a table game to us. Super awesome guy. I love when people seem genuinely excited you are enjoying their food.

Small but decent beer selection served up in mason jars-including the flight-served in teeny tiny mason jars. The music playing during our visit was a mix of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty and the like. Just great. It was way too hot/humid that day to sit outside but they do have an excellent patio out back. Stacks and stacks of board games near the windows. We have a ton of fun playing a table top version of air hockey but with a little chess piece type deal that worked via magnets.

The food is very obviously high quality and very fresh. I'm still dreaming of the Sriracha aioli dipping sauce that came with our cheese curds. And the roasted jalapeños on my cheddar jalapeño dog were just perfect. I can't wait to come back and work my way through the entire menu. Oh yes, OSS!"}
{"text":"Fast service, tasty food, friendly staff. Plenty of options without it being overwhelming."}
{"text":"Fun place and great dogs.  Had the doner and was wonderfully gyro garlicky.  Couldn't resist the fried cheese curds too but they were puffier than I imagined as cheese melted and oozed away.

Took my Dad and he loved the beer."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in town - I enjoyed these even more than the ones at The Old Fashioned! This is a fun little place to grab dinner with a couple of friends. They had stacks of table/card games and the perfect set up to play games. The decorations were rustic and quirky, which was perfect for some good ol' sausage! The sausage orders were very creative: bah mi, curry, mac n' cheese, and you can even build your own! I am a fan of their raspberry apple cider, and they also had a variety of beers! The only downside to this restaurant was the parking; it's close to downtown so parking wasn't easy to find!"}
{"text":"Solid average \"new\" sausage place. Some good traditional options, plenty of \"innovative\" options. Decent pricing, good location. Not amazing, but a perfectly good option for drunk food if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Who wants a hotdog? Hot dog!? You mean those pig feet, horse tongue, who knows what's in those things, childhood lunch of champions? I do, I do! Except OSS's versions are delicious and you won't find any of those childhood leftovers in their meats. I tried the mothership of the sausage realm, the Chicago Style Dog. It was delicious. They split the dog in half and put some nice grill marks on it. Then it's put into a soft bun and topped with all the classics, but remember don't add ketchup. It's not for this dog. My only complaint would be that the bun was not a poppy seed. I'm not sure if that's the original way of doing things, but whenever I think of a Chicago dog I think, poppy seed bun.

I also got an order of the fresh cut fries. The portion was good and the fries were really good! Take it from me, I cook fresh cut fries at events all over South Central Wisconsin.

The atmosphere was cool, but as this place progresses along I'd love to see the steam-punk look become more evolved and on everything. Get industrial with those napkin holders and that soda machine. It's a machine. Do to it what the steam-punk revolution would do to it. Make it aggressive and all metal-y.

Overall this place was really cool. If they stay open for Badger games and keep the beer flowing they will do really well."}
{"text":"There is simply nothing better than OSS cheese curds and every time we eat here its excellent, food,service, beer they get it right."}
{"text":"This place is great, definitely head in for the following dogs (will update as I try more, rated out of 5 with a 4.0 being good)

Banh Mi 4.5/5
Mac Dog 4.25/5
Cheddar Jalapeno 4/5
Italian 4.25/5

Specialty (Seasonal??) Sausages (may not be available)
Veal 4.5/5
Morel 4.75/5

Definitely try the fried snickers bites, they are theoretically gross (and literally heavy) but absolutely delicious. 

Loaded fries are also a great move here, possibly to share. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here based on a review on the Find Me Gluten Free app as I am gluten intolerant. They had a list of where they source their sausage from which is refreshing. They also have gluten free buns for their sausage and can tell you which things do and don't have gluten in them. I had the wiscago dog and my husband had the veal sausage and we both got fries. The fries were perfect and the hot dog was something I've been craving for what seems like years. My husbands veal dog was cooked perfectly and delicious as well. From where we sat we could see our food being cooked. They also had a cool atmosphere and lots of board games available so if you brought a group you could make a night of it and really just hang out there. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped into OSS for lunch around 11:30 a couple weeks ago after looking over the menu a few times in the past. We were especially excited for the weekly special ( Buffalo Cheese Curds) after reading reviews that raved about their curds! 

I ordered the Korean BBQ dog and my bf got the Jerk dog which was on special along with the buffalo cheese curds. We received our sausages within 10 minutes of ordering and we both thoroughly enjoyed the flavor combinations! As other reviewers have mentioned, the buns were a bit too bready and dense for the unique flavors and could definitely be improved upon. But we overall enjoyed this aspect of our meal.

Now on to the bad news... After looking forward to the cheese curds I had heard so much about, the serving we received about 5 minutes after our sausages was very disappointing. The coating was not at all crispy and far from the wonderful cheese curds other reviewers mentioned and I was expecting. This side was a major reason we wanted to try OSS so it was upsetting to have a negative experience with them. The flavor of the buffalo sauce was nice though.

While the unique combinations available at OSS make me want to return in the future, the unpleasant aspects of my meal were disappointing."}
{"text":"I feel like the Regent St. area is overall very lacking in quality food establishments, so anytime I hear of a new spot there, I never get too excited about it. So, when a friend dragged me to OSS, I was anything but excited to check it out. My expectations were low, especially because i'm an herbivore in what sounded like a carnivore's playground. But OSS managed to well exceed my expectations, and has even become a place I actively try to make it out to! This is because OSS has good and cheap food, and they also have the other aspects of a restaurant down well.

When I went, I was with a large group, and was easily able to find multiple large tables to accommodate us. The staff happily greeted us when we came in, and made it a priority to explain all of the details of their menu. The big selling point for me in particular:  They have VEGAN SAUSAGE! IN MULTIPLE STYLES! So obviously, I got myself the Italian with green peppers and onions. It was delicious, and tasted just like the real thing. My friends had some of the more speciality sausages, and also sang their praises for those. We also tried a couple of sides (the cheese curds, and the hand cut fries), and both of those were very good. The fries in particular are among some of the best i've had in Madison. On top of all this, the restaurant itself is a fun looking spot. It has plenty of large tables, seats that look more like they should be on a bicycle, and a lot of water tubes flowing around the walls. My friends noted that they felt like the place had a \"steampunk\" vibe.

So, a great food menu, with a cool looking space, and some very fun and friendly employees make OSS a destination spot, especially in its prime Regent St location."}
{"text":"The service and staff are passionate about their sausages and cheese curds. We liked the Bahn Mi and the Cheddar Jalapeño over the Doner Kabab. They were all good in their own unique flavors. stringiest cheese curds ever! eat them while it's hot. The sweet mustard was surprisingly addictive that I had to ask where they got it. 

This certainly reminded a bit of the old Hot Doug's place in Chicago....except the OSS space is nicely decorated and the bathrooms were so clean."}
{"text":"They've got SUCH an assortment of flavors. Their motto is \"The world... on a bun!\", and they are true to that statement. From your standard chilli and cheddar cheese to the unexpected harissa and mint yogurt, you'll find flavor blends and combinations from all sorts of cultures & walks of life. 

Their inclusivity knows very few bounds, honestly. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they serve Vegan brats, and gluten-free buns. Personally, i'd go back for the vegan sausage in a heartbeat :D"}
{"text":"I love the casual atmosphere at OSS Madison. It seems like the kind of place I would've spent a lot of time in during grad school with friends playing bridge while sampling their great selection of beers. Plus, their sausages are delicious and creative. 

On a Wednesday night, the place was pretty empty, which gave us more room to spread out the board game. They have a good selection of board games while you wait for your food (i.e. Pandemic, Ticket to Ride, and Carcassonne, etc) plus a few decks of cards for those of us who enjoy a good game of Sheepshead or Spades. 

I ordered their Bahn Mi sausage which reminded me of a bahn mi in that initial bite with all the veggies, but once I got to the sausage, it was a bit weird for me. Not necessarily in a bad way, but I've eaten so many bahn mi sandwiches in my life that the sausage was unexpected and unusual. While the sausage was delicious, the bun was disappointing. It fell apart halfway through my sausage and I was left holding a sausage, veggie, mayo mess. We also ordered fries to share and I was somewhat disappointed that the fries were overdone. They were past crisp and instead were dry and had hard edges. I should've stuck with curds.

Despite the couple of stumbles in the food, 4 stars for the atmosphere, the friendly staff who checked in with us despite the open seating, and the one staff member whose shirt suggested that OSS stands for \"Ohio State Sucks\"."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Definitely the best cheese curds I've ever had. They have such a variety of sausages And they have veggie options!   The atmosphere was awesome. The staff is friendly, the drinks come in mason jars, and food is delicious.I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best cheese curds I've ever tasted. The brats are juicy and delicious, and there are a lot of different varieties on the menu - all of which look amazing. Very friendly and quick service, with a cool atmosphere. The perfect spot for lunch."}
{"text":"A definite \"must\" on the foodie list!! Don't let the nondescript facade fool you!!!The entrance is a between-the-buildings side entry, into an inside urban coolness, or continue on back into a super hip vibe in the Beer Garden (complete with BIKE RACKS and heavily covered vine walls, including vines growing along the overhead patio lights. A weather protected TV and great seating!)!! The interior is well-done including a few unicycle-styled bar stools. The staff is genuinely friendly and accommodating and just plain fun! The beer selection rotates, including having a Mead on tap (Bos Mead...if you haven't tried this yet, you must!!!). A unique and creative \"sausage\" menu, including Vegan options! I had the Vindaloo...aaaaaaaahhhhh-mazing!!! The sandwich is a \"sausage-in-a-bun\" base, but OSS uses a variety of different sausages and their bun selection is perfect...not tough or chewy. My group ordered the Bloody Mary, Egg Roll and Doner Kebab. All were equally fantastic! The fries are good but their curds are fabulous!!!! Not greasy, good sized, and just the right amount of light breading. They have three dipping sauces...we had the Sriracha Mayo and the Sweet & Hot Mustard. Can't wait to share this gem with more friends!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came to OSS Madison for hot dogs. I'd recently made a pilgrimage to Hot Doug's in Chicago before they closed their doors for good, and it was less of  a pilgrimage and more of a rite of passage. OSS has a Hot Doug's vibe to it, and it turns out our cashier/server has been on \"research trips\" to Hot Doug's. 

The service here is excellent. You're greeted and served with a smile, and our server was excited to make us recommendations on toppings for our vegan dog and show us magazines OSS had been featured in. I had a great time-the ambiance is casual, with wood picnic tables and interesting plumbing-themed decorations. 

As for the food, these guys have truly taken a page from Hot Doug's. The vegan dog was crunchy and charred, and paired well with the sport peppers. The doner kebab was by far my favorite of the two hot dogs we ordered. The cucumber yoghurt sauce was layered on thick, but did not overpower the cabbage slaw. The gamey taste of the lamb and chicken sausage was well-complemented by these two sauces/toppings. The cheese curds were another star, with crispy but not overly-fried cheese curds. Break them open, and the cheese curds ooze. The fries were also just as good. These guys know how to fry. 

I highly recommend OSS because its the complete package: service, ambiance, and food. I wish them the best of luck, and hope I can make a return trip soon!"}
{"text":"Unique stuff, cool atmosphere and quick service. Best bacon wrapped beer cheese macaroni covered hot dog ever- hard to go wrong I suppose. Wish I could have tried the deep fried snickers bites!"}
{"text":"Not exactly hitting the mark! Needs improvement.
If you are making something as simple as a hotdog or brat, it better be Damn Good! OSS...not so much.

I'll start with the bun.....It's a bulky chunk of white bread almost resembling being stale. Bland and exactly not what I'm looking for. 
The Chicago dog: So many things wrong with this item to be calling it that. I'm sorry to the people of Chicago (the home a great hotdogs) that this happened to you.
The menu says---- \"Just how Chicagoans like it: tomato, relish, onions, pickle, celery salt, sport peppers, & yellow mustard. Never ketchup!\"
I think the cook got a little lazy on mine and I never received relish & sport peppers. 
When I think Chicago dog, I think Vienna sausage & sport peppers.....What happened here? Blah.... They even used one of their huge white brat buns on this item. Who does that?
The $9.50 Sloppy dog: \"A gigantic plate of food!\" is what the menu says....Fooled me I guess. A simple hotdog on a brat bun again, a bowl of subpar chili, onions, and cheddar cheese. Just call it a regular chili dog and charge people the same as your Chicago dog. Overpriced.
The  Kalberwurst, well maybe the closest thing to tasty I've had. It was a nice veal brat with mushy red cabbage...and that bun....oh yes that bun.

Service: I enjoyed being welcomed in and asked if I had questions, but when I have to argue with you about whether I want to eat in or take my food to go all because the Groupon I purchased apparently in small print says \"eat in\".....That is a big NO!

I understand that you wanted to take up more of my time to explain to me that your food taste so much better if I eat in, but honestly....Why are you arguing with me at all? I am trying to sample your food and become a long time customer because I work around the corner. Put my food in the \"to go\" container sitting right behind you and send me on my merry way!
Atmosphere: Looks great. A handful of nice beer taps, and looks like somewhere \"I would have wanted to go\" have a beer and hotdog after work. Emphasis the WOULD HAVE...."}
{"text":"The hotdogs served changes on the daily. There is no chance that anyone could get tired of the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Always fantastic. Creative dogs. Great flavors. Nicely done. Cheese curds are great too."}
{"text":"I got the guest sausage Morel than a Vealing. It was really yummy. And I can be iffy about hand cut fries but theirs were hot and crispy. The guys who were working were very nice and really helpful. This was our first visit but not our last. Next time, the Wiscago dog."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Badger hockey game day, just a few days after they opened. No new restaurant growing pains here! Plenty of knowledgeable and friendly staff, and some of the coolest ambiance in Madison. Industrial feel with repurposed pipes & gears, and faucets as coat hooks. Loved it.

The owner greeted us upon arrival and gave us the low down on their menu. Traditional sausages like dogs and brats, and some specialty sausages based on foods they love to eat, plus a guest sausage from a local chef. Check out the menu for yourself - so many options! Nice beer selection - served in mason jars which was fun. New Glarus Black Top for him, Hacker-Pschorr wheat for her.

We started with the fried chz curds (only $4!!), which were, in our professional curd eating opinions, some of the best that we had ever eaten. We ended up getting three orders total in our group. Local curds from the owners home town of Monroe, fried to perfection. You can get them with ranch, honey mustard or Siracha mayo. We chose ranch, which was nice and thick and very tasty.

On to the sausages...we both decided to go with the Bahn Mi sausage. Vietnamese pork sausage: pickled veggies, cilantro, jalapeños, chili-mayo. Just the right amount of spice (especially good with beer) and crunch. Per the hubby, the pork sausage melted in his mouth. I'm not a meat eater, but OSS gives the option of subbing in a vegan sausage into any of their specialty sausages with made me quite happy! I immediately recognized the three vegan flavor options (chipotle, Italian, smoked apple & sage) to likely be Field Roast brand sausages. I got the Italian. I've never had an awesome vegan sausage (& I've tried and tried and tried to find one), and Field Roast is about the best I've had, so it was a good choice on their part, but it would be great to see someone out there try to make a decent tasting veggie sausage! In this case, the toppings were so fantastic, and the perfect pairing to any sausage, that I was ecstatic with the whole experience.

We rounded out the meal with their hand cut french fries. Just like the curds, they were fried to perfection. Obviously fresh, peel on, and just great, great, great.

There are so many sausages to try, we will DEFINITELY be going back. It made us nostalgic for Italian sausages at the outdoor beer garden on Badger football game day at Josie's Restaurant that used to sit on this same spot. OSS will absolutely kill it on game day! The waitress kept going outside ( less than 10 degrees out!) with free samples of curds, drawing people in. This place is going to be packed once the word gets out!! The staff told us that we were their first 8 top table - biggest group that they'd had so far...we were so proud. :)"}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of brats but the sausages here are pretty unique and delicious. I tried the doner kebab, which was lamb and chicken with delicious toppings. 

The cheese curds cost $5 for a small amount. It's definitely worth it. I also really don't like cheese curds but I will only eat cheese curds at OSS because they are the bomb!! 

Ambiance is super cool. The tables have keys and small trinkets in them and the restaurant staff is very nice. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love this place...great brats (Banh Mi my fav) make sure to try the curds too!! Great job guys...Cheers guys!! :)"}
{"text":"I would laugh for the people who would rank this place 1 heck even a 2.  I've been here since they've been open and usually I wait go a few times before writing a review.  Here's my time line... I've been here probably 10+ times and every single time has been awesome!!!  Food tastes amazing as always and I love the fun of trying something new because they always have a special every week!  So far everything has been good but my favorite is the Mac Dog and their buffalo cheese curds! Although okay one small thing, you guys use to loud it up with mac n cheese and now it's not as much, not sure if people complained but I thought I should let you know. First time I had the mac dog it was all over the hot dog which was AWESOME! Again love the creativity and the beer! Okay review done! Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Tried Bacon Cheeseburger and Drunky Ducky. Nothing special. Bacon Cheeseburger tasted nothing like Bacon or Cheeseburger. Actually I enjoyed Cheese Curds better than sausages."}
{"text":"We've visited OSS on a number of occasions, usually for lunch, and usually on a weekend when parking isn't such a hassle.   We have only good experiences here.

My wife is stuck on the Bahn Mi sausage.   I think she's had that every visit!   She loves it.

I've had a number of the standard offerings as well as some of the specials,   This afternoon I tried the Remy Lebeau for the first time and it was excellent.

Fries are always consistently exceptional.

We both feel that this will be one of the places we'll really miss when we leave town next year.   So we'll make sure we enjoy it while we're here!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this hidden treasure. 

The employees were stellar and friendly! We ordered the caprese dog, buffalo curds, and a flight. Aside from being a hot dog, I felt so healthy eating the caprese! It was so light and refreshing. And the curds were battered and fluffy and delicious! Make sure you order the sriracha dip - I always need a bit of spice with my curds, though. 

We sat in the back patio/beer garden. The string lights and rustic seating is beautiful for a summer spot. The Bob's burger references are a big plus. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"FINALLY got to try OSS, after they have been on my list for over a year. They had samples of their sausages at the Isthmus Beer and Cheese fest last year, and the Banh Mi sausage was great. 

So when I came into their place on Regent, I decided to try something different. I decided on the Doner Kebab, as I was there for lunch on a work day so didn't want anything too spicy. 

I also noticed they had a special on buffalo cheese curds. I have read many times how good the curds were, but add in a buffalo sauce sprinkled with blue cheese? How could anyone say no to that??? 

The curds were 5 star. Crispy but light breading, high quality cheese, great dipping sauce. It probably took me only 3 minutes to devour all of them, in what I am sure is a portion size made for 2. What can I say, I am an overachiever. 

The sausage was a little disappointing. The chili mayo and cucumber sauce were fantastic, but there was a little too much slaw on there, which made it hard to get to the actual sausage.  The onions were also really overpowering. Once some of it was removed, it was a lot better experience for me. 

The service was great, one of the guys at the counter asked me how I had heard of the place and walked me through the entire menu. He was very attentive and really wanted to know how my experience was. 

This place was really close to getting 5 stars (and probably would have had I just gone for the Banh Mi again!). I will definitely be back, Regent Street has found another gem!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. They have the best cheese curds I've ever had. Being from Monroe, this says a lot because we are notorious for our cheese curds on cheese days. I think this is such a cute little shop with awesome food and great staff! I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped here on a weekend trip from Chicago and we were so impressed with everything about it. From the attentive, helpful service to the delicious, unique sausages and the outdoor seating, it was the perfect place for lunch. Even though I haven't tasted all the cheese curds in Madison, I can definitely see how the cheese curds here might be ranked as such."}
{"text":"How can anyone not like meat stuffed in a tube-like form?  Born and raised in Wisco, not liking sausage is simply not an option.  I have been to OSS a few times and feel they do a solid job with the different variety of sausages they offer.  I think they are inventive and creative (Bahn Mi, Tikka Masala, Doner Kabob) and are priced fairly reasonable.  But what makes any great sandwich is the bread and sadly, OSS doesn't deliver.  The bun is oversized and doesn't have the right consistency (hard outside, soft inside) of a quality sausage bun.  
With the lack of easy and available parking, it will be interesting to see how OSS fares.  The college football crowd will definitely help boost business but will it be enough to keep them afloat?  Only time will tell."}
{"text":"Food: 

I've tried a few of their sausages and have been pleased with the inventive and tasty options they offer. I think the only thing that was disappointing was the poutine. They offer a great selection of curated beers to pair with your food. 

Ambiance: 

The place has a very homemade design scheme (in a good way); imagine your friend who is skilled at carpentry built a restaurant - kind of a steam punk feel too? They have a patio for al fresco dining in the nice months. The service is VERY good - attentive and friendly.

Overall: 
Inventive sausage focused menu with good beer and great service!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars but closer to 4. Came here on a weekend afternoon off hours. The menu is not that extensive but they specialize in what they do. There was an interesting Bratz selection and we tried the cheddar jalepeno Bratz, cheese curds, and loaded fries. The cheese curds are delicious and truly one of the best I've tasted. They use cheddar and have some sort of beer batter on them which makes them gooey, unique, and light. The portion isn't very big but that's alright. The Bratz itself was the most disappointing part. It wasn't bad but was not worth the $7. It was a regular cold bun and the Bratz was just a Bratz to be honest. However, they had interesting concepts. The loaded fries portion was pretty large with interesting flavors. It wasn't the best thing I've had but my SO thought they were really good. Not a bad place to go and they had plenty of board games you can play if desired! Don't come here if you're watching your weight!"}
{"text":"Visit this spot. Management and staff are welcoming and kind. Food is innovative and fun. Family and kid-friendly, super sweet shaded beer garden. Order at the counter and they bring the vittles to your table. Real talk: Latin, Asian, Midwest American Hyper Local themed sandwiches. Food is super thoughtful and VERY good. Price is right. Get the cheese curds, order a wildly eclectic brat/sausage sandwich and post up. Trust me."}
{"text":"What happened?  I haven't been in a long time but we ate at OSS last night.  It was really disappointing.  Our Standards are Slipping?  Overpriced Sandwich Sellers?  The staff was still very friendly and we noticed the really inviting patio out back, but we didn't enjoy any of our food.  We started with curds - I'd call the order we had last night the worst in town.  The batter seems like dough now and it picks up the flavors of everything they've thrown into that fryer (and I don't think they're cleaning said fryer.)  It's obvious they're using fresh curds, which does help immensely.  But...ugh!  She had the polish and I had to try a deep-fried hot dog.  They brought me the wrong item - bacon wrapped.  I wonder if they charged us wrong too.  I just can't make my peace with the concept of only two toppings included on a dog without extra charge.  And it was LOADED with relish...which was right out of the cooler, thus freezing; and it was flavorless too.  Maybe they use a smaller dog when they wrap it in bacon, but there was way too much bun for the size of the meat.  As for the polish - SO tough.  And the onions tasted weird.  We got fries too and they had clearly been sitting around a long time after coming out of the fryer.  I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"We've been to OSS a couple of times now and this unassuming place is amazing! Everything we've tried so far is top notch, so bike over and enjoy it asap."}
{"text":"This is the definition of comfort food. I really liked the layout of the place. They have a bunch of board games for you to try as you wait for your food. Luckily, or unluckily, our food came out just as we were breaking into a quick card game. 

Onto the food. We ordered the cheddar jalapeño brat which was kind of disappointing. I was expecting something a little bigger and tastier but the brat just didn't do it for me. It tasted a little plain and you could barely taste the cheddar. We also ordered their green and gold fries (I think?) which were amazing! They were loaded with cheese, onions, and the works. So unbelievably tasty. Finally, I can't rave enough about the cheese curds. They were so delicious and the cheese they used was not like any other cheese curd I've had. You must eat them as soon as they come out since the cheese is so gooey and delicious. Seriously, you need to come here just to try those."}
{"text":"I love supporting local joints - particularly ones that support local suppliers and OSS does this. 

They have a nice selection of local beers and even cider on tap. I met a friend at OSS who has a thing for on tap cider... Plus I had heard good things about OSS. I started with a cider from Eau Claire. 

I really enjoyed the buffalo hand battered cheese curds. They come with 2 sauces - buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing. I had the smoked polish sausage with caramelized onions and sport peppers. The sporty's had some zing to them. I found the sausage a bid dry and the bun too bid for the sausage. I don't like the bun to overwhelm the sausage. The bun should be sturdy but should be a minor character in the artisan sausage experience. 

This said the sausage had nice flavor. One should more there are a plethora of hand crafted exotic sausages on the menu... From
Classic to Fancy Pantsy. I'll be back to try again... Maybe find a juicier bite."}
{"text":"Fantastic sausage. Cheap beer. Great place.  Menu changes all of the time and they make their own sausage. Also has a customer section where you can bring any recipe and they will try to turn it into a sausage."}
{"text":"Went there for a take-away lunch today, Brat with relish and kraut, and fries.  Really excellent.  I've asked if they have retail sales, and the answer is not yet.  Would love to get a variety to grill at home.  But I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"The dogs are unique and creative. All ingredients work well together. I think the actual dogs themselves could be more substantial and meaty."}
{"text":"its the only place in this backwater village where you can get a hot dog but they charge over 3 bucks for it..... ridiculous"}
{"text":"Delicious, interesting brats/hotdogs. Good beer. Nice style. I head here every so often for lunch and have really enjoyed the variety of different signature brats, from the Meditteranean kebob-style to the Thai, to the Chicago style. All totally unique and mouth-watering. Curds are great-- especially the green and gold special! And good beer selection as well. Outdoor patio in the summer is boss, and if you like board games, theyve got a ton!"}
{"text":"Stopped for  a quick late lunch. Great fries & curds  Comfortable flavor on Chgo dogs. Friend service as usual."}
{"text":"This place is great for hanging out. Whole stack of games to play and good, reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"The fries are awesome, no doubt there. Been there twice and had the Korean BBQ brat once and the Phuket (Thai) brat the second time. 

The Korean BBQ brat was overwhelmed by the Kimchi and you couldn't really taste much beyond that. 

The Phuket though? Amazing. Coconut milk on a brat is astoundingly good. 

Restaurant also gets style points for the (evolving?) steampunky theme and the clever use of OSS throughout. Example: soda lids are \"Our Spill Stoppers\"

Great, laid back place for a long weekday lunch - with good beers on tap, to boot. You may not make it back to work afterwards ;-)"}
{"text":"Looking to break up the monotony of 39 S. between Minneapolis and Chicago, so we detoured here. Well worth the time and effort. Great food, great beer and a staff who were really enthused about the product. Will be back."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great consistently, but the customer service is impeccable. They rescued my card from the floor the other day and gave me a glass of water before I headed on my way again, saying they would always take care of me. And I believe it."}
{"text":"I was in Madison and wanted to see what really good cheese curds taste like, and I had read that this place has 'em.  But even more thrilling was that OSS is also a wonderfully creative cafe with excellent fare all the way around, great atmosphere, and a friendly staff.

The cheese curds were indeed excellent: they were of the cheddar variety, and they were fresh, lightly fried, and not too salty.  But this place specializes in sausages, and the have very creative and unique sausage combinations.  I had the Banh Mi and The Dining Room.  They both tasted great, and were prepared with care, although I will say that the Dining Room sausage was a bit dry and consequently had a mealy texture.  Another problem was the arrangement of the overall sandwich on the bun:  The bun was a bit too small, so the heap of cilantro and other things on top were impossible to keep in place, and I don't think I ever got a single bite with both the sausage and its toppings.  The Banh Mi did not suffer from the moisture issue, but the arrangement was still too awkward to enjoy without most of the ingredients spilling out of the bun.

The decor attempts to emphasize the hacker or *maker* theme with lots of copper pipes, valves, tubes of bubbling liquids, cogs, etc., that give it a sort of upscale garage laboratory feel.  Herbie Hancock and Charles Mingus, two great innovators in their own rights, were both played while I was eating, so... Obviously hitting all my soft spots.

The staff was very friendly, and there was a great selection of beers on tap to boot.  Definitely recommend!  I hope they can solve their logistics issues with the composition of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Just woke up from an OSS induced food coma that lasted 2 days. Worth it? I think so!

I love restaurants that take one classic item and put fun, creative spins on it. I call it novelty food. Hot dogs are already full of fun so OSS' crazy versions are just about as fun as it gets. Keep in mind that there's not much else on the menu, although you'll find a good selection of beer, cheese curds and fries. 

I got the deep fried bacon wrapped hot dog and my roommate got the banh mi hot dog. We split the poutine. I hate to say this but I think my hot dog was a little too decadent even for me; I couldn't finish it but the first few bites were awesome. Poutine had good gravy and a very generous amount of curds but the fries were a little too crispy for my liking. Will have to try to banh mi next time because I heard it's great! 

Recommend OSS if you want something different and fun! Just make sure you have time for a food coma!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my wife. 

Overall good experience! A little pricey, but it was high quality stuff. 

Really cool beer garden out back. Would be cool atmosphere at night. 

I had the duck sausage with spicy brown mustard, cranberry sauce and caramelized onions. Fries were very scrumptious.... curds were very good... top 5 in Madison. 

I would try it out again."}
{"text":"OSS blew my mind! I have been past this place many times over the past year and never bothered to look at the menu because I'm vegetarian. Today I gave it a chance and was astounded by their vegan sausage. They have three different types of vegan sausage that you can swap out for any of their hotdog specials or build your own creation. I had a great talk with the general manager, Josh, and discussed the great beer list and top shelf liquor options they have. Great rum, great beer, great service, great food."}
{"text":"I have been back several times. They continue to improve on what they do best, tasty and unique sausages, an awesome selection of board games and a wonderful indoor and outdoor atmosphere. The staff is very friendly, even offering board game suggestions. They are also very dog friendly and told us to ask if they have a burnt sausage to give him next time we are there. This place continues to impress!"}
{"text":"I did not know this hidden gem exists until today! They offer the perfect trinity for a comforting brunch/lunch - cheese curds, poutines, and hot dogs. Better yet, they have varieties for each type, and seems is always experimenting on new flavor combination (in their terms, Open Source)

Cheese curds: do not expect they are crispy despite the golden appearance. They are soft and the cheese is really gooey, but not too sharp. I ordered the tikka masala curds, which taste amazing! I am happy to see someone is brave to take a fun spin on this sconnie staple!

Poutines: The gravy could be richer and a bit saltier. The tomato overpowers the entire dish, even the potatoes... Regardless, they are really comforting and made a great appetizer to share with the group. 

Hot Dogs: They have various of hot dogs combined with many ingredients and condiments. I got their weekly special SoCal Breakfast (Field Roast Grain Meats Chipotle Vegan Sausage topped with Fried Egg, French Fries, Spicy Mango Pico de Gallo, & Avocado Crema). The vegan sausage is amazing, and I did not realize it is vegan until I am checking their online menu 5 minutes ago. I like how they keep the flavor for the other ingredients mild enough that the sausage is still the highlight of the dish. The avocado crema is very fresh, and the runny yolk from the fried egg makes everything better!

Their dish overall have milder flavor than what people would expect. While in some cases it steals away the eating experience, it also shows they are thoughtful in making their dishes for a larger group of customers. And hey, there is always salt, sriracha, and other condiments on the table if we need to tweak the flavor!

The environment is also very relaxing with wooden interiors, a bar, and best of all....stacks of board games! 

I look forward to their other open source ideas."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious place! I got their frito chili dog and it was basically exactly what I expected - basically a giant mess of a frito pie on a sausage. I feel like this is the epitome of American comfort food...tasty food in a trivia-bar-like setting. 

In general, most of their sausages are fairly cheap and will still fill you up! There's quite a variety of items to get too, so I think there should be something for everyone.

If you're a fan of hot dogs in various flavors, shapes, and sizes, I would definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great favorable sausages. Wide range from basic to foodie choices to satisfy your palette. The fried cheese curds were awesome with the blue cheese dip. My husband really enjoyed his onion soup. Must admit it was good. The staff and owner here just makes you feel like you walked into their home with great food  welcoming conversation. It was one the highlights of our short trip."}
{"text":"The food here is not 'chicago style' whatsoever. I'm not sure if they ever market it as 'chicago style' but they really shouldn't, it's a pure DISGRACE! 

For example, the meat is rubbery, the chili taste like beer sauce, and all the fries are simply gooey and chewy. Both times I've come for dinner I've had to wait twenty plus minutes for a small 'dish'. So, yeah, the food is really low quality but how about the people who run it? TWO of my friends have been contacted by facebook BY the owner/manager seeking SEXUAL -RELATIONS. Now I would like to add that both of my friends are girls, and we all now think the people who run it our class A P.I.G.S. So gross, don't even want to imagine what they do to the food. It's gross to think they're such losers they can't even ask for a name, they use the RECEIPT of transaction to look them up after-hours...EWWWWWWWWWWWWW"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop in for a sandwich and some curds! Great food and pretty quick service. One drawback is the parking situation. This is a problem downtown and I won't give them less stars because of this. Gluten free? No problem here!"}
{"text":"BRILLIANT! Ian's for sausages... and done well. (That's lingo for Ian's Pizza for those of you non-Madisonians.) 

Strolled here with some co-workers last week and got to try the Doner Kabob (which tasted almost like a gyro), Curry & Fundido. Doner Kabob was the best but I wouldn't recommend skipping those curds or fries... they are worth. the. calories!

Can't wait to hit up OSS again!"}
{"text":"If you are adverse to hipsters, and foodies this may not be your place. The variety of different types of sausage was fantastic, and the presentation was very cool! I will definitely be revisiting next time I'm in Madison, a little out of your ordinary decor with very good food!"}
{"text":"It was the best of times, it was the wurst of times...

(I give myself a one star rating for starting off this review with that phrase...)

The lure of a free order of cheese curds on Belly provided me with the perfect excuse to give OSS Sausage another shot.   Though the sub-standard bun underwhelmed me during my first visit, rumors of an upgrade (h/t to Yelper extraordinaire Ashley H) reinforced my desire to return to this hipsteresque Regent Street eatery.

The lack of lunchtime patrons on a Tuesday afternoon surprised me when I stepped into the restaurant.  I figured that the parade of tempting photos that appear the OSS social media platforms would draw a perpetual flood of customers.  

As the ultimate caramelized onion fanboy, I quickly zeroed in on the Remy LeBeau, (Zuber's Andouille sausage, caramelized onions, sautéed bell peppers, Wundomus creole seasoning, and cajun remoulade) and my free side of cheese curds.

A staff member delivered my cheese curds soon after I paid for my order.  The lightly curds are incredibly light and fluffy, it's almost like they could float away if I took too long to devour them.  While I prefer my cheese curds with a little more exterior crunch, OSS turns out a stellar rendition of this Wisco delicacy.  The mild-tasting curds from Maple Leaf Cheese in Monroe benefited from the punch of flavor provided by the spicy sriracha mayo sauce.  Other sauce options include a pedestrian ranch and a sweet and hot mustard.

After I polished off my curds, the person who took my order delivered my sandwich.  To my shock and disappointment, the cook practically incinerated my andouille sausage to the point that all I could taste was the exterior char.  The dry, chewy sausage completely overshadowed the fact that OSS did indeed upgrade their bun.  After a couple of bites, I was ready to write off this restaurant.

Then one of the owners dropped by my table and asked what I thought of my meal.  After sharing my disappointment, he immediately offered to prepare another sandwich for me.  

The second rendition of my sandwich was pure bliss.  The plump, juicy sausage was an ode to porcine goodness, brimming with flavor in every bite.  They also amped up the topping quantity.  While the caramelized onions were more sautéed than caramelized, their slight sweetness helped balance out the heat of the sausage and the sauce.  By the time I finished my sandwich, I was already dreaming about a return visit.

Despite the poor execution of my initial sandwich, I am bumping up my rating of OSS to four stars.  While I have concerns about their ability to consistently execute their well-composed menu, the wow factor I experienced with my second sandwich and the fact that management truly cares about the customer experience pushes this steampunk-themed shop into four star territory."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to OSS and I have to say I'm pretty impressed.  I tried the vegan sausage.  They offer 3 types of Field Roast; italian, chipotle or sage.  The one I tried was the italian and it was delish!  Their fries are really good too!  Next time I will be trying the cheese curds.  

OSS uses the Belly Card rewards program.  So I will be back and getting a freebie before long.  Any downsides?  Parking.  There isn't any.  I parked at Meriter and walked over.  Em, yeah, not good, but I wasn't going to waste gas driving in circles looking for a place to park and walk for blocks in the cold."}
{"text":"Love their creative and fresh menu. I might have to say that this is one of my favorite local restaurants for an authentic Madison/Wisconsin experience. Gourmet Brats, for the win!

Bonus points for their super friendly staff, their beautiful (and dog friendly!) back patio, and the great beer selection."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a sausage person, but I really really liked OSS. 

OSS takes the simple hot dog/brat and makes it so much more. The creativity in their menu items is a bit overwhelming at first, because (at least in my case) you'll want to order everything. We tried the Korean BBQ and Doner Kebab signature sausages. The Korean BBQ one is a pork sausage topped with kimchi, tons of cilantro, and caramelized onions all nestled into a hot dog bun. I had jalapenos added as well. It was very tasty and unique. The Doner Kebab was also excellent. It had a lamb and chicken sausage with a Turkish-inspired cole slaw and tzatziki, among other toppings that I can't remember. My one complaint about the sausages is the buns they use, but that might just be a matter of preference.

We also ordered cheese curds and fries. The cheese curds here might be my favorite of anywhere in Madison. They are very lightly battered and fried, yielding a super light and delicious fried curd that feels way less terrible for you than it is. Waayy better than the grease-gobs you might find elsewhere. The fries were crispy and yummy, just the way we like them. The portions are a good size for the price ($2 for a ton of fries!), and OSS offers a great selection of beers on tap as well."}
{"text":"In terms of sausages you will find nothing better in Madison, insofar as I've experienced anyhow, as OSS. 

They have a wide variety of uniquely flavored sausage / garnish combos that are just amazing -- each in their own way and most evoking some particular national flavor. 

This makes it a great stop for a group of people who just can't decided if they want Mexican, Indian, etc... as everyone can scratch their flavor itch of choice. Having tried much of their regular menu I can say that I have not once been disappointed by any selection (though I do have my favorites -- their \"doner kebab\", a lamb and chicken sausage with a house-made cucumber yogurt sauce is just AMAZING)

They are affordably priced, their sides are simple but also amazing, and if you are dining in they have spacious tables and even have board games onhand if you want to take your time with it. 

While I'm not much of a drinker, these days, they also have a bar there, as well -- so they've got that going for 'em!"}
{"text":"I know this is going to be an unpopular review, but I have to say that everything at OSS is 5 stars...except the food.  \"Underwhelming\" and \"over-rated\" were just 2 of the terms muttered during my 3rd visit to OSS.  The ideas are great, but not executed well.  I got the Picnic Dog, which was topped with bbq sauce, pickle slice, coleslaw, salt and vinegar chips.  I tasted bbq sauce.  Nothing else.  Where was the vinegar, where was the coleslaw, where was the beef?!  Since OSS uses regular beef dogs, I couldn't even taste the hot dog, which makes me wonder why they are not using jumbo dogs under all those toppings?   My BF got the chili dog, and again, we had to search for the hot dog.  He requested it without onions, and we could see some onion on the chili where they put it on and then picked it off.  Cheese curds are good, but unseasoned.  For a $30 meal (without drinks), we were really dissatisfied.  

The service is amazing, the staff is helpful and nice, and I love the large tables and option to play one of the many board games available.  But I will not be back to OSS."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Tuesday evening around 6pm. Perfect timing. We arrived to be only greeted by the nicest guy. He explained everything that we had questions about. They offer beer flights as well. I really like their neat beer flight wooden holder. Very cool. 

We both ordered the special. The Gouda Mac and Cheese dog. Bacon wrapped dog with Gouda Mac and cheese and tomatoes. It was very tasty. I'm actually more excited to order more off their menu. Can't wait to go back honestly. 

We did order cheese curds too and they were perfect...the right size and very tasty. Got the Sriracha mayo with them. Perfect combo. Cheese curds are from Monroe, WI. 

The guy that took our order was very nice and even took the time to come to our table and tell us about the restaurant and future plans to have more Mac and cheese dogs. Different variations. They have some very clever ideas and great match ups planned.

Put them on your Facebook page because they have great pictures of their specials. I could eat here everyday. 

The interior is very eclectic and unique. They offer board games to play at your leisure. Just fantastic. Music selection was really good. Very impressed."}
{"text":"I'm a big time sausage addict. This is one of my favorite stops in town. The people working are very friendly and welcoming! And most importantly the food is excellent. The sausages are local and prepared excellently. There's tons of interesting ideas for toppings, and the open source menu allows for a constant stream of new things to try. The fries are great, and you can tell that they cut the potatoes and fried them fresh. The cheese curds are the same way and arguably the best in town. Even the soup is often excellent! I've eaten so many different things there, so it's hard to recommend individual items. If you like chili dogs, the Sloppy Dog is a feast with great chili. The smoked brat is always excellent, as is the Italian. Even the vegetarian sausages are super tasty!"}
{"text":"We stopped in after a game at the kohl center.  The menu selection was fantastic and had a lot of unique choices.  The manager was very helpful and accommodating.  The food was  excellent and we can't wait to head back and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Went back today for lunch and had another really solid meal! The Korean BBQ sausage was god but I thought the caramelized onions overwhelmed the kim chee a bit. Would have liked to have just a bit more of that funky/delicious fermented cabbage kick! Also thoroughly enjoyed the poutine quite a bit, but I thought the potatoes could have been fried just a bit longer. Very close to perfect, OSS, VERY close!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times have been awesome experiences. All of the staff that I've encountered have been super personable and friendly and the food is creative and delicious. They also have a great atmosphere inside as well as a nice little courtyard in the back that is perfect for a beautiful spring/summer day."}
{"text":"I feel a bit bad it has taken me this long to write this review. My husband and I stopped in a few months ago for dinner. You order when you first walk in at the counter and they bring your order to your table, your sort of typical fast casual set up but the ambience is definitely more a laid back but trendy pub/tavern. I loved the cool mechanical water art pieces on the walls (hard to describe, wish I had a pic!); just in general a really good vibe. I ordered a duck sausage and my husband had something with a Thai influence if I remember correctly, along with a side order of fries. They offer all sorts of really interesting sausages along side some more familiar flavors (it's Wisconsin, gotta have a traditional bratwurst right?). My husband's order came out and a few minutes later mine hadn't arrived, no big deal as I was enjoying the delicious fries, when someone came over to apologize that they had accidentally burnt mine and were working on another one. He was super nice and apologetic and a few minutes later my order arrived. No harm, no foul. And it was definitely worth the ever so slightly longer wait! Everything was delicious!!!! We were checked on a couple more times, with another apology for the slight mistake. The folks working there could not have been nicer or more attentive. The food was great, but seriously, the service really made the night. And to top it off, they gave us a free order of deep fried mini Snickers! Yes, they are as decadent as they sound. I can't recommend this place enough! I hope to be back soon. And a big kudos to the exemplary staff for making it a wonderful experience! Oh, and if the weather allows, check out the cool little patio around back!"}
{"text":"Happy with first OSS experience--overall a very good brat&curd experience.

The cheese curds (tempura fried?) really are excellent.  Fried cheese curds generally fill me with a sense of cheesy happiness and regret (\"What did I just ingest?!?\") but batter is so light and fresh you are able to somewhat forget it's fried cheese ;)

The Cheddar Jalapeño brat \"Cheddar and Jalapeño-stuffed pork sausage topped with fire roasted jalapeños, shredded cheddar cheese, and a sweet corn-infused sour cream\" I appreciated that the cheese was grated in house but the sour cream didn't add much . I scraped off most of the cream, and I only realized it had sweet corn flavor after reading the description.  


Staff is very prompt and friendly, including delivering your food to you at your table and clearing your plate.  Overall the restaurant was well maintained and clean, which is no easy feat considering that the dining room filled with pre-game Badger fans.  FYI non-pork eaters, the majority of sausages have pork with the exception of 100% beef and vegan. I was also able to get a deal by using the Hooked app on my phone.

Good addition to Regent Street!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place is in our neighborhood! The sausages are SOO yummy, great beer on tap, awesome beer garden (dog friendly, too!) in back, lots of fun games and super friendly staff. The Bahn Mi sausage is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent change and unique style brat and hotdog establishment.  Creative staff that has put together delicious and interesting brats.  They have variety of different signature brats, from the Meditteranean kebob-style to the Thai, to the Chicago style and more.  Good beer selection as well.  

I had the kebob-style brat and son had the chili-dog.  Kebob tasted exactly like a kebob that I had in Turkey.   My son loved the chili-dog...it was completely smothered.  Defiantly a place when looking for something different."}
{"text":"Do you even sausage bruh? OSS does.

This spot's a bit off the beaten path and away from where all the action seemed to be happening... not sure if it was because school wasn't in session, but relatively quite and empty for Saturday around dinner time. 

Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised by several things here...
1. Creative sausages ~ I personally did the bahn mi inspired sausage which was great! Vietnamese style pork in a sausage served with the usual bahn mi fare of pickled veggies, cilantro, jalepenos, and a unique chili-mayo. Yums. Also had a bite of their Korean BBQ sausage which was equally delicious.
2. Beer on tap ~ limited selection but they had spotted cow and only $5 a pint. Sick...
3. $1 Henderson Gin shots... wth. I think I recall a limit on these bargain shots. But damn. Only a buck.
4. Service ~ excellent. I think it might have been the owner or manager who had walked us through the menu being it was our first time here. Either way he was super patient and went through everything they had to offer from the more traditional brats/hot dogs to their specialty offerings and even some other sausage specials they had. Once handing us a number, he made it clear to leave any baskets at the tables as they bus them and even a nice thanks from everyone that was working in the back once we headed out. Peeps in Wisconsin are super friendly!

All in all a great casual spot to grab some wieners and beers. I'm guessing this place is lit when school is in session. That's all I got on this one. 

'Til next time, cheers!

{"text":"Dude! This place is really fun. Their menu rotates frequently, it's creative, it's flavorful...and the curds!
THE CURDS!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great casual place for hanging out! Their dogs & brews are terrific and the creative steam punk decor is fantastic too. The only reason I'm taking off  1/2 a star to a star is because I think it's a little over priced. Not so much so that it keeps me from going about once a week though."}
{"text":"I just made an account to review OSS. This is hands down the best brat shop in the city. When my party walked in, the super friendly cashier walked around counter to explain the menu from our perspective. The brat and dog we ordered came out in under five minutes, and each tasted tremendous. OSS is clearly run by people who love what they do and are hellbent on delivering quality products and first class service."}
{"text":"After trying O.S.S. a couple months ago with a groupon it has quickly become a go to for my boyfriend and me. We've been in on both weekends and weeknights and the service has been fast and tables were available. O.S.S. has some of the most genuinely friendly staff members that I have ever encountered in a restaurant! I've already brought in friends to experience the clean, modern setting + weird and impressive food. Can't wait to enjoy the outdoor seating this spring and summer. 

Our personal favorites are the bacon wrapped hotdog, the bahn mi, and the various french fry special platters. So good! I also really like that they always seem to have cider boys on tap since it's one of my favorite ciders. They offer food to go but I would recommend dining in since the atmosphere is nice and no risk of a soggy bun."}
{"text":"Super friendly, funny staff? Check! Cute and unique decor? Check! Super casual spot for a quick lunch? Check! VEGAN SAUSAGES??!!  CHECK!!! I'm in!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great addition to the Regent Street area!  We tried three sausages: regular deep fried, Chicago and Bahn Mi.  All we great, moist, good snap to the casing and a little mess but that should be expected.  As a side we had cheese curds, light airy batter with squeaky cheddar inside!  Tap list was also fabulous, way better than average!  They had New Glarus Black Top on tap!!!!!!!! 

I love the esthetics!  Comfortable for collage students, but warm enough for families or game day goers! 

Service was stellar....5 stars!  Spoke with the owners and management staff, personable and excited about their product!  All staff were on top of there game and educated about menu.  

We learned all sausages are sourced locally in Green County where they work collaboratively with the sausage make to develop personalized meats!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just tried this place for lunch the other day and it was pretty good. I got the Mac Dog, he got a deep-fried, bacon-wrapped hotdog, and we shared a side of deep-fried cheese curds.

The cheese curds were incredible when they first came out; they were so gooey and delicious! After our dogs came out, we left the curds for a bit and after they cooled off they weren't as gooey so you have to eat them right away!

We both liked our hotdogs but the mac and cheese on top of mine tasted a little off. You wouldn't think you could go wrong with mac and cheese, but the taste was somehow tainted so I ended up scraping most of it off. The actual meat was great though, so I guess I just chose the wrong topping. 

The overall vibe and interior was nice and modern and I would definitely go back again to give them a second chance with another dog! (And definitely get some more curds!)"}
{"text":"Great fun and really really clean place. Customer service is like 10 stars. Had a cheeseburger and a mushroom and Swiss from them with fries and deep fried snickers for dessert. Absolutely the best taste profile I have ever had with sausages. Absolutely a must go to when in town."}
{"text":"To put it simply, THE BEST RESTAURANT IN THE U.S.!!!!! Food is amazing. Customer service is superb. If you've never visited Madison or even Wisconsin, this restaurant is the only reason you need for the trip. If I lived here, I'd eat here every day for every meal. Unfortunately I live a state over so I guess I'll be driving a lot on the weekends."}
{"text":"The cheese curds were the bomb! Very fast and friendly service. Many hotdog and brat options with unique specials."}
{"text":"OSS had my favorite cheese curds in Madison with its unique and crunchy batter. Also, their banh mi dog was ON POINT. As a Vietnamese woman who is quick to judge any trendy Americanized variation of Vietnamese sandwiches, my friend who introduced me to OSS looked at me knowingly and said \"No, I know what you're thinking. But it's good--trust me!\" Lo and behold, I took the plunge and ordered something I would have never ordered on my own. Needless to say, I was impressed by how well the ingredients worked together. Light and refreshing pickled carrots and daikon beautifully complemented the meaty, juicy richness of their brat...

Now I am DEVASTATED that OSS is gone. I was just here the week before the closed, and I had no idea. Now I know exactly how Katy Perry felt when she sang about \"The One That Got Away.\" :'(

(PS. PLEASE COME BACK!)"}
{"text":"They only do hotdogs but they do them well! Small little space with a variety of options.  I wish I would've gone here more often when I lived near it.  Prices are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I'd like to suggest a motto change to \"The world...on a cold untoasted bun!\" Seriously - the sandwiches are inventive and delicious, but serving the creations on a cold bun is such a poor choice. And despite their functional kitchen equipment, the laws of physics seem to be suspended where toasting is concerned because they won't do it even when you ask. 
I've stopped going there for this reason. I'm not sure why they can't make this one last effort when they put so much into the products they make."}
{"text":"This place is seriously off the hook! They have classic as well as inventive, delicious sausages and not just something, but many things, for everyone! Even for people (like me) who shy away from white flour and pig parts, OSS has got you covered! 

I ordered the bison & blue sausage, which is basically everything good inside of a bun: buffalo, blue cheese, walnuts, pears, tarragon, and almonds. At $10 (I went for a gluten-free bun; otherwise $9) it's a very affordable most-expensive-thing-on-the-menu. Our party also got the phuket (Thai-inspired) and doner party (tasted like a gyro) sausages, both of which received thumbs up. Mad props to the cheese curds with the sriracha mayo, too!

As good as their sausages are, their beer is even better. Good selection of mostly local darks & lights in cute jars of varying sizes (the 24 oz tall jar is pretty awesome!) We got the O'So Sweet Lady Milk Stout on Nitro, which was deliciously sharp and creamy, and we went for the 24 oz of the Saint Francis Beam Me Up, Scotchy!, which was basically a very strong cross between cold brew coffee and scotch ale. 

The decor is sly and clever. It's steampunk inspired, without being in your face. So if you are into that, you will appreciate it. It you aren't, it won't be obnoxious. The employees were very friendly and helpful. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and we were greeted by I believe the owner. He was a wealth of knowledge, answered all our questions and made some great suggestions. We had the buffalo curds to start - they did not disappoint. Piping hot curds served with homemade buffalo sauce and some bleu cheese crumbles. They did not skimp on the amount either. I had the Banh Mi, Vietnamese Pork Sausage topped with pickled veggies, cilantro, fresh jalapeños, & chili-mayo and my friend had the Doner Kebabm A Turkish Lamb & Chicken sausage topped with fresh cabbage slaw, diced tomatoes & onions, chili-mayo, & house-made cucumber yoghurt sauce. They were both indescribably delicious! We both ooo'd and ahhh'd over them until they were gone. Everything is extremely flavorful. The gentleman that waited on us then came over and sat with us and asked how everything was, made sure we were doing OK. I cannot say enough good about this place and will for sure be back soon. They have a nice outdoor area for nice weather in the back. Can't wait to enjoy that in the summer. Oh, lastly we had some deep fried snicker bars dusted with powdered sugar...just as good as everything else."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, owner is personable and knowledgeable, the menu is more interesting than a blockbuster movie. Once you eat here it will soon become a staple in your life"}
{"text":"Occassion: Dinner with friends, touring Madison
Food: banh mi dog, cheese curds, loaded fries, some other dog that I forgot
Thoughts: Awesome cheese curds. The batter is different from the other cheese curds I tried in the area, and I prefer it over the others. There is a unique selection of dogs - the two I had tasted great. Loaded fries were ok, not enough toppings on it and the fries were kind of dry, but the cheese curds were great that I can overlook this. Great environment - lots of board and card games that you can play while waiting, eating, or drinking."}
{"text":"Food is really flavorful! The service is a little slow, but most of the time it is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on OSS by accident, decided to give it a go.  Bahn Mi sausage, Doner kebab sausage, poutine and fried snickers dessert.  Best meal we've had in months, and we dine out pretty frequently.  Ambiance is really unique and satisfying.  You can tell, there is a lot of love and thought in what OSS puts out on your table.  Both sausages rocked.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  Have lived in Madison for 10 years.  This in in my top 3 restaurants.  Nice job guys.  We'll be back"}
