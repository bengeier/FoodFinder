{"text":"Alright, so I have been to John Anthony's a few times now. It's very close to my home, so it's awesome if we don't feel like cooking. I will say that I have had the meatball sub, the Reuben, and the fish sandwich. All three were outstanding! My wife usually gets the Turkey Reuben, which is dynamite as well. BUUUUTTTT, the last time we went she decided to try the grilled chicken salad. She literally said it was one of the worst items she ever got at a restaurant. The chicken was tasteless, the fries were average, the veggies were scarce, the lettuce was wilted and appeared to be straight from a \"garden mix bag\" you would get from the store. There was no cheese, and the homemade raspberry vinaigrette was bland. All that for $12! Ouch! Stay away from that one! I have to say I'm working on a hometown love for this place, but that grilled chicken salad was definitely a blow to my frequent diner status since it is one of my wife's \"go to\" dishes. Step it up J.A's!"}
{"text":"I made it to John Anthony's a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised in what I found.    The atmosphere was great for watching a Pens or Steelers game (and the plentiful supply of alcohol to drown your Pirates related sorrows while watching AJ Burnett serve up 5 earned runs before the 2nd inning).  The food was above average as far as bar/restaurants go.  I recommend the fish sandwich, the mozzarella sticks and of course the carrot cake cheesecake.  Seriously, that carrot cake cheesecake is that good.  Honestly its worth the trip for that menu item alone."}
{"text":"Good service & good variety of food for local bar food. Prices are vary reasonable. Great breaded zucchini"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here or a bad experience. You can tell the food is mad fresh and the staff is always good. I have even been there when there place was packed and no where to sit but still the great service."}
{"text":"After sitting at our table for 12-15 minutes waiting to be waited on went up to the hostess & asked, who is suppose to wait on our table. Apparently they were unsure who's section it was. It was not crowded. Finally ordered drinks & our dinner. Wedding soup cold: wrong salad dressing: the herb chicken sandwich, so so. Salmon dinner, salmon was pretty small & not much flavor. Chicken parm hoagie, nothing but bread. Veal parm was the only good meal from our table. The waiter, he was nice & polite."}
{"text":"Just down the road from my house. John Anthony's is a great place to bring my family. My husband enjoys the sports on the big screen and my son loves sitting in the high tables in the lounge. It's a great place to stop after work for a glass of vino and their daily specials never seem to disappoint. My recent selection had hand made her bed pasta and the chicken was juicy .The wedding soup is always on point . I have been here several times since we moved to the area and I plan on keeping it in rotation."}
{"text":"We had our FFL year end party there this weekend. We sat in the front part of the bar area two tables about 15 guys total. Large TV's to watch multiple games.   Fast, friendly service for this large group.   Good fish sandwich and onion rings. Onion soup was not very good nor the fried mushrooms. Wings were average at best. Buuutttt! The Carrot Cake Cheese Cake was terrific! A very nice surprise!  The Pizza also looked very good although I had no room left to try any, most people seemed to enjoy it. The $2 Labbott draft special during Pens games are a nice deal too.  We will probably return because the staff treated our group so well!"}
{"text":"So I've been coming here since they opened because I live in the Acers, and I swear the food keeps getting better!  Seriously, the drinks are definitely much better and the staff is unbelievable, honestly give it a try."}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly service, GREAT wings and great food selection!  Been there a few times so far and have not ever been disappointed."}
{"text":"The hubs and I went here for our HOA block party. It was out the wazoo packed on a week day night. Holy moly, I had to stand up the whole time. I think there were at least 5 other parties or events going on simultaneously and our HOA definitely did not book enough seats or something. Yes, there was a parking lot but it was viciously narrow and did not even accommodate a fraction of people in there. The setup is super weird and awkward. It reminded me of Pugliano's where there are 3 or 4 separate rooms/areas that don't really associate with each other so you just have to know where you're supposed to go.   Food here was kind of blah. The pizza was really thin, greasy and sparse in toppings. The wings were dry, small and sauce was on the side. Granted, this is their catering selection but it was probably a 2-star for me for just the food.  Service was surprisingly fast and attentive for all the people being there. Even while I never had a seat, the waitresses always spotted me and got me my 2 soft drinks very promptly. So I guess John Anthony's has this going for it.   The location is out of the way and weird and I have no clue why anyone would choose to purposely dine here. The quality of food is pretty bad and the selection is very limited. I would not recommend this place."}
