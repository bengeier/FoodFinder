{"text":"Chinese food so bad it makes you want to cry...or at least send it back!  Have been ordering party trays of deep fried wings from here for years. Loved it!! Price on those recently shot WAY up so we decided to order just an appetizer wings and then an assortment of other dishes (chicken balls, shanghai noodles, beef fried rice, general tao's chicken, assorted veg). It was all terrible. Beyond terrible. The wings are clearly all they can make well. And to top it all off, after asking for extra lemon they sent...wait for it...NO lemon for the wings at all. And now my stomach is starting to cramp up...not exactly a well-spent $54."}
{"text":"This place is the best standard Canadian version of Chinese food you can get. They're always friendly, take special orders when they can, deliver fast (always within 45 minutes and i live on the brim of their delivery area), and the prices are great!   My food has always been hot and fresh, not to mention delicious.  I spend $20-25 dollars for delivery and have meals for three days, the serving sizes are  great."}
{"text":"The food is ok- not great - but conveniently located to pick up from forest hill.  When you call and they say 15 minutes, you get there in 20 but then to wait another 20 is unacceptable.  Food is not worth waiting that long!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the prices is very reasonable.  I had ordered the Singapore noodles and it's made the way I like it.  I had also ordered the hot & sour soup and was a little disappointed when I couldn't find any BBQ pork in the soup at all. Now I know not to order that again next time.  I had to get it delivered as I was not able to leave and since I was only 2 blocks away from the place I figure it will be quick.    The food got delivered pretty quick was happy about that and when I paid the driver I gave him the exact amount of the bill and he was looking at it and start saying \"No tip?\" \"No tip?!\".  I didn't realize that tip was mandatory, I thought since it was less than a 2 minute drive, I didn't have to pay extra since I had to order their minimum of $20 for free delivery.  This totally turned me off.  I normally tip when I know I'm farther away from the restaurant to help cover the cost of gas, but seriously 2 blocks?  Come on.   I have never had a driver ask for tip, this is the first time and personally I think it's rude and distasteful!  This is the main reason why I bumped my rating from  4 stars to 3."}
{"text":"We tried to order food since this was close by. They never showed up and stopped answering their phone. We are sad :("}
{"text":"This is stereotypical Canadian style Chinese food. I ordered takeout after noticing this restaurant in my neighborhood.   They claim to have been around for over 20 years (and I don't think a thing has changed in those years.  Not the sign, nor the inside.  The food was good, and I ordered too much.  You get the option of free rice or chicken wings if you spend over 30$ or 35$ respectively.  I made sure to order over $35, and thoroughly enjoyed my free chicken wings that night, and the next afternoon!  The food is good, and so are the portion sizes; The shrimp spring rolls were good. The house fried rice was ok.  It had a slight burnt taste to it, as some places unfortunately do. The beef and broccoli was really good as were the chicken wings. The General Tao chicken was ok.  It could have used a bit more spice. The deep fried wontons were quite good, but plain. The chicken balls and the battered shrimp were good and typical.  I was disappointed in the sweet and sour sauce though.  it's the typical canned red stuff.  It would have been a much better experience with something fresh and more flavorful.  I would definitely order from here again, but only until I find something better ;)"}
{"text":"This is a stereotypical Canadian-Chinese experience.  It reminds me of being a kid when this was more or less the only Chinese-stype food one could get in Toronto.  That's what I like about it.  You can choose from the fixed menus or order a la carte.  Either or are fine.  We tend to order a bit of this and a bit of that.  Usually fixed menu as a base and then two or two other dishes.  We live in the neighbourhood, but we don't tend to order takeout from this place more than two times a year or so.  That adds up over fifteen years or so.  Generally, we are happy with this place.  That said, it depends who is cooking.  This is why I am giving it a middle rating.     Sometimes when we order, the food is fresh and just awesome for what it is.  Perfect. The sweet sour wontons or pork crunchy.  The chicken balls are a bit more doughy than I'd like.  Bright red sauce on the side.  The fried rice is flavourful enough.  The vegetable dishes are good.   Nice balance of vegetables.  Generous portions of meat to vegetable.  The General Tso chicken or beef is sauced and flavoured just enough.  Shrimp and squid dishes are good too.  On the other hand, sometimes we have the misfortune of having a very different style of cook though.  One probably who has background in mall cuisine because there is little subtlety in his/ her creations.  The vegetable dishes more like slop slippery.  Far too much celery and onion, not enough of the other vegetables or meat that are supposed to be there.  Little flavour.  Sometimes too with this cook the meat is overdone and has lost its flavour and texture.  Too bad about the disappointing times that we've ordered.  We try not to get our hopes up too much when we order.  After a bad batch, it tends to be a while before we risk it again."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is still open! The customer service is poor with attitude. Gave them the benefit of the doubt and still ordered. BIG MISTAKE. Took an hour and forty five minutes! Called the restaurant at an hour past to see if they had forgotten and she said that \"he just left\"?!?! Asked the delivery man what took so long he said we ordered a lot of food?! LOL OK. The food was cold, condensation built up at the lids of the containers and the food tasted super salty and had a bitter after taste. On top of it all they forgot our drinks. I can only imagine what it would be like to dine in! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place has \"solid\" food. The thai curries are good and the green curry lamb is good as it's not gamey at all. The reason for such a high rating is owed to their customer service.  We used to order their food through just eat. But for a month or two there they weren't on just eat, so I called in to order some items. The girl who helped me was very accommodating and very pleasant. The food arrived promptly and everything we ordered was hot, fresh and enjoyable. Worth trying if what you're looking for is a no-frills, delivery type, thai meal after a long work day."}
{"text":"My house is 6 minutes away from the restaurant and they didn't want to make a delivery very disappointed. The girl that talk to me on the phone was very rude and hung up while I was talking."}
{"text":"We weren't in the mood to spend Halloween night mingling with the unwashed masses, so we decided to order in some Thai food. I was purposefully looking for a restaurant we hadn't tried before, and Dragon Delight seemed like a good choice.  There was a bit of a snafu with the ordering process - the restaurant didn't receive our order for some reason, so I had to call to confirm that we would, in fact, be getting food at some point - but when the meal did arrive, everything was impressively hot and fresh.  We ordered three things:  Thai Spring Roll (Pho Pia Phak) (\"Glass Noodles with veg in Thai Pastry with our Thai Plumsauce\"): These spring rolls were actually quite different than your usual spring rolls, in that, as advertised, they were indeed filled with noodles. There was other stuff going on in there, too, and I'll admit I enjoyed the heck out of this. It was almost like eating an Asian noodle dish in spring roll form.  Malay Curry Chicken (\"Spicy Malaysian style curry cooked in our delicious curry sauce with traditional Malaysian spices, chicken, onions, potatoes, eggplant, tomatoes and coriander. Served with steamed rice.\"): First of all, how refreshing to order a dish like this that already comes with rice. I've all-too-often found myself riceless while eating dishes that are clearly meant to be accompanied by rice. Aside from that, this was a seriously tasty bowl of food. It's incredibly spicy and yet it still boasts some strong flavors, while the chicken and other ingredients are quite plentiful and well-cooked.  Stir Fried Glass Noodles with Chicken and Shrimp (Phad Woon Sen) (\"Thin glass noodles with red peppers, green peppers, broccoli, black mushrooms and egg\"): This dish, while good, wasn't quite as tasty as the Malay Curry Chicken. Though the ingredients all worked quite well together and the noodles weren't too soggy, there was a predominant spice in the dish that kind of took over. (I think it was basil.) Still, this was definitely a good dish and a refreshing change of pace from the usual Thai flavors."}
