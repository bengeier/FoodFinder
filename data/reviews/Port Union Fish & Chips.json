{"text":"Agree with previous reviewers that the batter is quite light - almost tempura-like texture.  The fries are fresh cut, thick and yummy.

Ordered the Chef's Special for $7.99 which included two huge pieces of fish (pollack) and a mound of fries - very good deal.

Two areas of disappointment:
1) tartar sauce is not homemade and offered up in the little plastic packages - how disappointing
2) no coleslaw was provided.  It may have been because I ordered the special but I would expect coleslaw to be standard with any fish n' chips order.

I may keep looking for my fave fish n' chips place."}
{"text":"When you've found a place that makes better Fish and Chips than you've had in the UK, you know you've done good.

Everything here is made from the scratch, right down to the tartar sauce. I hate when you go to other places and they give you those horrible plastic packets of \"tartar\" sauce straight from the factory. Port Union Fish and Chips makes their own, with tiny little pieces of hand cut gherkin speckled throughout.

I always get their Halibut and Chips dinner. It really is perfect. The batter to fish ratio is spot on.   Super thin and crispy, the batter is a mere shell for the beautifully tender fish underneath.

The chips are as they should be, thick cut and cooked in shortening. Douse them in a little Malt Vinegar and Salt and you are good to go.

The kicker here is their coleslaw. The dressing is creamy, and has this wicked mellow lemony flavour to it. Definitely unique, and unlike any coleslaw I've had before.

My family has been coming here for years, and the food is always consistent. Totally worth the drive if you are coming in from the west end!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Stay away. Ordered the grilled salmon and the chicken combo. Both tasted like they were \"grilled\" in the deep fryer cooking oil. They were extremely dry and bland other than the cooking oil taste. The popcorn shrimp was inedible. The fries, thinking \"you can't screw that up\" had no taste. The clam chowder, only after having it reheated and dumping sriracha sauce on it was salvageable.  I can keep ranting but if what I've written above doesn't dissuade you, than you're looking for a bad meal."}
{"text":"Excellent place for fish and chips. The fish of choice is Alaskan Pollock, which I find nice and dense. The batter is excellent, and the fries amazing. The tarter sauce is amazing, and served in a convenient squeeze bottle. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times as it is the closest fish and chips place to my house. Their chips are the best, proper size and cut and always cooked well. Their fish batter however is severly lacking. Note this is not your official fish batter. If your looking for traditional english style fish go to Malt N Salt which is 5mins away. 

However if you like a more light and crispier batter this might be the place for you. They have an ALL YOU CAN EAT fish & chips deal on Tuesdays for $9.99 which is great if you can eat more then one serving. 

I took one star off because their prices are higher then the competition. Their Haddock & Chips is $8.99 which is much pricier then the other places I've been to in the area.

Their menu is diverse and they offer a LOT of fish & chips options which is very nice, including family packs. I'd recommend trying it once, but for a more regular routine Malt N Salt is still a better deal.

(They offer senior discounts)"}
{"text":"I was around this area and stopped by this Fish and Chips restaurant. I was very pleased with the friendly service. The fish and chips are lightly battered, well seasoned and tasted fresh! Would come back here again :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the chef's lunch special (haddock and chips). Service was excellent and price was very very reasonable for the portion that they give you. I would have liked the coating on the fish to be more crispy but the fries were nice and I always love good fries!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a nice place with in house dining and take out. The fish is excellent, maybe some of the best I've had. The only down side is the cost. It seems (to me, but then again I'm cheap) too expensive. I might have fish and chip two three times a year and at their prices that's about all I can afford."}
{"text":"Friendly service and tasty food. Can't beat the value, tons of fish for your dollar. Got two pieces of cod and large chips for $7.99 can't beat that deal, halibut is inexpensive for those who won't eat any other type of fish. Several dollars cheaper per meal than comparable fish restaurants. Will visit again. Convenient location near 401, lots of parking."}
{"text":"I ordered the regular fish and chips its like a tempura style batter on the fish and chips were decent as well. Its was okay but not super convinced to go back as the price was about 10$ more than what I'm used to for a single order of fish and chips. The gravy however was very delicious and they give you plenty in a little container"}
{"text":"My cousin recommended this place last week and I happened to be in the neighbourhood around lunch time so I thought I'd give it a try.

There is quite a bit of space in the restaurant, with two main dining areas and a couple of patio tables outside. The decor is mostly blue and has a definite dockside theme. It kinda reminded me of some touristy seafood restaurants I've been to in Florida. It was clean.

I was a bit surprised to find I was the only diner n the restaurant at 1:30pm in the afternoon. Isn't that prime lunch time? My server, having nothing else to do, was very attentive. I chose the Chef's Fish & Chips and an appetizer serving of chicken wings (4pcs) with BBQ sauce on the side.

It didn't take long for my food to arrive (the chef probably had nothing else to do either). I received two long thin pieces of crispy golden brown fish with coleslaw and a separate basket of fries. It was a very generous serving! The chicken wings also looked nice and crispy.

The fish had a nice crispy texture and tasted good. The tartar sauce was just right, maybe house-made? The fish was Pollock, similar to cod but not as \"fishy\" tasting.

I had asked for the BBQ sauce on the side for the wings but I wouldn't recommend doing that. The sauce was nice but I couldn't detect any seasoning on the chicken. It was bland. with the sauce, however, it tasted good. Don't order the wings naked like I did.

It was a good meal.I would go back."}
{"text":"After getting a random craving for fish and chips,went to Port Union Fish & Chips. Nice location with the decor to match the restaurant menu and theme, and overall comfortable environment. Nice staff. 

Ordered the Haddock & Chips for take out. $8.99. 

Got home size of the box didn't really appeal to me, but the food looked good and fresh. Their menu does say lightly battered but didn't except the coating to be really really light. Fried correctly to crispy golden perfection, The fish was perfect, no complaints there. Fries looked like they didn't come out of a frozen bag and were cooked well, but could use a bit more salt. The taste overall was just okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Its just fried potatoes and fish but the batter just tasted....meh. Surprisingly I was full after my meal.  

What was a major disappointed as mention in previous reviews is lack of in house tartar sauce. Was not expecting that, not a big fan of that.   

The Haddock & Chips, gets a 3/5. cooked well, but tasted whatever, and pre-packaged tarter sauce is bland."}
{"text":"I'll make this quick.  Food was alright, waitress did not check up on me if everything was alright and did not refill my water which she should without me asking.  I had to go to the waitress's podium to pay which I'm guessing they didn't have a wireless machine or a receipt holder.  And the TV nearby was at a low volume, like if they put it there for people to see what's on the news, what's the point if you can't hear the news casters?"}
{"text":"I love their fish and chips! It's a lighter batter which is great. As well, the owner and the other employees are really nice and customer service is so important to me. My favourite place to get fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and the food was very good. We all ordered the fish and chips (which is half of their menu). It was great. If you are a die hard fan of battered fish, they have an all your can eat lunch I think on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Really fresh fish and chips!  Shrimp, clams, and scallops were equally fresh, which is exceptional for a f&c spot."}
