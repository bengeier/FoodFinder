{"text":"One of my favourite spots to grab breakfast and lunch in the area. A lot of nearby office workers and construction workers come here for a quick bite.  Spicy pork and chicken souvlaki are my personal go to.  Make sure you ask for extra spicy if that's how you roll.  Owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"My go to place for Chinese BBQ pork, duck or roast pork. The family owned take-out joint has been around for ages and is ran by the son of the original owners. Service is quick and courteous with mom at the till and son and/or dad serving up the delicious meat morsels. The food is always consistently good: i would recommend the crispy skinned roast pork or the amazing BBQ duck. If you're going to get the BBQ pork (char siew), look for a fatty piece. Drools. 

This is not a restaurant so there's no place to sit and dine. It's just take out."}
{"text":"This is an inconspicuous little space. It's next to a Bay station entrance, and can, ironically, get overlooked. I come here for lunch, and it's strictly a take-out restaurant. I've only tried the bulgogi burger, which was fantastic. They give a fair amount of meat, and the favours come together nicely without being too salty. I love their fries too (they taste like Costco fries, and if you haven't tried them, you're missing out). If burgers, fries, and other fried foods aren't your thing, they've also got salads... Something I'll definitely try on my next visit. And most importantly, the prices are fair. If you work in the area like me, you'll appreciate that your wallet won't take a beating here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite chinese bbq meat place in Calgary.  It is a takeout only place.  The rice combos are the best - they are under $10 and you get to pick two meat types or you can get just duck which I think it a few dollars more. I find that I never finish more than half the box even when I'm really hungry.  This is also my top choice when I'm entertaining or bringing food over to someone's house. I find that every one really enjoys it.  My favourites are the bbq pork, roasted pork, sausage, duck and the soya chicken."}
{"text":"Another lovely little lunch joint in the heart of Yorkville, a true hidden gem. This small 200 sq ft shop packs a lot of good stuff. The menu is filled with cheap eats at good prices and the staff there are friendly, efficient and welcoming. 

I've tried the spicy chicken rice and the bulgogi burger, both were good. I heard someone order a bulgogi poutine  off their \"secret menu\" and apparently it's delicious - will try next time."}
{"text":"Tip:  Takeout ONLY!  Passed the sliding glass doors, it's literally an order counter.  So no room to sit.

A gem in an otherwise overpriced area for food!

As part of a makeover show, the salon owner ordered lunch for the group.  It's fast food from a mom and pop, but burger did not taste frozen and was well-seasoned!  Patty was quite thick and juicy.

Located right next to a small entrance to Bay Station, you'd literally walk by if you didn't know it was there.  I did not see the prices, but based on the photo provided by another reviewer, it seems very, very reasonable!

If you've got a place to eat, i.e. an office, the rock at Yorkville, your home, check this place out!"}
{"text":"When my parents were visiting, we did some shopping at the TOPS Supermarket that's just off 16th avenue on center street NW. After browsing on my own, I found my dad but my mom was no-where to be seen. Shortly after, we discovered that she walked down the street to BBQ Express - I didn't even know this place existed and apparently my mom, who hardly ever comes to Calgary knew it existed - she must have had those BBQ duck senses..

Anyways, they are right next to a Vietnamese place and there's a parking lot available. It is exactly what their name is \"Bbq express\" - they offer BBQ Pork, BBQ Duck, Soya Chicken, Sausage, BBQ ribs, and even Roasted pig's head if you order in advance.  When you enter, it smells amazing - delicious Chinese BBQ aroma.  You can see all the meats through a glass shield where they are hanging. They only do takeout and only take cash.

My mom had ordered half BBQ duck and a pound and a half of BBQ pork. You can select which hanging meat you want to be cut from. The duck is chopped into small pieces and I'm not sure if they cut the BBQ pork but we did ask for it to be cut as well, they also pour some sauce on the BBQ pork. Both orders filled a decent size styrofoam container and you are given a bag of soya sauce, duck sauce and some packets of plum sauce.

When we got home, we put on a pot of rice and cooked up some vegetables to go with our protein. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM fresh rice with BBQ duck and pork is one of my favorite combos!! I especially love duck with plum sauce, DROOOLLLLL. The BBQ duck was really good...tender and fatty with a slight crisp on the skin, the BBQ pork was good too, a little tougher but still really tasty, the fatty parts are the best. 

BBQ Express is a really great place - if you want some reasonably priced delicious Chinese BBQ meats, this is the place to hit up! What a gem of a place if you need to pick up something to bring to a pot luck or if you want to pick up something for lunch/dinner that is quick and tasty. They offer a lunch box special until 3pm(?) which is any two meats with rice, duck is an additional cost because it's so darn good. They are open every day from 10am - 7PM except they are closed on Tuesdays.

I can't stop thinking about the BBQ meats here, must go ASAP!!!!"}
