{"text":"Been twice and must say the burgers are delish.  The pickles are snappy and thick.  Fries fresh and hot.  Perfect place for an indulge."}
{"text":"They have good burgers, the patties are pretty thin though. This place reminds me so much of Steak and Shake in Indiana where I used to live so the food kinda sends me back there for a minute haha. Otherwise, it's a very clean place with good food. I recommend this restaurant as a good change of pace from other fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious and everyone was so polite. As you place your order the cashiers are very welcoming and not one bit rude. Austin in particular was very helpful. He was busy and I asked for a lid, then minutes later he double checked that he did give me the lid just because he was so busy. He even waited for me to gather my things and stroller and opened the doors for me without me asking. The service here is outstanding. Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"ok, for a fast food restaurant, THIS is the place to be.  I called to order an ice cream cake.  I saw online their policy was that they needed 72 hours to make a special order cake.  So, I called them to see what cakes they had available and what they would have the next day as I didn't have 72 hours.  They said 'tell me what you are looking for and we will have it made tomorrow.\" I gave them some weird combos of toppings, trying to get all my daughters favorites captured.  They gave great suggestions and personal favorites. It was ready on time and way more yummy than I expected! Super great customer service!! way more than I expected from a fast food place."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is Awesome! Not a huge fan of the Custard ( I prefer Neilsons), but the food was great!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the FOURTH time in less than a month they did not have what I ordered. Twice they were  making more ice cream and said it would only take a few minutes. The first time I waited, their 'few' minutes  ended up taking 20 minutes. The second time I said forget it and took my business to Culver's instead. Tonight was the second time they didn't have a sandwich l ordered. I was stuck in line for just over 10 minutes and when I asked for the name of the manager, I was told they had several and the server was too confused (or unwilling) to give me a name. I left and will not return. It's a shame. It's a convenient location for me and I used to get waited on swiftly with good customer service. But no more. 4 strikes and you're out. :-("}
{"text":"Great food fries rings burgers are fantastic and kills Culvers"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend last week for the first time. The employees are very friendly and kind. I was impressed with all the choices of flavors for the frozen custard. My friend ate dinner and I had dessert. Very delicious custard and not too expensive either. I'll be back- the food and service were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food and staffed by employees and managers who are on top of everything.  Employees are always cleaning and super friendly.  This is my favorite location and I would pass other places to eat here.  I ate there today and it was great!  Smiles and quick service with great tasting food.  A winning combination!!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my sister and brother-in-law, and all I can say is that I got hooked.  

I have been here a couple of times and each time I usually get the double steakburger with cheese and fries.  The steakburger is thinner than a regular burger, but the taste is fantastic.

I also like to get their chocolate brownie delight sundae.  It is probably one of the best sundaes I have ever had.  If you are a chocolate fan, than this is definitely something that you will want to try.

I just saw on their website that they are planning to open a Freddy's in Henderson, NV, which is right in my neighborhood, so I am pretty stoked about that."}
{"text":"This was my first and LAST time visiting this restaurant. I had the single steakburger. I asked for no onions. I got mustard and two sliced pickles. No mayo/ketchup/lettuce/tomatoes. Nor did I get offered This burger was a real joke and a even bigger disappointment. It will NOT KEEP ME COMING BACK!!!! I can't believe I paid almost $4.00 for this fast food, pounded to death, tasteless, paper thin piece of meat. I don't know, maybe they felt like I wasn't spending enough money to give me a outrageous Freddy's experience. I will post pictures."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes in the drive-through line at 9pm with no other cars in front of me. This is the longest drive-through wait time I've ever experienced and I won't be returning. Fries were not that great. Custard was good and burger was ok too."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to having great burgers but they were way to thin, so thin you can see through them. I wouldn't waste my calories on it again. But I like the seasoning you can put on your hamburger and fries, that is what made it good. But the custard is to die for! I'll never go back to ice cream again. If I ever go back to Freddy's it will be for only dessert."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to eat out at Freddy's. This is one of those places that I always take my out-of-town friends so they can try it. Freddy's  burgers are great, don't get me wrong they're still fast food burgers but they're as good as fast food comes. They're fries are unstoppable though, they're a thin cut fry with the perfect crisp outside and soft inside. They also use a great season salt on them. My wife loves their custards and there are a ton of options to choose from.

Lastly the staff is great! You know how sometimes you go to a fast food joint and now matter how much the staff smiles you can tell they hate their lives? At Freddy's you don't get that, the staff is always happy and helpful, I always get great service here."}
{"text":"Their chili cheese fries are to die for!  Be sure to ask for a side if fry sauce to either drizzle over them or at least just dip the somewhat dry fries in at the end.

The burgers are tasty, but I'd prefer In n Out's small patty burgers over these especially for the cost. 

What keeps me going back is the cleanliness of the restaurant. The friendliness of the staff, oh and did I mention the fry sauce?!?"}
{"text":"Not good nor bad. Personally inn & out burger is better as well as five guys. I wasn't all that impressed. There is nothin I hate more then eating super dry meat. And that's what this burger was, I don't think I'll go back well maybe to try the ice cream."}
{"text":"Just moved here stopped in for some food and the food is great, not greasy looking. Very tasty. The staff is super nice. And caring, I will forever come back to this location because of them. They made my visit and very happy worthwhile one. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is my preferred Freddy's location.  First of all, not the closest one to me, but the staff here just won my family over (and over!).  So for this review I will start with the service.

THE SERVICE:  The team here knows the true meaning of customer service. Our 3rd time at the location, they sort of missed our order. We watched as other customers who came in minutes after us get their food. My hubby then approached the counter to express that we have yet to receive ours.  They quickly got to it. As we waited, the staff member who took our order, came to our table to apologize. Our food was delivered shortly after by a team member and the manager. One of the manager's Zach sincerely apologized for the delay and gave us a couple of cards for what I thought was just going to be free custard. Surely, that would have already made me happy, but NO! Freddy's is all about the customer. You are inconvenienced, they make sure they make up for it and you leave happy. They were actually cards for free meal combos or custard if we so prefer. The delay was no biggie for us really and we were grateful and all chill about it as long as we got our food, but Zach made sure to check back with us, and make sure our meal was to our liking.  WOW!  So does the amaze-balls end there?  We head back to Freddy's a week or so later, Andrew comes out to greet us and welcome us back. We casually chat, and later on, he comes back to surprise us with a gift of more free meals for simply being such loyal customers and for coming back. We haven't even used our free cards from last time. TO ZACH AND TEAM, THANK YOU! You guys are the epitome of customer service.

THE FOOD: Well, if you haven't had a custard or a burger from Freddy's you might as well be living under a rock.  Kidding aside, you gotta try it.  Burgers are absolutely delicious. An original  comes with 2 patties that are thin and grilled to perfection.  Oh, and the fries with the fry sauce. So good.  Not greasy at all, and always crispy.

THE PLACE: Clean, very spacious with outdoor seating. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Hit this place as a back-up once when I was too late for Five Guys. Surprisingly good, and well priced. Love the really skinny fries. Custard is above average, but I'd go back anytime for the burgers."}
{"text":"Never again.  Overpriced for what you get.  My husband and I went here because he loved Steak N Shake.  This is close to home so we stopped in.  Plus they have a black bean burger.  We ordered our food, which came out right on the receipt.  My burger was to have onion and lettuce.  It came out with cheese, onion and lettuce.  I went to take it to the counter but a man working there stopped me.  I explained the issue.  And he says \"You want tomato, lettuce and onion?\" I never said tomato.  After communicating that, I tried to hand him the food basket and he kept looking at me.  Eventually he took it.  Off he went.  The burger came back the second time fine.  He looked at my husband and asked how his burger was.  We told him that he waited for me to eat.  He looks at me and says \"Aww isn't that nice\".  There was no \"sorry about the mistake.\"  \"Hope you enjoy your food.\"  Nothing.  The burger itself was over processed.  I've had great black bean burgers at other places.  This was bland.  Never again."}
{"text":"The shoestring fries are really good. However the burger patties are so thin, I wish I would of gotten a double. The custard was amazing. I had vanilla custard with hot fudge on it. I had never tried custard before. Now I know why the teletubbies couldn't get enough of that tubbie custard!!!"}
{"text":"even with grumpy old hens as customers the staff is so nice.  i am having a double steakburger. The neat is well seasoned and carmelized smash style. these shoe string fries are so tasty and perfectly crispy. I like how they let u season your own fries. and Yippee its time for concrete pumpkin sundae time"}
{"text":"Such good food.
I have yet to try something here that isn't excellent. The burgers are amazing, their fries are my favorite, and the custard is incredible (PBC & B every time)"}
{"text":"Yo this Freddy's right here is tasty. I get the California burger with fries and a coke and I just on nom nom that shizzle up! Gimme dem fries."}
{"text":"First time here and ordered the double California burger and the fudge brownie concrete mixer. They were both absolutely amazing! My boyfriend ordered their Chicago dog and although tasty, it didn't have much on it. I will definitely be going back however!"}
{"text":"I was craving chili cheese fries...and looked up Freddy's on Yelp, i saw their menu and some pictures of the chili fries and they looked amazing! I got there at 10:30pm on a friday. The employee who took my order was so nice and so helpful. I ordered the chili cheese fries and I also ordered a double steak burger California style and the original one. I got my food and it smelled amazing! The drive home was so long! Haha. I tried the chili cheese fries and errmahgerrddd! So so so delicious! Then i tried the burger and it has got to be one of the most delicious burgers ive ever had. It was so tasty, did not need anything else on it. It was amazing. I will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"I have LOVED Freddy's since we took a family vacation to Schlitterbaun (water park in Texas) and stumbled in one.  At that point we were exhausted and starving from being at the water park and Freddy's was AWESOME food.

One day I thought hey, I wonder if they have any Freddy's out West and found the one on Bell Road.  We loaded up the SUV and drove from Gilbert to Glendale AND the drive was worth it!  We once again LOVED our meal at Freddy's!

We ended up driving to Glendale about once a month to eat at Freddy's, begging them to open a location out in the East Valley - FINALLY it opened - just as we moved to SoCal : (

When ever we get back to Arizona we ALWAYS eat at Freddy's.  Why?

The burgers are \"steak burgers\", high quality meat with seasoning.  The fries are seasoned just right...addicting!  They have free drink refills and the place is old school looking.  THE REAL KICKER...the frozen custard!  WOW, I love their frozen custard creations!

They have other menu items, but the steak burger is just fine for me!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of the midwest's Steak n Shake with shoestring fries and thin burgers!!  Love the crispy edges on the burgers!!  Yum!  Friendly service and delicious food. Store is looking a little aged with tears in seats. But the food and service is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with a co-worker to check out Freddy's. I ordered a single steakburger California style and a Signature Turtle. Price came out to almost $10. The Turtle was delicious but the burger left much to be desired. Hardly any meat and it was burnt. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great customer service!  They did screw up our order at the drive they but when we came back and brought it to their attention the refunded the price of the entire meal, gave us a comp card for a meal and a custard for next time we come. The bottom line is everyone makes mistakes but when you go out of your way to apologize and make it right you earn our business again. Sad more aren't like this."}
{"text":"I've only enjoyed Freddy's steakburgers a couple of times but have never personally been in/ordered from the establishment myself until today. Decided to go through the drive-thru today around 3p, however, had I known how long of a wait it would be I would have opted to maybe go inside. But then again, when I looked in the windows during my long wait, the dining area appeared to be completely empty. So they weren't overwhelmed inside, nor in the drive-thru as there were only 2 cars ahead and one behind me. Alas, delicious, freshly made food is worth the wait and I understand it is not your run-of-the-mill fast food burger joint. But 15 minutes seemed excessive, especially since the car ahead of me only ordered a couple of concretes. 

When I got to the window I was not greeted, unless you consider your tab quoted to you without a smile an actual greeting. Simply put, the female cashier wasn't very friendly, but, she wasn't rude either. I've been to McDonald's or Wendy's for less than quality food, but always quality customer service, a greeting with a smile, etc. As simple as it is, it goes a long way. Oh, and I got jipped on my fry sauce :( read the reviews and tips on here and was really looking forward to trying it out. 

Overall, always tasty and I was satisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"Great service. However the food was such a bad deal I will never go back. Way over priced and the \"custard\" is not custard at all. If u want real custard then go to Ritas. Don't go here if you are hungry. I just was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries. I really like the custard. The California style burger is what I order each time."}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit. Fries were good but the burger was just ok. As far as the service, TERRIBLE. I ordered a cheeseburger, small fry and a diet dr pepper....I received a double hamburger, no cheese and they didnt give me my drink! I won't be back."}
{"text":"Finally a place in Arizona where I can enjoy a Chicago-style dog that actually tastes like one!!! So, for all you fellow Chicagoans that are missing hot dogs in the only way that Chicago makes them, head on over to Freddy's!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit. I tried the Patty Melt Combo no onions. It was hot and tasty, the menu said a double mine only had one piece of meat. It was still really good. We also got the kids Grilled Cheese Combo and Bacon and Cheese Double Steakburger Combo. All the food came out pretty fast with nice crispy fries. The dining area was dirty with no clean booths. I did ask an employee if I could have a towel to clean a table for us, they didn't offer to clean the table for us. After eating dinner we did order some custards. The custard did take a long time which was surprising, because the sandwiches came out so fast. The price was pretty too."}
{"text":"Oh, this place is amazing. Steak burgers are fantastic, and their fries...damn!!! We had been going to Culver's before, but Freddy's is now our go to guilty pleasure. Their fries are probably the best fast food fries I've ever had. My wife agrees we me on that, and she also agrees the burgers are AMAZING!!!  So glad we decided to give em a try, found the best place for burgers and fries!!!"}
{"text":"The gentleman taking my order was very friendly. He took the time to explain some of the menu to me because it was my first time there. The custard he let me sample was amazing. I ended up buying one. The food was really good. The only negative was that I ordered a double meat but it felt like I had only one."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The dogs and hamburgers are cooked decently, but their hotdogs and side of fries are tiny!!! I could make bigger (and probably tastier) ones at home. So the fries are thin. Big friggn' deal. It's all in like a 5 oz. cup, where's the value? I guess I just don't see what the rave is about considering they are much smaller and cost much more than other hamburger places. 

We seriously felt ripped off and hungry afterwards. The custard is pretty good, that's like the only thing worth coming here for. They should have better description for the food at the drive-thru, and better trained staff, (they overcharged us and didn't get the order correct)."}
{"text":"Luv dis place!  The sunny smiles greet you by the friendly staff as soon as you come in.  Recon the restaurant, and it looks like a retro soda shop (which is definitely part of the vibe).  Their steakburgers are cooked fresh, a bit of crispness on the edge, nice and moist.  Dogs are good.  Fries are thin and not full of flavor...but that's what their \"fry sauce\" is for the dipping.

Their fried pickles are just ok....Short Leash Hot Dogs makes a bigger and more flavorful one...these are small and not as flavorful.  Good with the ranch dipping sauce.

Luv their Turtle Sundae: custard with (usually) hot caramel and fudge sauce drizzled down it with nuts and whipped cream and cherry on top.  Heavenly!

Service is usually pretty quick, even when busy.  This is one of those places where you order at the counter and then pick up when they call you.

Place is kept clean, tables wiped down.  Come on down!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to think about Freddy's. I was super excited to try another Frozen Custard place (I heart Culver's) and this place is a hit or miss. The burger is alright but I keep giving it a chance hoping that it's a mistake on my part in the ordering process - I keep getting the California style. Keep in mind that ordering was the problem I had at In n Out until I found my groove.  
The one thing I adore here are the fries. OH. EM. GEE. These little shoe string guys are the BEST. I think they sprinkle salt and pepper on them. I think I'll try them INSIDE my hamburger next time."}
{"text":"We ate at Freddy's today on Baseline and we feel that this particular establishment is not what it was when we moved here 3 years ago.  The staff doesn't greet you and nothing is even said to you when you approach the counter to order.  The tabkes appeared as though they hadn't been wiped clean, condiment area was unkept and shakers on the table were empty at some tables.  I must say that we will start  going to the Hampton site in the future and will trybto find a different establishment when out farther on Baseline."}
{"text":"This place was great! I really enjoyed the burgers. Will definitely be coming back real soon."}
{"text":"i dug it. their hotdogs are bomb. they are using vienna, i believe. and they come on buttered toasted bread. i get mine w grilled onions on top.

their fries are some of the best EVER. super thin, perfectly crisp, and perfectly seasoned. The seasoning tastes a bit garlicky and not sure what else was in it. 

the burgers are not as good as culvers but they are good. 

and the custard is pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Freddy's is totally grub. I'm down with the Double California Burger which is Freddy's take on an In & Out burger. I love how the meat hangs an inch out of the bun and the texture of the meat is so different from other burgers. The frozen custard is tasty and not that expensive. The kids and I get the dirt & worms and fight over the gummi worms. This place will satisfy the occasional greasy gut bomb craving. I'm looking forward to trying the Chicago dog and chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"Feel like kickin it ol' school?  Freddy's is the place to go!  
Great burger and fry joint! The steak burgers are fresh patties made to order. They have a home cooked taste not the frozen fast food burger! Yes, they even have Veggie burgers too! You can get darn near anything you like on it ! The Fry's are fresh cut and seasoned or you can top them with cheese or chili. 

I tried a little of everything and my favorite is the chili dog! Tastes like I remember growing up as a kid. The custard sundaes are amazing ! My favorite is the PBC&B mmmm good!

I like that they sell their seasonings so I can grill up the great taste at home!  Great family fun atmosphere.

{"text":"This place has the best taste of burger because of steak meat and fry are outstanding.  Good food for a fast food place."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night after dinner for some custard.  We split a small cup of vanilla which was a mistake because after taking a few bites I wanted scoops more.  Anyway, the vanilla custard is fantastic!  Very rich, creamy, sweet and delicious.  I honestly cannot wait to have it again!!"}
{"text":"Freddy's is my go-to diner burger after In N Out. The burgers are tasty and the fries are shoestring delicious! The concretes and shakes will have you beggin on your knees!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here just good food! Culvers type hamburgers and custard. Food came fast and place was clean. Not much more to report, bring an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Freddy's is not a restaurant for the health conscious, those with finicky tummies, or people who dab their pizza with napkins. Grease is ubiquitous at Freddy's, it's like a inescapable condiment. Hell, the soda is greasy.  If this bothers you, you may want to eat somewhere healthier. Like anywhere else in the world. 

But, damn, these burgers are good. They fry them up on a griddle until they're just a bit crispy around the edges while still being juicy and tender in the middle. Your options are pretty limited, cheese or no cheese, one set of toppings or another. That's okay though. They do it all well. They have hot dogs as well, but I haven't really bothered with them. I can make my own hot dog. The fries are shoestring style, which seems to be popular these days, but I prefer a little thicker cut. Still good though, especially when topped with their 'special' salt.

Then there's the frozen custard... I was a bit skeptical, as I don't like most frozen yogurt, hate soft serve, and generally am unimpressed with ice cream. But this stuff was amazing. It is incredibly smooth and rich, with just a hint of egg underneath the vanilla or chocolate flavor. Really, really delicious. Like everything here, the prices on the frozen custard (FroCu?) are very decent. Honestly, it's about as good as Culver's or any other steakburger joint for the regular stuff, but the frozen custard really makes it stand out as a favorite."}
{"text":"Usually I love this place but I just completely lost my appetite when my husband spit out a baby cock roach out of his custard. One of the grossest things to happen to me at this place.  Usually I love their burgers and food but this was just the topping on the cake. I know bugs get into supplies sometimes but that was a mood killer for me. At least we got 2 complimentary meals for next time I guess..."}
{"text":"Staff courteous but disappointed over the custard.  I made a special trip to try it out but it wasn't worth the effort. I will say the burgers are very tasty and that IS something I will come back for.  Guess I just wanted the whole \"frozen custard\" theme to be more exotic and unusual than it was. It's basically just more eggy ice cream."}
{"text":"The closest thing to Steak n Shake in AZ. I had the pizza burger, it was okay but not fantastic. I will go again soon, but for now they get a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"I finally tried their steak burger California style and it was very good. Tasted very fresh kinda like In and Out. I think I still might like In and Outs burgers better, however, Freddys still makes a mean chili dog! I can't quite give this place 5 stars though because I figured out last time that I really am not a fan of their fries. Everyone has their preferences of what fries should be and these are just not for me. Still have to try their custard. Service is great though and restaurant clean. Freddy's is still a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Our first and last visit eating at a Freddy's. Not sure what the hype is all about burgers were thin and tasteless. Burgers reminded me of the bits of burnt pieces that get let behind on the grill. Fries were nice and crispy. Defitnely not worth the $50 we spent on lunch. Should have just went the place next door instead of trying something new."}
{"text":"Quality burger and fries, nothing mind blowing. The chili is really tasty but a little pricey for \"fast food.\" Bonus points for the fry sauce dispensers inside."}
{"text":"Great chicago dog!! Amazing bite of the original cheeseburger. It really hits the spot when it comes to fast food. Most likely will be my go to for fast hamburger/custard/hot dog."}
{"text":"Ok, This was a terrible experience. I won't be back and it was my first time at a Freddy's. First off, yes, i read the reviews, and yes I expected thin, crispy hamburger patties, but my sandwich looked like it was made with the scrapings off the griddle. I really drove the 8.6 miles to try one of their custards everyone says is the best, but, their custard machine was down. What?? Yep. Then, after placing my order, and the girl told me she would give me my total at the window, I proceeded to literally wait 9 minutes for one car ahead of me to get their order so I could roll forward. At the window, I saw my bagged food sitting on the counter waiting for me, but the girl taking orders proceeded to have me wait another 2 minutes while she took someone else's order, then told me my total was $9.13. I had a $20 and dug for the 13 cents, which took all of 10 seconds, and looked up and she was gone with the window closed taking another order. Tick tick tick, and then she returns to take my money. Window closes, she takes another order while I watch her digging for change from the cash drawer. Window opens about 95 seconds later and she hands me a $10 and 98 cents!!  I said, \"I shouldn't be receiving change, I gave you 13 cents\" she looks at me and rudely replies \"it was $9.15\". Unreal. So instead of letting me know I was short two cents, because really, who would give change if it doesn't round up to the next dollar, or at least to avoid pennies, she just processed the sale. I am shocked, disappointed and really worried for the future of our country if this is what customer service looks like moving forward. Freddy got fingered as I drove off."}
{"text":"I always enjoy having a good double burger with everything on it when I visit in Gilbert.  The fries and the frozen custard are just additional temptations."}
{"text":"The burgers are good! The decor of this place is nice and I like the Nostalgia of it.. I really liked that they showed the History of Freddy on the walls. It's nice to know that there was a real guy who started this place & even nicer knowing he's a Veteran! If I find myself near the area again I will go back with out a doubt! Much better choice then the everyday fast food chains that clutter our city streets."}
{"text":"Wow.  The steak burgers at this place are amazing!  When I finished my burger I almost went to order another one!  But I was saving room for their homemade custard which is also 5 stars!

Can't wait to go back to try more stuff!"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers I didn't see much of the \"Golden State\" in the California burger.  All in all a decent burger option, if convenient, and above average fries/onion rings."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers and fries. People who like veggies and various toppings for the burgers will be disappointed though."}
{"text":"I have a certain affinity for anything named \"Freddy's,\" my friends can tell you why, so when I first had the chance to go to Freddy's Burgers a couple years ago I was excited. I went on the recommendation of a friend, and it's still one of my favourite chain burger joints. 

The burgers are made fresh to order, no heat lamps keeping your Big Mac warm here! The meat is so much better than your average fast food place. the buns are great and they always manage to get that awesome crispiness on the outside of the burger. My partner gets the patty melt, and keeps eating it even after she's unbuttoned her pants, mumbling, \"I'm so full... I really shouldn't eat any more.\" I LOVE the shoestring fries. I've never had an issue with soggy, cool fries. They're always hot, fresh and salted just enough. The Chicago Dogs are pretty darn good too. 

Get dessert! I'm a big fan of their frozen custard. My staple would be the turtle, with extra caramel. :) 

The whole atmosphere is nice and very retro. Oldies on the radio, HUGE booths so you don't have to worry about where you're going to fit everyone and clean. Clean is a big deal to me. i HATE going to fast food places where the remnants of the last dozen customers are all over the tables and floor."}
{"text":"The double original burger with cheese, onion, mustard and pickle was piping hot; delicious and near perfect.  The triple original I tried on a return visit was no improvement and perhaps a step down.  The fries are ok.  The iced tea is weak.

Freddy's BURGER is better than both 5 Guys AND in and out HANDS DOWN.  It is better than smash burger too."}
{"text":"Delicious food and always great service. I love the menu and the custard as well. Very helpful and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Stop by today for California Burger and I also their chocolate brownie delight sundae.  It is probably one of the best sundaes I have ever had.  If you are a chocolate fan, this place is definitely something that you will want to try. The help is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This location is very great. Employees are nice, place is nice and clean, and I love their ice cream! The burgers are a little greasy but taste great. I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The steak burgers and fries were good, and the restaurant was clean with friendly staff. About the quality I would expect from a fast food burger place. I didn't try the custard but it looked good."}
{"text":"The fries! Oh the fries are so good!!!! Thin and salty and crispy and  I could have eaten my weight in them.

I had a California style steakburger. I think it's a California style because of the lettuce, tomato, onion and Thousand Island dressing? The burger is thin and had nice crispy edges. It was good.

I also had a chocolate custard. In all honesty I didn't got the difference between custard and ice cream. I guess that I'll need a more discerning palate. Regardless, it had a nice strong chocolate flavor. I would like to try the sundaes and \"concretes\" aka custard with mix-ins. 

I'll probably give Freddy 3 stars but those fries deserve a star of their own."}
{"text":"I though the burger was decent. I was expecting way more for some reason. 

When I think steak burger I get all excited with anticipation. The burger tasted like any other fast food burger really. I got the california. Cheese was great. 

I like the fries a lot! They're super thin and crispy! I guess I'd come back but there's so any other better options."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious. The staff tonight was super polite and friendly. They all just seemed to be happy to be there and were also efficient, so quite refreshing after a full day of work!"}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY??

Oh yelp how i rely on you to stand up next to what you are claimed to be by the ratings. when i see 4 stars that means it should be more than just okay! Why am i so let down with all of these places? When i saw the word steak burger i was expecting blow my mind out of this world phenomena! Not your average smashed burger wannabe.
Don't get me wrong the flavor of the burger alone was decent but not worth $7 for a combo.  I LOVE french fries and these did NOT work for me. There was just a weird aftertaste. I couldn't put my finger on it but it was just weird.   As for the custard...

FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i had ordered a mini vanilla custard concrete with reeses peanut butter cups and i LOVE reeses peanut butter cups you literally have no idea. Next to the original two pack i also love the new mini cups you do not have to unwrap.  ANYWAYS back on track i get this concrete cup with a lid that is good for the car so it doesn't spill.  But the flavor was indeed rich and smooth but the flavor in general just lacked something to me. IDK what kind of peanut butter cups they used but they definitely were not reeses i can tell you that right now.  So dissapointed. If i were to try another concrete it will be strawberry cheesecake for sure. with extra sauce and what not to give it flavor.  But for now i am so mad at myself for spending $10 on BLAH food."}
{"text":"I ordered a hot dog for my son and it was completely rubber. I had to peel the skin to make it edible. This location just doesn't seem up to par with other Freddy's in the valley. Every time I come here I am greeted by a disgruntled teenager at the window. You'd think with the prices they charge they would have better quality and service."}
{"text":"If I wanted an Inn and Out burger. ...I would have went to Inn and Out. Sure, the frys are better here, but not enough to ever make me come back."}
{"text":"Fries were excellent and the burger was good.  Strawberry shake was really good too.  The employees were friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite. Can't believe how thin and crusty the burgers were. Onions where near whole. Fries where the best thing we had. That's pretty lousy for $50. The custard was tasteless also. Our first and last visit to a Freddies for sure. The staff was okay except they all looked like they could use a shower and laundered clothes."}
{"text":"Great steakburgers!  Awesome flavor !
Much cheaper than 5 guys and their insane prices!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I arrived near closing time and the speaker had apparently been left on in the drive thru, and I could hear employees saying 'go home, we don't want you here'. Things to that effect. I will never be back, unless I hear they have hired somebody besides these high school punks."}
{"text":"I first went to Freddy's for the custard. Being from St.louis and spoiled on Ted Drew's growing up I had to go to Freddy's and try it. The 2 times I went was real good, I give the custard 3.5 stars in the concrete and 4.5 in the sunday. Something gets lost in the concrete version of the custard, not as creamy and dense. 

I hadn't even looked at the burger menu. Until one day I had to try these \"steak burgers\". I took one bite and just like in the movie Ratatouille when the food critique guy ate the dish and was instantly transported to his childhood and it almost made him cry. Thats just about what happened to me. There is a place in STL called Carl's. And for 18 years I've been telling people \"I wish you could try a Carl's burger and taste the best burger ever.\" Now Freddy's is not exactly the same as Carl's, but it's about 90%. So It will have to do. I love Freddy's, every time I go I'll eat a single or a double burger then I have to get one more because it's just that good.
If by chance you get around to StL, look up Carl's and try."}
{"text":"This location on Gilbert and Baseline was absolutely disgusting. Tables poorly wiped down,trash full drink station a mess. Just generally filthy, burger was okay but it's hard to feel comfortable eating something when a dining area is in such poor shape. Will absolutely not return."}
{"text":"Their chicken strips are soooo good!!!! They usually have fundraisers for community members. The only thing I don't like it's that when the employees are having supervision they do it outside where the customers eat. So you can literally hear everything their boss is telling them! But besides that the good is very good and their custards too"}
{"text":"I am writing about the location on Williamsfield Rd, Gilbert.  The food and prices are so- so.  This last time we were there, I ordered chicken tenders (dry, overcooked and a very small portion at that) My fries were so salty I could hardly eat them \"and I like salty fries\".  My husband had their hot dog and it wasn't hot almost cool in the middle !!!  So not real sure what to make of it.

But to be fair, the service was GREAT the girl at the counter was very pleasant, and the ordered came correct...Just not real good."}
{"text":"Freddy's never disappoints. I always leave happy and full. Fry sauce and shoestring frys are a great combination."}
{"text":"Do not go to this location on your lunch break. I have been here twice in the last month and have waited in the drive-through line over 20 minutes each time. The food is good and hot but the wait time is horrible."}
{"text":"Good flavorful food but personally I didn't like it. I prefer burgers with some meat to them, the Freddy's burgers while taste good are just flat pancaked pieces of meat. Also I prefer steak fries, something can really eat and these fries are a joke, thinner than a pencil and they are broken into such small pieces that I might as well be using a spoon to eat them cause they would even fall through the prongs of a fork. The one plus was the custard, that I'd go back for!"}
{"text":"Really great burgers! Lobby and seating area was clean, employees were friendly, the shoestring French fries are on point as well. We really liked the fry sauce. The price is very reasonable also."}
{"text":"Good tasting but needs more steak on steak burger!  Needs, condiments on it also!.   Brownie sundae comes with chocolate Ice cream, would be so much better with vanilla, should have read the menu better. Disappointed, will try again some time & pay more attention.  The place was very clean, nice looking! All the employees were helpful & seem to do their jobs well."}
{"text":"Awesome frozen custard. Yes, it's different from and better than ice cream. :) Best peanut butter hot fudge shake you can get.  (half vanilla/half choc frozen custard) YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Tasty moist flavorful burgers. 

Wonderful thin crispy fries with minimal grease. 

We've been back several times and will keep returning.

Prices reasonable. 

Fast service, order takers know contents of menu items.  Appreciate this knowledge with having food allergies. Employee even cleared table of tray and baskets, nice touch.

Deserts look great, need to go just for desert, portions have been so good I don't get desert.

The only thing I would change is soda choice, personally prefer Coke to Pepsi."}
{"text":"I have been an a burger kick lately, so a couple of my partners-in-crime and I went on a burger crawl...Freddy's was our first stop. All I can say is WOW! I had the Triple Steakburger, fries and drink combo ($6.89.) The burger is a smash burger...the meat is smashed on the grill in to thin patties which get all crunchy on the outside. I ordered the burger with cheese, mustard and pickle. It was delicious! The fries are the tiny shoestring fries like Steak & Shake fries. They were hot, fresh, and amazing! They also have diet Dr. Pepper which in my opinion is a big plus.  

After devouring the burger and fries I ordered the Signature Turtle Sundae...vanilla custard, hot caramel, hot fudge, pecans, whipped cream, and a cherry. This sundae was absolutely amazing!!! The custard was dense and creamy and the toppings made me melt faster than the ice cream. Yummy stuff!

The employees were all friendly, cheerful, and efficient! The restaurant was very clean.  Thankfully for my waistline and circulatory system I live in a different state because If I lived nearby I would be eating here way to often."}
{"text":"I was certain I reviewed Freddy's already's but when I looked it wasn't there.

Freddy's has good fast food burgers, thin patties cooked hot and fast so that they carmelize slightly.

Pencil fries with cheese sauce are tasty, although the amount of cheese sauce varies wildly depending on where the moon is in relation to mercury and the various astrology signs.  This issue may have resolved itself with the advent of the new astrology sign.  As a matter of fact, this may have been the underlying cause for the creation of the astrology sign in the first place.

I don't pretend to understand the greater workings of this mysterious universe which revolves around me. I do know that things are more in harmony when I have the desired amount of cheese sauce on my fries."}
{"text":"Those who complain about the meat are right in that it's just a shaving of meat but has great flavor.  And who can say they don't have the best onion rings!  Wish there was a Freddy's closer than 25 miles from my house."}
{"text":"I like the place. It reminds me of something you would see back in the midwest. That said, it is still fast food. The burgers are decent, but a little on the salty side. They have the very thin patties you don't tend to see much any more--which I like for a change of pace. Their shoestring fries are also very good. 

Service is friendly, the place is clean and bright. No complaints, but nothing stands out as tremendous. Good for families with kids though."}
{"text":"Not my favorite style of food but I have nothing to complain about! I always get great service, food out in a short amout of time, employees will go above and beyond for their customers. They will customize any dessert or lunch order with no problem! Staff continously checks on you while you're eating to make sure all your needs are being met. Booths,tables, condiment table, bathrooms you name it! Always spotless! I  will always be a customer. Thank You Guys!"}
{"text":"Was just brought here for the first time by my in laws.  The food was awesome. As others have said it's not a traditional burger it's a thinner chip steak type party but great flavor.  The fry sauce is great as are the shoe string Frys.  They did mess up our order a bit but the manager fixed it right away and brought the order to our table apologized for the delay.   The Custard was awesome (brownie delight sundea)  great place I will be back with my family.  Great service is so hard to find!  But we found it here!!"}
{"text":"This review may just be a collection of tips, but suffice it to say that I am a fan. 

1. Get a double burger. They're thin and work much better in pairs. 
2. Save room for dessert. The custard is tasty
3. The fries are of the \"shoestring\" variety (thin) and are great with their fry sauce (in the pump machine by the soft drinks AND/OR with a bit of \"Freddy's Seasoning,\" a seasoned salt that you can get at the front counter.

My kids like the chicken strips, but I have decided that the \"California Burger\" is my favorite. Oh, unlike In-n-Out Burger, you can get your burger with BACON on it at Freddy's. 

The staff at this Freddy's have been friendly and nice -- and they welcome everyone that comes into the place.

...almost forgot... they have sweet tea, too"}
{"text":"Double steak burger is amazing. So so so good. The fries are amazing. Had a dirt Sunday & it was fantastic. Haven't been inside quite yet, I have only been through the drive thru. Just about tied with in n out as my favorite burger. Idk what they do to their food, but it's great:)))"}
{"text":"Good choice for an afternoon snack, just had the frozen custard, it hit the spot, and was just what we needed to pick us up.  Prices were reasonable and no one came make a Sunday the wrong way, right?

Not crowded, clean, good service.  Looking at the food coming out, might have to come back and try a burger!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Customer service is great here and food was good as well,  especially the French fries!"}
{"text":"This place was a little confusing for me.  There were no descriptions of the food so I was flying blind when I ordered the California burger.  I just assumed it would have something like avocado or ranch or fish or sunshine or eddie money....but it didn't.  Nothing California about this burger other than that's probably where the lettuce came from.  Speaking of lettuce, this burger had it with some uncooked onions and a tomato.  These aren't normally things I want on my burger but, apparently, that's what constitutes a California burger.  It was more expensive than a regular burger because of the toppings.  Nice.

Since I failed to realize any of this at the time, I was still pretty hungry when I finished.  Since this is a steak-burger place, they like to flatten out the beef until it looks like the sole of your shoe.  It's pretty thin and not very filling.  The taste is good and it's not greasy (unlike Steakenburger) but I really wished I had ordered a double.  

The fries were actually really good which made me really happy.  I ended up putting some on my burger just to try and give it some more substance.  Not bad.  Feels like I'm back in Pittsburgh.

Anyways, I probably wouldn't go back here but who knows?  It was better than Five Guys so they have that going for them.  It was a pretty ho-hum experience and that's probably what you'll get too."}
{"text":"Have loved going here ever since they opened! I love the fact they opened one up in Flagstaff a few years back too so when we go up there for camping, it's our pit stop before coming back down to the east valley. My ultimate fave to order is the #5 patty melt...divine! Crispy & toasted bread, caramelized onions & of course Freddy's famous steak burger. Dip that in some Freddy Sauce (it's kind of similar tasting to In-&-Out's Spread w/o the relish taste or maybe it's like a ketchup-mayo-ranch concoction?) & you are transported into yummy euphoria, lol! What I love also is their shoestring fries...can't get that anywhere else around, except when you buy them from the grocery store to cook @ home. Freddy's is generous with these. My hubby loves the burger & hot dog combo and you can customize these the way you want. My older boys love the double CA burger while my 2 youngest love the chicken tenders, breaded & crispy served with either bbq sauce or Ken's Ranch Dressing. Oh my! Did I forget the frozen custard? Doh! I did! Frozen. Creamy. Generous portions...so delish! The seasonal pumpkin pie with graham cracker pie crust chunks is out of this world; the tropical one with pineapples & toasted coconut is refreshing; the chocolate brownie delight is my go-to because it has creamy chocolate custard, moist brownie chunks, whipped cream, & chocolate fudge...ooooh. Great family place, great American family business, great service. Have I said enough? Maybe...maybe not enough!"}
{"text":"Nothing real exciting here, average burgers but better then any of the other fast food chains, ice cream is better then DQ. Would go there again if I was jn the mood for a fast buger and there wasnt a Culvers around, if you like Steak n Shake this would be a good replacement."}
{"text":"Stopped by last night for a last chance meal at something other than turkey for the next week and WOW fantastic!  First time there and was not disappointed.  Had the triple Freddy and it was flavorful and hot and fresh and the fries where fresh also nice twist on them to looked just like the potato sticks you get in the can but in french fry form and cudos for the dipping sauce for the fries also.  Even put  the sauce on my burger yum, yum!  I hope there is one of these on the west side of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Well after driving by many times and never stopping, we finally stopped today and it was crowded. We ordered a single steakburger and onion rings and a drink (Combo) and a chicago dog and a regular hot dog. Now off the bat this place kinda reminded me of Culver's with the Steakburger thing going on. I have to say it was tasty like Culver's, but we left still hungry, not many onion rings. The Chicago dog was great as I remember it from Chicago and my girlfriend enjoyed her hotdog and part of my hamburger (yeah, we were fighting over who is going to finish the last few bites, cause we were still hungry). We will try it again though as we always give places a few chances."}
{"text":"Freddy's is a good place to eat, when you hit them on the right night. We have been here 4 times in the past few months and it's either hit or miss. They always seem to pack the place, but that may be because of the price and the fact that we go on the weekend when there seems to be a car show taking place :)

Over all it's burgers and hot dogs. They are famous for their frozen custard which is awesome!

Last night the fries were very oily, I could actually see the wetness in them. They were good, but thinking about the oil was a tough one to swallow down.

I got a single burger plane with grilled onions last night, unfortunately not many onions :(

We will continue to go back, primarily because it's economical for a family of 4 and also the atmosphere is pretty neat."}
{"text":"I love this place! The burgers and custard are AMAZING. The food always tastes fresh and the prices are agreeable."}
{"text":"Great dogs, chili, fries..   Customer service is outstanding!!  Their steak burgers are also fantastic!!  5 stars for great food, fast service, and excellent customer service!!!  The staff here really makes this restaurant great!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat the food is good they have friendly and nice staff but if you are going through the drive-thru your going to be waiting awhile takes for ever to get your food.  Go in side to eat :)"}
{"text":"Steak burgers so flat and thin you can see right through. Bacon as flimsy a single-ply toilet paper. The bun was a soggy as New Orleans after hurricane Katrina.

I don't know how I feel about the abundance of onions on the Chile cheese fries either...maybe they just throw onions on everything excessively to mask the flavor, or lack their of the steak."}
{"text":"Holy amazeballs. This place is so freakin delicious, it should be illegal. I generally get the patty melt and it is just perfect. The patties are thin, but they are so flavorful that it doesn't matter. The rye is perfect as well. I am super picky, and my order is always done just as I order it. The service is awesome; really, really friendly staff and quality food... This place is hard to beat."}
{"text":"The burgers were great too bad that our orders were messed up. I also have to cut them a star because the Mountain Dew was out and they didn't have any to replace it with. I would gladly come back again I just hope my order is correct next time. They do give a military discount. I am giving an extra star because they're veteran friendly"}
{"text":"Freddy's was a pretty decent place for burgers and fries, but they fell a little short of being great for me.  The burgers tasted high quality but they were severely lacking in seasoning.  I loaded it up with salt and a bit of pepper and things were made better.  The fries are shoestring fries so they're nice and crisp.  I really enjoyed them, but again, lacking in seasoning.  Their prices are fair, especially considering the stupid 5 Guys is pretty close to them.  Just to compare, I had a comparable burger here plus fries AND a drink, all for the price of a single patty burger at 5 Guys.  I probably won't come back here mostly just because there are so many other similar places and this just doesn't stand out."}
{"text":"The shinning stars of this place is the custard and fries. The custard being the brighter star, creamy, sweet and flavorful. The fires are crispy and thin as well as great mode of transportation for the tasty fry sauce."}
