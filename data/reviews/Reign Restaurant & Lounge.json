{"text":"Must go! Attending Reign's restaurant private dinner prior to their grand opening and I had a phenomenal time. The customer service is on point. The ambiance and decor is modern and sophisticated. The food, man.. delicious! My favorite was the pork belly roll. They have this drink called Netflix and Chill which is a blend of Rumchata and Bailey. This place stays open late too so if you don't want the basic late night breakfast foods, come to Reign!"}
{"text":"Grand Opening is tonight. Their full menu is sushi. They have a good drink menu as well. Hookah and a DJ were in the atmosphere. I'm not sure if this will be every Friday night or what. The atmosphere is chill and lounge like. I had the shrimp Tempura Roll. The shrimp was fresh and of good quality. The staff is friendly and willing to help. Hope to see this place last."}
