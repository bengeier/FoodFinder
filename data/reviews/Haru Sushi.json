{"text":"Had lunch here couple of days ago. I think one of the best sushi places in Calgary. Service could be better. Our waitress had a tough time understanding what we wanted. However, when our meal came, we forgot about the poor service. Great sushi. Check them out."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, reasonable pricing and generally friendly staff.  They recently had a management change and the new male manager is not nearly as friendly or accommodating as the previous one (Claire). As a result we don't go there as often, however their unique and delicious rolls keep our business."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi spots in Calgary. I don't eat rice so I love the sashimi. Hamachi tuna is amazing. Also very good is teriyaki beef on a sizzling hot plate. Upscale and lots of parking. Also must try the avocado tempura."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner and all the staff seemed so inconvenienced to wait on us. We were never asked how our meal was tasting or no refills on drinks.  The basic waiting service was horrendous. The food was good and the design of the restaurant is cool but it's expensive and bad service. Overall, not a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time tonight. Very happy with the quality, presentation and professional service. Price point was reasonable. I will order again. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"If you plan to go for dinner on the weekend, take the time to make a reservation. Otherwise, you may be turned away.  We have been to this little place at least two dozen times. It has become our \"go to\" restaurant for sushi. We really appreciate the consistent quality of the food. I particularly like the creamy lemon prawns.  The prices are about what you would expect for a nice sushi restaurant.  The restaurant does close a bit earlier than some of the ones in trendier areas. More than once we have ended up staying past their closing time. (Oops!)  Sometimes, it helps to be extra-patient with the staff, some of whom are young people from Asia who seem to be learning English. That aside, the staff are gracious, attentive and efficient. I appreciate that they read the order back to you so you can confirm they got it right.  The decor is modern and it's always spotlessly clean. It can get a little loud at times, which is why we often opt for take-out."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars for this place - I consider it a high rating for a sushi place in Calgary  I'm always looking for a new sushi place to try out here. Haru is not an authentic Jap sushi restaurant but I go here for the special rolls. They do put a little too much rice in their rolls for my liking but one of my fav take out places to settle my cravings.   As for the freshness , I've had fresher ones in other cities but for Calgary, its not too bad. Stick to safe choices like salmon if you are going to go for sashimi - I wouldn't order uni in any sushi restaurants in Calgary anyways."}
{"text":"We've been here plenty of times over the past couple of years. Usually the rolls were good, with the Sushi being a bit simple and unadorned, but still good value.  However, tonight something usual was in one of the pieces my son had, and everything we had was either very poorly prepared, or in the case of the Aburi, blackened, instead of warmed.  Our waitress didn't want to hear our complaints, she simply brought the bill. We won't be back."}
{"text":"These guys cut sashimi like some of the better sushi restaurants in Montreal.  Prices are very reasonable with excellent delivery discounts.  This is now are favourite sushi delivery restaurant in Outremont/Mile end especially for the price."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere and aura this place has, it's quite romantic and cute. They have a cherry blossom tree, beautifully decorating the place. It's a very clean restaurant with very good service and attention.   Their sushi is freshly made and their tempura shrimp is a must try if you visit. Overall good prices for the quality and freshness of food along with good service. My go-to sushi place :) !"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out tonight and was not impressed. For $8 I thought the dynamite roll was going to be either huge or extremely tasty...it was neither. I ordered a California roll and dynamite roll to take home and eat. Once I was through the mediocre California roll I realized that the prawn in the dynamite roll was still clear and certainly undercooked. Normally that would gross me out but I have to be extra careful these days as I'm pregnant. When I called to tell them I didn't even get an apology, the man just asked if I would like to come pick up another one (I wasn't about to drive all the way back) or get a credit. I chose credit. I was hoping the credit would be right back on my credit card but of course they won't do that and instead it's just a credit for a dynamite roll the next time I order. Well, that sucks, because I won't be ordering from there again! For the price of their sushi I might as well go to a higher end restaurant where I will be guaranteed better food and customer service.  *side note - Haru is Korean owned and operated."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We come here at least once a month now and it was never disappointing. Strong recommend the creamy scallop on its own or in a roll. We always order the salmon and tuna"}
{"text":"Sashimi tasted fresh, appetizers were yummy, service was friendly. The restaurant is also a nice place to relax, good atmosphere and pretty decor. Would recommend if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Yay! Finally found some Montreal sushi that hits the mark on most points.  - Maki are well rolled - Food has been fresh every time I've eaten it - Delivery has special discounts and is just as good - Tried and tested by many friends and everyone had a positive thing to say - Affordable! - Good variety. Their fried spring rolls are actually quite good too though a bit odd to serve in a sushi restaurant. This is Montreal after all, though!  I'd love to see a few more options without tempura but other than that, pretty solid."}
{"text":"We have been going to Haru for a few years now and at first both the food and service were very good. Both started to decline but it was not that bad to change restaurant for. In the last 6-7 months, things have been going downhill fast! I tend to do take outs as well as dine in and the last few take outs have been really low on both quality and service. Every time I call, I have to make sure to ask for wasabi, soya, chopstick and repeat the order few times. Still there is always something wrong from wrong order to missing something. I took a picture of the spicy tuna crunch roll to see how uneven the rolls are. And the wasabi and ginger were missing. So done with this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great sushi. Excited to see a sushi restaurant provide alternatives to white rice and they even had GF soya sauce. Enjoyed their take and variations on the traditional rolls. Longing for LA sushi but for the burbs in Calgary .... Delish!"}
{"text":"Bright and clean, this neighbourhood restaurant is a fantastic place to grab a bite! Service is fantastic.  The menu has a great selection, and the food is consistently delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"I'm surprised why I even agreed to go to a sushi place like Haru Sushi. It's far from my usual area in Calgary. In fact the drive to Haru Sushi was tricky due to the construction occurring around Sarcee and Glenmore. Sure enough, I was lost and dangerously flipping through my gps in order to find the place.  When I finally arrived I realized I was a little late and it seemed everyone was already eating. I quickly picked through the menu and wrote down the following unique items:  Kabucha (sweet pumpkin) Tempura Cream of Edamame Seafood Soup Aburi Scallop Roll Sashimi/Sushi (Tamago, Tuna, Salmon, etc)  Recalling backwards, the sashimi and sushi were nice and fresh. I was quite impressed @ their Tamago and how well presented it was, it looked like a marbled cake which was effective and creating this see-saw effect of sweetness and saltiness as I ate it. Their Aburi Scallop Roll was impressive and was an intense experience to eat. The Scallop was lightly seared on top of a lotus root and inside were pieces of avocado and pineapple (WHAAAAT!?). I was particularly excited to try the Cream of Edamame Seafood soup and our whole table was also curious as no one has ever seen anything like it. For a cream soup, it was surprisingly light and the sweet/salty taste of edamame complimented the delicious seafood chunks. Finally, the Kabucha tempura was a great alternative to the usual yam tempura I've enjoyed, it was sweet but held a different firm texture.  Overall it was a great dining experience. However the downside was that the prices were really STEEP, almost in line with most downtown Calgary sushi joints. Still no complaints, its hard for a sushi restaurant to have a menu that sets itself apart and Haru sushi is certainly worth the cross-city trek to try such unique dishes."}
{"text":"Fait partie de nos sushis pour la livraison préférés: ils sont bons, ils sont beaux, il y a du classique et de l'original, bref, du bon choix et on aime ça!!"}
{"text":"Food is expensive for quantity, especially lunch specials.  Quality and flavors were good; service acceptable.  Hot foods came luke warm as servers left food to sit after it was put up by the kitchen.    As for the sushi, the rice was fresh, soft and well seasoned however the salmon was not properly trimmed with dark brown strip of flesh along the long edge of the sushi.  Very off putting; I should have sent it back.  What I HATE is that the restaurant puts their gratuity on the invoice but does not inform you.  They will hand you the machine to pay for your tab which requests another gratuity.  If I hadn't looked at the bill, I would have double tipped.    When I mentioned it to the waitress she faked not understanding what I was saying.  Funny how her English (literally NO accent) was perfect throughout ordering and our meal.    I always tip so I find this terribly offensive and consider this as a way to cheat their clientele.  (note: no indication on menu that gratuity would be included; we were a party of 2 -- not 8!).  Spoke to a lady on my way out who didn't notice the bill and she did tip twice.  So be aware -- they cheat their clients.     This restaurant has another sushi place in Cranston & another in the Southwest."}
{"text":"Good sushi and pretty good location. This restaurant has a very nice atmosphere with good sushi. The price is not the lowest but certainly possible to eat here on a budget. The rolls are very nicely made and Certainly an awesome place to visit if you're in the aspen/69th ave area"}
{"text":"This is a nicer sushi restaurant, so expect to wait a few minutes longer than you would at some of the less fancy sushi spots. That being said, worth the wait... The sushi rolls are very fresh and absolutely delicious!! The spicy crunch salmon roll and California rolls were particularly good.   Really nice, clean, tastefully decorated space.   I've also come here for their teriyaki lunch special which is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Haru Sushi was a success. Fresh sushi, professionally wrapped rolls, excellent service. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Becoming one of my preferred Calgary Sushi spots. The Nacho Cheese rolls are outstanding!"}
{"text":"A good and decent japenese restaurant, it's actually more classy than average and is located in a very non obvious location.   This place is kind of a hidden Gem, located right by a college and a big line of duplex housing, in a little outdoor mall complex. I came here with my cousin for a very delightful meal. He and I enjoyed every bite and the food had a very delicate nature to it, a sign of true japenese cuisine!  I have been to plenty of sushi places in my day, i consider myself an afficianado ! (second to my protege Angelo T of course). I have also been to Japan and tried the really good stuff! So how does haru place in my sushi history? Very well indeed! The sushi here was a strong 8/10, really good rice, really good fish ! Very well prepared and with very fresh ingriedients. Presented in absolute elegant simplicity!   The service was really good BUT since we came late they kind of suggested \"it's time to hit the road\" which we were going to do anyway, it's always a little annoying when places do that, especially with no warning...... The prices here are a little high to. considering its location probably not the smartest move but I have to admit the interior is rather swanky and suggest that it's expensive. I would easily come back here if I was in a spending mood. If you are a sushi freak I would reccomend you try this place out!"}
{"text":"Consistent and reliable! The rolls have always been fresh and they aren't overly stuffed with rice, which is great.  The price point is super reasonable. If you spend over a certain amount you get a bonus roll etc. Friendly and efficient service. This is my go-to neighborhood sushi joint."}
{"text":"While i've never been to the location physically and cant review the actual venue and in house staff themselves in terms of customer service etc , Haru is my absolute go-to when i'm ordering-in sushi and so i can definitely review their food !  They have such a great variety of rolls (some traditional and some more outside the box - so there's something for the adventurous and the conservative sushi fan!) , they always taste fresh and flavourful and at very reasonable prices with both discounts offered at times and a free sushi roll from the chef when you order over a certain amount which is a nice little touch. They always deliver on time (or early) and I haven't had any mistakes on my orders. I would recommend them to any sushi lover who doesn't want to break the bank in order to enjoy some quality rolls! I will definitely be ordering from here again and again :)"}
{"text":"2nd time there, drop the review down a star. Again, some of the fish wasn't so good to my taste buds. Got our order backwards. What I do like is the wide variety of interesting appetizers and dishes. Agedashi tofu is quite good there.  Kind staff, enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoy this place! It's interior is contemporary and the staff is friendly and efficient. I have only been here twice, but both times it has been a treat. Yesterday we had ordered about 8 dishes and they were all delicious! It literally only took about 5 minutes for them to start showing up at our table and I was so glad for that considering how hungry I was.   Everything tasted very fresh and I recommend you order the spicy tuna sashimi to start. It's amazing for those that love texture. It included the tuna, cherry tomatoes, a little bit of lettuce, slices of apples and little wonton crunches (or was it tempura) to put overtop the spicy sauce. Mmm.   If you are ever in the area, check it out!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for some great sushi near Aspen - fantastic roll combinations!. We were in a bit of a time crunch and the server was attentive and mindful of our time constraints and helpful with regard to recommendations."}
