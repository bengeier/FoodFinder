{"text":"It was tough for me to truly gauge how much I did and didn't like this restaurant. When we went it wasn't that busy. Having had Mandi in Dubai, Qatar I can honestly say that I didn't 100% love it. 

Pros:
1. Service was awesome 
2.It was decorated in a cute little way ( influences of Emirati, Egyptian and Moroccan hints)
3. A woman was making the food alone in the kitchen it had such a homey feel i loved this part. 

There really weren't too many cons except the food - it could have been better. My beef steak was hard to cut because it was very tough. We had never been there before so I wish the server gave a bit more information. 

I would visit again and try something different. I have it 3 stars because I'm not sure if I love it or hate it."}
{"text":"I've only visited this place twice and both times got great service... The servers were attentive and only came to assist us when needed, I hate feeling crowded or interrupted too much while dining.. they have a really nice cozy set up in the basement where you done on the floor on Arabian style cushions. There are prayer Mats on the other side where patrons can perform their prayer which must be a little of a distraction for them but the whole vibe is very quiet and serene.  We ordered the chicken stew on rice for first visit and it was so delicious, the serving portion looked like it wouldn't be enough but we had a hard time finishig our meals. The second visit I tried the goat meat, which was the best I've ever had hands down! I'll always come back just for the goat meat. Honestly. They nailed it with the seasonings and sauce, the meat is just so tender and juicy and made fresh to order.  The staff again were very polite and inviting."}
{"text":"Great ambience, good food, not so good value for money. Came here for iftar with my family only because it's closer to home than Almonasabah which is in Mississauga. Just want to say I'd rather go all the way to Almonasabah as the Mandi there is unbeatable in terms of aroma, taste and authenticity!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and rice dish.
Chicken was terrible. It felt like it was either over cooked or stale. The salt content in the chicken was over the top. Also they seem to have increased the price of almost all items and add to the fact that we took a subway to come to this place even though the restaurants near our apartment serves better food for cheaper price.
The server was rude and when we politely gave her the feedback, she cut as off and was like \"I will let the chef know\"...I mean let me atleast finish..It wasnt even like I was going on and on...I just said...The chicken was not the best...It had lot of salt..The goat meat was good though.

Would only come back for the goat meat."}
{"text":"Update:

Service staff has changed, their service is now much better than it used to be. There is no reason to not go this place now.

Food - Amazing, Service - not-so-amazing

Let me be clear that i really want you guys to try this restaurant. This is the best mandi I have had since i left middle-east.

Food:

I have had lamb and Chicken mandi here and the meat is very tender and juicy, you can tell it was made fresh. Unlike other places, they don't just give the same rice with every meat option, the rice is actually cooked with the kind of meat you're getting which gives it a very good taste.

One bowl of Soup and Salad are complementary with every meal, and their soup is soooooo goooooodddd, the only thing you would need on a chilly day. 

The tea is also complimentary and you can have as much as you want.

Ambiance:
It has a very middle-eastern vibe to it. If you sit in the basement or upstairs, they have this whole takht (ground sofas?) set up, where you can have your private gathering. You'd sit on the ground and eat, just like middle-east. Of course they do have tables as well, but if you're looking for an authentic experience, i'd suggest sitting on the ground and eat ;)
Perfect place for large groups!


Service:
Now this is where the place lacks a little. I think it will be best to describe their service as \"moody\". They will serve you and look after you if the place is busy and they are already in their working mode, but when there aren't many people, they will become super lazy.

It's safe to say that they don't really look after their customers properly. I have been to the place when it was busy and I had no complains, but the last time we went, we were the only people there.

The server took 10 minutes to come take our order, didn't bring water all, didn't check on us while we were eating to see if we needed anything (we did), didn't bring the bill.

Its like they almost forgot we were upstairs. They were just chilling by the counter listening to music.

TL;DR - go there, expect amazing food but don't be disappointed if you don't get good service."}
{"text":"The food are good but the service is not as good as the food.....I hope in the future they care with the customer and smile at least a bit lol....."}
{"text":"Awesome, quaint, and interesting place for Mandi. While not the best I've had, it's certainly a no frills and fun environment for Mandi in Toronto. 

The lamb is excellent, and chicken can be a bit dry. The lamb broth soup as part of the meal is just excellent. 

A must visit if you're in the area and are craving Mandi."}
