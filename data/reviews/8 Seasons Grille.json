{"text":"I have eaten at 8 Seasons Grille 3-4 times and each time it has been great. I love that the menu changes so frequently, but unlike other places in Madison you can generally still find the full correct current menu on their website.   They have a nice wine selection and we have found some of our favorite wines (like Apothic Winemaker's Red Blend) there. The food is also always great and inventive. Everything is fresh and delicious. We always order too much. One time they didn't have boxes and wrapped up my leftovers in foil. It worked out.  The most recent time we went there, we had cocktails rather than wine for the first time. The mojitos were good, but I wanted a ginger basil one and they were out of it. The Espresso Silk (martini-ish) was amazing. I had it for dessert. The desserts are AMAZING. They are all homemade and they are my husbands favorite. He has raved to the owner about them multiple times.   We have generaly used restaurant.com coupons when we've eaten at 8 Seasons. Without them, it is a bit pricey. But I am still surprised this place doesn't seem to be more popular. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of this place, but it's gone downhill since they remodeled and changed the concept to try to make it fancier. Still good for brunch, but that's where my recommendation stops. They're usually out of several things on the menu which means the already relatively small menu gets pretty limited. The portion sizes are not in line with the prices for the entrees, you can pay $27 and still leave hungry. The service is VERY hit or miss--some of them are great and some are just bad. Tonight our server was way too busy talking to his friends at the bar to notice that the one full table in the place had empty waters. Twice. I won't be back for dinner anytime soon."}
{"text":"There was nothing that this restaurant excelled in.  Unless you're looking for mediocrity.  We dined here on a recent Sunday night.  Our server was nice... but nice isn't enough.  He knew nothing about the menu--he could only tell us what the best-sellers were, not why they were any good.  I also stated at the beginning that I had a food allergy, and while the server was responsive at first, my entree arrived with a big helping of that allergen on top.    The food itself was salty--I guess, if you want food to taste good, just add a lot of salt.  Both entrees were not as described on the menu.  And finally, on our final bill, one food item rang up for an incorrect price. A $10.25 cocktail was split into three line items, which just plain seemed strange.  We won't be going back, as there are too many better dining choices in Madison."}
{"text":"If you're going to serve brunch on Saturdays, would it be too much to prepare in advance for orders of scrambled eggs, omelettes, coffee and toast? Apparently yes, at Eight Seasons. In fact, we concluded the name represents the expected wait time to be served your meal.   All this might be understandable if Eight Seasons served delicious food, but it was decidedly mediocre. In fact the eggs generally were lukewarm and the omelettes small and uninspired.   At Eight Seasons, not much comes to those who wait, and wait."}
{"text":"Our first visit we had a great dinner; I had a perfectly cooked ribeye, my wife loved the rosemary chicken. The chef had to apologize for neglecting an ingredient in our app...Service was great.  We went back a few weeks later, the service was great, they remembered us. However, as previous patrons have remarked, that doesn't save a restaurant, and it is nothing you can't make at home. The rosemary chicken wasn't marinated, too grilled, portion size was half... They were out of all beef, so i ordered grouper; it was alright and, an unreasonably priced portion. Our server wowed us with a free tiramisu...which was AMAZING!  We let the mishaps slide and gave them another chance. The third visit bombed with only three tables occupied! the app. shrimp skewers were undercooked and charred, probably frozen. My wife ordered a garlic stuffed fillet, there wasn't any garlic and the fillet was 70% raw! (My sister is a chef and taught me how to feel for medium rare, I regret not being more leery and fingering the food first.) Here is the dirt on the coffin: we fed part of a raw steak to our baby because the lighting was so dim. Even then we didn't want to complain because they are so nice. They gave us two free desserts for the raw steak, but creme brule was cold, and the cheesecake balls were frozen and dry....we are sorry, but free desert didn't unmake us freak for 24 hours wondering what raw bovine does to our 12 month old! I hope my wife doesn't have worms. Neither does the comment \"it will be great with eggs for breakfast tomorrow!\" We are not going back. I agree it was like \"Kitchen Nightmares,\"  I can see Ramsey screaming RAW!"}
{"text":"We have really enjoyed 8 seasons in the four visits we have made. This Sunday we had brunch. My partner's Ratatouille was delicious. I had my doubts, being that it really isn't the season for eggplants and most ratatouille ingredients, but they Winterized it nicely making it more of a wintery stew with roasted carrots and depth of flavor.   The American fries and Bloody Mary were rather ordinary but satisfied a craving.  I expected potatoes to be nicely seasoned wedges, but instead they seemed to be those pre-diced food service potatoes without much seasoning at all. Nothing special, but they helped potato cravings on a cold day, and sriracha hot sauce was available. Bloody Marys were made from an ordinary mix but was seasoned nicely by our waiter with horseradish. My Chilaquiles were awesome, but I knew that already (second time ordering them - nice comfort food).  We took a slice of carrot cheesecake home.  They always have tasty interesting dessert.   Not a crazy huge brunch crowd or any wait for tables.. yet.  I hope more people discover this place. Also, each time we visit, they have the kindest staff who are always enjoying themselves, fun and welcoming.  Go.  I regret not reviewing when we had dinner there a few weeks back.  Now I don't remember enough details, but it was an incredible meal."}
{"text":"we dined there on a recent friday night.  Our relatively simple order took about an hour.  There was never an explanation provided as to why the meals were taking so long.  ALSO, just outside the main door and among all of the outdoor dining tables were about 15 cigarette butts.  Not too appetizing.  clean it up!  and don't let your staff smoke in front of the door.   We enjoy the food, but it can't take an hour to prepare a salad and pork schnitzel."}
{"text":"Saturday evening we thought dinner at 8 Seasons Grill would be a fun experience...As usual, we were greeted by friendly staff, who immediately took our drink and appetizer order.  The salmon patties were exquisite!  Best I have EVER had.  The yogurt sauce was amazing.  This was followed by the grilled chicken with risotto side.  Yummy!  We decided to order the dessert sampler, as we could not decide which of the elegant choices were best.  Our vote was the chocolate crusted strawberry cheesecake...a real winner, with close follow-ups by the chocolate cake, mouse pie, apple pie, and red velvet cake.  The intimate dining experience is always a treat."}
{"text":"Prices, food, staff, drinks... all exceptional. Stop in for a latte and a scone or a great dinner. This place is truly great."}
{"text":"I went here with my fiancee only because we had a coupon to be honest.   I was pleasantly surprised!  The food was really good.  The server was kind of goofy but really nice.  I had a porkchop and he had fried chicken.  I only docked a point because the location and atmosphere have room for improvement."}
{"text":"Searching for a place near downtown Madison that was close to my hotel. Found a small place that was a cross between a coffee bar and a bistro that really took me by surprise. Great service, wonderfully prepared food. Orange Roughy with an orange salsa, mixed veggies, jasmine rice and roasted red pepper soup. Each individual flavor of each ingredient was identifiable. Not a single flavor was lost in the shuffle. Perfectly prepared and balanced meal and the perfect size serving of each. The roasted red pepper soup is not for the faint hearted. It will set your taste buds ablaze. If flavor and heat is to your liking this soup is what you want.  Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a quality dinner there and I had the Sweet Potato Gnocchi and she had the Moroccan Chicken.  Both Dishes were good and a unique combination of flavors.  My only critique was that my dish was a bit too sweet but it's to be expected with what I ordered.  We also had a graham cracker cake which was also good, but a little dry toward the crust.  Bottom line was that it was a quality meal and we will be back to see what they have when they change the menu (8 times a year)"}
{"text":"This is the greatest addition to the Basset St neighborhood... fantastic service, great food, locally owned, awesome prices, nice atmosphere...I can't say enough. They change the menu 2 times a season, hence the name. The entrees and breakfasts are great. You don't get cheesecake factory sized portions, but you definitely get a good value. They have a great selection of teas,  and offer a full coffee and regular bar. Two brothers own it and you can tell they care about their customers a lot. Get on their mailing list too, they only email once a month and have good specials."}
{"text":"Oh, why do I keep coming back here? I know it's close, but it's really just not that good. I still think it tastes like food I can easily cook myself but I'm downgrading a star because the service is sooooo slow...At least when I'm cooking for myself I can clear my dishes as fast as I want. This place would be a great candidate for the TV show that pimps out sad, sorry places and makes them cool again."}
{"text":"Very welcoming staff; you'll feel like a regular in no time.  Really solid food, nice brunch scene."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Eght Seasons at least six times in the last few months.   Excellent quality food at reasonable prices, interesting menu, fresh flowers always on the tables and friendly attentive service.  Neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and we used to go every weekend for brunch. However, recently they closed for a few weeks for retraining and every time we've been back the experience has gotten worse.  Each visit they have been out of key ingredients (salsa for breakfast burrito, no veggies for the veggie risotto that they forgot to tell us about, desserts listed incorrectly on their board/menu.  The price is generally good but the portion sizes are small. The menu has been downsized but the quality has not improved.  The good? Unlimited mimosas on weekends until 3."}
{"text":"I am not going to lie, half the reason I love this place is because I love the people.  I love the story and I love that they are proud of it.  The owners, are so welcoming, but in a way that makes you believe they are in it because they love it, not just the money.   What I love about this place is it's atmosphere, the people.  It's like a restaurant that serves fine food and the \"cheers\" bar all at the same time.    Now to actually get to the food.  It's always presented fantastically, which I am finding is surprising important to me.  The soups are great and I really enjoy the sandwiches.  The food is always good, although I would say if they had any room for improvement it would be to more carefully describe the entrees on the menu, I am always a little surprised but what actually comes out.   Finally, what is really cool about this place is they are open to hosting events and parties.  They are flexible.  They also host their own event which is a spin off of the show IRON CHEF.  I missed the last one by a few minutes but what I could see at the end was really fun!  Give this place a shot, there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Took my brother and boyfriend here for lunch.  They both ordered 8 Seasons Burgers with bacon and cheese, while I ordered a BLT with salmon. Service was prompt and cheerful and we received our food quickly. The food was pleasantly arranged and looked amazing; appearance and display was thoroughly appreciated   My BLT came on four slices of perfectly toasted french roll.  Garlic aoli was paired well with the salmon, crisp lettuce and tomato, and bacon that seemed to melt in my mouth.  The side salad was fresh, delicious mixed greens, and the pistachio dressing was a perfect garnish-not overwhelming.  My boyfriends' allegiance to previous burger favorite on the square no longer holds.  He loved the taste and texture of the bread, not too dense, just sturdy enough, that worked to accent the burger patty rather than engulf it.  He said that the burger was cooked to perfection, medium, and \"tasted like a burger ought to taste.\"  My brother said the burger was the most amazing burger he'd ever had.  Lettuce, tomato, were fresh and crisp, and the garlic aoli was excellent.  Both burgers came with mixed greens salads which were quickly devoured.  The dessert was not quite as pleasing to the palate as it was stunning to the eyes.  We got a strawberry-blackberry cheesecake, and while the texture and balance of the cheesecake was good, the berry flavor was decidedly absent.  Even the chocolate dipped strawberry on top was underwhelming.  That being said, the ambiance, service and prices were excellent.  We will be back again, and look forward to further iterations of the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  I went there several times because it was a few blocks from my house.  The location is unfortunate, because I don't think they get as much business as they could.  Still, we thought it was nice to have a new restaurant like 8 Seasons in the Bassett neighborhood.    The food is ok, but a bit too pricy for what it is.  Mostly what kept us from going back was the server - twice when we went she sat down at our table while we ordered, expressing that she was tired, and once telling us her life story.  I am all for a casual atmosphere, but her behavior seemed a bit unprofessional.    I recommend the soups... and the wine.  Also, their outside seating area was nice."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, and the service even better. Katelyn was our server, and she recommended the chicken Marsala. It was absolutely delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was the perfect flavor. The bed of wild rice it was on was just creamy enough to satisfy the palate.   My wife's pork schnitzel was juicy, flavorful, and a perfect thickness. It was amazing how the mushroom cream sauce that covered it was reminiscent of red cabbage, even though red cabbage was not at all present.  For dessert, we split the only dessert offered: vanilla ice cream covered in cranberry drizzle, served with house-baked shortbread. Perfect finish to a great meal."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, but the food was only ok.  I had half of the Risotto and half of the Chicken Marsala, and both failed to wow me.  I ended up dousing each with salt and pepper, which improved the dishes slightly.  I also split the wontons with my table as an appetizer and they were over fried and the lemon aioli didn't quite mesh well with the flavors of the wonton.  The dessert, Chocolate Mousse Cake, was great though.  I would definitely be up for giving this restaurant a second shot though (after they change their menu up for the next season), because I did really like the atmosphere and the staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Food is usually a hit or miss. I've had an amazing chipotle sausage Benedict once but every other time  I ate there I was not impressed. They do have an amazing deal for brunch though $8 for unlimited mimosas"}
{"text":"For some reason, I came into this place with low expectations. Maybe it was the location that I just didn't love.  When I came out of it - I changed my mind. The food was really good, the menu fairly interesting, and the prices extremely fair. The staff even goes out of your way to accommodate substitutions and make you feel like home.   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic cozy atmosphere. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. The food is out of this world. I would highly recommend the three mushroom pasta- to die for!"}
{"text":"Great staff though portion size for dinner  beyond tiny  One chicken  breast  with  some small vegetables  16 dollars! No  pasta  or  starch included  Great  concept  but   was so hungry after leaving"}
{"text":"First time eating here. I had the BLT, it was fantastic. The waffle fries were also very good. Service was quick and polite. Albeit a tad clueless. I had to ask for some basic things like ketchup with my fries, and a set of silverware to stir my coffee with when I received it. This could have been because I say at the bar, and not a table. If the service had been on point I could have given 4 stars. If you are ok with asking for what you need, then this is a great place to eat. Apparently they were nearly out of coffee when I arrived at noon on Sunday, and started out the day without orange juice. For a place that serves unlimited mimosas until 3pm on the weekends, all of the problems above smell of bad management; Not incapable employees. At the end of the day the staff meant well, and the food was fantastic. I will come back."}
{"text":"I have only been here for lunch, but have been super impressed with their options. Their lunches seem well priced with other places in the area. My favorite meal there is the pulled pork on their pretzel bun! They also change their menu up so it always seems like there is something new to try!"}
{"text":"Solid place, somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but I'll round up. The food was good but not at the level of Madison's best. The waitress was nice and the chef got things out in good time considering he was working by himself. They were out of a few things and only one dessert, kind of a bummer.   I think this place is a good back-up for when everywhere seems to have an hour wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a different restaurant from our usual suspects and had a coupon for 8 Seasons. We were a little surprised by the location--not bad, just not where you'd expect a restaurant. Parking is a little tricky, but we found a place on the street.  We thought it would probably be an okay-but-not-stellar garden cafe. We were pleasantly surprised by a creative and varied menu with reasonable prices. The service (Kelly) was excellent and friendly. The chef (Nick) came out to ask about our preferences on preparation and if we would like linguine with our seafood scampi.  Everything was great. The salads were served promptly and with an excellent house dressing (pistachio vinaigrette) Kelly recommended. The seafood scampi was delicious. The shrimp was a tiny bit tough--but I'll attribute that to the fact that we're in Wisconsin and not on the Gulf or the Cape. Even the inexpensive wine was quite good--and nice pours.  We really loved this place and the people who run it--& will definitely be back. The only reason I'm not giving it the full 5 stars is the parking & the really-good-but-slightly-imperfect shrimp."}
{"text":"After taking a couple months off this place due to my last experience, I decided to stop being an ass and go back.  I really like the owner, and the food is still good, so all is well in the world.  And it just felt wrong having a review of the day be updated to a one star.  =X"}
{"text":"Good foods! Went for a brunch and had a pretty great sandwich. Usually less packed and busy than some other brunch locations, but just as good.  The most important part... Bottomless mimosas!! So worth it I've had good experiences with the service as well."}
{"text":"I've come back a few times hoping the last visit had been a fluke but so far haven't had a great experience here. The food is average or below average. Didn't love the huevos rancheros, chilaquiles or breakfast sandwich. The jalepeno eggs Benedict that has been a special a few times is very good.  I find the portions to be pretty small for the price. The menu has also gotten smaller since I started going.   Also, considering nobody is ever there, the service is pretty slow."}
{"text":"I went to this place a few month ago and kept forgetting to write a review. Finally got around to it and was kind of surprised by their current score. Not that it's bad....I just expected it to be higher. Unless something drastic has happened in the past few months...  My husband and I went here for an early dinner and we still talk about the meal we had. We shared a pork tenderloin dish that had a peppercorn sauce. It was definitely one of the top 5 dishes I have ever had in my life. I regularly check their menu because they change it 8 times per year (hence the name).  Anxious to revisit it and see if the experience is still positive...if not, I'll update my score."}
{"text":"An update: the coffee here is TERRIBLE. Always. The espresso drinks have been fine (with sugar) but the coffee always has a sour and/or burnt taste to it. I mentioned it in my past review, but it really needs to be emphasized again, haha. We forgot about the coffee, and ordered it again to go last month. The waitress didn't give us a lot of room for milk, which is usually fine, but it was like drinking sour patch kid sludge for the ride (we were headed to House on the Rock for the day). And it cost us $5 for the two coffees! We tried one more time this morning, and even asked for a freshly brewed pot, but something was still off like the beans themselves are stale. Blech.   All in all, my opinion of this place has morphed into the food is good so that keeps us coming back. I really hope they pay the female chef who works mornings/afternoons on the weekends VERY WELL. Service has always been spotty, coffee pretty much bad, and the menus need a lot of editing, but her cooking is always spot-on.  Also, a last pro is that they seem to be expanding their vegetarian options which is quite nice. I also liked the new tapas options, though a few things looked vegetarian but weren't marked with a V, so I wasn't sure how much I could actually eat."}
{"text":"Amazing. Food is phenomenal and I love how the menu changes 8 times a year to stay fresh and seasonal. The staff is friendly and they always remember the locals, which gives it a wonderful neighborhood feel. The prices are SO reasonable for such good food and drink. It makes a night out to dinner much more enjoyable to know I'm not spending $30 on a meh entree. Also, their patio is lovely in the summer. All in all, one of my favorite spots in Madison."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my friends tonight! We ordered soup, gnocchi and scallops and everything was excelent!  Super cozy atmosphere! Big selection of different teas - definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"We gave this place a try for breakfast and dinner, and were disappointed both times. The breakfast experience was terrible- extremely slow service, ran out of coffee, food came out wrong, took 10 minutes to get hot sauce while over cooked eggs got cold. Food was way over priced, especially for dinner."}
{"text":"Great and friendly atmosphere. Seasonal and regional menu; very accommodating. Open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I got to meet the 2 owners; brothers, who are very friendly. Menu changes 8 times a year. With time, this will easily be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Having been this place several times, it was always serving us good food and the service was pretty sweet. I love local food and this one is for sure one of those. The menu is neat and clean and the dish usually exceeds my expectation. The only thing they can do a better job probably is the coffee, huh..."}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch with some friends.  Though the place was empty, we had a great time.  The staff were very friendly and cool.  The menu is pretty short and sweet, except for the tea list, which is substantial.  Our food came out fast, and was very good.  I had the cheesesteak, which was very good.  Nice quality steak, great bun, perfect amount of peppers and cheese.  Came with a nice little side salad. Highly recommend the Eight Seasons as a very solid place to eat and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"To summarize: upscale menu, cheesy 80's music, TV in the bar, hit or miss food, friendly but terrible service = doesn't work.  There were four of us, and we all ordered a salad course and an entree.  After we ordered the chef came out (he was very nice) and said: \"I don't feel good about serving you the romain lettuce.  Can I use iceberg for the Caesar salad instead? And also, we don't have any fresh produce or potatoes today, so I'd be happy to make you something else instead\"  We all replied... ahhhhh... Okay? Sure? Make us whatever is good?  He was very polite and nice about it, but honestly, no produce or vegetables?  He said his truck didn't come in, which I understand happens from time to time, but if you're about to start dinner service and you don't have lettuce or potatoes, you go to the store down the street and you buy some lettuce and potatoes.    So that happened, but I kept and open mind.  Then our salads came out--the iceberg lettuce caesar salads (with no cheese, no anchovies, no cracked pepper) were horrible.  The wedge salad came with no dressing, (oops) I tasted it and thought, i could have made a better salad at my College cafeteria.    So I thought, whatever, the salads suck, you're out of lettuce, who cares, hopefully the food will be good.  1 out of 4.  The Veal scallopini was delicious.  It was rich, cooked nicely and tasted great with the mushrooms.  The rest of the entrees were a huge bummer.  Two steaks were overcooked, but weren't horrible.  The mahi mahi was burnt and overcooked, and the mashed potatoes had the consistency of tooth paste and tasted like they came from a box.    All in all, I felt like I was in an episode of Kitchen nightmares.  I feel like the chef had a lot of heart, and the server was really nice and friendly, but you can't run a restaurant on sunshine and happy thoughts alone.  You need things like fresh, well cooked food, good service, and ambiance.  Maybe my expectations were just too high for the little restaurant?  I don't know, but fundamentally, I think they are seriously lacking on all the things that make a restaurant good."}
{"text":"The lobster pasta is fantastic and just the right amount of food.  I recommend going here.  Also all of their desserts are made from scratch."}
{"text":"I went to Eight Season Grille based only on the fact that I had a coupon and was really pleasantly surprised.  I think the location is a little strange and that's why people don't really go there.  We had the porkchop and the fried chicken along with a few drinks and dessert.  Everything was excellent and the prices are reasonable.  The waiter was really nice too and did a great job.  I recommend it if you're looking for a low key place to have a really decent meal for a good price."}
