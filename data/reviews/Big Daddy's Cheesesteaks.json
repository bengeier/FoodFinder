{"text":"This a simple, no frills joint when you want a great cheesesteak. The staff is extremely friendly and nice.   Don't forget to add a fried egg, ya Dingus!"}
{"text":"My expectations were unreasonably high.  We had been trying to get food from this place for almost two months.  The first time we went there they were closed- okay so they aren't open after 3 on Mondays.  Any other time it would cross our minds they weren't open then either.  Then we tried to collaborate with the hours they were open and the owner was on vacation for two weeks, so the place was closed.  By this time I was convinced I would never try these cheesesteaks that were so renowned.  To make a long story short (too late) when we were finally able to sample this place's wares we shared a cheesesteak and a Rueben.  My thoughts on the aforesaid:  Cheesesteak was what a school cafeteria would make- cheese whiz and steak ums.  If that's what you want in a cheesesteak then that's cool.  I just expected something a little less processed.  The rye on the Rueben was so stale it broke into pieces when I bit into it.  Corned beef had that very distinct flavor that can only come with age.  I guess I'd give this place one more try, but my search for a great cheesesteak continues."}
{"text":"Where to go if you want an amazing cheesesteak or the best pulled pork around. Go to Big Daddy's!  The bread was so fresh, had the Carolina BBQ pulled pork 1 of 3 varieties and I was thrilled with my selection. Also had a few bites of the lone star cheesesteak another winner. Looking at the menu I am certain to come back to try everything. Great food, great service, cozy and clean. Its a throwback sandwich shop and i am obviously in love!"}
{"text":"Great cheese steak, the cheese is absolutely amazing. The home style fries have a little sweetness to them. They don't have a combo or a lunch special but it's still a great deal. There is talk of a sunday brunch which would be amazing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.

  Nice little diner vibe. Waitresses were very nice both times I went. The first time I was there the owner, a big friendly guy (hence the name Big Daddy, undoubtedly) came out to personally introduce himself and see how we liked our cheesesteaks, which was a really nice personal touch. We loved the sandwiches, by the way. Big enough to fill up on. Add a fried egg and a side of gravy if you really want the full effect. Good hearty sides (I have tried the potato salad and the coleslaw).

   I want to try everything on their menu...it all looks so good. But the average person would probably have only room for one cheese steak here at a time. Baby steps.

   The cheesesteaks here aren't so big that it would be impossible to finish one. In fact I think I finished mine every time I've been there. But you will leave full. I think I actually managed to cram in dessert here once, but I probably should have stopped after the main course on account of the fullness factor.

   Great service, great value.An excellent little diner with a creative, varied menu."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's is the only restaurant that I've been to that I've gone back the next day for more of the same.  Without hyperbole, I can confidently state that The Clevelander is one of the top 3 sandwiches I've had in my life.  I can't say how the other offerings are, I've never felt the need to deviate, as I find it hard to believe that anything else can even come close to the multi-sensory extravaganza of meat, cheese, bread, and gravy."}
{"text":"I am so glad that this place came into the area.  Stopped by for lunch today and I am really glad that I did.  I got the Cleveland Cheese steak and really enjoyed it.  Nice to see portabella mushrooms used on a cheese steak.  I think that I am going to have to try out the rest of the menu.  

I was really impressed with the service.  The girl running the front was sugary sweet and was really prompt in taking my order.  I was in and out in about 10 mins.

The only complaint that I have was that the slaw was not dressed enough for me.  Other than that it was really really good......"}
{"text":"After reading the many reviews for this place, I decided to give it a try. Anxious for the prospect of finally finding a decent cheesesteak in Cleveland, my son and I were the first ones in when they opened up.  We were greeted kindly as we sat down and promptly waited on. 

I ordered the \"Cleveland\" cheesesteak with horseradish slaw and my son got the \"Big Easy\" Cajun cheesesteak with potato salad. While waiting for our order, the lady behind the counter chatted with us and was very friendly.  Our order arrived hot and fresh in no time.

Both sandwiches were piled high with beef and all the fixins. The bread was fresher than anything I've EVER had in any restaurant.,  The sandwiches were nothing short of amazing! The beef was so tender and flavorful. The cheese sauce was very good, as were the portobella mushrooms and caramelized onions. The coleslaw was crisp, not swimming in dressing...just like I like it. The potato salad was fresh and delicious also.

I'm so glad we stopped in and will be back often!! I have been disappointed by every other cheesesteak in Cleveland, but have finally found a winner! Thanks for a perfect lunch."}
{"text":"Just had an original at Big Daddy's Cheesesteaks.....delicious. Almost as good as Geno's in Philly (and yes, Geno's is better than Pat's).

Soft bread, tender steak and very good cheese sauce. Stop by and give them a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Just go. Very, very good sandwich. I couldn't make up my mind. Cheesesteak or BBQ pork. Got both because I had to try them. Clevelander and sweet BBQ pork. I liked the cheesesteak better but both were excellent. The secret to a good sandwich is mastering the delicate ratio between bread, meat, toppings and sauce/dressing. They are masters!! The bread (I had white) is soft, chewy and delicious. The meat, toppings and sauce were perfectly proportioned for the bread - not too much nor too little. Potato salad - good. Service - friendly and efficient. FYI - the BBQ pork, though very good, is not true BBQ (smoke ring, bark, etc)."}
{"text":"Dear Vera.....before writing a review, please know what you are reviewing.  Philly cheesesteaks have.....ready for this......cheezwhiz!  And steakums?  Guess you are used to eating dog food, so these cheesesteaks are so above you."}
{"text":"Holy mother of cheesesteaks!!!! This place is amazing. Me and the bf went here for lunch recently. I ordered the Cleveland cheesesteak- steak, grilled onions, peppers, and delicious cheese sauce. (comes with shrooms, but I don't do shrooms). Also comes with a side of brown gravy and I opted for the dill redskin potato salad, though you can choose from several slaws. This sandwich was freakin awesome!!!! The cheese sauce oh.my.god. Delicious. And I could eat pretty much anything if it had that gravy on it. Don't be fooled though, the potato salad was also delish!

The bf got the Lonestar cheesesteak-steak, BBQ sauce, bacon, onions, peppers, and cheddar. He devoured it, only stopping to say how incredible it was. He also ordered the redskin home fries, and dunked them in the housemade chipotle ketchup.

If you're looking for a PHENOMENAL sandwich, come here. You will NOT be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch toady. The place is very small with a lunch counter.
The Cleveland cheese steak was wonderful! I love the fact that they put the yellow cheese Whiz on the sandwich like they do in Philly. I usually like all natural, but it works! The potato salad with dill was a nice touch. The coleslaw with horseradish was great, not drowning in Mayo.
The bread was very fresh. My son had the BBQ cheddar and he finished it before I started eating. 
I love the fact that the menu is the chalk board above the counter.

Keep it simple. Keep it fresh. You can't go wrong with Big Daddy's.
I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot that deserves more credit!  It is hidden in kamms corner, no sign outside or anything.

Inside though are some of the best cheesesteaks ever! They use great flavors in cooking and have some really amazing combos!  I love the cajun cheesesteak with the side of cajun slaw. Delicious!

Great that they are open realllly late too!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the service- very friendly
Layout nice for adults- tasteful reno of an old fashioned diner.
But, wouldn't bring my toddler here as there would not be a suitable seat in the house (built-in stools or high tops only).

But the real story is the food, right?
I loved my dinner- special of the day: BBQ Cajun Cheesesteak.  Tasty, cheesey, fresh bread.  A winner.  

Not a winner- the Corned Beef Reuben.  Fell flat---too little meat.  As my hubby/corned beef critic (a Slyman's v. Goodmans guy) put it, felt like an obligatory after thought.  Too bad.  Would go back for the Cheesesteak, though after he ate 2/3 of mine!"}
{"text":"Quality is what makes this a place to go. The menu is limited but what they have will not disappoint. Quality ingredients and service."}
{"text":"love the local cheese steak spot!!!!  the meat is super tender and flavorful.  for a saturday lunch i had 1/2 sammy  and a cup of chicken something soup, which was creamy and tasty.  i love sitting at the counter with the other patron's."}
{"text":"What can really be bad about the combination of steak, cheese sauce and bread? 

The answer is nothing. Some people just do it better than others, and let me tell you, Big Daddy's does 'em good. Real good. 

I've only had one experience here and it was so busy that the service actually wasn't that great. But hey, when you're popular you can't help getting rushed by lots of hungry folks. It's not that anyone was mean, it was just really slow. Understandable though. 

Anyways, it was totally worth the wait. Tender steak, warm and tangy cheese sauce and a fresh roll. When you're holding one of these guys you know life is good. 

Now, I'll be the first to tell you that I'm a cheese sauce kinda gal when it comes to my cheesesteaks. Some people love the melted provolone and that's cool. It still tastes good. But I'd be that person arguing with the people in Philly about this very controversial topic. 

Bottomline, get yourself a Big Daddy's Cheesesteak. What's great about them is that they're so simple, delicious and fresh. You don't need much more explanation than that... or at least I don't."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak fans look no further!  Like the name implies, that's pretty much all these guys do, and they do it very, very well.  Just to get it out of the way early: They use cheese sauce.  I like my cheesesteak either way, but I understand there's some bad blood between the Sliced Provolone and Cheese Sauce camps.  

If you're okay with the cheese issue, this is a place you need to check out.  I'm going to assume you're familiar with the standard cheesesteak formula, but where these guys really stand out are their variations.  The Seoul Man (Korean BBQ cheesesteak) and the Lone Star (I might be getting the name wrong, but it's the BBQ/bacon one) are phenomenal.  The home fries, coleslaw, and potato salad are also winners.  

Totally unpretentious and incredibly tasty.  I've never been to Philly so I can't speak to the official authenticity, but these are more than good enough for me."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to say how awesome this place is. The potato salad alone is worth coming here, let alone the freshly-prepared sandwiches and tasty goodness."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck, but don't blink or you may miss this quaint little hole in the wall.

 The first thing to keep in mid is that they close at 7 pm, so call in your orders early folks.

 I called and asked for their staple sandwich, which is the Cleveland Cheese Steak, which I ordered on the spot. I got a huge half order of the red potatoes and a side of the dill seasoned potato salad . The cheesesteak was served the God intended  it, with a thick layer of cheese wiz, delicious thick sliced marinated streak, sautéed peppers, onions, and giant sliced portobello mushrooms. Comes with a side of anjou.... I mean who doesn't like poring gravy on a beef sandwich? Oh and by the way all that was  $8.50. Filling 2 full takeout boxes. 

Definitely worth a lunch run, or a take out order after work. Keep up the good work back there big daddy!"}
{"text":"Great staff.  Great food.  The Cheesesteaks are definitely something to write home about.  The Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich is pretty amazing too.  Not to mention their cheese cakes!  They offer a daily homemade cheesecake.  I've had their Lemon Blueberry and their Caramel Apple cheesecakes.  They were both absolutely amazing!  Big Daddy's also features a brunch on Sunday.  I've had their home made waffles and delicious home fries.  They also have your choice of sausage or chorizo gravy.  Both are pretty amazing.  Big Daddy's is a great addition to Kamm's.   You're an idiot if you don't try this place!"}
{"text":"What an awesome little unassuming place. Went here for lunch on a rare warm Saturday afternoon in January with a couple friends, who recommended the place. Service is fast and nice, and cheesesteaks were ready in around 10 minutes or so. Aaaaand they are delicious as hell. I could have eaten the bread alone for lunch -- I have no idea if they bake it themselves or buy it from someplace, but it is the jam. Portions are crazy huge, except for the tiny side of potato salad (which is still delicious -- I just wish there would have been more of it). Whatever other reviewer said, \"Ew, this is like Cheez Whiz\" -- uh, have you actually ever been to Philadelphia? Because that is exactly what they use. And if you can't handle that once in a while, that just means more cheesesteaks for me."}
{"text":"Today after landing in Cleveland with a bit of starvation going on I trusted my Yelp ap to get me to food. I am not sure that there has been a time where I was more grateful to have Yelp reviews in the palm of my hand. The Cheesesteaks, soup and fries were fantastic. The gentleman next to us had the Pulled Pork and claimed it was the best sandwich he had ever had.

Friendly staff, great food and good prices makes this a place not to be missed."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and even better food! In what's quickly becoming ohio's best bar strip (kamms corner) you can't go wrong with stopping in to Big Daddy's Cheesesteaks. The coleslaw and home fries are fantastic and a great side to go along with healthy sized cheesesteak or pulled pork. Cleveland's best kept secret."}
{"text":"It was yummy, service was friendly and I like the old school lunch counter feel."}
{"text":"Never had anything but a chain-store cheesesteak, so I thoroughly enjoyed BD's classic. Fresh, chewy roll, nicely seasoned beef w/ a little bit of grill char. Con:the yellow cheese sauce reminded me of the stuff they put on nachos at the stadium. Side of hash browns was great w/ unique cajun seasonings. Place was filled w/ loyal customers when I went. Staff very friendly. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The \"Cleveland\" cheesesteak is great, a heap of perfectly cooked beef with the requisite cheezish substance, mushrooms, onions and peppers (which I passed on). The gravy alone is worth making the trip, (ask for extra!). The bread is so fresh I was surprised that it wasn't baked in-house.

The home fries and potato salad are great accompaniments, especially when you dip the fries in your leftover gravy (because you asked for extra, right?).

The decor is unassuming and functional at best which may turn some people off, but what matters is the food and service, right? Both are exceptional here."}
{"text":"Finally.... Cleveland Yelpers come through.  Was on the way to the airport and wanted a quick lunch.  Found this.  About 2 miles from car rental return in a sleepy section of down town.
Made my way in at lunch hour.  Plenty of room at the stools at the counter.  Cute girl gets my order, runs it back and sandwich and cole slaw  arrives shortly thereafter.  Great bun with a substantial pile of meat, cheese and peppers.  Not too much of anything (well, maybe a bit more cheese than needed, but when is too much cheese a bad thing?).  I got the fried egg and the spicy three pepper cheesesteak.  Nice mix of alternative tunes playing, reasonably creative menu (includes cheesecake for dessert, but I had no room)  It won't unseat a Philly steak, but this is a nice little find among the loser places I have visited so far in Cleveland.  
A very good value for the price and nice people.  Low glam factor, which actually is a plus here."}
{"text":"\".......and I'd like an extra side of that brown gravy for my Cheesesteak.   No... make that a quart.\"

I'm not a cheesesteak aficionado, but I'd never heard of serving BEEF GRAVY with one.  Is this something new?  Or have I been lounging under a rock maybe a little too long?  Or has Big Daddy created the only way a cheesesteak should ever be offered.  In my book, his \"re-invention\" of a favorite may be a new classic.  (If anyone else is doing this, they've got some strong competition from this big guy at Cleveland's Kamm's Corners, to try coming even close to his addictive brown gravy goodness.)

It was the rule.  Gravy was always poured over slices of roast beef served on a PLATE---not on cheesesteaks.  Right?  Now that I've tried it?  Wrong.

The French Dip, with au jus, has been around forever, but that's more consomme.  The Italian Combo---iconic to Chicago---pretty much the same thing.  And the old diner favorite---open-faced beef sandwiches with mashed potatoes and gravy---might be the closest, but that's a knife and fork event---not something you'd ever pick up and eat with your hands---unless you're a cave-dweller.  

He's got something here---and it's a very good thing.  Per his handout menu, all cheesesteaks are ANGUS SIRLOIN.  I didn't read this until after eating half of his
\"Cleveland\"---a big two-mealer---and stopping because I was full.  But I wasn't surprised to read that---it only confirmed what I'd just experienced.   Very good-tasting, well-trimmed, not processed.  The real thing, sliced off a roast.  Also got another, but with chicken.  Again, good quality and well-prepared.

Came with mushrooms, caramelized onions, bell peppers, his own cheese sauce (not Cheez-Wiz, as stated by one of his fans), and a separate container of that fabulous gravy I could drink through a straw all by itself.   The hoagie bread was fresh-tasting, with a softer-type texture.  If not for the cheese sauce (good, but too intensely-flavored for this sandwich, in my opinion) it would be excellent---an easy 5 stars.  Would definitely get again, but I'll ask him to hold that component.  
                                   From $7-7.50
            Choice of white or wheat hoagie, or wrap.   
       When ordering, confirm exactly what's on each.  
In addition to the \"Cleveland\", other cheesesteaks offered:

*  Big Easy        Cajun Spice
*  Seoul Man     Hot & Sweet Korean BBQ sauce
*  Lone Star       Bacon, Sweet BBQ, and Cheddar cheese
*  Vegetarian     Portabello mushrooms, onions, peppers, 
                             and cheese
  (Chicken can be substituted...egg can be added for .50...
    up-sized for 2.25)

   All sandwiches---beef, chicken, or pork---come with 
                               sweet & sour slaw, 
                                horseradish slaw, 
                                   cajun slaw, or 
              dill-red skin (very good) potato salad.

Also offers four styles of Pulled Pork, 1/3 lb. Angus jumbo hot dogs 3.00, Home Fries, Super Deluxe Home Fries (topped with egg, gravy, and cheese), and soup.

Whew-w-w-w.  Have I forgotten anything?   No, he's not a relative---just a little local sandwich shop owner who should be admired for using quality, well-trimmed beef sirloin, when the \"big boys\" use low-grade.  Plus, he has no website, so I want to help out a little.    You go, Big Daddy!
