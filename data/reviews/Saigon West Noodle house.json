{"text":"What a wonderful find!  Great Vietnamese cuisine and fantastic service. Beef sate pho is among the best I've had in the city. We stop by several times a month and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not closed. Thank goodness!!!! It's quick and very good. Still attached to Humpty's which is a bit weird."}
{"text":"1) this places isn't closed. It's inside Humpty's. Got the beef pho and a spring roll. Totally solid, better than a lot of the nearby places.  This was my second visit here and it always been good. Very quiet."}
