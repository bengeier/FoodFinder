{"text":"Charming ambiance, fantastic service and delicious food! Wish I could eat at Goodfella's Pizza every night. Pizza, rice balls and cannoli are to die for. You will love it!!"}
{"text":"It is worth the wait! Their pizza is delicious, and you will even want to eat the crust! 
I've been there twice and tried the rice balls, which are fried up perfectly. The pizza is thin crust, and just the perfect chewiness - comes out very hot, very flavourful, with generous amounts of  toppings. I've tried the prosciutto, vegetable and seafood pizzas so far.  And for dessert, the cannoli is very tasty!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after the movies, really hungry.  The wait was not very long, but it was a Monday.  However, the place was PACKED.

Ordered the Gnocchi al Pesto and mushroom tagliatelle with chicken.

The service was really friendly and inviting. The food was served hot, flavourful, and a good size portion.  Secret, get the homemade hot sauce, fantastic!!!

Quite honestly, very satisfied with the overall experience.

I will come back for the pizza which everyone raves about, and the Italian rice balls.

Be back soon...."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pizza, calamari and lobster spaghetti. Although, slightly pricey, it was still delicious."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but I consider it was not fair for this nice restaurant losing a customer for this type of issue.  Everything started good with the waiter giving us advice about the pizzas and what to order. We ordered some wine and suddenly he came with 2 bottles, white and red. We clarified  him that we just wanted the glasses as we never implied that we wanted the bottles. Since then, he seemed a little bit upset. He didn't even approach us to ask if the food was good. We even had to ask for water a couple of times because he didn't come to give us more, when he will do it for other tables. It seems that the table was plated for 2 and we were 3 people. He didn't even care to check if we had one extra plate, clutery, etc. I asked for the salami plate as appetizer and he brought the cheesr plate. At the end we just tip him a 10% as we didn't feel he gave us a good service, and he just had that \"look\" when we left. I love the food and the pizza was excellent.  But unfortunately I didn't like the service that we had today."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere but the service was meh, or at least for the last few times when I was there served by an middle aged lady. It took her 15 mins to bring us water when the whole restaurant was empty. She barely checked on us and when she did, she had the weirdest look as if she didn't want to serve us. After we paid our bill and stood up to leave, she gave us the dirtiest look (and we tipped her properly regardless of her poor service)! Love the food but probably won't go back again - the experience there just doesn't measure up."}
{"text":"The place is cluttered and it's rather easy to bump into other people's tables. The pizza itself was good but not mindblowing. The calamari was alright."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!

I've been looking for a good local pizza place and I finally found one!!

We ordered:
The octopus appetizer. It was cooked to perfection and came with a arugula/cabbage salad with a green bruschetta drizzle. 

Prosciutto & arugula pizza. Soooo good. 

Italian beer, came in a wine bottle. Beer is fermented in the wine barrels. Delicious. 

We asked about a smoke salmon pizza and they're going to be putting it on their menu shortly.  Can't wait. 

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We wanted to make a reservation for Friday night. \"Forget about it! Be here early...\" is what you'll be told. It was a chilly night and having 10 adults cram in and around the door, with other guests walking in and out, was not an enjoyable 20 to 30-minute wait (but at least it was warm). The owner was nice enough to pop a bottle of red wine for us to enjoy while waiting though.

The design and decor made the restaurant feel very cozy and welcoming. It shows that they put a lot of thought into it. The ambiance was nice. With all the chatter and the music, it would have been a bit too noisy for me but we sat in one of the back rooms (it's not as small as we had thought!) so it was a lot quieter.

The service was pretty good. Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu items. We could tell the staff were all exhausted from such a busy night, yet our waiter always came by to check up on us.

We ordered a prosciutto and arugula personal pizza and a porcini mushroom truffle pasta. The pizza was a good size and it was tasty, but it was a bit chewy. The pasta was good, except some of the pasta was sticking together so some bites were chunky... But I'll still give another pasta dish a try next time. 

We were stuffed...but we couldn't resist from trying their desserts. We ordered a cappuccino and tiramisu. The tiramisu made my night! I love tiramisu and this tiramisu was delightful. I would return to this restaurant just so I can have their tiramisu again!

All in all, the wait was worth it. It is a little pricey, but it was an enjoyable dining experience and I love cozy, comfortable restaurants like Goodfellas."}
{"text":"Judging all the reviews it is hit and miss. Overpriced.  Much better places are in the gta but I guess it is a hot spot so can't fault the profit motive.  Mine was a miss.  Poor service, nice place and healthy choices not an option.  I got the feeling I needed to spend a lot for lunch to get better service."}
{"text":"Fabulous service from Alyssa and great food. Seafood done to perfection whether it was grilled or fried. The kitchen knows what they are doing! Gluten free pizza and pasta available. Absolutely delicious. Thanks for a great evening!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Haven't tried the pasta yet, because the pizza is great! There's so many options to choose from here. Also, the happy and cheerful staff really set a friendly atmosphere for a great lunch or dinner. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience. The service was good too. The food on the other hand not so much. We ordered the Margarita Pizza and the Pesto Gnocchi. The pizza was a little under cooked. The Gnocchi was over seasoned. We would've ordered dessert but our main course didn't hit the spot so decided to skip on the dessert."}
{"text":"Good place in Streetsville during the summer due to its lively ambiance. Patio looked nice but we could not get a seat out there despite the fact that our friends had requested the patio when making reservations. When we questioned our server and the restaurant manager on this, we were not taken seriously a tall. Verging on rude. There were 4 of us ...2 couples.. when we asked for our bill to be sepalled for each couple it was a major production. The calamari was the worst I have ever eaten but the rest of the meal was ok. I think the pizza is the best bet here."}
{"text":"So glad I listened to other reviews and made a reservation. This place was packed Friday evening. If you don't make a reservation be prepared to wait at least 20 mins. 

The ambience was great, had an authentic Italian vibe to it. I noticed opera music playing in the background which was a nice touch. Our waiter was very attentive despite the full restaurant. 

On to the food: I ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza, my girlfriend ordered the sea bass. (Beware it's not a filet so if you don't like to pick out bones, don't order it.) It was perfectly cooked and very nicely seasoned. My pizza was fantastic. I especially loved the crispy yet chewy crust. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had but I'd definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since they opened. Their pizza is top-notch, they know what they are doing. Pasta is ok, everything is pretty good here.

So 3 stars only? A few things, and I hope they see this and ponder it maybe?
- Since they have opened their non-pizza dishes I have noticed the quality take a hit just a tad. Still good, but the prices do not match the quality.
-The thing that sticks out in my mind is the cannoli. Last I came, you spend a good bit of money for 3 tiny tiny shells that were hard as rocks and about 5mm thick. Wasn't good, kind of a rip-off.
-In winter time, they need to get their seating worked out with their heating vents - some of their seating is right next to a heating vent and it makes for a very very uncomfortable dinning experience.

Now I say the above with love! They got great wine, food is fresh, good staff and a nice decor. Also they make good espresso which many places screw up. But I have noticed the food quality dip a bit but the prices are still high. That gets me, when you charge near high end dinning prices and serve Jack Astor level food. The food is good, but you feel ripped off.

Probably in a few months I'll give them another shot, maybe I went on a very off day, every resto has them."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Appetizers and pizza were delicious! 15 mins between the appetizers and pizza. The right timing to enjoy the food! No rush from the server or the kitchen, at the end that's why you go to a restaurant! We really enjoyed our time there! Alessia was our server and she exeded the expectations! I will go back again!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The best part of the experience was the Goodfellas wine! Only $5 before 5pm. Would defiantly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited for the first time last night, and we'll definitely return.  The food was fantastic.  We started with anitpasti misto and each opted for pasta dishes.  I had the pesto and my husband the vongole.  The wine on tap by the glass was really smooth too!  The atmosphere was relaxed and lively, service was super and the clientele was all ages.  The restaurant is surprisingly large inside and the decor is really nice.  Many years ago we went to the bar that previously occupied that space and it's simply amazing how they've transformed it into something so beautiful.  I can't wait until the construction work on the street is completed so they can bring back their patio area.  With the upgrades being made to the street outside, Goodfellas is going to be a real hotspot in Streetsville."}
{"text":"Nice decor and great food. Pizza comes with scissors, interestingly. Their meat and cheese platter is the way to go for communal apps."}
{"text":"Excellent napolitana style pizza.  One of the tastiest margheritas out there. Service is good but a few times(each time from a different server) have had the waitresses claim they \"don't carry change\" when I went in for take out, only to witness them provide change to others while waiting for my order.  Kind of sad they resort to this since I'm a good tipper even on take out but now I think I'll just pay for my order only. Most waitress are fine though and it hasn't happened last 2 times so maybe they've done something about it. Otherwise would be a 5star"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza in the GTA. We are regulars at the Streetsville location. Try the calamari appetizer. Grilled or lightly battered, it's delicious too:)"}
{"text":"Horrible steak even though they say the steak is from Iowa and farm raised.  Every part of the steak was made different. Peas were half frozen still. Went for a birthday party. Service was good. Had pizza too. Was nothing to drool  over."}
{"text":"This place has probably above average pizzas however is too expensive for the quality that you get...I ordered also the appetizer that has diferent kinds of ham...Milestones has better plates for the same price or cheaper. Decoration is nice and service is good. There are better options though."}
{"text":"My wife and I  where less then impressed, perhaps it was a one off. 

The place looks like the old country.

We had some wine, the first glass had no gravity, then we asked for chianti and what we got was NOT chianti, then I argued why I did not believe what was in my glass, to no avail.    

The salad was good but, you don't  win friends with salad. 

The pizza had segregated toppings, literally. After we where told '\"thats the way its done\", I've never seen a pizza like the one we had that night. they should to told us... 

At least,  the draft beet was good.


Furthermore I cant understand why owners of eating establishments spend all kinds of money on aesthetics but overlook water quality, a simple revers osmosis would do wonders, and Goodfellas pizza is no exception. 


Good day,
M"}
{"text":"If you like salty food, this is your place.  I think they cornered the salt market.  Everything from the salad, veal and pizza was terrible.   The calamari was the lone bright spot.   Never again,  overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Cannot say much about the food but the service is definitely lacking and dishonest. Came in at 7:30 and was told there would be a 30 min wait, still not seated at 8:30pm. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"Pizza was quite good quite the Italian.  Loved the fresh mozzarella and service was good too.  Tried the margarita,  margarita with argula and the IL pesto pizza.  We had a great time.  :))"}
{"text":"Best place in Mississauga for pizza hands down!!!
Great atmosphere, great service, place gets packed for a reason....try the pasta also...patio in the summer is great ."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. Especially love the eggplant parmigiana and the pizza is great. Nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Went for Lunch past Sunday. Ordered 2 pizza's, Pepperoni Pizza and the Prosciutto Arugula Pizza. The pizza was think crust and it was awesome. I ordered the Osso Buco. It was pretty good but not tender as I was hoping it was (6.5/10). The sauce in the Osso Buco and the mash potatoes was amazing.

Found for Lunch it was way overpriced. Not sure why they wouldn't have a lunch special menu.
For 2 pizza's, the Osso Buco and one apple juice. Nothing else, the bill was $82.50 + I left a 20% tip with almost make it $100. Way way to expensive for just a lunch. 

Will not return again, sorry!

The place is beautiful inside and very trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Gave it a second try. Ordered two party size pizzas..smh idk what the hype is with this place. Will not be coming here a third time. Crust was too salty. Pizza wasn't even cut properly. Toppings were uneven. Totally not worth the $60. Might as well gone to pizza pizza."}
{"text":"food was good, price was fine, SERVICE WAS HORRRRRRRRRIBLE! 

if you'd like to experience the hype then I recommend going for lunch when it isn't too busy. 

my friend and I made reservations and we still had to wait for 20 mins to be seated, 
our server was so rude. Firstly he asked if we were ready to order after about 1 minute of looking at the menu, after that he didn't come back for a long time. Thirdly, I ordered a glass of white wine and he gave me red instead. 

Later on he was trying to I guess \"clear the table\" I had half a pizza still on my plate and he said \"I know you're just going to share your pizza with your friend\" so why don't you give it to her. He was rushing us out so he could get another couple in our table and it was extremely off putting. 

Atmosphere is kinda loud and disheveled, for lack of a better word. Kind of hard to hear the person sitting in front of you which is amazing because you are sitting in extremely tight quarters. 

The food was delicious despite the rude service."}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza, Goodfellas has it made (no Italian pun intended) It's safe to say, you won't find the type of pizzas goodfellas make, anywhere else. Soft doe with delicious toppings that complement each other beautifully.  

Their wine is top notch. The best of quality, authentically Italian. 

The only thing I would want improved is their \"meat\" selection on their menu. 

But if you are going their for their appetizers, pizza or wines; you will absolutely love it. Very very very good place. Beautiful environment and service as well."}
{"text":"I have been to goodfella's many times, and my team at work decided to come here for a team lunch.
Our food was AMAZING!  You could taste the freshness of the ingredients.  Reminds me of being in Italy with my family.

Our server, Sandra, paid little attention to us.  She came to refill our water only once, and we had to ask her to do it.  She made no effort to connect with us, we almost seemed as if we were asking her to do too much when we asked for the bill. 

We wanted to be out in 1 hour and 30 minutes and ended up staying almost 2 hours because we thought she forgot about us.

I would return to this restaurant however would not want to sit in her section again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.

I always drive past this place on my way home. Finally, my friend and I decided we should stop one day. We finally stopped in on a Thursday night.

To start, we ordered the arancini balls and split them. They were huge and delicious. (Sorry I don't have a picture of them before we dug in)

I ordered carbonara for my entree. My best friend is Italian and her mom makes the best carbonara - or so I thought. The carbonara at Goodfellas is something else. So fresh and flavourful. The portion size was perfect for me. 

Oh! That's another thing - I got to speak with our server, Keith, and he informed me that all of the meats and cheeses at Goodfellas are imported from Italy. The meats are all cured in house. All the ingredients are fresh. They make their own pasta and grow their own arugula. The executive chef is also from Italy and doesn't speak English but he did design the entire menu.

I will definitely be back for pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but overpriced! The quality of services goes down each time I go back. And now they have started charging for water and bread! I used to love this place but with the service quality going down and them charging for everything, I think I will have to find a new pizza place."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner a few weeks ago. We were a party of about 11 people celebrating a birthday so we got our own private room, which was nice (albeit loud because it was right next to the kitchen).

We got there around 9pm. After ordering our food, we waited about an hour and 35 mins. We complained a few times to our waitress and were told that it's a very busy night, but our food should be ready soon. We were very hungry so unfortunately one of the people on the table got slightly vocal with their complaints to the waitress, and the food was there minutes after our final complaint with an apology from a new waiter.  

Food was excellent, staff were very friendly, and the atmosphere was top notch, but the wait times were very, very long. Due to our very long delay, we actually had to stay after closing hours just to get our food. The staff did not rush us or make us feel unwelcome at all, but it was still an awkward experience. 

Hopefully this is a one time thing and not the usual experience that you'll get at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very beautiful place, nice servants and delicious dishes. We went there for lunch. We tried the rice balls which was very impressive~ crunchy on the outside and fluffy&cheezy inside, really yummy, recommended! Linguini was very creamy but I little bit too much for me. The famous wood oven pizza was very different from the American pizza, the dough was pretty chewy and the best part was that the pizza bread was not oily at all. loved it! Will go back and try other stuff. Nice experience."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Pizza in the GTA. The patio is amazing, it is so intimate. Great for a date or with friends. I have been a total of 3 times. Great service, delicious food, and wonderful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! Rude, rude, rude. Will not be returning to this restaurant ever again. I am not an avid reviewer, but my experience at this restaurant last night was beyond horrible and I had to write about it. Definitely would not recommend this place to any one looking to go out for dinner and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Cute Italian restaurant in Streetsville; great atmosphere with wood oven pizzas. I also got the gnocchi...not normally a fan of tomato sauce but the sauce in this dish was pleasant. The mushroom risotto was also good but not great."}
{"text":"A streetsville classic! Finally got a chance to try this place out and it has joined the rankings of my favourite Italian restaurants in the city. We went on a Wednesday evening and surprisingly it was so empty, they gave us the best seats in the house (by the window, overlooking the kitchen, very Hell's Kitchen-esque). We ordered the Diavolo pizza and Mediterranean Sea bass. Both were amazing, I highly recommend! Service is also good and you can tell the chefs have fun while they cook. Such a warm, inviting restaurant. Can't wait to go back!

Top it off with some gelato across the street, and this is a great date spot!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, pizza was great.  The bolognese was not good and would not recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for a late night snack and wine on a Saturday night.  It was pretty packed and happening.  We were kind of lucky to get a table for 2.  I can't comment on the entres because we only ordered a couple of appetizers.  We had the octopus and the cured meat platter.  They were both excellent and more than enough for us.  The octopus was tender and grilled to perfection.  It came with some greens and a slice of flat bread.   The cured meat platter came with 4 types of meats and bread and olives.  There was a lot of meat and it was great.  The atmosphere was charming.  The staff was wonderful."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza fresh out of their oven. The grilled octopus is app is also very good. I would definitely recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Ey Vinnie, who's da kid? 

Ahhh, Freddo that's da bosses new guy, calls himself \"The pizza man\"... He's a real Goodfella. 

The pizza man aka Goodfella is the new boss when it comes to wood fired pizza in the Mississauga neighbourhood of Streetsville.

With an expert location occupying a full corner of the town centre you can't miss it as you drive along Queen st. 

Entering from the cold the first thing I see is a server wearing a fedora. Perfect. This seems like the place. Decorated in a classic Italian restaurant style with stone walls, gorgeous light fixtures and arched doorways it's the Italian restaurant you'd expect with a little something special when it comes to the staff working da joint - I'm talking about you Rob. Even the day after a concussion the guy still kicked ass. 

Now what about the food? Well I didn't go nuts because I'm watching my girlish figure but Rob sold me on the Napoletana style crust (you can choose between that and Romano style). After choosing the crust I decided on the prosciutto and arugula pizza which came topped with pesto, buffalo mozzarella and shaved asiago cheese. 

MINGA!!!! MOLTO BENE!!

Loved the pizza, the casual friendly atmosphere, service, and decor. Don't be a wise guy, next time you're looking for wildfired pizza ... Check out Goodfellas

Eatcrest out."}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite restaurants! Little taste of authentic Italian food in the heart of Streetsville!"}
{"text":"Came here today with the BEST BOSS EVER ahem. Started smelling the delicious wood fired pizza from the outside and was super excited to go in and escape the cold with some freshly baked pizza goodness. I decided to let my boss decide on the pizza we shared since he is Italian, so pizza is clearly his turf. So we ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza (for description pls read 5th par of Kris U's review).

When the pizza came I was suuuuuppeeeer impressed with what we got. First of all, I'm used to my pizza feeling really heavy and fattening. This was not the case here. The crust was light and didn't feel too doughy. The arugula and tomatoes made the pizza taste fresh to death, almost like I was eating a salad. The cheese, agh, flavourful but far from being greasy. Never in my life have I finished eating a pizza without feeling like a fatso. This has been accomplished at Goodfellas.

Service was also very friendly and hospitable. Our server let us know the difference b/w Napoletana style crust and Romano style, which I never knew before. OH which reminds me, the chef is from Naples, where pizza was invented. I feel like I went on a pizza crash course =)

BATHROOM NOTICE: Be ultra careful when you open the door to the washroom, cause the stairs are RIGHT there. Yes, it is a downstairs basement, much to my surprise. Thankfully, I utilized my ninja skills to regain balance before rolling down a flight of stairs. I do love the cleanliness of the washroom though. And the Italian Godfather esque music that was playing down there."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for the longest time. I can't tell you how many times I have driven by this corner resto and seen all the great online reviews. So I proudly took my wife and in-laws so that we all could try it for the first time.

Their food: It is exemplary. The portion, the size, the taste, the texture. True Italian food made from scratch with real ingredients. After biting into the pizza and gnocci, it tasted like I was touring around Italy all over again.

The décor: Absolutely fantastic, warm, and classy. 

The service: This is what killed our dining experience. We were originally served by a waitress who had started taking our order. After that, she never came back to our table to check on us, never offered to have our drinks refilled, never came to our table at all. We had dirty cutlery which needed replacing. She was nowhere to be found. I had to search for someone to give us some sort of service. Luckily, a very energetic man named Oscar paid full attention to our needs. If it weren't for him, we wouldn't have finished off our meal without the nasty taste of poor service in our minds. Shortly after we left, my sister-in-law made a complaint to the floor manager how that server almost completely ruined our meal.

We may not ever eat at Goodfellas again especially since we received such poor service from a highly-rated restaurant. But if we do return, it won't be for a very long time and if Oscar is still working there by that time, I only want service from him."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good atmosphere. I've been three times and ordered the same thing all times (creative, I know) anyways the first 2 times I went, service was great and my food came fairly quickly. Last time I went, it took them OVER 45 MINUTES to get one pizza to my table. I hadn't even ordered a complex pizza, I ordered a simple margarita pizza (spelling??)- which is basically a cheese.   Pizza.       45 minutes to get a cheese pizza to my table, with out any waiter interaction at all, if it was being made fresh and we had to wait for dough or something, then I would understand, but we weren't told anything about why our wait was so long. 

Overall I would recommend, but just be aware of wait times"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Wow. We had the proscuitto and the 4 cheese pizza. Ridiculously good. Love this place. Atmosphere is gorgeous and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews on yelp, I was really looking forward to try see what the hype was about.

I came here around 8pm with 3 friends and asked for patio. It was pretty busy, so we waited for about 30 minutes for a spot to free up. Not much of a big deal.

We then we're seated....without a menu! We were sitting there for a good 10-15 minutes without a menu. Already a rough start. Once we got our menu, we chose our drinks and food. I got one of their light beers and a Diavolo pizza. I chose the Diavolo because I like sausages on my pizza lol. 

After our orders have been placed, we waited for about 40minutes before noticing the table beside ours got their appetizers before us, but sat down well after us. We called the waitress to complain, and she said she forgot to punch in the appetizer...wow! She then put a rush on the appetizer and we got it 10 minutes later. The appetizer was calamari...which I'm not a fan of, so I have been sitting there the whole time drinking my beer, starving while waiting for over an hour. I ended up waiting a total of 1 hour and 20 minutes for my food. The place didn't even look that busy. I was very unimpressed with the service here and the wait.

When I got my Diavolo pizza, it looked great. I took a bite and noticed most of the bottom of the pizza was burnt. After all that time of waiting, I get a burnt pizza. I didn't ask for them to remake it because it would have probably taken super long again, I I sucked it up and ate around the burnt parts.

I really hope this was a one time bad experience as I do want to come back and try their oyster bar opening later this summer, but my first experience has me worried."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here since it opened and only just got around to it! 

It surpassed my expectations!! 

We started with a cheese board , I forget the name and then both got a pizza !! 

omg everything about it was delicious & fresh 

Will 100% be back and I can't wait !! 

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Appetizer were good, main dish the veal scallops was very oily but liked the over all experience with Italian songs and the declaration I might go again to try the oven pizza.."}
{"text":"Had the lobster pasta and it was amazing. Also try the netela pizza YUM!!
can't wait to go back to try the shrimp pasta. 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"Check past review if you want to know about our first experience. 

We decided to give Goodfellas pizza another chance And so we went a couple weeks ago. It was a Saturday evening and as expected it was an extremely busy night.  I found that this time around the service was better but honestly not the best. I found the servers to be a little stand off-ish and not friendly. However I have to say that the food was absolutely delicious. On another note according to the servers, Goodfellas pizza also serves Halal meat which is a bonus for us! Not sure if I would go back there again, and that is only due to the service."}
{"text":"Great Food, Love the pizza, calamari and the atmosphere. Prices are on point.Only thing lacking is the service. Been here about 3 times, had to wait very long for food... forgot my pizza twice!"}
{"text":"We had reservations for 9:00pm for two but there ended up being 3 of us we only had to wait 10 mins while having a glass of wine. 

I liked the ambiance and live music (a man with a guitar played gypsy kings and hotel California) the service was great, food looked and tasted amazing all and all it was a great experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stone Baked Pizza was interesting , i ordered the party size pizza (Pizza Picante) ...thing is a monster....menu says that it feeds 2, I can assure you as a 190 lb man, it can feed me 3 times. 

A giant rectangular pizza , crisp and nice dough with gooey cheese pockets (not spread around everywhere like traditional american style pizza) and large salami spread all around. I asked for additional hot paste ( VERY GOOD). My only qualm was the pizza came covered in Arugula. Kind of overwhelmed the taste (bitterer). 

The ambience was amazing , the servers were some of the most professional and well mannered probably ever. However the bill came out to $60 for a pizza and 2 beers, made me regret not getting a pasta (which sounded delicious BTW). Overall, was a good experience."}
{"text":"I came back after a year, and something didn't feel the same with the menu. The chicken fettuccine alfredo was not what it once was, and I was slightly disappointed. 

That being said, the place is still good, but it wasn't the same."}
{"text":"Late lunch on a Fridsy afternoon.  Quaint Italian resto in Streetsville.  Nice variety of salads, pizzas, pastas, arincini and other comfort foods.

We ordered the arugula blood orange salad and the roasted vegetable pizza.   The salad was fresh and perfectly dressed.  Pizza was a 12\" thin crust chewy crispy crust with generous dollops of cheese and diced eggplant, zucchini, and other veggies.

Service was friendly. Will definitely come back for dinner too!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: restaurant decor and ambiance is nice but the music just kept going from soft to loud sporadically and when it was loud it wasn't pleasing and hard to carry a conversation. 
Service: we didn't like our server. She just wasn't cut out to be a server. Last time I was here I also didn't like the service (from another server). 
Food: it was good, but not great and a pizza is not worth $21 (or $26 if you want to add chicken as a topping). Last time i came I had to wait 30 minutes before I could even order."}
{"text":"Oh GF Pizza, I want to love you so much but you fell short of my expectations. Being a Sicilian born gal, I have high expectations of Italian joints. Firstly, the aesthetics of GF is on point. The restaurant and location is beautiful. Its a little tight on busy nights but the atmosphere is wonderful. Of the many times I have been, I find the service to be spotty with staff that can be a little less than friendly. This is a sore spot for me. Such a great place and having not so great people makes me not want to come back. The pizza, which I ordered the class Margarita was okay. The sauce was not seasoned however the mozzarella was amazing (the only reason I would come back is for that mozzarella). Overall, it was okay-we may return again in the future but it won't be frequent visits."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent wood-fired pizza in Mississauga!  We've been looking for one for awhile and thought that we'd have to go to Toronto to get it. I saw the place featured in Mississauga Life and checked out the rating on Yelp. There is road construction currently on-going but the place is still easily accessible. We had the octopus appetizer, pasta carbonara, margherita pizza, and tiramisu for dessert. The pizza was just right. Not too heavy. I'd love to go back and try other flavours. The carbonara came with raw egg yolk on a half shell. Once poured onto the pasta, it just envelopes your mouth in this creamy velvety texture. I loved it! I would also like to try their truffle pasta. The octopus appetizer was good, too. It came with some greens and a light dressing. 

We thought the service was good. The gentleman was friendly and quite efficient. He was tending more than a few tables but managed to stay attentive. 

The portions are not large. The personal sized pizza is good for one person. The pasta portion is just enough that I still had room for dessert. My husband and I thought they got the portion sizes just right. 

I'd love to go back and try other dishes! I'm giving this 5 stars because I thought it was one great dining experience I haven't had in a long time."}
{"text":"Recently open in the Streetsville area of Mississauga,Goodfellas is a very welcome addition for Italian food lovers.

My visit was part of a group and we had a table reserved, therefore we didn't have much of a wait time but other diners commented that the wait time was approx 30-40 minutes for a table

Pro's:
- All ingredients on the pizza were fresh and good quality--sausage was flavorful
but not greasy.
- Pizza has a nice thin, chewy crust with the right amount of texture. Minimal amount of tomato sauce and isn't swimming in oil
- The guys serving us..Marco especially were very attentive and easy going and knowledgeable about their offerings. 
- We were surprised to see that, despite the line up of people outside the inside seating area of Goodfellas although busy didn't feel too cramped.  
-Portion sizes are decent for the price one pizza could easily serve two people
-Decor is rustic with long communal tables mixed with smaller tables and some booths

Con's:
- The wait. --not sure I would want to return and wait 45mins in line--I may go the takeout route.
- As they have only been in operation for a week they have some service kinks to work out such as offering individual billing for large groups.  
-Noise level was off the charts in the room we had our meal..plus they had music at a level that when combined with the chatter of other diners was just too loud."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restuarant with a great vibe and good food this is the place to be. Their wood oven pizzas are delicious and pastas are cooked well! The only thing I would say was a disappointment would be the service I got, friendly staff but did not pay attention to details and ended up forgetting my entree. From that point it took another 20 min to get my entree to the table at that point I asked for attention to go box."}
{"text":"My friend who loves streetsville and lives out on the west end told me about this restaurant. 
I had the Arancini, it's way too dried inside. The rice inside lacks flavours. I didn't enjoy it. Onto my seafood pasta, the portion was small. I think the pasta can be a little softer, the large shrimp on top, I saved it to last as it looks large and tasty, however I was disappointed, the texture didn't taste too good. Overall, I didn't really enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"So for those of you that frequent the Streetsville area im sure you have either seen this place or been to this place.  I am also sure that many of you have either been turned away or had to wait a very long time to get a table without a reservation.  For those of you who were planning on eating here at some point PLEASE make reservations.  This is Streetsville's HOT SPOT.  The crowds alone is enough to tell you how good the food is.  They specialize in their wood oven Italian pizza but their other dishes are amazing as well.  

We were with a group for a birthday so we ordered some rice balls as apps and they were cooked to perfection.  Deep fried goodness.  Super tasty, cheesy and the marinara sauce was amazing.  We also shared a prosciutto & arugula pizza.  Cooked amazing and probably one of the best Italian pizzas I have had.  For dinner I decided to go with the pasta made with mushrooms and truffle oil.  By far one of the best pasta dishes I have had.  Savory, creamy delicious.  Left me gathering the left over sauce with a piece of bread.

Service was great and the restaurant is very clean and trendy.  Will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Was there tonight to celebrate my wedding anniversary food was amazing excellent service and the staff was awesome. It was our first time but not our last."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner here.  The ambiance is great and our server was delightfully friendly.  They have a $50.00 course fixed price menu which includes wine, an appetizer, an entree, dessert and coffee.  I didn't have this because I wasn't too hungry, but my companions did and they said that the house wine was great, the appetizers was a huge serving, the calamari being a better choice than the rice balls and the pasta was great.  I find that the price of the pizza is quite high at $20.00 plus and the pasta was below or around $20.00 which is ok.  I've been here before but I only had the time to review it now, and based on past experience, the pizza was just okay.  The pasta I had was the funghi pasta with truffle oil and  you can really smell and taste the infusion of the truffle oil on the pasta.  I liked it very much.

It's a great place to just meet, eat and relax with friends.  There is no designated parking lot for this place.  You have to find street parking or find another parking lot.

Additional Edit:  I really enjoyed their cappuccino!!! Do try!!"}

{"text":"Not worth the drive from Maple

Its pretty simple to serve up pizza these days and hang a wood fired oven sign and wait for a line up but its also so simple to lose a customer

Serve the pizza that comes out of 900 degree oven cold,,,,,

Dont ask if you require any hot chili peppers or oil....Pizza Nova does that

Serve canned mushrooms on the pizza and charge $20 bucks for it 

Look at the 15% tip, snap the payment folio book shut and walk away without a thanks, thank you, enjoy the rest of your evening, ya'll come back now ya hear, ciao goombah

If you get the Franscisco waiter then just move to another seat where he is not serving because the gibrone waiter ruined our little date night by being such a jerk.

I will say the pizza did have very nice char and a crisp edge and was properly thinned out so the pizzaiolo is working the stick in the oven nicely,,...too bad the waiter took forever to deliver the pizza and ruined a possibly great pizza

My test is always how long does it take to bring me my pizza since i know how long it takes to prep it, cook it and deliver it because wood fired is the same as wood fired gas assist to some people and 600 degrees gas is not 950 degrees wood. So a cold pizza is just plain lousy interest in ensuring a wonderful customer experience.

If the server was respectful of his patrons then yeah 3 stars, if the food was delivered hot from the oven.....then 3.5 stars............

Excellent food can surpass lousy service and awesome ambiance can surpass lousy food but lousy food and lousy service wont put a smile on any goodfella"}
{"text":"Finally convinced my dad to come here one day when we were the last two to fend for our dinners after everyone else ate pho. I convinced him to try something new,  and attempted to make a reservation on a Sunday night but they were booked solid til 8pm. We arrived at 7 and I let the hostess know my name and its a table for 2. She let us know it'll be 15 to 20 mins wait,  I went towards the front as all the guests before us (about 3 small tables) and 1 table after us were seated. She looked at me and started asking for how many before realizing she already spoken and forgot about us. She then said another 10 minutes before a table will be ready. When we were finally seated in the room in the back there were many tables available so I'm not sure what the delay the whole time was for.

Either way I was super excited about the food and our waiter was friendly and funny. We ordered the prosciutto pizza (I've been craving Al Forno pizza all month) and the fried veal and rice balls. The first few bites of the rice balls were really good,  fried crispy on the outside but doused with delicious tomato sauce made the perfect combination. The bites of melted cheese inside were a nice surprise and added to the medley of flavors. I wish the meat wasn't so minced because we could hardly tell that it was meat. It came with a nice salad on the side. Tip: these balls were huge,  could definitely be a meal. 

Next time I'll order them to come out separately cause the rice balls were very good hot and fresh but then started getting soggy and mushy add we dug in on the pizza. The waiter did offer this choice, I just didn't think it through. 

The pizza was delicious! The saltiness of the prosciutto was nicely balanced with the fresh ingredients of arugula, tomatoes and cheeses on the pizza.  I would have tried dessert if I wasn't so deliciously full. Next time for sure! 

Their pizza oven broke down after ours came out so I felt pretty bad for the pair sitting next to us having to watch us ready our pizzas. Since the tables were extremely close together they could practically taste or pizza and we could smell their disappointment. Also heard their whole conversation. :/

It did take a while for us to get our waiter's attention to fill our water glass and get the bill which came back with too much change. Lucky for him we were honest and left the extra. Hopefully on my next visit the service will be great and that will prove that it was just an off night for them. 

Next time I'll bring my friends armed with a reservation and a bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"I usually don't venture out to fancier-end restaurants but I'm absolutely glad I did this time. Arrived on a friday night without reservations and the place was quite packed. However, the waitress did manage to find a table for us. And I must say, the ambiance is great, it feels like you're in a fancy little place in italy.

I recommend getting the grilled octopus appetizer, it wasn't overcooked and has a great bbq smell to it. The main star of the show are the wood oven baked pizzas. They taste far better than anything else as you can actually taste the fresh ingredients. It's not a typical greasy, cheese packed on pizza.

Pricing is a little bit on the high-end than I'm normally used to, especially if you add in alcohol but it's definitely worth it. Great place to take somebody on a date."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. (a Tuesday night) Sat on patio. Great looking restaurant but definitely not worth the money. 
Wasn't impressed. 
Arancini balls 3 for $15!, calamari 6-8 pieces for $19?? Pasta mushroom tagliatelle and veg pizza ($20 each) was good but nothing to brag about. bf thought food was oily. Glass of wine- $9, didnt taste like a good quality valpoliciella.  Couldnt tell waitet bc she never came to check on us. Patio is a great location and inside decor is nice but really not worth the money. Waiter never refilled our water. We were better off going with our first choice Burger Legend. 

Location 9; taste of food 7, value 6; service 6.5; portion 7; menu variety 7"}
{"text":"Yummy and delicious pizza and food. The ambience and food is phenomenal. The dessert is also fantastic. This place can do no wrong."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't get pizza at a pizza place or at least an Italian restaurant with the word 'pizza' in the name. But I enjoyed this enough that I will definitely come back for them! (I was brought here without any prior knowledge in my defense). Goodfellas is a good Italian option in Streetsville. 

I was brought here by my lovely partner and we decided to sit outside on the patio. The atmosphere was extremely pleasant. We went with their arugula salad, a calamari appetizer, and one amatriciana pasta. 

The food was excellent but the prices were definitely on the high side, and the portion sizes could reflect that. But I can't deny that things were superb here. The calamari was extremely tender and the breading was crisp yet light. It was on the salty side for me but I understand it's supposed to be like that. I didn't expect salad with the calamari so that was a pleasant surprise, but it seemed like that came at the expense of the calamari. The amatriciana pasta was great. Everything worked so well. The bucatini pasta was perfectly al-dente, the sauce was excellent, I loved the spice level of this dish, and I could taste some smokiness from the pork.

After reading many reviews about terrible service (we didn't get that here) so I was fairly surprised actually. Our waiter, Eric, was attentive and friendly. The appetizers came out quickly and there were no problems whatsoever. 

All in all, we had an extremely pleasant dinner here and would definitely recommend them as an Italian option in Mississauga! Now let's get their pizzas."}
{"text":"I debated between giving 3 or 4 stars. I've been twice, both in the last year. 

The more recent time was just a couple weeks ago - a friend and I went and shared 2 wood-oven pizza: Quattro Formaggi (4 cheese) and Il Bosco (pesto with mushrooms). 

4 cheese was very good, Il Bosco was average. We agreed that there was just too much crust on both, and Il Bosco had less cheese than we would have liked. 

Service was minimal, neither of us are particularly fussy so that didn't matter much."}
{"text":"Great spot! The octopus mmmmmm. The pizzas...mmmmm. The pastas....mmmmm.
I have been to all of the locations and this is the BEST one ! It's a smaller location which makes the service a but more personal. The staff are clearly passionate about the food and able to explain all the ingredients. Come here regularly and still exploring the menu. Best part...call for pizza and it will be done quickly....way better than any other delivery. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My sister recommended this place to me because she knows how much I love pizza. My boyfriend and I went there on a Friday night and it had a 30-45 minute wait, which is usual for any given restaurants. After finally being seated we ordered the Vegetables alla Gridlia and the Parmigiana di Melanze. We were concerned about portions for the pizza, but it actually fed us both and we ended up bringing some home. I will be honest and say that it's not the best pizza I've ever had but it was good. 

For the Parmigiana di Melanze, the waiter warned me it would be a 25 minute wait because they bake it layer by layer. Which sounded awesome at the time because it made it seem like it was prep the proper way. At the end of it all, I wasn't too impress with it, I wouldn't order it again and it was definitely not worth the wait. The experience made me realize, perhaps I don't like Italian food as much as I think I do. =p"}
{"text":"On Sunday January 7, 2018 we went to Goodfellas Pizza in Streetsville to celebrate my birthday. The food was disappointing and unlike our previous experiences. They apparently changed their menu about a month ago.

As we ordered dessert, both my niece and nephew, who suffer from peanut and tree nut allergies, asked if the chocolate gelato was nut free. Our server came back and said it was indeed nut free. As my niece bit into something crunchy, she immediately began to feel a tingling in her mouth. She removed something from her mouth and it looked like a nut. My mom who was also eating a chocolate gelato, picked out an even bigger nut from her serving. My nephew, a toddler, was also eating it and he had not yet been tested for nut allergies.

Thankfully, both my niece and nephew didn't have more severe reactions. My niece specifically, who suffered the symptom was very scared for a few minutes. What was a celebration could have turned out very badly.

And this didn't seem to faze the restaurant management/owners. The fact that they didn't take anything off our bill is beside the point. Nor am I looking for anything from them as I will never return to this establishment. What compels me to publicize this experience is that they claim to not have known that there were nuts in the gelato since they had recently changed their menu, which is completely irresponsible behaviour for a restaurant. In addition, no one else other than our server came to check on the kids and ask if they were ok. I understand that this \"oversight\" was not malicious. But what came after sure seems like it. Just because the kids were ok doesn't absolve them from their ignorance nor their complete disregard for their customers' health and well being."}
{"text":"This is a great little place in Streetsville, if you're in the mood for some delicious authentic italian food this is the place to be. It's a small restaurant with a rustic charm and when it comes to pizza then won't be beaten easily. The fact that they have a wood burning oven already gives it a huge advantage, it reminds me of eating pizza in Florence. 

Thought the pizza's are great, you can't forget their meat and seafood dishes! Full of flavor and delicious! I would strongly recommend the Veal dish, very tender and delicious. If you're looking to try something new, the Octopus is fantastic. Soft and melts in your mouth, usually places ruin octopus and make it rubbery but these guys cook it to perfection. For dessert, the Tiramisu is a must! If you like strong coffee flavored tiramisu with some sweet whipped cream this is the one for you and in my opinion its the best Tiramisu in all of the GTA.

So after the raving review about the food why only 3 stars? The truth is service is a hit or miss. Sometimes I've had a great service and had a good laugh with the server. But other times I've had servers that messed up our orders even though it was a slow night or the food would take way to long to come out. If they could fix these issues I think they would be an even better restaurant."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like this place, since I love home made pizza and I love eating out. I've had a lot of great pizza, both in the GTA and in Italy itself! I went there with my family (four of us in total) and none of us were very impressed.

The first thing that went wrong was our table. We were squished right against an emergency exit door, and our table was so close to the one behind us that we could hardly move at all. We definitely weren't comfortable at all. We would have asked to be moved if it wasn't obvious that they were very busy and had no free tables. 

The menu had some nice choices, and we all ordered appetizers and pizza. The appetizers, mussels and calamari, were yummy, but the portions were extremely small. The problem was that both the appetizers and the pizza took extremely long to arrive at our table. I understand that fresh food takes a bit longer, but it was getting ridiculous how long we were waiting. And when we were waiting, our waiter was nowhere to be found! Finally, when the pizza arrived, it was all rather anticlimactic. The pizza was dry, the crust was bland, and the toppings tasted like they had just been dumped on top of the crust after the pizza had been done cooking. Considering that the pizzas were rather expensive, I expected much better. The portion sizes were good, but the pizza was disappointing.

We walked out of that restaurant having spent three and a half hours (and we aren't slow eaters, that time was mostly waiting), $200, and were ultimately disappointed.

Really wish this place was better. The good? The portion sizes and the atmosphere and the location. The bad? Everything else. If you do decide to go, make sure you have a reservation."}
{"text":"Never going back!! I do not recommend!
The pictures on here are very deceiving as well.
It was my birthday, no one sang, no one brought me over a dessert, it was very devastating.
I wanted a simple pizza - margarita, and I asked for mushrooms to be added.
I get my pizza, it's alright. Apparently I had to play hide and seek with the mushrooms...there were very few and tiny pieces scattered. I thought - whatever.
Then I get the bill...an extra $5 for the mushroom add-on.....excuse me?? I only found a few pieces here and there!
So speaking with the rude waiter, I explained there were hardly any mushrooms to begin with! It is just absurd costing $5 for barely anything.
Then him talking to me as if I was an idiot, he said he mischarged my $10 cocktail drink, and that it is a $12 drink, compensating the mushrooms to be $3 instead. Like no, I'm not a moron, that's still the extra $5.
Just horrible service and experience.

I'm also so happy I didn't order the tiramisu...I saw it made for someone - it was just a blob on a plate....not like the nice picture posted awhile ago on the yelp page."}
{"text":"Food was exceptional. Ingredients were so fresh and such simple yet amazing food. Tomato sauce ricotta proscuitto Outstanding. Service was excellent,they didn't hover over u but were attentive. Beautiful wine selection and even their house wine was delicious. Couldn't find a reason to fault them and I tried really hard. 
I can attest to the following : calzone stuffed with prosciutto and ricotta. Bf had the capo di cappi. Cappuccino and trio dessert of tiramisu cannoli and Gelato.  Wine: montepulciano. All in all a wonderful meal great ambiance. Hope they keep this up."}
{"text":"Eggplant parmigiana and the calamari were beyond amazing!!! Their margerita pizza had no cheese whatsoever and was kinda depressing even though the crust was delicious, their salmon pizza was plain too..
They have a very tasty seafood platter too."}
{"text":"Food was extremely good. However, restaurant was not well managed. Reserved a table for 8 many weeks in advance in grotto. Was placed at a table for 6 in a side room. Not even finished dessert and we were asked to vacate our table for another group of 14. A $550 dinner that disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here because we heard good things and are tired of Boston Pizza. It was a criminal rip off!!! I couldn't believe how expensive the pizzas are and everything in general. For nine people who ordered food we were charged $280 before tip. Three of these people were small children who only wanted a small serving of pasta or pizza. But they don't give you that option. So the kids have to order an adult sized plate for close to $20. This place isn;t fine dining. The pesto pizza I ordered was soggy and falling apart. A $22 personal pizza should be magic on your lips. 

Stay away unless you enjoy maying 5 star prices for a 1 star place."}
{"text":"Well I have been waiting for this place to open for a long time; well over a year since their signs went up. Finally got there tonight, and I have mixed feelings on it. 

The interior is nice, very dim and dark with fake candles throughout. However the room we were in kept having flickering issues on the fake chandelier which was a bit annoying.   Sinatra playing loudly on the speakers an appropriate choice no doubt for the theme of the resto.

Service was good, Kirk the server was affable, friendly and prompt. 

Wine by the glass was pleasantly affordable, multiple choices at $7 per glass 

Food is where I had to take some points away. Salads and appetizers are way too expensive IMO.  No salad was under $10 with many several dollars more. No homemade caesar salad on the menu is a borderline sin for a pizza place. Appetizers suffer the same pitfall, all $12 or more. 

Our grilled octopus app was a very small portion for the price, and a bit fishy tasting. Definitely not worth the price; see attached photos

Margherita pizza, I consider myself well versed in them. I order them EVERYWHERE I go, when offered. The one at Goodfellas had way too thick of a crust near the edges, which meant the thinner parts of the pizza were bitter with charring. The cheese was great, sauce was good but sparse. 

Wife's Taglietele al Funghi was delicious but very heavy. Very small portion again, but rich. Lots of delicious mushroom flavour.  Pasta nicely cooked, al dente. 

Long story short :  some hits, some misses with the food. Most items strike me as overpriced for the portions.  Affordable wine a big saving grace"}
{"text":"I tried all their food and nobody can make wood oven pizza like them.  I also recommend the bococini balls, grilled seafood and caprese salad. Ask them to give you the De Nigris 65% grape must. You're welcome! It's $40 a bottle at Starsky in case you're wondering.  Pair it with chianti or their dark beer on tap and you're good.  Stay away from their fish and steak.  They're not worth the money and you'll be left disappointed.  I only go there mostly for lunch.  But Rocco created a great spot in Mississauga if you are craving italian food.  Peace!"}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizza! A little tight inside but worth the wait! Amazing place with friendly staff and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"\"Just when I thought I was out......... they pull me back in\"

same goes for my healthy eating habits.... ugghhh pizza what are you doing to me 

Watching re-runs of The Sopranos doesn't help when all you want to do is eat !!! and only eat pizza and pasta... So I decided to dedicate a Sunday with the family and go for some good pizza..

MARONE!!!!! 

Did a quick search on wood oven pizza joints in sauga and this cute little place popped up... honestly the food was to die for but the service was outstanding!!!! (our waiter.. didn't get his name) was this sweet old Italian guy with the thick accent and the slicked back hair. Every time he twirled around the restaurant he would be singing songs from Italy... and poking at the kitchen and just keeping the atmosphere so friendly and heart-warming. 

I ordered the Diavolo pizza (Spicy) with sopressata, kalamata olives, different mushroom and sausage. Perfectly topped and not too cheesy.. it was made in the wood oven so it had that perfect crisp to it. Everyone else had similar pizzas and they all enjoyed it. Will totally be coming back to try other items... a bit on the pricey side but (Italian hand gesture) who cares it's soo fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place I have taken anyone I can to eat here. The atmosphere and the staff make for a great dining experience anytime of the day, but the food is what keeps me coming back. 

The pasta is fresh, filing and full of flavour and is one of my favourite places to go for when I need my pasta fix. 

But it's their pizza that just melts in your mouth and whisks you away to Europe. All fresh and cooked to perfection. 

If you are looking for a great place to eat this is it"}
{"text":"Shout out to the cute old man who was our server! He was naggy but in a way that only loving grandparents are... You know what I mean? He was all like \"Drink the water it's really good for you\", \"Finish your pasta, or at least take three more bites\" and \"You good? You need anything? You sure?\" Point being, he was attentive and kind and made our lunch a little more memorable. 

But imma be honest with y'all... while my pasta looked good, it didn't taste all that great. It was under seasoned and missing the truffle oil that the dish was said to have on the menu. However,the balsamic on the bread was phenomenal--I'm sure they brought a bottle in from Italy. 

Anyways, I'll probably give the pizza a try here sometime. But not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was our first time there. We came here because of the reviews online and because where I live we have a Goodfellas back home in Connecticut. When we walked in there was a very small wait. The hostess took people that  had been there after us and sat them first. (They didn't have a reservation) The waiter didn't ask us if we wanted appetizers although he asked the table behind us.  He also didn't ask if you wanted any beverages from the bar. The bread came and then about less than three minutes later the main courses came.  The waiter also never asked us how our food was or offer pepper or cheese for those who ordered pasta and our table in our party he also didn't offer if I wanted anything for the pizza I had to go and reach over to the table behind me to get the hot peppers. One person in our party had finished their beverage and he never asked if they wanted another one she had to ask him next time he came by. He never asked how our food was .The waiter was attending other tables but there was lots of other staff so I don't think that there was lack of staff as the table behind us was served by the same person and he was constantly over that I'm checking on how their meal was but not to us.  The food wasn't half bad. When the meal was over we waited over a half an hour for our check. When I realize that no one was coming I went over and mentioned that we were ready for our check. The waiter said he be right over with it, but then went on to make drinks and serve them at another table.   It was another ten minutes from the time I asked for the check to the time I received it. If it wasn't for the service we would definitely come back because the food was pretty good.  I would like to give this place a second chance but the people I went to dinner here with do not."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite restaurant in Mississauga. The service is always friendly, the atmosphere is romantic, the decor is beautiful and the food sublime. The prices are definitely appropriate for the quality of food. Their pizzas are truly delicious and I would highly recommend them! definitely a must-try spot in sauga"}

{"text":"I made a reservation online on Feb 11 and specified one guest (me) needs veg, dairy free and gf options. Nowhere on the site or during the booking did it mention that there would be a prix fixed menu for Valentine's. Today they texted me about the prix fixe menu and said they have gf pasta and pizza when I inquired.
When we arrived at the restaurant, only the prix fixe menus were at the tables. I spoke to the manager and told her I could have nothing on the fixed menu due to my restrictions. She allowed me to order off the regular menu which had some new options that I had noticed online. Hubby was forced to order off the regular menu with me as prix fixe is only if both of us order it.
Hubby started with the Arincini balls....they only gave him 2 as per the valentines menu but they brought another one when we said we were ordering from the regular menu. I had the fagioli (bean) salad which was delicious and not sour at all. I just took the crostini bread off.
Hubby ordered a calzone but found it too doughy and not a lot of filling. I had the risotto but requested it to be made with no dairy. The food took a really long time to arrive presumably because of my special request. It ended up very salty and strong tasting.....I did not like it. I even was willing to eat a little bread to get rid of the excess salty taste. First the server told me I had to order a whole loaf but then he agreed to just give me a few small slices. The bread was dry and bland....I just wasted the bread and part of the risotto.
We did not have dessert because hubby was full and nothing was suitable for me.
Sadly I was disappointed but the newer items on the menu looked good. Their gf pizza is not made in house and the crust is purchased outside and is a dry, flatbread type crust. Not appealing by the sounds of it."}
{"text":"I try not and eat chains but I drive past here often and stopped in to a charming Warm friendly atmosphere stocked with wood and wine - Figured I'd stop in early on a weekday and within minutes it was packed for supper - 

Prosecco and a Campari Negroni slipped down was a fun aspect which was quickly followed by Opened with light apps in the Dusted Calamari was fun light fare that disappeared off the plate amongst company and followed by Grilled Octopus which was succinctly charred softly in butter and was delightfully flavourful - and the Bruschetta was also quickly devoured and had me giddy for mains

Unfortunately The Welsh Lamb Shank was ever so slow cooked to a salty finish that I found hid the earthy flavour I like to savour in lamb I did sample some pasta and found it to have a more enjoyable consistency akin to what I'd expect from an Italian eatery 

Nonetheless - a rich fun midweek meal in what proved to be a very busy supper hour - the order to table time could be much improved so be armed with good conversation and company.  That said it may also be wise to make a reservation online in advance given the abstract popularity in streetsville"}
{"text":"We got four different pizzas, they were all very good but some were soggy on the bottom.  It is very very noisy.  Had a hard time hearing the conversation at our table, even had a hard time hearing the music.   Place is very busy.  But we really enjoyed the pizza.   Also enjoyed the Arancini."}
{"text":"This place was on the go to list by a recommendation from a friend for a year. Finally managed. Ambiance was nice. Busy busy. Made a quick reservation online. Seated promptly. 

Took nearly 10 min before we were served water. That's unacceptable. The waiter was quite preoccupied, busy I get it. But you have to be nice to customers and not ignore them. Someone took the wine I'd ordered as he told me as such he would make me a new one. My wife had specifically asked for a red sangria but got a white instead. When we asked him, we were made to feel as if we had ordered white first and now want red. To get a glass of sangria and one glass of house red wine took nearly 20 min. We had almost finished the first course. Reasoning? They had to make it again. They weren't complicated items. 

Food. The bruschetta. Large tomatoes, bread wasn't smoked, barely any flavour of garlic and strewn with a bunch of oregano? leaves. Why? Bleh. The arancini, again lacked any real omph or flavour. Nice sauce with em though. We ordered the Diavalo pizza. Now that was fantastic. Soft crust, folded, great flavour, good heat. At least the end was nice. Overall. If I do visit again, I'm just going for the ."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great. 
The service was great. 
Our server was so friendly and helpful. 
Very cozy atmosphere. 

Only thins is the  food was a bit bland. I love Italian but the arancini was dull and lacked flavor. The pizza was better."}
{"text":"Recently went there with a bunch of friends as this place was recommended for pizza. I was impressed with the ambiance when I walked in and had high hopes but little did I know, I was about to have the worst Pizza of my life! The overpriced Menu didn't have much to offer, on top of that, half of the pizzas on it weren't available. I ordered margarita as it is the world's easiest pizza to make but who knew I was about to eat a pizza that would taste as good as cardboard. Maybe cheese would have saved the day if they didn't go too stingy on it! The 3 miserable basil leaves also failed to add any colour to this round thing I refuse to call Pizza..

Anyways, stay away from this place unless you want a pizza that tastes as good as its box!"}
{"text":"Overall, good only in the context of Mississauga. Service was inattentive, and unapologetic about errors and missed items at more than our table. Food was great of your favourite haunt is Boston Pizza, but otherwise don't expect to be wowed. Also, if you roll with kids, even well behaved ones, try a different spot, they don't seem welcome here."}
{"text":"The best meal, ever !!!!! Went there tonight with a group of people. Fantastic service, friendly waiters, and THE BEST MEAL I have ever had ! Hands down, all the way ! Had the grilled seafood....enough for two people...and unbelievable ! I will be back...the pasta and pizza looked fantastic and this is on my list for next time ! Ciao"}
{"text":"I've been to Goodfellas a few times in the past few years with the most recent time being this weekend with family. I feel like the quality of their food has gone down since about a year and a half ago, which makes it hard for me to give this place 4 stars - their food is good enough but not amazing. 

Pros:
-The restaurant is obviously a beautiful one with stone walls, pretty light fixtures, nice dark wooden tables and a cute patio.
-There are various pastas and pizzas to choose from - no shortage here!
-I remember their picante party pizza being good (arugula, spicy calabrese soppressata) in terms of flavour and the lightness of the crust.
-Arancini balls were decent in flavour, portion and had a nice crisp to it.
-Their mushroom risotto was a good sized portion and had some good flavours.

Cons:
-The servers are not the warmest or friendliest...they're not rude but just not ones who seem to enjoy being there I guess? Maybe just my luck that this has been the case on each of my visits here. I've also found that it's a long period of time between seeing servers during the meal on each of my visits - even when it isn't packed to the max.
-The calamari tasted okay but disappointing that for $19, that you only get 6 pieces of squid (2 bite pieces) with breading that was in crumbles.
-The capricciosa party pizza (prosciutto, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, red peppers) was just okay. The crust was light and airy but we had a hard time finding the ingredients on the pizza - really stingy on the prosciutto in particular. 
-Depending on what you order, some of the food is pricy for what you get.

All in all, an okay dining experience. I base most of my reviews on the most important part: how the food tastes and again, the food we ordered was decent overall but it didn't wow me. I would be open to trying this place again and ordering other items on their menu in the future but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm reading the bad reviews and laughing how much they contradict themselves, small portion but I waited for doggy bag, had to wait cause it was busy but had to wait for the bill and it wasn't even busy, shit like that. Anyways, I came here and sat on the patio before my hair cut appointment and had lunch with my lady and the waiter could've been more pleasant but WTF do I care about a waiter as long as my food comes and drinks, which they did. Food was really good and portions were fine unless you're a fat fuck, my lady and I shared the calamari and pizza and we're full. Prices seemed reasonable too for hand made pizza which was crispy and chewy, charred and not burnt, mushrooms sauteed to give a deeper flavour. Overall I'd come back for sure, actually planning to on our next date night."}
{"text":"Cute little spot in Streetsville. Although the food was good considering it's a Mississauga Italian restaurant, the service was horrible. We were rushed through our meals and given the cheque before dessert came. The server was rude, snarky and probably needs to find another line of work since he clearly did not know how to handle customer service."}
{"text":"Expensive for the taste. Still not a bad option for people in this part of the city. 

Highly recommend the veal rice balls and the tiramisu. One tiramisu is good enough for 2. 

The veggie pizza with ricotta cheese was pretty ordinary with no inherent flavour. Too much bread and few toppings. 

My wife ordered the pesto pasta, that was good. 

Place is noisy and tight. Still charming though. The waiters love to talk and are friendly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service was beyond outstanding. Out waiter definitely understood what it means to be a waiter. The pizza was excellent and refreshingly outside the norm. Also the rice balls...mmm..."}
{"text":"A great little place in Streetsville. I've only been twice. but its honestly a great place with great ambience, food, and service. 

The pizza is a bit more on the \"sophisticated\" and \"elegant\" side. Not the place if you're looking for a generic pepporoni. 

Appetizers are tasty and generous. Its evident that all food here is of great quality."}
{"text":"Well at least the place was open this time:)

Goodfellas is an attractive spot in a good location and the service was quick, friendly and professional.

The veggie pizza that followed the supposed fan favourite Arancini Balls was fine but hardly remarkable which makes it difficult to understand why they are packed every night.

Maybe they are kings in the small Streetsville pond and that's enough."}
{"text":"Pizza tasted just like the pizza in Italy. Little dry and crispy. I guess I'm more fond of the North American style. I had calamari and it was good. Not too battered and not too chewy and came with cocktail sauce. I liked the vibe a lot, seemed like we were downtown and this was on a weeknight. Very live and staff seemed on point. I should mention the table next to us had terrible service as we had our dessert before they got their apps and we came in the same time. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Great gem in a nearby neighbourhood. Pizza is amazing!!
The ambiance equally amazing."}
{"text":"Food & Great service!!! One of the best pizzas i've ever had. Atmosphere was quiet & romantic as well!"}
{"text":"I wont go back. The food was OK. I'm saying Ok because we were 6 people with 6 different meal. two of them were good, One of the dishes was horrible, and last one was OK. I should say there were vegetarian  dishes, so this restaurant is not good for its veggie dishes. Anyhow, I like the environment, but I wont go back because food is more important than the environment."}
{"text":"$19 for a Caprese Salad was a bit expensive but it was worth every bite.
The cheese was like butter.
And the pesto drizzled at the side was out of this world"}
{"text":"ok so i was super excited to try this place. i love pizza and italian food overall so here goes:

service: scattered. we arrived on time for a reservation..and were sent away because our table wasnt ready yet. then when we came back..they said the table still wasnt ready yet because they thought we ran off...ok...? we were quickly seated after that and by the window which was nice because of the breeze. throughout the course of the meal we were served by 3 different people. at one point we were told in a panic by the owner that they were short staffed so to be patient. it was all just strange the restaurant was not that busy and we were not in any rush to order. additionally the kitchen was right behind us literally lol they could have just passed us the pizza. SO STRANGE

anyway FOOD: i ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza after being told that the type of pizza i wanted  (piccante pizza) was only for the 2 ppl sized pizza not a personal size... once again..strange but thts fine. my pizza came. it was mediocre..the middle was kind of soggy and the crust extremely dry. salty (to be expected with prosciutto) but i found it just bland even with the arugula. i actually had to ask for hot sauce which i felt sad about lol

i tried my friends pesto pasta and amatriciana both were delish. my friends also ordered margherita which looked good but i didnt taste. we got cannolis for dessert and they were so amazing. 

Overall i would go back and try a different pizza only because i want to really like this place. but for a pizza priced at $15 i only ate half and wasnt satisfied at all."}
{"text":"Before you go in, make sure to reserve or you will have to wait for like 45 mins. I went with a friend for the first time in the evening. We didn't reserve so we waited for 45 mins. After long waiting, we were wondering why they didn't call to notify when the table is ready for us. So we went back in and the table was already waiting for us. 

They gave us a table which was so close to the entrance door of the small room. It was so upsetting because I kept getting bumped by the waiters when they walked in between the two tables. *Sigh* they have poor seating arrangements. However, the atmosphere wasn't too bad in the small room. 

We ordered Quattro Stagioni and Calzone Napoletano. It was fast when they served us (I think it's because there were two of us only and they wanted to serve us at the same time). Both looked good and delicious. I quite liked Stagioni because it looked so tempting - 4 different kinds - roasted red peppers, prosciutto, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms. The portion is not too small and just okay for the price. 

Overall, it's the best wood oven Italian pizza I had ever tried in Mississauga/Streetsville so far. I will definitely come back again to try other pizza choices and also the pasta. 

4 stars for the pizza. 3 stars for the seating arrangements."}
{"text":"First time we visited!
Great Calamari
Awesome Rice balls
Pizza are yummy but heavy
No choice for kids
Pasta red sauce was yummy
Will go back again but without kids"}
{"text":"I had to take my boyfriend to this place while we were visiting Canada, as it's one of my favs! We got the Arancini Siciliani for an appetizer, followed by the Tagliatelle ai funghi e tartufo and Picante pizza. DEEEELISH! My boyfriend fell in love with the pasta and said the truffle oil and flavoring of the mushrooms were excellent. The pizza was authentic and just what I craved. The arancini is very different from most Italian places and definitely a larger portion. Overall, I will always come back when I visit and get the chance! NYC has amazing food and this is definitely a contender for that market."}
{"text":"Went for the first time 2 weeks ago and I loved the food! Especially the grilled octopus and the arugula prosciutto pizza. Our waiter was also very attentive and funny."}
{"text":"not so good... but not that bad.
cozy atmosphere, friendly waitress.
pizza was good.
house wine is good.
but otherwise so so."}
{"text":"After reading all of the negative reviews, both in person and online, I was definitely hesitant to celebrate my birthday here. However, I absolutely loved it. I had the margarita pizza and my boyfriend had a Tagliatelle ai Funghi e Tartufo (had to look that one up!) and the food was delicious. One complaint was that the service was definitely a little slow, as the waiter hardly ever came by our table, and that where we were sitting it was rather cold! But if you're looking for authentic Italian food, I would recommend here in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"Good food, great location! (though it's hard to find parking in the Streetsville area). I came by with 3 of my friends on a Tues night for 7pm. I made reservations because I know this place gets busy real fast. I was right, got really busy around 730-8pm and the restaurant was filled with people. The first time I came here we were seated near the oven, this time we were on the right side; super far in. I didn't even know it extended that far! Ambiance of this place is nice and the decor matches the italian theme. 
I ordered the preset menu which right now goes for $50/pp. Prices change every year so you'd need to double check with your server the next time you go. I wanted to try a little bit of everything so that's why I got preset instead of one dish. 

Rice balls - amazing!! it came with 3 large rice balls and it was stuffed with beef, cheese, and peas covered with pasta sauce and a side of salad.
Bolognese - decent, I would have preferred the pasta a little more softer but I didn't mind it. I got really full from the rice balls that I had this for lunch the next day.. which actually tasted better after I heated it up hah.
Tiramisu - made in house and this was REALLY good. The cake was soft and fluffy and it was a decent size too! I had to share that with my friend, I wouldn't have been able to finish that myself.
Prosecco - normal.
Cappucino - good and smells really strong. I like my coffee sweet so I added more sugar to it. 

Service was great! good was great! Would come back again on occasion."}
{"text":"I am generally not a complainer, but I found little bits of what I thought was plastic in my appetizer calamari. They told me it was little bits of cartridge, but I can't be sure. I should have kept a piece.  I know it was very chewy and hard to swallow.  

The pizza was good, but I wouldn't say the best I've ever had. Atmosphere was good. Service was good."}
{"text":"Second time here. Every choice on the menu seemed to either be false advertised or non existent. Arugula Salad advertised with blood orange. Regular oranges in the salad. Spezzatino not in stock, lamb spedini taken off the menu. Half litres of wine not available why?!?!

Unless you want pizza or 4 types of pasta don't bother. Thoroughly disappointed tonight folks.

To top it off arugula salad had a massive long hair in it. I didn't make a scene I just quietly showed our waiter who quickly whisked it away. Any comps? Nope! Date night ruined grazie."}
{"text":"Driving through Streetsville with the blonde and stopped for lunch. We were seated on the patio. Service was quick and friendly. Our server Chris was fantastic. We split the Arancini Siciliano (rice balls). Delicious, cheesy and crispy. The Marinaio pizza was life altering. Grilled octopus, squid prawns and mussels done perfectly. Just the right amount of spice and a fantastic thin crust. 
We'll come back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant twice now.  Both times with our young daughter (she's 18 months now). The first time we visited was a weeknight and wasn't overly busy.  We went because my hubby was craving pizza that didn't come from a box/mass production line.  We never dreamed that they wouldn't have high hairs.  Major fail in my books.

This weekend, we had family visiting that wanted to go to a non-franchise restaurant with some personality.   Goodfella's came up.  I was pleasantly surprised at the high chairs this time.  Apparently the owners/management realised that they were missing a lot of business by not being family friendly. We went in arpund 5 pm (because of our daughter) and the place was full of families.  Understandably,  the clientele will change as the night goes on, but families exist in Streetsville! And we like to go out for non-chain dinners too! 

I have mixed feelings about the staff but apparently I'm super picky when it comes to this.

The only complaint we had about the food was that I'm pretty sure the gelato is ice cream (as per our Italian family).  And I'd really love a nice caeser salad. Other than that, 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Here is my short review of GoodFellas-Streetsville location

Got to the place for 7:30 as we had reservations, it was extremely busy. First 15 minutes we were like, ok its probably because its busy. We ended up waiting 45 minutes in a crammed hallway. Another group of 4 had come in 35 minutes after we had arrived and had been seated right away, they had no reservations. I hate to pull the race card, but we are a family of colour and the group was an italian group....just saying'

45 minutes later we got seated, got our food, it was good but not amazing. Waiter and all the staff was very nice  as well

We had:

-Rice balls (excellent appetizer)
-pizza with sausage on it (it was good, but a little salty)-main course

Nonetheless, great little place, very busy, service needs to be worked upon, and a little pricey."}
{"text":"My friend and I were warmly greeted. Even when we changed our minds from sitting outside to inside the hostess did not make a fuss about it.

We ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza with sliced Parmesan Reggiano, fresh cherry tomatoes, and buffalo mozzarella. It about $20 and took a bit on the longer side to come out to our table. It was very tasty, despite on my side it was very burnt on the crust.

The food was great but the service sucked. Our waiter barely paid attention to us as he passed by to serve our tables. We had to constantly wave him over to get our waters filled. He was favouring the neighbouring table because they were being chummy with the pizza maker and speaking Italian. Maybe that's why my pizza was extra burnt.

I should learn how to speak Italian I guess to get better service.

I give this place 3.5 stars."}
