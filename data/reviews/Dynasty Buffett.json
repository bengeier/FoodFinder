{"text":"Decent food served hot. Small, but not cramped. Best in Gastonia, way better than NY hibachi next door."}
{"text":"Have to say that this isn't bad at all!! Many items and they keep it pretty fresh!! I eat Chinese buffets all over the country and this is in the top 15 of the better ones I've been in!!"}
{"text":"It's all about that lunch menu price tho.  Dynasty is a Gastonia Staple.  You know what you're getting into before you even walk in.  Is it the top level fusion asian palace on the east coast?  No, and i'm not looking for that.  But for 5 bucks during lunch, (this price may have changed) I am walking in hungry and leaving happy and faded on that pleasant yet slightly paranoia inducing cloud of monosodium glutamate.  Knowing that unlike most aspects of society I got exactly what I paid for...dinner time pricing is a different story."}
{"text":"It's descusting NY buffet was really good and now closed.I don't see how anyone can stand to eat here food is old and cold and not even worth 6$"}
{"text":"The food seems to have been on the buffet for quite a while. eggrolls weren't crispy, nor was any thing else that should have been crispy.  The rest of the food wasn't horrible, and the service was decent.
The cost for myself and my daughter (who is 11.) was $19.93
Which seemed a bit much considering I got water and it was lunchtime!
There is a buffet down the road which also has sushi and chinese and it was much cheaper....and much tastier, I might add."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. So selection. Alot of poor attempts of American food and sushi is disgusting. Would never waste another $6 there."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place got low reviews. Just ate here and everything was hot, fresh, and delicious. Deserts were in individual serving sizes for convenience. My favorite was the teriyaki chicken. Tender chicken with great flavor. My wife's favorite was the extra large crab ragoons. 

Only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating was that they were not serving from the Hibachi grill because it was before 4:00. 

Good food at a fair price"}
{"text":"I'm not big on either chinese or buffets, but this place isn't bad at all. Very clean and lots of good people."}
{"text":"CarolynShuford. loves it 
.wish I could come lot more often...I hope  to get back there will soon ..love it ....the only trouble ii have when I finish my first plate. it's  often empty where I want  more .
B UT   I just find more. SusI   an I'm happy ...."}
{"text":"Very clean and great staff. The food is really good as well. The price will not break the bank, which is great for families. I would highly recommend this to anyone in gastonia. Do not forget the hibachi grill..it's great"}
{"text":"$6.99 lunch with so many varieties with seafood where can you find.
If you're 60, you even get a discount. . I really enjoy eating there with friends with whom, we have different preference, I only eat vegetable, fish and chicken, a friend doesn't eat meat but seafoods, this is prefect place for us."}
{"text":"Average buffet, but they have a true Hibachi (evenings), where you fix your own plate and give it to the grill cook to cook for you. There are several flavors of sauces to choose from for your hibachi. And compared to any buffet, the hibatchi will be hot and fresh! Best of both worlds! The interior is worn but hopefully they will move soon, up by road where the Ryan's than,  NY Buffet closed. They have a sign on the building. I've been to some other buffets where all the food tasted the same, bland flavor, the now closed Micki Chows comes to mind. This food is better than that. Salad bar, dessert bar, sushi bar. Enough variety that everyone should be able to find something they like. Pepper frogs legs I like, my wife likes the slice your own roasted beef. Staff has always been nice and quick to remove used plates. I'd say they are holding their own in a small town with lots of other oriental spots. It gets lots of business, probably because of their reasonable pricing and the food is fair, average and not horrible.  Don't try to compare this where you'd buy a dinner plate that is served to you hot, freshly cooked, that wouldn't be fair. I've never had cold food that was supposed to be hot. They do a good job keeping the buffet dishes fresh and to temp, but as most buffets it won't be hot like a single serve plate brought out to you."}
{"text":"First time have tried this restaurant since they moved. Overall food was tasty and the selection was really good. Only major problem we seen was that the cooked foods were not \"hot\"! They were just warm. This was throughout, because between my wife and myself we tried most everything. Price was good and the dessert bar was very good. Waitress kept our drinks full and table policed. Need to really turn up the heat across the board. Food is safer and taste much better when served at the correct temperature !"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me by some coworkers who said it's the best chinese buffet in the gastonia/west Charlotte area.  Unfortunately after trying it out I did not agree with them.  This place is just a typical sub-par chinese buffet.  They have a decent variety of entrees to choose from (including crab legs and other random seafood including little raw octopuses) but the quality of the food wasn't great.  They also have some basic sushi rolls on the buffet but the freshness and quality was definitely questionable.  I tried a couple pieces of a california roll because I can't resist sushi, but it was pretty bad.  Dynasty buffet is good if you're looking for a cheap buffet with plenty of options, but don't expect the quality to be outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. 7.99 for the buffet lunch and I wasn't even able to sample everything before I was full. They have a wide variety of foods for everyone. The place looks immaculate. Their sanitation rating is 95 which is damn good. I love the way they did their Crab Rangoon with the honey in it. So good. There were a couple things I didn't think tasted that good, but they were very fresh so no issues there. They have a Hibachi grill that looks amazing and a very extensive sushi bar for all your sushi needs. They have everything you could possibly want and more and I will for sure be coming back here often.

If you're looking for an affordable Chinese buffet in Gastonia... I wouldn't even bother with anywhere else. This place is heaven for the Chinese food fanatic."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a really good Chinese buffet since we relocated to North Carolina, and we've always been disappointed...until we tried this place. It's got a very good variety, the food is very good, it's clean, and the service employees are very friendly and attentive. It's a pretty good drive from where we live in Denver, but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Had lunch @ Dynasty 7Dec in their NEW location. Still in Franklin Square in the front. Building clearly marked. Scratch and forget all the other reviews. This is brand new location. Yesterday second day there. They really out done themselves imo. The place is awesome with several new items on buffet. Very clean and I always get Candy if she's working. Best service and food.

Only thing I hate, but figured it had to happen. Price went up for buffet and water from 6.36 to 7.47 inc. tax."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese buffet. We enjoy a lot of the items on the buffet. Decent Hibachi Grill and sushi. They moved to a bigger location which is nice. Service has always been good. Nice desert bar with ice cream bars and cups in it."}
{"text":"The outside could be cleaned up for appearance purposes. If the outside looks like a trailer park I wonder what the kitchen looks like. The carpet is filthy and reeks of high traffic. The doors are cloudy glass that were never upgraded from when it was another buffet years ago. When you open the doors the inside doesn't match the outside. They upgraded the inside of the building-- too bad they don't know how many people judge a book by its cover and lucky for them we are greedy lol. Once we came in the restaurant is typical Chinese buffet with typical buffet food. Average Chinese food buffet style- what else can I say. Just close your eyes when you pull up. The outside will turn you away."}
{"text":"First time visit , food was on point , great service and family friendly !! The food  bars are setup with a wide variety for something for everyone  will be revisiting in the future !!"}
{"text":"I only come here on Christmas mostly because my wife forces me too. We take her cousin out for lunch. The only memorable thing about this restaurant is the little hoodsie cups of ice cream. The food is remarkably unremarkable. It's a case of it is what it is cheap average Chinese food."}
{"text":"very bad attitude, I kept going for the convenience and the price but seems like the more I attended the more they got 'comfortable' and the less service we received.....we leave good tips out of respect but they never deserve it..."}
{"text":"My hubby and I eat here every Saturday night and I am waiting for him here right now! The food is delicious and I especially like the seafood items. I do get nervous in the buffet line because other customers and staff are overcrowding me . I need space to move so I can fill up my plate with more food than I can possibly eat!  I love the new building especially the water wall that is so mesmerizing! I look forward to Saturday night so we can eat at Dynasty Buffet again!"}
{"text":"Great, for vegetarian endless supply of vegetables. Also great supply of meat and seafood for the carnivore...Prices change between lunch and dinner but their selection also changes I noticed frog legs at dinner."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great. My daughter and I were passing through from Charlotte to Hickory and thought we'd give this place a chance. Glad we did! Sushi bar, Hibachi grill and buffet- all good!"}
{"text":"The quality and price of this restaurant is excellent for a buffet. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Not an awesome chinese but it is the best in Gastonia. Consistent good food and service. Not too expensive like the other gastonia chinese buffett. You cant go wrong"}
{"text":"Over the past 5 years, Ive sporadically tried this place about 8 times. Only 1 time did I find it decent. Even though they are fairly busy, most of their food tastes and/or looks old. My family is not going back."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened but this place went down hill real bad.  We just went there the other night because passion grill was closed.  When we walked in the front entrance/foyer it was so dirty that I almost turned around.  Then I open the 2nd set of doors, and there were crumbs and food all on the floor.  Why I stayed is beyond me.  The food was horrible!  Dried out, no flavor, and cold!  Waitress was not attentive to our table at all.  There was 7 of us, and any time we needed a refill on drinks she was no where to be found.  Not sure if there are new owners, but this large party will not be returning any time soon!"}
{"text":"I eat here on the regular I enjoy the Sushi sometimes
The food is in between not delicious but no very disgusting..Lunch and Dinner they also do takeout call in your order and it will be ready in a flash I can't really recall a bad experience here."}
{"text":"We LOVE the Dynasty buffet! Great variety of food choices and the atmosphere makes you feel very comfortable. The staff is always friendly and the prices are fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the selection was fantastic. However, my husband has been throwing up this evening and has food poisoning symptoms. This was the only place we ate today. Beware."}
{"text":"Really good food! Just moved to the Charlotte area and had to find a good Chinese restaurant, and i will definitely return to This one."}
{"text":"Not bad, but pretty much your generic buffet. A lot of the menu items are good for what they are. The seaweed salad is good, kimchi is good, baby octopus salad is good, the sauteed crab is good.

The hibachi grill is pretty good for if you want something freshly cooked. 

The wontons are good, the crab ragoons are good, the mushrooms are good.

A lot of it is as good as generic asian takeout.

The sushi is hit or miss. They had eel which was nice, but all the other nigiri was either poorly cut  or had been out to long, as it was dry and flavorless. The tuna is thats what it was, was some of the worst I've ever and I've had pretty good at some buffets. I guess they don't sell enough sushi here or something to justify investing it. 

Still a good place to go to spend time with family and to get a value for price meal.

So I reccomend."}
{"text":"Quite a few steam tables here at Dynasty and they were doing a great job of keeping them fresh and filled during the lunch rush. Even with most of the tables filled and a lot of people coming and going, the buffet was kept quite clean.

Sushi was meh with a small selection and nothing especially creative. The rice was not the right kind but they were certainly trying.

Service was excellent. \"Candy\" did a super job of keeping drinks filled and being friendly while she cleared our dirty plates."}
