{"text":"absolutely great bar! i've heard its the same owner as common wealth downtown and it shows. has the same old timey, speak easy vibe. bartenders were fun and interactive."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this place and the neighboring restaurant as the service is hit or miss - but more often than not is a miss.  Food is great and they share a kitchen so you can choose your desired ambience.  Other place has live music and a Bloody Mary bar - so that can definitely edge it out, but the service makes it difficult to give it more than 3 stars for either.  Staff don't seem to know the menu - or at least the one item that is a daily - the biscuit of the day.  Felt like we were inconveniencing them when we asked additional questions, but I know we were a larger group and difficult.  Have attended brunch here 3x over the past 3 months and 2x at the other.  Happy hour service was better (in case you are on the fence) and with the outdoor seating and location - waiting a few extra minutes for delicious food isn't the worst!"}
{"text":"Decor is interesting... Whimsical artwork, Victorian English style.   Choice of beer was good... Service was terrible!!!  Sat in the middle of the bar... Not crowded, about 10 people in the place. The bar tender spent the whole time we were there with an obnoxious crowd at the end on the bar.  Finally got served by a bar back.   Won't be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Really liked this bar and the new \"vibe\" it has from its previous concept. Service was great and the drink selection is adequate. The deviled egg appetizer is a must have."}
{"text":"Thank you, Henderson for finally stepping up the rad game.  Although it's only \"soft opened\", Due and Proper tantalized my taste buds and put a little sparkle in my eye.  The service was great, the decor was hip and sexy with dark accents and delish chandeliers creating a nice ambiance.  Also the outdoor seating is great and way hard to find in this desert.  Thank you for not being Applebee's or another chain.    We enjoyed the deviled eggs first---well done! These were light with a nice bite.  So tasty.  Next we had the buttermilk chicken sliders....also fantastic.  The buns were soft and fresh and the chicken moist and juicy with some nice spice on the side.  They have some nice libations to offer and decent beers on tap but could step up that game a bit.  Sorry for revealing your awesomeness even though your sign out front said not to just yet.  I just couldn't take it anymore. Keep up the quality and service and this will be THE spot!  Can you add a scotch egg to the menu? Please and thanks and maybe add no smoking.  :-)"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere!! Our bartender, Wendy, was the best!! The food service was a little slow, but the food was amazing...they treated our group well. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"First and LAST time visiting this establishment! Terrible service, terrible Management, Terrible Organization skills! I had such high hopes that were dashed, after 30 minutes we finally received our first round of drinks. Took the server 20 minutes to tell us they were out of Hendricks gin, and also that they did not carry Tanqueray.   After an hour and a half we left starving!  We talked to a child like manager, who did not even offer to rectify any mistakes. By the way, we had not even seen this so-called manager in the hour and a half we were waiting for food and drinks. How is it that place is like Applebee's and chilies a manager will come up to you at least once a meal and ask you how the services. I would expect better from A seemingly class your restaurant at the District.   We left starving and disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a great time Saturday morning here, the bartender was great and the atmosphere is awesome!!!! They were serving brunch although I wish I could of got more lunch food so that's the only reason for four stars.  My husband and I really enjoyed hanging out here and the decor is really cool we will definitely be back for happy hour and a big spin of the wheel!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but very small menu! Extremely overpriced beer and wine.  Also very unfortunate to pay so much ($6 for a coors light) to then go to the women's restroom to find no toilet paper and trash on the floor.  We come to the district to get off the strip, but the prices won't bring me back."}
{"text":"The food I ordered was exceptionally good; a grilled cheese sandwich made with goat cheese and a fig jam.  The service from the bartender was excellent and I made it back to my office, on time.  I was  in on another occasion and couldn't get waited on- but I would still go back.  Their menu is unique and well-presented."}
{"text":"Nice decor and neat little bar,  Might have been the worst happy hour beer selection I have ever seen though.  Service was good but when you only serve a bad domestic (Coors Light) for happy hour pricing to me that is way too limited.  Blue Moon and Stella $ 8.00 at Happy Hour.  Really don't think the new owners understand clientele in Henderson.  Again love the service and the bar but won't return and I live right across the street.  It was much better as Al's Garage.  ."}
{"text":"Super fun bar. We were there on a Saturday night, and it was really busy. The place is not very big but has a great atmosphere.  Super dark with some cute/creepy pictures on the wall and red chandeliers.  The tables and lounge area looked great, but we weren't able to get a seat there. We did get a seat at the bar though.   The bartenders were all great. It was busy but they kept up with no issues at all. Super friendly and interactive but not excessively so. I drank wine, which was great, but my husband was drinking craft cocktails and shots and felt everything was great. We also got an order of the Pikes fries that come with chili, cheese and a fried egg on top. They were quite good."}
{"text":"Let's just start off with the bathrooms, I've seen filthy vagrants at Sunset Park keep a cleaner bathroom then this dump. I used to frequent this establishment when it was Al's Garage, then they slapped up some wallpaper and paint to bandage this eye sore. You should of spent some money fixing up these bathrooms, they're disgusting and always overflowing. Next, this is supposed to be a pub right? Why is it when I ordered a Moscow Mule I was served in a plastic cup and it was made with lemon juice, vodka and soda water? If I'm paying $11 a drink, pay a mixologist to teach your god damn bartenders to make a frigging drink. Keep this dump, I'm over it, they should of just made it a PTS Pub!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service. Had the corned beef sandwich special for St. Patty's Day and it was delicious with my ice cold frosty beer. The only \"ding\" to this review is the waffle fries that came with the sandwich: They were stone-cold so we ordered the tater tots instead...(did you read that Due & Proper? Cold waffle fries no bueno!) The tots were a winner however! . Overall, a solid place to go for bar food, cool ambiance and hopefully no cold food in the future...please!"}
{"text":"Do Not Eat Here, unless you want Food Poisoning! That is what my friends and I got when we ate the pulled pork sliders here Friday night, just barely recovering come Sunday!"}
{"text":"Decided to try since I was in the area. No one was seems to tending the bar, but people were there. Sat myself at a table, waited almost 10 min before the bartender said she was the only one working there. Felt a little bad she was by herself, but she took my order and it took a while before the food came out. Food was good. Had the Hangover Burger and fries. Would of ordered a drink, but seems like she was in a hurry to do something else. Might come back to give another try, but kinda disappointed in the I-dont-eant-to-be-here service. Cool decor though."}
{"text":"Bad service!! Went there for a birthday gathering and at first thought it was a good venue. Set up was modern and had good vibe.   There wasn't a cocktail waitress so we had to go up to the bar to order our drinks. Once at the bar everyone behind the bar would look at you and wouldn't attend to you with a sense of urgency, more so like they were better than you. Wasn't just me it was the whole group of us who felt the bad service.   Along with bad service they charged my card on someone else is tab and that was such an inconvenience. And the bartender told me after the fact he swiped my card for my actual tab. Didn't even accommodate me what so ever.  For a local spot I would think they'd have better service... Not at all. DO NOT GO TO THIS BAR!!"}
{"text":"This is a great bar. Due and Proper exudes twisted Victoriana. Sadly tonight the music sucked. If I want to hear rap I can go to a club on the strip but it seemed so out of place here, lyrically F**k N****r does not fit the theme.  Service was great as usual and I hope this is now not the fit musically for this establishment.  Normally I would give this place 5 stars. It was a one drink night for me."}
{"text":"This review is a little overdue. What can I say, life happens.  I walked in with my lady friends, the fire alarm goes off. Don't smell a fire, don't see evidence of one. The employees are just as clueless as we are. I figure, let's sit down until the fire brigade kicks us out, and get a cocktail until then. It's not like the staff were doing much, we sat with the fire alarm, for ten minutes.  Finally, I said very loudly, \"what do I have to do to get a drink here, start a fire?\" As a joke of course. The staffer came over, and handed us cocktail menus; I didn't want to wait ten minutes to order so I did the shiny object trick to keep her there while my friends decided what to drink.  Now, you'd think we'd get a free drink or a free appetizer for not being scared off by the alarm. When it finally went off there were only three other patron groups hanging around. Nothing free, not even a \"thank you\" for sticking it out.  I won't even go in to dinner. Friends got the flatbread. Each a different kind. One of them got food poisoning the next day. It wasn't the one that ordered the veggie flatbread. I got the sliders. Meh, okay. Nothing that makes them Due And Proper's. The loaded tots... Come on, they're potatoes, which are cheap. If you're going to charge a high price, include a bit bigger serving.  I'd go back just for the decor. I'll stick with vodka ginger."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Sliders comes with fries and good craft beer specials. Some different things on tap from the ordinary."}
{"text":"Poor service.  They game me raw calamari, I could still see the batter.  Messed up our order twice. Slow to get our drinks."}
{"text":"8$ for freaking Stella Artois? 18$ for a flank steak of a few ounces and some frozen waffle fries? Oh wait it gets better, in the middle of the eating our server presents the check, we didn't get why since we wanted to stay more and grab a few more beers so we had to tell her to take it back. Anyway never again, rip off!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 4.5  Went here for the happy hour on a Thursday around 5:30pm, it was a little dead inside. The happy hour menu was light, not a ton of options but was happy with what we got. My group ordered 'The son and the man' which was sweet and refreshing as well as the 'Strongbow Spritz' which was wonderful, has a great bitter taste at the end of it. I had a beer on their happy hour but then couldn't help myself and also ordered the 'Dead Rabbit'(not on happy hour)  which I thought was wonderful. It was full of flavor, very fun and different. I loved the cinnamon with the carrot juice!  For food the only thing we had on happy hour was the beef sliders which were amazing!  Came with three which was perfect. We also ordered the pretzels which were as good as pretzels go and also the mediterranean flat bread which was fantastic, I will be going back just for that.  The place is dark and fun pictures on the walls. There are tvs and looked like some video poker at the bar. They did have a nice little patio as well. Overall I was very happy here, and will be coming back. I love their other property they have 'Park on Fremont' which is my favorite bar in Las Vegas, this place isn't as great as Park but it is so close to home that I know I will end up here often!"}
{"text":"Yelp removed my previous review on this ridiculous establishment because *someone* felt That my review personally attacked the bartender... Which it did... Because the bartender was rude and I feel that I have a right to state that. The staff is a large part of what makes an establishment and if the staff is offensive, I think I should be able to explain the situation. Anyways... Here is my review again, without an explanation as to why I felt the bartender was so rude and disrespectful:: Really disappointed by this spot. Whist, next door, is awesome. This place however was disgraceful and I wish I had spent my birthday at whist. Due and proper was full of rude and disrespectful employees. Our waitress was very rude towards our table and showed no interest in serving us. The second our group walked in she treated us with disrespect, despite us all being polite towards her and tipping very well on the first round of drinks... If you don't like big groups then a bar isn't the place for you to work....and our bartender was on a crusade to kill anybody's good time. My group of friends and I were there on my bday to have a good time. It was killed as soon as the bartender walked through the door. The place died early in the night (on a Saturday) and I can name ten other bars within a ten mile radius that you would have more fun and would have had better service than this one. Dont waste your night. Every cocktail I tried was disgusting and the disrespectful bartender was completely inexcusable. I will never waste my time bringing my friends to this spot again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cocktail bar in Henderson. I come here for happy hour (weekdays until 7 pm) and order the Butcher or a wine. When it's not happy hour, the Natives is my drink of choice. I love it so much I'm learning to recreate it at home. Due & Proper gets busy, so service isn't always speedy, but everyone is friendly. The quirky decor inside is great, and the outdoor picnic tables are perfect when it's nice out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is amazing ... But it isn't as amazing as the staff. These people are visibly working hard to satisfy us patrons. Our server, Mary, is so knowledgable of the menu and her attitude is out of this world: kind, funny, smart, and pretty. Management did a great job hiring this diamond."}
{"text":"They only will comp a drink if your playing $2.50 a push.....I think not  That's ok, I won't be back.  Good luck"}
{"text":"A great bar in a great area, Due and Proper offers a really cool old school themed bar with delicious food and solid service.  My friends had a slew of different drinks, liking just about all of them.  My girlfriend ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and I had chicken sandwich sliders.  Portions were good, and prices were reasonable for a bar in the District.  Not super cheap but definitely affordable.  I'd like to try more of the menu next time.  Our server was always making sure we were taking care of, and she had a pleasant attitude.    The interior, like I said, has an old-school feel.  Booths, old-timey chairs, and some unique artwork make the place feel more original and less like some generic bar.    Plus, plenty of TVs to watch your favorite sports games.  I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"I always have a good time here. They are great for late nights with groups of friends. The service is super good and very friendly. It's a very relaxed environment but the food and drinks are good enough to be served in a more formal place.   My favorite things:  Warm Pretzel Sticks- so delicious and super good when you've been drinking. And they come with a cheese sauce that is to die for. I'd swim in it.   Irish Nachos- as if nachos weren't delicious enough. These nix the chips and are made with waffle fries. And the cheese is legit melted cheese, not that fake nacho cheese poser. Super good to share and if you're feeling selfish, I could definitely eat these all myself.   My one complaint is the sometimes, depending on the bartender the cocktails can be inconsistent. The same drink will taste completely different another time. But for the most part, this place is fantastic.   Try it for a chill night out with friends. It's a good time."}
{"text":"Girls Monday brunch! Finally able to find a nice spot that serves mimosas on a Monday morning! Love this place! Service is wonderful and the food is delicious! Coming back for these bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance in this place! So different from boring dive bars. The drinks are so unusual but a roller coaster ride for your palate! A tad pricey, but not bad at all. Love the new guy, Matt! He's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last week.  Had an amazing burger and great service on the patio.  There were three of us and we wanted to talk and it was a bit noisy inside, but really cool artwork  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"If you're on a budget but wants to unwind, this place is it. The ambiance is nice, and crowd noise is tolerable. Their pulled pork sandwich is really good."}
{"text":"Where is management! Puke under tables, women's bathroom horrible, smell, glasses in sink.... yes it's only 9:00 pm. Stay away! No class"}
{"text":"First time here and we were looking to try some great new food. Our server was very attentive and took great care of us. Ordered the Irish nachos, chicken sliders, and bangers & mash. Let's talk about the sliders... I know these are small portions to start but the chicken on these things is no bigger than a piece of popcorn chicken at best. It had great flavor, but after the first bite I was just eating the bun. Irish nachos pale in comparison to the nachos at McMullans and are more expensive. There's really nothing special about them. The bangers and mash were okay but for $16, it would be nice to get more than a 1/4 cup of mashed potatoes. And it comes covered in a red wine reduction that was overbearing. Overall.. The theme was interesting, nice server, but business was dead (on a Wednesday so that doesn't say much) and the food just isn't worth the price paid."}
{"text":"Not impressed- Very dark, slow service and food was and menu not worth returning for.  The wings were dry, the nachos were blah.  I miss al's."}
{"text":"I miss this place already.  Heard they are about to close forever but it was always great and Corbin was the best bartender! Hopefully he goes somewhere else nearby.  Loved the drink selection and the food was tasty too.  Thanks for being an awesome bar!!!"}
{"text":"I keep wanting this place to be great. But it continues to suck. Right now , it's busy, so difficult to get a drink. But the table next to me is eating fish...I'm assuming cuz I don't see anything but it smells terrible !!! Maybe everything will align and we'll get good service, good food, and good drinks.  Good luck !!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting this establishment, the bartender (blonde) ignored me completely.   I then returned because friends love the decor there. The server was for some reason trying to force me to pay the tab. Rushing us to leave.   My third and final attempt at this horrible bar, the brunette waitress see's me sitting alone in the booth and brings over a menu! No words, no greeting, nothing.   The attitude of the women here is disgusting and ill never return to this bar."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance at Due & Proper, it's beautiful, artsy, dark, and plays awesome music, so I would return for that reason alone. Everything else, however, was a little glitchy. I visited with a few friends on a Tuesday night, so it was pretty empty, which was fine with us. Our server, however, seemed a bit ditzy- she couldn't answer any questions about the drink menu, then admitted that she just started a week ago.   I am a fancy cocktail kind of chick, so I ordered from their specialty menu. My first drink, which had strawberry vodka and rhubarb and some other stuff, was WAY too sweet- and this is coming from a lover of sweet cocktails. My second drink, however, had champagne and ginger and a pretty flower in it, and it was MUCH better- the first time. The second and third rounds of it were again, too sweet, and not prepared carefully. The first one was presented so beautifully, but the other two looked like they'd been just thrown together. Consistency, people!   My friends ordered the wings, and they were delicious. I loved the breading, they were big and meaty. So, that was a positive.  The bathrooms aren't all that nice, and could have been cleaner, which was a disappointment, especially considering they weren't busy or teeming with people.  So... Let's work out those glitches so I can return! Lots of potential, just not quite realized."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool.  The decor is easily the best part of this place although their drinks and attractive staff are a close second and third.  The decor is dark and mysterious but not gloomy.  The pictures on the wall are insane and very fun to look at.  The drinks are very well made and some can be very strong, which is a good thing.  They are not too expensive either, especially for what you are getting, which is a strong drink in a fun and creative environment.  They even have a shot wheel which is a ton of fun and adds to any night there!  My only qualm is that some of the staff are inattentive and just don't really seem to put much effort in which is a shame but oh well.  I still have a great time every time I come here.  Definitely a great place to come and lounge."}
{"text":"I come here often with my friends. Great location and vibe.  The interior designer knew what s/he was doing.  Creates an awesome 19th century British feel.  The weird paintings on the wall add casualness to the would by too-class-for-a-this-kind-of-bar interior.  Nice patio outside and lots of TVs.  Cornhole game outside, parking 30seconds away.  There's a big wheel-of-fortune thing where you can win a bottle of champagne and many other drinks that you won't easily forget.  Stay away from 'Creeping Death'....  Oh and did I mention?! They are open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I've frequented this establishment multiple times. The bartenders are very friendly and attentive. This is one of our favorite bars to visit. Also if you are into craft beer, they have great beer list including a lot of local breweries. If you're near Green Valley Ranch this is a great little place to check out."}
{"text":"There were less than a dozen people in the bar. Not busy at all. Our group ordered 2 identical drinks...and one. ONE! Appetizer!!!! And 1 hour later... I finally went to the non busy bar, asked about my app - waitress finally comes a few min later and ASKS WHAT WE ORDERED!!!!!!! Oh. MY god!!!! You had one job. You already looked miserable when you took our order and you couldn't put in ONE APPETIZER!!!!!! The end. Not coming here again. Too many bars in Henderson and Vegas. I'm good. I'll find better."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this cute new spot at the district.  Service was great and outdoor seating was perfect with a view of the musician and lights in the district courtyard.  The strawberry beer was delicious.  My favorite appetizer was the sausages in the puff pastry, so yummy!  We also had the pretzel bite, fries and wings which were okay but the puff pastry was by far my fav.  Nice spot for happy hour and to enjoy a nice vegas fall night out in a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I strolled into Due & Proper last Saturday around 8 pm. I instantly fell in love with the ambiance. It was dark and cozy with beautiful furniture and fixtures. Definitely a place that I could see myself spending hours with a group of friends.  D & P is supposedly owned by the same people who own Commonwealth downtown, which is probably my favorite bar in Vegas. I figured I'd stick to my usual and I ordered a Moscow Mule. It was awful! Worst than mules I've had at TGI Friday's. It kind of killed my vibe - I only had one drink.   Service was so so. The gal came around once to check on us, and they weren't very busy.   If you're in the district, check it out. I'd much prefer a PT's to this place."}
{"text":"Bartender playing with a toy drone as we walked in. It's all well and good until 20 minutes go by and nobody even said hello. Only about 6 people in the restaurant, now I understand why. Worst experience ever. Had to leave before even ordering.... Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Favorite happy hour spot in Henderson!!  I love the bourbon cocktail and my boyfriend drinks the rum. Both drinks are full of liquor and flavorful!  We usually stick to those drinks although they have tons of beer on tap and plenty of other options. All of the happy hour food is delicious. I am absolutely addicted to the edamame and the sliders are such a great value and delicious. We love them all but prefer the beef. We have also tried the delicious wings, dates, calamari, nachos..You will not be sorry if you stop in here for either the traditional or late night happy hour! I can't wait to come for dinner. I believe they share a kitchen with Whist and Stove next door but haven't made it in there yet because the Laid back Due & Proper always calls me when I'm in the District. Service has always been good at the bar."}
{"text":"Here on NYE.  Paid $200 plus tax & tip for a $4.99 bottle of disgusting \"not even real\" champagne. For $200 they could have springed for at least a $10 bottle of Korbel.  Disappointed"}
{"text":"The vibe in here was awesome and service was welcoming and on point. Popped in here before eating at the fish house across the path and was pleasantly surprised by the great Moscow mule and the fun conversation. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Service was poor and food and drink was poorer. I really wished it would be good but it just wasn't. No more money for you"}
{"text":"Didn't really care for this place. I went for happy hour with some co-workers and their happy hour food menu didn't have much of a selection. I picked from the regular menu and tried the peach, prosciutto flatbread and although the portion was decent it was cold and not much of anything special really. The place is somewhat small, although they do have outside seating. It was very loud and I had to yell just to talk to my group. Service was slow as well. I did like the eclectic look and unique vibe, but even that isn't worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Julian is the best bartender! Madame Victorian is my favorite drink and the quack and cheese is my favorite dish. I love the creepy carnival prints too! I just wish the late night menu had more offerings. Bring back the quack and cheese for the late night please!"}
{"text":"The food menu is very limited. The service is extremely slow. For place that had a month long pre opening, they are not providing good service at all. Waitress was forgetting parts of the order. Not a place to come back to anytime soon. Serious improvements are needed."}
{"text":"I love this spot! We had the grape fruit beer and fell in love. I could have spent the whole night in here catching up with friends!"}
{"text":"I visited Due and Proper a couple of times. After two visits I can say a few things about it. First, the servers are great. Friendly and prompt and efficient. I think they do a great job and they are accommodating and friendly as well. The outdoor seating is a nice touch on nice days and it's right in the middle of the district so the location is solid. I think the cocktails are creative and interesting. I tasted a couple of them that I thought were more than solid. My only real criticism is the food. I think it could be better. My first trip I tried the chimichurri steak dish and it was just \"ok\". Not a lot of food for $22 and honestly it was lacking in seasoning. Second trip we tried the trio of sliders. It's 9 sliders from their variety of choices. I thought all, again, were just ok. The fried chicken slider to me needs to be more tender. I think the burger slider has a similar problem where the meat is a bit dry, not juicy enough. The BBQ slider is fine but I would like to see a contrasting flavor to the sweetness and more texture there. Presentation was great and fries good but none of the food really elevates itself beyond the basic bar fare. I think they have all the pieces to be a top notch choice for the area but they should rethink the menu, add some creative specials and consider bolder flavors."}
{"text":"Woohoo! Finally Green Valley/Henderson has some fun bars that aren't focused around solely around video poker, doesn't smell like stale cigars, and is open 24/7! My friends and I come here about twice a week, the drinks are great, cool downtown/victorian atmosphere, big dark comfy booths (I may or may not have dozed off in one before), and everyone knows your name!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for a drink. The beer selection was slim but what they had was good, nice craft beers but the beers we ordered were bottles so I'm not sure what they had on tap. They brought the bottles and served the beer in a glass. We ordered the tater tots on the appetizer menu and they were really dry and honestly sad. The service was good but didn't make up for the terrible food and subpar beer selection. We didn't try any of their cocktails so can't really speak on that.   It's a great place to hang out in the District but wish they had more beers available. The atmosphere is nice, decor is pretty cool, and they have a patio area but it's not covered. Tater tots need some help."}
{"text":"Due & Proper is by far my favorite bar in Henderson and one of my faves in all of Vegas. The atmosphere is awesome and the vibe is super chill.   The service is also amazing. Kane, Julian, & Casey are always the bartenders that I'm hoping to see when I walk through the door. They all make quality drinks, are all extremely friendly and talkative, and are able to handle themselves well under pressure. Andrea is my favorite server there too. She's so sweet and has a great attitude.   The cocktails and food are really cool and offer something different than most bars in town.   I absolutely love it here and will continue to give them my business several times a week :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and a quick round of video poker. Even though she was bartending and waiting tables outside, Brittany provided excellent service. She is friendly and professional with a ready smile... definitely will return!"}
{"text":"We've been here in a booth for over an hour and the waitress has yet to come over so we ordered food and drink from the bar. Both great. The bartenders are kicking ass. Hence the two stars. The girl who seems to come to the other tables to remove empty drinks n brought one drink to the table behind us... she leans against a wall w her hands in her pockets most of the time. Blonde girl w short hair cut longer on one side. We are wondering how she makes money and who hasn't fired her yet. Waste of $."}
{"text":"Dead Rabbit and Old Speckled Hen to start off. Soft pretzels come with a cheese blend, warm freak PEANUT BUTTER,  AND mustard. Excellent choice...we went with the slider sampler which is also a great choice."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try somewhere new for happy hour and decided on Due and Proper. We sure are glad we came during happy hour because this place is a bit pricey.   We were extremely impressed with our drinks, I had the Wasatch Apricot beer and she had the Son of a Man cocktail. We loved both of our drinks and even had seconds.   For bites, we tried the chicken sliders and the Italian sub (happy hour choices, $5 each). The Italian sub was just okay but the chicken sliders were tasty, we especially loved the hot sauce that was paired with it.   The atmosphere was really unique here, the artwork was definitely different! They have a giant wheel with more than 80 different types of shots. If you pay $11 you can spin the wheel and the bartender will make it for you. Don't worry, if you don't like what you landed on, you can spin again!   We would come back but only during happy hour, which is from 3-7pm!"}
{"text":"This place had great vibes! Great drinks and good people whenever I was there. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really hate comparing places like this to locations in San Diego, but Vegas you've got a lot to learn about craft cocktail creations.   If you're somewhat familiar with the District or GVR for that matter, you probably know Due and Proper used to be the old Al's Garage. Now it's turned into what my brother likes to call the \"Haunted Mansion\" from Disneyland.  The decor is cool, the drinks are ok, and the bartending isn't the best. I came here on Saturday and the place wasn't very busy... yet. I finally got the bartender's attention after about what seemed like 10 minutes and ordered a measly Vodka & Soda.   After I got my order, I found and studied the craft cocktails menu and noticed an intriguing looking drink called, \"The Dead Rabbit\". This was a mix of carrot juice, pepper, and some other forgettable ingredients. This drink had a beautiful color and great presentation, but almost no flavor. It's like getting a fancy sports car only to find out that engine is powered by your feet. Not worth the effort. The rest of the night I stuck with Vodka and Soda.   This place eventually got packed, but we were lucky enough to grab a booth. From here on out, it was another fun filled bar night. The service at the booth was awesome, almost too good because I walked out of Due and Proper feeling, \"Stewed and Proper\".   I will be back, and upon my return I will try another craft cocktail. I mean there's always time for a second chance. Hence the reason why you can update reviews, right?"}
{"text":"this place USED to be great. Uniforms, actual glass glasses , servers, you know a real pub. Now you're lucky if you see a server, if a bartender knows how to make a drink on  their own cocktail menu or anyone has any concept of wtf is going on in general. 20 mins to fet a servers attention 20 more to get a drink EMBARRASSING."}
{"text":"we sat on the patio for 10 minutes and no came by and attempted to take our order or acknowledge us."}
{"text":"i'm seriously shocked by all the negative reviews of this place.  i stumbled across this gem and fell in love!  FINALLY green valley has a bar that rivals those downtown!!  the service i received was excellent, our waitress came by often to check on us and was very helpful suggesting her favorites from the menu.    i love the decor, it is completely changed from als garage, thank jesus.  anyone complaining about this change blows my mind as the last few times i went to als it was dead, even the bartenders gave the impression that they didn't want to be there.    this bar is absolutely amazing!  whist (next door) is fabulous too.  you have to check it out!"}
{"text":"A unique place for the district. Has an upscale feel on one side but still has tv screens showing sports behind the bar which takes away a little from the ambiance. Menu is small but food is good. Drink selection is decent. Music is too loud to have much of a conversation and the service isn't terribly fast. If you are interested in a leisurely night of a few drinks and a few snacks where you don't won't to talk much then this is the perfect place for you."}
{"text":"An extremely delicious burger. And great steak fries. Bartender was the only server on duty so we got as much attention as could be expected from clear across the room. Very convenient location in a plaza adjacent to our hotel Green Valley Ranch!"}
{"text":"I've been suffering from a cold all week.  The staff was most friendly and provided me with hot tea, lemon and honey. They really took care of me. Ordered wings and a burger which were tasty. Gotta come back for the brews. 5stars because of the staff"}
{"text":"This place was really chill & lay back. We came to have a few drinks for a friends birthday and we had a great time. We had a few things of their menu & I was not impressed at all. Nothing was satisfying for some reason. Their nachos were nothing special, nor their tatter tots & what I was most disappointed in was their Mac & cheese :( I would come back here to have a drink or two but never again to eat."}
{"text":"Love the vibes here! Definitely a great environment to just grab a few drinks with people and chill. I haven't had their food, but they definitely mix good cocktails. The bartenders offer great service! They are attentive, quick, and entertaining. The two guys who were bar tending when we were there had us laughing all night and took good care of us. We will definitely be going back. The only thing that was slightly off putting... And this is minor... Was that at the bar there are machines and the management has the bartenders put signs on the seats that say \"these seats are reserved for players only.\" I can understand they want to make more money, but there are no bar seats without player machines. From experience I've gotten better service at the bar than when at a table with a server, so I prefer sitting at the bar. So that caught me off guard. Otherwise, though, everything was awesome!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this bar when me and some friends happened upon it the other week. The ambiance is really unique inside. It's dark with red chandeliers and some creepy prints of paintings up on the wall. It was a Sunday afternoon and there was almost no one there.  I can't for the life of me remember what I ordered because I asked the bartender to make me something with gin and lavender bitters. I want to say there was some St. Germain in it? Either way I was extremely pleased with it. The bartenders were very nice to us and the service was prompt. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing experience with Tanner! Walked in to an empty bar on early Saturday afternoon and was greeted with such lively and amazing service! Has no idea what we wanted and told him to surprise us(which most bartenders will bark at), but he was more than stoked to serve us the most delicious crafted cocktails. He is so passionate about what he does and it shows in his attitude and drinks. I wish that I lived here so I could have him as my regular bartender!(My attempts at trying to convince him to make the trek to San Diego didn't work..dangit!) This guy hustled, even when he was the only one working(no bar-back, no servers, etc) to a full bar top and outdoor patio. Kudos Tanner! You rockkkkkk"}
{"text":"I just adore this venue. Such a unique and neat place with the design. Every custom cocktail I've had here has been amazing. I always ask the bartenders to surprise me and I've not yet been let down. Went in again lastnight was pretty darn busy but our waitress even though she was swamped was very nice and attentive. The bathrooms could use some attention to the cleaning but other than that I have no complaints about this place great for just sitting around having drinks. Maybe next time I'll try the food."}
{"text":"1 star for the decor and 1 star because it's the same company as commonwealth which I love. But 0 stars for anything else. We came in yesterday (may 14) around 6pm for a few drinks. Walking around The District we noticed it was pretty busy, to our surprise we walked into Due and Proper to an empty bar. Like literally zero people... and now we know why. The bartender really made us feel like we were just a bother to him by being there. They didn't have anything we were looking for and if their staff was at the least pleasant we would have stayed but we left. Honestly we probably will never return on our own accord which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"Service......SUCKS!! Drinks......SUCK!!!! The only people that frequent this establishment are friends of the employees. If you happen to politely interrupt the bar tender while he is talking to his buddies to ask for the bill because the waitress apparently walked into the Bermuda Triangle, he will walk away from you with a very smug demeanor as if you insulted his mother and return later with your bill.  STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"This would be a 4 star but the prices here are not so proper! It's funny, because this place is screaming to attract locals away from the strip to a cool, hip, progressive environment and atmosphere which it has.  However, unfortunately it has strip prices, which has me hesitant to go here nearly as often as I would if the prices were more reasonable.  $6 for a 12 ounce can a beer is a lot, and $8-12 bucks for a draft beer is overpriced, especially being in Henderson.  I think management has made poor decisions on pricing, which will result in less traffic and business than the bar may potentially have.  Hopefully they will wake up, because I'd rather just have drinks on the strip.  Still a cool spot to check out."}
{"text":"I really love this bar - the decor and ambience are really cool. The bartenders are really nice and attentive. Drink menu options are interesting but if you can't decide on something or don't like anything on their menu, they pretty much have a full bar. One night I came here and there was a DJ playing some really good old school hip hop. I'm trying to figure out when this happens as I'd love to come back on that particular night. I really like that the crowd here is not pretentious or has that \"strip\" vibe. This goes the same for Whist next door."}
{"text":"Love the food at Due and Proper but the service is really bad. Came in to get a bite to eat and sat at one of the booths I waited for 10 minutes then I went to the bar and placed my order. The bartender was very polite and made a great drink. I really want to like this place but they really need to work on getting more servers. The Fish Sticks are wonderful and the drinks are good. But if you don't sit at the bar be prepared to wait for awhile."}
{"text":"The perfect little hangout place in The District with just the right drinks and happy hour specials. Love that they have the option for outdoor seating. This place gives me the the feel of Commonwealth because of the decor-love it! The music can get a bit obnaxiously loud, but other than that, what's there not to like about this place?! :)"}
{"text":"With Wendy behind the Bar, this place cannot Lose. Even with a Hip-Hop DJ, which turned numerous patrons away, as I sat at the bar for hours, Wendy welcomed multiple parties that were about to turn around and go elsewhere, to stay. I will definitely come back, as long as she is Bartending!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and the staff is amazing and personable! Super cool place to sit at the bar and hang out! If it's nice out its great to sit at the tables! The two male bartenders really took care of us made our time super amazing! A place that we have been many a times and will most defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  Great service and the deviled eggs are delicious.  I will change the rating to five next time I come in.  I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice job on the remodel and a great place close to my house to grab some drinks. Cool atmosphere with some really nice artwork on the walls. Different type of funky music with a lot of British punk bands being played, nice choice of eclectic music. We are safe from nickel back and Kanye west.  On to the hedonistic side of me, this place has brought in some decent looking women finally to the district. Thursday nights have some younger females out to party, it's refreshing.  Food is above average bar fare and they have a really good selection of craft beers. Scrimshaw, squatters, and some other not often seen brews.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"So I got home from a long day in the service industry at my job at a  popular strip resort. My wife and I live in Anthem so we wanted to go somewhere not too far, and wanted some cocktails and something casual to eat. My wife called to ask about happy hour and was told it started at 11pm. It was about 10:45 so it looked like this was just meant to be. Stripped off my work uniform and threw on my leather jacket over my hoody, hopped in the wifey's Subie and headed down to Due & Proper in The District: Walked in and sat at a table, after a semi-long wait, our server arrived at our table and we were  told happy hour starts at 12am. So that sucks, BUT our server was kind enough to give us some happy hour menus and accommodate us with the 11pm time that was communicated. There was only two servers/bartenders in the whole place, so we decided to just relocate to the bar (which I prefer anyway). Long story short:  Ordered two cocktails = They were OK and pretty cheap, but round two was a beer for the lady and Jack Daniel's double for myself  Ordered the pretzels = Good. Hot out of the oven, came with a cheese dipping sauce and peanut butter, but the kitchen forgot the spicy brown mustard  Ordered the Irish Nachos = They were good. I think they were as good as Irish Nachos get  Overall, great option for late night drinks and food. Cool, vibey spot, especially if you are in the neighborhood. Almost four stars, but staffing seemed low and forgetting the mustard is unforgivable."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday, loved the atmosphere and the welcoming staff. Specially thanks to Maria our bar tender who spoke to me in Spanish which made me feel right at home,  she was super nice and nonetheless beautiful."}
{"text":"Love this little gem. I like to play here, because it is one of the few non-smoking places in Vegas that has gaming. They also have auto-play on the machines and a good variety of games and denoms. The food was pretty outstanding. The employees are nice too. The establishment is well kept. It can get busy at night, but it is a good type of crowd. It's got a great vibe."}
{"text":"The Due & Proper has the best bistro/bar offering in Henderson in my opinion. The menu is a perfect blend of new & updated old-school items. Fresh ingredients prepared in a modern pretty healthy way. Apps or entree, you really can't go wrong. Plenty of local craft brews on tap as well as an ample wine list and full bar. Reasonable prices. Service is spot on too: fast, friendly, knowledgable.  There's an open floor plan with a big tastefully lit and decorated bar area taking the lion's share. Nice blend of locals and guests. Makes for a super inviting atmosphere.  Off-Strip eating/drinking/socializing at its best."}
{"text":"Great place and a great menu, with some core problems that need to be addressed to make it top notch. The happy hour menu and prices are one of the best deals in Henderson. The atmosphere is wonderful and unique. The problem is that management is weak on ensuring fast service. I had to get up out of my booth to get someone to me my next order. The wifi was weak and would go on and off. The service wasn't crisp and the place was relatively empty both times went there. With some care and attention, this could be a real winner of a place."}
{"text":"A friend and I wanted to check out new bars on our side of town so we ended up here. We went on a Thursday night and it was pretty slow. The place has a dark vampy feel to it with cool music. There's an area with couches and tables to sit at along with the main bar. The cocktails we ordered were really tasty and different. The service was dead and not welcoming, but wasn't too awful to ruin the mood. If you're looking for a chill place to grab some drinks with friends this would be a good spot."}
{"text":"The pretzels were amazing!!  Some of the seats are first-come-first-serve and I was lucky that I was with party that got there early.  Sit-down service was mediocre, but when I ordered from the bar the bartenders were friendly.  The ambiance reminds me of a higher-end version of the Artisan.    I had fun and am looking forward to the next time I go!"}
{"text":"Terrible service unless you're one of the obvious lush locals... have to yell if you want to get attention of bartender for another round of overpriced drinks"}
{"text":"This place seems to change staff more than anywhere else in Vegas. As a local, it's frustrating coming here for a $10 micalada, with warm corona beer. That's even high for on the strip prices.   Art work is fascinating to look at but staff is terrible. Never know if you are going to get good or bad service.  There's better bars in GVR"}
{"text":"Very poor service. They gave us raw chicken, when we told them, they asked what did we want them to do about it. Really?  The waitress had a cold sterile demeanor, she didn't even clear our plates, we had to take them to the bar ourselves. It was incredibly difficult to get her attention, however when it was time for the check, she showed up in less than 5 seconds and conveniently  hung around the table behind us, doing absolutely nothing while we got our payment together. Funny, since we couldn't get her attention all night.   This place is a joke. So sad. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was the only person in here for brunch.  Granted it's a rainy & cold Saturday morning!  I had a spicy spicy bloody and Fish & Chips while I killed time waiting for shops to open! I bet this is a fun place at night.  Ill be back when I'm in Hendo!"}
{"text":"A friend was super excited to try out this place a week ago Friday.  We made it in there early so we could sample the happy hour specials.  We are all yelpers, so the two of us who read the yelp reviews were slightly concerned about this place, but we figured that since we were at the District, we could always find another place to go.... and that is what we had to do.  We ordered chicken sliders and calamari to share.  Two of us ordered a bartender recommended martini.  It tasted like grape juice.  We both drank it, but didn't really want to.  Third friend ordered drink from the happy hour menu.  It had such a bitter after taste, she asked for another drink.  The chicken sliders were good.  The calamari.....it was OK.  The sauce was really odd.   Instead of a marinara, it was more cocktail/fishy tasting.  All three of us tried it three or four times trying to guess what it was.  Finally, we gave up.  We were having a girls night out and when our fourth showed up, we were ready to bail.  Instead, we went to Elephant Bar and dropped $150.  We wanted to like this new place, but it didn't live up to the good reviews."}
{"text":"We ordered at the bar, so I can't comment on the sit down service.  Beer list is decent.  Prices are ok.  I really wanted to love this place (still do!), but the ambiance just doesn't seem right to me. It used to be the garage with huge garage doors open to the patio. Now it's all closed off and dark and the patio is just for smokers (pardon my bias!). We are desperate for cool cocktail bars in this area, but this one falls into the same category as elixir for me: smoky video poker bar. I get that machines are how you make money in this town, but I just wish they didn't feel so obtrusive.  I'll give it another chance, but my hopes aren't high. Looking forward to the tippling Bros opening in GVR!"}
{"text":"I read it was a Arizona Cardinals bar. First time here was great and the crew was awesome. Food is good. Unfortunately the waitress today 9/25 disappeared for over 30 min. Had to go find her. She was outside sitting at a table. The bartender is cheering for the opposing team. How is this a Cardinals bar? Don't feel like it's fun here. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This place has the recipe for success, it just needs to be tweaked ever so slightly.   Came to Due & Proper for a work Happy Hour and it was kind of slow for a Friday evening Happy Hour which is usually not a good sign. My group and i ordered a number of things like Korean Street Tacos, Sliders, a Flatbread & some Fries. The food didn't reel me in so much as it was \"Just OK\". The service again was \"Just OK\" as the employees didn't look as if they genuinely enjoy what they are doing or where they are at, with little to no smiles on their faces. What i did enjoy was the Old Fashioned that i ordered which was surprisingly well made. As well as the music playlist they have playing in the background, not too loud to take away from your conversation as well. This location with the patio view and the general area not having much in this type of establishment could find more patrons if they made some simple adjustments. I could be wrong but its my understanding that this spot is related to the Carson Kitchen restaurant that never disappoints. Food, service, energy of the location is all something you can bring to this place and it could take off.   Ill return but not often, as its one of those \"Oh im in the area\" kind of places for me personally."}
{"text":"This bar is a cute bar with a fun and funky feel. Cocktails are good, albeit a little pricey, but it's a nice place to meet up with friends and share some time.  The appetizers are good, their buffalo wings are really good.  Located in the District in the Green Valley Ranch area of Henderson, Due and Proper is a nice place to visit with locals or with friends visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"This is a very swanky bar. What was Al's Garage is now has a depression age feel with overstuffed furniture and a great patio. The unique wall decor has a funky goth feel (think....lord of the rings meets the Industrial Age). The happy hour menu is great. It'd be a 5 star until you experience the bathrooms. Women, don't we want a clean, easy to use restroom; right?  I walk into one of the two poorly lit stalls, and see wads of toilet paper everywhere.  \"Interesting\". Then, I see why. I go to use the said toilet paper (in its usual space), and it flys to the ground. There's no holder!  It just looks like a holder!  I grab the next one and hold on, it's the last one!  Needless to say I make it. But as I flush, I chuckle at the other 3 rolls of toilet paper on the floor. So, the 5 star moves to 3. All because the overlooked, very important, women's bathroom."}
{"text":"Tanner and Aaron are the greatest things to ever happen to the drinking craft cocktail scene. My drinks are ALWAYS on point and they are the reason I keep coming back here over and over and over and over. I piss so much money away on the machines there but seriously I don't even realize it because their drinks are SO GOOD and by THEIR drinks, I intend to mean, the drinks SPECIFICALLY prepared by Tanner and Aaron. My experience has always been stellar.........Untilllllll I met the manager. Ughhhhhh she sucks so much. Thank god she's not the manager at Balboa. She made me feel so uncomfortable and unwelcome. Maybe she doesn't realize I'm a regular and I put about 2k in the machines a week (at least) on a regular basis (hence the term regular) needless to say she is detached and unaware and unappreciative of her regulars and customers who spend their lives at bars like this. I hate to say this, but after meeting Jada or Giada or jade-uh however you spell her name, I am seriously never coming back to Due and Proper or Whist so long as she is there tyrannically dictating and delegating ridiculous demands improperly that are not customer oriented and are seriously banal. She does not understand customer service and she makes her customers feel SERIOUSLY SUPER UNWELCOME!!! Don't go to these places if jade-uh is working. Or go if Tanner or Aaron are working even if that manager is there because they will make your drink right and make you feel so welcome and satisfied that you will keep coming back for more even though you will be subjected to bouts of incompetence if you ever have to deal with jade-uh. She will make you feel like you are doing something wrong and it's the worst feeling ever!!!!!!! But she doesn't matter because once you meet Tanner and Aaron you will forget about all that and get lost in the beautiful feeling of warmth and being welcome as they create for you the best cocktail you've ever had!! No joke. Real talk, I love tanner and I love aaron and I LOVE due and proper so please go there and ask for your most favorite drink and they will master it for you. I just hope you don't encounter the bit$&y manager jade-uh. She will taint and tarnish your quasi flawless e peri rice at this craft cocktail Mecca. Just a word to the wyse. Heed my warning. I share this with you from my heart"}
{"text":"Went in for drinks and appetizers and had a great experience. All the tables were full, so we ordered drinks at the bar, the bartender came right over (and they were really busy) and was very friendly. Drinks were a reasonable price, a Johnny Walker Black and a Maker's Mark old fashioned were $20. We sat on the patio for a bit, and the patio heaters made it very comfortable. When a table opened up we went inside and a server came over pretty quickly, and again was very friendly. We ordered the pretzel sticks and the chocolate donut dessert. SO GOOD! It's nice to have a cool, nice bar to go to in Henderson, we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Busy day at the hospital and I needed a drink.  One of the nurses had recommended a new barstaurant that had just opened in the district by GVR. Typically this area is aimed for the older demographic but when me and a friend had arrived it was sporting a new crowd.  The bar is the same area as Al's Garage in that alley by Lucille's.  The restaurant has not had it's grand opening yet but is currently having their soft opening.  Upon arriving to the restaurant you're not greeted by a host/hostess but you simply seat yourself.  Soon after the manager (Brian) who also operates Common wealth and Park on Fremont had greeted us and was very accommodating.    Soon after our waitress (Sierra) had a arrived and took our drink orders.  Setting: Very modern, english interior.  You feel like you're inside of an exclusive bar because of the dark decor and fancy decorations.    Drinks:  Madame Victorian arguably one of the best drinks i have ever had (and i've had a few drinks in my lifetime). Nice fruitiness with such an excellent subtle tone of alcohol.  My friend had got the \"When the Smoke settles\" which was amazingly chocolately and very smooth.  I had two other drinks which were okay.  Food:  I got the burger which was amazing.  The meat was oozing with juices and very tender.  My friend got the fried chicken sliders which were just as tasty.  Service:  Friendly management, Our server and busser were always around just in case we needed anything.  Overall: Finally a cool place for the younger crowd to hang out at in Henderson which is pretty hard to find.  No more having to drive all the way down to fremont to enjoy a nice drink with friends.  I would definitely come check this place out."}
{"text":"awesome place to grab a few drinks with friends, great atmosphere with a touch of hollywood regency style. Great selection of craft beers on tap and friendly service."}
{"text":"Located in The District at Green Valley Ranch, this English-esque pub has a great happy, and reverse happy hour!Here is the big plus, I walked in they were playing The Jam, followed by The Ramones, then The Clash, Joe Jackson, Elvis Costello and I think you get the picture, great music. I had very good service. I say if you are shopping at The District stop in for a pint. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"What a chill and relaxed place. Lots of partying people, then industry staff, then sexy people! Food is served practically all through the night. The paintings and furniture are quite, original. Very, special canned beers. Draft, too.  A plethora of alcohols to choose. Kerpow drinks. I like that.  Plenty of parking, whether in the main parking lot by Lucilles or the side fronting Brighton.  Fun upbeat time!!"}
{"text":"This bar has a great location. They are in The District down the same walkway as Lucille's and King's Fish House. Parking at the shopping center is easy and it is a quick walk to the bar.  My favorite part of this bar is the outdoor patio seating. I decided to try this place out because the weather was beautiful and I was looking for a spot to get food and drink outside. We arrived around 5:30 on a Saturday because I wanted to make sure that we were able to snag a table.   We started with a couple of cocktails. I had the Rosie Lee and my husband had the Black Tot. We both thought our drinks were okay, but not mind blowing. Usually I'm intrigued by several options when looking at cocktail menus, but nothing on the list really seemed that exciting.  We shared the Chile Cheese Fries, Deviled Eggs, and Beef Sliders. The chile cheese fries had fresh cheddar, Hatch green chiles, and sausage. I love that they have a dish with Hatch chiles. They were pretty good, but the thick fries kind of overwhelmed the flavors. The deviled eggs and sliders were good as well. Like the drinks, the food was good, but nothing I would crave or seek out.  The Key Lime Pie was the best food item. It was very tart like Key Lime Pie should be. I'm glad they didn't turn a tart dessert into something bland like most restaurants do.  We'll be back because the outdoor seating and atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Came to check out the place for a friend's birthday and happy to say that I'm a fan!  It wasn't busy on a Saturday night, which was nice because we were able to snag enough seats for a party of 10.  The decor looks great if you're looking for a place to impress!    Our server Drea was very attentive.  She checked up on us frequently and even insisted our party to spin the wheel.  For $11, why not?  We won a swedish fish drink that tasted pretty good and there was another drink that looked like horchata, but burned in the back of my throat.  It's a gamble if you're looking to spin the wheel for something you actually like, but I enjoyed watching my friends try their luck.    We also tried some of their specialty cocktails.  Rosie Lee is where it's at!  I'm not a big drinker, and when I do drink, I prefer not to taste the alcohol.  Rosie Lee tastes like grapefruit and I could sip that all night long!  We also tried Madame Victorian and a Moscow Mule, but they were just meh..  If you're going the straight for the liquor, they give you your money's worth when ordering shots.    The also serve food and it's pretty awesome!  We loved the Irish Nachos, which come with crispy waffle fries, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, and jalapenos.  It was so good that we ordered another one after finishing it.    Definitely a change of pace from DTLV's bar scene. I liked how it isn't crowded, they offer specialty cocktails and elevated bar food, and you can stay however long you want and have a good time."}
{"text":"I sat down with my boyfriend at one of the booths for approximately 20 minutes before he headed over to the bar to get someone to serve us. When she finally came over to bring the cocktail list as he asked, she didn't even bother to greet us or ask if it was our first time there.   I ordered some blueberry drink and my boyfriend picked out a chocolate drink. Both were disgusting. The waitress never came around to ask us what we thought of our drinks. I had to flag her down so she could bring me my check and even then, she just didn't care to ask why we were cashing out immediately after getting our first drink.   Both my boyfriend and I were excited about what seemed like a promising bar with some cool decor and art in Henderson. Now we don't ever expect to come back here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved to Henderson from Sacramento CA, and we were starting fresh to find our new local bar.  We are so grateful to have found this one.  Let me start off with the bartenders:  Aaron and Josh are absolutely AMAZING.  They are the sweetest guys ever.  Instantly started conversation with us and they both make amazing drinks.   The cocktails are on point.  I highly recommend ordering the butcher when you come here.   The food is also amazing!  We love to get the calamari and bacon wrapped dates.   Our favorite part though?  The decor.  It is amazing. Weird and eclectic.  It fits all our needs.   Overall due and proper is a great spot to come grab a drink during the day or night. We also love playing the machines at the bar!"}
{"text":"Had the best New Years yet here! They threw a great party ($50 all you can drink if you wanted to, but you didn't have to.) Was a great environment. Haven't experienced it here on a \"regular\" night yet but looking forward to it. I also heard the happy hour is great."}
{"text":"Due and Proper is fun and much needed in the District.  I like what the owners are doing with the old Al's Garage.  We had the pretzel sticks and a whole bunch of drinks after.  My group mainly stayed with whiskey.  Their craft cocktails are creative and highly recommended.  The Dead Rabbit drink was pretty awesome !  First time I had whiskey and carrot juice mixed together.  Fun! and that's what it's all about."}
{"text":"This review is for happy hour during the week. They had a good selection of drinks and lots of delicious apps. We had the cheese balls, tacos, beef sliders, and deviled egg. The whiskey based drink I had packed a punch and was a great deal for five dollars! My favorite food was the cheese balls they were ahhh mazing.   The interior is dark and modern with an upscale romantic English feel. My only complaint is it was freezing inside, which might be good on a date ;-) !"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent happy hour this is the place. It's 3-7pm, so we decided to try it out before heading over to GVR for 6dollar movie night.   I was pretty skeptical at first: it's dimly light, their was only one bartender and probably 12 patrons, and she took a while to acknowledge us. But I'm happy I stayed! The food was really good! And we were able to watch some bowl games.   We had the calamari for 4bucks, I personally thought it even edged out Fleming's (my husband disagreed) but it wasn't overlooked or chewy as calamari tends to be. We also tried the beef sliders. It advertised them as being made with house pickles...didn't taste like it but overall very good. (5 bucks)  We had a IPA beer, on happy hour for 4 bucks. Personally don't care for well drinks or mixed drinks...but their list was impressive.   Overall, I will return."}
{"text":"Very unique venue with a intimate setting. I loved spinning the alcohol wheel and the service was on point! I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a new chill spot."}
{"text":"Another Great District spot!! So nice to go somewhere for cocktails where u r able to enjoy eachother's company, & hear eachother speak((non nightclub:), yayaa)) Our party of 5 had 2 very comfy sofas & chairs that we took over& made our own. This place was very busy but it seemed the perfect amount of people were there as everyone was nestled  nicely in groups , no one had to stand due to lack of seating. The waitresses were attentive, fast & cute:) It is a super cozy place, not too big, not to small, with just the right account of everything that makes a bar great to go back to with friends. Chandeliers galore, comfy leather furniture & a great wall mural. This is a must if u live in Henderson area & want to entertain."}
{"text":"I will not come back here ever again.  The only reason I gave them 1 star was because the nice decorations and cocktails were tasty.  But besides that, I went here for my birthday and I warned the bartenders that I had many friends coming in for the night to celebrate my birthday with me.  The bartenders said \"bring it on\".  They were nice and friendly before my friends arrived.  But as soon as everyone showed up, they did not give us any attention.  Drinks took forever and they also messed up everyone's bar tab.  Terrible service.  They couldn't even fix my friend's bill so they just gave him 2 more shots on the house.  Still did not fix the problem.  Terrible way to spend my birthday."}
{"text":"I met some friends here (not by choice) for some beers. I have been here three times and it is the last. Nothing is great about this place. The food is  average to poor. The service is always slow. They are out of items such as Blue Moon. Horrible server who didn't even check on the group for more drinks. We had to flag her down. And the place wasn't even busy. The prices are high here for being off the Strip. Save your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Nice little place in the district. Great happy hour specials and a fun game of chance wheel. We had the sliders, calamari and deviled eggs during happy hour. Everything tasted great. The guy bartender jeff was very informative about the beers and what we should try. Plus he gave us incredible service. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Drop by to this bar to get and a couple of drinks. The place was practically empty but I want you to greet me so I just grab a seat myself. Finally when the bartender noticed she came by with a menu and offered some recommendations. I ordered their Hangover Burger and it was good. All in all, food was okay,price was decent, decor is modern, but the lack of service was a turn off. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I called prior to see if they had happy hour on Saturday and the bartender told me yes. He then went on to explain all the specials and the time it would start. My bf and I arrived 3pm sharp, sat down in dining area and was not acknowledged at all (there were 2 couples at the bar when we arrived). After realizing we weren't gonna get served we walked over to the bar and ordered.  The bartender then apologized for giving us the wrong info on the phone and said it was not happy hour... I then proceeded to ask if he could honor one drink as a courtesy for happy hour.. and he said no. Aside from that the food and decor was excellent."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the decor. Kinda off beat but super interesting. The reason for three stars is that there service is not great. Having visited many times you'll be staring at your empty glasses for most of the night. The food is way over priced, it's tasty but seriously over priced and the portion sizes are quite small. The other three star reason is their music choice and volume is way off from the decor and atmosphere. There is a sense when you enter that you will have sophisticated time in a old skool, speakeasy kinda place. Then you find that the music is rock and extremely loud. Like yelling at each other to talk loud. They really should stick with their lounge vibe in the music choice and level. Could be great but it's just ok."}
{"text":"Food was decent and cocktails were ok. Service was absolutely terrible. And they charge $3 if you order liquor on the rocks? $3 for an ice cube?! I've never have come across this ever. So we spent $9 on just ice cubes for 3 drinks."}
{"text":"We had a really nice time here.  The ambiance is fantastic!  Very, very cool art and vibe all around.  The music was a touch too loud for our liking- it made having conversation a little difficult but hey, it's bar on a Friday night.  I had The Butcher to drink, and honestly I'll come back just for that- I loved it!  We also got their deviled eggs, fish and chips, and a patty melt.  It took a long time for the food to come out but worth the wait.  Happy hour is the way to go- it can get $$$ in a hurry otherwise.  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here during happy hour. Ordered the deviled eggs, nachos and cheese balls. Deviled eggs were pretty plain...would t order again. Nachos and cheese balls were really good! Also ordered their version of a Mai Tai...that was delicious :). Bar was full of people with only one bartender so she couldn't attend to us much, but despite this, she was really sweet and it didn't bother us. If you want a chill place to have appetizers and drinks with good music and funky paintings to look at, this is the place. I'll definitely be going back !"}
{"text":"Great hang out spot with probably one of the most tastiest bar food I've ever had. I came to visit recently on a weekday for brunch (it was my first time AND there was BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS). To my surprise there had only been my group plus one other gentleman so everything from food prep and service was extra prompt which we enjoyed. Knocking down one star for the bathrooms."}
{"text":"We were excited to come here and watch the Denver game. They have a nice shaded patio with tv's outside. The bronco game was on the tv on the patio but the sound was from the Cowboy game being shown inside. We asked if they could change the sound and the first thing the waitress said was no we can't but you can go to our sister bar and they have the Denver game on. I asked why they couldn't change it and she said that's the way it's wired. Who builds a bar that is not optimally wired for the best sports experience possible, especially when their isn't much of a draw for the bar otherwise. Sorry but I could not ever come here again because I don't have the faith that whatever game I want to see is first off even on and secondly would I be able to hear it. Piss poor management.  It's disappointing to see a place that could be doing much better but it's obvious that neither the staff or owners could care less"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the location, ambiance, décor but most of all the food is awesome! My husband LOVEs the deviled eggs he could eat two orders by himself. The happy hour here is great! You can literally try everything off their happy hour menu and not break the bank. Or order two apps share them and leave satisfied and full! Havent tried the full menu yet but I know we will be regulars here. The staff is great, really helpful and friendly. This is my favorite spot off the strip so far. This place is great for date night. Hang out in the district grab a bite to eat have some cocktails and see a movie!"}
{"text":"I've had excellent experiences here and enjoy the quality drinks the bartenders provide especially the Wheel shots."}
{"text":"The food alone is worth the 5 stars!! Best Breakfast in Vegas!   Great service and Awesome Bloody Mary's!!! The Weekend Flatbread is my favorite and my husband loves the Frittata. Worth A Try if you are considering this place"}
{"text":"Great drinks, laid back vibe, tasty food & some really well trained mixologists! Bravo Tanner for crafting some fantastic cocktails!"}
{"text":"Went to happy hour with some friends last week. Drinks were pretty good and their Chicken sliders are some of the best sliders I've had. Not to mention they are only $5 (for 4 sliders with fries) during happy hour. It's a bit hot on their patio but if they added some fans or misters this would be a great summer night place."}
{"text":"This is based solely on the bartender service. Not on food.  I asked for an IPA on draught and got a sample of IPA called \"giggle.\" I ended up having 2 and felt great! The bartender Tanner was very helpful and even gave me tips when I asked what other locals did around the area. Cool ambiance. One setback was that he let some guy name Juan (I think he's a regular) and his friends control the music so it was Hispanic and reggaeton music for the hour and half I was there. Besides the music the service was great."}
{"text":"Okay, here's the deal ... This would be EXACTLY the type of bar I would want to create and own.  The vibe is cool and the decor is super eclectic and dark.  On the other hand, the service is horrendous!  It's open seating and for some reason the servers have a difficult time noticing new people coming into the seating area even though the place is dead.  The last few times I've been there it has been the same old shenanigans ... sit down ... and wait.  It's like one of those places where you need to make sure you have your entire order ready along with your card and ask for the check all at once just because you're not sure if you'll ever see your server again.  That's not fun.  Anyway, I went there last night and left after waiting around for ten minutes because no one served me ... or even welcomed me in.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We popped in here one night on a whim. We did not have food, but the drinks were tasty and we liked the general ambiance. Service was terrific, and we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Due & Proper is a nice pub to have a drink or munch on some grub!!  The atmosphere is very European with paintings on the wall and decked out with chandeliers. I mostly stop by during happy hour, they have good specials on the food and the cocktails.   My problem is outside of happy hour, the drinks and food are a bit pricey more than I think is reasonable based on the quality. The quality is not always consistent, especially with the drinks. On some days it tastes watered down, other days I feel the strength of it right off the bat.   My preferred drink of choice: The Old Dublin, a mixture of two types of whiskey and citrus juices. I would recommend trying the Italian Proper sandwich that was pretty tasty.     I've never had a problem with the service, I feel the staff are nice people and do a good job."}
{"text":"A local hangout spot in the district, Due and Proper offers beer, craft cocktails and a select appetizer food.   I really enjoy this place and have had a lot of great times with friends. Sometimes on the weekend (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) the music can be too loud to have conversations in sitting areas.   The other issue we've run into at Due and Proper is that there drinks can sometimes be inconsistent. One night, you'll have one of their signature cocktails and it's great! The next night you can order the same drink and it tastes completely different? - this has happened multiple times...  There food is great and it's open 24/7! I hate giving it 3 stars, they just need training and better management perhaps?"}
{"text":"Stopped in after shopping in The District.  We wanted to get a bite to eat and gamble once we saw the machines.  There was only one other customer in the bar which should have given us a clue.  We received our first drink and ordered 2 apps from the Happy Hour menu.  At that point the bartender disappeared for nearly 15 minutes...:(.  We got our food, but with no napkins, silverware or side plates.  Had to ask for these twice!  Also, after I visited the filthy restroom I informed the bartender there were no hand towels.  Another friend went in maybe a half hour later--still no towels!  Did I mention we were gaming?  I was playing .50, 2.50 a hand video poker and my one of my friends had put $60 in her machine.  We only had two drinks each.  When we received our check, there was a big circle around the 1 drink they comped for each of us who gambled.   Wow...is there a $50 minimum in to get a drink comped??  Won't waste my time visiting here again..."}
{"text":"Love the vibe at this bar and absolutely love the District.  At Due and Proper, the service at the bar was horrific.  My genuine advice to anyone going to this bar, is to skip the \"spin the wheel\" and order specialty drinks.  The male bartender last night with the brown hair who kind of looks like Andy Samberg, is not too keen on it and blatantly ignored our request for like 15 minutes.  Then, the bartender with the clean shaven head ended up helping us out.  The shots tasted like the end of a watered down well drink after the ice has melted, ugh awful.  We ended up pouring them in an empty cup and letting the busser take them.  Mind you, the shots are $11.00 so it's not like you are getting some kind of deal, oh besides, of course, spinning the wheel which the bartenders clearly hate.  My rating is as follows: the two stars are for the ambiance (we had a good time getting together), the three missing ones are for the lack of service and the gross shots, which is the entire purpose of \"Bartenting\" in my opinion.  I can pour my own shitty shots at home and wait until the ice melts to drink them and be disappointed in myself instead of someone who does this for a living :)."}
{"text":"Cool little bar with artistic vibe.  The service wasn't that great but the drinks were delicious and it was a chill place to hang out with friends on the patio. I would go back, I just hope I get a better waitress next time."}
{"text":"Located at The District, Due and Proper is wedged in the same alleyway as Lucille's Barbecue. It's marked by a red old-school overhang and red door. I found myself at Due and Proper for a department holiday party on a Friday evening. Upon arriving at 8PM, the bar was teeming with patrons with nary a seat in sight. My group was able to snag a table as another party was leaving. Due and Proper was definitely a snatch and grab type of place.   The menu was limited as far as vegetarian options go and prices were on the expensive side. We decided to stick with drinks. A tall can of PBR was $5, and a bottle of Heineken set us back $6. A nice-sized pint of Coors Light draft was $5. Drinks were average priced, I'd say.  I loved the vibe of the bar. The decor was quirky and interesting, and the music wasn't half bad either. Despite how crowded it was, the waitress did a pretty good job taking care of us. My only grievance is that making conservation was extremely difficult inside. My oh my it was loud in there!  The seating of Due and Proper is best suited for groups. This bar is obviously a popular spot with locals. I'd try visiting during happy hour to get more bang for your buck. :)  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #261"}
{"text":"I truly love this place as a local! Black tot is a must try! The environment and culture is very artistic and trendy."}
{"text":"First timer and I will be back for sure! No smoke! Great drinks and a fun atmosphere. I ate one of their hamburgers which was not bad. Later I had some chicken fingers which were just okay. Had a great time and not having to smell cigarettes is a huge bonus."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Service was extremely slow but they did say they were short. Food was okay but a little bit pricey. I later learned that the area was ritzy so I guess that's to be expected. Very loud but TVs all around and fun to go with a group. Not too bad at all and other places around to enjoy afterward."}
{"text":"The food has always been very meh and the prices always seemed a little high, but the reason I kept going back was the serving staff. Due has recently experienced a tremendous amount of turn over and I wish I could say it was for the better.  For the last six months I have frequented Due and Proper, mostly on Friday nights. The cocktails were well made, and the selection was solid. I never sat at the bar so I always dealt with the wait staff (mostly Drea and Mary) and they had always been great. They were always friendly and funny, but this all changed about a month ago.   After this weekend, I have spent my last dollar there. I honestly don't understand how other people have anything positive to say about the food. It is overpriced, under quality and there are so many amazing places to eat near here. The drinks are still solid, but the staff is now no better then a TGIF. If you are fine with humdrum service you might as well not spend $11 on a drink and go somewhere else. This is truly a shame, as it WAS a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"We especially like Due and Proper because yep you guessed it.....the out door patio. Not sure if it is dog friendly or not we've seen dogs here but there is a sign that says no dogs past this point. It would definitely be 5 stars if dog friendly for sure. NFL draft specials, pretty stock bar food munchies. In the heart of the district so the atmosphere is good. I've been here several times when it's busy and the staff seems to get overwhelmed easily. Maybe understaffed at times. I like the atmosphere so I can look past that."}
{"text":"Updating our earlier review to five stars, they now have the lounge area covered, great attitude by the folks that work there and the fun edgy vibe can't be beat!  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Really good restaurant. Stopped by for lunch and to my surprise it was a Las Vegas/Henderson pub that did not stink of cigarettes!  Pleasant surprise in this day and age. Service was very friendly. But note the name, the food and drinks here take a little bit of time, but they are worth it. I had the hang over burger and it was one of if not the best burger I've had in years!  They take great care in their food and drink preparation."}
{"text":"Came here for my best friend's birthday on a Sunday night and we had the best time! The bartender made our experience a great one and even allowed her to spin the wheel for free since she was the birthday girl! He was even nice enough to let us change the music playlist to a more top hits/hip hop vibe to get our party started haha There wasn't a lot of people and the bar is pretty spacious with lots of seating so great for large groups. They are also open 24 hours a day so get your party on anytime of the day or night!   They have a great cocktail menu with specialty drinks ranging from $10-12 and an array of beers. A bunch of us girls got the \"Rosie Lee\" which was a strawberry cocktail that was super yummy! Definitely recommend that if you're looking for something sweet. Their Moscow mules are really great too and have the perfect balance of vodka and ginger beer that leaves you wanting anotha one!   The ambiance is really cool; it's a vintage style English pub and has interesting paintings all over the bar. There is a huge wheel behind the bar that costs $11 for you to spin and it chooses your drink of choice which is a really cool and fun idea!  Definitely recommend to check this bar out if you're at The District!"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks back with 4 friends. We actually were gonna check out Whist Stove next door but there was no room for a 5 person table, luckily the small Due &Proper had 1 table available we could all fit at.   Firstly, I loved the décor. We had great service from a young lady, even though it was quite busy. I had the slider appetizer which was great. I didn't like much of the speciality drinks on the menu except 1 which was the Madame Victorian, so I got that and thought it was pretty good. Also got the pretzel sticks which I was excited to get because they had a peanut butter dip. I've always but peanut butter on my soft pretzels and wished places would carry that as a dip choice and finally found a place BUT unfortunately I did not like their peanut butter. Too gourmet I guess for me. So I just used the other dips they had which were fine.  All in all, I had fun and would definitely return:-)"}
{"text":"Ambience looks great but customer service was horrible. We came in and there was no hostess. So we sat down at a table. There were customers at the bar and appeared to be having a good time. We waited for 10 minutes, but no one came to greet us, so we left this place."}
{"text":"This place is great! The atmosphere is fun.  I love the wallpaper.  The food is amazing.  Try the soft pretzels! The Irish nachos are great and the chicken wings are interesting! Great drinks!"}
{"text":"This is an edgy bar hang out spot.  Each of the two martini's had been a bit off in terms of flavor.  Would not go back for them again.  There are better alternatives in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"love the atmosphere the service is a hit or miss. more of a miss miss :/  bro-y vibe. bad customer service. its a shame bc the booths are so comfy food is overpriced for the rehaeted frozen stuff they r serving   ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Due and proper has the best happy hour, early and late night! Light bites and craft cocktails that are approachable,delicious and well balanced. This is  great date spot with decor that is truly a conversation starter. The staff are personable and attentive. I'll definitely be back with my girlfriends after a long day of shopping at the district. Thanks due and proper,  I tip my hat to ya !"}
{"text":"The unique bevvies are a great reason to frequent Due & Proper, and smoke free video poker is another! This combo is one of my favorite pairings in the scorching dead of Vegas summer. They have a rotating selection of draft brews and two Happy Hours that include small plates such as sliders, deviled eggs and nachos. They added tacos not too long ago with an awesome hot salsa & the carnitas were very good.  Gotta check out their \"shot\" wheel or whatever they call it- a giant wheel 'o drinks that I believe is $9 to spin & drink what you \"win\".  Plenty of seating is available in the dining/drinking area, and the funky decor grows on you.  The outdoor seating is picnic tables and you can play some beanbag game that I'm sure everyone younger than me is familiar with. When the joint first reopened, service was spotty and drove me batty so I stayed away for a while. They are now doing a pretty wonderful job of   taking care of the gamers, as it should be, and all is right in the world for the time being here."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Cocktails kinda suck. Pretty decent beer list. My friend says the food sucks. So there ya go."}
{"text":"Seems like reviews are pretty mixed here, but I completely enjoyed my time at this bar! Growing up in Henderson I spent a lot of time at the district and coming back after moving away I get to see just how much it has grown! Adding a bar that fit the environment of the district was a wonderful idea. My boyfriend and friend stopped by here towards the end of the last World Series game. They had some very large tvs to watch and enjoy the game and really fun patrons who made any stranger feel welcome. We ordered drinks and they did not disappoint whatsoever. It was awesome to see the bartenders interacting with everyone in such a fun way, and cheering along with the rest of us for the Cubs (cmon, everyone wanted the cubs to win!). When the game ended and the bar cleared out a little we got to talk to some of the bartenders for awhile and they were an absolute blast. It's fun being in a place where people seem to genuinely enjoy their job and want to make sure everyone has a good time from the moment they walk in to the moment they leave."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived at almost 8pm on a Friday night. All of the regular seating was full, but there were seats at the bar so we chose those. The first bartender who greeted us was great, happy and helpful but maybe almost a little too intense. However, I would rather have had him all night than the miserable bartender who took over for him.   We ordered the Madame Victoria (blueberry cocktail) and the first bartender told me it was a very popular seller. When we got them, we were less than thrilled. It was like it was too sweet, but too tangy at the same time, very strange. I'm not one for re-ordering so I sucked it down and that was that. My friend however couldn't bring herself to finish hers, therefore left her glass over half empty. She ordered another drink instead, and when he finally took her blueberry nonsense away, he said \"no refunds\" and dumped the drink into the trash. How about, \"I'm so sorry you didn't like it, let me make you something else\" or, knowing that I am drinking the same cocktail, dump it in my glass instead of the trash can.   I had ordered the Pretzel Sticks, with cheese fondue which were good, but nothing I can't live without or make myself. We were enjoying those, when another friend joined us. She ordered a burger which she seemed to enjoy, and I tried a french fry which was pretty delicious. We decided we needed some more pretzels to share, but the bartender (semi-jokingly) said that I had gotten the last order. First, they are pretzels, second, it is pretty early on a Friday night, third, I would imagine they are a pretty popular menu item, so running out seemed like a joke to me. Not to mention, if you are out of something, how about you ask us if we want to try something else? So literally, we took this comment as a joke.  When a half an hour later rolled around and we still had no pretzels, we realized he was being serious.  Now it's time to pay. Our order wasn't too complicated, so you would think splitting checks wouldn't be too complicated either. You know what we ordered, we want to put it on our own credit cards, just take care of it. One of the girls explained this to him, but instead, he took the check back that he had already presented and said \"Ok then let me just split the check\". He returned with three separate checks and of course we were already handing over our money so we could leave. I paid cash, but they must not believe in cents at this establishment because I did not receive mine. Please Sir, keep the $0.43 cents.  Overall: Decor is really cute, trendy, love the chandeliers and the space itself (which is the only reason I gave a second star). Menu is pretty limited both food and cocktail/beer/wine, they could definitely do better especially with the drinks. There were a couple of things I was debating between on the food menu, but nothing looked like I needed to go back for and couldn't get somewhere else. I expect FAR more from a place that is associated with Commonwealth and Blvd. Cocktail Company. Frankly I was disgusted with the service and couldn't get out of there fast enough."}
