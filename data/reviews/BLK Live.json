{"text":"BLK, when you advertise that you have happy hour Monday-Friday from 4-7, don't turn away customers that arrive for a Friday happy hour and tell them you aren't having happy hour that day.???really???and then hand them a $50.00 per person menu.  No thanks.  Won't ever go back there again. I used to tell everyone what a great happy hour BLK Live has, but NEVER again.  A friend and I took our husbands out for happy hour to celebrate their birthdays.  My friends were going there for the first time.  Not a good first impression.  Wow, you guys must be making a fortune to be able to turn customers away like that.  I don't know any other food establishment in competition with the Quarter and Kierland, that would ever turn anyone away."}
{"text":"I went to BLK Live for the first time this past Sunday. Admission was free. It was crowded, and the inadequate number of food servers was painfully obvious. I ordered the grilled chicken entree. After 20+ minutes, I was given a plate with a half-breast of chicken and some lukewarm, lumpy make-believe mashed potatoes. Nothing else. Mediocre, at best. Next time I go there, I'll be sure to eat at home first. 

My takeaway: nice place, good band, good sound system, lotsa dancing space, lousy food, poor service."}
{"text":"Story time: Went to BLK for the first time last weekend for a guys day. My friends and I were the first ones there at noon when they opened and we got a cabana and two bottle of vodka. There was NO ONE else there for three straight hours, but we didn't mind too much as well had plenty of alcohol between the four of us. The COPA America championship game (Argentina vs Chile) started at 5pm so a friend and I watch the game from the pool while we drank. Well the game went to extra time and then to penalty kicks, so there was probably 10 minutes left in the match. It was 8pm and they were about to close and asked us to leave. I pleaded with the staff to let us stay for 10 mote minutes to watch the end of the game, but they weren't having it. I asked to speak to a manager and he did't seem to care that we spent over $700 that day and just wanted to see the game finale. Anyway, they kicked us out and we missed the end of the game. I'LL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE. THEY TREAT THEIR PATRONS LIKE GARBAGE. THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY THEN TELL YOU TO GET THE HELL OUT.

p.s. The shrimp cocktail was awful and the cocktail sauce was made from tomato paste. WTF?

EDIT: Rocco the manager responded. FYI: This was on the 26th, not the 19th which was father's day. The lack of people wasn't really a problem anyway, it was how we were treated after being there from open to close. The staff told us they closed the pool at 8pm, not 7 (Nothing on your website about pool hours, only says you're open until 2am). They did NOT let us stay for any extra time what so ever. The drinks were done hours before and we we're just watching the end of the game, which we didn't get to see."}
{"text":"Never been here other than a company event, and it was really nice. Had a blast, bartenders were forgettable, but food and live music were great!"}
{"text":"This is a great, eclectic \"hidden\" hideout in N Scottsdale near the Scottsdale Quarter. The staff - special shout out to \"Rob\" a bartender/mixologist \"par excellence\" - exceptional with the \"mescal\". Love the ambience of this place. Top notch chef back in the fold providing culinary excellence at a reasonable price point. 

Definitely give this place a visit. 

There's even a pool area for an afternoon break.  We're coming back for a concert- 80's band from the past. Should be fun. 

D."}
{"text":"I was here Sat night.. I had a great time! Wonderful customer service, delicious food with reasonable prices and the music was great!! I definitely recommend this place and they even have a pool!!! Honestly, very nice atmosphere and I would come any other day of the week, since they're open 7days a week!!"}
{"text":"This gorgeous venue is just a stone's throw away from Scottsdale Quarter but far enough off of the beaten path that it likely doesn't get much of the Quarter's natural traffic, and it's new enough that it's not hugely known yet. (YET.) I assume most of the people who happen upon it organically thus far are Airpark traffic who drive past it every day and decide to finally give it a shot.

It's actually extremely easy to find...when I looked up the address to drive there, I thought it might be *inside* the Quarter and anticipated having to find parking in the garage, but I was quite pleased to find that it's a little farther east and has its own parking.

I showed up very early (like, two and a half hours) last night for a show I thought started at 8 but actually started at 10. (\"Blaze of Jovi\" -- a Bon Jovi tribute band, if you couldn't discern that from the name.) My pops was chatting with some of his associates at the (main?) bar, so I chilled there for a bit, and then we headed into the indoor stage area and sat at that bar. I wasn't sure I was going to stay long enough for the 10pm show, but we really wanted to check them out so we ended up staying, and I'm glad we did! There were actually hardly any guests there in the beginning, since it was raining a ton and Phoenicians don't know how to function well when water is falling from the sky, but more people showed up as the band got going, so that was good. (Side note--I have to say that Blaze of Jovi were fantastic and a lot of fun and kept their energy up in the face of a rained-out night; I hope this doesn't deter them from coming back to Phoenix!)

The decor is really neat, paying homage to many musicians...there are guitars hanging on some of the walls, and images of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, etc. The outside looked really cool too with its pool, 'big' stage, and cabanas all around (I think the cabanas had some of these images too, but I was hiding from the rain and not paying too much attention to detail while outside, so I may not be remembering it properly). I should have taken a lot more pictures, but all I got was the stage when the band was just starting to play. I'm sure this place will be killer when the weather warms up...I'm not a pool party person, but I would absolutely come and check out some music out there.

Since it was not busy, we had a little time to chat with the bartender Lily, who is a really cool chick. She's kind of new to the area, so go introduce yourself and give her your local input! :) I also got to meet Daniel, Jared, and Marinela throughout the night, all of whom are lovely and I hope I spelled their names correctly. The whole staff actually seems very welcoming and friendly, which is always big to me. (I hate going to a place where I feel like you couldn't care less if I'm there. I'll take my measly business elsewhere, thanks!) One of the patrons (and her husband) was just an absolute doll, too!

I was not at all hungry, but I wish I had been. So, I cannot speak yet as to any of the food, but I will definitely go back and have dinners/lunches at some point...and apparently I will have to share the S'mores-esque dessert, which I hear is incredible and big enough for 4 people.

I don't make it to the Scottsdale area often and I have very little patience for the Old-Town club vibe and crowd...but I do still have a lot of family and friends in the area, and I would love to make this place our go-to spot to meet up. It is classy and stunning with a very down-to-earth feel and cool people. Hard to beat that!"}
{"text":"So sitting here bored to death waiting for anyone to start playing an instrument. Tickets said 7pm not 830 ish....Food was just fair as well. Soggy fries. Waste of my Friday night. Maybe Berlin will actually play sometime soon."}
{"text":"As excited as I was for this place to open I was so so disappointed in my experience. We showed up opening night and it wasn't too busy so we posted up at the pool bar towards the back. The bartender was unknowledgable. Didn't know what beers they had. What their vodka selection was and on top of that wasn't personable at all. He was more interested in conversing with other bartenders than us or the other patrons at the bar. Opening nights are always disorganized as I've opened a few bars myself but it's all about how you service the customers. I can handle an unknowledgable staff but I won't return to a rude staff. Hope all the kinks get worked out but not sure if we'd return."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with co workers. I had pork belly dish with a maple bourbon and peach glaze, and Mac n cheese. It was amazing. Someone had meatloaf, another had a burger. We were all impressed and plan on going back."}
{"text":"Updating to 4 stars. After we got the sitter thing figured out we were actually quite impressed with the facility and the show as fantastic. It reminded me of a college bar but nicer with a pool!

Only thing I'd recommend is they speak out the first band starting time."}
{"text":"The band (Berlin) was great.  The venue seems nice but I don't think they are up to handling a concert sized crowd.  They lack parking, service by the pool is non existent, the wait for food was an hour, and after a drunk threw up in the pool ... it was just left there.  It really kills the poolside atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy music outside by the pool or to have a nice dinner inside the restaurant. LILY a bartender at the outside bar is always a delight to see. She is fantastic! Very friendly staff and a good atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Cool bar food service was LESS THAN ONE star! When I ordered the food I told her I have a severe gluten intolerance she even checked two more items and came back then she gave me my salad full of croutons lol it was supposed to be a chicken Caesar 35 minutes later I get my chicken caesar which the chicken is charred black. They charged me $15 GROSS black chicken, Horrible service my whole table was mad. A guy came over and saw we were talking to the manager about the food service the guy who did not know ud, said \"I bet if you  bought these girls around of drinks (there was three of us ladies) that they'd be happier\"  and the manager said \"I'll think about it\"  and never did and walked away..m we  NOT be going back there again with my group of friends.  Bad service is the worst"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. All tables are high top with metal chairs which were not too comfortable on the derriere.  Food good,  some had the meatloaf others had the pork tenderloin. Tasty but those that have a bigger appetite might find the portions small though the presentations of the food were beautiful.
The outside bar and pool very nice. The bar has many TVs, great for watching a game."}
{"text":"I thought restaurant was excellent I wife and I had the classic BLK hamburgers ask them to make it a double patty no problem the Kobe beef in the hamburger meat was absolutely to die for it was delicious five stars for the meet service was good until the end didn't want to bring back my change but the whole thing was his tip but it wasn't took it personally he did oh well too bad still tipped over 20% manager was very nice never complained about having anythingOverall five stars and the food was great and other things on the menu it's all Kobe beef wasn't in a rush so service was mediocre speed it was fine"}
{"text":"Thankfully the reviews warned us of the slow kitchen and service.   We arrive 2 hours before the show and had to have dessert delivered into the concert....but the food was good ! The music awesome!"}
{"text":"Worse place in Scotsdale, AZ. Looks like fun...but the waitress ...ohhh was beyond bad, food had good taste and would have been better if it did not take 1 hr plus to get food. Beer was warm.  I waitress 2 bartenders there were about 25 people there. Will NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"Their new executive chef as well as their upgraded staff, the food here has changed to amazingly affordable and an out of this world taste experience. The Waygu Sliders are the perfect texture and seasoning with just the right balance of vegetables. I couldn't be happier. The staff is always extremely nice and the drinks are made almost flawlessly. Happy hour is definitely a must and their Tuesday night events are always so much fun! Their themed events on Fridays and Saturdays are also something to check out because you can go swim as well! High End fine dining at an affordable price and tons to do and see plus swimming. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We went to see the Rat Pack show Friday June 23. We had never been there before and were surprised to see about 10 people with security shirts on.  It was a little intimidating and we were curious as to why they were needed .The show was supposed to be inside where they have a stage set up and a big bar. There was very limited seating and they had to bring lounge chairs in from outside in order to try to accommodate all the people who paid for the show. Since there wasn't enough seating people were standing and so you couldn't see the stage.  It was a very poorly planned event which they obviously are not equipped to handle. The size of the room was ample but it wasn't set up for a comedy show at all! We will not go back."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun tonight for Chase Bryant. The after party with one of the top bartenders in Arizona Conner McGhee topped off the night. So many delicious cocktails. The Old Fashion was the best I have ever had. Smoked glass and amazing balances."}
{"text":"Conner the bartender is the absolute best. Go there and have a fun time.  And Jared is the shit too."}
{"text":"What's all the hype..? Sure it's cool to have a pool with a bar and nice \"restaurant\" but honestly I have experienced A LOT better. My bartender was terrible, she was rude and didn't care about her guests. Been here twice since they have opened and my experience keeps getting worse. Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Excellent service and very attentive. We rented a Cabana for the first time and I highly recommend going that route. Very nice and comfy and you get your own waitress. Lara and Rocco were amazing to work with in scheduling the Cabana and tailoring to our needs."}
{"text":"Fun place, the service was great BUTTTTTT the food was terrible and cold.  You'd think for the pricy menu the food would be great.  Not sure what was going on but there hardly any customers in the dining area.  The back ground music was excellent and the volume was such that it was easy to have a conversation without having to yell at each other.  My recommendations would be to go have a drink at BLK with your date or friends, listen to some great music, then go dine elsewhere.  THEN go back to BLK for an adult beverage and continue the \"tunes\"..."}
{"text":"Had so much fun at the Red, White & Blue Bash for veterans on 11/11/17.
Lovely facility, friendly employees, good food, nice ambiance. 
Thanks for a nice evening!"}
{"text":"I've visited four times.  I've really tried to like this place, but the vibe is very snobbish and there have never been many people in the place.  Maybe it's different if a concert is going, but we've tried lunch, dinner and two happy hours.  Food is good, though prices seem on the high side for what you get.  Some of the bartenders are friendly, but there is always a group of people that appear to either work there or are just hanging out with management...they keep to themselves and overall give the place an unwelcoming feel."}
{"text":"This venue is spectacular. Very spacious and I would love to come here during the summer, great for pool parties. I came for the Scottsdale Homeowner Release Party and it was the perfect spot to mingle with friends. The set up was perfect, they had the misters going which is wonderful because it was 110 outside. Great spot, will go back soon!"}
{"text":"The only thing better than the BLK beef, is Jarod's personality and mixology skills!!  Fantastic service, great food, and a hot date-what more can you ask for!!!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much just a concert venue review, since I probably wouldn't eat at a place like this (after looking at menu).


I recently saw a show here after being skeptical on it. To be perfectly honest with you, having a pool that close to the stage was kind of unappealing, it just doesn't make sense to me (especially shows in late Fall and Winter). With non seating chart venues, I always try to get as early as I can to try to get front by stage. So there was only a few feet of standing room in front of the pool (a good 20-30 people can fit in there) and there's a tower of speakers on each side of the stage that could potentially obstruct the view of people standing at the sides. I got towards the front against the railing, so I was good.

The stage itself is pretty small (no problem though, I love small venues) and the railing is pretty close to it. Also it's not very tall, so I imagine people in the pool have a crappy view.

The sound systems were decent, actually better than I expected. There were times when the main mic's had problems but they fixed it right away. Both bands sounded decent, sound quality wise.

The front area did get pretty crowded, since people try to budge in to get in the front. That's one of the big knocks on this venue. This venue felt like a big party with a concert stage. Everyone was focused on getting drinks and hanging with their friends at the bar rather than seeing a show (just seemed that way), and not one person went in the pool so it got crowed all over the place.

By the way, the parking (good thing it was free) is kind of a downer. We got there pretty early (for the show) but there was only a few spots open in the parking lot because it was filled with people for the restaurant, etc. They do have valet, but no clue how much it is since we didn't even bother. The parking lot isn't really built for a capacity crowd concert, so get there early.

Overall, it's not a terrible venue, but between the limited parking spaces and a big pool taking up a lot of space, there's better small clubs and venues out there. I'm willing to see another show here though since they're getting a lot of these 80's bands, but it's really not my preferred small venue. I'm not a big drinker or even a bar guy, so when I go to shows, I'm there for a good show."}
{"text":"This Club is a real Grown and Sexy Club...very impressed. We will definitely be returning..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and the pool parties are awesome, the food is nothing short of amazing, service is quick and accurate and the staff is always polite and handle situations accordingly.  You will never please everyone but they try their best and I will continue to frequent this place. Lily and Sarah were awesome out back and the best waitresses!"}
{"text":"Really nice inside and cool with a pool in the back! Pretty hip bar/restaurant but food prices are too high. Other than that, i liked the place. It would be a good lunch place for the businesses around them if they market some \"lunch\" specials."}
{"text":"Update:

Quiet riot show.... BLK live kicked it up a notch and rocked it!

CONGRATS TO BLK!!!



Update:  keep reading till bottom......

WAS Digging on this place for the last few months since they've started the 'hair bands' playing. Decent prices, good sound, above avg prices in drinks.  No longer dog them. Here's why: 

Have changed my opinion due to a very easily resolvable issue, that unfortunately the manager refused to resolve. I was honest about the miscommunication among friends about how many tickets we originally pre purchased.  We purchased an extra at the door. 2 minutes after we purchased the extra ticket the door lady said no problem, what here and the manager will help you with a refund. 

After waiting for 20 minutes (no exaggeration -and missing some of the music), manager finally arrived. I openly and politely told him the scenario; we accidentally purchased 1 extra ticket. He refused to refund but offers tickets to upcoming shows that I advised I had already purchased since I dig the venue. Instead of recognizing the continued patronage and thanking me for that, then




 refunding 30$, he advised there is nothing he can do... as the manager there is nothing he can do. Seemed odd he didn't offer a a free drink (or 2), or simply the cash back.. which was the obvious choice since I'd spend it at the bar.... but no. He advised he was sorry but there was nothing he could do... such as goto the door person, get the cash I gave them, and give it back to me, he tried to walk away. I reminded him I have tickets to all upcoming (2018) bike week shows (I've proven my patronage), and he said sorry and walked away. 

Very poorly ran and obviously more concerned about revenue versus continued patronage/positive happy customers.   So in short, I won't purchase more tickets from this venue. 

Good luck to those who do. Was a very simple resolution. But $30 was worth more than future revenue. 





Update:
Spoke to Rocco who did what was right..... refunded the unused ticket, made up for it with good conversation, like a regular ole person, made me and my friends feel at home. Invited us back for future fun and just hung out for a moment. 

We will be back now that he treated us right! He also advised he is working w his staff to mold then into customer satisfaction minded folks. Shared future plans for the venue, and was just a down to earth person.  

Great role mode for the staff Rocco!

We'll see ya at bike week (ZZ Top) for sure plus Frank Hannon (of Tesla) and for sure Quiet Riot. 

The simple act of treating us as decent people and refunding a measly $30 gained BLK Live future business w VIP $$, drink $$ and drink $$, word of mouth and overall great reviews.   Keep it up Rocco & gang!"}
{"text":"Don't go here for the over-priced and badly cooked food.  Myself and a friend went there on a Wednesday (a non-music night) just to have dinner since we heard they have Kobe beef. I got the ribeye med-rare and my friend got the fillet medium. Both meals showed up cold; meat, potato, vegetable...all cold.  The fillet was thick and cooked correctly, but still cold.  My ribeye was ridiculously thin rendering it impossible to cook med-rare.  I sent it back, and got another incredibly thin ribeye and still over cooked. Their argument is that they receive a cut of beef, and cut off 14oz. which results in a wide thin steak.  This is obviously not a foodie place since it was just us and two other couples in the entire restaurant for the time we were there. BLK Live is more of a music venue with overpriced high end food, that is nowhere near high end; drinks are overpriced as well."}
{"text":"We just hosted an event there last night and I have to say that the experience was incredible.   From top to bottom their service was top notch.  The planning process was smooth and easy.  The day of the event they were fully staffed and everyone was super friendly and helpful. All my guests were treated like VIP's.  I would highly recommend them anyone wanting to host a cool event."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  We went to see Next perform and it was so classy.  The environment is really nice and clean. The bartenders were friendly and helpful.  They had the stage set up really cool next to the pool. Very romantic scene.  We sat in the cabanas outside and had the best time.  The food was even good.  Loved everything about this place.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Thanx Rocco.
I did not know there were other restrooms on the property. I figured there had to be...not just one with only 2 stalls. 
Thank you for replying"}
{"text":"Our first night at BLK Live this week.  Comments are meant to be constructive to help the place improve it has a lot of potential! Beautiful location and night lights with the pool make it a cool place to see a band. Maybe find a way to fill in part of the pool to allow more space by the stage.  We arrived early to dine and the filets and asparagus were five stars. The service group is a little green overall and I would like to see these skills sharpened especially for Scottsdale area. We asked if we could \"transfer\" our drinks to dinner table and they said yes, but then brought a bar tab and asked us to go back and pay at the bar. That's not what \"transfer\" means. 

We did wait for our order to be taken 10 min. That was a little disappointing as we were about the only ones in room. Someone came to pick up my extra empty water glass and said \"is this OK?\" I said \"yes\" and they also grabbed my half glass of wine and I had to stop them.  If they just tweak a few areas in the set up this would get a five from us."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for lunch yesterday. Looked like only one bartender/ server working....Andre, I think. He was very attentive...I ordered the chicken and donuts... It was AMAZING! Presentation was beautiful. Some nice craft beers on tap, but I didn't partake. My friend had the shrimp cocktail... Looked delicious.....but I don't eat seafood. She loved it.... ordered it twice! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. I was there before when it was a different venue and wasn't really blown away. Still have the same feeling about it. I sat at the bar inside (it was hot, no ac on) and ordered some sliders. I felt at $12 on happy hour they were a bit overpriced and the size of the meat was tiny. The sliders were tasty, a bit over cooked though. The fries were nice. The bartender messed the order up a bit but was very nice and took care of it right away. He was good. I felt like the place was a bit understaffed as he was the only one serving a pretty much full bar at 4pm. I ordered a Dos Equis beer that was supposed to be on tap but it was actually out of a can and not very cold.

I am pretty sure Tito Jackson was at the other end of the bar. He rolled up in a Rolls Royce and had people all around him.

All in all, I would give this place another chance but wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"The acoustics are very good. The band was excellent.  If you're going for just the music, get there early and sit on the couches in the front or pay for VIP booths. Other than that, this place was mediocre to bad. 

The restaurant. The place was half full on a Saturday night and it took 15 minutes to get someone at our table to take our order. The food took around 40 minutes. I ordered a burger which was actually not bad but cold, fries were cold and soggy. My friend's ribs and polenta were about the worst thing I've seen served up in a while. I hope it was microwaved because it got cold in the window. That would explain the rock hard, jawbreaker size chunks in the polenta and uneven temperature. The spare ribs had the taste and texture of day old, cold roast beef. 

It was pretty awful. 

The club is pretty cool with the pool, bar and VIP areas. I was impressed. The patio seating looked comfortable but we were unable to sit. The problem is the seating. the bar doesn't have enough stools to go around it for seating and most of the tables around were without stools. If you're not on the couches or at the bar, you're standing, even at a table. They should invest in more chairs. 

I would go see another show here. I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Well, this place was interesting. The bar area is very upscale Scottsdale and very expensive when it comes to drinks and food. The waiters, mainly male wait staff which is fine, are wearing ties and pressed shirts. Very well kept and clean. Moving out into the concert area it's a relaxed atmosphere with open type of bar and a pool with a tall waterfall. Seating was very limited for the concert we attended, although there was plenty of seating for the VIP section and not many VIPs. I would think they would bring some of the chairs and seatng over to the \"poor people\" side so that some of us did not have to just sit on the ground or stand for the entire concert. Another disappointment was that they charged $5 for parking when there is plenty of free parking around the area. It just seems like it was one more thing they tried to money grab. I guess we would go back for a concert if we had to, but I would pass when it comes to drinks or food. There are other places that might be more enjoyable. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"I saw a reggae show here and was pretty impressed by how great they were able to keep it cool at an outdoor summer arizona show. 
The only thing that was strange was all of the advertisements for happy hour after 9 on show nights that weren't honered by any bars out there. We literally pointed to the electronic advertisement by our table and were told that \"'maybe\" it's in the restaurant. Prices are pretty high but bartenders are very attentive. I'm sure I'll be back but next time I'll know about drinks which might make my rating higher lol"}
{"text":"This place is top notch! I went there for 2 of their shows and it was amazing. This place is truly Disneyland when it comes to the decor and setup. Props to all the staff for keeping up with the hundreds of peeps they deal with. I had the spicy tuna roll and chicken Caesar salad. A+. Will be back for some of the other shows."}
{"text":"The best thing about our meal at BLK is that our group of 14 will forever remember it as the worst meal and service we have ever had.  The only meals that weren't over cooked were the ones that they got completely wrong.  The only server who tended to our table was one of the members of our party.  We aren't sure how a margarita could possibly taste spoiled, but kudos to BLK Live because they figured it out.  Sorry, I misspoke earlier when I said everything was overcooked.  A few dishes were either cold or just tasted gross.  

All of that said, the Brussel Sprouts were decent.  So if u go there.....just get that."}
{"text":"I don't get this place at all. It's like someone went crazy on Pinterest with ideas. The decor combines rustic with glam but not well. The waitstaff is dressed like its a 5 Star restaurant and while there are wine glasses on the table when you're seated, there is no wine list. The menus are printed on cheap glossy paper and are poorly designed making them hard to decipher. The Easter-yellow napkins do not go with the orange upholstered booths. Details are overlooked, but hey, there are walls with fake grass inserts. 
We came in a party of 4. Two got the pork chop, which looked good until we saw how pink it was on the inside. They were sent back. I ordered the scallops, but they didn't come with much of a side  (smear of butternut squash and small pile of canned fennel) so I ended up ordering food at the next bar we went to in order to satiate my hunger. The fourth ordered the meatloaf, which he enjoyed. I had a vodka soda, but the well here is something terrible so I didn't finish it. The server tried but it was obvious he was pretty new. 
The pool area was roped off and when we left a terrible sounding cover band was making quite the racket. No one we mentioned this place to even knew what we were talking about, which may explain why it was empty.  I wouldn't waste my time, there are much better options available in the area."}
{"text":"Food and cocktails good, atmosphere very nice, Meatloaf yummy, burgers great, Salmon ok, could have had more flavor....but all in all great venue and fun with friends!!"}
{"text":"Blown AWAY!   Don't know why it took me so long to find this place, but off the hook happy that I did.   What a fantastic outdoor small venue for concert.  We started with apps and dinner and forked out the bucks for the poolside VIP table and didn't bat an eye on the price after the experience we had.  (Highly recommend) We were graciously served by CC and Kelsey during the concert and by Jonah while dining. And the host/mgr Jerred was the perfect concierge for the evening. We will be back and will bring friends. Thank you for making all of us feel welcome!  What a wonderful night.  PS. Jay and the cool Looking bartender were pretty smooth too."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful.. Its perfect for Arizona summers and Scottsdale adventures haha. If you got family, friends in town and wanna swim and drink and eat great food without doing it all yourself this place is amazing for that but the problem with it is they are slacking on people. If this place was actually busy on a Sunday this place would be incredible! The food is fantastic the beers on the other hand you're gonna give me a 6$ beer in a small can?? Not even glass? Or a jug? Or something better.. but I can get a Moscow mule for like two dollars more which contains way more liquor??.. something wrong on that part haha. This place is nice and the food is great but nobody is there to support it.. if they maybe get better events on their schedule maybe this place will kick off."}
{"text":"This review is for the 2017 New Year's Eve Celebration. Mostly positive experience, but if you bought the $50 general admission ticket, the BLK higher-ups kind of made us regular folks feel like we only \"sorta\" belonged at their party. I don't know who those people were (maybe Rocco knows), but the normal staff on that night was great and very welcoming. 

The VIP people obviously had priority on this night. We got kicked out of a few tables near the stage to make way for \"potential\" bottle buyers. The only other seats were out back far away from stage either near the pool or at back bar. The only other negative was that despite having an entire restaurant available, they only chose to serve the party people two lousy sandwiches. Not sure why they couldn't cook a burger and bring it out, but the Sloppy Joe and Pulled Pork sandwiches with Doritos bags were like slaps in the face, especially if you came here hungry.

Otherwise, it was a pretty good night. The open bar was as advertised for two hours, we got a champagne toast at midnight and the staff handed out hats and horns. Both the bands were good, including the headliner, the Spazmatics. The place wasn't too crowded, so overall the positives outweighed the negatives and we had fun. Many others though were vomiting in bathrooms and outside, so in that respect, it was another typical New Year's Eve."}
{"text":"Visiting, I tried this place out as it was open. BAD mistake. It's looks trendy, and I'm sure it's trendy and nice when it's warm out but DO NOT EAT HERE. the worst burger I have had. Just because you grill on your logo on the bun doesn't make it OK. I had a HAIR in my drink when I first ordered an old fashion. Then they forgot my side dish which had another hair on it but this time it was their cooking brush apparently. Whatever ..$3 off my tab and a burger that had way too much pepper, not tender, no real taste and hair in my food. You lose. Stay away"}
{"text":"I have been unimpressed with blk live in the past but wow- the Andy Grammer concert was lit. The night was sponsored by pandora and jeep. The night was great. Andy killed it. Open bar. The pool is beautiful right in the middle. It was by far the best night I have had a BLK Live. In the past I've found BLK Live to be slow and the drinks are expensivel. Hopefully they have more nights like this."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for lunch today by the pool. We ate the Classic BLK Burger and the Bourbon Burger. Both were delicious, as well as our margaritas and cold beers. The staff was super friendly which complimented the fun atmosphere. Management came by to see how we were doing and if we needed anything. They are really running the place efficiently. Excited to visit again when there is a pool party! Well done."}
{"text":"Let me just say this.... Check this place out for yourself and YOU will see why it should be 5+ stars:- Seriously
 
The burger was soooo yummy, the freshness of the meat and melting cheese mmmm so delicious 

Sitting by the pool was so relaxing and chilled 

Waitress was so sweet and polite, recommend some of popular items and gave us plenty of time to pick and chose:-


Bring someone \"special\" here:-"}
{"text":"This review is based on drinks as I did not have the opportunity to try the food. There is a very limited selection for vegetarians and the entrees ran upwards of $20-$30.

I had the BLK Old Fashioned. The bartender that made it deserves a 5/5 stars. He was off the charts amazing! He gave us the whole experience: sniffing the bottle, tasting the ingredients, etc. It was worth paying $11 a drink for his service. 

We ordered another round that was made by the girl that was there and the cocktails weren't nearly as good or well crafted. He really knocks it out of the park. I don't recall his name but he is a very polite and funny bald man that could open his own bar he's so fantastic. Will be coming back solely because of him. 

The ambiance is interesting. It was a crowd of 45+ with a few 20 somethings hidden. I wanted to watch the game so they changed the aquarium into a TV. The live music was acoustic and pleasant in the bar area. 

I'd be interested to come back during a full blown concert and hang out in the pool. Not typically a place I'd frequent but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst live venue I've experienced anywhere in the world and I've been to some real shit-holes. Never actually got to see the inside of the venue because we waited in line for over an hour and missed 1 1/2 bands because they had ZERO clue how to get people inside, take tickets and arrange a proper will-call for people who already paid! Whomever is in charge of running the entertainment at this venue should be appalled and deeply embarrassed at how horrible of a job they are doing and should be fired IMMEDIATELY!!! 

I have worked in the music industry for 18 years now Worldwide and have never been treated with such disrespect and seen such chaos and anger from paying guests. 

I will NEVER come back to this venue...ever!!!


Shame on you guys. Absolutely horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Normally I come here a lot! Last night they had a band called the Bandaleros (whom I love) playing all night. My friends booked the biggest cabana there for the night. After a long night of fun, dancing and drinking, it was time to close our tab. Shy was very attentive and polite. When I paid my bill, my wallet must have fell out of my purse into my seat without me knowing. 

This morning I called four times, there was no answer. I had to drive back to see if it fell out which if did. Thankfully someone turned in my wallet BUT also stole $80 of my cash. Now we were the last to leave besides the band so it is very likely that an employee turned in the wallet but stole my cash. After his much I spend and all my friends too, I am surprised that this person can be so dishonest. And I'm not saying Shy is the one that did it, no way! Just whoever cleaned up the area or did the last run through as the band left!"}
{"text":"The hostess? Manager? was really non specific and rude.

Incredibly unprofessional and resulted in a sale loss.

Music venue is cool maybe they could work on timing a bit better to keep the audience happy.


Tip: if you're going to want drinks or food before a concert at BLK just walk over to a different bar."}
{"text":"This is by far the best venue I've ever been to in my 47 years of life for a small show. The staff at the front is very courteous and security is top notch. Lilly at the bar is cute as a button and they are polite. My beer wasn't cold and they gave me another free at no charge. J Rock the General Manager has been in service industry for 30 plus years. The ticket taker gave me two tickets to Frank Hannon from Tesla. I asked to swap for Lynch Mob. He let me keep the Hannon ones and gave me Lynch Mob. There's a pool in the middle of floor which makes it a unique venue. Drinks and food are affordable too. I'm telling everyone this is no fake post. If you want to see your favorite band in a small setting this is by far the best place to see a show."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times since they first opened. I'm a ridiculously picky eater and a serious foodie. That means I'm going to scrutinize the whole experience much more than most people.

The food is very good as is the service. When they first opened, they were out of something I wanted but they went out of their way to find another menu item that I liked. 

I went back on my birthday last August for Happy Hour and had a really good time. They serve Tito's vodka and their Moscow Mule in served a copper mug. This is the traditional way to serve the Mule, but a lot of places serve the Mule in a glass, and it's just not as good that way because the copper keeps the drink extra cold.

The next time I go I'll take photos. I just wanted to post a positive review because the location is off the beaten path...but the environment is so cool, especially in the bar/outside area, it's worth seeking this place out."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome, but I paid 24$ for 2 scallops and service was slow. Only coming back for the live music, not eating here again"}
{"text":"Another fun night at BLK.   Ask for Rocco he knows how to party!!!  Good drinks , food and fun."}
{"text":"Don't show up hungry to this place!!! Wait times are 2 plus hours for standard fare type entree's. Oh, and when you get your food, it's not fresh or even warm. 
The venue was awesome, great wait staff, and Management was understanding, but holy cow!! Excuses like \"It's a new menu or we are working on it only go so far when your starving.\" 
Take
My advice BLK Live, close the kitchen."}
{"text":"Service is EXCEPTIONAL! Live band on Friday Happy Hour was the best I EVER heard!!! Vibe is casual -dressy ... welcome to Scottsdale! We had coconut shrimp, calamari and the BLK burger and fries... so yummy and well prepared and displayed! It was my friends birthday and they surprised her with a scrumptious Carmel piece of heaven for her dessert with a fancy sparkler !!! Thank you BLK for a super fun night! We will definitely be back! Beautiful ambiance and gorgeous back patio with pool!"}
{"text":"Great place to see a concert.  They have brought in so many great bands.  I have been to 13 shows, bands such as Dokken, Slaughter, Warrant, and Winger.  You also get great local bands like Color of Chaos opening.  Awesome sound system.  Great friendly staff with Rocco leading the way.  Keep up the great work.  I want this place around for many years to come."}
{"text":"This was a super chill place for a weekday date night :) cool decor and great views and live music! The service was pretty slow, but the burgers were awesome and our waiter Chris hooked us up with free dessert because of our wait (and the dessert was amazing!!)."}
{"text":"Let me say- I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at BLK Live. When we pulled up the parking lot was quite empty, which sent off red flags for me. However, I came in with a positive mind set. The reception was the sweetest girl ever and seated us 20 min before our reservation. We had a wonderful server, she was very attentive and we asked a few questions about the menu. What she didn't know she went and asked, which I greatly appreciate. The rest of the staff was very kind and attentive too. 

The food was spectacular. The Caesar salad was more than I expected and the coconut shrimp had great flavor. Our waitress suggested the meatloaf, which did not disappoint. My fiancé had the filet and said it was tasty. 

We were too full to have dessert but it sounded great and we will be coming back to try the s'mores! 

Even though there was minimal guests, the restaurant has great decor and I would like to be here on a busy night. We will be coming back to experience the outdoor patio during the summer! 

Our only negative would be the menu, it is quite bare and doesn't explain what the entrees come with. Besides that if you are in Scottsdale give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The drinks here are amazing! Great atmosphere and music, great place to party with friends! Our waitress Sarah was very entertaining and a great cocktail waitress"}
{"text":"We bought tickets for Ty Henderon for my wife's birthday.Great welcoming staff and we got there early for a good seat.The opening entertainer was great and actually played way longer than the main performer.Advertised as a holiday theme? It was more like a self promotion for song sales and playing to his \"special group\".Our server was lacking at the end of the night .Probably because she was off to the side watching the show and dealing with her personal friends .Totally opposite the other server who was busy throughout the night.We had to flag her down to close our tab. Overall we had a good time and met a nice couple we let share our table.We will defiantly come again."}
{"text":"The restaurant, menu, and décor are very interesting.  The menu is still in flux as I understand it, so it may stand to change, on at least certain items.  The outside pool area, bars, and stage are very spread out.  Overall, it was a very entertaining evening."}
{"text":"Love this place! Atmosphere is great, huge TVs, food is amazing (I recommend the Brussels sprouts!) and you can't beat the friendly staff who provides us with great service! Jared even surprised us with some complimentary items which was unexpected, and they were so great we ordered more!!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place is AWESOME!!! If you have never been here, this is a must-go, super-FUN place here in Scottsdale.

The pool & cabanas; LIVE concert music venue; awesome food, and incredible bar makes this a one-of-a-kind entertainment and dining experience. Everyone in our party had a blast. 

The ambiance in itself was very well planned out. If you love music... there is paraphernalia about many of the greatest music legends at every turn, proudly displayed on nearly every wall.

We all ordered something different and we all shared everything. Every dish was delish!

The only thing we missed out on was taking a dip in the HUGE pool. We didn't have our swimsuits. :(

Service was incredible... they checked on our party several times. 

The next time we're back in Scottsdale, THIS is THE PLACE we will certainly return to! HOT BABE'S EVERYWHERE!"}
{"text":"I haven't got there yet and I heard good things about this place, hopefully soon. From the russian. Rocco V. See you soon."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  The pork belly and the sliders  are outstanding.  Drinks are really good and fairly priced, considering the location.  Bartenders are really good and very friendly.  You would be making a mistake not to stop here."}
{"text":"Would be a great venue if they didn't lie to you to get you in there 2 hours before the band starts...maybe to spend your money 
drinking.....bands start at 9pm ...hope they actually show up!!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not all that. Not sure why people are so in to coming here. Food was meh service was horrible. Bartenders are rude. Good thing it will only be busy during the summer. Won't be coming back. Save your time."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this place while on vacation. Staff very well dressed and provided excellent service. No wait for lunch and the food was delicious; perfect seasoning on everything. Unfortunately, I think I had the bottom of the bucket fries because they were soft and had burnt ends and not crunchy like I expected. 
4 Star rating because I had an up charge of $8 for a lettuce Turkey burger because I don't eat very much bread. I would have gladly done without the lettuce or at least been told there would be a charge for my substitution. The waiter was able to get $4 off the up charge. 
Overall experience was great but not sure if I would return due to my $18 Turkey (wrapped lettuce) burger."}
{"text":"This place has potential but they need to lower the prices, raise the quality of the food, and better train their staff."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday raven event.....band was great !  But extremely hot.......they did have water pitchersout with glasses but it seemed like they didn't want to bother with people asking for water.......late in the evening they finally put misters on which helped a lot.  I don't know why they waited so long.  Staff needs a lot of help.....sat at bar and no one bothered to say hi or ask about drinks......staff was not friendly they actually looked mad about something.  Food menu is very sparse not a great selection.......from el Santo they did change decor a lot.   But again not much seating in or out.....1 womans bathroom was broke so only one in use with a line.  I may go again but when it is cooler but its not happening for awhile .  very disappointing and I doubt they will be in business long."}
{"text":"Great woman, Tequila, and Pool Parties.... this place is popping off like no other.... came here after work on a Saturday night and had a blast.  The best place in north scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place, pool, separate bar, 20 somethings, but that can be overlooked. They have some old time musicians there, so the crowds age and the music don't really jive. Owner must be our age. Lol"}
{"text":"Went to see Living Colour at BLK. The only reason I am giving this location 1 star was for the band (who deserves a million!)

We met friends for dinner & the show. Dinner was mediocre at best. After waiting 15 minutes to put in our drink order, we waited another 15 to get them. At this point the bar was not at all crowded. It took another 15 minutes to put in our food order. The server then came back & told us they didn't have one of the appetizers we ordered.  After waiting 40 minutes, our appetizers & meals came out all at once.  The rib appetizer seem to have been cooked several days ago & warmed so they could be served to us today, had no meat on them & too much sauce (to make them appear thicker than they were).  Then we were brought three of another appetizer we didn't order and then $20 burgers were dry, tasteless and a were accompanied by the lamest, soggiest, undercooked fries I have had globally.  They also do not look like anything I have see pictured so far and were served on untoasted english muffins. Though our server was pleasant & helpful, service was slower than slow.  No apologies offered.

We then headed to the (outdoor) pool area where Living Colour did not disappoint. HOWEVER, despite the NO SMOKING signs that were posted, we had the pleasure of choking on so much cigar & cigarette smoke I thought we were sitting in a Casino.  You couldn't get away from it.  I watched idiot after idiot stand next to trash can clearly marked 'no-smoking & 'do not dispose of cigarette in trash' do just that as security & the venue staff watched or provided ash trays. (Can anyone say SAFETY HAZZARD!)  Now I believe AZ smoking laws state & I quote:   \"Swimming Pools - Smoking around outdoor swimming pools is allowed as long as smoke is not infiltrating enclosed areas where smoking is prohibited. Enclosed areas near pools may include offices, snack bars, activity centers, clubhouses, bathrooms, or changing rooms.\"   I also thought it was not allowed anywhere near food of which has being served all around the pool area.  WOW.  I am a former smoker so I usually could care less about this kind of stuff but this was out of control.  No matter where we moved to we choked on cigars...  of which seemed to be popping up on the reg. and may be available for purchase at BLK so hence the loose smoking rules...but cannot confirm for sure. It was to the point of distracting.

The theme of BLK and how it is set up is overall a pretty great concept with a cool vibe.  We were looking forward to enjoying it. But between the horrible food & casino level smoke, there are a lot of better venues to see live music.  My husband, the friends we were with and myself are all musicians & are attend a lot of venues Valley-wide. We would not waste our time or money going back to this one. Truly a shame."}
{"text":"Worse meal ever.   Took forever for water.  Drinks came 1 at a time    Food came for only half the table after hour and half.   We missed the show even though we arrived early for dinner.  Then waitress kept all the money without bringing my change back.  My wine was served in a dirty glass. Never will our party of 12 return"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at BLK. The only thing I didn't like was the parking, way insufficient for shows. But everything else was amazing! The service and atmosphere, and the pool area was beautiful! I didn't eat there, but the drinks were great! I would definitely add more seats, though!"}
{"text":"It's really 2 1/2, but that's as high as I can go. How can I explain?  First, the parking situation is atrocious.  The flow of traffic to the valet is very awkward. Second, the club has events, which is fine, but how they break up the interior of the facility is less than desirable. Third, if you go into the event, be prepared to stand, as seating is very limited. 

That's some of (but not all, and not the worst) the issues with the place. The good thing was the bartender (Rob) was very attentive and friendly, so that was a plus.  We didn't eat, but the drinks were not inexpensive. The atmosphere in the bar area was whatever, and for a Saturday night it was pretty dead. 

The worst part of the evening was the valet service. The attendants were very friendly, but the head valet was downright rude. Let me repeat that slowly. Valet. Rude. I don't think I've ever actually encountered that before. It was actually shocking. 

It's a shame, really, the club is  very convenient, but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place!
It's my absolute FAVORITE place to see a show! 
The drinks are reasonably priced, the shows start at a reasonable time (not 10:30pm), and people enjoy the show with their eyes and ears NOT their cell phones. 
Simply awesome!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted this place to be great. It has a lot of potential. We had reservations and got seated right away. The dining room/bar are all smashed into one room, or at least that is where they put us for our reservations. The hostess was kind, waitress Cheyenne (sp?) was super kind. So here is why the 2 stars, the food was pretty tragic. We paid over $10 for a super skimpy portion of Frog Legs. We ordered 3 \"Bourbon Burgers\" cooked medium, all 3 came out Well Done. Thank goodness you get a mini bar bottle of Bulleit Bourbon to help ease the pain of overcooked burger meat. I mean those burgers were dry, and we all ran out of ketchup trying to make them more edible. I really hope the management can get it together because the location is great."}
{"text":"BLK IS AWESOME!! Highly recommend to anyone looking for an exciting night at a venue that has all the right vibes!! Me and my girlfriend went on a whim looking for a fun place to have a date night and blk did not disappoint. The food and drinks were great but were a little pricey so expect to spend some money. We met one of the managers named Jared and he was so kind and more than willing to accommodate us with anything we needed! The staff is great as well! Definitely have to check this place out! We'll for sure be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered from a Very popular food delivery service also a ride service (as to not drop names). And what I got was a wet bag of fries, these poor guys we never crispy. And the sliders we got were posted on a nontoasted non heated plasticish english muffin poor chice in bun to begin with. The meat said to be kobe, was black I mean CHARRED and the other toppings it mentioned, as greens. Well I got the white part of some iceburg lettuce... now if you going to charge $12.00 for just two sliders please put a little effort in it people. I wouldnt feed this swill to my dog. Thank you but NO THANK YOU...!!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place two stars only because it looks nice and has good energy.   Otherwise, what we were served as far as drinks and food, UGHHHH!!!   That's all I have to say about that.   We went for the launch of a magazine.   We were allowed wine and beer to drink at the event.   I don't drink beer so that's out.   The wine was sooooo bad it was undrinkable.   Seriously.   There was no way I could drink that stuff.   The food we were served was some kind of shredded or ground meat inside of a dried up bun.   Yes, got there early so no excuse for the bread being dry.  What look like lettuce wraps were, instead, what looked like would appear on a lettuce wrap but was on a cabbage leaf instead.   UGHHH to both of those items.   We had boiled shrimp, and those got scarfed up since that was basically the only thing we could eat.   There was music later in the evening.   The Instant Classics were performing.   It was karaoke night, but no one was singing so the band played.   I do like this band.  As I mentioned at the beginning, the place does look good but otherwise, I don't think I'd go back unless I learn what we were served is not part of their menu, and that includes the wine."}
{"text":"I went to this venue on Saturday for a live show with local artists. This venue is biggggg. A lot bigger than I thought it would be. The pool area is set up so nicely, too bad it was so cold. Inside is also spacious and comfortable. The food was good, I had mini burgers, the fries were amazing and the ranch had a hint of spice which I LOVED. as well the staff was AMAZING. great service, personable, caring. I really enjoyed my time here and would certainly come back for a meal or a show!"}
{"text":"I was a former production manager for touring national acts years ago. We went to BLK to see some old friends play. I can't tell you enough how impressed I was with the staff. We stopped to eat there before the show and Joel our server was top shelf!! The food was great and the service better. While there we had a problem with the guest list. Jared got it handled for me within 5 minutes without issue. Once inside the venue, Rocco made us feel welcome and issued us the credentials we needed. It was a great night especially when aided by the professional staff. I recommend this venue for both customers who want a fantastic place to both eat great food and see great shows. I also recommend this venue for touring bands both national and local for the way they run an event."}
{"text":"Had a lot of fun here two weekends ago and the bartenders were great. Didn't try the food but I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I jist ordered from your late night menu through uber eats.  My half rack of ribs were inedible.  The meat was completely  dry could not even chew it.  No wonder it was drenched in bbq sauce."}
{"text":"I decided to try the VIP standing only. It was empty all night but I only spent about twenty minutes in there because when I did sit down I was immediately told to stand. You think they would be a little more flexible when it is empty. I have some beers, buy band merch, and usually eat when I see a concert there. I hope people support this venue. My advice is don't get standing only VIP, complete waste of money.

In reply to Rocco: I did know. I'm just advising people to save $20. You are in the right to be strict and enforce nobody sitting but when it's empty and not effecting anybody? It didn't make sense to me. I will be happy to come and see my favorite bands and spend money at BLK Live. I just won't come as often or ever pay for VIP standing only."}
{"text":"Beautiful place reasonable prices great food and friendly service we will go back !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night, what a fantastic venue. The sound system and the band were excellent, and the service was great. They had more than enough bartenders to accommodate the crowd, several different bars throughout the property and they were helpful and quick.

We have seen the Red Not Chili Peppers in other venues in this was a very fun and cool way to experience them. The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was the $5 parking which I'm pretty sure the guy just put in his pocket. Other than that we will definitely be back for another performance."}
{"text":"Dinner was great. We got here at 5:15 for what was supposed to be a 7:45 Neil Diamond cover band. We had dinner. All was great.  Then we moved outside for the show.  We sat at a table (there are only a handful of tables, so we were lucky to get one) and then waited for 20+ minutes for a server to order drinks.  And we waited. And waited. Finally went to bar and opened a tab while servers walked by over and over without stopping at our table (which was one of 8?) one single time. We've now been here for 2 1/2 hours and not one server has touched our table. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Fine - we are getting drinks at the bar while the other tables get served. 2 1/2 hours into our wait and we are informed that the performance starts at 9. Not 7:45 like it said on the ticket.  9:00. The people next to us left when they discovered that fact. 

Poorly organized. Poor service. Poor information. The single bright spot once we moved outside was Jeremy. He was hustling while others stood around.  

Unless there is a really really good act - like Zepplin or Floyd - I probably won't come back. Club music is about to make me nuts. Again - the restaurant and service were fine.  But as a concert venue, it kind of sucks."}
{"text":"Listening to Carlo Fontaine in the lounge this evening. Not bad at all!
Food is excellent and the service is prompt and professional. A great place to meet friends, both old and new.  The place fills up fast with regulars during happy hour, but always room for more!  An eclectic blend of styles of furniture and fixtures gives the place a charm all it's own. Perfect for the hipster cache'."}
{"text":"What a great night!!! Had such a good time, was such a treat! This place is on point!!

Rocco, Lily deserves a raise ;-)

Thank you all for a great night!! Great customer service and yummy beer!"}
{"text":"Have been a few times for live music. Enjoyed it very much. The other night saw Carl Palmer and he was OUTSTANDING! 

They are bringing us some incredible music in an intimate venue and I will continue to support them. They are a huge asset to those of us who enjoy live music ( I am 61). I live close by and hope they continue to WOW me. 
The Wailers and Uriah Heep are next concerts for me."}
{"text":"While a cool lil restaurant and great place for bands to play...stuff is a bit overpriced even for Scottsdale   And the worker with the chin hair and bald head and black T-shirt . Dude you make 12 bucks and hour.  And you totally abuse your power.  Relax. Take it easy.  And don't be a dick to people.  And this place uses way too many straws.  Help the environment.  Use paper straws."}
{"text":"These guys listen. I mean REALLY listen. The improvements have been impressive. It's been a joy to attend shows here. The security, operations, lines, and overall experience is night and day to my original review. From 2 stars to without a doubt best venue and staff in town. Way to go BLK Live!"}
{"text":"BLK Live is awesome!!! I  met friends in Scottsdale and we came here!  The staff...A-a-mazing!!!! The food stellar!!! They brand their burgers!!! I've never seen this!  It's been an awesome time!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  We had a few appetizers and they were all delicious. I'm a picky eater and never eaten frog legs before.  The frog legs are great, very tasty.   The service was great. The waiter was very attentive and made sure our drinks stayed filled. The decor is very welcoming with a little modern and Contemporary mixed.  I highly recommend BLK.  My Co workers and I will definitely be visiting again.  The CHEF came out to meet us.  That was awesome.  Can't wait try the pool."}
{"text":"Omg! Worse service ever! I went to the bathroom and the waitress was rubbing up against my husband when I came out. She quickly stopped her excessive flirting.  We ordered a rose and bud light. My rose came out in a plastic flute that was spotted and dirty. We waited 20 minutes before my husband had to chase the waitress around the bar to get two more drinks. Mind you the place was empty and she had no other customers. She brought his bud light and said I am looking for rose don't worry and again touched him making no eye contact with me. Finally after another 10 minutes of watching her roam around he got up and told her he wanted the check. She told him to sit down. Who talks to customers like this?!? I finally got my drink and we left. I can't imagine returning all though the place looked cool. They need step up the service and train their waitresses to have a little class."}
{"text":"Food delicious, Rachel the bartender is amazing, thanks for awesome drinks and great service, you are the best! London Mule, loving it"}
{"text":"Was VERY excited to try this new venue as I'd passed it a couple of times and researched their website for info. 
Had friends from out of town and was excited to share in a new Scottsdale experience with them and they wanted dinner and dancing and thought this was perfect place.
GREAT decor..very hip and cool. We were seated immediately for our reservation at a high-top table...the chairs were not very comfortable at all (hard metal). 
Our service was very slow...waiting a substantial amount of time for drinks. Waiter was very nice and gracious. We were tempted at one point to go to bar and get our own drinks as we could see bar staff just chit chatting. 
Food was ok...I had the scallops. Can't say they were worth the high cost...they were good, not great. Brussel sprout app was tasty along w/deviled eggs.
The most frustrating part of night was after paying $200(+) for dinner, we went to make our way over to the night club, where we were abruptly stopped and informed it was going to be another $20/person  I'd even called prior and NO one mentioned cover in addition to dinner costs. They need to fix that...if you have dinner discounted, in not complimentary entry to night club. 
I might go back for a drink at the bar, but won't be going back for dinner anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love this place, great staff and atmosphere. Great bands always playing, cant wait to go see another concert!"}
{"text":"The venue itself is a masterwork in design, with a large pool, and a fucking great stage, offering a fantastic presentation of the bands that play there.
But the real gem of the joint is a bartender named Lilly, she doesn't just take care of your drinks, she and her fellow(though, not AS exemplary) bar folk have your fucking back at all times.
If you have the chance, go to BLK Live, and have a night of epic proportions. And be sure to tip well, everyone there earns it, and then some."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a couple months ago and was shocked by the quality of food they service! Everything on the menu was great! 

Since then we have been coming back for drinks and a good time. BLK Live is clean, great atmosphere and good service! 

Management took their time to come by and see how things were and you could tell they were genuinely interested in our experience! 

Love this place and will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"First time here and decided to go check out Plain White Tees concert...AWESOME. Venue is unique with a pool and a couple of bars,  not once did we have to wait more then 30 seconds for a drink. Lilly (our designated bartender) was on top of everything we wanted as soon as we stepped up to the bar. Concert was fantastic with an intimate setting and the staff was more then pleasant...which can be rare in Scottsdale. Will definitely be back and hoping Lilly becomes our \"regular\" bartender."}
{"text":"This venue is so cool!  The food was tasty too!  Service was a little too slow for my liking but, still excited to go back!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit, wanted to get a good feel of it before I passed judgement. I love the casual/chic atmosphere, the 35 & older crowd and its comfortable inside and out. You would be as comfortable in jeans as you would a dress, or a bathing suit during the day! Amazing pool and cabanas!!! The staff is very accommodating and went out of their way to ensure we were having a good time. The food was great, definitely worth the slightly higher prices. Had a b -day party there this weekend and everything went great! I would definitely recommend a visit, for dinner or drinks and dancing"}
{"text":"The worst service I had ever had in my entire life!! The waitress was clueless on what was going on. We get there with a group of 9 on a Tuesday night. What drove us in there was their sign that says they do Taco Tuesday's. When we got there, there was no one there which was super weird. You would think it would be busy but now we know why it's not! 

Like I said waitress was clueless. Brought out the wrong drinks, then warm beer and only provided us with two taco Tuesday menus!!! She kept saying\" idk I'll ask my manager.\" Like figure it out lady! 

It took 50 minutes for our food to be brought out!! Again, there was maybe another table there but it was not busy at all! Oh yea after we sent our beer back because it was WARM, the waitress said to not worry about it, she will comp it.

My husband wanted a few more tacos and the waitress said it would be 5-10 minutes to get them to him. Well 20 minutes pass by and nothing! We got fed up and just ask for our check and she then comes back and tells us that she can't comp our beer for us. What?!? We didn't drink it because it was warm!! We nearly lost our minds. Oh yea and the staff at this place sucks. There was no one around!! Finally my husband speaks with the manager who was dressed like someone that didn't seem like a manager and who was hiding behind the bar the whole time. It was a disaster. Don't go here. I'll be surprised if they are still in business next month honestly."}
{"text":"Best cocktails and best French fries I have ever had! Conner was amazing!! He is so experienced and knows exactly how to make an amazing cocktail! The late night happy hour and the front patio are a must!"}
{"text":"First time here.  This is a neat venue; didn't know it existed until we got Uriah Heep tix. We just had cocktails, which hit the spot.  Seeing that other groups scheduled that we like, I'm sure we'll be back.  Appreciated having Jeremy stop by our table to say hi."}
{"text":"I am not a \"Seasoned Yelper\" and don't try and be a personal critique guru, but this place made me write a review. There is no other place in the greater phoenix area that has compared to how unique and awesome this place is. Still unknown to the area (it has only been open a few months) the place will blow up soon. The classic rock theme, damn good drinks, high quality food and stellar ambiance has this place atop my list of awesome places. 

I had no idea about this place until i made a wrong turn into the Scottsdale Quarters parking structure. They definately need to find a way to get a tower sign on the corner of their lot so people even know its there. I kinda hope it stays quiet for a bit so I can enjoy this place for a bit."}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible Horrible.............stay away..........go to Burger King or McDonalds it will be better food, cheaper and the service will be better!

We went there as a group of 14. We arrived at 6:10 for an 8:00 PM show. We were told we could not have dinner in the \"lounge\" area. Of course our big worry was to get seats to the Rat Pack show we had brought tickets to. Mgt assured us we would be long done with dinner and have great seats in the lounge. ALSO...when we arrived there the place was EMPTY (that should have been our first sign). We promptly ordered a round of drinks and appetizers. Martini's came in plastic glasses.....! The drinks were weak and the appetizers were extremely small. We ordered dinner by 6:30 finally at 7:30 we still had no dinner. Different members of the group had to go to the bar to get a second order for a drink. I went and found a manager that had assured us we would have seating in the lounge even though there was no reserved seating. He once again assured us dinner was on the way and they were holding seats for our group \"since we arrived so early and it was taking soooooo long\". 8:00 PM and still  no dinner. I asked to cancel our orders and we wanted to move into the lounge so we did not miss any of the show we had tickets for. OH.....dinner was on the way. We are once again assured that our seats are being held and the show is running late so no problem.  By 8:20 half of the group have dinner. It is cold, it is small ($17 for a small salad) , several orders are wrong and still several people without a plate in front of them. OK for the end of this saga. Two people NEVER received dinner.  We finally just gave up and asked to be seated in the lounge as the show was starting.  GUESS WHAT...........there were no seats for us!!!!!! 

Management says they are sorry it is a misunderstanding and we hope you will attend another show. YOU have got to be kidding. We drove 45 miles through rush hour traffic, arriving 2 hours early for NO dinner and NO seating for tickets we purchased and management hopes we will attend another show. WOW!

Be aware this is not the classy place you think you are going to. Horrible food, Horrible service, horrible management."}
{"text":"Interesting place ...I went for a concert (KIX) . Opening band was great, a lot of energy. KIX was great but I thought the bass was too high in the mix and the rhythm guitar was almost non existent. I didn't drink but they had a full bar . They have what look like cabanas for seating. 

The stage is in a weird space . About 15 feet from the stage is a pool . I'm surprised no one fell in . I might go back as they have been bringing in 80's/90's rock bands . If the stage was in a different place I'd be more inclined to go back .  I don't know , maybe it's just me but Scottsdale crowds just don't cut it for me . The show was over so early I was able to catch a show at another venue . Visually the place is beautiful- maybe if you're a bit older a are tired of clubs/bars this would be the place for you."}
{"text":"Went to see Morris Day & The Time last weekend. Few things - not enough seating, the restroom toilet was out of order and would have liked to enjoy the restaurant instead of hot dogs and chili. Not everyone can eat that stuff. It was awfully cold outside that night, but the atmosphere was fantastic. The staff was friendly and my small party had a great time. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A great venue! We sat at the inside bar for about an hour prior to the concert. The staff was very friendly and accommodating! The cocktails and food were great! The concert area was very intimate and the stage was clearly visible from everywhere. We stood at the bar and enjoyed the great service and an amazing show. It was a great way to spend a Sunday evening! We will definitely be back and highly recommend that you check it out!"}
{"text":"I blame myself but my brother said let's check BLK out for $10 dollar Monday lobster night.  He thought it would be good and worth checking it out.   First BLK cancel lobster night immediately if not sooner.  The lobster was disgusting and I'm sure frozen before arriving.  Yes I should of known you can't get good lobster for $10 dollars in the desert.  I just wanted to warn anyone before they do the same foolish thing we did.   I'm just waiting for the stomach to start acting up which should be any minute."}
{"text":"My wife and I's first time at BLK live went there for a band that was playing and decided we would eat there as well.  everything was awesome.  Jared the floor manager is great. He can't mix their signature old fashion very good but gave it an excellent shot. Then there's Conner. He is fantastic as a mater mixologist. Everyone working there was great. Connor makes one of the best old fashions I've had and again the food -awesome- thumbs up to the crew at BLK live."}
{"text":"What great find! The perfect place to have a bite to eat, cool off, and enjoy live music!  The burgers and fries are fantastic, the kids loved the pool, and the cabanas with misters were awesome!"}
{"text":"Interesting bar. Only 7 people at the bar, the bar tender busy chatting to his friends/regulars took over 8 minutes to be served a drink, hate to be here on a busy night. One lady at the bar holding her dog, so no health issues here. I suppose to get served quicker to have to be family or friends with the bar tender. I didn't have time to bond so finished my drink and moved on, who knows when I could have got the next one. Perhaps there should be a phone in option?"}
{"text":"Hands down had the best experience and time at this place. Awesome venue and even better staff. The place is huge and the layout is very cool....I need to bring my bathing sure next time. Never a dull moment. The staff was extremely courteous and always making sure we were taken care of. Huge shout out to Jeremy for being so attentive with me (even if I accidentally hit the cancel button ha) and for making sure we were having fun...which we did! I can't wait to come back here. Also our waitress (sorry I can't remember her name) was on it with our drinks and just had a great personality and loved talking to her. I usually don't write reviews but I had to write one for this venue and the staff. Simply Awesome! Thank you BLK Live."}
{"text":"Apart from our waitress, who tried very hard to keep up in such a hectic atmosphere (there was a concert) I was thoroughly unimpressed. We arrived early to get a good seat. I ordered a beer on tap at the bar and had to point it out to the bartender so he knew what it was. We ordered 2 appetizers off the menu and proceeded to wait over an hour to get them. Our server was very apologetic each time, which was kind, but these are appetizers that should be very easy to \"fire\" from the kitchen. One of them, the Kobe meatballs was so bland it was nearly inedible. Which was extremely disappointing after waiting an hour. Again, our server was beyond kind and actually had the food comped, which was a good gesture based on the experience. I'd go again maybe if it is slower, or they are better prepared for a crowd, but I won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"sarah is the best server and blk is the best everyone should come here if your looking for a good time!!!"}
{"text":"Super cool place to chill with seating surrounding the pool. Simply beautiful atmosphere....and the drinks aren't bad either."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here two times for two different shows and we have eaten dinner here both times. The first time dinner was great. The second time, the burgers were overcooked and the fries were undercooked. The manager took one of the burgers off of our bill and gave us a gift card to come back which was nice. The area where they have the shows has a pool right in the middle, for shows where the pool is not in use, they really need to have a cover so it gives more standing room. Also they seem to have sound issues with the headliners if you're standing upfront. Both times Color of Chaos opened and you could clearly hear the lead singer however when the headliners came out, unless the singer was basically eating the microphone you could not hear him over the rest of the music. I don't know if this is an equipment issue or what. For this reason I give it two stars."}
{"text":"Just went to BLK Live for my first time. We caught the Sunday brunch. Let me say...the food was amazing. I strongly recommend the breakfast burger. In addition to great beef, the bacon and bun were the best I've had. I also suggest the hash browns. The method of preparation at BLKK Live and presentation of an old breakfast \"standard\" hash-brown is to be experienced ;)

Daniel was our server and was a wealth of information about not only the menu but the events, ambiance, and general club/restaurant info.

I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Went there for drinks/dinner at the bar in the first week that this very interesting addition to North Scottsdale entertainment choices was open. Marissa did a great job of serving us well-priced drinks and burgers - a good Ahi burger for me at $16 and regular burger for my wife at $12. Marissa took the time to show us around the property, which has a lovely pool, outside bar with palapa roof, and lounge chairs.  Should definitely be \"the scene\" once fully finished. BLK is an established brand in Huntington Beach, CA, and it seems that the management knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"My husband liked his food okay (I was meeting him there, and had already eaten). But the sound quality at the concert was horrible! We started out sitting close to the front, but the distortion and loudness of the speakers made it impossible to enjoy the music. We moved to the back, behind the pool. Better, but not great. I'm not picky about sound quality, but even I could tell it was poor. Hopefully that was a one-time occurrence, because it was a real disservice to the amazing performers. Also, it seems weird that the pool takes up what would normally be prime seating area."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon BLK Live for lunch with some friends and found a gem! Not only was the ambiance fun and filled with personality, the food was SO GOOD! The bartender made killer drinks and the vibe was great. The brussel sprouts and burgers were insanely good. We cannot wait to come back for a meal or for a few drinks by the pool!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, not does it only have a pool but it has a restaurant with 5star dining. I came in with my family for a special occasion and we were very pleased how everything turned out. Not only from the service perspective but the food as well. 2 thumbs up forsure. The staff was dressed very profesional all around. Its rare to find a place that has their managers walk around and touch up on the tables. Rocco and Cookie were great and have this place on point. Chef Daniel came out and we met him as well, he was wonderful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a very clever setup. It's part restaurant part nightclub with a swimming pool and stage outside.  Amazing sound system and decor complete with waterfall and high-end, modern decor.  The only thing that I really did not like was we tried to order food on more than one occasion at least four times, and were actually seated and we were told that the kitchen was closed for one hour due to backlog. Nobody ever came back after that to take our order after 10 minutes nor  half an hour not 40 minutes to even get the order started.  This facility is losing business with that kind of lax service.  If you're not ready to serve the masses on a Friday night, what are you ready for BLK?  That's when your employees should be raking in your most cash flow for the whole week?  I rate three stars for the ambience, the sound system, and the drinks were decent although very heavy on the ice. Zero stars for food service courteousness and attentiveness of food service staff was sorely lacking."}
{"text":"If you're looking to see washed up 80s bands that play WAY too loud for the space, you've found your spot. BLK Live is a dive pretending to be a high class spot without the charm of either. Mediocre food and so so service round out the offerings. With so many great places to go in the Valley, why anyone shows up at this \"jack of all trades master of none\" place is beyond me."}
{"text":"So I was famished after shopping and recognized the sign for BLK Live which I had recently heard about, so I wanted to check it out.  The location is just in a perfect central location, no wonder this place had quite a gathering on a warm Saturday afternoon.  The music coming from the pool area was somewhat of a surprise when I got out of the car because I had no idea that BLK Live had a huge pool and bar and basically was like being at a pool club on the Las Vegas strip.  I wasn't in the mood for a party so I was delightfully pleased that I couldn't hear the party from the nicely decorated industrial chic restaurant inside. 

Ok, the food. Wow. I started by ordering the crispy Brussel sprouts and could not of been more impressed.  One bite and I knew what \"RIGHT\" should taste like. It will be hard to every meet the same Brussel sprout experience.  Next I ordered one of the signature burgers, the El Jimador.  Again I was thoroughly impressed by the presentation and floored by the taste.  My only regret was that I couldn't order another signature burger to be amazed again but I was absolutely full and satisfied in every way.  

The staff at BLK Live was awesome. The server was very attentive and knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu.  I usually will never order the same entrée at a restaurant but I don't think I could pass on the crispy brussels next time I come back.  The overall experience exceeded my high expectations.  

Whether you are looking for a great time out by the pool or a quieter drink/meal inside, this is the place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Potential is what BLK has. Hopefully it will be around long enough to show some since the Airpark Office area isn't necessarily teeming with fun places to eat/drink and it's not been open terribly long. 

I've been here a few times in a few days and was crazy to see night n' day difference between different dining times [happy hour and lunchtime]. Our first time it was a fairly quiet happy hour, a few tables were already occupied. Our group was led to our table and not left with any menu. This place has no drink menu except for a wine list. Come on bro! If you're gonna focus 1/3 on music, 1/3 on food, 1/3 on drinks then there needs to be something to show onto that has all of your alcohols. Maybe feature a few specialty house/bartender drinks? Our server also wasn't terribly knowledgable about the fairly disappointing beer selection, but she was nice and quickly got our drinks out.

I've also dined here during lunch- avoid it at all costs during that time! My group and I were there for 90 minutes during our work day(!!), most of it spent waiting for food and checks. Not sure where a restaurant thinks that is an acceptable amount of time when we have to return to the office. Frustrating too is that it's not like BLK was really packed during lunch, and our server was a ghost most of the time. Just kind of a hot mess express topped by an expensive, disappointing meal by everyone I was with. The food all-in-all sounds good, but it wasn't that special. I ordered the BLK Gorgonzola Salad and was excited to try some of their steak. What I got was a small plate of spinach, random bits of red onion and cheese, and not even a fistful serving of steak. All for $17, presented on a small appetizer plate. Suggestion- salads should be in bowls, and maybe have more substance to them. 

I'm totally in love with the ambiance/design aesthetic, a chill pool and cool lounge area. However, the awesome external features cannot hide the underlying issues that we faced."}
{"text":"Great music venue. My wife and I were there this weekend for Dierde and Warrant concert. The concert was outside and the weather was great.  Drink prices were high but there is a Scottsdale rent to pay which makes perfect sense. The only thing that was not up to par was the soundman for the show. The sound was terrible by the stage and off to the side of the stage. It only sounded great in the back of the pool area. I will go back but will definitely get to the rear of the venue."}
{"text":"I went here to see a concert for my birthday and had a blast! Nice place, Great service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Literally sat at the bar with no service. Bartender saw us as well as the manager and just looked at us. No hello, welcome, how are you. Just looked at us and completely ignored the fact we were there."}
{"text":"Blk Live, Keep it. Taking tickets at the door can't be that tricky for a venue that has concert events, BUT apparently it is. Open the doors at 7 o'clock, what would be the difference if you opened the doors earlier? That ticket line was completely unacceptable. 
Amateur's run this place. How many ways can you apologize for running the place so poorly?   The bar ran out of ginger beer. The computer's were down, not enough bartenders. You can only wait so long to spend your money."}
{"text":"Fabulous place! Highly recommended. Great ambience! Would attend another concert again!"}
{"text":"Where do I start.   Amazing staff.  Bartenders are amazing and the food was to die for.  This spot is new and I can't wait for the word to get out because these guys deserve success.  I'll be back whenever I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I don't get this place at all but wanted to try it. My girlfriend and I were hoping to find a neighborhood bar to just hangout at on a regular basis. This isn't it.  I don't get it at all. Why would people come way up to the Kierland/Scottsdale Quarter area for an old town type bar. Drinks are average price but way overdone. Mule was overpowered with ginger and my girlfriends drink was overpowered with lemon. Swing and a miss."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Amazing service and such a fun environment! The manager, Jared, was so accommodating and kind. A hidden gem for sure!!"}
{"text":"I traveled a long way to come to BLK Live. Right as I walk in I loved the place. Great atmosphere and ambience. I ordered two apps the Poke and Street Corn. Both were amazing the tuna was very fresh. Then I had the Ribs and the Sailor Jerry sauce was a great touch. They fell right off the bone like they should. Then I ordered a Mule was was done right. Moved out to the poolside to have dessert. I ordered the Cronut and it did not disappoint! Pretty great to have an anemone dinner then enjoy live entertainment poolside while I drink and have the amazing Cronut."}
{"text":"We had dinner here Aug. 6.  The dinner menu is relatively limited and expensive for what is offered, as an example - $19 for a basic hamburger and fries (don't care if its supposed to be wagyu beef for the hamburger).  The Happy Hour menu looked more inviting, but was not available when we dined. We had the wagyu beef meatballs appetizer, candidly no different from any other meatball, the fries were typical and mediocre, and our Caesar salads were truly very ordinary.  Our server was okay, professing to be his first night, so will give him grace.   Its cool that they bring in live music so that is the upside, just wouldn't eat here."}
{"text":"Ughhhh why?  Seriously, why is this \"club\" a music venue? Saw She wants revenge there last night and it was tragic they decided on BLK was the venue of choice. Who was the genius who decided a pool should be smack dab in the middle of where the audience stand? The bathrooms are too small for the amount of people they pack in there. It was beyond freezing and they had no heat lamps out for the general admission people. Only for the whole 3 VIP people. Had I known what this place was like I would of skipped the show all together. 2 stars is me being nice because the front door/security guy and make bartender at the main bar were really nice. Odds are this place will be closed or something else in a year"}
{"text":"Last night was by far one of the absolute worst service/dining experiences I have had at a restaurant... 

I should have seen the forewarning when we walked in and there was only about 5 people in this place. Went in on a \"Taco Tuesday\" around 7 PM and the only had a total of two, yes two, taco menus for my party of 9. Our waitress was clueless, didn't know the menu, didn't know the drinks, she would have to go ask every question which resulted in a about a 10 minute wait every time we asked her something. She's new? That's fine, I understand, get help, but the management just let her struggle and lose customers for good. 

We order our beers, 3 Negro Modelos and 1 Modelo Especial. She brings 4 cans of Modelo Especial, no biggie, we politely tell her we didn't order that and she comes back with 3 draft Negro Modelos. These beers were about 50 - 60°F and gross. We tell her about it, she has to go ask the manager or bartender; whomever. Comes back and says that there is nothing she can do about it. So we don't drink them and they just sit at our table. Just wait for the end, these beers are where I lose it... 

By this time we have all shared the two taco menus and decided what we wanted; TACOS! Because your business advertises Taco Tuesday, remember? I can see the complete panic and confusion in our waitress' eyes when she was about to take the order, so I ask if she would like to leave a piece paper and a pen we will write our order down for her. We did, and it seemed simple enough. Everyone wrote there name and what they wanted, easy right? She comes back about 10 minutes later and gets the paper with our order and takes it to the kitchen. So from the time we sat down, it has taken almost an hour to get our food. We're hungry, frustrated and not being taken care of, not to mention I have kids screaming because they want to eat. But every employee there from the guys in blue shirts to the manager to the waitress made us seem we were a very large inconvenience. Jump forward - 

Tacos come out, and sad to say, they were really good. I would have loved to like this place so I could go back. They were good, the shrimp ones in particular. They are small but what do you expect from a Scottsdale restaurant for $2? I asked our waitress how long it would take to get 3 more shrimp tacos out, she had to go ask, came back and said 5-6 minutes. Perfect! I'll take 3. After I order the last tacos, she asks if we want anything more, we just ask for the check and mentions that shes going to ask her manager to take the beers off the tab. Thanks for remembering, appreciate that. She comes back in another 10 minutes, no tacos, and says that the beers can't be taken off the tab. WTF? We didn't even drink them. They were gross, and we told you right away.... I am in awe of this place at this point, this has really set me off. I ask to speak with her manager and she runs back to kitchen, I guess to look for him? 

We are sitting at our table, waiting to talk to someone who knows WTF they are doing and waiting pay and to leave and waiting and she's not back. I finally ask a guy at the register whose dressed in like a t-shirt and shorts where the manager is. Guess what? He's the manager! Where's Waldo!?!?! At this point I was mad and maybe a little rude so I give him the low and dirty of this crap-show, he says just go and he'll comp the meal. 

Truth be told, I hate doing this. I hate getting upset over a freaking meal and writing bad reviews. I would have loved to have great service and pay a $150 bill and given a great waitress and nice tip; that's what I would have liked to do. But BLK Live made this impossible... it was just bad, downright bad. Not too sure how much longer you'll be in business with this model, but next time I will make sure to go to a restaurant and not a club first, restaurant second. 

Freaking ruined GD Taco Tuesday, thanks!"}
{"text":"Interesting spot in North Scottsdale have not been here since it was El Santo a few years ago. They pretty much kept it the same but definitely improve the pool area. They put in individual large Cabanas that give it a nice island feel. They always have live music a good crowd friendly attentive wait staff and an overall good vibe. We'll be coming back and check it out other nights."}
{"text":"This place was amazing from the staff to the food! It has a great atmosphere making want to come for brunch and dinner! A group of us came during happy hour, which they have everyday, and ordered many appetizers to share and everything was delicious ! Definitely recommend and will come back"}
{"text":"Came to BLK Live with a girlfriend last weekend and REALLY enjoyed it. 

This place is dope! From a décor perspective, the restaurant section was very stylish and modern and the color palette is very appealing to the eye. They have awesome, vivid photos of iconic musicians all around too, which lent a certain coolness to the vibe.

I also appreciated that the lighting wasn't as dim/pitch black as a lot of the trendier places in the Valley. How refreshing to actually be able to read my menu!

We visited at around 8:30 on Saturday night and I have to say, the place was pretty bare. The hostess mentioned that they just had a grand opening last month so we definitely got the vibe that this place is \"up and coming\", and not necessarily established (popular) yet. I was ok with that. We got very personalized, kind service from Rob and Daniel as a result and our food was served super fast!

We split a very smooth, crisp tasting bottle of Moscato and each ordered seafood. I had the coconut shrimp and broccolini (both on the appetizer and sides menu) and my friend had the salmon with couscous.

The shrimp was served in a delightful bath of cocktail sauce in a cuuute little coconut shell and it was SO GOOD. I loved that the coconut wasn't overpowering the taste of the shrimp. 

However, I must say, when I saw that the price for the shrimp appetizer was $13, I did a MAJOR eyeroll. No way in hell should five shrimp cost this much and yeah, even though it was delicious and I LOVED every bite, it is exorbitantly overpriced. 

*You can get double this amount of yumtastic shrimp at high-end/fancy Steak 44 for $12...sooo BLK may want to revisit what they're charging for this appetizer.*

The broccolini at BLK was also very impressive. Seasoned well and al dente! Some of the tastiest I've ever had.

My girlfriend loved her salmon dish but unfortunately we didn't save room for dessert (which was also overpriced sadly- $10 for a cronut dish??).

BLK has awesome food and they play fantastic CURRENT music (Pop, R&B, Hip-hop) with a mix of older hits as well, so there's something for everyone. They have a fairly good sized \"nightclub/dance floor\" area  and a pool and cabanas outside. I didn't visit the restroom but my girlfriend mentioned they had showers and a place to change for folks taking advantage of the pool. 

I think with proper marketing, this place could easily be a hit. The high food pricing aside, it's in a great location convenient to Kierland and The Quarter, with it's own large parking lot, it's gorgeous inside, they have the draw of a pool for summer day or night parties, good music, and the food is amazing. There isn't a lot of \"nightlife\" in this area either since so much of that is focused in Old Town. Hopefully BLK will be around a while- I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had a scrumptious lunch here today. Cheyenne showed us to our table and we were served within minutes. Service was prompt and attentive. They have a lunch menu, a dinner menu and a nice wine list. We started with the appetizer mac and cheese and the coconut shrimp.  The shrimp is deliciously battered and then served in a coconut.  I could have eaten this all day long. We shared the classic burger and it was divine.  It came with a side of thickly cut fries.  I can not refuse onion rings, so we shared those too.  Heavenly! I will be back for more.  They have entertainment on the weekends and you can book events inside or by the pool. Great location."}
{"text":"So after reopening I have been here a few times. Food is fair price. Very  delicious and presented nicely and properly . The venue is gorgeous and the bathrooms (mens) fairly maintained but each time  however by 11 PM no towels. No for some constructive criticism that greatly improve this place. Great venue except, price is high on domestic beer.. 7.50 for a can of beer (Kilt lifter) and its a can, asked for a cup and here ya go. Thanks for pouring it. Average wait time is 10 minutes for a drink ..always, even when only 50 people in the place. They are not the best at mixing a cocktail outside / inside yes but that closes like at 9:00. The place just is not good at hospitality - like cleaning up, empty glasses, dirty dishes on most any table that are not wiped down. Employees behind the bar spraying each other with the water from the soda gun. Management tends to leave the chase chairs up front by the stage  in the way of where people want to dance,  moving them to the back would open up dance area. Also When it was Santo's there was a huge clear 10 Gallon water jug with cucumber for people as its hot. Bring it back. This takes people away from the bar and doesnt over burden the staff serving water. No one walks around taking drink orders . Cabana service is poor too. like ..why have them if no one services them? Connect both bars with WIFI so only need one tab and why do I need to know which bartender I bought from. they are not personable so I dont know...? very odd practice. These are some very simple adjustments to management style and best practices that will meet a guests common expectations . This  could change the impact the longevity of this incarnation in a positive manner. Keep at it this way and it will shutter again. I like this place, however -more detail to managed hospitality- BE THE GUEST -  make me want to tip you.. A LOT. Don't make me think meh its ok. Make me think I am dropping  $150 I want to come back. There are a many many more places in Scottsdale and they make sure if there is an issue it doesn't happen again. good luck , hope to repost positive change.. :)"}
