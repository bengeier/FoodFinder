{"text":"Supervisor was very inconsiderate!!!! Treating his employees like trash and ignoring them anytime they needed help with something or were disturbing what he was doing. One employee was trying to get help voiding an item for a customer and not once did he go help. Employee tried getting his attention multiple times and he just kept ignoring her. Supervisor went to the kitchen and never came back. Would really consider replacing this supervisor with someone more helpful."}
{"text":"Totally disorganized. Food is edible but if you get unlucky they forget your order. They could run this place with two good employees but instead, 5 employees and 2 managers walk around paying little attention to customer's needs. Just get something to eat at Starbucks."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!. you'll need a second mortgage. 2 toasted sandwiches. a bag of chips and 2 drinks. $33, and they don't even have a tray for me to carry it on. Clear your own table before you sit down!!!! I don't care that the high price is caused by the 'cost of their rent'. Absolute extortion. Avoid at all costs. Staff didn't really care either. In fact, when I complained about the costs she said, 'yeah, I get that everyday'!"}
{"text":"I order the salmon wrap, as a vegetarian I was not expecting to find a large piece of bacon in it! I'm really DISGUSTED! This is outrageous that the label of this item says: Salmon wrap when it actually contains porc! The service is also very poor, you don't know where to go to pay and the lady doesn't even indicate you to go to the cashier once you order.
I'm extremely frustrated right now as I took out my order and I'm now seating on a 5h flight with no food! You guys really suck!"}
{"text":"I was trying to find a healthier option in this wing of the airport and in doing so, spent $10 on the worst wrap I've ever had. Barely warm tortilla with a nearly freezing internal temperature. On top of that, it was eight dollars for a Negra Modelo. 

This takes airport food to a new low for me and I fly often. I almost wish I would have gone for one of the alternatives - Burger King or Carl's Jr..."}
{"text":"For airport food this was really good. Lots of choices from sandwiches & wraps to salads and desserts. Pretty reasonable prices. A healthier option to burgers and fries.  Service was awesome very sweet and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Meh. And the sun-dried tomato tastes like leather. Apparently Yelp feels that this review is too short."}
{"text":"The fruit and feta salad was delicious. The taste was obviously a major factor, but what really hit me was the smell. All the ingredients were fresh and you could tell just by the aroma (minus the feta which doesn't inherently smell all that great)."}
{"text":"Located in gate E, terminal 3. La Tapenade is a decently healthy choice. However, the salads and sandwiches are prepackaged (in addition to a few Asian noodle bowls, lol random). I ordered the Greek salad the price is steep at $11 but it's fresh and guilt-free. The lady at the counter looked at me a little funny when I asked if they have hummus since medditerian food usually equals hummus. They do not, which is a bit of a bummer. The sandwiches don't look particularly appetizing,  but I wasn't able to try for myself."}
{"text":"The tables are disgusting.  Nobody cleans them even though it is still early in the day.  For $10 I got two pieces of day old bread, a slice of cheese, a slice of tomato, and basil.  The workers don't speak English so it is very difficult to order.  Everything is overpriced.  They don't deserve to call themselves a restaurant when they take advantage of tourists who don't know any better."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I paid $13 for a 'cuban' sandwich. They literally put sliced fat instead of pork roast in my sandwich with a slice of ham (thus allowing me three edible bites of sandwich). Fortunately the bread was delicious and fresh. Sadly I have to board and can't go to complain."}
{"text":"The food was lousy.  The cheese pizza was greasy and bland.  It reminded me of pizza at the cafeteria when I was in college.  The lime chicken sandwich that my wife ordered was also less than stellar.  The service was slow, and they already had run out of several sandwiches on the menu, even though we ordered around 1pm."}
{"text":"Tomato caprese sandwich was actually good for airport food.

Service was terrible and slow."}
{"text":"I have never had better customer service in my life. I did not have any money because I lost my wallet and this place gave me food and a drink and fully took care of me. Tanesha was the nicest person and I can not thank her enough for her kindness. Thank you so much and anytime I come to Las Vegas in the future I will be sure to stop here. I appreciate you!"}
{"text":"Was looking for something a little more healthy than Carl's Jr or Burger King and didn't feel like spending an arm and a leg for the other restaurants in the airport so I decided to eat here. 

Food was good and they have a nice selection. I went with one of their grilled mozz and chicken sandwich and it wasn't too bad. 

I agree with the other reviewer that service is on the slow side and they didn't seem to know who was first in line since they helped someone who cut in front of me and even watched him do it LOL. 

All in all I had a good and healthier-side sandwich so it worked out. 

A-OK pretty much sums it up here."}
{"text":"Prepackaged salad from two days ago and refrigerated. Flatbread looks great on the menu, awful in reality."}
{"text":"This is a great option for those flying from Terminal 3 or departing on United or Hawaiian Airlines who check in at Terminal 3 and ride the tram to D. La Tapenade is located right next to Carls Jr by gate E3. 

La Tapenade has everything from salads, wraps, panini's, flat breads and gourmet desserts. The two employees working were very friendly and helpful. I chose the caprese sandwich which came with a small side of bow tie pasta. The bread was super fresh as was the slices of buffalo mozzarella. There was only one small slice of tomato on each side however. 

If your looking for something somewhat healthy or even a custard tart or chocolate mousse while in terminal 3 this is the place. Prices are average for the airport."}
