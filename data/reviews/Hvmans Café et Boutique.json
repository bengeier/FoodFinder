{"text":"Hot chocolate is delicious. Actually tastes like chocolate and they do latte art. I had a panda face the other day! Made my morning!!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and amazing pastry with vegan options available. The opening hours are awesome and the place is pretty spacious to study/meet up with friends, etc..."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS CALLED HVMANS. NOT HVMAS.  I just visited this cafe for the first time today after a long time of wanting to go here, my expectations were exceeded! I loved the interior and atmosphere of the cafe. There were quite a few drinks on the menu and so much selection on baked goodies. I decided to get an iced americano and chocolate chip cookie. It was $3 for the coffee and $2.50. They have three types of blends for their espresso so choose wisely! I got a medium dark roast and it really hit the spot! I'm planning to come back since their blends are a mix of Phil and Sebastian beans with this other brand that I like but do not know the name of (it's a black bag of beans with gold font). The chocolate chip cookie was so good. It was your standard chocolate chip cookie but it had this type of syrup/honey/ something sticky that was hardened once it was baked. It was so delicious and tasted great with the coffee. Most, if not all of their pastries are provided from Sophie Sucree but I don't know if threy got those chocolate chip cookies from sophie sucree since I have had their chocolate chip cookies and they are not as fat and chewy as the one I ate today. I will be returning soon and will try their pistachio biscotti that looked delicious. The only downside is that some of their baked goods are a bit overpriced for what it is. The biscotti is $3.50?!!? Coffee drink pricing was pretty standard.  Fun fact: Since this cafe is also a boutique they sell bags of beans and cactus! The cacti range from $10- $15.  Once again I recommend coming here with a friend since the cafe is very open and your laptop is at risk of being stolen if you leave it unattended when you go to the washroom."}
{"text":"Cute small shop serving De Mello beans. Ample seating and plugs, nice light in the cafe for studying. My espresso was decently pulled. They offer pastries and kombucha as well. They just opened so I don't want to be too critical, but it seems like they're still finishing up some minor cosmetic things like painting here and there so the cafe decor has a bit of a mash up feel between old and new. Overall a nice alternative for when Myriad is packed!"}
{"text":"Very cute place and really convenient for Concordia students considering is a block away from the Montreal campus. It's a little small though and kinda chilly. Good assortment of pastries. I work a block away so i would only go there for a change of scenery!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience at Hvmans Cafe (but I didn't get any food or pastries there so I won't be talking about that)!  I love the interior design and decor of this place, it's so clean, white, and bright. It's really comfortable too, you would see many Concordia students doing their work or groups of friends enjoying a cup of coffee and chatting.   The cashier was super sweet, as well as the rest of the employees who gave a really welcoming and chill vibe to the place. I decided to get a soy latte, though there was quite the selection of drinks.  I would recommend this cafe to students and people who like cute interior decors and a clean space to do work/hang with friends."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  It's a super cute and comfortable cafe. They have some interesting pastries, a good selection of drinks, good lighting, free wifi, clean, and it's not too hard to find a seat,  I ordered the spinach quiche and spinach pastry. Both were ok. Nothing special, and kinda cold (even though I asked for them to be heated). A bit pricey honestly (4$ and 5$).  I also got a hot chocolate and it was ok as well. I could taste the powder they mixed in as well as the chocolate sprinkles so that's why it was only ok. But all prices include tax, so there's that.   The wifi, albeit free, is really slow/glitchy. I couldn't watch my video tutorials without it giving up on me a couple of times.  The tables are also tiny, which is great if you only need to work on your laptop but I usually sprawl all my stuff on the table and get to work. So it was really inconvenient to be restricted to a circular table.   Overall, it's really not a bad place. It's great for writing essays, reading, or having a chat with a friend. It just didn't suit all my personal student needs."}
{"text":"Small, hip café near Guy Concordia. A lot of white, clean decor. There was one (very pretty) woman working the cash and counter but she worked really enthusiastically and efficiently. Menu includes taxes! I ordered the matcha latté for $5 and I liked it a lot. The pastries looked reallllly good, I'll try them next time!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while looking for somewhere to shelter from the rain. Glad I did! The staff were friendly and I had a nice hot chocolate and cookie. The atmosphere was relaxed and relatively quiet. I'd go here again."}
{"text":"This is my fav place to work and have a nice cup of latte during the week. The barista are personable and kind and make great coffee every single time. The pastry collection is adequate: the blondies are nice, the chocolate chip cookies are a bit too sweet and they have gluten free brownies. But what the place may lack in pastries, it makes up for in atmosphere:  they are located at the corner of mackay and st catherine and are one  the brighest coffee places in downtown with glass windows from floor to ceiling all around. They dont charge extra for almond/soy milk and sometimes have nice  little homemade middle eastern sweets that shouldn't be missed."}
{"text":"Brand new cafe on St Catherine's. Awesome selection of cafe and pastries! Jerry the owner does amazing latte art and has a great passion for his work.  It is the third day of opening so signs are still being worked on but I recommend everyone to try it out. One of the best lattes I've had in Montreal and pastries selection is wonderful.   Right across from Concordia. Good quiet atmosphere to study and read a book as well!"}
{"text":"Cute cosy spot in the middle of downtown. My americano was ok. The menu however seems to include many corky options like naan calzone & all kind of cute pastries, so I would say its worth stopping by."}
{"text":"This was a really nice aesthetic cafe on st. Catherine street.   I really like the vibe of this place perfect to get some work done on a weekday night or chilling in the weekend.   The baristas were friendly and welcoming.   They have a good selection of gelato here too which I am excited to try next time. I care in to try a croissant, but couldn't resist the blueberry donut as well.   The croissant was light and buttery - not too flaky though. I have had better croissants elsewhere but they were still good here!   The blueberry donut though, that was amazing!!! Oh my goodness it was so fresh and tasty. And so light and refreshing. The icing was unbelievably good.   The ambience is great too, relatively peaceful and a pleasant view of st. Catherine street.   In all a really solid cafe. I need to try their matcha latte next time!"}
{"text":"A new café located in downtown, close to Concordia, replacing the old Yeh frozen yogurt shop. It is one of the brightest cafes I have been, the interior is mostly in white and simplistic: quite chic actually! They have several unique choices for drinks but I decided to go with a green tea latte. They also have a partnership with Bilboquet, a great ice cream brand. They offer Bilboquet ice cream inside their cafe and it is really a great treat in summer!"}
{"text":"Adorable new cafe with great lighting and good wifi! Definitely a go-to for students to study!   The coffee was good but some of the drinks seem to be a bit on the pricier side. In terms of food--they only offer baked goods at the moment. I took the almond/chocolate croissant and it was decent but not the best I've had, although I heard great things about their brownies! (Edit: just tried their brownies--they are AMAZING--please get them) Overall, I think the aesthetic of the cafe is very cute (you can even buy some of their plants) and it's a great place to just chill and study."}
