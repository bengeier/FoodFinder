{"text":"Sandy is one of the owners while her husband is the cook, awesome!!!!  Parking is limited but so worth it. I went there because my neighbor referred us. He's been going there with friends for awhile now. We took a chance and WOW!!! Lots of food for the price. They just now raised there prices after several years but by only a $1-$2 maximum that I have seen. He doesn't mind adding additional items to the food anytime, small fee. Homefries excellent and he'll add peppers and onions no problem. JUST ASK! Small place but friendly and relaxed. You do get served fast. Emily is a waitress and she is fun to deal with. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"I took a risk suggesting this for a morning breakfast outing with my family.  I knew the building it was in (used to sell good/cheap Fish sandwiches on Fridays during Lent), and so I knew it wasn't going to be a high class affair.

There is minimal parking there, a few spots up front, more on the side (side road towards S Park Rd)

There is some food storage right in the restaurant, to the left of the tables -- on the wall joining the bar and restaurant areas.

There are approximately 8-10 tables, with seating for probably 35.

This CASH ONLY place (ATM in the bar, $2.00 surcharge) only got better after we sat down.

The service was fast, friendly, and attentive.

The food was reasonably priced, generous in quantity, and the coffee strong.  The pancakes were light, fluffy, and huge. Blueberry pancakes were a hit with my kids, the breakfast burrito was tasty, and all around a solid breakfast place.

I have zero complaints about the food, and if you can get past the ambiance (and the older clientele!), you're not likely to have a bad, reasonably priced meal!

I might point out that for FAMILIES, this might be a great diamond in the rough.  The staff, low-key atmosphere, and small size seem to keep my kids at bay."}
{"text":"What a joke of a *grille*. We went here to eat dinner and we waited & waited for someone to even acknowledge we were there. First of all they had the dining room door locked so my family consisting of a 16,13& 7yr old had to walk through the smelly smoky bar. We literally waited 10-15 mins and still nobody came to our table BUT some guy gave us the remote to change the tv channel. Obviously at that point we gave up and walked out."}
{"text":"Our first visit and don't let the wear and tear intimidate you.  We had a terrific breakfast, steak & eggs, breakfast burrito and the traditional eggs over easy.  On weekends you get a bonus egg so enjoy!  The bar is off limits to children and the under 18 set, but the dining room is smoke free and plenty of room.  We'd like to come back for dinner and we'll certainly be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Yikes!!!! This place is a turd in a hole in the wall. The word dive didn't do this pace justice. If they keep the dining room this disgusting how does the kitchen look??? Couldn't even bring myself to buy the food from a menu stapled to the dirty wall. The coffee wasn't, it just wasn't. What a waste of time. The servers were very polite and seemingly not surprised when we paid and left without eating or drinking anything.Oh yeah and there's a bar stocked with drug addled looking degenerates. Wish I could give less than one star. Have a nice day!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is killer! Nice hole in the wall bar to get a drink. It is a smoking bar. If you don't like smoking then this isn't for you. And then come on here and bitch about the smoking."}
{"text":"This place is the eye sore of Bethel Park. I live in the neighborhood behind this bar.  I used to live in really awful neighborhood in Brentwood for years and I've seen more disturbances coming from this bar. I stoped there for a drink there a handful of times. They made me feel completely unwelcome because I wasn't one of the local frequent drunks...I'm a really tolerant person and I really hope this place shapes up."}
{"text":"My friend likes to visit little places like this, so we figured we would give it a try.  It's definitely a bar when you walk in, but they have a side room for food.

It was really fun, because who typically goes to a bar for breakfast?  It was great.  I had the chocolate chip pancakes and home fries which were awesome.  

The only downfall, was that we were the only girls out of a ton of regular guys. Ladies, go! Their pancakes are great! 

Our waitress was very laid back but also very attentive.  She made sure we were always good to go.  

Very happy with this little find."}
