{"text":"Monday 12:30 PM was slow so I should have known. Ate on the roof top patio.  SLOW service!  Dirty tea glass! Food took forever! Spring rolls were greasy but was to hungry to send them back since they took so long to get. Had to look at an unbussed table full of gnawed on chicken wings for my whole meal.. It was my only view since the walls are to hight to see over. Asked for a sweet tea to go ; no lid!! Hubby tried to sign the check but the pen didn't work. Kind of a funny way to end the horrible meal.  Never going back.  But we will go back to Monfort location!  So much better in so many ways!"}
{"text":"Run from this place unless you are ok with waiting an hour for a salad.  My wife and I went there to see if it would be decent enough to bring friends to and they earned a NO.  While it's ok to wait 5 minutes to be recognized as a customer in waiting, from the time we ordered and we called it a night was 45 minutes (timed).  When we asked for the check, they said the food was coming up now........tick-tick-tick, 5 more minutes, still no food.  We asked for the check and they even had the gaul to add the food that was NEVER delivered to the check.  We should have known when we say people ordering two beers at a time.  I (we) will never return and will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Oh boy. The negative reviews are warranted indeed.  I visited the rooftop bar. The drink list was adequate. I was worried they would have a crappy wine list, but it was good enough. The service at the bar is great, but once you get a table, look out.  The tables are first come, first served, and we grabbed a table from previous guests when they left. Nobody came to clean the table. We asked if someone could come over to wipe it up and nobody ever did. Nobody came to take our drink order. We asked the bus person if he would find us a server. He did. We then had to ask for menus. We then had to get up and get our server and ask her to take our order. They served the food on the dirty table.  As other reviewers have noted, the servers stand by the bar together instead of actually serving people.  Yikes. It's not worth the aggravation to go to this place."}
{"text":"No one at the door to seat us. After waiting a few minutes, we seated ourselves. Waited too long for our waitress, and after our drink and dinner order, waited way too long for our food. Ordered a bowl of Chili, and got a cup. Waitress apologized and very nicely said, \"Please keep the cup, I'll get you a bowl.\" Proper response. She came back in 2 minutes and said, \"I'm sorry, my manager said I have to bring the cup back to bring the bowl.\" Excuse me? I told her that was very poor customer care, and you are just going to throw the cup out, correct? I reached up and took the cup from her hand and said, \"no, I think I will keep the cup. You can tell your manager she is welcome to come and have a conversation with me.\"  The waitress was polite, the General Manager Tim Hauser came and had a charming conversation with us prior to this incident. But, the manager, Sharon, who apparently recently transferred from the Montford Brazwell's, seemed to display very poor leadership skills (not supporting her employees in their decisions in customer service), poor customer service response, (she should have come to the table and responded to the issue personally), and did nothing as a courtesy because of the incident. Brazwell's, patronage is precious these days. There are a lot of other restaurants competing for your business. Poor leadership can sink the whole ship. Perhaps Sharon is out of her league. Reconsider. Won't be back."}
{"text":"To say I had an incredible time would be an understatement. Primarily due to my server, Shayna! Her knowledge pertaining to the menu was impeccable! Professionalism, is important to me regardless of where I am. Not only was she eager to make me feel welcome, but her genuine work ethic set her aside from the other servers and bartenders. The rooftop bar is a great addition, with mildly different decor, it's as if it's a different restaurant. This wasn't my first time or last time visiting. Keep up the good work Shay!!!"}
{"text":"This is not to be confused with Brazwell's in Montford. This location does not live up to the reputation of its Montford location. I came in with my girlfriend after work ( I work in the industry) for a drink and was greeted by a very rude bartender. He approached me with a \"What do you want?\" Like I was bothering him. Asked him about his Merlot selection and couldn't tell me anything so I asked to give me a house Pinot noir. Then a girl walked up behind the bar, who I assumed was the real bartender came up and said hello and all she asked me was do I want a tab or keep it open I said \"Close me out\". She did and the bill was 18 dollars and some change for a house pino noir and a draft beer. I gave her a twenty and she turned around cashed it out, keeping the change and not even saying a thank you. This is not the only time this has happened at THIS location. Just sad when you go somewhere based on a brand with a reputation hoping for the same experience. My girlfriend and I go to the Brazwell's on Montford all of the time and will continuing going to that location. To me, if you have to ask, go to Duckworth's in Ballantyne, same feel but better service and a lot more beers to choose from."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us went one evening after work. Our food took almost an hour.  It was cold and lacking any kind of flavor. Of course appetizers came after the entrees, also cold.  While waiting on our food we basically had to yell just to talk to each other over the incredibly loud music.  This place is too small for live music.  More of a want to be upscale restaurant but can't get away from reality of a sleezy night club. Needs zero stars but review requires a star."}
{"text":"Love coming here for brunch, game day or just a drink after work. Laid back place with great service!"}
{"text":"This spot is a great to be hand-out spot.  Chill and relaxed area for people in 20's to 40's.  I think this is a spot to drink and share apps.  Great for a girls post-work night out.  I love it.  Bartender is fast and on it! No waiting for drinks, they are ready to go!"}
{"text":"I am unbelievably disappointed in the blonde manager Laura. She is a large hurt for your company. She was very disrespectful to my friend. If someone is not allowed to be in your establishment you pull them aside in private & explain in a calm matter. Not embarrass a guest in front of the rest of guests in your restaurant. By a vote of hands, this woman always looks like she smelled a fart. Not very inviting. Nor does she ever greet guests & ask how their experience was. I love your restaurant & my good girlfriends work there but I'm not going there as long as that miserable woman works there. But you just lost our whole crew bcuz of her."}
{"text":"I've tried coming to this place 3 times, and I'll never be coming back.   The first couple of times weren't bad at all. Me and my friends came in for pretty sweet drink specials each time and enjoyed ourselves.   The day after out last visit, I realized that me and my friend had left our credit cards. We've done this before, so me and my friends brother stop by brazwells to pick up the credit cards. After giving them my ID, they quickly brought me my card. My friends brother however had a more stressful experience.   They're twin brothers with the same last name so we thought there wouldn't be a problem. The girls at the front desk said they have to give the credit card to the person it actually belongs to, but one of them went to the back to ask the manager whether they could just give the card to my friend considering the circumstances.   This is where things went downhill.  An older lady came storming up to the front where we were making small talk while waiting on the news of whether we could get my friends Credit card. Without even greeting us, the lady said \"are you guys seating these guys or what\" and the girls at the front said no, but before they could even explain the situation she YELLED at ME AND MY FRIEND to get away from her host stand and LEAVE.!! One of the girls still had my friends ID in the back so this made no sense to us. Its like this lady had no clue what was going on and just decided to be a b****  Then, we found out this THIS woman is the GENERAL MANAGER! We were appalled by how rude this lady was. We were paying customers the night before and a time before that, and we were just trying to get our Credit cards  back. We did nothing to be yelled at like that.  After reading some other bad reviews on this place, I think this manager and this company ARE in fact RACIST. When we asked for her name, she quickly turned around and snapped \"Dawn\" while confidently stating that she's the new GM with a matter-of-fact smile like she was proud of the way she treated us.   After this, a nicer manager who actually knew what was going on told us she's so sorry but it's illegal to give my friend his brothers credit card in his absence. That's fair, but we still had such a sour taste in our mouths from \"DAWN\". No one even apologized to us, and the girls just sat back and looked surprised by this managers behavior as well. As if it were supposed to comfort us, one of the girls told us this isn't the first time someone has called her racist. Apparently she even told one of her black employees something like \"don't get all black on me\" when they were having a normal conversation. Don't get all black on me??? Really??? What's that supposed to mean??   One of the girls at the front also told us that they overheard \"Dawn\" telling other employees that this place is closing at the end of summer anyway. THAT WAS ACTUALLY COMFORTING.  I can definitely see why it would be closing and I really hope it does!!!!  Thanks for all your help, \"DAWN\".!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch because of the sign outside advertising. Awful. Dry toast and black burned bits in the waffles from the waffle iron which the chef turned upside down so it would not be immediately visible . I took a picture and will post it!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch on a Friday with some coworkers. Had the lunch special fish n chips. Food was tasty and portion size was big. Sat on the roof top and enjoyed the nice weather. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ok another review. This is my kind of hangout. Rooftop bar is the best when it not so hot out like NOW ! Great Servers and bartenders. Food is not gourmet but very edible . Great wings and not a bad beer selection . Very busy on weekends ."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a movie for drinks and appetizers. On a Saturday night, I would have expected the place to be busier. Bathroom floor was sticky and our table wasn't quite as clean as it should have been (a crumb or two). I expected better service for as slow as it was in there. Took a while for someone to come with menus and take our drink order. Food arrived quickly. Hummus was fine although the celery looked old so it was not touched. The chicken nachos did not have real cheese on them but rather that fake cheese sauce. I could have gotten that at the movies. I had to stand up and look for our server to get the check. Pretty bad when the only other people inside there were in the bar. Service might have been better outside. With all the other options around, this place better step up their game. We won't be back, though."}
{"text":"There is nothing premium about this place except the-outside space.  Price point is great. There is a reason. Medicare food. I saw a couple of waitresses who appeared to be doing a good job and helped us twice when our invisible waitress was not around. We wondered why surrounding venues were packed and there was no problem getting any table you might wish  here.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service and a great place to have a company luncheon.  The burgers, club and fish are really good and the pan cookie is seriously to die for!"}
{"text":"I am hoping our experience this evening was an exception to the typical experience at Brazwells, but i am not certain we will return to find out. The restaurant wasnt empty, but it was no where near packed either. We waited 55min for our food (we ordered fried pickles for an app, chicken wings and strips for a meal). All of the food arrived at the same time and the pickles were lukewarm. My order was supposed to come with chips. I asked our waitress, briahna, if my order was supposed to come with chips and she replied \"yeah it was. Do you want them?\" Why would i NOT want what i ordered?! We were informed there were only 2 people working in the kitchen, however this was admitted after we complained about the wait, and the wait staff, which we were not told they were short on, was lagging. We waited 15 for a water and 20min for the check. The only reason im giving 2 stars is because the food was decent and i feel some sympathy for the understaffed kitchen."}
{"text":"We celebrated the SuperBowl at Brazwell's and they REALLY had it together!!  The sound system was on point and there wasn't a bad seat at our table for viewing!!  Our waitress, Erica, was absolutely beyond amazing!  Hats off to Brazwell's.  I was thoroughly impressed!  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Everything was sort of fine but kind of pretty underwhelming. I expect premium to mean service that goes way above & beyond.  Walked in, & 3 TVs had the QVC network on, 2 more on some NFL network clip show, but no TV had the World Series on, nor the Hornets game. Are they paying attention or even trying?  Our awesome waitress Jessica got cut right as they were getting busy, & the bartender got slammed & couldn't keep up with her tables. Rest of the floor staff was a little unpolished. Not rude, just meh.  The fried pickles were ok, but too salty. The burger was fine but either the plate was huge or the little handful of fries too small. $6 for a draft beer is just too much.  Again, I expect 'over the top' friendly for these prices & 'premium' name. Too many staff walk around frumpy & annoyed looking. Oh, and don't charge me for an extra (low quality) blue cheese that you don't even make here. That's just petty."}
{"text":"Beer was warm.  Food was not cooked correctly.  One of us had the tuna salad and the tuna was raw.  I had salmon and spinach salad and the salmon was not cooked thoroughly. Our server had zero personality.  The servers all huddled around the hostess area with their cell phones talking. The women's bathroom was filthy and no toilet paper (and this wasn't at the end of the night but 4:30 in the afternoon).  We called the manager over to complain about the food and she was clueless.  She did remove the two salads from the bill but barely apologized and the server never acknowledged our complaints.   We had hoped to sit on the rooftop but the weather didn't cooperate.  I doubt the rooftop would have made the experience any better.  Such an incredible disappointment."}
{"text":"Went to Brazwells for my birthday on a week night.... well tried to. We met me Dad and Stepmom who were already seated on the rooftop when we arrived. No one was at the hostess station so we just headed upstairs. As soon as we sat down the waitress brought their drinks, which they had ordered 15 minutes prior, and said she would be right back. Well 20 minutes later and no one had even taken our drink order. They were fairly busy but we watched our waitress flirt with a table of guys behind us and gab with the bartender while we were hoping to at least order a beverage. When she finally returned we expressed our concern that food would take forever and she basically told us if we didn't want to wait we could leave. My stepmom informed her they would not be paying for their drinks and she rolled her eyes and said ok we will take care of them. No apology no attempt at service recovery. Just blatant apathy... also evidenced by the filthy table, menus and wine glass. Used to love this place but definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Scrumptious food! I went for lunch today with my boyfriend.  We had the delicious honey bbq wings. Then for our meals, I had an amazing three leveled sandwich called the American and my boyfriend had a burger.  Both meals came with fries and neither of us were able to finish our food! Great service.  Kind wait staff and we got to sit outside and enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Came back last night to give this place a second chance since our first one was not great. Can't say they redeemed themselves. Horrible service and the food is just not good. We arrived as a group of 3 for dinner around 830. Were told there was about a 15 minute wait because they were holding tables for a group of 35. After about 30 minutes I went to the hostess stand to ask if they knew hold much longer it would be. The waitress was clearly surprised to see me and said the hostess had left to go deliver a food order and they did not know we were waiting. What?! So we sat down. Waitress took a while to come over. We put in an appetizer order and drinks. She never came back to take our dinner order. She didn't come in to check on us and we had finished the appetizer and been waiting and already needed another round of drinks before we even ordered dinner. Buffalo chicken sandwich. Not good. Sweet potato fries. Great. Fried pickles great. Brisket platter. Awful. Then we waited so long for our check we finally went up and asked a random server to help us pay our bill so we could leave. It truly wasn't that busy to have had this kind of slow/poor service. This was actually a better experience than our first if you can believe it. I want to love brazwells due to its convenient location to my home and the rooftop bar but I just can't."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was abysmal, at best. We went out for lunch to celebrate my best friend, who is getting married tomorrow, and the service was very slow and unprofessional. The restaurant was not busy and our server was barely visible throughout our lunch. Jackie, our server, did not offer refills, check on us during the meal, and at the end piled up the check books and said \"they're not in order\" and left us, the guests, to pass them out. We were really looking to celebrate and have a good time and instead left feeling disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the rooftop! The staff seems to try to keep up when it's busy but it has been hard to get good service when I've been there, typically easier to go up to the bar to get drinks. Good atmosphere and good appetizers."}
{"text":"Every thing was awesome. Bloody Mary bar..... the greatest thing ever. We will be back for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with Sisters and daughter. It was Happy Hour.  Ordered some appetizers. The shrimp and fried pickles were given to us free. Guess someone ordered and decided against it? Who knows, it was yummy! The Loaded Pub Chips were delicious, as was the spinach and Artichoke with Pita bread. The wings were good too!"}
{"text":"I'm thinking that whoever is giving this place more than 1 star....MUST have been drinking enough to dull the poor quality food, limited/tired menu, terrible kitchen service, and boring, stale atmosphere.  I work in the corporate park, and went there today for lunch with a friend.  We ordered the chicken tenders platter, and a salad - and waited more than 25 minutes for it to come out of the kitchen!! Completely unacceptable for a corporate park eatery! If you're serving lunch on a weekday in a corporate park - you should be prepared to get people in and out during their lunch hour.  AND to top off the terrible experience with the service....the chicken \"tenders\" were nothing but.  They were over-breaded, and over-fried.  Shame on you Brazwell's.  I have no respect for a place that rests on just its ability to serve up cocktails."}
{"text":"If I could give this less than a star I would.  About a week ago 3 coworkers of mine and myself went in to Brazwells. Working in the service industry ourselves we did not expect to get exceptional service at 11 at night, but we did expect to get some kind of service. Once the waitress heard our initial drink order, 3 waters and a Coke, our waitress became very inattentive.  The two guys at the table next to us came in after we did and they were served their drinks way before we got ours ( maybe because they got alcohol). We waited for over 15 minutes for the server to come back to the table to take our order and when she did come over she was extremely rude. From there we waited for a good 30 minutes to get our food. The sweet potato fries were cold and extremely salty and the rest of the food was also cold. One of the other girls found a hair in her wings and we waited for the waitress to come over. We had been waiting for over 15 minutes for someone to come over and it was obvious that we needed something because we were looking around. We then had to get up and get what looked like the manager to come over to our table. We proceeded to tell him that we found a hair in the wings and his response was \"are you sure it's not a feather?\" The hair was about 8-10 inches long.... He offered to get her some new wings and she asked for them to go. We the proceeded to tell him about how awful the service was and he seemed uninterested and like he didn't care about the experience. We waited over 30 minutes for the wings to go until we had to go back up to the bar and ask if they were coming. The manager apologized and went to the back to get the wings that had most likely been sitting there for a while because they were cold. The experience from start to finish was horrendous!  I highly doubt that any of us will be back and we will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"OK. False advertising! It's not a pub, and it's NOT premium! You can TALK in a pub without having to scream over the insipid \"DJ\", and premium implies that this place might somehow be different than the dime-a-dozen, beer-and-wings, drunk -fest meat-markets that are Charlotte ubiquity.  We tried more than once, and initially were pleased, but like so many places like this in Charlotte, it only took a few times to see measurable decline. In short, save your money. In long form: The first time I left saying I'd Yelp this place, i didn't. I buckled. I just figured it was an off night and that the place certainly wouldn't always be that bad after starting off so well.  The first experiences we had were great. They had just transitoned over from Blackthorne though. The server couldn't have been better  (the taller brunette bartender with kind of wavy hair), and she fooled us into believing that the place didn't stink on ice. Went in late (after 11) the food and service rocked.  Couple of weeks later, same thing. Even the same waitress. Thought we'd end up regulars.  Next time in, a little off. The service was just OK (slow), the food was meh. For example, the coleslaw was room temp (not too good). Came in around 10 after a show, and the manager (the blonde manager accurately described in a previous review), hit us with a \"kitchen closes at 11\" as we come in the door. Seemed like hello or welcome might have been more appropriate, but I'm not in the restaurant business, so what do I know?  Nice way of letting people know that you no longer serve food past 11. Guess you can do that in Charlotte while you serve booze, right? Left a little more than disappointed as I said.  Did it again.   Why try it again, you ask? Foolish and hungry. The great Ballentyne isn't exactly the bastion of restaurants, so we gave it another shot last night. Went in after another show (10:30 again) to grab something quick, and could barely hear the hostess over the music. I did manage to get the question asked and answered if we still had time for food...\"Oh yes, the kitchen doesn't cut off until 11.\"  We were seated at a high top in the bar, and the shorter brunette bartender came over to take our drink order. She saw that we had menus and were looking them over, so you'd have to know we were planning to order food. She started to ask if we had any menu questions and walked away in the middle of asking the question. Literally in the middle of the word question. Strange, but whatever. A lttle chaotic, and a lot loud, so whatever. Moments later, she came back and dropped off drinks, said she'd be a moment. SHE DIDN'T COME BACK TO OUR TABLE FOR 25 MINUTES. That's right at 11 o'clock kids...remember the kitchen closing time? She strolls casually by and literally asks how we're doing. Not \"did you decide on anything from the menu\" mind you, since that would have been pointless. Even if she DID ask, who would want food from a place this slack that you ordered at just the last minute? Worse yet, she was just walking around from the kitchen to the bar mostly...even though it seemed as though one of the hostesses made a gesture towards us as though she was maybe forgetting something. Yeah, customers. We tabbed out and left.  Now understand, I'm not some old grandpa that got grumpy at that new-fangled noise and just wanted to gripe. I like a good bar as much as the next person, but that's all this is, a bar. As a restaurant or PUB, it's a king-sized fail. It has that \"burning a little too much in the back to get the job done out front\" feel that too many of these places in Charlotte do.    So if you're looking to hook up with some of that sweet I don't-want-to grow-up 30-something yuppiness that Charlotte is soooooooo famous for, you might try this place...maybe you'll get lucky if your income is good enough.  Otherwise, keep looking, and drive on by. I know we will be. Shouldn't have to think about it more than 6 months or so unless the booze keeps the doors open."}
{"text":"Drinks are always good. Food is what you'd expect. Nothing spectacular, but good with a cocktail or beer. In the past few visits we've noticed that the girls are wearing less and less. Today I literally saw a nipple hanging out of a girls shirt."}
{"text":"Monday night 11/21/2016 I came in with some friends, around dinner time. I was greeted by a lady, I believe her name was Stephanie. The greet was like a pain for her to even do, sub par. I take greetings very seriously, as I am firm believer in first impressions. We were eventually sat and Stephanie said she would send a server over. As inquisitive as I am, I watched her leave our table and chit chat with several employees and waited for about another 5 ish minutes. Still no server had come over. The restaurant was not that busy. So I took it upon my self to go to the bar and get myself and my guest our first rounds. For the record, I don't expect anything in return, I just want this situation to be heard and corrected. Because, I am not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"You appetizers are no.bueno, your beer was hot. You get the 2 stars because the staff is extremely good and offer a great service. I would give you another Chace bit pleas make yourappetizersworth while"}
{"text":"I can't really really tell you about the food because I only got a glass of water with extra lemon. Roof top dining (selling point) wasn't available because there wasn't enough server help on duty at 2pm. OK, I can except that. I joked with the hostess that she could be out server. She declined, and understandably so she was the hostess. Another nice young lady came out, my order wasn't ready to be taken but she did bring me water and explained that the server would be over shortly.  Someone came in, retrieved some boxes from the rooftop then proceeded to help another party that arrived after I did. Unfortunately, 22 minutes after I had arrived and picked all of the seeds out of my lemons. I decided to try 131 Main and their covered outdoor seating where Robby was very attentive and knowledgeable about the delicious fish tacos and club with hand-cut fries and malted vinegar"}
{"text":"Don't even know where to begin... horrendous service, food took 45 minutes... will only buy liquids from brazz going forward."}
{"text":"Met my parents here for lunch today. It was our first visit. The atmosphere was your typical pub-like bar. The music could've been a little louder. The service was good but the food was the best part of our visit! I got the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, my mother got the Matts Chicken Sandwich and my father received the Matheny Burger. All three meals were great!! We will definitely be back to try them again. They also have a rooftop bar that I am eager to check out!"}
{"text":"Cute spot in Ballantyne for dinner or lunch. And a rooftop bar, need I say more? Had the buffalo chicken wrap and fries. Food was better than I expected for a bar. Definitely a chill place to gather with friends and enjoy drinks. The only drawback is that they don't have draft on the roof, meaning if you're an OMB freak like me you have to order an alternative or schlep it downstairs."}
{"text":"I love the rooftop bar! The bartenders are very friendly. They also have an awesome Bloody Mary bar! Excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Great food & service. Best roof top bar around. This place is a must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Family member brought home a take out meal after they had a business meeting here last night.  This review is for the take out meal. It was for the Bone in Pork Chop. In fact, I reheated this meal today in the oven and the sweet potato mash went into the microwave.  Let me tell you. This dish is delicious. The Bone in Pork Chop was juicy and the grilled asparagus was tasty. The topping on the pork chop was Granny Smith apple Chutney which was not too sweet nor tart.  I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner here."}
{"text":"Horrible - everything about this dining experience was horrible. I do not expect them to be open another 6 months. The restaurant was practically empty on a Friday night - we sat upstairs on the outside patio at a filthy table. The burgers for my friends came out after 45 minutes (which were disappointing) - the waitress said my salad had never made it upstairs from the kitchen. Everyone ate while I waited another 30 minutes for my salad. It was awful - a plate full of lettuce. Never going back."}
{"text":"I visited during lunch and they were packed.  Must of been why it took 30 min. for the food to arrive.  Other than the speed of food the servers were friendly, attentive and apologetic.  Also the dish I ordered, Matt's Chicken sandwich, was delicious."}
{"text":"Came on a nice evening to sit on the patio and have a cocktail or two. Ordered the wings (lemon pepper and spicy teriyaki) and fried cheese. Both were good and so were the drinks. Service was a little slow but overall a cool evening"}
{"text":"Total disappointment. Our waitress messed up every order at every table she had. She kept apologizing because it was busy? The upstairs patio wasn't even full. She just didn't take the time to write orders down. The kitchen and hostess made things right but at that point I had already decided I would never return to this location."}
{"text":"Stacey Gordon Boyea  · 19 hours ago Several of my friends and I have gotten together at Brazzwell's for over a year every Thursday night. There have been several times they ran out of our beverage of choice among other issues, which we over looked. However, last night was the last straw and the worst experience. The server that waited on us, (if you can call it that), was very rude from the beginning, she got my drink order incorrect and then told her Manager that someone in our party cussed her out, which did not happen. Yes, he used a cuss word when talking to her but did not cuss her out and it was not directed towards her. This all took place while the couple ordered their 1st drink. When she brought the drinks back to our table she slammed them on the table and told them she is not waiting on them anymore and they will need to order from the bar. When I asked her if there was a problem she gave me what we thought was there tab which turned out to be the whole tables tab. Prior to seeing the tab, I asked to speak with a manager and she (the Manager) rude also. I asked if we could have another server and explained to the manager that the server was not cussed out and the server was very rude from the minute we came in the door. The manager informed me she would see if she what she could do, in a tone that she could care less if we ever got waited on again and of course we never got another server. We tried to get the original servers attention to correct the tab and she informed us she was no longer our server and would not help. After this happened our Thursday night get together will no longer be at Brazzwell's. Our Thursday night out consisted of at least 10 or 15 people which they have lost."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight (9/21/16) and had the steak kabob's as an appetizer.  Excellent taste and value.   Also friendly, attentive and quick service from bartender Felisha!"}
{"text":"Really, it's our fault: we should've known better. Prior to Braswell's being here, there was a poorly run restaurant, but with pretty good food, in this location. Brazwell's makes me really pine for mediocrity. We'd been to the Montford location and there was nothing to drink there, either. In the Ballantyne location, there are a few decent local beers; it's almost like there are 15 breweries in this city. Remembering that fact from the first time we were unlucky enough to be here, we stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for a beer. With beer, I thought maybe mozzarella sticks would be good. Unfortunately, those have to be cooked all the way through, especially when frozen garbage. Yeah, not good.   The service was... probably what one would expect. After a shift change, this new waitress came over wearing horrendous, offensive perfume. I've been in strip club bathrooms that smell better than this one.   New highlight! The manager bragging about a 95% health inspection! I'm assuming he's proud of that because it's the highest grade he's ever received.   Tl:dr never coming back, but if you go, don't go hungry."}
{"text":"Just picked up a togo order and I'm very disappointed. Ordered the buffalo shrimp app which comes with celery and ranch. Also ordered a veggie burger with cheese, avocado, ketchup and lettuce with a side salad. Veggie burger is not tasty, they did not put ketchup or avocado on my burger and I didn't even receive my side salad. What am I paying for? Clearly they do not care about what they are handing their customers because they do not double check the order."}
{"text":"Went on a double date with my husband for drinks and dinner on a Tuesday night. The place was not packed so we were able to get a table right away. The place is pretty small and very loud with all the people so it is hard to talk to one another. The drinks were quite expensive. I paid $7 for a glass of white strawberry sangria and it just tasted like white wine. And unfortunately they were out of the blackened sirloin steak and the bacon wrapped meatloaf. To me that was pretty shocking. I did end up eating the Matt's chicken sandwich which was just a normal grilled chicken breast sandwich. It wasn't much to write home about. They do have a rooftop bar which is quaint and fun to get drinks at. Not sure if I would"}
{"text":"The Ballantyne location is convenient to our office so we stop in for lunch from time to time for birthday lunches and with clients as well.  Service tends to be slow at lunch which is frustrating but it's not a fast food restaurant so okay.  I've had good and not so good experiences with this location and have given them numerous second chances, but no more.  I had a simple complaint today and the manager could not have been more indifferent or rude!  It was amazing.  I was completely floored.  In Charlotte, where pubs and restaurants are in abundance, Brazwell's better take a good hard look at their management if they want to stay around."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with friends.  The experience could not have been worse if they tried.  Took about ten minutes to be greeted, and woman who greeted us emphasised that she was not our server.  Our real server brought out our drinks and took our order.  Not one of the orders came out correctly.  Not one.  We didn't even modify anything.  Most (correct, I said most) of the ingredients listed on the menu were missing from the plate.  There was no one to point this out to as our server disappeared for several minutes. We tracked down a manager who never apologized but did point out that ours was not the first complaint she's had about our server.  She said she'd fix it.  We never saw her again.  A hostess brought out ramekins filled with our missing ingredients.  We then had to go inside to pay because server, manager, and ALL OTHER EMPLOYEES were nowhere to be found.  They screwed up every aspect of our brunch and i saw it happening to every other table around us.  You should be ashamed to call yourself a restaurant"}
{"text":"Horrible!!   service terrible.   Bartenders Terrible!!!    just wanted to make out with each other. Food,  SO BAD!!   I came home hungry and mad!!      So much garlic on vegetables, could not eat.     fried zucchini was eatable.     pork chops terrible.  asparagus horrible.   So disappointing!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service is horrible.  Even after the manager stopped by to resolve one issue the waitress is still MIA."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre and the food is awful.  If you like your food greasy and salty this is your place.  The fried corned beef and Brussels sprouts used to be amazing but not anymore.  The portion was definitely smaller and way over cooked with little to no corned beef. The kitchen needs a staffing makeover cause the current crew will have them closing their doors in no time.  Also....The women's bathroom floor was slick and dangerous.  I asked the server why the floor was like that and she said they have a water leak..."}
{"text":"Went in to have a few beers - bar not very big and has a HUGE pillar obstructing the view of the 2nd tv. Bar tender was nice, Bottle Corona was $3.00, other than that blah! Didn't even take a picture of anything"}
{"text":"It was fun to come here for a few drinks and some apps.  The service was eh, the girls on the rooftop seemed really stressed and it wasn't that busy but still sweet.  Wings were good, chicken nuggets were good but DONT get the nachos.  We brought our pup."}
{"text":"We love brazwells on montford, this location is not living up to the same standards. We went one Sunday for half priced wings ( which the montford location does every Sunday and Monday), we called ahead and they said they had the same special so we went. Went back the next Sunday, exactly one week  and they were not doing the special anymore. When you carry the same name as another restaurant in town, your customers expect CONSISTENCY. If you don't want to be consistent don't carry the same name. Staff is horrible, none of them look like they want to be there. The montford location does WAY better from staff, to food and to consistency between visits. Don't waste your time, just head to the montford location if you want a better experience."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day, but I was disappointed in Brazwell's in Ballantyne.  Hopefully they will improve or they won't be around for long!  Overall, the menu consists of \"decent bar food\", with lots of choices and what appears to be house made items - the hummus on our appetizer and dressing on our salads was house-made, I think.  Brazwell's has lots of opportunities to excel, but it takes skill and a coordinated effort that we didn't experience.  It was a beautiful day, but restaurant staff set up only one umbrella on the patio. We had to sit right next to the only other diners out there to get any shade.  I think we might have been unlucky to get an inexperienced server.  Our order wasn't complicated.  We had some specific requests on our salads that were only partially fulfilled.  We were there for nearly 2 hours - not a great choice on a work day!  I am hesitant to return, but might, since I work in the area."}
{"text":"We finally tried this location after living in Ballantyne for a year and somehow visiting the Montfort location much more often. We came for dinner on a Saturday night and wanted to sit outside. It had started to get a little chilly so we asked the hostess if there were heat lamps upstairs. She told us all but one (the one over the bar) were broken. We went upstairs and were luckily able to find places at the bar. The rooftop bar is lovely and our bartender was very friendly. We ordered drinks and they were well made. I ordered the salmon blt which I LOVE at their other location. When asked if I wanted white or wheat bread I asked for wheat. Hubby ordered the meatloaf. My blt came out on huge slices of what looked like Texas toast. I'm not one to complain so I tried it anyway. It was probably one of the saltiest things I ever tasted. I figured I didn't need the extra carbs and tried to eat the salmon without the bread, it was still very salty. My friend gave me some of her rice and that kind of helped me get it down, my stomach did not feel great after the huge amount of sodium intake. The fries were okay, not especially fresh or warm. Hubby inhaled his food so he was happy. I'd give a 4 for service and a 2 for food (which is basically the opposite of what I think of the other brazwells location). It seems like based on other reviews there must be someone in the kitchen very heavy handed with the salt. I think we'll come back and try to brunch as their drink specials are pretty great."}
{"text":"Megan bar person was OK as well was the barback with all of the tattoos  Ordered blue cheese burger with fries very good and cooked exactly how I ordered it  Also ordered a Blue Moon draft beer and it was good A little surprised when I received my bill for $16.00+ Burger price was $10.00 which was good value But the $6.00 for the blur moon I think Is a little pricey because other restaurants nest by only charge between $4.75-$5.00 Restsurant clean and neat but I was the only one sitting st the bar Maybe they should lower the draft beer prices Will go back"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience of my life. Terrible service. Food took forever and was cold. Waitress didn't know what a wheat beer is."}
{"text":"Dawn, the new owner came up and talked with us during brunch. Made us feel like a million bucks and the food was great. The margaritas were ON POINT!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night because the drink specials and menu seemed appealing. Our waitress didn't come to the table for 10 minutes. I was hoping the only time I would have to wait longer than 10 minutes tonight was for my SO to fall asleep so I could watch Gossip Girl. White sangria was a cheap as the lady standing on the corner of Tryon. The buffalo chicken sandwich was clearly frozen and set under a hot lamp for the majority of its time. The atmosphere was a bit awkward as they advertise a kids eat free night right next to their sign for \"sinful sundays\". The only thing sinful in this place is the quality of service. Food was about as mediocre as Stewart's running back career for the Panthers. 3 stars because the rooftop bar was the closer I had been hopeful for; more clutch than Kimbrel."}
{"text":"This has been my worst dining experience in Ballantyne to date. My party of 14 arrived at 11:30. All orders were in before 12:00 and the last person in our group received their food at 12:55. This food was taken to go and the order was completed incorrectly. I watched our tickets sit on the board while later orders left the kitchen. The person working the pass did not have a sense of urgency when it came to our order. My fish and chips looked good but that is where it ended. The fries were ice cold. No replacement was offered until the time of my departure. I opted to take my fish to go. When I attempted to eat my fish back at work, I discovered it was under cooked. This was your one and only strike. I will not return."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time to have brunch. The food was delicious, some of us had brunch some had lunch but all round really good food. The service was all over the place. Our main server came by only a few times and seemed super rushed and she had 3 other servers come by to help out."}
{"text":"The crab dip was good. The salmon salad was just ok. I didn't like the dressing. The drinks are weak. I had a Long Island top shelf and couldn't taste the alcohol. The outside people were smoking cigars. They also have a rooftop but I didn't go up there. Seems like a cool place for happy hour that's about it."}
{"text":"Okay drinks and okay service. It did take two tries to get hot soup but the other apps were pretty good. I would e appreciated the lady sitting at the bar not having her feet up there picking her toes but she was on break and needed to relax I guess."}
{"text":"Not good. The food truly sucks.  The drinks are mediocre (but reasonably priced). The cleanliness is subpar (tip: use GLOVES to handle the menus). The barbacks invite themselves to hang out at your table and be a part of your night. The only good things about this place are the outdoor seating and the fond memories of the amazingly well prepared and thoughtfully considered food of Blackthorne which used to be in that location. Night and day difference in taste of food!!!!!  Next time I'll just pack a snack."}
{"text":"Went to Brazwells for the first time last night with my sister. It wasn't incredibly crowded. Just small groups of people gathered around to watch the football games. Decor is nice and the DJ was good. My sis had the Buffalo chicken sandwich that she raved about. I had the brisket sandwich which was equally good. We both had the sweet potato fries and I would have been happy with a second serving of them...they were delicious! Forgot to mention we also shared the blue crab dip as an appetizer and that was all that and a bag of pita chips! I will definitely go back."}
{"text":":( Terrible experience from beginning to end. We walked in for brunch and immediately noticed a wet dog?? type of smell. Whatever I can get over that.  My husband doesn't eat pork and specifically ordered something that did not contain any by the description on the menu. Food came out with pork gravy on top and had to be sent back.  We had probably 5 different \"waitresses\" and they would drop things off and run off before you could ask them for anything.  They never brought any condiments to the table or offered and we had a hard time getting anyone's attention.  I asked for a coffee refill 3 times to 3 different people. It seems like the only hiring criteria is to look decent in shorts that your butt cheeks are hanging out of.  No personality or work ethic required. There are so many ho-hum \"Americana\" type restaurants like this nowadays that you've got to have excellent service to stand out.  We finally got an empty Texas Pete bottle delivered to our table. There was a television playing behind us that had some guys head getting run over one minute and a couple dry humping the next.  This is the kind of thing that seals the deal on us never returning."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had dinner and were caught off guard when we received the check-- 1st of all my girlfriend ordered the PRIME RIB SPECIAL -- that is exactly how she ordered it--well the server charged her full price $18 and said she couldn't do anything because that is what she ordered-- INCORRECT!! in other words my girlfriend was called a liar and she didn't even offer any compensation -- not even an apology! THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE!! Then she gave me a menu that had the meatloaf on special for $9- I said \"I will have the meatloaf special\" and she took the order!! Said nothing that I was ordering off the lunch menu--- didn't apologize for that either so we paid the bill and left -- very very disappointed AND OUR 1st TIME AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT -- I never complain but this was WRONG AND I FEEL THAT WE WERE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF and the server didn't care! Was  the server (Kendal) just worried about getting off her shift and not caring about her customer service??? This dining experience was totally ruined by the lack of menu knowledge and concern for her guests - she needs to be re-trained and management needs to be aware how guests are treated and take responsibility for her service mistakes."}
{"text":"Don't go here. It's a high end establishment high end prices and no end everything else. If you want to roll the dice by all means but you'll pay $200 for passing go. You remember the movie European Vacation where they got the TV dinners at the French restaurant? Chevy Chase got that idea from this place. Y'all are my friends so don't let yourselves down."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great wait staff, very friendly and attentive. Best Cobb salad I've had in a long time, bountiful and fresh. Was our first time there, but won't be our last!!"}
{"text":"So, TGIF right? We went in for a drink/ lunch this afternoon. Since it was a pretty day, we decided to sit on the rooftop. The weather was the only thing good about the place! It took over 2 hours only to receive food that included pink chicken, overcooked burger and dry fish. In one case, the waitress only brought in a drink that was ordered as we were first seated when she brought him the check. And finally, it took her 30 minutes to bring our cards back. Never ever going back.. ever!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I come to this place, the first two times for lunch and today for diner. I can't complain the service has been great and the food pretty good, the buffalo chicken wrap is my fav, the fish and chips are pretty good choices as well. The only complain I have is the sticky tables  not sure what they use for cleaning but just not working out, even the floor is a little sticky. I haven't tried their upstairs area looks like fun. But yes I recommend this place, try it out!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today! Service was awesome...thanks Shea!...food was spot on! Drink specials were great, too! Manager stopped by to make sure things were on par!...everybody made us feel like we were special."}
{"text":"The visits here are hit-n-miss types. Leaning more towards the miss side of things.   The last visit they were frustratingly understaffed due to apparent call-outs. Obviously not at the fault of the server that was asked to stay. She was great in trying to do her best, but obviously didn't want to be there and certainly wasn't getting any help from the management.  The food is okay."}
{"text":"I came here for a bachelorette party. We sat outside upstairs on the rooftop. We were lucky because it's first come first serve and we didn't wait long at all. The view is great. The server was very sweet but she had a lot of tables so we didn't have the best service.    I always order a Malibu Bay Breeze drink. It's pink colored. When I ordered it, it was orange. I asked what was in it and she said Malibu, orange juice and pineapple juice. Ah, take out the orange juice and add cranberry juice and that would be my drink order. No biggie, I just asked her to add some cranberry juice. Once we got our drinks, we ordered 3 appetizers. The cheese sticks were delicious. Fried pickles were good too. After we ordered our apps, we never saw our server. We waited and waited. She never once came by or asked if we wanted to order dinner which we did. We finally stopped her and ordered our food.   I got the cobb salad. It was well worth it and filling. Several people got the wraps and someone ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. It was all good and we inhaled our food because we waited so long.   Overall, it's decent. The food was good but service definitely needs to improve."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening with a large group of about 10. I understand that's no easy task for any one or two servers, so there were quite a few hiccups. The server was very nice and could tell she was trying her best. The mishaps consisted of missed appetizers (we ordered a lot of food so didn't care as much), a gnat in one of the 3 melon shots, and back and forth due to forgotten requests such as silverware, napkins, etc. Also, one of our friends ordered the brisket and was expecting a dry rub but theirs is doused in barbecue sauce, which is a sign the beef is generally dry.  Seems like a fun spot otherwise, but I wouldn't expect much if you're going for food."}
{"text":"This place is just not very good, it suffered from multiple issues from kitchen to bar.  I was with a friend and we sat at the bar and ordered a few things: a dip appetizer, chicken tenders, burgers.  The dip appetizer while tasty was meager especially for the price.  The chicken tenders were cooked to shit and fries were soggy, unseasoned, and bland.  I was also never offered or able to request a dipping sauce.   The service was pretty terrible at the bar.  Between eating her dinner behind the bar and socializing with staff our waitress paid little attention to us--despite the place being pretty dead.  We ordered two separate beers and she didn't give the right one to either of us.  One of us asked for salt and pepper, she forgot about it and then randomly remembered and brought it just before we asked for our bill.  I hate to be harsh because she was nice but just no attention being paid.  My beer was in warm cups both times so even though the draft was cold initially, it warmed quickly.   When you add all these faux pas up and then look at the cost/value it's a disaster.  Hickory Tavern wipes the floor with this bar food wise.  There were rumbles that the rooftop bar is fun but that can't be all a spot is good at. Won't be coming back here for anything but drinks in the future--eat elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Save yourself some time and frustration.  My office likes to go here frequently for happy hour as it's within walking distance of our office, but after our last experience we are going to look for a new place as this place just isn't worth it. The service is consistently bad.  People frequently standing around looking for a server so they could order a drink. The last time we were here I was standing with my party for 40 minutes, and was never asked, even once, if I wanted a drink.  Other folks went up to the bar and waited for 10 minutes trying to get served, and it wasn't even busy!  It was 4:30 on a weekday (not Friday) afternoon! The rooftop deck is nice, but it is no longer enough of a draw and we are going to find a new place."}
{"text":"Best fried pickles/fries in town, but I cant get past the dirty menu and sticky tables. Hopefully, the manager can get off their a#$& and address the uncleanliness.  My wife's chicken was dry last visit and the portion size of my fried pickle appetizer seemed to be reduced.  Otherwise, everything tasted great for me in all of my visits. Staff is always nice."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent flyer of this place since it's across the street from my job. I'm surprised to see what the other reviews have been as almost all of my visits have been wonderful.   I usually go during the lunch hour, either at the bar of I'm by myself or grab a booth if I have a friend with me.   Bar staff is amazing. They know my usual by now which speeds up ordering, especially when I have to get back for a meeting. I know I can go and get in and out in 30 mins and that'd eating in.   Table service is good but not as great. Service has been a bit slow at times. Though they're always friendly.   Now into the food. I have to say that I'm really impressed no matter what I order. Food is fresh and most is hand made. For example I love the chicken tenders. They are hand breaded and the flavor is amazing. The BBQ sauce is a high quality too. And the sweet potato fries are super fresh and so tasty. And it's enough food to split into two meals... all for under $10. Can't beat that.   I've also visiting twice for Sunday brunch and again I was blown away. Got eggs, bacon, toast and mimosas both times. Food was fresh, real eggs and quality bacon and the mimosas were strong. Best Sunday brunch I've found in the area so far.   Parking can be tough if you drive (I walk on work days). It's in a strip mall with some very busy stores and restaurants so patience is needed on that front.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Brazwell's is our go to place when we are looking for a casual night out. Our waitress Hayley always serves us with a smile and takes great care of us. I would love for them to bring back the shrimp and grits on the regular menu but we really have never gotten a dish we didn't love. The zucchini fries are the best! It's a great place to meet friends or enjoy some family time."}
{"text":"Terrible service... i literally sat up on the rooftop for 2hrs and not one time did i have a server come up to the table and ask if i needed anything... a drink nothing i do not recommend coming here. terrible!! if i could give them zero stars I would.. and not only are the servers very rude and just looked at me."}
{"text":"Buffalo shrimp have a great crunchy coating and proper buffalo heat. The blue cheese was delicious.  Also had the fish and chips with sweet potato fries and the piece of fish was huge. I believe it was catfish and it had a Creole batter that was very thin almost like a skin all the way around. It was delicious, fresh, and flaky. Also the tartar sauce was off the charts and  sweet potato fries were good. They were almost shoestring style with a nice salting.  Dirty martini up with Bombay Sapphire gin was pro."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying that I've been here 3x & Kim is the best server ever. She was on it! Super sweet, on time, & friendly. She gets 5 stars.  The food is lacking!!! I ordered the spring salad with seared tuna. The tuna, wasn't fresh. Not bad enough for me to complain, but it tasted like it had been frozen and recently thawed. Boyfriend got a blackened chicken salad, nothing special. I'm giving 3 stars because you will pay a premium for just okay food.   Bottom line, good place with a rooftop bar to grab a drink. Not so great food that will cost you too much."}
{"text":"They get pretty overwhelmed at the lunch hour - mostly corporate park folks on a tight timeline. If you only have an hour and arrive after 12, expect to be a little late. That said, my favorite is the Cobb salad with blackened chicken. It's what salad dreams are made of! The staff are all friendly, but it's pseudo hooter-like in terms of the atmosphere. Yoga pants and all. They've stepped things up from the previous restaurant/owners so I'm optimistic they'll last for awhile. Great for Friday evening rooftop happy hour after work too....."}
{"text":"Just had a good lunch and AMAZING service from Kirsten. We have been here a few times and haven't had the best experience but Kirsten really made our lunch great. She was prompt, personable and positive. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fri nite happy hour.  Buffalo shrimp with fish and chips very good.  Nice to have beer specials on a Fri nite.  Staff very nice.  Only downside was rooftop bar and deck packed, even at 4:45pm.  Upside, we had the inside bar all to ourselves- nice atmosphere.  Wanted to leave review as I have read others that are not so good."}
{"text":"We sat upstairs on a Saturday night. Cute, cool place. Waitress was a little ditzy but so sweet. Ordered the drink special and got something totally different. My friends got beers and we the hummus and the buffalo shrimp. The hummus came with pita bread s usual. The buffalo shrimp was a nice portion of big, fresh shrimp battered and came with ranch or blue.. I liked those a lot.  Bf ordered the cheeseburger and it was overlooked, sent back, the manager came over apologized but it was overcooked again. We kept it this time tho and it was delicious regardless !! The manager took both off the menu. Overall. The food was good, the manager did the right thing and we were happy."}
{"text":"Stopped in to meet a friend for happy hour.  It was 1/2 price appetizers until 6:00.  My server told me I had 10 minutes left and I wasn't aware of the special.  Thank you to my server!    I had a glass of the Malbec, it was pricy but delicious.  The draught prices were decently priced- $6.00 for a pint.    We ordered the buffalo shrimp and it was good, a little spicy so watch out!  Service was stellar.  For as busy as they were, she was very attentive.  I would definitely go back for another happy hour."}
{"text":"First time here today. Opted for the rooftop bar area. Sat down but couldn't get a server to even look at us. They were attentive to the tables around us but not us. So, we left. Went downstairs and are inside. Thankfully, we were tended to and she was awesome. Zucchini appitizer was really good. Shrimp and grits were great with the exception of the sausage. Tasted like a cheap hot dog. The grits and gravy made it worthwhile. The burger with pimento cheese and bacon was also great. Huge. Fries were good as well. I'll be back, just need better service on the rooftop."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was great. The service was outstanding and people actually seem to care.  The food came out quickly and everything was perfectly prepared.   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent results.   First visit was great,  prompt service,  friendly staff,  nice atmosphere.  Sweet! Let's go back!   Second visit was good. Slightly slower service, still a nice staff, atmosphere was a little more noisy but not unbearable.   Next visit was ok.  Our waitress seemed to forget she had customers.  I say this because I watched her stand in the kitchen area while fixated on her cell phone. Now,  maybe she was having some sort of family crisis,  but if it was that serious she shouldn't have been at work.   Finally got a drink order in and the bartender got fancy and added a cherry to my drink.  I'm allergic to cherries. When I asked for a spoon to rid my drink of the throat closing fruit, the waitress questioned me. ....  Excuse me?  If I want a spoon it shouldn't matter if I want to get a cherry out of my drink, use it to play drums on the table, or beat you upside the head with it!  Just bring me a freaking spoon.   This place is very hit and miss, if you get the right waitress and come at the right time it's actually not a bad place.  The rooftop bar is great, that's half the reason we return. Bottom line,  don't expect premium anything,  it's just a bar in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"I lowered my standards walking in here. So much regret. Worse than prom night. I like my beer cold. They got that right. I like my mozzarella sticks hot. I miss Blackthorne's. The poor girl writing out the menu took at least... more than two beers for me. She received a nice groping from the chef. Man, I ain't coming back."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with $2 mimosas. Visiting from San Francisco. I had the BBQ chicken breast and it was alright chicken mean was kind of hard. It was my first time so I'd love to come back and try more items. Thank you Anna!"}
{"text":"Service is sloooooow on the rooftop. We sat down right away and waited about 20 minutes for someone to even acknowledge we existed. There were easily 5 other empty tables and plenty of employees. I noticed them because they all looked like they hated their lives. We were just about to get up and leave when we someone finally said and I quote \"What do you want to drink?\". No hi, sorry for walking by 20 times and acting like you had the plague, nothing. The only reason I'm adding a star is because the drinks were cheap."}
{"text":"The guy who brings his own beer koozie is the least weird person here. This place has bad vibes."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and appetizer. Ordered wings (average) but the celery they served was old, brown and dirty!! We asked for fresh celery and the next plate was just as bad. We encouraged them to throw it away!! We ordered a beer that came 3/4 full. Will not waste our money coming here again. There are way better places that serve fresh food and full drinks."}
{"text":"Bar atmosphere ok. Food not great. I asked server if the Caesar salad had homemade dressing, she said yes. Dressing definitely not homemade. Tasted like cheap bottled. Have no plans on going back."}
{"text":"I want to commend Braswells! Today it was packed due to Mother's Day and the team handled it like a dream. I was impressed that our waitress kept us updated on the status of our food during our wait. We did wait 50 minutes for our food but the time flew by because of how the team took care of us. At the end of our meal Dawn the manager came to greet us and apologize for the wait. I was again impressed by her professionalism. She is the new manager and I have full confidence in the direction this restaurant is going!  The food was delicious! I had the tuna wrap. I highly recommend it!  Thank you Dawn and the Brazwells team for making our experience great!"}
{"text":"Place seems nice. Quite right now in a Monday. Good service so far and lots of TV's for the sports. There seems to be more employees than customers right now.    Atmosphere is good and on a weekend I can see this place being good.   Beer a bit warmer than I like but that's a preference. Many local bars keep their glasses in the freezer that delivers a much colder beer.  Not the case here.    I will update once I try the food.   Will come back for another visit."}
{"text":"Must check out the rooftop bar here. A sweet relief from the same old same old in Charlotte. Cool vibe and reasonably priced drinks and food."}
