{"text":"Horrible Service. Ricky the \"manager\" is rude and unhelpful. It took 18 minutes to get our food, and when we complained our  check was refunded but then Ricky took the food out of my hands and told me \" you can't have no free food\" horrible and shameful. Dave would roll over in his grave if he knew what was going on."}
{"text":"I usually would give 4 stars to Wendy's as I always find their food quality good, service acceptable, and I have a \"free frosty\" keychain. However, this Wendy's has more restrictive hours than most other Wendy's. They are not open until 9 am, while my experience with other Wendy's has been that they are often open at 6 or 7 am. Since this is located smack in the middle of Tempe's ASU area, I would expect that they open at least by 8 am as there is a ton of demand for fast food in that general area."}
{"text":"I think if you go to Wendy's you know what you are getting into and compared to some of the other Wendy's it's pretty good. I've gotten food poisoning at Wendy's in my home town, so when i tried this place in Phoenix it was pretty good and didn't make me sick. Granted, it's never going to be perfect, this is fast good not fine dining.  In my personal experiences, I've never had a problem, but i think it varies from person to person."}
{"text":"The food here is NEVER fresh, you can tell it all sits under heat lamps.. too many times I have ordered food without mustard or without mayo to have it slathered all over my order. The salads usually have wilted lettuce and a foul smell...  I now drive the extra few miles to go to the one on baseline and rural. I agree with the previous review.. they have let me down time and time again."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through this visit. Ordered a chicken asiago ranch sandwich with a side salad. Service was good, nice people. It took a little bit to get food, but that usually means it's fresh. Got the food and went home. Probably the best chicken sandwich I have had in a long time! It was fresh, great lettuce and had huge pieces of bacon! Hope the next time is like this! The only problem is they forgot dressing for my salad, but luckily I had ranch at home."}
{"text":"I get so frustrated when you get home and most of the order is incorrect or items are missing. What more do I need to say about that? The interior is surprisingly dirty/messy, especially considering the location.  The last time I dined at this location I said out loud that I can't believe the condition of this place and had I known I would make the choice to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"It has been years since I have been to Wendy's.  I saw the commercial for the bacon portabella on brioche.  I know better than to expect anything from a commercial.  I was right.  Odd night only a few minutes to get something and Wendy's was next door.  I wanted to believe the commercial.   Great bread cheese mushrooms on a thick burger.  Nope.  It was a darker bun that tasted like any cheap bun, maybe three sliced mushrooms, barely any cheese on a flat bun.    2 Stars because it is fast.  Nice staff this night via drive thru.  It is fast food next weekend might be a different crew.  One of my many reasons for not visiting fast food is the poor wages."}
{"text":"The food was decent, and they have some crazy soda machine with like 1000 flavors (ok not really that many, but a frikn lot.)"}
{"text":"Have been extremely interested in trying out the new pretzel burger ever since my buddy told me about Wendys experimenting with the prezel bun.  While hanging out with my buddy that told me about it, we decided to give it a try. We finally arrived and there was no info on that burger. We asked the cashier and she said that it launched today but they dont have anything about it in store, but if you go thru the drive thru its on the menu. We went ahead and ordered it. We got the meals, upsized to large.  Total bill was about $22 for the combo's large sized. Extremely over priced especially being at a fast food resturant. Was hoping it was going to be delicious, but it was just okay. I would definitley never get it again unless they changed it up. The bun wasnt soft and chewy as it should be. It should have been way more delicious.  Wendy's, you gotta step it up......."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's for their spicy chicken nuggets in the value menu! It used to be 5 pieces now it's only 4. But they are so good, lol. And the buns they use for their dollar burger are so soft and good better than mcdonalds.   Only thing I'm not liking is the damn drink machine! I'm all about forward thinking and hi tech gadgets, but a computer mixing drinks is not the business. I don't know what formula they Used to mix a cherry coke but it taste more like extra strength NyQuil cherry to me. Good for when you want nostalgic feeling of your mom making you down that shit before bed, not good with bomb diggity spicy nuggets."}
