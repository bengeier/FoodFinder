{"text":"Food is decent and close to home but the service is HORRIBLE. The girl making our lunch literally rolled her eyes at us no less than half a dozen times. It seemed as though making a couple of donairs was the most inconvenient thing in the entire world. My husband and I will think twice about going back. I've never been treated so rudely with so few words spoken."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, if you want to intoxicate yourself and your dear ones, give it a try! It would be better for us as a family to throw the 50 $ we spent there in the garbage than having this experience."}
{"text":"Some employee named \"Moe\" was extremely rude and I saw him spit in my food!!!! Unbelievable!!!! He then pretended that nothing happened! He also had some kind of white fluids on his hand and I am SURE it was not the sauce! Absolutely disgusting i almost threw up just looking at him! Never go here!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was only okay, though my boyfriend enjoyed his chicken shawarma much more than I enjoyed my beef donair. The donair meat was dry and they microwaved it after cutting it off the rotisserie. Also for some bizarre reason they offer cheese on donairs... I abstained. There was tons of sweet sauce on my donair but I had to ask her to open it back up to put hot sauce on, and I don't think she put any garlic or other sauce on it.  Contrary to what other reviewers said I found the service friendly enough, or at the very least not rude. I thought it was hilarious that they have 7 different sizes for their donairs, from child to Tyrannosaurus, with Delux, Super, and Sasquatch falling somewhere in between there.  I probably won't return - there are way better donair places much closer to home."}
{"text":"I was just there 10 mins ago. The tall guy working had an open cut on his hand! No gloves or anything, just handling your food with an open wound that I could clearly see inside. It was on his finger. Disgusting. The customer before me didn't want a sauce that they automatically put on, so instead of making another one he scraped if off with his fingers and tongs. yes, the finger that had the open wound. It touches every single food item that you will eat.  Very unsanitary. Lettuce and tomoatos are usually rotting. Why do I keep coming back here? Very good question, time to stop I guess. When its good its good, but this was disgusting."}
{"text":"Been going here forever. Definitely my favourite donair restaurant in Calgary. The owner is one of the friendliest, warmest people. :)"}
{"text":"This place is good if you're an the area and don't want to pay for a restaurant meal, but want something better than the Little Caesar's next door.  Like others have said, it's very standard. The food isn't bad, but I certainly wasn't blown away either. It's fine if you're just hungry and want an overall okay meal."}
{"text":"the staff is extremely rude and always talk in Arabic infront of you and giggle and laugh and look at you like they are talking about you making fun of you. The attitude they have while working is very discouraging and makes you not want to come back they act like they don't wanna be working they always look like they've had the worst day of work. Customer service and customer relations is KEY in a business like Pita Stop. they aren't going to have a business much longer if they keep it up. The owner needs to fire all staff and rehire a new staff it will 100% increase his sales and regular customer base.   I can't even count how many times they don't even bother asking what I want they just assume and they end up putting ex.. Tomatoes and onions on cause 9/10 ppl get it on there donair so they assume I want it... I then tell them that's not what I wanted and they snicker and get attitude and talk under there breathe like it's my fault they didn't bother to ask.   they have to microwave there meat now before placing it on the donair because people got really sick cause of there under cooked meat. the health board shut them down for a bit.   I could go on for hours about this place!!!. The owner himself is extremely cheap!! The place is a dump and over priced. They don't put nearly enough sauce on donair they make you buy a side of sauce for $2 for a huge donair that you have to refill 3x so your paying $6 in extra sauce.   They never follow there official store hours they have written down and plastered all over the windows and in store!!!. I can't count how many times I've gone to get a donair and they are closed and the hours snow they are suppose to be open!. I've been inside eating a donair and they close at midnight it was 11pm and they were already starting to shut grills down and wash floors and put food away time I was done eating it was 1130 and by that time they are basically forcing me out saying they are closing!. I sat in my cAr and watched them leave and lock up 20min before midnight!!!!!. - to me closing at midnight means you shut down grills, wash floors, put food away and whatever else at 12:01am 1min after midnight close!! If I come in at 11:59pm I expect to be able to get a Donair and anything else on the menu"}
{"text":"I went to EP Scarlett so this place was right next to the school. Popular lunch place. And, at that time, the school cafeteria food was terrible. A+1 didn't offer much, subway sandwiches aren't warm enough, so I tried this place when I didn't have a lunch. Beef domain is my favourite, always ordered that, in fact the staff knew my order when they saw me. I agree that they should be wearing gloves but I haven't had any issues with the food. Price us reasonable, $8 will get you donair snd a small pop."}
{"text":"Quality and service have dropped sharply since the owner stopped working here. Used to be my favorite. Now i drive further to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been before and remember not being too impressed, but decided to give it another shot. The previous reviewers comment about everything being the bare minimum was spot on. The food is at best average, and the amount of toppings, even when requested to be extra, are laughable. Lacklustre service, small portions and no real care here. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The donairs here are yummy but only if you get the chicken donairs and variations of that. The staff was friendly to me personally but I see that some none-middle eastern reviewers found them rude for speaking another language; I couldn't tell the difference!"}
{"text":"This small and foreign family owned business I've been going to since i was in high school makes a mean beer donair. The service is shy, the food's decent and  the atmosphere does feel middle eastern with the Arabic music."}
{"text":"I will try it again but when I went it was the bare minimum, no more no less. I liked the taste of everything except for the pink pickled turnips, which I usually like, but this time they were too pickled? The flavour was off somehow.  Even my colleague who ordered a donair pita thought it was mediocre. Before we ate he said he likes that the brush the pitas with some garlic oil or garlic butter and then they press grill it in the Panini machine. He said sometimes it's really good but maybe it was just the girls that made our food that day. The staff seemed unenthusiastic, bored, again, the bare minimum. No extra flair here!  I ordered a donair salad. It was a very small serving. The ingredients were mediocre, not outstanding. Canned pre-sliced black olives. Iceberg lettuce. The sauces we're OK. Not bad. When I'm desperate I'll give it another shot, another day."}
