{"text":"Ate there for the first time on a Saturday afternoon and it was the some of the worst food ever!! Such a disappointment for a new restaurant with a nice ambiance. Ordered French Onion soup which came out cold and tasted  so bland no flavor what  so ever!!! Sent it back waited another 20mins for a hot one to come out, than we order  the mushroom/gruyere steak burger it came out cold with burnt cold fries also and no flavor again!! side of brussel sprouts were rock hard and barely warm, Asked for rolls with the soup and they finally came out after the burger had been delivered. At least the rolls were nice and hot! Noticed everyone around us waiting at least 40 min for food (and it wasn't even busy) and returning items also not a very good day for the kitchen/chefs obviously.  Manager asked us how everything was and we told her how disappointing everything was and all she could do is say how sorry she was. Obviously she  was not going to offer anything free or take something off the bill. WILL NOT EAT THERE AGAIN!! Not sure what is up with the new JACK CASINOs and their food but not good at all!!"}
{"text":"Very good for a casino. I would say best restaurant in a casino in the Cleveland market. Had the walleye finger appetizer and the flat iron skirt steak. Both very good !! Will try again."}
{"text":"Went to Millcreek Grille for the first time today.  The decor is very well done.  We were only the second table of customers in the restaurant.  We were seated immediately.  Very friendly front door staff.

The wait time for our server to come to the table for the first time was a bit longer than what I would have expected.  There were about 5 people walking around the near empty restaurant.  Yet it took probably 10 minutes before our server actually came to the table to introduce herself and take our order.

We both ordered the french onion soup, the petit fillet and a side salad.  It seemed to take a bit longer to get our soup that what we expected.  But after that, the food arrived as expected.  The soup was really good.  The salad was just okay.  The petite fillet was prepared just as we ordered it.  However, the bacon was raw in places.  Most of it was inedible.  And we didn't receive any bread until we were about half way through with the entrees.  Should have brought it with the salad.

While the waitress was very pleasant and very nice, she seemed a bit rehearsed.  Not very natural.  She seemed a bit tense rather than being herself.  

We were there on military veteran 50% off day.  We both also had food vouchers.  When our checks arrived, we presented our food vouchers and our military DD214 forms.  They were accepted without any hassle.  But when we were about to leave, the server came to our table and said there was still a balance owed.  We knew this was incorrect since the voucher plus the military discount more than covered the cost of the meal.  When I looked at the receipt, the server had only applied the discount to the entree rather than the entire meal.  I pointed this out and the server immediately became defensive.  She insisted she had applied the discount correctly.  Simple math would have helped her had she taken the time to review what I was trying to show her.  Instead she walked away and finally another server came over and the two of them went back to the register.  Turns out, she had not applied the discount to the entire meal.  While she did apologize repeatedly after she discovered her error, she should not have developed an attitude in the first place.  Had she just looked at the receipt she should have immediately seen her error.

The issue with the wait time, the lack of bread being served at the appropriate time and the attitude of the server were the only negatives.  The food was very good.  I would definitely recommend this place.  I would also recommend the restaurant teach their servers basic math."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Horrible food. Pear salad was salty with limp lettuce. House salad also had limp lettuce. Complimentary bread was hard. Disappointing"}
{"text":"Have eaten there about 5 times now and it's always been great.. very friendly service and amazing food. The bacon wrapped filet is excellent and usually what I order. Haven't tried any desserts yet as I'm always too full. I've never seen it really busy so I would say a reservation isn't necessary unless there's going to be a big event at the casino on a weekend."}
{"text":"Great decor, fun staff food is good i love being able to see an open kitchen to see what is going on, if your ever at the jack check them out. Small menu selection but good choices."}
{"text":"Serviceable food for a casino. Kind of like airport food in these parts. Pay a lot and don't set your expectations too high and you'll be fine.

Payouts on the slots? That's a whole other story. I've walked out of the casino way up, and way down. Today, they beat me. Better luck next time, right?"}
{"text":"I agree totally with the previous reviewer in that we've also been there twice and have enjoyed the service and the food without question. My wife had the bourbon salmon and she said it was excellent and I opted for the 18 oz bone in ribeye cooked medium rare and it was perfect. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I Love their apple rub chicken shits amazing. Customer service is great. Food is amazing. Its a great price for what you're getting. Plus its in the casino(racino) cant beat that"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here while we were at Thistledown for the Kentucky Derby festivities.  We opted to just have a few appetizers instead of a full sit down meal.  Here we go....

Crab Cakes- tasty but nothing special, I was a little disappointed.

Lobster Fondue French Fries- interesting menu item. Crispy fries, tasty sauce and good amount of lobster meat.  Eat it while it's still hot though, sauce started to thicken as it cooled.  But worth the $$

Short Rib Tacos- my favorite of the three! Three nice sized tacos loaded with flavor. Definitely worth the $$!

Servers were very freindly and attentive.  Didn't mind that we came in with a drink purchased elsewhere in the Racino.  In my opinion the best food option at Thistledown."}
{"text":"Worst food ever.  My fish tacos were ice cold.  Manager was so unsympathetic. And said that he doesn't eat fish tacos and doesn't know if they should be cold.  What?!!   That's insane!!  You are the manager of a restaurant and you don't know how the food is supposed to come out?!? Crazy time.  I'm in the twilight zone."}
{"text":"The food here was alright and the service was sub-par at best. I had to keep continuously signaling the waitress to come to our table ( I was there roughly between 2-3 o'clock so there weren't people). The Tycoon Typhoon drink was great though and that's what's causing my 3 star rating. Oh yea and their presentation of the food was wonderful! I waited roughly 45 minutes for our entrees and appetizers which was frustrating"}
{"text":"I tried to find a reason not to give 5 star review but this is our second time here and it is outstanding. The food the wait staff are all top shelf++. My wife had the fillet and ordered it medium well they did a perfect job and did not even ask to butterfly it.  The appetizer,dinner and dessert all fantastic."}
{"text":"Was there tonight it was very busy but the service was fantastic and the food was really good. Very nice atmosphere everyone there was so friendly. My wife had the grilled chicken it was great. I had a steak and it was cooked perfectly. I definitely would eat there again. I want to try the pasta place in the casino it looked and smelled great. They where cooking everything to order all kinds pastas different sauces. Also had sandwiches and great looking pizza"}
