{"text":"Went to the \"Dog\" for lunch on Sunday at 12pm. The place is supposed to open 11am but it was closed. Seems the Bartender was 1 1/2hrs late. Not first time this has happened. The clock even turned back an hour last night. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Good location, close to street cars/buses.  Interior was  recently renovated and is very nice, high ceilings make the space feel bigger.  Our server was friendly & competent. The food however is just average.  I had  a small Greek salad, not that  small, lots of feta but way too much oil/vinegar, the salad was swimming in it;  needs more olives/tomato. My partner had Teriaki chicken wings, good size but not very Teriaki'd.  Good place for a beer ($5 a pint) ; the food needs attention."}
{"text":"The waitress /service was fine.  The fish was ok. The fries were definitely refried and overdone. Unfortunately the food has gone down hill since it's opening."}
{"text":"Amazing what they've done with this space. Nice neighbourhood joint with super friendly staff and great full featured menus."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and weren't that surprised that we were only one of two tables in the place, given the neighborhood is known more for its Indian cuisine and not pub fare. After our experience we can see that there are other reasons for empty seats at the Two Headed Dog, other than location. Our server was pleasant, but clearly lacking service experience. Not a great sign when your boyfriend has to go to the bar for his own drink... (I should mention that we were now the only patrons.) Our food came forty minutes after ordering. A poutine boasting of real curds on the menu arrived in a bowl soaking in watered down gravy and what appeared to be shredded marble. My boyfriend's burger arrived missing ingredients, and although rectified promptly, hardly made up for the stale bun, mealy tomatoes, and filmy mayonnaise. Towards the end of the meal our server finally came over to ask how it was. With disappointment in our eyes we suggested it was \"alright,\" to which she responded with an obligatory \"Great!\" clearly taking no notice that we found the meal far from great. Never were we asked if we would like another drink, which would have been nice, given the only redeeming quality of the Two Headed Dog was its fresh beer. I imagine with service and food such as this that their one saving grace will soon be going stale in unused kegs."}
{"text":"Nice interior/exterior. Cheap drinks. Need to shrink menu. Need to define what they are trying to be. Inconsistent art work (but it's nice). Great light fixtures. Great skull with horns. Turn down the volume on the sports game and play some music. Can't wait to get a fresh 5 dollar pbr at your patio once the garage door opens.  Loving seeing it busy.  Hope it survives. Go give it a try - get some cheap drinks! I love a 5 dollar pint.  5 dollar pibbbbbbeeeeerrrrssass!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything about this place. Excellent staff. Taren was our barkeep and waitstaff. Very personable and real!!  I like that.  It's nice to see something new in the hood.  Typical bar decor. Kinda British with an open lofty feel.  Flat screens to be seen from all seating.  Garage door in front and back. Lots of natural lighting.  Family friendly in when we were there. Comfy booths.   The order :  Calamari with dip,  calamari fresh breaded in a spicy concoction. Dip was sweet Chili heat, the Asian brand. $11.99  Thai chicken red curry.  Great spice coconutty.  Lots of veggies wonderful $14.99 (the cooks Sri Lakan,  does a Sri Lankan curry very spicy. Will try next time. And a butter chicken. ).     Blue cheese burger, excellent homemade. No filler. Good spice with fries. (Dh like fries I would have got salad ) $12.99  I saw eggs Bene coming out of kitchen with salad and fruit. That looked awesome. Will get that next time.   6 pints !  We got Canadian. We're old lol. But they have the craft beers that hipsters so crave.   $73 plus $15 tip.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Make sure to look at your change very carefully after the bill, waitress/waiter short change people on purpose."}
{"text":"I'm one of two customers sitting in the pub. The only waitress/bartender has now been making a personal phone call outside for the last five minutes. She has taken away my plate, etc, but has not brought the bill.  It's been about 15 minutes. Now I'm so curious about how long it'll last that I'm gonna continue to say nothing. The food's okay.  Edit: So it's been another 15 minutes since I initially posted.  Just to make it clear, there is absolutely nothing on the table in front of me."}
{"text":"The Two Headed Dog has been opened for a few weeks now & seem to have worked out most of the kinks. The staff were attentive & friendly. The food was standard pub fair, we had the bangers & mash. It was really good & the gravy was yummy. If they had more imports on tap instead of the standard Canadian,  Coors etc. they would be perfect."}
{"text":"So, a brand new pub in the 'hood, this one is farther East then most of the recent openings, right in the middle of the unfortunately diminishing Little India area, just a little bit west of Coxwell.  Surprisingly large, with promises of being a good summer place, garage door at the street and another at the back opening on what will hopefully be a patio, at least that's what the staff is saying tonight, right now its a parking pad, but then it is February as well...  Typical pub menu with all of the usual suspects available, a couple of tributes to the area; butter chicken, spicy Sri Lankan curry and a red coconut curry, your choice of proteins to go with...  Decent selection of craft beers on tap (10 taps) and the usual cans and bottles, currently enjoying the Left Field Oatmeal Stout. Small selection of wines but a reasonably complete array of spirits so most should find something to quaff..  Split the sandwich special, voodoo chicken today and the butter chicken, both where quite good and the naan that came with butter chicken was on par with the other Indian resto's in the area, so yea addictive...  For those that must always be connected (how else would we use Yelp after all) there is complimentary wireless, (not open, just ask staff for password).  For a soft open, everything went very well, can't wait to stumble home once the patio opens when summer returns..."}
{"text":"The servers are so friendly and real. They remember us every time we come by even if a couple months have gone by. Love coming here with my little guy and husband. Excellent $7 specials before 6. The Mac and cheese is incredible."}
{"text":"Imagine walking into a pub, sitting down and watch a bartender serve the people at the bar. Then a couple walk in and get their menus and also get waited on. While I had to walk up to the bar, ask for serve and was told that she did not see me. When I'm wearing a bright red Blue Jays shirt. Poor excuse for serve I did like going to this place but now I'm having second thoughts. Sad when places because settled in their ways. Hopefully the food makes up for this very poor showing. Return visits are definitely in question."}
{"text":"Visited the two headed dog a week ago with friends.  Very excited that there is now another place to hang out in my area.  Our table ordered wings, chicken club sandwich and the burger. The chicken club sandwich was to have avocado however it was missing from my order.  I asked the server about it and she was not familiar with all the ingredients in the sandwich but did not charge for it which I greatly appreciated,  My friend had the burger according to her it was great however the bun was a bit stale.  I spoke to the manager in passing and asked him why the place was so bright.  I told him that in my opinion it should be a bit darker and he agreed and proceeded to dim the lights at bit.  Overall the experience was good and I will check it out again.  I remain however very faithful to the Ault Spot on the Danforth."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gone to this pub a total of three times. Every time, the food has been below average but we come back to watch basketball games, have a drink and give their food another try. This pub is very convenient for us because it's close to where we live. Unfortunately, on our third time there, we had an extremely bad experience.   When we first arrived to the pub, we asked the waitress if we could have a booth with a TV where the basketball game was playing. She told us there was a booth available at the very back of the restaurant with the basketball game on which we were happy to sit at. The pub was not packed on a Saturday night and there were about three other booths available and many free seating at the front. After being seated and our drinks ordered, we waited for about 10-15 minutes before the waitress came around again and asked us if we wanted a food menu. Typically, that should be the first thing to ask your patrons. Once the food arrived, we were not satisfied with the food but we already expected it to be below average but we were happy to have a drink and watch the basketball game. A while later a group of four people came around our area and decided to sit on the high tables across from us. We assumed that they wanted to watch the basketball game as well since we were seated at the very back while there were many free seating with multiple TVs playing the UFC fight. After a few minutes, our waitress came around and changed the channel without mentioning to us that she would or even acknowledging the fact that we were watching the basketball game. I would understand it if it was another waitress that changed the channel but we specifically asked our waitress when we walked into the pub that we wanted to watch the basketball game and that our dedicated TV at our booth was too dim and wanted the screen to be brighter. She had full knowledge that we were there to watch the basketball game and that we wanted to be seated where we could watch the game.   Generally, we would let it pass and not make a big deal about it but the lack of acknowledgement and attempt to try and accommodate both groups of customers and make everyone happy was unacceptable. Our waitress did not attempt to tell the other group or even make the suggestion to ask them if they wanted to be seated elsewhere where multiple TVs were playing the UFC fight. When we confronted the waitress, she said the owner wanted to only show the UFC fight since it is an important fight which we would understand but there was another TV playing the basketball game at the front. We pointed it out to her and she said it's because the customer wanted to watch it... Here's a thought, are we not paying customers?  It is safe to say that WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS PUB no matter how close and convenient it is for us. Two Headed Dog just lost two customers who were able to overlook the bad food. It's time to train your staff on some customer services best practices.   Save your time people and head elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was there here for  lunch on Saturday by myself. Only 3 people in the place. The only staff member  in the  front of the place was polite yet not too with it. He asked me what I wanted and I said a beer and the menu. He brought the beer and no menu and proceed to eat his lunch. I waited politely  to get  a menu and asked again for one. He said he forgot, 3 CUSTOMERS! I ordered the pierogis and waited 20 minutes. The place is a sham! The pierogis we hard and dry. I remarked to him about the poor quality and he sluffed it off In addition the cook made a racket in the kitchen cutting fries..  I will never go to this place again and tell all my friends how poor it is.;No wonder there were no customers."}
{"text":"Nice place to catch a game - it's pretty narrow for a sports bar, but lots of TVs.  They do sports bar pretty good - friendly servers and good bar snacks - but they lose a star for an underwhelming, overdone burger.    The burger is my litmus test, like a martini with a bartender.  When a chef can't pull one off, I stick to beer."}
{"text":"With ice cold beer and an offering of half price wings we were off to a good start.  The bar tender was very attentive and offered to replenish our beverages when we were running low and that was pretty much about all this place had to offer.  We were optimistic and really wanted to like this place but the food was just sub par. We ordered natchos with beef and those 1/2 price wings. Firstly the food took a long while to come out. When it it finally did the wings were dry, cold and tasteless while the natchos were completely void of flavour. The beef on the natchos was not seasoned at all and the establishment provided a super small side of canned salsa to try to help improve the flavour.  Over all I think we unanimously agreed that if we ever do come back to the two headed dog it will be for Beer and people watching only!"}
{"text":"Worst staff and service anytime of day or night.  Waitresses have gone and slept in a booth while customers are present.  Often it takes 10 minutes to get a drink.  Hope this place closes, and something in the neighbourhood rises from the ashes."}
{"text":"Great place, great beers on tap, can't wait for the patio in the back to open. Waitresses are nice and they play the Jays game and raptors games. Family friendly for dinner too. Dishes are well cheesed up"}
{"text":"The wait staff is really friendly and attentive, and the wings are pretty good, but the fries left a lot to be desired (cold and tasted like they were kept warm under a heat-lamp for quite some time). Good price for Guinness ($6) and Steamwhistle ($5). The sweet potato fries were really delicious, but a bit pricey. The butter chicken poutine sauce is really flavourful but they need to get the fries situation fixed for it to be a homerun."}
{"text":"I'm going to post a 5 star review of this place but I will definitely say that this is with a caveat; you must come on a day when a good server is working. I know this seems like really bad advice, and I wish I could tell you what days the best servers are, but I just don't know. They seem to switch off at random a lot of the time (have had really great service on Wednesdays lol). I have been here with really bad servers and it was terrible, but employees change from time to time so I don't like rating based on servers. Anyway, here is my review IF you get a good server:  This is one of those comfortable places that one would go to when wandering on Gerrard and looking for a place with a familiar feel. Something easy and not too expensive, somewhere to watch some sports and grab a pint, etc. There aren't many like it in the immediate area and for me that's a plus.   When you walk in you immediately feel like you know what kind of place it is. You could argue it's a little too narrow for a sport's bar but I thought there was plenty of space and I think they make up for it with a long bar at the front and plenty of TVs lining the entire place. It's the familiar feel of a relaxing sports bar. And the food is the same.   They have a decent selection on the menu. Maybe not the most extensive choices, but I respect a place that has a small menu but does it well. I've gotten the burger a bunch of times and it's been satisfying every single time. Tried the wings recently and can't say I was disappointed. And the fries ... well, as far as I'm concerned they are to die for.   They almost always have a lunch special from about 1-6 pm where you can get many of their menu items for half price or close to it. And almost every food special has a drink special to go with it and that is always a welcome sight. Service was fast and friendly even during busy times and I never felt ignored.   All in all, a wonderful, clean, welcoming place that can't be matched by any close by. Will be coming here often."}
{"text":"1/2 price wings have become my Sunday staple. The beer selection is fairly standard. Very nice open atmosphere with fantastic mounted TVs. Staff is laid back, and very friendly."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst places I've ever been in terms of service.  We were told to seat ourselves wherever we wanted and so we did - and it took the server about 10 minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink. After asking what was on tap, we asked what some of the prices were, and she said she needed to check, left and came back about 5 minutes later. It was ridiculous how long we had to wait for one beer when the restaurant was not even half empty. She came back to check up on us to see if our beer was ok after we had finished our first round. The bar was still half empty. The waitress we had seemed like she didn't care much about our order or that she was working there at all and was quite spacy. When we finally asked for our bill (which took another quite a bit) she gave it to us with the machine. It was only as we paid that she smiled and told us that they were short staffed and how she was \"running around\" trying to serve everyone. But it was only when we were paying the bill that she decided to be nice and have converstation with us.   The prices were fairly standard for bars in the area, a pound of wings was $13, but it was hard to find anything cheap. I heard that they had half priced wings, but when we asked, the server said that they didn't have anything like that so I'm not sure if there really were anything like that.  We wanted to order something, but with the service so bad and slow, we decided that it just wasn't worth the time to wait.   The bar itself is in a good location, close to streetcars/buses and other foods that you need. The place was much bigger than I thought with a wide back and a basement (with the washroom) that had a billiards table. There are TVs everywhere and they were playing various sports games. However, the art was a bit creepy - they had old portrait paintings that were kind of creepy.   All in all, the bar itself is nice, has a great draft selection (though has weird prices, our Steamwhisles were 6.19) but horrible service."}
