{"text":"Food wasn't horrible, I would however expect it to be better considering we are in Arizona not the Midwest. The service was horrible. We were never greeted, girl taking out order was extremely rude, when asked how her night night was we were ignored and received an eye roll in return. She even sat down with her friends at a table and proceeded to shout profanities so that the whole restaurant could hear. I will NOT be coming back due to the lack of respect employed show towards their patrons."}
{"text":"My brother and I went to Fuzzy's 8/19/2012, after searching the Mill Ave. area for somewhere to eat lunch. I loved the atmosphere food, and most importantly, the prices. Everything there is pretty much under $10 My brother ordered the Tempura Shrimp burrito, and he said it was the best he ever had! I had the grilled shredded beef sandwich, and it was delish."}
{"text":"Love Fuzzy's!  I always get the chicken nachos w/ feta, garlic sauce, white queso and it's super yummy!  Prices are reasonable and they now deliver!  Great place for take out, eat in, drinks, etc.  Go for Taco Tuesdays as well!"}
{"text":"I will start by stating that I love the spicy pork nachos. They are delicious. I have eaten at the restaurant and gotten take out a few times, with nothing particularly notable (although my husband says his food it's always cold, I guess I'm less picky about that). Then, tonight, things took a turn for the worse... I picked up my take out and got home to unpack it, only to realize that they didn't give me the queso and put the wrong kind of meat on my nachos. Since I only live about five minutes away I called and informed the employee who answered that I did not get my queso and that there was the wrong kind of meat on my nachos. She asks me to bring it in so I can show her.  So I tell her sure, but I'd like to get an order for the correct nachos started, to which she hesitantly agreed.  When I arrive, I get no apology, but an accusation that I didn't understand that the queso comes in a separate bowl and questioning about the kind of meat. Then she proceedes to show the cook, just to make sure I'm not wrong about the meat, which is irrelevant, because I am not taking soggy chips with cold meat home just because they didn't give me the queso and I had to drive back to get the food that I'd already paid for.  I don't even mind that they forgot the queso because mistakes happen, but to forget the queso, put the wrong meat on my nachos AND be completely unapologetic about it after I had to drive back is completely infuriating.  So if you like cold food to go, please check your food before you leave the establishment so that you, too, will not suffer the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh tacos made to order. Feed family of 3 for under $20!  Chips and queso was excellent!  I had the taco platter, hubby loved the shredded beef. $2.25 for an 18 oz glass of Landshark!  Will be here often :)"}
{"text":"Service was great. The cashier also worked as the waiter, food runner, and busboy he worked hard and had a great personality. I ordered the chicken nachos and the new seasonal chicken salad. The salad was served in a stainless steel mixing bowl. It was cold, fresh and very good. The chicken nachos were decent, the portions were huge and the prices are cheap most items were $2-8. This is a Mexican/American fast food causal dinning restaurant. Menu has tacos, burritos, nachos, and salads. Easy to order, they have a huge menu on the wall. You can choose to go orders or seat yourself either inside or outside. The inside self dinning area was good size, the floors and tables were all clean and the huge windows makes the area fell very open.   If you are looking for a fast meal in a clean restaurant under $10 this is a good option."}
{"text":"The tempura fish burrito with queso on top was crazy delicious.  I'm sure it was five thousand calories but I just don't care, I walked from my apartment - stop judging me!   But really, all of the ingredients were really tasty, I hope this place sticks around its a really nice addition to mill."}
{"text":"This is the first AZ location for this chain and it just opened a couple of days ago. Unfortunately, I'm left with mixed impressions about my first experience here.  It's a casual restaurant where you order at the front and then you can either eat inside or get it to-go. I went the to-go route and ordered their taco plate. Prices are pretty good, with the taco plate running around $7 for 2 tacos and your choice of 2 sides. I got the grilled fish taco and grilled shrimp taco, both in the soft option (which means you get a soft corn tortilla). For my sides I got their rice and black beans.  First off, the tacos were good. They're unique in that they use feta cheese which adds a nice saltiness. The shrimp taco was my favorite of the two -the shrimp were seasoned nicely and weren't overcooked.  Where they missed the mark though was on the sides. The rice was undercooked to the point where some of it was still hard, which completely distracted from any decent flavor it had. The beans were good flavor wise, just watery, which I don't love... but this would have still been ok except for the fact that I found a hair in my beans :(  Their hot sauce is good though and was a nice surprise. I would have loved it on my rice if the rice wasn't undercooked. The hot sauce has a tangy, almost-buffalo style quality to it, with just the right amount of heat.  Since this is only their first week being open though, I would be willing to go back and give it another try and hopefully some of the issues will have been worked out."}
{"text":"I think Fuzzy's is intended to be Tex Mex fast food.  If that is its intent, it scores!  The food is very fresh and tasty. It is not bland at all.  i guess yo can order it bland, if you like.  They may not have what some would think is a huge menu, but it is quite varied and includes a few breakfast entrees served all day.  I am not a quesadilla lover.  But Fuzzy's has got me rethinking that. We were there last week and my son wanted a chicken quesadilla. He could not finish it so I had a piece.  It was very good.  Loads of well seasoned shredded chicken and cheese.  Really good.   My brother always gets one of their entree salads--tempura fish--I think. It is huge and comes in a big stainless steel bowl and is very reasonably priced.  My wife is a huge fan of their black bean soup.  Also, the service and people are always nice and the restaurant is clean. We go there often with our kids and they are made to feel right at home.  They serve beer and margaritas and I find those prices extremely reasonable.  I understand they have a Wednesday margarita night with special pricing that is quite a deal.  If you want Tex Mex quick but hate the TB (like me), Fuzzy's is where to go! The only downside is that they don't have tamales (yet) on the menu. But there's plenty of other items to keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Wow, interesting reviews. I had a great experience at Fuzzy's. Met a bunch of my friends there Saturday around 11AM or so before we  headed to the Badger game.   There were about 15 people there and we did not  have any service issues.   In fact, they kept our beer glasses full. :).  The girls really liked a drink called a Fuzzy Driver (or something like that).     I had been to Fuzzy's before so I knew what to expect but was interested to see my Foodie friend's reactions.  They  thought the food was rock solid.   Great tasting, good variety, and great prices.   Just as I thought -  everyone really liked the fish tacos with feta (yum - writing this makes me want one right now).   Burritos were raved about as well.  Fuzzy's is winning me over.   Again- if you are looking for a high end meal - this is not your place.   If you are looking for really good fresh food at really good prices - this is your place.      Damn- now I really want a taco.... Mouth is watering...."}
{"text":"We have dined here many times and love the food.  Yesterday we had dinner there.  The temperature was 60 degrees in the place.  Kept my coat on and my fingers were cold.  Our food was also instantly cold.  When we left after asking to raise the heat it was 62.  Was very disappointed and will be a while before we can return."}
{"text":"Customer service was exemplary. it was my birthday so they gave me a discount and a free tequila shot. Good beer selection and pretty decent burrito. I had the chicken and would recommend it.  Also really good drink specials and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food try the fajita chicken. Employees are outstanding. Great selection of drinks and great prices"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewer.  This place is not worth the money.  We placed an order for pork, chicken, fish and beef tacos.  We couldn't tell what any of them were except for the fish...scary!  Everything was bland and I recall thinking that taco bell would have been a better choice than this.  I would recommend any taco place in Madison other than this.  The ground beef taco actually looked like a mushy cat food and honestly didn't taste much better.  The owner was very nice and came to our table but also made it uncomfortable for us.  He kept asking how everything was and I was pretty honest with him."}
{"text":"Amazing vibe and food is fantastic! Enchiladas are my favourite."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best (yes I know it's mill avenue). Waited 20 min for 2 tacos and a quesadilla and the place was empty. There was enough lettuce on the taco to make a salad. And you have to pay extra for salsa...?"}
{"text":"This place it's great and the food it's so good as usual but the cashier Laurene had an attitude like she didn't  wanted  to be there we have people who will  Iove to have her job and do it with a better attitude and better customer service."}
{"text":"This is our go to place when press for time. Fast service and good food! We got in and out in under 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is very near my work, and I enjoy their food.   However, the service is another story. While their food consistency remain high. The service consistency is a crap shoot at best. I don't eat feta. It comes on all of their tacos and salads, so I always ask for \"no feta\". They get this simple request right about 60% of the time. Even though the order receipt clearly shows what I asked for. Kitchen staff clearly do not read each order as it comes through the system, instead focusing on the big picture, and missing the little details, like \"NO EFFING FETA\".  The other problem I frequently run into is the single cashier, which causes long lines. As long as things are moving forward, I'm fine with waiting a little longer. However, their demeanor is sometimes a little too friendly, encouraging conversations that slow the entire process down by 2-3 times. They have 2 registers at the front. I've seen them both used maybe once in my 12 or so visits.   If they could improve order accuracy, and speed at the register, I'd gladly  go 4 or 5 stars on this place. Yes, the tacos are that good (sans feta)."}
{"text":"Ummmm!  HELL YEAH!!  I eat here almost every Tuesday for Taco tuesday, when the tacos are $1.50.  Its freaking delicious.  There is two types of cheese on the tacos, and it goes faaaaar!  I LOVE the tempura fish tacos, and any of the pork tacos, but the beef and chicken werent too impressive.  I also had the crawdad one, pretty yummy. I like the tex mex rice better than the cilantro one, both the refried beans and the black beans are good, not super fanastic, but not gross. The nachos are GIANT.  They will feed two people, and they are very generous with their toppings.  Lots of meat.  :)  ONE bad thing, why the heck are the beer glasses so damn HUGE and heavy!  Its hard to hold comfortably. I think they are the glasses for margaritas, and i get that its prolly easier/cheaper  to have a one size fits all glass, but damn.  Not a deal breaker though.  I WILL be back."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place 3 times now. Its very cute and clean inside. The staff was really friendly as well. The prices are great.As far as the food goes it depends.  I had taco plate the 1st time I came, i really enjoyed the brisket, great flavor!..but chicken one was bland. The refried beans were really tasty, but the rice was cold in temperature and underwelming. The 2nd visit i had the $1.00 ground beef tacos on Tuesday. Major disappointment. Barely had any meat or lettuce in them and some sort of weird tasting sauce at the bottom, unless it was lard or something. Really gross. My 3rd visit I chose breakfast. Smart idea! I ordered chilaquiles and a cheese quesadilla. Delicious! It was the biggest of portions Ive ordered here, amd the tastiest. Id return for just that meal alone. I hope they take their reviews into consideration, because this place has the potential to be excellent."}
{"text":"I was skeptical because the first person to review was admittedly a friend of the owner, so I didn't give that too much credence, but after having a combo plate and a beer I'm a big fan.  The staff was very friendly, the food was delicious, and the price was reasonable.  I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Great place yo eat with great atmosphere !!!   We love it here !! Makes us feel young!!!"}
{"text":"Homemade tacos taste better than these. I ordered a fish taco and they put shrimp instead. The food was cold additionally. Would not come back or recommend for tacos."}
{"text":"Never order takeout on the phone! Great spot for cheap tacos. And the new California heat taco is out if control! Great eats and deals everyday of the week!"}
{"text":"I've ordered catering this past weekend for the 4th of July and I was extremely pleased with everything. I especially want to thank Christopher and James for their excellent customer service. Everything we ordered was delicious, from the tacos to the salsa!!! I highly recommend Fuzzy Taco's Shop for catering and just plain for the fantastic food!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is very cool....they make sure you have what you need, it is a self serve restaurant, and are willing to help you out.   Decent street style tacos. My fave are the fajita chicken and the brisket tacos  covered with (not really ) butt burning sauce. Nachos are ok but im not a fan of the cheese. Their salads are no joke sized and flavorful but my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE item they got...lilikoi margarita, on Tha rocks  During the cooler months I'll  sit outside, sip this and think of HI. Always puts a smile on my face"}
{"text":"1st time here and we loved it! Great portion to $$ ratio! Their nachos and quesadilla's are delicious!! And for desert an Oreo churro. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Jumbo burrito? Please that is the sorriest burrito I have ever seen/eaten. The burrito supremes from Taco Bell are bigger and better quality. If they called the burrito \"baby burrito\" I would have given them 2 stars for their honesty."}
{"text":"My go to spot in college. Great prices for great food. Margaritas are great as well. Visit it every time I'm in town"}
{"text":"My friends and I have wondered why this place was called Fuzzy's ever since we were freshman at ASU four years ago. When we celebrated graduation on Mill Ave, we came to the conclusion that it is because everything is a little fuzzy when you end up here at the end of a night of drinking. The beeritas are bomb and the Americanized Mexican food hits the spot- decent place for quick eats."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable price.  The inside made me feel comfortable in a tee-shirt.  Great place to eat for casual lunch."}
{"text":"Good food, but takes forever.   And BEWARE, they put extra charges on your check which aren't advertised on the menu board. If you don't find it, they won't tell you about it!   Check your receipt for sure!  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"It's just OK. Size of tacos is small and meat inside almost non-existent.  You end up eating lettuce. Way over priced."}
{"text":"Everything you could want in a Tex Mex joint while enjoying a night out. I kept it simple the only couple of times I've been there but the food was good both times. Good tacos and yummy sides. They also have great deals for taco Tuesday. Nice sized margaritas. Looking forward to trying out more food and drinks next time we go"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Love the nachos! Tacos taste so good and my husband loves all the brisket dishes! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm going back because the chips & queso was truly fantastic. The crispy and soft shell tacos are pretty tasty with a lot of meat and fresh cilantro and other stuff on top. If you have 5 bucks you can get 2 tacos and they're pretty filling."}
{"text":"Drove by couple of hours ago. Place is closed for business. Signs are all gone, outside furniture gone."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Fuzzy's Taco shop. I ordered the special ground beef tacos. I really enjoyed the way they were seasoned and how fresh the tomatoes and herbs tasted on the taco. The atmosphere was great too. The staff was super friendly and they had great beer specials....$2 for a beer isn't bad at all. Cheap good food and cheap beer makes a great place to hangout and pregame before the game. Really enjoyed it thank you Fuzzy's."}
{"text":"Very plain food and small portions . The tray she put my food on was dirty as well as the whole restaurant . The food wasn't even warm ...closer to cold. Serve yourself salsa out of it dirty tub. Total dive"}
{"text":"Living in Downtown Tempe for several years now, I'm always excited to see a new restaurant on the scene.  Very disappointing!  I'm a fan of great Mexican food and wasn't expecting top of the line fare being it is basically a taco shop, but this was horrible.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the place has a cool vibe, but it ends there.  I had a ground beef taco and a shredded beef taco.  Got both to go as I was walking home, but ate the ground beef taco there.  Yuck!  Almost went to get my money back, but they all seemed so happy about the opening I just didn't have the heart, and I figured maybe the shredded beef would be better.  WRONG.  I took a few bites as I walked down Mill and found the nearest trash can to dispose of the rest.  This is hands down the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted, and just may be one of the worst restaurants I have ever tried.  I feel bad for them, but there is no way they will last 6 months, obviously they don't care or just don't know good Mexican food.  I can't believe that this is a chain and there are more out there somewhere!   I would say to stay far away from this place, but it is so bad that it's almost worth a novelty to stop in and get ONE taco to share if you happen to be walking down Mill one evening.  You will see what I'm talking about, amazingly bad food, you will not believe they are charging money for it."}
{"text":"Maybe the college crowd likes sub standard food because of the lack luster drinks but for $25 this lunch was comparable to the quality of Taco Bell! Not impressed at all :("}
{"text":"Great place! We stopped in for breakfast on our way out if town. My wife loved the  real fast tacos and I really enjoyed my shrimp egg and cheese taco!"}
{"text":"Beerarita?  Um yes please!!!  The quesadilla was totally stuffed with chicken, however could have used a little more flavor.  The chips/salsa was yummy and the salsa was exactly what the quesadilla was lacking."}
{"text":"I see all these reviews with 2 and 3 stars, it's coming from the folks who are looking for authentic Mexican food, this is Tex-Mex, if you have never had Tex-Mex food and are looking for authentic Mexican food you will not like this place, this is Tex-Mex! It's different from Lindo Michoacán and not priced at $16 an entree. Great service, awesome food! Been waiting for them to open. We had Brisket Nachos, best Nachos I've had in town. 18 oz domestics in a cold schooner for $3 all day, can't beat that unless your gambling."}
{"text":"Great little taco shop. Coffee is kind of weak though. But I'll be back in the evening some time to try a margarita."}
{"text":"Yum! Fuzzy's never disappoints. Always great food, good people. I have never left here unsatisfied in any way. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I loved Fuzzy's when I lived in Dallas and I still love Fuzzy's now that I'm in Madison.   These are not your normal midwestern tacos!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I swung in after she got off work for breakfast (Yay, I hate third shift) because I have been craving a breakfast burrito. You know, fluffy egg, warm tortilla, meat, potato, the stuff I made when going through Scouting in DFW.   I ordered the chorizo, egg, cheese, and potato burrito and the GF ordered the egg, cheese, and bacon. Both were good. Not amazing, but good and it was exactly what I needed to get over that craving.  Chorizo can be a very greasy meat and I was worried that my burrito would be drippy nasty. Instead it showed up and everything was dry and quite good. The only complaint I had was that there was not a lot of meat on mine. Trade-off for it not being greasy I guess.   The bacon burrito was good but to me the bacon chunks were to big and not crispy enough.   The bad... so the bad... there was no spice in the food itself but this being the midwest I am starting to expect it everywhere I go and am surprised when that isn't the case. Their on the table hot sauce is pretty much a salty vinegary Tabasco clone with a little more smoke flavor to it.   All in all, solid breakfast for not terribly much money."}
{"text":"The food was delish and as always the service was great! I ate a chicken and grilled veggies quesadilla, hubby are chicken taco, and done ate bacon potato quesadilla. Even got a free drink. Very friendly and very good. I'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"Very good food and service but check your order before you pay for it they added a couple items we didn't order and forgot a couple we did order over all a very good experience"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews I thought I'd give this place a try. Boy was that a mistake.   The server was polite and friendly, however other than that I really would have been better off eating jack in the box tacos.  So, in a nutshell; Overpriced, cold and not how I expect a taco.   2 stars."}
{"text":"When I'm craving taco's Fuzzy's is always a top choice! I usually get chips and salsa and chicken tacos and they have always satisfied my taste buds! Every time I go in the cashier who takes your order is friendly and ready to help with any needs. They also have great happy hour and amazing beergaritas!"}
{"text":"I've been thinking about joining Yelp for a long time, and never got around to it. Eating here got me to take the plunge. The tacos are really pretty good, but the atmosphere gave me a headache. I ordered a grilled veggie taco and a grilled fish taco, both of which were decent. The tortillas themselves were bland, but the fillings were good basics and Baja-style salad toppings, and seemed balanced. My vegetables and fish were hot, tasted fresh, and the fish was well-spiced. My husband thought similarly about his beef tacos, though my grilled veggies wanted a bit more kick. Their guacamole and queso (which they gave us free when we ordered the guac, nice) were both good, too -- fresh and flavorful.  But... We were the only people there at 4 on a holiday afternoon, and about 10 minutes after we ordered, heard someone behind the counter say \"did someone start that order?\" Riiight. The decor didn't help either -- it's extremely yellow and bright, and they were playing loud Britney on the sound system. As I waited for my food, I tried to figure out whether Fuzzy's was annoying, or whether I was tired from shopping. Probably both, but I would've dwelled on it less without the long wait.  I'd say Fuzzy's is more of a taco sports bar than anything else, but the food is -- as a previous reviewer said -- decent, and definitely a good value. If you like that kind of atmosphere, Baja style tacos, and don't want to spend much, Fuzzy's is worth a shot. If you want a quiet chat or a touch more innovation, try Tex Tubb's. If you're looking for authentic Mexican, check out Guadalajara or El Pastor."}
{"text":"So so so GOOD! Whenever I go to Mill I start my night off with Fuzzys. The shrimp and fish tempura tacos are the best. I really love their beeritas as well. Very cool atmosphere and it's really not a bad price. Cheaper than Rubios. I really recommend this place to those that are looking for a cool place on Mill Ave to eat. They even deliver to World of Beer!"}
{"text":"Been here many times but this past week was disappointing.  Ordered taco combo plate with fried fish and shrimp and the fish look kinda strange, shaped more like chicken tender.  Took first bite and I noticed the meat was kinda hard and dry.  Informed guy at counter that I assumed was Manager, he had blue polo, that they might of made mistake with my order.  He tells me they don't make fried chicken tacos, well sir, I guess today you do now. Showed him my order and he said they might of over cooked it and just walked away without even apologizing or offerinvvvg to remake.  Took another bite and there was no way it was fish.  Even if you over cook fish, it will not turn hard or chewy.  I work in the food and beverage industry for over 20yrs so I would know when something like this is wrong.  Really disappointed that they made no effort to make things right.  Come on, what's the food cost on a fish taco, probably less than  $1.  And they couldn't even offer to remake one."}
{"text":"These are some super tasty tacos. The California Heat, tempura style with hard shell is my favorite, I never would have ordered that on my own. The super helpful cashier recommended it! I love the 80s music that they play too, it's just a really upbeat atmosphere with super good tacos. Their borracho beans are pretty yummy too!"}
{"text":"Great drink specials, great food, outstanding service!! all around great place to pre-game before hitting the bars on Mill Ave, what can I say it's simply GGRREEEAATT!!"}
{"text":"The food was rather expensive for a taco shop. Despite ordering a burrito with grilled vegetables and having my order verified several times, the burrito I received had shrimp in it. Not a pleasant surprise. My friend seemed to enjoy his meal, though."}
{"text":"Every time we go to this place the tacos are ice cold. Last nite my wife and I went there for date nite, and it was bittersweet.  I asked the guy to warm up the tacos and he said he couldn't take back food that's been prepared and he didn't have time to make warm ones.  I left the plate there. I went back to the register and was given a reorder which was cool.  The funny and maybe gross thing that happened later was after I had put my finger in the original taco order to see if they were warm and left it on the counter, the guy gives the order to some college kid. The nasty part is, I just had sex, before going there to eat, so this guy was eating what I had on my finger that's now in the food.  Careful what u take for free!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in due to its close proximity from the Tavern.  I ordered chips with nacho cheese and a bean burrito.  The cheese was really watery but I stuck to those instead of my bean burrito since it was FILLED with beans that tasted like they were from a can and were so thick and pasty.  I flagged down a server and asked for a glass of water in exchange so my throat would be cleared out from the beans!  The manager came over to let me know he took it off my bill and that he \"tries to steer his customers AWAY from the beans\"........... well- why don't you just STOP serving them??? tsk... tsk..... tsk.... I would have preferred Taco Bell instead!!"}
{"text":"$1.50 taco tuesdays and kids eat free 4p-7p weekdays.  Great deals.  My kid loves their nachos (huge children portions).  Worth a stop."}
{"text":"My son and I tried this place yesterday and we had the best lunch. Do you want a really great burrito get the shredded beef it was kick ass! As for my picky son he had the chicken quesadilla with black beans and onions and he said it was the best,and for a picky eater that says a lot. The prices are very reasonable and the service and people are GREAT!!! They have se really wonderful weekly specials like 1.00 Margaritas on Wednesdays and 1.00 domestic beer bottle or tap on Thursdays. Try these guys out I know you will love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the ground beef tacos and chips and queso. Love the fuzzys dust! Could've done with less lettuce & tomato but more meat & cheese. Overall good food and great prices!"}
{"text":"Local store service mainly tacos and burritos. Fresh made but not original Mexican style or flavor. Good for lunch break. Or late night snack. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"From an out of towner who loves Mexican.  This place is good, and is a total dive.  It kind of reminds me of the snack area of a 70s bowling alley, except with awesome burritos.  Service (counter and other counter, no servers) is quick, on point, and friendly.  You can't go wrong.  Imagine a Chipotle or Moe's kind of place, but better. The brisket burrito is excellent."}
{"text":"I never been to or heard of a Fuzzys Taco before but it sounded unique. Unique it was. They're definately exploring a new concept to me. Is it fast food???...kinda. Is it a dine in restaurant???... sorta. Is it a bar???. Maybe.... Is it mexican food??.. More like mexican inspired. But the place was friendly and service was good. The meal was tasty, quality ingredients and i left full. But if you want traditional mexican food...this is not the place"}
{"text":"I discovered Fuzzy's in Texas (Arlington) summer '11 after graduating college. Realizing I hadn't yet hit the proverbial jackpot that everyone speaks of after you graduate, I found my way to Fuzzy'$ Taco $hop. Sooooo good and soooooo cheap!!   You'll find their slogan, \"Welcome to Your New Addiction\"  plastered over everything! Cups, t-shirts, walls, etc., and the slogan doesn't lie! My first time trying Fuzzy's I went back twice in the same week!  I was in Scottsdale visiting a friend in spring training and we LOVE Mexican food! We popped into the Tempe location which is situated near the university and the hot spots where students hang. This location is poppin' with a bar/club (Vintage) located directly above the restaurant. Very different from the family-friendly location in Agg-Town.  If I had to guess, Fuzzy's is the booty call you LOVE to have at the end of every crazy party night! I literally close my eyes and smile when biting into their tasty tacos! There's a bar inside for all my lushies, and reasonable prices to boot!! If you're looking for attentive service this isn't the place. Just order your food, pick it up when your number is called and enjoy! We ate Fuzzy's twice that weekend since I miss out on good Mexican food in DC. Solid. Delicious. Cheap.  For about $40 bucks we got 5 shrimp tempura tacos, queso, chips, and two margs! SCORE!!!     Traveling on a budget? This is your spot if there's one in your area!  LOVE the upbeat  Tempe location!"}
{"text":"As a former Dallas-Fort Worth resident, I was ecstatic to see one of my all-time favorite restaurants come to my new home of Phoenix.  Sadly, this is not the Fuzzy's I knew and loved.  The menu and ingredients were the same, but the somehow the execution was just off.  I had my usual order with a shredded pork soft taco, shrimp tempura soft taco, and a corizo/egg/cheese breakfast taco.  The main ingredients, pork, shrimp, and chorizo and egg were as I remembered, cooked just right and very flavorful.  That's where the similarity ends, the fresh tortillas I remember were either leftovers or have been replaced with mass produced.  The toppings that should be a perfect mix of lettuce, feta, cilantro, sauce, etc. were reduced to 99% lettuce and added nothing to the tacos.  The second star is earned only for the fact that the hot sauce hasn't changed, (it's fantastic but I should have bought a bottle so I wouldn't have to go back there again) and it appeared they still serve beer in the frosted goblet (although it was lunchtime and I had to go back to work so I did not partake).  I hope this is just growing pains for the franchise and that they can bring this place up to the standards of the DFW locations."}
{"text":"The food was ok.  I love mexican food and this is bleh, edible.  The tempura fish tacos have potential but they need to allow the fish to drain after they fry them and the chicken nachos  had cold shredded chicken and a tiny bit of guac-ish sauce.  If your hungry, it will cure it, but don't expect to be wowed of have flashbacks to Puerto Vallarta deliciousness."}
{"text":"I love their fajita beef tacos.. and definitely love the special prices for tacos on Tuesdays.."}
{"text":"Worst fajita beef taco I have ever eaten. Everything in it was almost ice cold, including the fajita beef itself. Poor customer service, because noone was even interested in listening to what my complaint was about."}
{"text":"I love this taco shop. You could even say I'm a little obsessed. It's cheap (tacos being about $1.99), has a relaxed atmosphere, and the tacos are bomb.  Let me clarify a few things though: Their Baja-style tacos are killer. Each one starts with a layer of Mexican blend cheese, meat (more than 2 tbsp.), lettuce, tomatoes, and feta cheese that goes all the way to the top. This is not your 1/3 full Taco Bell taco. However; their breakfast-style tacos aren't as full. They don't have the lettuce and extra cheese like the Baja ones.  Rice has good flavor but can be crunchy depending on the day. Black beans are seasoned well, but the refried ones could use a little TLC in the kitchen.  Drunken Pig soup is better than I thought it'd be- there's a lot of meat in one little bowl. Quesadillas are huge. As in cut the moon in half and there's your quesadilla. Rarely do I see people finish a whole one. But there are those who workout 24/7 and can eat a whole whale if that were legal, so they can probably down one all by themselves. For the rest of us however, you can share it and be fine.   Out of everything I've had there, the Baja-style grilled fish, chicken, and spicy pork tacos are my favorite. I like to order two tacos and a side of rice which usually keeps me full for the rest of the night. It's a definitely a place to go to if you're looking for good, cheap Mexican."}
{"text":"Very good food! I had the grilled veggie tacos (hard shell). Didn't have to wait in line to place my order for very long. We sat on the patio ate and people watched. I'd recommend as a good chill spot for good and very reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stats I would. The food was horrible. I had a jumbo burrito, tempura shrimp to be exact, a grilled fish taco, and guacamole n chips. I had a shock top which wasn't very cold but probably the best tasting thing I had there. The burrito was filled with beans, rice and lettuce, it's supposed to be a shrimp burrito and there were 5 SHRIMPS (keep in mind it was a jumbo burrito)!! I was so disappointed that I didn't eat any of it after a few bits. Someone that worked there asked how everything was tasting and I said well not very good, she answered and said \"well is the shock top good at least?\" And I said yeah probably the best thing here. And she walked away so carelessly. That shows you how they could careless about the food they provide.   Don't waste your money, time or appetite just so be Unsatisfied to say the least!"}
{"text":"Poor flavor, long wait time, and decorated to give you seizures!  Everything you could want in a restaurant."}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich was soooo good! I loved that they had a flavored tea that wasn't sweetened."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get texmex in town. There are places to go that serve al pastor, this is where you go to get a brisket burrito."}
{"text":"The chicken enchilada plate was great! Simple & eclectic place with a laid back feel. Prices are more than fast food but less than a restaurant. $6.99 for the 2 enchiladas with 2 sides."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos! Ordered 3 Tempura Tacos and Borracho Beans --- See pic I uploaded.  BF had the burrito, which wasn't tightly wrapped and fell apart.  The wait for food took about 20 minutes with not many ppl in the restaurant. I'll return because the food was delicious, but only if I don't have plans soon afterwards."}
{"text":"Well ... I'm on the fence ... The food was good .. However not hot ... Took approximately 15 minutes to get meal and they were not busy at all ... Floors were dirty but someone came out to sweep shortly after we sat ... Chips and queso BOMB !! .. Brisket nachos good generous portion but the meat was barely warm ... The black beans are different almost in a broth type soup and were good ... Would I go back ??? Yes ... Would I crave it like other restaurants ... Not likely after this initial visit .. Clean up a little and heat the food up better and it may swing a 4 or 5 star review ... However today 3 it is"}
{"text":"Because this location is new so me and girlfriend decided to give it a shot. We've been wanting to try this place out but man was I disappointed.... I ordered shredded brisket and spicy pork taco and my girlfriend ordered the veggie enchilada with veggie taco NO CHEESE. Once the food came out, the first thing me and my girlfriend noticed was that the taco had CHEESE on them, then I looked at the receipt to see if the cashier forgot to put no cheese on the taco but no, it said NO FETA on the receipt, so clearly the cooks didn't pay attention to what was on their screen. And then there's my tacos.... Man it was probably the worst taco I've had in awhile, first the tortilla was cold AF, it felt like it just came out of the fridge. And then the rest of the food tasted like room temperature. Overall because this place is fairly new so I'll give it another chance couple months from now."}
{"text":"These are among some of the best tacos I've had in a while.  I ordered the grilled fish tacos, and I found them very delicious.   I went at 3 pm on a Tuesday, and I've only gone once, so I'm not sure if the food quality is different at different times.  I'll have to go again and find out.  Atmosphere was very College-esque, brightly colored and surprisingly quiet.  My food was ready moderately fast and of course the prices were excellent.    My one qualm, however, would have to be the hard seating.  It wasn't comfortable sitting for more than 10 minutes in that booth, and I constantly had to move around to keep my butt from complaining.  Overall: good..inexpensive food, decent atmosphere...needs better seating.  I would go here again."}
{"text":"All of these good reviews must be from employees or friends of the owner because Fuzzy's is absolutely horrible. Here is a recap of my three visits:  Visit #1: Counter staff was friendly but not very knowledgeable about the menu. I asked one person what kind of fish was in the fish taco and he said it was tempura. I told him that tempura was not a type of fish and the other person told me it was Alaskan Polack (I think she meant pollack). I then asked them if they had tried all of the tacos, looking for a recommendation. The first guy told me that he had tried all of the meat tacos, because he is a \"meat guy\". So I asked which was his favorite, to which he replied, \"definitely the shrimp\". I had one chicken taco and one pork taco and they were just o.k. The feta cheese was kind of weird on a taco, it just made it salty and the sauce tasted like sweetened Tabasco.  Visit #2:  Ordered the tempura fish taco and the grilled shrimp taco. The coating on the fish was not tempura but more like some kind of breading and it was over cooked to the point of being fish jerky. The shrimp tacos took them three attempts to make correctly; the first one was not prepared as ordered, the second one was dropped on the floor and the third one was finally prepared right but was extremely salty. That's the problem when you have college kids accustomed to eating ramen and Kraft macaroni and cheese cooking at a restaurant, they are so used to consuming large quantities of sodium that they tend to over salt everything.  Visit #3:  Since this is a new restaurant, I decided to give them one last chance to get it right.  I ordered two pork tacos and the filling in both was cold. Strike three. These people really need to get out of the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is a great spot to grab a few drinks and some delicious tacos. Every week they've got Taco Tuesday and the tacos are only $1.50, combo that with happy hour (4-7PM) and you've got similarly cheap drank."}
{"text":"Where to start...? We were very excited to try Fuzzy's since it recently opened up near our home. Two of us got the combo plates, our kids got the chicken strips and potatoes while I went with the brisket burrito\"smothered \" in the fire roasted \"sauce\". I loved the fact that there were so many options from the beans to the rice and the variety of ways to combine them. However, once the food arrived at our table, the illusion war was over and we were all left disappointed and feeling a little sick.   My daughter absolutely loves chicken. To watch her spit the food out and look at me as if I forced her to eat mud should have been a sign, but unfortunately we pushed on. The food was like warm at best and my burrito was never even made. When we brought this to their attention, they were not apologetic in the least and quite obviously slapped it together in an attempt to prevent further complaints. Oh.. And that fire roasted sauce... It's nothing more than a small bottle of store brand chunky salsa dumped on top of a disappointing burrito filled with meat that they had the audacity to call brisket.  Feta cheese... On Mexican food.. Seriously? It's a moment where a restaurant tried to get cute and failed miserably.   It's a shame this place couldn't hit the mark and being that they are sandwiched between two of our absolute favorite places to eat makes me think Fuzzy's is headed for a disastrous fate. If you find yourself in this shopping center, enjoy yourself a good meal with Cafe Zupas or Pizza Rev."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the past year. The prices are decent and they have free wifi, though it barely works most of the time and outside it's almost impossible to get a signal. I am vegan but some of my friends aren't and they seem to really skimp on the meat in their orders. I don't drink alcohol so I can't speak for the bar drinks but the staff is usually friendly (though I have heard the kitchen cooks make sarcastic remarks about other customers' food when picking up my order which was a bit of a turn off). Great location for walking around downtown and visiting other shops before/after the meal."}
{"text":"When this place first opened up it was ok. Today it's crap food. This place used to give you a descent taco but now they are straight shady. My shrimp tacos were not fully cooked, still raw. Not cool. They were two of the smallest shrimp the eye can see. What a ripoff. The salsa was cold, not hot. No thanks."}
{"text":"Tried Fuzzy's Tacos for dinner tonight wasn't impressed. We wasted National Taco night :(.. When My wife says she'd rather go to Maycos over a place you know it's not good.  (She hates maycos)  We both got deformed J shaped tortilla shells, not much meat in tacos.  No real flavor, and only two choices for hot sauce, both say but burner but just taste like name Brand hot sauces mixed with something else in carona bottles... don't suggest them, and won't be back"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's has been my go-to taco shop on Mill for quite some time now. I used to do shows at the Fixx Coffee shop (which is no longer there) and Fuzzy's was our pre-show ritual.   The wait staff is always helpful and very friendly, especially at the bar. While you're there, get a beergarita and thank me later.   The food is incredible. I usually just stick with the tacos which are always a good choice. Simple, delicious street tacos that put some of the other, more \"high class\" Mexican food on Mill to shame. The guac is also really really good. Highly recommended.   The patio is also a great place to people watch, especially towards the later hours of the evening on a weekend night. The crowd on Mill is always a good time.   Location is also really great. Since it's on the Northern part of Mill you don't have to deal with the \"bros\" going into Cue Club or anything like that. Plenty of parking most of the time.   Definitely recommend this place for a first date or for going out with your friends. Not the best place to take a family, unless you go on a Saturday or Sunday during the day.   Yay Fuzzy's!"}
{"text":"two words... chips and queso. It has ruined every other place i go to but its worth it"}
{"text":"Just returned home with a to-go order.  Ordered a Taco Plate with two sides for the wife and a Combo Plate with taco, enchilada and two sides for myself.  Upon opening the order at home, I found that they shorted me the enchilada and one of my sides.  Not bothering to go back as I waited over fifteen minutes for the initial order to be prepared.  It's no wonder this is the lightest traffic of all the lunch places in the strip center.  Also, my fish taco should have been grilled but it was fried.  Ordered one and one for my wife and both were grilled.  I will not return..."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about this place.  I had their \"jumbo\" burrito but it was a regular sized burrito. I could get a better burrito at Chipotle or Taco Bell. If anyone really thinks this is authentic is very delusional and/or hasn't eaten good Mexican food. I've had their burritos a few times and the overall flavor is lacking.  The redeeming part about this place is their happy hour drinks. They serve huge margaritas for a good price and a good place to start off your buzz. I would come here for the drinks & chips, but prolly would pass on their food."}
{"text":"I was born in the Twin Cities, but my 'formative years' of 15-21 were lived in the Southern gray-area called Austin, TX.  Gray area because it's in Texas, but it's not REALLY 'Texas'; just like they refer to Madison as being \"surrounded by reality\".    Regardless, Austin is a town that knows how to rock the Tex-Mex, and anyone who ever leaves is left with an empty space inside...a space reserved for good Tex-Mex.  Tex Tubbs West had previously come close to soothing the savage beast, with it's Austin-inspired decor and Breakfast Taco offerings.  However, now that they've changed formats from \"awesome\" to \"douchebag\", I had hoped Fuzzy's could fill my newly-empty Tex-Mex space...but just as I expected, they came up short.  The menu is no slouch and gives you a ton of options, which is nice.    My wife ordered a bowl of queso plus a Burrito with Beans, Rice and Cheese.  Simple.  Well, the queso was absolutely tasteless and STONE COLD when they served it....and yet, you could still dip a chip quite easily.  This is because I'd guess that there's no cheese in their queso; just some sort of whitish-orange oil.  Real cheese solidifies as it cools.  Fail.  The burrito tasted a bit like, well, nothing if not for the strangely-tasteless cheese, which they absolutely piled on.  Other than that, it tasted like the salsa it was doused with.  She didn't finish it and she certainly didn't take her leftovers.  Fail again.  I, being fairly particular about my Tex Mex, was very happy to see an Egg/Cheese/Potato/Chorizo burrito in my future.  Scrambled eggs by themselves are difficult to screw up, so we'll pass those.  They were fine; firm, dry, well cooked and not salty.  The potato was a bit overcooked and had the consistency of a dry-paste and the cheese was the same cheap cheese noted above.  Didn't taste like much other than grease.  This ain't Weyauwega Cheddar/Jack or even Queso Blanco, folks.    But my focus here was the Chorizo.  Thankfully, there was a lot of Chorizo in my burrito, because it only tasted like there was a tablespoon.  Weak.  It was there...it was faint...but still, it was true.  They know how to do it...they just made a really weak batch.  Too bad.  Fail #3.  At the end of the night my wife and I deposited our leavings in the trash and brought nothing home.  It was highly disappointing...leaving us once again to turn to Tex Tubbs East for the \"least worst\" Tex Mex in the area.  My recommendation: avoid the Fuzzy Taco at all costs."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places to eat in the Tempe area. The staff are awesome, the tacos are amazing (I always get the grilled shrimp soft tacos, the sauce is absolutely tdelicious and they have some of the best shrimp tacos I have ever had), and they have an impressive selection of drinks to choose from. By far the most appealing aspect for me are the beeritas, which are basically blended margaritas with a bottle of beer mixed in for added flavor and kick. If you are looking for a new taco shop to check out, or a more laid back place to have a few drinks on Mill Ave, then this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"One of my roommates used to work here, and I had been told the food is above average and better than what you pay for. I'm here to call bulls***. I ordered the combo with shrimp enchiladas and need taco with sides of fried potatoes and borracho beans. The sauce was the enchilada was covered in was decent, but the filling was poor, particularly the shrimp. I understand you get what you pay for, but this shrimp had no flavor and a slimy texture and not even a slight outer crunch. Gross. Potatoes had good spices, but were lukewarm and not crispy. The beans tasted like beer, nothing else. Also, they were out silverware. Are you kidding me? How does a restaurant run out of silverware. The taco meat was decent, and the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, but the shell was stale. The only good thing I can say is most people were drinking margaritas, and they looked damn good. I don't recommend this place unless you're looking to get drunk or already are drunk"}
{"text":"I would give one star but the customer service was good enough. The food and value based on how much we paid was another story... as a previous reviewing mentioned, not authentic Mexican food--not close. The rice was awful, bland and tasteless. The portions were very small. I had two tacos, one beef and one chicken. The beef was tough and hard to chew. The chicken taco was flavorless and boring. My husband had enchiladas and the two enchiladas didn't even equal the size of one anywhere else! His tortillas were hard and there was not very much cheese in them. Would not recommend and would not return."}
{"text":"I love Fuzzy's because it's a down to earth Mexican restaurant with reasonably priced food. I personally love their queso, & the margs are delicious! Tips: I would order nachos (comes with the queso on it!) and on Tuesdays some tacos are $1!"}
{"text":"This place is so inconsistent!  Sometimes the food is OK, other times like to today the Burrito is small and has FROZEN LETTUCE inside of it! There is a new employee every single time I go in as well. I wonder why?  Definitely try another place."}
{"text":"Thirty-eight minutes for some so-so tacos?!  I've been an occasional Fuzzy's customer since they opened a few years ago.  I especially like the breakfast tacos, but the fact that they don't open until 9 pretty much rules them out for breakfast.  Service has been hit-and-miss, and I've come to expect that Fuzzy's is never  quick.  Today took the cake, though -- it LITERALLY took THIRTY-EIGHT minutes for me to get three simple tacos.  Thirty.  Eight.  The tacos were fine.  No taco is that good.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My 3rd time here,  had to bring the family.   Was going to keep it my little secret but the minute I begin to eat,  I think about sharing the experience  with the family.  So much for keeping secrets"}
{"text":"We have been trying different places on Taco Tuesday's in Old Town Scottsdale and Downtown Tempe for the last couple of months.  Unfortunately, out of all the places we have been, we both rated this our least favorite place.    The tacos are pretty bland.  Almost all homemade tacos I have had are better than these.  The only reasons I gave it two stars are; 1. They are edible. 2. They are cheap.   I would rather have tacos from Del Taco or Jack-in-the-Box.    I don't understand how it could ever get higher than a \"3 star\" even by intoxicated students looking for cheap tacos?"}
{"text":"Only go on Taco Tuesday for 1/2 price tacos, otherwise it's a tad pricey. The pork tacos are the best, followed by beef then chicken. Sometimes they can be a bit soggy and unfortunately cold. Don't order rice and beans as its just canned refried beans and awful dry rice with a canned veggie mix."}
{"text":"I like Fuzzys tacos y burritos. My fave is the brisket taco and fish tacos. They have taco Tuesday's as well!!!  I cannot resist the brisket burrito smothered in queso!!! Must try it at least once in your life!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick bite before a game at Wells Fargo & was pleasantly surprised. I got a grilled fish taco & a tempura shrimp taco. The fish taco was average, but the tempura shrimp taco blew me away. For sides I got the tex-mex fried rice & black beans, nothing impressive. But definitely try the tempura shrimp taco, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I am from Texas and was so excited to see a Fuzzy's in Arizona.  I am surprised to see such negative reviews as my experience was completely different.  The food was great...especially the fish and shrimp tacos (my favorite).  Service was excellent, beers were incredibly affordable and served in an icy mug.  Perfect atmosphere to have some good food and fun while sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Came here after a friend of mine recommended the place. This is a great little college dive taco shop. Menu choices of tacos, burritos, and even some salads too. The portions are very large and the prices are cheap, a college student's dream.  Looks like this place turns into quite the bar in the evening, lots of draft beer choices and pinnacle vodka seems to be the drink of choice for the hard stuff. Tacos we ordered were very good as was the Queso dip. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time here. Recommended to me by ASU student. Would not come back. Ordered a taco combo plate. Food came out super fast but everything was cold. Prefab taco shells. I think the lime rice would have been yummy if it wasn't a cold lump.  The chips had some kind of seasoning on them which I wish I would have known about I would have had them hold it.  Salsa was good. Good thing was it was pretty cheap, which, now that I think about it, is probably why the college student comes here."}
{"text":"This place is simply great and the food is amazing cashiers are nice and very energetic I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"if u order without onions your gonna get nothin on ur burrito........ just FYI........watch out for this place"}
{"text":"Really not that good. Mediocre at best. Meat does not taste seasoned and overall plain"}
{"text":"I've ne'er had a bad experience here.  The food is always amazing with great sized portions.  The service is always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This chain has over 150 locations. Fuzzy's for Mexican is like going to the Olive Garden for Italian food. Very bland and underwhelmig food. Not even worth a review of the food. The space is nice with flat screens and several tap handles so to stop by for chips and beer it's probably not bad. For a taco shop, the space is giant. There is nothing \"shop\" about this place. At least they didn't call it a \"joint\". There are several Mexican restaurants around that are so much better - La Unica, Three Amigo's, Cantina 1511, and NOBODY serves better fish tacos than Cabo. For real burrito's - the Burrito Factory on South Blvd."}
{"text":"The food at Fuzzy's Taco Shop are so good I never heard of them before until now my Best Friend took me to eat there the owner of the shop came up introduced himself and was so nice now I eat there at least once a when my friends are in town I take them to Fuzzy's Taco we have to support stores in our Community. You have to try this place just once you will get hooked for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often for lunch. Today I called to place an order and I had forgotten to ask for no pico seeing that I am allergic to tomatoes. I rushed there to tell the lady and she said they had already been made. I asked if she could remake them and she said yes but reluctantly and I said sorry very genuinely and kindly but she walked away shaking her head. I know it was my fault but that is terrible customer service. When giving me my order I said thank you and she said thank you back with no eye contact in a hurry."}
{"text":"I went here last night and ordered 2 chicken tacos and chips with guacamole.  The tacos were sooooo nasty. They were dry and flavorless, it was sad. However, they did redeem themselves with good guacamole and a big basket of yummy chips."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to make the line right before everyone rushed in. I came on a Taco Tuesday, and it was SO worth it. Tacos were only $1.50 for one, filled with the good stuff. Chicken, lettuce, tomato, feta, cilantro, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something. Just know 3 tacos were filling and I ordered 5. Also, their \"kick butt\" hot sauce was the just right amount of heat and flavor to compliment the taste of the chicken, loved it. The Sun Devil was delicious and refreshed my taste buds taking away the heat from the tacos with every sip. It gave me a nice slight tipsy, but then again I'm not a big drinker. Totally worth the $8. It's def a gem in Arizona and I would love to come here again. Only thing that's stopping it from 5 stars is it's not that big inside and for a restaurant I don't really get why give a buzzer to pick up your food and not just have someone serve you. I wasn't too happy with getting my drink right away, then having to leave it on the table surrounding a lot of college kids to pick up my food and return back to the table. Besides that, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Fun relaxed atmosphere. Great prices. Love the beers on tap. Tacos are delicious and so is the fajita salad. We come here often by bike and bring our Husky."}
{"text":"I love those beeritas! The price for them are decent. The food will keep you tied over. It's not authentic Mexican so don't expect to be overwhelmed, but it is tasty. Go for the drinks and if your hungry the food will do too. Wish the price of the food matched the taste cuz it could really stand to be cheaper. I like the pleasant and friendly service, and the overall feel of the place. It's fun and that's what I love about it! Shrimp enchiladas are my favorite, but if your trying to save money Taco Tuesday $1.75 per taco is your best bet."}
{"text":"Figured out why they call this place \"Fuzzy's.\"  I wanted to give at least a 4 Star, but ew. None of us have hair like this and it was under layers of other things.   This place needs a hygiene update...desperately..people and the tables. Yuck.  Don't get the salad. The nachos were good but HAIRY."}
{"text":"I loooooooove Fuzzy's!!!....until today! I have a huge family. I ordered 8 steak tacos and 8 fish tacos and chips with guacamole. Tyler took my order and refused my military discount, claiming because it was a Tuesday there weren't any extra discounts because Tacos were a $1.50.   Now I have been coming to Fuzzy's every Tuesday since I moved here from Ohio and use my military discount.  I'm familiar with the owner who is a Michigan fan!! He teases my son's for wearing OSU gear!!! Tyler was rude loud and obnoxious, refused to add my discount and shoved my receipt in my face and said \"Look lady I'm not giving you a discount, do you want me to get fired\" The manager was not there but Westin , I'm assuming was taking the managerial position for the day, stepped in.  He assisted us with a smile, was cordial and added my discount. Meanwhile, Tyler stomped away from the cashier station pouting! Terrible customer service...terrible example of empathy!! Tyler makes Fuzzy a place I never want to come back to!!!  Thank you Westin for all of your help and for keeping Fuzzy's onTuesday regular for us!!!"}
{"text":"Went there last night, it is a very cool place, employees are friendly and seem like they are having a good time, it shows in their service. I had chicken nachos and a brisket taco, both items were great! People who are complaining about that the nachos don't have guacamole or sour cream on them have to look at the price and the size of the nachos, they are only  $7.50. Taco was good and remember this is Tex-Mex food a little different from So-Cal or authentic Mexican. After I ordered my food I realized they have beer on tap, I had to get back in line to order the beer, was told that was the law couldn't order at the bar, bud light in a big cold mug was $3.50, best price I have seen around here. Will be back, I like this place for a casual dinner and drinks, next time will try the big patio, I hoe they get some heaters soon. Good Job Fuzzys!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! Whether you're looking for a spot to hit for taco Tuesday ( be forewarned about the crowds) or somewhere to go for awesome drinks before hitting the town, Fuzzy's is your place. I love their beer-a-rita's, especially the morning glory - mini champagne bottle in a GIANT glass of frozen strawberry/lime margarita mix (I substitute the lime with pina colada flavored)."}
{"text":"Cool place with great food! Bf got the brisket nachos. They serve alcohol and have margaritas. Like the decor feels very California."}
{"text":"I just waited 20 minutes for two tacos that were so bland .  The lettuce was not fresh and the meat had the lard parts in it.  The $3 Tuesday Shiner bock was flat.    When I walked in I saw 99% of the crowd and 100% of the staff were Caucasian. Nothing wrong with that but Thats when I knew in my mind that the food is going to suck.  The kitchen cook with the glasses looked like an IT manager , who was kind enough to apologize for the wait.    The ambience and decor is great, but let's be straight, the place is selling presentation and branding, but the food is average at best.  If they don't step up their game here in Vegas, they'll be history."}
{"text":"Basically, if you're dancing until 1 am at Vintage or Tavern and you want a burrito? You'd be in heaven. 2pm on a Saturday? It's just a mediocre, overpriced burrito I could have gotten a Filly-Bs. Sorry, not really a huge fan."}
{"text":"I love all things Fuzzy's Taco Shop. They are fast and friendly! The line moves fast so don't get discouraged by it. The adult bevys are awesome and the beer is always cold"}
{"text":"We came about this place after a day of shopping. The place is great! Started with Chorizo and cheese dip and chips and had the. Briskett tacos! Everybody was so nice from the cashier to the cook. Plus a good place to go to hangout with friends for a drink. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews of Fuzzy's, so I was hesitant to try it at first, but I eventually gave it a shot. The reviews were wrong. Fuzzy's does a solid taco. They might not be haute cuisine, but they're made with fresh ingredients, on the spot. At first I thought it was a little strange that they put feta cheese on the tacos, but it turned out to be an awesome addition. The sauce that comes with the tacos is decent, somewhat garlicy, and flavorful. The chips and queso are pretty decent, though the queso is somewhat on the mild side.    Fuzzy's isn't fancy, but it doesn't need to be. The food is good, and that's what matters. I recommend giving it a shot."}
{"text":"These are not real tacos. They put shredded cheese on my shrimp taco. :( On a positive note, they have good margaritas."}
{"text":"My last last review was filtered, not sure why. Panchero's, Chipotle, Qdoba, Tex Tubs are places significantly better than this place. There were 4 other people in the place when we arrived on a Saturday night around 7 pm. Tacos were sub par. The dry, flavorless tortilla's made them unappetizing. The meat was room temperature and the beef bland. Quesadilla was soaking in grease, burritos small compared to places listed above.  Avoid this place, save your dollars and go to one of the others above. The group of us pretty much had the same thought on the products, pretty sub-par for a taco/burrito type of restaurant.  The owner did contact me to apologize, was professional and asked me to give them another shot.  However, never heard back from the owner after I gave him my information... Guess this truly is the way this restaurant operates. Stay away."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Walked into the place thinking it was going to be another mediocre taco place. The food is incredibly good and authentic and they have 15 beers on tap. Great prices, great food!"}
{"text":"The best night ever! If you visit Tempe, AZ, Fuzzy's Taco Shop is a must try! We devoured chicken fajita nachos with a Fuzzy Driver margarita"}
{"text":"Checked Yelp, they close at 10pm. Rushed over because I missed dinner due to work tonight.   Walked in at 9:56 to order a couple of tacos. The kitchen staff shook their head at me and said \"no.\"  Wow!  The seemingly floor manager also said \"no we are closed.\"  The cashier apologized (at least he wasn't rude) but also told me he couldn't take my order.  I questioned it being that it was before closing time. They assured me, \"the kitchen already cleaned up.\"  Won't be back. That's terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"I definitely liked this spot. It is not your authentic Mexican cuisine if that's what you're looking for. For me, it was perfect. I can be pretty picky, especially while pregnant, and I didn't have to custom order anything here. Oh I take that back, I ordered my nachos with no feta (YES feta on nachos) but only because it's an unfortunate pregnancy no no. Hubby was not a fan, said it's basically a glorified Taco Bell, which I don't agree with. The chips and queso were bomb, even though the queso was more on the velveeta aspect of cheese. The nachos were huge and enough for multiple people to eat off of, and the sopapillas were the perfect sweet ending. I would definitely come back, but maybe by myself since hubby didn't like it and it was a bit pricey for our whole family of four."}
{"text":"Heard about the grand opening on the radio and went to check it out for lunch that afternoon. GREAT PLACE! Well priced food, speed of service was great, and delicious!! Will be going back for sure. Didn't visit the bar this time but am planning to go back and get a $5.99 frozen marg!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to write this review since I have eaten at fuzzys several times over the past couple years. This is a delivery/food quality review. On 5/15/14 I placed an order for delivery for nachos, two chicken tacos, chips & salsa, and rice & black beans at 5:16 pm. An hour later and still no food. I called the manager and she told me the food was finished and waiting to be delivered. 45 minutes passed and finally the food arrives ( so my food was sitting for 30 minutes before being taken to be dropped off) yuck. The food arrives and the nachos are luke warm and extremely soggy. Immediately tossed in the garbage. The chips had not been seasoned like listed in the online description. The tortilla from our tacos fell apart from absorbing so much moisture and they were luke warm as well. I called back and the manager said \"sometime that happens with delivery\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? She offered no kind of apology or compensation. Just unbelievable. After tossing the rest of the food, my boyfriend and I both agreed Taco Bell would have been a tastier route instead of wasting 40 bucks on the half-assed soggy concoctions we received. Never ordering from here again. If your in the south Scottsdale/Tempe area \"El Molinos\" is a more reliable option for delivery Mexican."}
{"text":"This place is located in a newly built area of restaurants and I had been waiting for them to open every since I saw the sign on the building go up months back.The place was clean and the food came out fast with their friendly staff handing you your order once your buzzer went off. We ordered the fajita beef burrito, fajita chicken quesadilla and the ground beef nachos. Out of the 3 the best was the nachos, my quesadilla was mainly cheese and the beef burrito was okay and the beef was a little tough. A suggestion would be a salsa bar they had got sauce stuff on the table but it didn't enhance the food like different salsa do. At the end of our meal in of the staff offered Togo containers and when we clean our trays another asked about our meal. I hope they keep up that kind of customer service as these days it's hard to find."}
{"text":"I frequent Fuzzy's, and man do I love their food (try the shrimp burrito). However, last night, while dealing with the 2am crowd, the \"manager\" Arianne almost got PHYSICAL with me and some of my friends. We were waiting on our food by the kitchen when she asked us to step back, which we did, however the five foot space was not to her liking and she began cursing and throwing f-bombs at us! No shrimp burrito is worth that. Ridiculously unprofessional. Some of the other staff came by to apologize for her behavior but maybe she should work in a non-customer service oriented field...just my opinion."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and drinks last Thursday before a show at the Marquee. It was one of the only places open but I was pleasantly surprised that the food was so good and the beer Rita's were reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"Food was ok...pretty typical of a college taco shop. The cheerful young man working the register came over to ask how we enjoyed our meals as he was cleaning up tables (he knew we were first-timers, as he had helped us navigate the menu). When we told him the chicken enchilada was missing the chicken (lol), he realized the kitchen had made a mistake and had them box up the correct meal for us to go. Nice gesture. Not sure if I would return here again, but my college kid really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and never disappointed. Big fan of the tacos they are absolutely delicious. Plenty of cocktail choices. The chips and salsa are excellent. On top of all the good food and drink it has a really comfortable atmosphere. You also get to see the kitchen crew put your good eats together in the back. Thank god my son lives right next to this place. It makes it easy to come back taste the love as often as I like."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when I saw that a new mexican food place had opened, especially one that advertises breakfast items.  I finally got a chance to try Fuzzy's today for lunch and I am sad to report, that I left disappointed and even a little horrified at how bad their food is.  Part of the reason I was initially excited about this place was the menu.  They have a pretty nice variety of food listed.  The staff at the registers is friendly and helpful enough, offering to answer any questions that we may have.  Prices are pretty decent, especially for a place located on Mill Avenue.     I ordered their taco plate with mexican rice and refried beans, while my friend ordered their enchilada plate with \"latin fried potatoes\" and borracho beans.  We topped it off with an order of chips and salsa.  We were then instructed to take our receipt to the back of the establishment, where there was a service counter.  Chips were to be picked up there, along with our order when ready.  There is quite a bit of available seating and the establishment as a whole seemed cleaned.  Between the register and the soda fountain is a display case with assorted \"Fuzzy's Taco Shop\" merchandise in it -- including a shirt that states \"If it looks like a taco and smells like fish, it must be a good meal.\"  That pretty much sets the tone for the remainder of the visit, as well as some insight into where they got their name from.  We picked up our chips, which are not freshly made, but decent enough.  They come served in a basked with some type of seasoning sprinkled over the top. Different, but not horrible.  The salsa is served warm.  Again, it tasted okay, but odd.   As we ate our chips and waited for our lunch, we were regaled with the individual running the mic at the food pick-up counter chumming it up loudly with co-workers, as well as occasionally chatting on the mic, announcing things like the current temperature.    Our food was finally ready; we picked it up and dove in.    The food is... bad.  Pre-processed, pre-packaged full-on crap.  The taco shells are no different than the type you'd buy at your local grocery store.  The \"special ground beef\" tasted chock-full of textured soy protein.  The borracho beans were analogous to cracking open a can of pinto beans, dumping them into a bowl and then mixing in some oil and thin slivers of bacon -- nasty.  The rice.  Well, it's worthy of it's own entry here.  Their rice is the kind of rice that would drive Gordon Ramsay crazy.  Best thing I can compare it to is par-boiled minute rice.  Terrible.  Spanish/mexican rice should be a keystone dish for any mexican themed food vendor. When they clearly don't even make their own rice, it's a sure sign of lazy, dis-interested ownership with no passion for food.    Ultimately, we ended up leaving a good portion of our food on the plates.  We will not be returning.  In a place like Arizona where good quality mexican food can be had for a good price all over the valley, I'll be quite surprised if this taco shop, which borrows it's name from slang for female genitalia, lasts more than six months."}
{"text":"My fiancé had kept talking about this place so we decided to go and try it out with her dad and step mom. The food was good. Not a oh my god this is amazing food but it was pretty decent. The drinks are really good. Drinks are Fairly cheap. All the special drinks are frozen slushees so that's always good. Beer for a 18 ounce is only 4.99 which is pretty good price for a good size beer. Can't wait for this place to open in Berewick so I can go drink some good cheap drinks. I got the taco and enchilada plate. My taco is a fish taco and my enchilada is a shrimp enchilada with black beans and mix mex rice."}
{"text":"I don't see how this place only has three starts. MILITARY 50% off!!! Also their crawfish is amazing, their nachos are crazy good and their taco Tuesday and happy hour options are some of the best. Have been here plenty of times and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was not good. Feta on tacos if u like that kinda of thing. Cafeteria style food. Everything is pre prep and make quickly which take any from freshness. Better than del taco I guess."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great food options and the portions are on point. The atmosphere is chill and relaxing. The food quality is much, much better than Roberto's or Zabas (not sure what else to compare this place with). The service was outstanding! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is a great place for young people, walking around Mill. The restaurant is nothing fancy. Its decorated/painted in very bright colors, TVs hang along the walls and there's a HUGE booth in the back corner.  The food is cheap and clearly, they are known for their tacos. The frozen mango margarita I ordered was big and delicious.   With the restaurant so close in location to the ASU Football & Basketball Stadiums, they offer Game-Day Specials and a signature Sun Devil marg. If you're in the area, I would check it out."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is welcoming I found several downfalls. Waitstaff had attitude. We ordered guacamole and it was a puke green color like it was from two days ago. Also got soft shrimp tacos, the shrimp was somewhat edible but the tortillas were cold, beans were as well and disgustingly dry. Rice out of the box blows this place's out of the water. Only remotely appealing food item was the chicken quesadilla that was packed full of chicken. I'll keep in mind to make sure Im not sober if I ever return."}
{"text":"Good, cheap tacos. They were better than I was expecting. I only had fish tacos but my husband tried some of the other varieties and liked them. Cheap beer, too. Good no-frills tacos and beer are enough for me to come back again."}
{"text":"Yeah,  so this place is new and has a lot of potential.  The inside is really nice,  plus it has an outdoor seating area; great for the cooler months.  They serve beer,  which is a plus, though I didn't have any.  It did look like a good selection though.   The food.  Well maybe it was what I ordered.  I ordered the taco plate (two tacos of my choice and two sides).  I chose to have a shrimp taco and shredded chicken taco,  both with corn tortillas. A side of the cilantro-lime rice and black beans.  Unfortunately,  this was about one step better than Cafe Rio and for those that follow me,  you know I hate Cafe Rio.  Not a good first showing.    The staff, on the other had, is great. Super friendly and helpful,  you can tell the really enjoy their jobs.   I'm not sure if I will try it again. It's a challenge to get to. The parking lot is impossible and Rainbow is alway busy.  Give it a try,  let me know what you think.   Cheers."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with great nightly specials.  Great food and great prices. Definitely heading back on my next trip to Tempe."}
{"text":"When is this establishment going to respect a customers wishes and advice and start serving horchata?  It's a decent place for tacos, but without horchata, it is not a true mex restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great Pork & Chicken tacos. Taco Plate included 2 tacos and 2 sides. A great value at $7.03 including tax. My only complaint is that they use corn tortillas for soft tacos where they should offer flour tortillas."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and very reasonably priced.  The nachos and salads are big and can serve more than one person.  The tacos are yummy too!"}
{"text":"Quite honestly I didn't have very high expectations for this place and what do you know - we didn't like ANY of the food we ordered. I got the chicken enchiladas plate with cilantro lime rice & black beans; my boyfriend got the shrimp enchilada and shredded beef taco combo plate with the borracho beans & latin fried potatoes. The enchilada sauce that the chicken enchiladas were smothered in was alright but unfortunately, the rice was undercooked to the point of crunchy and the black beans were just plain tasteless. The taco tasted like the shell was stale and the borracho beans tasted like they were cooked pinto beans on which someone had poured beer and served. The fried potatoes were really mushy & oily and salty.  When we had walked in to get a table, all we saw were people drinking huge margaritas. Apparently they must've known what we didn't - don't bother ordering any food .. or order after having a few drinks. Each of our meals were $7.57. I could've gotten a better deal at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"the lady at the cash register was very nice and helpful with our orders.  its not that expensive  and they have special dollar drinks.. definitely will come back"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I've been here twice and the first time I came, I had tacos with a side of black beans and to be honest they came just straight of a can and were not warm. The second time I came here, I've had chorizo, potato, egg and cheese, and it did not settle well with my stomach.  I do not know what they do behind the counter but I feel that something is going wrong."}
{"text":"The garlic sauce and feta on these tacos is what makes them so amazing. If you're feeling gluttonous, get the nachos in order to get your taco fix. It's got all of that plus yummy queso. Queso/&chips is just okay on it's own but it makes the nachos heavenly. All of the meat options are fantastic. It's hard to say which is the best between the brisket, chicken, or beef. If I go tacos, I like the grilled or tempura shrimp tacos.   The beergargaritas are my favorite part about this place, obviously. One is enough to get the job done. I've tried all of them at this point, including the one with an IPA and a shot of Jim Beam, but you can't go wrong. Boyfriend always gets the Red, White & Blue, which is a strawberry margarita with a delicious Wild Blue (8%!) blueberry beer. My go to is always the Easy Rider, with an O'dell Easy Street and raspberry liquor."}
{"text":"Yummy food! The tacos are the best in town. The menu has many options to put in your tacos. Very clean, fun and upbeat environment. The staff so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's Taco Shop offers cheap and delicious food in a colorful dining room. Staff were pretty friendly and the food was not only cheap and delicious, but also filling. Also a nice outdoor patio. Drive thru Starbucks is next door, which limits parking options."}
{"text":"Not a fan. As another reviewer said, on par with Taco Bell, or Del Taco, only priced a lot higher. The beef Taco was just bad. Perhaps the carne asada is better, but I don't know. The chicken taco was decent, but not enough to redeem my disappointment of the beef.  Queso was great. I liked that a lot  On a minor annoyance, all the food coming in a separate platter made a table of 4 very cramped, and just annoying.  I wanted to love it, but I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Maybe fuzzy tacos aren't for everybody?   Just a straight up no thanks.  You order and then grab your food from a window. I decided on a taco plate with one chicken & fish and a side of refried beans and cilantro-lime rice. Everything was bland. I had to cover the entire plate with limes and hot sauce. The shredded chicken taco was the only thing that was decent but the fish was super dry. They also don't have salsa or a salsa bar. Really? A fast food Mexican place without a salsa bar? Normally I would never use hot sauce but that wasn't an option here.   The space itself was nice and industrial with lots of natural light but it was filthy with trash on tables and all over the floors. I always get discouraged when I see that because I wonder what goes on in the kitchen. Skip this one as there are far too many great Mexican options around town."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad for Tex-mex. It was an easy to reach location with good ambiance. The flow was a little awkward and confusing to get my food, but overall it was average.  I ordered the brisket nachos, but they were a little bland and on the verge of being overpriced. They only put cheese, meat, and pico on the chips, and if I wanted peppers or sour cream it was extra. I guess I expected more. It tasted very similar to the average fast food joint... Del Taco, Taco Bell etc.   But the one thing that was a bonus is that they do serve alcohol! But the food wasn't my favorite."}
{"text":"great food, fish tacos the best, and the beef nachos are great comes with queso mmm so good.  $2.25 for taps 20oz  and same with the  margaritas. the burritos are good but to much lettuce so say easy lettuce and extra meat."}
{"text":"$2 drafts...cheap quality tacos situated on a cool ass street. Hell yeah, I'm a fan"}
{"text":"I'm batshit crazy about this place. As in, I've strongly considered buying their T-shirt. I also have their souvenir cup (although I always forget it at home), too.  With that say, don't let this little shop trick you into thinking that they don't serve good food. They serve great good! I've tried nearly all their tacos and I haven't got a bad one yet. Love their chips and guac (no fuzzy dust, please). They give you a really large portion of guac and while I haven't seen them make it (or asked) I'd guess they make it fresh every day. I've yet to find better guac.  GF is a vegetarian and also loves this place.  Have ordered multiple of their frozen margaritas and they too are also delicious.  The only negative is that sometimes some downtrodden people come into the store. I personally don't care and actually kind of like it that Fuzzy's allows some of these folks to come in to get away from the heat, get a water, or eat some food. We could all have a little compassion.  The only thing that would probably stop me from going here is if I learned that they were putting drugs in their food to make me want to repeatedly come back. But then again, I guess if they did that then I'd be back there anyways, huh? LOL."}
{"text":"When I found out they had breakfast tacos, I was elated! Finally, a taste of home. But over several visits and a sampling of many menu items, their service is above and beyond.. but their food just isn't very good. It's unfortunate because the dishes sound great but the actual product is lackluster.  - As many other reviews mention, tortillas are cold and seem store bought. They also have very little protein. If tacos are your specialty, why are they your worst item?! + Tortillas and portions aside, the brisket tacos are fairly good and I don't find them easily in town. That is probably my protein of choice here. + Oh, and opt for the California Heat style if you're doing shrimp, otherwise it's pretty plain. + Their Baja tortilla soup is thick and chunky like a stew, and actually really good. Recommend this, would order again. + They have breakfast tacos!! And they're served at all hours!! - But they were really disappointing. Aside from the cold tortilla, they scramble the toppings into the egg, which isn't what I'm used to. The egg looks and tastes like it was cooked on a filthy flattop. Why do something if you don't do it well?! + While not difficult to execute, their salads are pretty good and the avocado dressing is hands down the best I've tried. - But splurge for shrimp, because the shredded chicken is super dry - No salsa bar?! Their branded bottles on the table are more for flavor and not heat, and made me think of an upgraded version of the stuff in Taco bell packets.  Like I said, minor issues that a little attention to detail could fix. The service is super friendly, attentive, and genuine. They just need to get the kitchen staff on board with the same priorities, so I can come back for queso and chilaquiles.. they definitely have potential."}
{"text":"Hydrated about 3 1/2 stars really so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt...  Great food, can be a little light on the main ingredient from time to time depending on who's cooking. Sometimes on the line gets long they only have one cashier which if you're like me will drive you crazy!  Zneed to have some kind of salsa other than just sauce, it would be good to have a couple of chips thrown in with my meal... Think Chuey's.  Nice menu, and otherwise great food choices, good bar, and an awesome dive type atmosphere!  Not the absolute best place to eat but the food is rocksolid and the people are nice!"}
{"text":"Both my husband and I had tacos. He had the beef and I had the shredded chicken, Both were just OK. The guacamole is what was the best. Fresh and chunky. Chips have a hint of what looks like cumin and overall quite tasty. I bet this place is pretty busy on the weekends or nights; we were there during the mid afternoon and service was just OK. Metered parking on the side as well."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was a great find, low cost with good food and drinks. I mean really low $2 tacos beef, pork, fish, chicken, etc. I had the fish and the beef which were stellar. Service was fast even though the place was crowded, hello college students trying to save and have a good meal. Def the place to go when you are trying to save money while not skimping on the quality."}
{"text":"Omg this place is disgusting!! I went yesterday and there was a white hair in my taco, there was a huge line at the cashiers so I didn't have the time to ask for a refund , they offered to make another one 10 minutes later they had completely forgotten about it. I was sitting by the kitchen and the cooks dont even tie their hair , which most of them have long hair they completely lack hygiene, Never in my life will I set foot in this place. If you decide to disregard this review and still go. Watch closely what you will be putting in your mouth!"}
{"text":"This place was suggested by a friend of mine. On a Saturday night this place was not super busy. So many options to choose from on the menu. I ordered three tacos (grilled shrimp, chicken, and veggie), some cilantro-lime rice, and a drink. If you purchase their big plastic cup, you get to take that home. The wait wasn't too long and there was enough seating. I loved everything but the veggie taco. There wasn't anything wrong with it, just wasn't my taste. I love that they overloaded the lettuce on the tacos and the cilantro-rice topped Chipotle. The next time I come in, I will try something else because everything on the menu sounded delicious!"}
{"text":"The tacos were good,  when they finally arrived. Unfortunately this was 30+ min later on what quickly became a to-go order. I will try them again sometime,  but this place just doesn't have the quick turnaround needed for a weekday lunch.   There was nowhere to sit and even standing room was  scarse. Tuesdays are $1.75 tacos so everyone was here for lunch. I had to eat in my car =/"}
{"text":"Great looking place  Waitress was very nice. Food tasted very fresh. You will need a doggie bag. Would come back.."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Fuzzy's taco shop! Our party of 8 left quite satisfied and it didn't break the bank.  The brisket tacos were really good- I would recommend soft shell not crunchy. Two types of rice- Tex mex and cilantro lime. I had the cilantro lime and loved the flavor. Beans were ok. The queso dip wasn't too good IMO but my friend loved it. Hubs got spicy pork burrito which was huge. Kids were happy with their meals too.  I def want to come back!!! Great food and fun location downtown Tempe. Lots of people to watch."}
{"text":"The best crunchy tacos I've had in a minute! They have many different meats to pick from and so many other options of food you can try! Burritos, tacos, nachos, quesadillas, a breakfast menu, and a variety of alcohol!   I decided to try out the ground beef tacos and the shredded chicken ones. The chicken ones were my fave! They were full of flavor and were topped off with cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes! There is also two different salsas at each table. The cashier was very friendly when taking our order and gave us all three a free drink. (Free drink when downloading the app) Definitely going to stop by for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is my favorite place to eat in Madison. If you like it hot the habenero hot sauce is great. Well priced, can't rave enough."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Fuzzy's and came away a little disappointed! Our food took 22 minutes to arrive, was bland in flavor and small portions. I ordered a breakfast entree that was under seasoned and looked like a mixed up dog food hash.  Maybe I'll try their Tacos next time and request extra seasoning."}
{"text":"I've gotten food here twice so far, and both times the tacos and burritos were quite good. Nice portions of meat, and a satisfying taste. I'll be back again for more!"}
{"text":"Not very good shrimp not tasteful . While they didn't even give me shrimp . While the garlic over powered and the feta did not go great . Sorry but I wouldn't go again ."}
{"text":"Ok, let's get negatives out of the way: it's bright as day in here, which makes the ambience strange/maybe a little off putting even. Especially when it's not very busy, which is often. Also, the flavored margaritas are not stellar.  Now the positives. This place is a freakin deal! Food/tacos are definitely above average, and two entrees with two alcoholic drinks and we are out of here at $25! On top of that, they play 80's music all the time (we go in the evenings) which makes it fun. Plus sports on the tv's, it's all good. Definitely a place we enjoy coming back to."}
{"text":"My sister in Denver used to rant and rave about Fuzzy Taco Shop there, so I was excited to see this location open in Las Vegas. Went last night and LOVED the food. The menu is expansive and they serve alcohol there. I had the combo that included a  taco and a enchilada plus two sides ($6.99) VERY REASONABLE PRICES.  My boyfriend, who is hard to impress, loved it also.   A couple of people around me had nachos and they were MASSIVE. I will try those next time.   I am glad Fuzzy's is in town, it will be my go to place next time I want quality  food at a great price!"}
{"text":"some of the food was cold. it is an odd take on Mexican food, with unique sauces and such. It is what I would expect from great Midwestern Mexican. Overall disappointment."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex??? who called this tex-mex?  It is not.  It is Baja-style food with a Baja-style surrounding.  And the prices are awesome.  We looked around at other menus at restaurants on Mill and were amazed at the outlandish pricing on food...then we stumbled into Fuzzy's.  The two of us had a great meal and a large beer on tap for under $20...total!.  Hard to beat.  And the food was some of the best on Mill Ave.  I'm a fan and will continue to go back when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their portions seem to get smaller but I love the pork, brisket, and shrimp tempura tacos! I had a breakfast hard taco that was a game changer also. Good stuff"}
{"text":"Not great not terrible. Pretty good. The ordering was fine. Young African American lady in the middle with ponytail really knew the menu items and gets an A for accuracy and speed. Good that they repeat your order back to you. The whole bar thing needs some tweaking. You get a table number and they ask you stand at bar to wait for beverages. It was Cinco de Mayo, so the craziness may be gone on a regular Saturday?  Some of the runners seemed less than helpful, being it was our first time here like so many others we overheard, we had a few questions . Our queso was served lukewarm -timing needs improvement.  Again, could have been frantic due to Cinco de Mayo. Only day 3, so will return and may update rating. Food portions are good, especially the kids meals. All under $6 and includes a drink. Although  not authentic, it is good for the price against traditional Mexican spots,  which only seem to keep rising astronomically for their products."}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS NOT AMAZING BUT BUT IT IS GREAT DRUNK FOOD (very tex mex like i.e.  crunchy taco- not a fan of it)   THE PRICES ARE PERFECT  BEER-ITAS = Margarita-with-a-Corona-in-it A MUST order it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Tried Fuzzy's for the first time today!  I don't know how this place wasn't jam packed, best street tacos I've ever had!  Their tempura fish taco was so good!!  The cashier was totally helpful, the atmosphere was great, and it's super cheap.  Josh, you definitely know what you're doing!  I'd recommend this hidden gem to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Cashier was very nice. The guy at pickup counter was a complete a**hole! Horrible attitude and demeanor.  I'll  pass this review to other students and residents of DT Tempe. Should've gone to Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"We receive welcoming service every time we go there. The cashier is always friendly and even though it's not really a place with wait service, we've always had someone stop by our table to ask how things are going.   It's a bit pricey for tacos, but the burritos are gigantic. They are generous with guacamole and cheese. I ordered the chicken burrito, which was nicely seasoned, but you either have to have a giant mouth to eat it properly or be prepared to eat bites of onions, bites of cheese, bites of guacamole, and bites of chicken.    To be on the safe side, make sure to carry some cash. We've had the credit card machine flake out on us more than once."}
{"text":"Don't pass this place by.  Got the grilled shrimp taco and it was spicy and the right kind of tangy.  They also put feta in it which I never would have thought of for tacos but it worked!  Cute atmosphere in the heart of the mill street district."}
{"text":"If your in the neighborhood, and have a craving for Fuzzy's take on Mexican food, this may be the only two reasons you could come up with to visit. I have tried Fuzzy's several times over the years, and while I like the food, it is a mostly hit or miss place. Good luck trying to find a parking space, as Starbucks shares a lot with Fuzzy's. My most recent trip was mostly successful; the big menu board above the cash register has the different menu items grouped by color, which it makes it easier to locate which menu item you might want. All of the sides were available on this visit, I can't say that for former visits. And I didn't have to wait for my food, again, unlike previous visits. But it still 'looks' dirty and still feels sticky, even if it isn't. You can sit outside the door on nice days at their picnic tables and you can bring your dog to hang out with you on the patio, if you want. They also have drink specials, if your into that."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER GO TO FUZZY'S TACO SHOP!!!!!  FOUND DEAD FREAKY LOOKING BUG ON TRAY OF LUNCH!!!!!  This was my 3rd time going there.  I took my coworker to FUZZY'S & we got our Food.  Half way into our Lunch, my Coworker has this Sour Face & points to his Tray.  I was like What?    Guess What?  He points to a DEAD FREAKY LOOKING BUG!!!!    I don't if it was a Bug or Scorpion, but Very DISGUSTING & DIRTY!!!!  I went to Management told them what happened.  They just gave us a refund for Lunch, Nothing else.  I wasn't looking for anything free, but this is a SERIOUS HEALTH CODE VIOLATION!!!!!  So I called the Southern Nevada Health District & Reported them.  They will have a Health Inspector check out the Place in the Near Future.  One more thing, I was also very Embarrassed to take my coworker there, because of what Happened!  BUT PLEASE DO NOT GO THERE, BECAUSE OF THIS HEALTH CODE VIOLATION!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place... great food, great prices, great concept, great atmoshpere, etc... I was pleased with this place.  Service is quick, has a bar, has an outdoor patio also. I liked that you can buy a drink (comes in a 32 oz. sturdy, brand decorated plastic cup), keep it and bring it back for a $1.25 refill, every visit... c'mon that is pretty cool. :-) I suggest giving them a try."}
{"text":"Great selection of food and drinks. Great service and friendly conversation. Different specials for different days."}
{"text":"Great little Taco shop.. Great vibe always people here. Grilled fish tacos are great with habanero hot sauce  !!!"}
{"text":"Not mexican tacos. American bland tacos. We got two shredded chicken tacos and one spicy pork. The shredded chicken left a lot to be desired but the spicy pork at least had a white sauce that was pretty good.  I could tell the cheese, lettuce and tomatos all came prepackaged. No originality, no special sauces or spices, nothing to bring a consumer back except taco tuesday which their tacos are $1 instead of $2.  We wont be back."}
{"text":"It's okay, it's not amazing, it's not special, it's mill avenue quick food just a pay grade above fast food...the tortilla chips are bland and crumbly too, thus making the nachos pretty useless.  Not really worth any major hype or a far drive, it's a place to fill up before a night of drinking on mill. If you're going to have a first date on mill with some cute girl don't take her to fuzzy's, you'll be holding in bean farts and garlic breath all night. Not exactly a great first impression.  Food was fine, service at the cashier stand was fine, but the line cook guys at the window you pick up orders from are kind of touchy and moody, they're special snowflakes who think they're too good to help customers or answer questions...gee guys you do have it hard putting tacos into wrappers, I totally understand your stress...  attitude adjustment needed in the pickup section."}
{"text":"Wow, three years in between reviews. Now, everybody is playing Pokemon Go and Fuzzy's has buzzer's to let you know when the food is ready. The taco combo plate comes to about 7 bucks and those Latin potatoes are still good and the cilantro lime rice seems to be a new addition as a side dish. Both the brisket and chicken tacos contained alot of great meat and these are always tasty tacos. The rude cashier was another issue, but she got revenge on herself by giving me the incorrect change. With her error, I only paid about 3 bucks for my meal....yep karma is a bitch."}
{"text":"Delish! Great drink specials, delicious tacos and great service! Definitely will be back! Try the fish tempura and fajita beef tacos. Yum!"}
{"text":"Get your head out of the gutter. Fuzzy's is a relatively new spot to Madison. Tough to get to if you're a college student without a car, but the trip is worth it. It's a great spot if you're looking for something light and fresh.   I usually go with either the fish or shrimp tacos, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have a signed picture of Steve Stricker on the wall, which is a definite plus in my book.   It's a spot I will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"Garlic Shredded Beef +1 Tempura Fish +1 Soft/Crispy shell choices +1 $1.99 tacos +1 Daily specials +1 All the positives of Taco Bell without the diarrhea? Priceless."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I love Fuzzy's, used to go all the time when I lived in Tx. I was so excited when it came out here but lately it's been terrible. Customer service is spotty at best. Past few times the food has been made wrong and then the employees had attitude about making it right. I am bummed because l love the place but this location is ruining it, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Fuzzy's when we can and we are ALWAYS happy with our meal. The tacos and quesadillas are delicious and the staff is friendly and nice. We like the atmosphere, it's super chill. You should DEF check it out."}
{"text":"Surprisingly fun and affordable mex place on Mill Ave.   My boyfriend and I wanted to eat a different mex food than usual and he thought of Fuzzy Tacos since I hadn't been there.    I had the fajita chicken and veggie taco both w/ corn tortilla. My boyfriend ordered the pork, fajita chicken and beef tacos with flour.   The pork taco was by far the best! All the tacos had a garlic sauce, melted cheese and feta cheese +fresh lettuce and tomato. I know the feta cheese is kind of unexpected in a mex place, but it actually works perfectly- also I am a fan of saving calories!! *Lame I know...   I had the margarita and my boy had the beer. Both served in a cold glass, a BIG cold glass. The margarita had a fun taste and was not too strong, which I like. PS. I asked the bartender not to make it strong, because I was driving.   Also, everything was served with a smile and the cashier and bartender checked up on us a few times. The place looked very clean.   Happy hour margaritas are $1.00 off (around $4.50) and huge!!"}
{"text":"Fun and friendly place; affordable Mexican food.  Tacos and burritos are tasty and reasonably priced. Located on the main drag on the campus of ASU, I'm sure it's very popular with the college crowd.  The food was good and fast and cheap, so what more can you ask from a small taco joint?"}
{"text":"Really mediocre Mexican food. Bland, commercial example of this type and feta cheese doesn't belong in tacos!"}
{"text":"I am pretty sure the tortilla in my burrito was the cheapest tortilla you can find in Walmart (or something of that sort). And first ever taco shop I have ever been rejected a salsa with my burritto. After the order came out I asked for salsa and I was told it costs extra. What kind of taco shop refuses to provide salsa with burritos. I mean common its not the Guacs I was asking, its Salsa."}
{"text":"An absolutely disappointing lunch. The only reason I gave 2 instead of 1 star was because my three year old seemed to like the chips and salsa. I ordered her a chicken taco with potatoes for the side. A cold, dry pile of shredded chicken next to cold, shriveled, pathetic potatoes arrived. I asked for a mild salsa for my child instead of the \"butt burning hot sauce\" on the table. I was told it would cost extra. All of the food was so cold that the shredded cheese wasn't even close to being melted.  To top it off, the dining area was filthy. I will never come back. This place won't be around long anyway."}
{"text":"When the stars line up in your favor, I hope you find yourself at Fuzzy's on Taco Tuesday in between rushes, like I did today. Local's tip: pork soft taco. Thank me later!"}
{"text":"I must have passed by this place about hundred times every time I hung out on Mill Ave; but it wasn't until Sunday two weeks ago that I finally got a chance to discover yet another eatery gem in Tempe. Since my \"great\" discovery two weeks ago, I have already been here 3 times total. That means something!   The cafeteria style fits in with the fiesta/Sun Devils theme decor of the place. You stay in line, order food, then pay. If you happen to order alcoholic beverages as well, the cash register will ID you then ask you to wait right at the counter for your beverages; before you walk away to sit down and wait for your food order no. to be called.   I came in for Taco Tuesday with an order of 3 crispy tacos: tempura fish, shredded pork and shredded beef. They are all good but my personal favorites are tempura fish and shredded pork - so flavorful and fresh with different spices and textures. The tacos are decent sized topped with queso fresco, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and ranch dressing!  Besides the delicious bites, their variety of magaritas paired with different beer is great hit, also. So far I have tried their Shocker and SunDevilrita and they are both refreshing with just enough amount of alcohol to get your buzz on. They also offer Corona on tap which I often don't see in other places.   Overall, great place to eat, drink, hang out with your pals, celebrate taco tuesdays, cinco de drinko, or any other random fiestas that your inner party-self wishes. Decent portion and value. The only reason why I gave this place a 4 instead of 5 is I feel that the place could have been a little bit cleaner and brighter."}
{"text":"Ok, so here's the deal.   If you're looking for street tacos or something that rivals of Roberto's, this is not what you should expect.   Fuzzy's is more Tex-Mex style than anything else, and I absolutely love it.   Coming from the Midwest, you start to miss white-wash Mexican food and this place delivers. Queso, tasty salsa, nachos, flour soft tacos, etc..   Things to try: - nachos - chips and salsa / queso (their chips have this addicting seasoning) - chicken enchiladas  - burritos are all good    The wait is never long, the staff are super friendly, and I love their soda cups. Re-useable cups are always good to have.   Price is competitive and their beer prices are unbeatable.   I've embarrassingly been here 3 times this week. Kinda glad I live 2 blocks away but my growing belly is going to say differently."}
{"text":"This is from July... sorry so late. Food is very good for \"Mexican\" comida. Kids love it. Consistent with the founding location back in my hometown of Fort Worth, TX. Looks like this could be a family favorite. They also have a nice little selection of souvenirs up front and adequately priced."}
{"text":"For $1 tacos you can't beat this place on Tuesday!They load them up and the hot sauce is really really good."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and ordered veggie tacos, chips and guacamole. I'm not a vegetarian but love veggies and thought these veggie tacos were pretty good. They do a fried carrot as the base which was pretty tasty. I added my salsa and guacamole to the tacos and it took my veggie tacos to a who new level of good.   Veggie tacos  - fried shredded carrot base - black beans  - lettuce - tomato - cheese (two types) - guacamole  - salsa   You order at the register, get a device that buzzes when you're food is ready, then you pick it up at the cooks window. It's efficient.  The atmosphere is open. Like warehouse open. There are lots of tv's to catch a game too. The staff was friendly too.  I like Fuzzy's even though it's not real Mexican food. I guess it's more TexMex than anything else.   I'll be back to try meat based dishes and I would come here for a few beers to catch a game. Chill vibe."}
{"text":"First taco joint I went to that charges 50 cents for salsa verde... got a salad that tasted like they bought a premise bag from Walmart. Would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Great food. Cant say enough good things about Fuzzy's. Best tex/mex in vegas. The queso and chips are so delicious. Tempura fish dishes are all wonderful. The flavor of the borracho beans is crazy good."}
{"text":"I love tacos and Fuzzy's are some of the best! 9 out of 10 times that I go the food and service is always great. The only cons are that it's right on Mill Ave so you have to pay for parking and if your not into drunken college students then you can only go certain times."}
{"text":"From enjoying numerous Mexican restaurants in Denver, I'm always on the look out for some good authentic Mexican food (or at least knock-off Mexican food). I remember the meal saying 'jumbo' burrito but feeling hungry when I finished. I had shredded pork in the burrito, that was a good eat. But the price seemed a little high for the quantity I received (not to say it's expensive though).  From the way my friend talked about the place, I didn't expect it to be as small as it was. Granted, it wasn't very busy at the time of our visit; but I'd hate to go when they were. I did see some large beer vessels sitting at a few tables, great for a large group.  I was also given some grief from my friend for not ordering tacos from a 'taco shop'. In can't help it if I enjoy other meals outside of a taco - I would have definitely been left hungry if I chose that limited option, after seeing his plate.  I think this place is more ideal to get a few beers with drinks and enjoy a light meal. I don't see the allure in Fuzzy's, but I'm sure I'll be back again - it seems to be popular with some of my friends.  Also - where can I find a Mexican place that serves Chimichangas in Madison??"}
{"text":"you ever had your taste buds slap you in the face and ask you. \"I am not sure what you are feeding me? but don't you stop!\"  Fuzzy's is my all time favorite taco joint, everything from the margaritas to the SOFT SHELL tacos!, don't do the hard shells. the taco sauce is so good, you could drink it.   If i could eat here every day i absolutely would, worth it! eat here!"}
{"text":"New Restaurant that just opened in September. I've had Fuzzy's in Texas before and it was good there. These guys are going to become a 5 star place in no time!  The fountain drink cups are big and can be used on return trips for $1.25, which I found to not only be a good deal, but clever marketing! I love that they sell individual tacos! I had a shredded chicken soft taco and found it a little dry for my liking - good, but just not that great. The second taco I had, my favorite was a fajita beef crunchy! It was amazing. It was a little more in price compared to the shredded beef option - which I'm going to try next time. They have employees circulating the floor and my tray was taken for me after I was finished.   They also about 14 beers on tap plus margaritas and other drink options - which is what sets them apart from other restaurants similar."}
{"text":"We went for lunch. We had a brisket burrito and California heat tacos on flour tortilla. It was great. I really like the borracho beans. It was a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"stumbled (literally) upon fuzzy's last weekend after Oktoberfest, my brief fun chasing down my other's friends bike cab made me hungry, and my brief conversation with an ASU coed who was wondering about the dick on my tee got me curious... to try out this place. I was seriously wanting slices but my friend Dani who I was walking with persuaded me to try out the place coz we were right next to it, and we were tipsy. So, walking in you really get that there's nothing local about this place, it's so commercial and chainish that it's disheartening with how Mill ave sold out. Anyways, saw the lackluster choices, and noticed that for breakfast burritos they were missing a basic item choice, a SAUSAGE burrito, heck that's common at every bertos drive thru, it's like a cheese quesadilla it's such a normal thing to order, WTF?! so ordered a bacon, cheese and egg burrito and waited for it to come out. Got the burrito and was dismayed with how non-hefty it was. for $4.50 i expect hefty, thick, with grease dripping, and it should be too thick to put in my mouth because it's so big BUT sadly this burrito was limp! LIMP! and it really wasn't satisfying, Del Taco's even better than this, and del taco tastes damn good when you're drunk, to the point you think it's so delicious that it's gourmet, sadly this was alright. My experience was eh, and the owner/manager dude asked how i liked it, and let's just say alcohol reveals the truth. Any chance of me coming back? never."}
{"text":"When you're out trying to relive your college days and suddenly need something to satisfy your extreme drunk hunger, keep Fuzzy's in mind. This might be one of the better options on Mill Ave. My sis and I ordered 6 different tacos to sample, ranging from soft tortillas with shredded chicken to crunchy shells with shrimp. The tacos were tasty, although it would have been nice to add some salsa or spice to them to make the meal a tad bit more unique (salsa bar, anyone?!). We did have to wait a while for our meal but that could also be the beer talking."}
{"text":"If you are tired of the same, humdrum, Mexican food place (and let's face it, AZ has a LOT of them) I recommend trying Fuzzy's Taco Shop on Mill Avenue!  I read the previous reviews on here and couldn't be more dumbfounded with the response.    This place was: Friendly? Check. Helpful? Check. Tasty? Check.  This is a regular stop for me when I'm on Mill.  I love the food, the happy hour gives you huge cheap drinks (if you drink -- I do not, but I recognize the appeal for everyone else), the service is with a smile, and the comfortable seating  (inside and outside) really does it for me.  Their salads are amazing, tacos (soft tempura shrimp tacos are my fav) are out of this world, and their burritos are HUGE!  You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients and the flavors blend well.  The one thing that I will say is that one time, I got a beef burrito that contained a lot of fatty meat.  Other than that, it's been pretty yummy.  So, please, do yourself a flavor and check this place out! :)  You won't regret it (coming from a girl who usually avoids tacos or burritos, I think that that says a lot!)  Yay! Fuzzy's! :)"}
{"text":"My rating is really about a 2.5.  I've never been there when it's not Taco Tuesday. It's cheep tacos.  Nothing fabulous, but they are edible.  The crispy taco shells are like the kind you get at the grocery store.  I have tried the different sides (black beans, the rice, the potatoes), all have no flavor.    I have classes on Tuesdays so I am in the area.  I would not make a trip to dine at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good cheap food. The sundevil beer Rita was good if you like the sweeter side of a margarita. I would highly recommend the pork tacos."}
{"text":"This place was fun and friendly.  The service was great.  They were a little behind in the kitchen with one of our orders and the Chef came out to apologize.  He then came back with the food.  Okay, it is not gourmet, but it is good.  The breakfast was delicious.   Good drink specials, good food and very friendly service from the cashier to the chefs.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. My wife is an ASU grad and always talks about Fuzzy's. After 4 years of being together she finally took me here. The California Heat Tacos were my absolute favorite. The shrimp and toppings made the absolute best taco of my life. Still craving them. The Beergarita was so good that I had to have two of them!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my faves!   I work right around the corner and love coming here for lunch. Their quest dip and shrimp tacos are must haves.   Brought my husband here for dinner once and he also became a fan :)"}
{"text":"Tex Mex style menu and items even though their hottest item is the 'California Heat'. I like the vibe and the items had nice twists. I did order the California Heat and it was good. I wasn't super hungry so I only ordered one with a side of rice. If I was more hungry, I could've easily eaten two. It was really tasty and full of kick in it. They seem to have a lot of people ordering their drink specials. I was not drinking either but if I was, the items looked good so I would come back to try."}
{"text":"Great selection and quality for fast food.  Poor service, ridiculously left their front door broken for many months on end as a slap in the face to customers, and closed hours early and opened hours late many times.  The restaurant has an absurdly tacky interior.  A shame, really.  The food, menu, and prices are great.  The last time I was there, the guy almost screamed your order number when your food was ready.  I wanted to attack him.  There is a sign that says \"Welcome to your new addiction\".  What an insulting experience.  Save your pride and go to QDoba or Pancheros to be treated like a human being."}
{"text":"Whoa!  I'm kind of surprised this place has only 2 stars?  I went here for lunch.  I had a cold beer and two tacos - one chicken, one ground beef, both soft.  We also ordered chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh and the salsa came out hot - like heat hot.  I've never had salsa served this way and I thought it was good.  Both of my tacos were tasty and I liked the garlic sauce they added to the mix.  The only thing I would change is that the place could be a little more clean.  Also, I wish I would have ordered a Dos Equis because it came in a giant cold margarita type glass.  It made my beer seem sad."}
{"text":"Great Tex-Mex food. Not authentic Mexican if that's what you're looking for. The chicken fajita was delicious. My gf had the nachos so I had to try them.  Definitely worth it and we left stuffed"}
{"text":"I think this place has the best tacos on the planet... If your drunk! Sober the taco's (tempura & grilled) are pretty good but not memorable! To be honest I've had better at Taco Bell! But I don't say this as a put down this is a good college town spot! Nothing more! They seem to have fantastic drink specials so that will keep people coming and the more of those specials you consume the better the food will get!"}
{"text":"The service here was excellent we came in with a pretty big order and they made everything pretty fast and finally a place where there wasn't anything wrong with our order. The best shrimp tacos I've probably ever had! And the salsa was out of this world."}
{"text":"This place is a dump but the good kind! Little dive restaurant with good food and drinks. Staff is welcoming and hard working. Only down fall is maybe they should have another busser on busy nights because it was dirty. Napkins, salsa, chips all over the floor! But if you can look past all of that it's a neat little place. Brisket and pork tacos are really good!"}
{"text":"Me and my family went into fuzzy taco restaurant to place a carry out order. We love trying out new food once a week at a new spot.    It was dead inside while the other restaurants nearby were packed. So we knew it would be quick to grab n go.    The service when we walked in, horrible off the back! The small man cashier just stood there staring at us, no greet or even a simple nod. Lol, like we should've left right then n there.     Since it was our first time, I asked if everything was ala carte or if they had combo meals or deals. This jerk off had the nerve to point at the menu on the wall with a smug face. Didn't even say anything, what a *****. If I wasn't starving, I would've taken off, but like I said nearby restaurants were packed.    Finally after ordering, waiting and a buzzer he gave us went off, we walked to the counter to show him it signaled us. This jerk made us walk to the kitchen window in the back to grab our own food. I asked for extra sauce and he said there should be a packet in each box. I walked to the soda machine where I saw sauce containers, sat at a table, filled up my own sauces for my to go order.     No wonder this place is doing horrible. There were 2 people at their generic bar who looked like they were getting loaded for free. And one very nice old couple who left while we left. Other than that, no one in that huge space.     Get a new staff or run your business to nothing. Your star rating already shows your current standing. I'll check back in, maybe in a month. I'll have whoever I'm with do another rating.     FOODIES: For those who are concerned about how the food tasted. We ordered a steak burrito, chicken taco combo and chicken enchiladas combo. They forgot the toppings in our burrito, avocado and sour cream (requested). The taco combo was maybe average. Enchiladas tasted healthy, unexpected. Overall freshness of food was decent. I would like to day the Buchanan (sp) beans were pretty good for beans.     I would like to say, the cook or chef who handed us the meal (when we walked to the back of the dead restaurant) was extremely nice with a friendly smile. Sad, the nicest person is probably their hardest working (the cook) kept in the back. Then they go and put some rude white guy up front who gets to make tips and ruin their business.    I wonder if the guy up front was the manager or just a cashier because I didn't see a manager up front, only what looked like a waiter sweeping around tables. If he's management then this place is in big trouble!!"}
{"text":"A large group of friends and I came here for some drinks on St Patty's Day. Considering the huge amount of people on Mill Ave, plus the huge amount of people at Fuzzy's, I was actually really impressed with being able to get a relatively clean table, and the service.  It wasn't perfect by any means, but their beers and drinks were green, delicious, the right price, and easy enough to get. I think inside there was table service, but we simply went up to the front or the bar when we needed our drinks; this kept things simple.  We did not eat, so I can't give an opinion on the food, but their pre-mixed margaritas and their green beers hit the spot! I'd definitely come back here to try it on a regular day."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something Latin authentic this is not it. I paid 14 for my meal and it was not worth it. Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch now. I'm really liking the taces. Every time I try some different meats. So far I've had the fajita tacos, the chicken, beef, the shrimp. I didn't get fish, but my coworker really liked it. I haven't had anything else here, but I am digging the tacos. The feta cheese is a nice touch, and the have regular specials that make a pretty cheap lunch. I'll be back on Tuesdays for Taco Tuesdays and $1 tacos."}
{"text":"I've only been once, just now for lunch, so I may adjust these thoughts at a later time but I definitely WILL RETURN. Not because the food was so damn great on my first visit- I had a breakfast burrito with no meat, not exactly a menu item so no surprise it didn't stand out. It also wasn't horrible and I was treated VERY WELL by the staff thereby ENSURING I will return and try some true menu items. The prices look very competitive, the selections sound interesting and the atmosphere is inviting. There's a full bar so that's a plus (maybe not on lunch from work but) and convenient location. I didn't get the guys name but I asked \"him\" for a comment card so his excellent customer service skills could be complimented. \"He\" knows who he is. Get some comment cards so we can say nice things please! Thks for lunch guys..."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Very good steak salad!  My son loved his tacos and I wanted to take them.  This is an early review as it was the grand opening in Matthews.  Will go back again for sure.  Highly recommend Fuzzy's Taco Shop!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for some breakfast tacos on Saturday morning, on a whim. The bacon, egg, potato, and cheese tacos sounded delicious! Hungry and anxious for food, we bit into our tacos only to experience raw bacon. Like get-you-sick raw bacon. Needless to say we left hungry and disappointed. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I took my family down to Mill Ave and had a good time.   I particularly like the fajita chicken along with the nachos. Cannot go wrong with $5 margaritas. The atmosphere has an earthy touch, being down on Mill that should be expected. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Service was excellent.  I guess the only complaint I have is the portion of chips and guacamole was pretty big for two people that we ended up tossing a lot of the chips.  I liked it a lot and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is Great!!!! Been going there for months and keep finding new things to try. Staff is very cool, friendly and will meet just about any request you have! Don't waste your time with a bean burito or the hard shells, hit the Grilled Shrimp and if you really want a treat, have them deep fry a pork taco or 6 for you :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have tried all of the meats and haven't been disappointed yet. This is my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's knows what it is and is successful in what it does. Relatively inexpensive Tex-Mex in a fun environment. I had the combination plate with a brisket taco, beef enchilada, mex-tex rice and charro beans. The taco was the best followed closely by the enchilada, rice and finally beans. The beans were a little bland but I corrected that with the hot sauces provided on each table. My wife had one fish and one shrimp taco. She enjoyed the fish but thought the shrimp taco was dry. I would suggest some sort of chipotle crema to improve the shrimp. The also have several kids menu options that are sure to please a picky eater. Ultimately my favorite part about Fuzzy's was the drink selection. There's something for everyone including mixed drinks, bottles and cans and my favorite, draft beer.  Some more minor criticisms include the fact that when you order chips and queso it doesn't come with salsa. This has to be asked for separately. Also, it would be nice if they started offering drink specials for different days of the week. Changing those small factors would easily increase my rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here because of a Groupon, wanted to see what it was about. Great food and loved the bar atmosphere. Shrimp burrito and brisket nachos!!! nuff said lol"}
{"text":"Everything I've gotten from here has been clutch. Enchiladas and tacos are really good.The food is reasonably priced too.  If you are ever on Mill and want some Mexican food, gotta come here."}
{"text":"Honestly, gave this is a shot purely from the relatively high stars for a delivery place...boy oh boy was it gross. Purely from a non-meat standpoint - the vegetable burrito was one of the oddest things I've ever ate. A strange sauce it was drenched in(some kind of mayo/cheese hybrid) with tons of lettuce and cabbage and onion..It reminded me of a milio's sub in a tortilla. There was no beans or expected burrito substance.. It was easily one of the most undesirable vegetarian options I've ever had. I tried some of the sides such as the potato or rice - again, bland and TV dinner quality at best. The chips were probably SADLY the highlight of the meal..and that's only if you can tolerate incredibly salty chips and salsa with very little actual flavors..besides sodium. I can think of tons of better options in Madison(El pastor, la hacienda, burrito drive, Taquira on park, Jalapeno on Midvale, even Taco Bell(lol)).  Unless the meat options are ungodly better - I'd rather eat sides at Red Lobster than eat here again."}
{"text":"We I have never been here before so we just gave it a shot. The food tasted okay but I had a chicken fajita Bowl that had about four small pieces of chicken in it."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a good friend and coworker.  It was delicious, it has a very homey, clean ambience.  The cashier name Gina was so patient and professional with us esp it was our first time dining at this place.  Heads up though, you'll get full just eating the chips and queso with is so addicting,lol"}
{"text":"Writing a review about a taco shop seems a bit stupid at first. I mean tacos are tacos right? Honestly no they aren't. There is a huge difference between tacos (or any dish really) you eat while drunk and those eaten while sober. The magic that makes a 2:30am meal taste amazing is mysteriously absent when you return with your wits about you. Herein lies the difference with Fuzzy's. I will not go into incredible detail but suffice to say that they have cured several of my usual taco pet peeves. The first thing they have done right is to put the grated cheese on the bottom so that it can melt into the meat and not just fall off. Many of the menu choices can also be had with feta cheese on top. Secondly they have gone away from the trap of \"super spicy for no reason\". Trust me that is a good sign. Ask the Creoles and they will tell you the relationship between camouflaging spicy and terrible tasting ingredients to make something edible. Instead they have chosen to used a garlic sauce that brings out the flavor of the meat rather than masking it. The final thing is that the shop owners have kept the prices very reasonable. If you go I recommend the huge iced chalice of beer."}
{"text":"My first time in and I found the menu affordable and appealing. I ordered chicken nachos to watch during the Patriots game.  I ordered a taco and an enchilada for my husband along with a chicken sandwich for him to take to work tonight.  Everything tasted great! Nice and clean and a very friendly staff.  My new go-to taco shop!"}
{"text":"Awful experience! My mother and decided to go there for Mother's day and have lunch. We sat outside under the misters to wait a few minutes before my brother would arrive.  A waiter came out us and told that we had to leave! We told the man we were waiting for someone and he said no, and that we would have to leave! We were appalled!! I wouldn't recommend this business to anyone.."}
{"text":"First time trying this place & definitely was impressed! I love the area it's in & the shop itself has a really cute beach vibe. Love all the different meat options & they have $1 taco Tuesday deals! Not to mention their $6 18oz margarita!! Yaasss!!!"}
{"text":"This has been one of mine and my partner's favorite taco shops since we lived in Colorado. The chips are always fresh and have tasty seasoning. I personally love the veggie tacos and he likes the chicken nachos (large). They have HDTVs to watch the games and tons of indoor and outdoor seating (covered patio) which makes it a great place to take friends/family from visiting out of town. But my favorite thing about Fuzzy's is their strawberry margaritas and cold beers always served in a heavy frosted glass. Sooo refreshing on a hot Vegas day! I've been here on numerous occasions and have always been pleased with customer service, quality of food, prompt service and drinks delivered to the table  Thanks Fuzzy's, you guys make me feel at home."}
{"text":"They're not the fastest, but the potatoes are tasty, the fish tempura tacos are a treat, and they serve breakfast all day long.  Even the kids like this place."}
{"text":"Styled like Dos Gringos with bright colors and the whole random stuff stuck to different surfaces - you walk in and get in the cattle drive line with a perfect view of the menu plastered to the wall. Great, easy enough. Their menu has all the basics, and the main reason to visit, SUPER CHEAP BEER!!!!   Our visit we had to wait 15 long minutes because the girl taking orders and pouring beer broke a glass into the rest of the glasses, having to cease all beer orders for what felt like forever.  I get it, shit happens, you drop stuff, but hello attitude. I even gave her a tip because I felt bad and tried to laugh it off with her, but to no avail. They never brought the beer over once it was all situated and had to hunt down someone to give us our much needed Friday fix. The food was \"eh\" - not a fan of the sauce on the shrimp tacos. Overall, I would go just to drink cheap beer - just don't make the girl behind the counter angry - then you'll never see your beer.  ***NOTE, the gal working behind the counter sent me an apology and what can I say, other than she is pretty awesome for doing that, I will come back to drown my sorrows in that pimp glass anyday!****"}
{"text":"I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars. Staff is fast and friendly. The food is just very mediocre...pretty salty and lacking depth of flavor. Guacamole was watery and bland, and the chips were coated in a salty seasoning (why??). I certainly wasn't expecting authentic Mexican fare, but I can't think of any way to describe the style. The combo of feta cheese and a mayo-based sauce on every taco is odd. I would not visit again."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this place. Atmosphere is plain, food is plain, the people are not personable at all. And really impatient. We came here with my family from out of town for my brother in laws birthday, and they seemed mad we ordered so much... Why? That's what you're here for. We're trying to enjoy our day and this place just kinda put a damper on it."}
{"text":"Very salty brisket - manager with an attitude-  Decent price for sit down fast food   They do offer a nice, little selection of beer"}
{"text":"Kind of surprised to see zero line and open tables during the Tempe Art Festival. Even more surprised the tacos were luke warm and really bland! Salsa isn't any good either. Chips were solid and their water is filtered. Crap, the water was the 2nd best thing we had. Queso dip that came with a kids quesadilla was best. Bummed."}
{"text":"Amazing place, super super clean and modern location. Tacos are amazing and fresh, they were knowledgeable in their menu and their ingredients. Amazing big parking lot and superrr friendly nice staff"}
{"text":"Found a part of a rubber glove in my tacos.  Was just given a look and oh well face.  Maybe worth an extra dollar elsewhere with no sweaty dirty rubber gloves in your food."}
{"text":"Best beer-garitas ever! They use corona. Their pork burrito is really tasty and very large. The prices are reasonable. Defiantly make it a point to order chips and cheese dip."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. The tacos are delicious no matter which ones you get. But the hard shell ground beef and the soft beef brisket tacos is where it's at. Staff is friendly and everything is always fresh"}
{"text":"If you're out looking for a bite to eat and want good authentic tacos, this is not the place to go. We ordered the shredded beef (crunchy) tacos, chips and salsa & a mango beergarita. The tacos came out and the shells are store bought shells, the beef was ICE cold & the frozen margarita tasted like pure syrup with no tequila hint or flavor what so ever (thank goodness we got the beer!). The chips and salsa were very good though! I think this place is more hip to the college kids. The atmosphere was cool and relaxed, but the food was just gross. Save yourself time and a few bucks and just hit up taco bell or a Rubios."}
{"text":"We've been to this Fuzzy's Taco Shop numerous times and the food is EXCELLENT!!! The soft tacos are out of this world and my favorite item on the menu is their Mix-Mex Rice!!! The service is awesome and the owner, Christopher, is awesome. He visits with all the customers and always makes sure everything is fine and always asks if you need anything. He is super friendly and it's very obvious he appreciates his customers. The staff has always been great. When you buy a drink, keep the cup and bring it back on your next visit and you get your next drink at a reduced price. We will definitely keep going back!"}
{"text":"For a kitschy restaurant, the food is surprisingly good! The chips are basically limitless and the guacamole was another surprise - actually quite flavorful! I got three tacos for dinner and although they look small, in total they are a well sized meal, particularly alongside the chips and guac. I feel a lot of people probably shun this place because of how crazy it can get during happy hours, but if you can look past all the weird decorations and the rather odd name of the restaurant, you're in for a pretty good meal!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fajita beef taco lunch special which the lunch special is $6.99 but they charge an extra $1 per taco so $8.99 which comes with two sides - the rice tasted really buttery and the beans were whatever. I asked for no cheese on my beans but they messed it up so I had to send it back. The drink was like $2.29 or something which I thought paying almost $12 bucks for lunch was a rip off for what they give you.  The beef in the tacos was very good though."}
{"text":"I've been to the Fuzzy's in Nebraska and was definitely more impressed. When this place first opening in Vegas I knew I wanted to try it but I wasn't too impressed.   The environment is different here. Most Fuzzy's plays a country playlist, although I'm not a big fan of country it definitely added a nice touch to the overall mood. Both times that I've been here we didn't have anyone check up on us. We always had to go to the counter to find someone. It's not even busy and we don't receive table service for little things like extra sauces, if we need anything, etc. we already have to grab our own food, utensils, drinks etc.   The food is delicious though. We usually get the grilled fish tacos, a margarita and sometimes tortilla soup, quesadilla and the California Heat taco.   The food is up to par, but the service is lack there of. You even have homeboy drinking a Red Bull as he was ringing out a customer today. A little too lax for me."}
{"text":"Fuzzys makes tacos tuesday worth it especially for all the deals. They have 5$ margaritas and 1.50 tacos. Doesn't matter if you want a veggie taco, fish taco or a pork taco they are all the same. If I had to choose my favorite it is definitely the fried fish taco.  My all time favorite dish is the bean and cheese nachos. It's super cheap and huge. Grab a few friends so you can finish it but it is absolutely delicious! Definitely worth it.  The atmosphere is usually very loud and always on the move. It can be hard to find a table especially around the evening rush. If you end up outside beware of the side by the misters. Many are broken and will just leak water all over you.   As for parking, they have abundant metered parking outside but it is often limited. So keep that in mind.  Overall, the best days for a deal are taco tuesday but be prepared for crowds and for it to be loud. Otherwise feel free to check it out whenever. It is a great staple to mill avenue."}
{"text":"Great food! We had the shrimp tempura burrito which was incredible and the chicken fajita tacos which were great too! Service was fast and the restaurant staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Foods pretty good, very americanized and good quilety. The staff are not rude but they don't smile, greet or make your experience enjoyable. We had the nachos and the brisket burrito, both good portions and tasted good. The location on rainbow needs to improve on its customer interactions."}
{"text":"Just checked this place out for the first time and I have to say it was a lot better than what I was expecting!  Wife had the spicy pork and brisket tacos and they were legit.  I had one of their burrito bowls and It was definitely better than your run of the mill  chipotle bowls.    Prices were very reasonable, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with with shredded beef tacos! They are so good and very well priced. I also love their beergaritas but they are pretty pricey. Also, they do not have a full bar which I find surprising with its location being on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the WORST experience I've ever had to get a taco.   It took exactly 26 minutes from the time I ordered until I got my cold tacos.  When I asked how much longer it would take?  The cashier complained that they were understaffed and the owner only cares about the sales figures. When there were 5 people in the kitchen!   He then proceeded to tell me \"I only make 8$ an hour, what do you want me to do?\"  The overpriced tacos were mostly filled with lettuce, salty meat, and cheese.   Just pass on this place and go to any other taqueria in town.   I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's just has a special place in my heart. It was the first place I went to on Mill when I was a freshman at ASU, and I've been going back ever since!   Let's start with the food. I love their tacos more than I love some people. They put a garlic-y sauce on them, some pico, cheese, lettuce, and the tortilla's are always so fresh tasting. I usually just get the classic shredded chicken, but their breakfast tacos are amazing as usual. They also have some amazing refried beans and the guac is pretty delicious. I would recommend going on Taco Tuesday when all the tacos are just $1.50 - it gets busy, but it's worth the wait.   Now for my favorite part...the margaritas!! My favorite is the red, white, and blue beer-Rita. It's strawberry and lime marg mixed together with a blueberry beer face down in it. It's amazing. The classic sun devil one is great as well and honestly I don't think you could go wrong with any of their beer-Ritas. They're super fun!   The atmosphere is super causal and it's a great place to go before a game. It's loud and exciting and everyone always seems to be having a great time. The service is usually fast and friendly. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! The shredded chicken tacos were so delicious, cilantro lime rice was ok. Can't wait to go back and try something else, like the Oreo churro!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, near Taco Bell prices but you don't have to buy pepto! They have great Tacos and the chicken tastes great and fresh! The hot sauce they have here is what really puts them over the top bursting with flavor and spice, highly recommend the hard shell chicken tacos!"}
{"text":"Good tacos but nothing special.  The environment says bar, let's drink alcohol. They have a large patio with table and chairs, and each table inside and outside, have bar like salt and pepper shakers, with hot sauce also. The way to get our food was odd, I felt like I was walking in the wrong area because the counter to pick up your food is like at a restaurant, very high up like to your chin and log, where you can see right into the kitchen, but you pick up your food your self.  The food was good, but nothing worth bragging about. Our order took 15 minutes to prepare, and that is no exaggeration. Our receipt said we ordered at 2:19 and we got our food at 2:37, no joke! We ordered a combo with beef enchilada and beef taco, chips and queso, and a shredded chicken salad with avocado sauce. All the food was good. Nice and hot, the queso had shredded cheese on top, with pico de gallo on the top of that, it was gooey and creamy! The chicken salad was just lettuce with shredded chicken and tortilla chips on it, not on the healthy side at all. But the avocado ranch dressing was super good (and unhealthy).  My husband had: the baracho beans: tasted like beer and runny. The chicken enchilada and beef taco: he says tasted like they WEREN'T made with love.  Overall, might go back, but not something special."}
{"text":"The tacos here at Fuzzy's are amazing and Tuesday they have an amazing deal!  But the real gem here is the California Heat.  Quite possibly one of the best tacos I've ever had!!  Get you some!"}
{"text":"Sadly I wanted to like this more than I did. Fuzzy's takes up a giant space, probably about twice as much as needed. You order at a counter, then go get your drink and take your number back to your table. They bring the food to you.   Then, if you're like me, you ask what about silverware, and they tell you it's by the beverages, so you have to go back and get it to start eating.   The food is ok, but not at all memorable. Selection is good. I ordered the taco plate with a shrimp on corn and chicken fajita on flour tortilla. I wasn't told until after I ordered (and asked), that my taco selections were an upcharge \"of $0.50 or $1 or something.\" They were $1 extra each...which is odd since a la carte they are $0.50 extra each.   When the food came out, I received two shrimp tacos on corn tortillas.  The food needed seasoning, and the hot sauce was not very hot.   Next time if I'm in the mood for tacos, I'd probably do El Valle or Qdoba (if I'm hungry) for better quality and price."}
{"text":"If you've read my previous review, I have a friend that lives out of town that visits.  I have been trying to find the best mexican for him to eat.  This last visit, we decided on Fuzzy's, honestly because the name is so hilarious.  They were advertising a new queso jalapeno cheese covered burrito.  Best big ass chicken burrito I've ever had!  I am one that can't handle much spice, but this was perfect.  Just a tiny bit of heat from the cheese, the burrito actually had taste and was thick.  I felt I didn't have enough guacamole after I had already paid and sat down to eat.  I went to the front to pay for extra guacamole (only $1.25 compared to Amados nasty crap for over $2), but only had my debit card.  The girl that helped me said not to worry about it and used her OWN tip money to pay for it!!!  I was willing to order more sour cream or something, but she said it wasn't a problem.  I was so impressed!    Now because this is only the 2nd authentic burrito I've had since living in Phoenix, Fuzzy's is getting 5 stars.  Half way through my burrito I was full, but it tasted sooooo good, I ate the whole thing.  I felt like I needed to be rolled out of there.  There are Fuzzy's in the St. Louis area (to my St. Louis friends) so I recommend you visit, and try to tell me I'm wrong about the food!"}
{"text":"This place was gross! All my tacos were cold! The shrimps were like baby canned dehydrated shrimps and they messed my order up! They gave me fish instead of shrimp for my tempura taco! I promise you it  tasted like McDonald's filet o fish! I threw it away! The chicken was ok but cold! Also the service was horrible and it was dead inside! The girl was soooo rude!! The food was just so bad, I'm mad I ate there! Places like this need a re vamp on the food quality! I have a nasty taste in my mouth! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Most recent visit was yesterday. Monday's are micro beer Mondays, $3 for a chalice of tasty treats. We go there often and are never disappointed. Recommend any nachos or tacos there. High marks on the shredded beef burrito with black beans and cilantro lime rice...splurge and get it smothered in queso. It's on Mill ave, so stay away from Tues-Sat nights after 7 if you don't like the college crowd."}
{"text":"The pork, chicken, and the California Heat tacos were great today. The cheese in the quesadilla and enchilada is fake and should be avoided at all costs. The potatoes for sides are also very very good. I had them with the chilaquiles."}
{"text":"If it were not for the cheap $1.50 taco tuesday deal I do not think I wold visit.  After a few visits I did try several tacos and reached the fallowing verdicts.  Grilled fish taco: The fish is in there somewhere under the cheese cabbage and sauce. Fish fish plays little to no role in this dish.  Tempura fish taco. That small piece of fish is pretty good under all of the cabbage and sauce, too bad there is not more of it.  Any taco as crunchy: This is the same taco shell you get at the supermarket.  Speed: Not fast, or slow assuming you beat the rush"}
{"text":"Food is bland and dry. Only thing that was decent was the red sangria.  Place was dirty and unsanitary"}
{"text":"The evening has finally cooled off down to high 70's, off to Mill Ave. we stroll.  Initially, we set out La Bocca for the great Yelp reviews--there were college girls handing out fliers for this place so we were sidetracked and decided to try it out.  First of all, really good vibe in there.  It's a walk up order so we placed:  fish taco plate with a side of rice and black beans, fish taco and shrimp enchilada plate and a kid's meal quesadilla.  Really bad food.  The parbroiled rice was undercooked, my pet peeve!  My hubby's soft tortilla was cold and crumbly...beyond the expired date, maybe?  The enchilada wasn't too bad.   My cutie pie's quesadilla was cold and the cheese was barely melted.  He took a couple of bites and decided he was done.  The imitation sour cream is one of the nastiest thing we've ever tasted...okay, one of.  We left with a weird film in our mouths.  They must cook their preservative laden food with  hydrogenated fats.  We're more sensitive to that since we eat organically at home.      Don't even tell me \"you get what you pay for.\"   Filiberto's has much better food and their prices are cheaper!    Eventhough they have great employees with upbeat service, it all comes down to...the food.  We'll pass on this place."}
{"text":"So glad to have found a bar on Mill Ave. on New Years Eve with decent drinks specials. Didn't get the food, but did 5 beers for $10. Twice. Seemed to do the trick. Otherwise, this place seemed like the run of the mill (no pun intended) boring taco shop in a college town."}
{"text":"I've been to Fuzzy's Tacos quite a few times and I've consistently had a good experience.  My go-to favorite for this place is the Taco Plate. You get two tacos and two sides for $6.49 - enough for a decent meal. I've had the veggie tacos and the tempura shrimp tacos, both very good. The chips and salsa are a sizable quantity with no skimping on the salsa.  The burritos are alright, but I suggest to stick towards the tacos. The hot sauce is sufficiently hot. I've been stuck waiting a while for my meal a few times... maybe a suggestion, if anyone at Fuzzy's is watching this: If someone orders chips, maybe they can grab those first while waiting for the other meals to come out?  All in all, a good place to get a few tacos and chips. Lots of TVs so it's good for watching sports. I'd suggest giving it a shot with a couple of your buddies when you get a chance."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Queso is amazing and the OREO churros absolutely made my entire life! Service was good once they figured out that the cashier gave me someone else's number for the table."}
{"text":"Tried this place today and thought it was absolute crap. I'll stick to Robertos, this place won't make it to the summer."}
{"text":"First time try out this taco shop. The spicy pork and grilled shrimp taco was so good. Don't order tortilla soup. It's too salty I can only go with 2 spoons. I like the spicy sauces they put on the tables too. Coulda put friendlier cashier at front."}
{"text":"My delivery order was totally screwed up. Everything tasted so good that I don't even care. I ended up with six tacos of unknown variety. I could identify the shredded beef, which was fantastic. I didn't get the ground beef tacos I ordered, but the chicken were good. Despite the $10 delivery fee, I will reorder. Delicious!  Maybe they could label their tacos? I'll ask next time I order."}
{"text":"This place is great. There tacos are amazing (shredded beef are the best) and their nachos are to die for. The staff is great with the exception of a couple cooks who spaz like they are on crack half the time. Overall, I love it."}
{"text":"I've been recommending and coming here for a few years just for the fish tempura tacos.  I've rarely tried anything else because they're that delicious. Their  $1.50 Taco Tuesday special would put me here every Tuesday forever if I were filthy rich. Enough said."}
{"text":"I just love this place so much, it was the first place I went to on Mill when my stepsister was giving me the tour. The chips and queso are phenomenal, basically worth a visit just for them alone. Have yet to try one of the beer-Rita's but as an innocent freshman who'd barely just gotten past sneaking my stepdads Coors, I was amazed to see such a creation. The atmosphere is lively and the service is usually fast!"}
{"text":"Ohhh my gosh! Thank the heavenly stars they opened a Fuzzy's in Las Vegas - If you haven't tried it already definitely DO! And this is what you need to get:   Chips and Queso with Chorizo (or without meat) Tempura Fish Tacos (flour) Shredded Chicken Nachos  Then take the \"Butt Burnin' Sauce\" sitting at your table and pour it all over everything.   Then eat to your heart's content... ENJOY!!   I can certify this is official TexMex because I went to college in Texas and the first Fuzzy's location opened up on University and Berry ... it was amazing there and it's amazing HERE!   Yay, Vegas location!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's Taco is one of my favorite taco shops for the price and they always have great flavors.  If you are on a budget stop by Fuzzy's taco and you 3 or 4 items and drink for under 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's Taco Shop has a cool name going for it but that's about all that it has going for it.  They have a lot of room in the dining room and a separate bar area where you can order beer on tap or in bottles and other assorted mixed drinks. There's even an outdoor patio.  Since they don't have carnitas tacos I ordered a grilled fish, fajita and ground beef tacos. I took one bite of the grilled fish taco and said \"no bueno\". The ground beef and chicken tacos were kind of lackluster, but passable.   I spent $11.49 for lunch on three tacos and a large soda. BTW - bring back the souvenir cup and only pay a dollar for your soda. Unfortunately, I doubt that I'll be back considering the hefty price tag and the lackluster taste to their food."}
{"text":"My daughter had the beef fajita quesadilla and said \"it was good and not like ones I've had before.\" She really enjoyed the cilantro lime rice from my plate.  My wife had the chicken salad and said \"it was like a whole, cut up head of lettuce. The chicken was good but everything else was average. There was hardly any cheese. It was good for the price.\"  I had the chicken crunchy taco plate. I think it was the same chicken they used in the salad but I wasn't excited by it. The cilantro lime rice was good as well as the potatoes which were basically country style hash browns. I could eat those all day.  The Coke was weak but their bottled water was a pretty good price.  All in all it was ok. I don't think I'm \"addicted\" but I wouldn't say no if someone wanted to eat there."}
{"text":"A note to the girl eating behind the counter, besides disgusting the customers, the health code regarding these issues is meant to protect you from putting the filth from the money you are touching into your mouth. Also, being out of tacos on taco Tuesday is just wrong. Especially with the new competition in town, that got my money tonight.."}
{"text":"The food was terrible, the only reason for the three stars is that the employees were super nice. We spent $17 for two people, and got cafeteria like food. You would be better off going to Taco Bell or Dell Taco. At least their food has flavor and you will save a few bucks."}
{"text":"It was not that great. Its set up like a Chipotle, order at the counter and then find a seat. The counter server was not friendly at all. I had to say Hi to her to get her to even greet us. The food was kinda gross. The rice and beans had no flavor. Their salsa had heat, but again no real flavor. We also tried the shrimp dippers - those were fried into oblivion - like hard little hockey pucks. I didn't even eat half of what I ordered - it was a waste of money to go there."}
{"text":"It's not that bad... The interior/branding is pretty annoying, but the tacos were decent. They have a few things on the menu for breakfast, which I may try if I'm around again.  The habanero sauce doesn't seem hot, but it sneaks up on you."}
{"text":"Great food and even better location! Lots of different items on the menu but I ordered the beef enchiladas which came with 2 sides. Couple sides to choose from but i went with refried beans and mex rice. I asked for 2 flour tortillas on the side and believe it or not there was no additional charge, which i probably shouldnt mention because now they'll start charging because everyone will ask for them. The restaurant itself isn't exactly clean, the place has a high turn over as far as customers and very little staff to clean up the tables, plus its on Mill ave which is close to the college so that explains alot. The restaurant layout is you walk in order at a counter, sit and wait for your number to be called, go pickup at a window in the back.  Not confusing to me but saw several people walk back up front to the register for their food. The quality was good for the money, and food had plenty of flavor and spice and if your not a soda drinker you can get a combo w no drink for about $7+ tax. They also have breakfast tacos which sounded excellent. Beer is also available."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The food and drinks are great. They have locations in Dallas Texas...  So excited they are In Charlotte  Come eat here great place."}
{"text":"Quirky, cheap, fun place. Super cheap draft beer.  The food is pretty good too, I like the pork tacos....  Only complaint is that their queso is a bit thin and bland....  Now, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't travel specifically to come here, by any means.  But since my office is right next door, it's my favorite go to place!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is great because they have good food and great drinks. I'm in love with the margaritas. They have several flavors to pick from and they're always a hit.  Plus, Taco Tuesday is great. $1.50 per taco. They have a delicious house sauce that is to die for.   If you're craving Baja-style Mexican cuisine, grab a Sun Devil marg and try a few Fuzzy's tacos!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their chicken and pork tacos. And their nachos are my FAVORITE. my boyfriend really like the burritos. This is always my go to taco place besides Yaquis in PHX."}
{"text":"Not the best tacos I have had but far from the worst.  Pretty good for lunch.  The service is fast and the staff are nice.  Pretty clean.  Wish they would wipe down the stuff they leave on the table better.  I have gone here several times so it is good enough for repeat visits."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in Madison, EVER. Save your soda cup for $1 refills on your next visit. Friendly staff, quick service, and the owner is a fellow Pardeevillian. I too hail from the holy place called Pardeeville, Wisconsin. :).   In all seriousness, this place offers some pretty darn good food."}
{"text":"This location is down the street from my office, so I'm a frequent customer. The staff is always friendly. Sometimes the cooks seem grumpy when you ask for hot sauce or everything is in one bag. They have made a few mistakes such as adding cheese when we ask for no cheese. This has happened on 3 separate occasions. Besides that I do love this place, brisket tacos are the best!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and will probably always love this place. It's divey and not the most attractive but that adds to the character. Just get the tacos. Don't get the burritos or anything else. They are known for cheap and tasty tacos. Get the chips with the seasoning also. And they are also known for their beer-itas. It's a blended marg with a full beer in it. It's amazing and only $6.50. If you need a cheap and easy taco and drink fix then this is your place for you!"}
{"text":"Their best dish: chicken Nachos. Just go to cafe Rio or Costa Vida, unless you just want to chill on Mill Ave and are craving some Mexican food. Burrito was a bit of a let down. Seemed they slumped out on what they could, and I wasn't loving that it just came in a plastic basket. Haha. Best part was leaving one of our random cards under their table to add to the collection."}
{"text":"Ate here for the second time tonight and love this place! It was busy and we had our food out fast!  Love the $2 drafts on Saturday!  Plan on coming back every time we are in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Took a half hour to get our food only for it to be cold and they left out the avocado out of my taco.. This place kind of blows"}
{"text":"We are Austin transplants in Madison and Fuzzy's was a little taste of home. You can imagine my disappointment when I went to get tacos today and found the store CLOSED!  I was just there a month ago and now there is a Thai restaurant in its place."}
{"text":"Food was good  But not many people in the place and we only have 1/2 of are food and it has been 30 min People that order after us have finished eating and are gone The person working behind the counter just gave us are food after 35 min and did not care at all"}
{"text":"I think I am being generous with 2 stars. I did not have any problems during my visit, I just did not care for the food. My husband and I both ordered combination plates, which come with your choice of tacos, enchiladas.. etc and choice of sides. I chose a cheese enchilada and a beef taco with beans. We also ordered chips with guacamole. Everything was not tasty. I used too much hot sauce to try to redeem the food and its lack of flavor, but that didn't work, the food was just not good.  My first visit determined there would not be a second visit.  Nothing to enjoy here in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been to fuzzys a few times and about 50% of the time there food is sloppy. I got a burrito today and the tortilla was mushy because the burrito was dripping liquid. The wrapper that it came in was soaked. They have upped their prices and the food keeps getting worse. The line is ussually long and they one have one person running the register and making drinks while I watched 2 employees come up and not help out at all. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Ok folks, having lived in Texas for a few yrs, I did have the pleasure of having a vast array of ethnic foods available at any hour. Esp Dallas. They had a Fuzzys Taco restaurant as well. And, ya never know until you try them, ..rt?!  They were, eh, so so. Nothing like what you'd find on the streets in Deep Ellum! So my bestie and I thought we'd give the new Fuzzys at Sycamore Commons a try. Ill cut to the chase here in case your reading this in hast, before running out the door to try them. Read on before you start the car dear, First sign of a questionable establishment, a lot of empty tables. Yup. But it was still early, ok, we'll continue. service was, quick, waiter was cute,... the food..... The Order incorrect, sent it back very nicely, waiter still cute food still wrong. I got my Baja shrimp looking gud!!  Tasting like last week's fresh shrimp. So freaking dissapointed, then I tried my fish taco. OMGosh. It looks like hamburger. OMGosh, it was hamburger. At this point, not worth sending back. But I did get my 2.99 back.  Thanks Fuzzys, but, you just didn't cut tha ethinaticity of Mexican food."}
{"text":"So bummed that it's closed! I was looking forward to lunch here on my visit to Madison this weekend! Loved this place"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and location, had a few drinks and dinner for under $20. Theres not a lot of places you can say that about on Mill. I will definetly be returning."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is a great place for lunch, happy hour, dinner and especially a get together with friends. I like the shredded beef or veggie tacos, but their margaritas are where it's at. Be sure to try a beer rita!"}
{"text":"I had to stop by this new taco shop in Matthews. The space is pretty large, if you have a lot of people. I know these shops are big in Texas, I tried the Baja tacos: fajita chicken, grilled shrimp, and grilled fish. My favorite was the fajita chicken, least favorite was the grilled fish. Pretty good place for simple street tacos. Nothing really wrong with this place. Good tacos, not my favorite in the Charlotte area. But good, come try them."}
{"text":"I am such a wimp when it comes to spicy/hot foods. I really enjoy Fuzzy's tacos and most of its menu items. However I was so very disappointed that I was informed yesterday that the sauces available for my order were on the table and there were no other options available. The two sauces were both labeled \"Butt Burnin'\". I asked if there was anything more mild and less 'burnin' like a salsa or taco sauce. I was told there was a more mild salsa they could it on my tacos - but they would have to charge extra. In all my years I've never heard of a restaurant- or fast food place - charge extra for sauce on a taco. A teaspoon of sauce on a taco? I could never imagine Roberto's charging extra for a mild sauce or a bit of salsa or pico de gallo on a taco."}
{"text":"I think this place is confused. I am not sure what the theme is here, it reminds me of a taco shop in San Diego, but I am not sure if they think they are a sports bar a fast food place or a restaurant. So lets go into that a little bit further.   So sports bar...the place has about 9 or 10 TVs...9 or 10 TVs that all should have been bigger in my opinion. They are all about I want to say about 40 inch TV's they should have gone a bit bigger, unless your sitting right below one, you really can't see what's on it with any discernment. And if you are sitting below one you have to look almost straight up, which makes for an uncomfortable experience. They were playing the NFL network, about the only reason this place even gets one star...but you couldn't even read the ticker on the bottom of the screen from across the isle...so in my opinion they went to small with the TV's.   The beer menu...they don't have one!!!??? The counter girl couldn't tell me what they had off hand really but did know it was happy hour and rattled off some 3 odd tap beers. PBR, Coors, and some other garbage swill...not impressed.  I wandered over to the bar area, they have a full bar, but might have gone a bit overkill with it, maybe they think their a nightclub?! I ended up ordering a Corona...12 Oz Corona $4.25 outrageous price. Happy hour at Sushi Brokers 22oz Corona $6. Better deal and its a sushi place, so literally $4.25 considering they are paying about .80 cents a piece for them is outrageous. Overpriced beer, plus the Corona tasted a bit stale, it was cold, but it seemed like it was maybe heated and then cooled one too many times. No good.   Fast food place or restaurant...you decide!!??   The seating is general seating, you walk in and walk up to the counter like its a fast food place, the menu is above your check out girl, pretty easy to read, lots of suggestions. I ordered the Chicken Fajita Burrito. THIS COMES WITH NOTHING. Chips and salsa are additional. So Chips Salsa and the beer with burrito...$14.25...where am I? Tee Pee's, Manuel's, Macayo's...with these prices I feel I should be sitting at a table and should have a waiter, not seating myself.   On a separate note, I never actually was given a receipt ever...showing me prices...HUGE RED FLAG...I only got a food ticket to show what I ordered.  So they give you a buzzer chip like the ones you get at a Cheese Cake factory and tell you when your food is ready to go to the counter and get it. OK...so about 10 minutes go by and mine goes off. Not to bad a return time, but granted it was slow considering I was the only one in the building, besides staff and this was 5pm on Friday by the way. So I walk up to grab it and get a look in the kitchen. It's dirty!!!  I mean real dirty, this place was dead but the grill looked like it had been cooked on for a party of 500, it definitely hadn't been cleaned in a minute. Not sure if I really want my customers to see that...they are definitely not True Food, even thou their prices reflect that they want to be.   So I sit down, a bit hesitant already. On the plus side the burrito is a descent size, not as big as Chipolte but bigger then Taco Bell. And it tastes OK, not great not worth $8. Chips and salsa...chips are just OK nothing to write home about, definitely had better...the Salsa...actually was pretty amazing...but they give you a huge basket of chips with one cup of salsa, not enough salsa, to many chips. So I go up to the counter and ask for more salsa. $1.29!! I also ask for some guacamole. $2.49. So almost $4.00 extra for this. My check is now almost $20!!!   I have to go back up to the kitchen counter to get it, once again this gives me time to look into the kitchen on how dirty it is. Gross. So here is the kicker thou...I get my Guacamole...charged me 3 times as much a Chipolte would or any other place for that matter. Best part, my little cup is only part guacamole, when I get to the bottom of the cup, its filled with shredded lettuce, so your not quite getting a full cup worth of guacamole, their shorting you and adding a filler. It's a rip off.   So to top off my fast food experience, as its apparent I have to put my own dishes away in a little tub above the trash along with your basket and tray. As I am doing this, some girl comes in off the street goes to the counter and asks the girl for a donation for her dead brother or something in exchange for some candy...and of course she makes a beeline for me being the only customer in the joint, and yes hits me up too. Not my idea of a good dining experience in any circumstance anywhere.  So I would give this place a half star for having the NFL network on...that's about it. But once again no half star system on yelp.  But I would not suggest going here, being in the restaurant and hospitality industry for almost 20 years, I don't expect this place to be open very long unless they make some serious changes. Not worth the experience, there is no novelty. Don't go."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos!! I went with my family, a pretty big group and a couple of the items we ordered were forgotten but it was sorted out and everyone left full and happy. There was a lot of people inside waiting in line and getting sauces, it was a little hectic but tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed was expecting something else I guess. the service is great, everyone is friendly.  Now let talk about the food, I ordered the spicy   pork burrito, it may have been alright if would heated everything up. The pork was little dry and cold , I think everything was served right out of the dish without  heating anything up, he'll the cheese was still cold.  My overall experience was okay I'm not sure if I would make the effort to stop and eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Not only is the food great, but the owner is the sweetest person on  Earth."}
{"text":"Love the tempura fish tacos at Fuzzy's.  The staff is friendly and helpful, the hot sauce is amazing, and taco Tuesday is a great deal!  Overall my favorite place to stop for tacos!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is fantastic.  I split my time between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Whenever I arrive in Vegas I usually make a trip to Fuzzy's (which is near my house) within a day or two.  The food is very good and the prices quite reasonable.  I typically get the combo plate with a grilled shrimp taco and a cheese enchilada.  I usually get the Latin fried potatoes and refried beans.  The shrimp is excellent.  Everything is fresh and high quality.  The restaurant itself is modern and airy with high ceilings and spotlessly clean.  Only thing I would say is the lighting is a bit bright, especially in the evening.  The manager, Christopher, seems to be there all the time -- clearly dedicated to his restaurant and it clearly shows.  I like it when the manager of a restaurant makes rounds and checks in with customers, etc.  Christopher does that -- he's clearly cares about running a quality restaurant.  I give Fuzzy's 5 solid stars.  I highly recommend Fuzzy's."}
{"text":"I had heard this place was really good and looked forward to trying it. Went there for dinner last night. We were literally the only people in the place, but it took a really long time for us to get our food. The chips were stale. They tasted like they had been sitting out for a week and had no salt on them.   The brisket quesadilla was SUPER greasy and not very flavorful. The chorizo queso was essentially store bought nacho cheese reheated with a few pieces of bland chorizo. The kids quesadilla and Oreo churro were not even appetizing to my 2 year old boy who will eat anything. I will not be coming back to this place. I would rather go to Taco Bell-- honestly tastes better and is a better experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since they opened...the first time was great, good food friendly service nice portion sized. This visit was horrible,  we spent about 35$ on some nachos tacos and drinks.. the brisket on our nachos was barely there and when we brought it up to the guy he didn't seem to care..one staff member was sitting miserable right in front of us on his phone while another was walking around with his drink looking miserable as well. Very disappointed and probably won't return"}
{"text":"I haven't had a shrimp enchilada like this in 15 years.  So heavenly, mouth-watering, and touch me in all the right spots.  I felt like I was on cloud nine.  The shrimp taco was fun to eat.  The black bean soup was not really a soup but a lot of black beans in a rich tasty sauce.  It was so much to eat.  I had expected more liquids and sipping on the broth but nope, not here.  There is no broth to be sipping on.  Seems to be a predominant college crowd here.  I've been here a few times.  Was unimpressed with the fish burritos the first couple of times I came."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is just fast food, and it's good fast food. Their shredded beef tacos are way better than Chipotle or Qdoba. Their guacamole is surprisingly good and their chips are fresh fried and come out warm. The ground beef tacos are bland and dry.  The real story here is the all-day breakfast tacos, cooked to order. My favorite one is the potato, cheese, chorizo, and egg. I think they're spectacular, especially with their Fuzzy table sauce, a flavor mix of tabasco and taco bell 'mild' in the best possible way. Their fish tacos also hold their own, especially compared to Tex Tubbs down the street--I think Tubbs may be the most overpriced and worst quality Mexican/Southwest food in Madison at this point.  They have a deal right now---$1 tacos after 7:30pm. We went the other night and ate like 5 tacos each; I must have gained like 4 pounds. They also have $1 margarita specials. It was an awful, salty, disgusting drink mix with a whole lot of alcohol in it. But one drink went a long way for a big buzz, so for $1 it's highly recommended."}
{"text":"Slow service great taco's!  No one was ahead of me and waited 21 min for two taco's Last week 5 people in front of me and waited 48 min for 4 taco's...someone needs to teach these people how to multitask!!!!"}
{"text":"a stop over while riding the bikes home. we remembered their drinks and cheap tacos. not disappointed in either. we got what we came for.   fish tacos...tiny bit of grilled bits of fish, but when you're drankin, it all tastes fine. what we really came for was the beer-rita's. we both had a sun devil beer-rita...a giant margarita glass, a pony corona with a few drops of grenadine and voila! gold and red, gold and red!   no wonder college kids love this area!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is the best in town. I fell in love while I was back home in Texas. And wish that we had one in Vegas. I come back to Vegas, low n behold I saw Fuzzy's Taco Shop. I was so excited that we were getting one here. When Fuzzy's open... We were there the first 3 days back to back. The food is awesome, and customer service is 110%. I will be back often. My favorite is the Brisket Salad with the ranch garlic dressing. The queso and chips are superb. Try out the fuzzy's app and earn points."}
{"text":"I'm a chips and salsa fanatic and never forget when I've had great chips and salsa. I also never forget when I've had bizarre chips and salsa. The salsa here has a very strange taste to it, unlike any other salsa I've had. They have this super hot almost tabasco style salsa as well, which is disgusting, but I'm talking about this main large bowl of traditional salsa they bring you. It is bearable, but that's it. The taste immediately always leaves me asking myself, \"Why did I come back here?\" Then I remember, the prices.  Everything is reasonably priced for a drunk college student who doesn't care about the cold food they're about to be served. Basically, everything on the plate will be cold except for the main entree, which happened to me multiple times.   The customer service given by the ladies there is always great, and the comedian / cook in the back can be pretty funny over the intercom system. Those aspects may have been five-star but overall, not enough to make up for the lousy tasting food.  Great service, good drinks, poor food."}
{"text":"Always tasty and delicious! I'm a huge fuzzys fan back home in Dallas! The soft tacos with chicken or pork are my favorite, and you can't go wrong with queso or salsa with chips (with the famous Fuzzy dust!)  This location seems to take a little longer to get your meal, and the service is not as welcoming as the Dallas locations. I also think they could have more outdoor space! Set up is kind of weird."}
{"text":"The guacamole was great, but the tacos were stone cold, I asked for NO feta and they had feta all over them, and the two of the tacos had avocado rind mixed in. Top off the experience with an employee leaving the women's restroom and not washing her hands yet she headed straight for the kitchen. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, good queso, 2 types of salsas: roasted and cold and the best part is their amazing beeritas! Such a good deal. Love this place but too crowded on Taco Tuesdays.   Ps. I hate the patio chairs. They take too much room and are tough to move around as needed in the cramp space"}
{"text":"First trying this place wanted to explore new options sense I live close by, I Got the taco plate 1grilled fish soft and crunchy shredded chicken with a side of black beans and potatoes, Im a fan of beans so they def hit the spot they were very flavorful. I didnt really care for the potatoes that were recommend but there tacos were so good I forgot about them so next time I will be sure to get double beans or try a new side and tacos are a must yummmy"}
{"text":"I really like this joint. It feels a lot like California to me and that's always a great feeling. It's pretty big and it's really clean!  I had the California heat tacos and that was amazing!! They also have a bar there if you are looking to throw a few back."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is the best! It's the only true Tex-Mex restaurant I've found in the Valley.  Side note: My wife and I went to TCU in Fort Worth, TX, which is where Fuzzy's got its start. The original location on Berry Street (pretty much on campus) was basically our second home. Since we moved to Henderson, we've sorely missed the Tex-Mex we loved so dearly. Fuzzy's has now filled that culinary void in our lives   My Fuzzy's faves include: chips & queso (preferably with chorizo), chicken nachos, pretty much all of their tacos, chicken and beef fajitas, the enchilada platter, pretty much all of their breakfast tacos, and their sopapilla chips. Plus, I was elated to learn that the Vegas location has Shiner Bock on tap. If you've never heard of Shiner Bock, give it a try - you won't be disappointed! It's one of the best beers to come out of the state of Texas - ever. No joke.  This restaurant is in an awesome, brand new shopping complex, and it's exceptionally clean and modern. It's quite spacious, too, and it's got an awesome patio - perfect for our mild \"winter.\" The staff is super friendly, and the owner / manager, Christopher, is an awesome guy. If you have a question or an issue during your visit, he'll go out of his way to make it right.   If every restaurant was run the way he and his family run Fuzzy's, the food world would be a much, much better place!  GO TO FUZZY'S RIGHT NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's taco shop! My husband and I went there to have dinner, I had the taco plate, it was absolutely delicious. I ordered refried beans, but they brought regular black beans. I asked the lady if that was just regular black beans or refried beans and she said,  \"well it's regular black beans, did you order refried beans?\" And I said, \"I did but it's OK I'll try the black beans.\", and she was so apologetic she said \"oh no that's OK, are you sure?\" And I said, \"it's really OK, I am happy to try the black beans since I haven't been here before.\" And we got our food right away, we got a regular margarita and it was delicious, it was so good. The prices are amazing and the food is so delicious and so fresh; meanwhile the waitress came back and brought me a free refried bean dish to try because she felt bad. She was very apologetic and went above the norm.  It was so delicious and she was so nice everyone was so excited and happy to be working there and serving there.  I cannot wait to go back and I give them 6 stars."}
{"text":"1. Feta cheese on tacos is interesting once but don't care to do it again. 2. \"Salsa\" is Vinegery.? 3. Chicken and beef pretty bland."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but who's doing the cooking in this place? That was the blandest mexican food I've ever had!   Dirty tables and silverware. The house margarita was watered down,  chicken was dry.   Not coming back here for food again!  Only thing with flavor was the mango margarita. .  Shape up people and quit hiring college kids as cooks. For God's sake. Taste your food people!"}
{"text":"Great service, but the food was BLAND and boring. I had chicken tacos (bland, flavorless), Potatos (dry and bland), Black beans (runny, but ok)  my son had nachos (white queso and ground beef... that's it!)   Waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Customer service is great, food is cheap and delicious. Crispy shrimp tacos are the best so are the Oreos churros"}
{"text":"We love this place.  After using our Groupon for it we haven't stopped going since.  About 3 times a month we patron this fun family Mexican restaurant.  Kids love it and there enchiladas are out of sight, awesome delicious.  Great people who work there, too. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's just rocks. After the one in my local Albuquerque closed, we needed our fix on a recent road trip and stopped at the one in Tempe. Nom nom nom!  We went with the usual chicken tacos and the cashier recommended their special beef taco which was a good recommendation. Their chips and queso can't be beat. It's not spicy like I like it but it's full of flavor and the chips come with yummy Fuzzy's dust.   Although putting feta on tacos sounds totally weird to some people, after Fuzzy's I practically can't imagine it without. We didn't have the cashier's specialty frozen margarita which looked amazing but it was cheap and people were ordering them like crazy.   For cheap eats, good tacos and a super fun, casual atmosphere you can't beat Fuzzy's. I hope that they come back to Abq.  My faves on the menu- chicken soft tacos, chips & queso, and their fajita chicken salad. With any of those, you just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is my neighborhood taco shop and I absolutely love it. The service is so friendly and the menu is simple (and huge)! Also, it is ridiculously spacious inside, making it super easy to take the kids. Delicious food and super easy! Try out their brisket nachos and thank me later."}
{"text":"As a crabby ASU alumni, usually the thought of anything Mill-related is highly unappealing. However, I was mostly satisfied with my visit to Fuzzy's. When I was there it was pretty clean, it was inexpensive, and the food was ready fast.  I ordered a vegetarian sandwich. I'll admit it was a little weird to eat a sandwich that had the filling a burrito normally would have, but I still liked it. I did not get a drink when I went, but I would be interested in trying one another time.   I would be glad to try this place again, but I would probably order tacos or something instead!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is not only some of the best Tex-Mex in Tempe, it's also the most affordable. Taco varieties are varied but you can get away with a decent meal for about $8 top to bottom, including drink and tip.   However, Fuzzy's offers deals on every angle. Come on Tuesdays and tacos are only $1.75 each. Buy a large drink and the reusable cup gets free refills forever. They occasionally have \"Dollar Taco Days\" which are as awesome as they sound.   The service is as fast as can be expected, but the place tends to get noisy at peak hours. You come to eat, not to chat. Thumbs up for Fuzzy's! See you on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"After receiving very poor service at another restaraunt (never got help for 18 minutes after being seated) my buddies and I ride out to Mill and ended up stopping at Fuzzy's Tacos. it was fast, the people working were very friendly and nice, and the shredded brisket tacos were amazing! I don't think I would go on a weekend because of how busy it would be but my wife and I DID go the very next night. Awesome and highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's been a while since a new restaurant has exceeded all of my expectation. The food is superb, the service is friendly and FAST! And the prices are quite reasonable. Can't wait to work our way through this menu because we will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Ordered the crispy brisket tacos. Looked like cheap store bought shells. Prices were a little high. $11 lunch."}
{"text":"First off, food was very good. Lots of flavor.   However, the portion seemed pretty small compared to what I was seeing on yelp reviews. I attached both for comparison. For the price I expected a little more food.   If the portion size gets better, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype surrounding Fuzzys, and I was nearby, so I decided to finally see if it lived up to it. And well, the girl at the front counter was very nice, and gave me a good rundown on some of their most popular items, the service was fast, the prices are average, but the spicy pork burrito was pretty middle-of-the-road. I may have to try their tacos sometime, but as it stands, my taste buds don't water at the mention of Fuzzys. The meter parking surrounding it is a pretty big turnoff (not their fault but...), so Cafe Rio seems like a more viable option."}
{"text":"Great for late night drinking and taco eating. Otherwise, there are much better places."}
{"text":"I had the ground beef nachos and the meat was cold. It looked dry even with the toppings no salsa on the side just a cheese sauce and I can taste the reused oil that the chips were fried in. Not my cup of tea"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for an order of 2 pork tacos at lunchtime on a Saturday even though the place was not busy. And the \"spicy\" pork is not spicy--I covered it in a large dose of hot sauce. Cilantro rice is good, though. And it was very reasonably priced--lunch, including soda for $8."}
{"text":"I wonder if the quality of food suffered because it was a busy taco Tuesday when I visited this joint. The wait to get my food from waiting in line, to ordering, to walking out the door with it was nearly 45 minutes, and it was lukewarm at best. Nothing about the flavor of the food stuck out to me and I don't know if I'll head back any time soon. People watching was on point, however."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in town! My husband and I love the Fuzzy's in Colorado and we're super excited for it to be here in Matthews. Definitely have to get a margarita. My favorites are the ones with champagne. Do yourself a favor and get the chicken burrito slathered in green enchilada sauce. By far the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday with a friend. MMMmm good! I ordered the steak fajita quesadilla. It was actually good quality chargrilled skirt steak. Not like the bland  itty bitty mincemeat somewhere like Filibertos serves. He ordered the steak fajita burrito. Oh My! It was so huge he could barely finish it! We shared the queso dip. It was my really good. It was white, creamy and flavorful. I favor white queso dip over the nasty yellow/orange queso dip that some restaurants serve. Everyone from the register to the kitchen cooks were pleasant and cheery. We will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food 16 beers on tap first time here and I will for sure be back. Only thing that was not 100 was the counter guy didn't really seam to be happy to be at work, for us being there for our first time we had to figure the menu out our selfs. Other then that legit place lots of seating and good music I will be bring my club here for a meet soon! Cheers"}
{"text":"This isn't your authentic Mexican restaurant, but the food that they offer is pretty good. My favorite item to order is the shrimp enchilada plate. The prices are pretty good for the most part. I think they have taco specials on Tuesdays too."}
{"text":"Just had a late lunch/ early dinner here.  Service was fast and friendly, and the food was good!  I got the two taco plate and my husband just got two tacos.  We shared chips and salsa, which were exactly what I needed.  I loved the seasoning on the chips.  Next time I'm not getting the plate, just the tacos.  Was a bit too much food and the sides were fine, just nothing special.  We are definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Been to Fuzzy's several times - what ASU student hasn't?! It's honestly great for a cheap meal - the food isn't particularly outstanding, but it fills you up and it feels good going down. You can get a huge margarita or beer for about $5 (or less - I can't remember the exact price), and you have to try one of their signature beer-ritas at least once (they stick a mini bottle of Corona upside down into your margarita)! The Sun Devil beer-rita is my favorite - the mango flavor is awesome.   There's a little bit of inconsistency with how the tacos are made - I've gone some times when they've been very dry and light on toppings, other times when they've been so overflowing that I literally can't pick them up, and others when they've been just right. You can't complain too much for what you're paying. Taco Tuesday is discounted tacos - be ready to wait 10-15 minutes in line! Ample seating, though, so don't worry about getting a table.   Fuzzy's for the win!"}
{"text":"Killer burritos. Great drinks. Ehh  tacos.  It's a pretty chill place and fun to visit for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm frequently in town for work and this place is within walking distance.  Of course, when I'm in a new town I plan out my culinary treats via Yelp.  I seriously could not imagine travel without it.  I had to say I when I set my eyes on nachos with feta and garlic sauce, I knew I had to experience it.  But what came out was cold and I left most of it on my plate.  I was hoping for a creative masterpiece and it was more like a paint by numbers done by a blind person.  I think the positive reviews must be by college kids who have not developed a refined palate or the jungle juice has dulled their senses.  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting gourmet and I get down with dives...but seriously, at least flavor your chicken and heat your food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I love this place! Both times, I have gotten either fish or shrimp tempura tacos and they are fabulous. I would recommend the Borracho beans (at least I think that's what they're called) if you like beer- pinto beans cooked with bacon in Miller beer. Depending on what you order, or how hungry you are, it costs somewhere between $7-$10 to eat here. And the food is really really good."}
{"text":"Awesome Brisket Quesadillas. The Shrimp Tacos are the bomb and the beer is ice cold."}
{"text":"Love this place. I was hesitant at first as I'm not a big fan of Mexican food so I never gave it chance. I'm glad I did. The chips and queso is so cheesey I live for that stuff! Try their tempura shrimp tacos! Soooo good! My husband loves their burritos and the drunken pig! We'll be back!  UPDATE: let me make this as clear as possible... cause I've still heard people say oh this place isn't that great. It's as \"White American Mexican\" as you can get. Which for someone like me, is the best of both worlds. Do not come here looking for authentic Mexican food because its not that. Their food is really good but make sure you know what your ordering and what comes on it."}
{"text":"This was a terrible meal! I had the shredded chicken Baja tacos. I asked for crispy tacos and I'm not sure if they gave me the wrong thing or just made it badly. They used small flour tortillas. The meat was room temperature. Very salty and reminded me of taco bell quality, but they add feta cheese. The refried beans and Mix-mex rice were worse. Instant rice and apparently canned beans.   $10.04 for a gross two taco combo with a fountain drink. The staff at the registers was polite and did a good job.   Definitely would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"At first I was a little skeptical about this place, but after Charlotte and Tristan's great customer service it changed everything for me! They recommended me California heat which turned out to be lit! Like literally lit! It's a phenomenal place to eat overall! Thanks again y'all I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So I decided to stop here for a taco Tuesday since I heard they have pretty good deals and I must say it's a pretty good value for what you get. On Tuesday they have $1 beef, chicken, and spicy pork tacos and you can get it on soft, corn, or hard shell tortilla which is nice. Most taco deals really limit you , however Fuzzy's has a nice little selection. The tacos were filled with meat which I thought was a excellent thing and 3 tacos made me pretty full.   The establishment is clean and they have friendly team members and they have tv's which is a plus if you want to catch a game. The environment has a great chill vibe and you can go there with a group and enjoy yourself and if you plan on being loud there is a patio to use as well. Matter fact behind me there was a lady who was having a party all by herself and it was pretty funny, if I didn't have to run I would have joined her because she was really enjoying her own company.   I would definitely come back on a Tuesday and enjoy the $1 tacos and next time I go I will be sure to try some other stuff on the menu. Oh and know that when your order is ready you take your buzzer up to the kitchen and pick up your own order, that was a little confusing but kinda cool at the same time"}
{"text":"Baja delicious! Perfect lunch spot when you're craving tacos. The California heat taco is my fav--small but satisfying. Good chips and queso too! Their prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly. I wish they had a location near me!"}
{"text":"Well, another miss in our search for great Mexican food in Vegas. Service is good but the food is nothing to rave about.   We're always in search of good Mexican food in Las Vegas and decided we had to give Fuzzy's a try. I should've known that it wasn't going to be very good when we checked out their website and they were advertising a sandwich. Not exactly a Mexican food staple. The establishment was very clean but I would expect it to be since it's pretty new. The food in itself wasn't very good. A few things that led to my lower rating are listed below:  1) Salsa wasn't really salsa, basically tasted like Cholula hot sauce.   2) Tacos were very flat and lacked substance. See the attached picture.   3) Enchiladas were very sparsely filled with meat and very small in size.   4) Flavor of the dishes was not at all authentic and reminiscent of canned enchilada sauce.   Yes, as a Texas girl my standards of Mexican food are pretty high. This place is cheaper in cost than most of the Mexican restaurants in Vegas but I can't give it more stars because of the cost itself. Sorry this place just wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"It's average. Nothing special about this place. Very Americanized place. Not authentic Mexican. Shredded chicken burrito is ok. The tortilla on the burrito tasted like packaged tortillas. Tacos are hard shell and taste like the shells you buy at your local grocery story. I think Taco Bell has better hard shell tacos than here. There was not a whole lot of combo plates to choose from. They see lots of item individually and you have to pay for the almost $3 drink on top of your plate. Not the worst but I wouldn't come here again with other spots to eat nearby. They do have awesome staff and a great beer special."}
{"text":"Fianlly got to try this place it was delicious. We tried a few spicy pork hard shell tacos, chicken hard shell, beef hard shell, and some Oreo churros. The flavors of all the tacos were delicious, especially their garlic sauce. They are not stingy on toppings or meat either so your tacos come fully loaded. A dash of fresh cut limes and some of their hot sauce is the perfect flavor train. Not to mention the $1 taco Tuesday deal is the bees knees. Great friendly atmosphere and staff here as well. Another bonus is if you have kids is it's very kid friendly with lots of booster seats and high chairs available. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This review is for their \"Taco Tuesday\" - $1.50 selected tacos.  I ordered 3 tacos - all crispy.  I tried the roasted vegetable (my favorite!!), the tempura fish (pretty good), and the beans and cheese (just okay).  The service was quick and the food was good and very inexpensive.  I'll definitely be back for a quick & cheap lunch!  Great vegetarian tacos at an awesome price!"}
{"text":"I had heard of the Fuzzy's Taco Shop from people in Texas so while out here we wanted to give them a try. The one in Tempe was awesome bit is the perfect college town joint. I wish we had one in Arlington, VA. I might just have to become a franchisee! I loved the super casual/relaxed atmosphere. During the day family friendly and I can see it turning into a hot spot at night.   The menu has a great variety and the prices are cheap. We ordered a ton of food and it was $35. I had a grilled fish taco and a brisket taco, both on flour tortillas. I loved them both. My husband ordered chips with \"the drunk'n pig\". For our 6 year old daughter we selected nachos with cheese. My suggest is this... Put  he cheese sauce on the side. Kids love to dip and they hate soggy chips. Cut the portion in half and serve it with the carrot sticks and a churro. We also tried the Oreo churros. They came out hot and were interesting, but not something we would order again. Very sweet.   They have a full bar and several margarita and beer options. Great for the college crowd."}
{"text":"Your basic \"tex-mex\" restaurant at a great price. For five bucks I got two tempura shrimp tacos (decently sized), and a chalice of dos equis.  Service was friendly and fast. The employees seemed like they were having \"responsible fun\" with their positions. Enjoying their jobs while making sure they took care of their responsibilities.   If you go make sure you get one of their \"Frequent Muncher\" cards to get yourself a free shirt after 10 visits.  Overall... I have 5 punchs on my card, and I can tell you out of the 5 times I've been there, only once I was disappointed, and it was only because it was so busy."}
{"text":"Today was my second time here, my first time here, food was cold so I didn't have high expectations for this time around.....repeat trip today was definitely worse! My husband said I needed to keep my order basic...seriously....I ordered an egg/bean/cheese taco (Good Friday) pretty basic right???  I've included a pic of my freezing cold food. Three of my family members orders were all wrong and cold. Chips and queso was cold. Bye Fuzzy's"}
{"text":"Overlooking the fact that this chain started on the campus of TCU, and TCU just beat the Badgers in the Rose Bowl, this place was just fine.    Fuzzy's has locations throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and Texas usually knows what it's talking about re: Mexican food so I thought I'd give this place a try.  I got the taco plate dinner, which features two tacos and two sides.  I chose the crispy fish tacos, and they did not disappoint.  The fish was perfectly seasoned, grilled and moist, accompanied by a lightly spicy mayo-based sauce, iceberg lettuce, fresh ripe diced tomatoes, and a heaping load of cilantro.  The flavor was good, though the tacos were somewhat small.  For my two sides I chose refried beans and fried potatoes.  The refried beans were adequate, moist, and topped with shredded cheese that melted.  The potatoes were diced, generously seasoned, and prepared like American Fries.  They tasted good, and even better when topped with Fuzzy's signature hot sauce, which is provided at each table.  However, I didn't find the hot sauce, labeled as butt-burnin' (gross?), to be all that hot, but it still tasted fine.    Overall, I am used to finding more food on my plate at Mexican restaurants, though what I had tasted good and I would come back to try something else.  Hopefully the place will still be around then.  I was the only person eating here for lunch, because it's early January and most of the students haven't returned for class yet.  The restaurant is also located a non-walkable distance west of campus, along a retail strip that also includes many other restaurants and businesses.    Compared to other Mexican/Southwest fare, I'd say Fuzzy's is better than Taco John's/Taco Bell, on par with Q-Doba and Chipotle, but not as good as Tex Tubb's or Pasqual's, which are local and located down the street.  In terms of menu variety, though, it has Q-Doba and Chipotle beat."}
{"text":"Awful. Not one positive thing to say, would rate as zero but no can do. Slogan should be Frozen, Foul, Failure."}
{"text":"Now I am not new to the fuzzies tacos franchise. I frequently visited the one in Oklahoma City and I was a huge fan. I came here on a whim because I heard on Tuesdays it is $.99 tacos. So as soon as I walked in I was greeted by the manager who told me to give him a little bit, surprisingly it was pretty busy for a Tuesday afternoon.   Now the options were either shredded chicken, pork, or ground beef. What I'm use too is the option of flour or corn tortilla, then the normal fuzzy fixings (lettuce pico feta garlic sauce and cilantro). Now I can't say if they were exactly what I'm use too because....when they gave them to me they were completely falling apart when I opened them up. It's like whoever made it, just threw some things on a tortilla rolled it a bit and wrapped it in aluminum foil. I was a little off out but that only because I had to eat it on the go and most of the filling was coming out. They were pretty inconsistent in flavor too. Some had more cheese some had more lettuce some had barely any cilantro. I was disappointed in that as well. But even though they were made shitty the flavor was still pretty good. I appreciated it the extra hot sauce in my bag too. Service was quick and efficient. I mean they did actually make it and get it to me quickly. They just.....didn't execute it that well? I will come back. Maybe it was a busy day. Maybe it was just an off day. I won't completely give up on one of my favorite margarita spots (which are 5 bucks by the way) for a few lousy tacos."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa 3 out of 5 - salsa has a slight marinara taste.   Breakfast burrito 5 out of 5. Loved it!!!  Brisket quesadilla 4 out 4. REALLY good!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy food!!! I'm a Texas girl and I love Fuzzys!!! The Matthews Location hasn't disappointed! Friendly employees and the Rita's are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Fuzzy's Tacos....Not too bad! It was borderline 4 stars. I would first like to point out that this is not a traditional taco joint, which in some aspects in not the worst ordering situation in the world. Talk about trying something original, right! I ordered the Chicken Baja tacos along with the Borracho beans with the Fuzzy Taco signiture plastic cup.  The tacos were original and huge. The chicken was topped with what seemed to be feta cheese with a galic/lime sauce and covered in pico. Pretty tasty. The bad: The chicken was not seansoned well.  I do have to say one thing I look for in taco joints, is if I can fit the taco in my mouth or not......turns out this taco was huge, not a chance! A+ for that.  The Borracho beans.....pinto beans in alot of beer, were tasty, but the beer/beans ratio was 50/50 so not much to eat. Mostly warm beer to stare at when I was finished.  Buy the Fuzzy's cup, if and only if, you plan to frequent this place! refills anytime in the cup are $1, and it is a pretty large sized cup ( I would guess a little over a pint).  A good lunch joint. As for if this place decided to start bumpin'.....well I imagine your wait time would be horrible.  I would also like to point out Fuzzy's has a very nice outdoor seating area!"}
{"text":"At best this is public school cafeteria food. It was pretty terrible. The crispy taco shells are store bought. The rice had no flavor. I would not be surprised if the \"ground beef\" came out of a can or something."}
{"text":"I love this place. Awesome food and cool atmosphere. Beer is good and cold."}
{"text":"Man... I'm not really a \"yelper\", so something really needs to inspire me to write a review... And let me tell you - I'm inspired. There is a palpable energy in this little taco shop from the moment you walk in the door that these people GENUINELY want you to leave with a smile on your face. They're REAL, no scripted greetings here. Then you see the ridiculously reasonable prices and the VERY respectable draft beer menu. 4 bucks for an 18oz import? Yep, I love this place already. I went with the \"brisket nachos,\" which were recommended to me after I told the cashier that I was hungry enough to eat a horse... And let me tell you - I was not disappointed. An absolute MOUNTAIN of briskety goodness topped with heaping amounts of guacamole, sour cream, white nacho cheese, jalapeños, and other delectable toppings that I was too busy scarfing down to even take in were flying down my gullet faster than a Japanese Bullet Train and before I knew it - I was in complete bliss with an empty plate in front of me and a FROSTY Dos XX to wash everything down. Great quality food, great beer and even BETTER service - Fuzzy's Taco Shop, WE WILL MEET AGAIN."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have ever had.  The staff was actually mean.  One of the women, Kaylee actually yelled at me.  First off, the staff who took our orders were so rude and you could just tell they did not want to be there.  I didn't even want to ask what the taco Tuesday special was. Then, my friend has a shellfish allergy, so he asked if they could let the cooks know.  The guy comes back and says that they cannot do that because it will take an hour to clean.  So he refunded my friend.  We waited for about 50 minutes for my order, when I go up and check, I see they made my friends order.  I told one of the cooks that they already refunded us, and he told me to just take it.   Kaylee comes over and I ask her if my order was missing.  She asks me for my ticket, but they gave a pager.  She asks about the other food on the table and then proceeded to yell at me saying that she was calling out that shellfish allergy order for awhile.  I tried to explain that we weren't listening because it was refunded and we didn't think they would make it.  She tells me that she told  the cashier guy they could accommodate the shellfish order. Okay? Well, I'm still waiting on my order, we aren't stealing $1.50 tacos.   She goes and checks with the people at the register to see if we were lying I guess?  Then to top that abuse off, she tells me they lost my ticket.  After she realises that we weren't lying she starts to be nice.  I just got my refund and left.  I didn't go out to eat to have the staff treat me like garbage.  I am sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"Mah, this place is just very okay. Food was super quick and staff was friendly enough but the food was mediocre, small portions and bland. The salsa tasted like Pace to me.  My friend got the fajita bowl and was underwhelmed with the Quality and quantity. He left hungry. My taco salad was served in a big bowl, but not memorable.  I'd say skip this place."}
{"text":"If you're coming here for anything other than tacos or queso and chips you're doing it wrong. I've tried the shredded pork burrito and shredded beef salad and been disappointed both times.   On taco tuesdays though, Fuzzys is a great deal with $1.50 tacos and $7 beer-ritas. The tacos are pretty good but they do come with a garlic sauce that usually ask them to hold. As for the beer-ritas the ironman is my favorite, try it if you like your drinks a bit sweeter.   Tip: Don't come here too hungry because you're almost always going to have a long wait. If you're waiting in line though you can download the Fuzzy's app which gets you a free drink when you download it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Its great for quick food that is yummy. I get the shrimp tacos and they are so delicious. I would recommend the shrimp tacos over the chicken or the pork. The prices are good too."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for me to give this place 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed the food and the service is excellent. The price you pay is very fair and the restaurant is very clean.   I don't know that I would call the food authentic, so if you want really authentic Mexican food it would probably be better go to Tacos El Gordo or Lindo Michoacán. I actually prefer Fuzzy's to either of those, but if you must have really authentic Mexican food, then maybe there are better options.   Lastly, I would prefer to not see Fox News on the television when I'm out for dinner. I'm pretty sure roughly 50% of the clientele would also prefer to not see that as well. Even if that number is a little less than 50%, I don't see it wise to alienate 35-50% of your potential customers.   All in all, I'm a fan of this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for something to eat after a movie late at night and we wanted something cheap. We found fuzzy's and loved them instantly! We both had a delicious all day breakfast burrito and the prices were not bad at all! Definitely coming back since it's also on mill ave!"}
{"text":"This place is nice! Tacos, wow. Alcohol drinks don't have much alcohol, they would be okay for young children since there is little alcohol"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is an institution! My friends and I love coming here on Taco Tuesdays and late at night. Tacos are cheap and always good. (I love the baja chicken with their hot sauce! You also can't beat the nachos.) Margaritas are pretty sugary, but huge.  It is a fun atmosphere and you can guarantee you will run into people!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! I went there many times already and im happy that its close to my house this taco place. They have a patio outside and its great,when the weather is good you can enjoy the delicious tacos outside. I like chicken tacos,but the steak and carnitas are also good. The customer service was great every time!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat on Mill. My friends and I go here all the time.  I mean, it's not gourmet or anything, so don't expect more than you're paying for, but for being as cheap as it is, it's great. Fun, lively atmosphere, and the workers are very friendly. I usually get the chicken tacos or the vegetarian salad (you can get salsa as a dressing, which I like!). Chips and salsa/cheese are also good. I don't get the garlic sauce or cheese (or feta) on anything because I don't like it, but that's just me.  Again, don't expect anything fancy, but it's a nice place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome great service and great food the owner even came to our table and conversed with us gave us there brisket nachos on the house I'm definitely come back here."}
{"text":"We ate in and the food was just alright and very bland, one person we were with waited about 45min for one order of nachos because I guess they for got to make it??? The place wasn't very busy so I'm not sure what the hold up was. We will not be returning here there are far better restaurants in this same area. Everyone that rated this 5 stars are full of shit and either work there or know the people that own it FYI."}
{"text":"A go if you are close!! The tacos are street taco style and the burritos are quite large and getting it in smothered in queso was a good call. Go go go if your in the areA!"}
{"text":"Honestly don't know why everyone loves this place? The Yelpers below me must be drunk when they went here... Food sucks, prices are too high for quality of service and the people cooking the food look like convicts recently released from Tent City."}
{"text":"Came here because of a Groupon wanted to see what it was about. The name made me a little fuzzy at first. Came in and it looked ok. Place my order with the guy at the counter that didn't seem to happy to be there. Was never greeted hello hi nothing just what did you want to order. So as I'm browsing the menu I order the chicken fajita plate but than immediately changed my mind to the faijita salad. He didn't seem to happy about that either me changing my order. So I ordered chips and queso they handed me the basket of chips so I can take it to my table and a buzzer so I can pick up my own food at the window.  Not sure what that tip jar at the counter was for since it was self serve. And they weren't very friendly to begin with. But hey. I guess that people these days and it seem like that every where I go.  1 star really because the salad is so sad only maybe 2 oz of chicken and the whole thing lettuce, plain salad nothing to pay $8 for. My daughter did like her cheeseburger quesadilla. Over all not coming back. Even with a Groupon"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food great service great vibes. The gat ages were always full and the tables look sorry though. Only complaint, otherwise I eat here all the time"}
{"text":"We tried Fuzzy's for lunch and had a chicken fajita burrito bowl and a taco plate (with rice & refried beans) + a side of chips (just a buck). Our food came out really fast, but overall it was just okay. Nothing was bad, but we were underwhelmed in general--being a chain from Texas, I had higher hopes. For a quick taco spot, I'd much rather go to Sabor.   We liked the atmosphere and decor (like someone else mentioned, it reminded me of Chuy's) and the staff was super friendly and willing to answer our questions while ordering. Will give them another shot since it's so close to home & they have schooners!"}
{"text":"Ordinary, had fish burrito, fillers - bean, rice, and two small pieces of fish. Taste ok, ordinary, nothing special. I saw that in a couple photos too (skimp amount of primary protein ) , I'm willing to try again, maybe other things. We'll see."}
{"text":"Had read an article about this restaurant and it made me eager to try it.  I was expecting something a little more authentic Mexican, something significantly different than Chuey's or Moe's or Chipotle.   Well, the verdict is that it was basically the same old same old.  It was an order at the counter place where you take the number to the table and wait for the food.  Whatever.  They DID have a bar with a lot of beer on draft and a lot of pre-made frozen margaritas spinning around in the machines.  The atmosphere was bright and lively, a bit like Chuey's.   My impression is that this would be a great place for a family with kids who are looking for a fun atmosphere and are not discriminating with their food.  I had a fajita chicken burrito bowl that was served in a disposable cardboard bowl.   There was nothing special going on in that bowl. The beans and rice were luke warm, as was the chicken.  The salsa on top was just so so.  If I were a teacher and had to give a grade, it would be a C.   Oh, this looks and feels just like a chain restaurant.  If you like chains and Tex Mex, this may be your place.  For me, not so much."}
{"text":"This place is poo! Their jumbo Burrito should be called baby Burrito. Over priced by way too much. It's total trash! And the new id law is stupid!"}
{"text":"Fuzzy tacos is pretty good ! Fresh ingredients , good customer service . Chicken nachos were huge and delicious .. my daughter liked her chicken quesadilla ."}
{"text":"Super slow service and the food was so-so. Great place if your a student with lots of time to study and not a lot of cash on you."}
{"text":"Unbelievably amazing! Prices are not very different from Robertos if anything this is cheaper and 10 times better."}
{"text":"I come here just about every Tuesday for their amazing Taco Tuesday special. just $1.50 for all (except one) taco and it never disappoints. Lifehack: when the line is going out the doors (which is every Tuesday), go sit at the bar. You can order food from there and skip the long line.   I love their margaritas and beer-ritas which is a beer bottle upside down in a margarita. I feel like the Belle of the Ball carrying those from the counter to my table. I always get their fish tacos, both grilled and 'tempura,' and between the different cheeses, the spices in the fish, and the meaty juices it's fantastic. Don't forget about their awesome burritos too.  My one gripe is sometimes when I get tacos to go, they get messy and the tacos look like they got ran over, or a salsa/sour cream container is leaking in the bag. So I try to eat there if I can."}
{"text":"I had Enchilada plate with two pork enchilada and Mexican rice. Enchilada was good, rice needed cook more. Overall, it was good Mexican food. Their service is good, price is decent. I saw really long line came out from their front door, I guess their business is good."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is really nice. I think the prices are good for the amount of food you get. I did have a couple of problems with my last visit. The first was that when my shredded chicken nachos were done being made and I was paged to come get them, they were kinda cold. They're weren't sitting there long. A minute at most. And it wasn't like they were room temperature, they were cold. Like the were just taken out of a fridge. The friend I had gone with said that her rice wasn't even cooked all the way. My second and last problem was that there was a hair in my food. Normally I would excuse it as being my hair, but this time I couldn't do that. My hair is pretty much black as night and when I went, my hair was about an inch long. The hair that was in my food was obviously a brown, 2.5-3 inch long hair. I will give you guys the benefit of the doubt and continue to come but I really recommend that your cooks wear hairnets. I noticed your cooks wearing hats that they would take off periodically and wipe away their sweat, which is kinda gross. Please review what I have written and try to amend it. I am not looking for you guys to give me free food or a discount, I just wanted to give you guys a heads up."}
{"text":"Came in late night for a late night dinner. The chicken quesadilla was amazing!!! Also grabbed a mango margarita and I was not disappointed! Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"Great tacos for only $2 each. Go with the pulled pork. The habanero sauce on the side adds great flavor if you can take the heat. Would have been 5 stars but the quesadillas are just average. Stick with the tacos and you will be happy."}
{"text":"We kindly were asked to come back and give Fuzzy's another try. I had the vegetarian soup with a nice size amount of cold sour cream and green herbs! Yum! My boyfriend got two soft tacos with ground beef and fajita style steak. I would love to see some options on wine that are more set at a house price. The atmosphere is big and open, so perfect for groups in large parties and meet ups. Every one orders at the front and they bring it to your table. Super easy for those who are visiting family and friends in the area for a relaxed basic taco experience."}
{"text":"Best chicken nachos ever!!!  Great place for beer and football!!!  My kids and hubby love it!!!  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent it's was early and dead ., but the service was quick and fast ., don't know why it was a Sunday and it looked like a sports bar type of place but I guess it more of a college feel, being that your next to ASU"}
{"text":"All time favorite is Eldorado Cantina. Nothing close to that place. First time in today. However this place has an awesome fresh \"Fujita chicken burrito\".  Add Pico, guacamole, cheese, in the neighborhood. Clean place,  friendly staff, fresh ingredients. Good beer selection too."}
{"text":"Food is always great, so is the service! They always forget one of my tacos, but are always quick to fix the mistake. I'm here for my lunch break at least once a week."}
{"text":"Chilaquiles were bomb!! It's a nice cool spot w/ a decent bar and drinks w/ good breakfast options!!"}
{"text":"Good refried beans, very interesting and delicious tacos, chips were good.  Unfortunately, the salsa tastes exactly like marinara sauce and the rice is a little flavorless.  Otherwise pretty good!"}
{"text":"The nachos has fake squirted on cheese! So gross. I only ate because I was hungover and dying. The burrito was ok........ but the pork in it was stinky/dry."}
{"text":"9/13/15: After hearing about this place for months, I decided to give it a go. Just after 2 times, I can say that this spot will become a regular for me. Quality and anything that wont break your wallet is what I like to eat! The quesodillas are a little better than the burritos. They are flawless! And the margaritas are good as well! Decent beer options as well! Will be back numerous times!  7/31/17: Literally come here once a week and nothing has changed. I'm in love and wish I could actually put a ring on this place. One thing that is new (to my knowledge) is the app. If you come here often, you'll etc free food after spending X amount of money. That's no problem for me because I'm in this for life"}
{"text":"First time visit, and I'll start off by saying that I fully enjoyed my meal and I'll definitely come back. I ordered the fajita plate for $10.99 which I had to choose two sides. I chose boracha beans (pinto beans cooked in beer, miller lite to be exact) these were the best beans I've had at a restaurant in quite sometime. Not only did the beer add a unique flavor but bacon was also simmered along with the beans. I'll admit the fat content may be higher do to the bacon, but damn it...ITS BACON . Highly recommended when you visit. The next item was Mix-Mex rice. Their version of fried rice...Not a fan. I'll explain why, first omit the peas and carrots (blah) needs some peppers, onions or something other then peas and carrots. The rice seem crunchy as in not fully cooked. Overall flavor was bland, especially after tasting the beans. Now the main course, the fajitas. Very good in fact everything you'd come to expect from a fajita. Now the only downside was there simply was not enough veggies. I had three bell pepper strips. C'mon that's teasing me! Plenty of meat however. Very   If you get a chance, go by and draw your own conclusions. I enjoyed my visit and I especially loved those beans..."}
{"text":"Third time back here. The tacos are great, and they have a very nice selection. 5$ margaritas are well worth it. Tried the fajita chicken nachos this time, so good, delicious. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"So the food is TexMex that's why it's a little different but even for TexMex food it's sub par there is nothing here that says I have to come back it's just homemade Taco Bell food. I was really disappointed but I will say that's the staff was nice at least."}
{"text":"The one and only downside of Fuzzy's, to me, is that the price is a TEENY bit high. But I say that as a college student with very little disposable income who wouldn't mind if everything in life were one or two dollars cheaper. So.  Besides that, I immediately fell in love with Fuzzy's the first time I went. I got one soft crawfish taco and one crispy ground beef (love that you can order tacos a la carte), and both were delicious. I wasn't expecting the feta to be good, but that + garlic sauce = amazing. My date and I also ordered the chips & guacamole, which were great. Chips were well-seasoned, not just plain old Tostitos, and the guac looked and tasted homemade.  The atmosphere is fun (paper towel holders on each table!), the food is tasty and fresh...love it."}
{"text":"Service was great! Kind, attentive and professional. We rolled the dice on prices because the website and exterior menu board has none. For casual Mex with things on the side it's pricey, It's also Mill, so... We ate and left, but I would bet this place has it's moments. Tacos are tasty and salsa is ok but at lunch with 1 beer each it was $50 bucks I would be more likely to just stroll by next time."}
{"text":"queso was pretty much watered can cheese ... tacos were cold ...good thing it was $1 taco day... spicy pork was not great at all couldn't finish one bite"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's Taco Shop is one of my favorite casual restaurants on Mill Ave. Conveniently located and in walking distance to my work, I have to resist being there every week for Taco Tuesday.  Needless to say, this place does get really crowded during lunch hours, especially on Tuesdays. So if you want to avoid the lunch crowd, avoid going there between 12 and 1 pm.  But not only is Fuzzy's one of my to go places for lunch, it is also one of my favorites after a night out on Mill Ave. Those juicy tacos really hit the spot and absorb anything in your system before heading back home. They have two registers to take the orders and the kitchen staff is pretty fast and efficient. With that crowed the occasional mix up is unavoidable, but all the great flavors you get to enjoy, really make up for it."}
{"text":"Inexpensive taco place. You order the food at the counter and they bring the food to you. Service is quick and very friendly staff. The place is huge and even has a bar. We ordered the taco plate which included two tacos and two sides. I also ordered a bean and cheese nachos and it was huge."}
{"text":"This was a great experience with great service. I like places were they make you feel like you are friends. Good lunch break margaritas, don't judge me."}
{"text":"Mmmm.... Pork tacos and chips n queso!!!"}
{"text":"Im a fan.  My friend and I met for lunch here last week. The service was great and our food came out relatively quickly.  I had a chicken and a steak fajita taco. Delicious. I loved the use of feta (which Im not a fan of on its own) instead of shredded cheddar. It was much more melty. I wasnt so much a fan of their salsa, but then again I like Pace (gimme a break, Im not from here! ;) ).  An all around good experience. Ill definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wooooow. The yelp reviews weren't kidding. We went here during IMAZ, since we didn't want to stray too far from the finish. I understand being busy, but they had run out of both refried AND black beans, and seemed to be running out of lettuce, too. Our food took a long time to come out, and when it did, it was strewn on the plate, my friend's tortillas were literally refrigerated (just throw then on the grill, dudes!) and my other friend's taco had cheese on it, even though she asked for it without.   The saving grace of the place were the drink specials... there's absolutely nothing wrong with $2 draft beers, especially when you have a good selection. And the mangorita was delicious. So, in conclusion, you can come here to drink, but my god, that food was not good. As my friend says, \"this is what happens to taco joints when you run all your mexicans out of town.\""}
{"text":"Great food, nice place, and the staff is very helpful. The chips are friekin incredible and super tasty!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably tasty. This will be my new \"go-to\" place for Mexican fare. Trendy style dine-in or take-out. More options for the type of rice and beans than high end restaurants, which is great if your tired of the standard Mexican style rice and refried beans.   You must try Fuzzy's!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to fuzzys 2-3 times a week until I worked nights and couldn't go anymore. My orders when I went were sometimes messed up or not made correctly. I have never complained. I have been craving it for months now and I just ordered fuzzys tonight (12-1-17 ) over the phone. The workers messed up the order, needless to say, 1 out of every 3 times, they always miss something or something isn't made right.. i got to the restaurant and I had to wait for 20 min for them to remake the food. I got home and was missing another order. I went back to your restaurant and the meal I was missing , the workers forgot to put it in the bag so now I have to wait another 10 min ! Very annoying!!  Idk why you have people working there that can't make something correct the first time. It's not rocket science ! It's a fast food joint... sorry for the bad review but maybe this will make you guys change your ways and get the proper training you all need."}
{"text":"In a word - Meh. Eating dinner rather late around 9 pm last Friday night we stumbled upon Fuzzy's Taco Shop. It's a big place with a big menu and a lot of seating that closes at 11 pm. Other than us, there was only one other family dining in. We couldn't help but notice how dead it was for a Friday night.  We ordered a few things - Chips & Salsa, 2 crunchy\"Special\" ground beef tacos, 2 crunchy \"California Heat\" Shrimp Tacos, 1 soft Chicken Fajita Taco and 2 orders of Latin Fried Potatoes. Everything was just ok, nothing was bursting with flavor. There was nothing special about the ground beef and no heat was felt while eating the California Heat tacos. I wouldn't crave or rave about anything that we ate. All our food was totally Taco Bell quality, not what we expected at all. Although one could say that I should be willing to go back and try other items on Fuzzy's big menu before canceling this place out, we were so turned off by the dullness of the food we actually ate that we'll have to pass."}
{"text":"Best (brisket) burrito on the SW side of #effingVegas hands down - tho a bit pricey.   The side of BORRACHO BEANS alone are worth the trip.    Get an extra order!!   =]"}
{"text":"Breakfast tacos are amazing!!! Great guacamole and good priced beers on tap.... brand new still working on the flow but overall great !!"}
{"text":"We went there for Father's Day and it wasn't busy! Ordering was super easy and they have a great selection of menu items! All of our food was amazing and it was very clean! The lady at the counter was also really helpful when we were checking how many chicken strips came in the kids meal! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I love it! The food is fantastic and so are the margaritas!! Bathroom not very clean but that's about it."}
{"text":"Food was fast, staff was friendly, variety was decent. My only complaint would be price, as it is a little expensive, but for the quality, it's worth a trip every once in a while."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Del taco and Taco Bell are about on par.   Well, this place isn't horrible, but it is very middle of the road mediocre. I tried the nachos with shredded chicken, and a brisket taco.  First off with the taco. I chose a soft corn tortilla with shredded brisket. The tortilla comes out cold with cold lettuce and cold tomatoes and cold cotija cheese, but the meat is hot. The meat itself is actually kind of good. I wish it was a bit more juicy though. I like when juices are running out the back of the taco while trying to eat it. The issue with everything being cold when the meat is hot is that if you let your taco sit for 2 minutes, the meat gets cold.  Ok, for the nachos I did the shredded chicken with sour cream. I guess sour cream doesn't come standard on it? They use a liquid cheese and what tastes like a white corn tortilla chip. They put tomato and onion on top with the chicken and a dollop of sour cream on the side of the plate.   The chips taste like store bought chips sitting under a heat lamp. The chicken was ok (again, not super juicy). Where's the guacamole? Where's the beans? Where's the crunchy chips?   They had \"butt burning\" hot sauce on the table. I LOVE hot sauce and spicy foods. I drenched my nachos in the habenero sauce and never broke a sweat. It was about on level with Taco Bell mild sauce.  Positives? The staff is super friendly, the restaurant is really clean, and they give you a reusable cup for soda! Free refills for returning guests? No idea, but that might be cool."}
{"text":"The key word for Fuzzy's is bland. This is some of the most taste-free food I've ever had. Earlier this year I purchased a Groupon worth $10, and on my way home from Art Fair on the Square I decided to stop in.   Fuzzy's is inexpensive, so I ordered the taco plate (2 soft shell - chicken and shredded beef, with Mexican rice and fried potatoes for the sides), chips & queso, and a soda to bump me up past the $10 mark.   The signature of Fuzzy's is their unorthodox toppings - in addition to your standard lettuce/tomato/guac/etc, they include feta cheese and garlic sauce. At least they claim to, anyway. On my tacos there was maybe three little crumbles of feta (which in combination with the other cheese is enough, but not really enough to add any flavor), and I didn't taste any garlic at all.   The tacos are heaping and meat-heavy, but again - little flavor. I probably could have closed my eyes and not been sure which taco had chicken and which had beef. The rice was okay, and probably the most flavorful thing overall. The fried potatoes had a slightly undercooked generic potato flavor. The chips and queso is ridiculously large - for $3 you get five or six servings of chips and somewhere around 1-1.5 cups of melted cheese. This would be an awesome deal if the queso wasn't so blah.   Fuzzy's seems to be going for some sort of Tex-Mex/Mexicali hybrid, and for me it just doesn't work. What little flavor the dishes did have was not a flavor profile I enjoyed. I had hope for Fuzzy's being that it was a Texas chain -  while living in Texas I had plenty of cheap, chain Mexican food that wasn't great but was miles above Taco Bell. I was hoping Fuzzy's would be in the same category, but the only part that reminds me of the food I enjoyed down south was the fact they had Dr. Pepper and Fanta on tap."}
{"text":"Came on taco Tuesday, where most tacos are $1.70. Except for the shrimp tacos. I got chicken, pork, and grilled fish tacos. They all were tasty and a decent size.   Their hot sauce definitely made them much better to me, a nice flavor and kick added.   Got a half pina colada half strawberry margarita and was very disappointed. It tasted like juice and had no buzz to it. It comes in a large glass too. You'd expect to get a bang for your buck and think you're getting a strong or somewhat strong drink but literally was like drinking a virgin strawberry pina colada and I have a fairly low tolerance so I thought about sharing it with someone to be safe but what a waste.   Not sure if I would be back. If I did come it would only be for taco Tuesday and definitely would not get a drink. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Good college taco shop- good tacos and outside patio - gets a bit noisy and crazy when the kids are around. But good place when summer break and spring break is around"}
{"text":"So after a second visit, I'm going to have to update my review and bring it down a star.  My first visit was really pretty good...so good that I decided to order the same meal, the pork torta.  Unfortunately, it wasn't the same meal.  This time, there was hardly any meat and it was seriously lacking flavor.  The potatoes were also served cold.  This visit was definitely disappointing compared to the first.  If you decide to give it a try, I hope you get the right cook!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for tacos. Inexpensive, yet the quality is great. Personally, I think the shredded chicken nachos are the best thing on the menu, but you can't go wrong with any of the choices."}
{"text":"Eh. Tacos were aiite. The shrimp one was better than the chicken. I would never plan to come back here. There are so many better taco places. It wasn't the worse but I don't really recommend it at all. The have two hot sauces which were good. Price is typical."}
{"text":"Great tacos and excellent beeritas!!! Viva El Mexico!!!! The service was amazing and hey have a wonderful patio. Welcome to the hood Fuzzy's."}
{"text":"I odered the 2 taco plate w/ a soft corn tortilla grilled fish taco and a soft corn tortilla grilled shrimp taco. Both tacos were good, but the shrimp was my favorite. My plate also came with 2 sides, borracho beans (pinto beans cooked in beer w/ bacon) and cilantro-lime rice. The beans were pretty good, but I did add salt and hot sauce. The rice, however, tasted like it was straight from a box or a frozen dinner...it had a plastic taste and was just gross. I also had the chips and queso and those were the bomb diggity. They don't have a salsa bar, but their bottled hot sauce isn't bad. The parking lot was really full, but they were pretty empty. The food came out quick and everyone was nice. The dinning room was pretty clean, but it was uncomfortably warm.  They have a large selection of beer on tap, and some margaritas that I'll have to try on another occasion because I was on my lunch break."}
{"text":"I stopped in here yesterday for lunch. It was my first time so I asked the employee who was taking my order a few questions about their food and what would be good to order. I ended up getting the brisket nachos and two tacos, one soft and one hard with their seasoned ground beef. The sauce on the nachos was weird and not authentic mexican as it was some kind of garlic sauce. The queso tasted like kraft macaroni and cheese with out the noodles. Guacamole was bland. Tacos were just fine. Their tortilla chips were dusted with their own special seasoning which included paprika. I just felt like they were trying too hard and the recipes were unique and under developed, I thought it was going to be authentic mexican and it turned out to be like mexican food out of a white persons kitchen. The food is so confusing and shouldn't be called mexican but maybe the first clue was in the name \"Fuzzy's\""}
{"text":"The kid loved the place.   Grilled fish soft taco's is what was had.  The kid wanted more so this place was inadvertenly served as Dinner.   I thought I wrote an earlier review and was coming to just do an update but no review. Shocking, as I went a while back (maybe a year) and I liked their tempura shrimp taco (frozen fried shrimp) soft and had it again.   When I ordered a 2 taco plate with rice and potatoes - kid approved of it all.  I take into consideration they had games for kids abound so I know that didn't influence the decision to like the tacos yet it had an impact on liking the place - overall. Kids are critical.   Anywhoo, the word I got: GRILLED FISH SOFT TACO'S ARE GREAT. A total of 3 were had. I had to cut the kid off like a bar back telling a drunkard - ergh NO MORE.   I had the tempura shrimp soft taco & shrimp enchilada w/ rice and beans. ASked for more garlic sauce on the side. I'm a fan of it.   THIS IS TEX-MEX. AND THE PATIO WAS A HIT LAST NIGHT. Wi-fi via Starbucks, next door is kind of unrealiable and it's right next door.   But guess what.....? They have chilaquiles on the breakfast menu. Didn't realize they opened for breakfast so now we have a compromising spot. I hate breakfast and the rest of the family loves it. So, I can go out w/ them and have non-breakfast food.   $1 Margarita Wednesdays Taco Tuesdays like a good tex-mex place should have.  Coupons are always circulatin."}
{"text":"I feel I tried enough menu items to not visit this place again.  The chicken has almost no flavor and is covered with cold cheese & lettuce. The pork was a little bit better, but you're better off going for their breakfast menu.  The people that work there are nice, the ambiance is great, but when it comes down to it, I don't think the food is worth skipping other restaurants for."}
{"text":"Tasty and inexpensive and quick service! Knocked off one star because the restaurant isn't incredibly clean."}
{"text":"Decent fast-casual Mexican food, although the \"fast\" part is up for debate. I like the breakfast tacos better than the lunch/dinner items. I waited too long for my chorizo/potato/cheese/egg tacos, but they were hot when they came out and the fillings were plentiful. The salsa is somewhat unique -- not chunky at all but tangy with good flavor. Almost a vinegary hint, maybe? The ingredients seem fresh and the food is presented well. I'm not a fan of feta cheese on Mexican food (or any food, really) so I skip the cheese on my tacos. I like the chicken better than the beef. Overall, a good place for a cold beer and a cheap lunch or dinner. I'd go here over Laredo's, which is (was?) just down University Avenue to the west."}
{"text":"Yum! Came here on Tuesday by accident. Delish! The briscuit taco was my fav'! Love the combination of the garlic sauce & feta cheese. Unique. Yummy. Will come again.   Hate the crap bumper stickers above the kitchen. Come on ~ hate that junk! Made me uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Went last night. Some of the best queso I've ever had. If only I could order a jacuzzi portion and bathe in it.  Brisket was on-point. You can tell these guys are originally from Texas. Management and employees were friendly and helped recommend what to get.   The margaritas...delicious. Not too sweet, good amount of tequila, and ice cold. They've got TVs as well so you can watch football. The place is clean and well-kept. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by today. The food was good, service was nice, and atmosphere is inviting. I like their concept, you order at the counter, but they have a bar as well where you can enjoy nice choice of beers and speciality drinks. My and my wife had shredded chicken salads with avocado ranch dressing. It was surprisingly good. Keep it up guys, thank you!"}
{"text":"Margaritas with a beer $8.50!  I got the Red,White and Blue Margarita and it comes with my favorite blueberry beer which happens to be a 8% alcohol content. Beer on draft of Monday's is only $3! You can't beat that!   Tacos are delicious! Their combo meal of two tacos with 2 sides is a sweet deal!   Their brisket burrito is bomb! They are not stingy with their   Their shredded chicken salad with their house vinaigrette is good too!  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Nice employes fast and awesome. I go here and hang out at the bar talk with other customers and the workers here are super nice. I love going here."}
{"text":"I read recently that Fuzzy's is moving out and Curry in a Box is moving in soon. Perhaps that is why they were out of half their side dishes and the customer service was utterly horrible. It's too bad because with the right management/ownership & employees Fuzzy's would thrive because they do have good food when they're on."}
{"text":"Tried most of the tacos.. food is good.. but no salsa bar? The sauce in packets is more for fried chicken than anything else.. ordered $28 worth of food and didn't want to give me a small handful of salsa packets.."}
{"text":"Some of these reviews just crack me up. Here's the 411 on Fuzzy's. This is a cheap little taco joint on the ASU campus. The taco and tamales are great, the beer is cold and there's plenty of hot sauce to go around. If you're looking for an upscale, clean and trendy taco place MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T GO TO A PLACE THAT SERVES DOLLAR TACOS IN A PLASTIC BASKET! Rock on Fuzzy's!"}
{"text":"We love the little strip mall this place is in. We are frequent customers to the rest of the business in it, so we thought we would give Fuzzy's a try!  My husband got the breakfast burrito, and I got my usual staple, a salad with grilled shrimp. As far as the atmosphere goes, this place is pretty cool. They were playing great music, and I could totally dig it inside for a late night hangout or a weekend spot. We saw one other couple with GIANT fishbowl margaritas. Other than that, for a Monday night around 6 pm, the place was pretty dead. Cashier was SUPER friendly and awesome.  We got the food to go so we could silently judge it at home. It was bland and low quality. My $8 shrimp salad was iceberg lettuce, sad fridge-burned veggies, a few overly salty tortilla strips, and a few shrimp. I had ordered the avocado ranch dressing, but it was just ranch...no hint of avocado. My husbands burrito sadly sung the same story.   I might come back to try something different, but overall was not impressed with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the service is great, and taco Tuesdays are a big hit. What more do you want from a Mexican food joint?"}
{"text":"Pretty good fish tacos. I get the grilled fish tacos on a tortilla. They come with fish, lettuce, cilantro and feta cheese. Would recommend going on tuesday when they are only $1.50 each! Three of them will most likely fill you up for only $4.50."}
{"text":"I first tried Fuzzys in Austin, Texas and believed it was a local resturant to that area. I loved their food and was stoked to learn that it was a chain that had a location in Madison (lived in Texas last summer, moved to Madison I'm the fall).  The tacos are small which allows you to mix it up and try a could of flavors. Very good margaritas and queso."}
{"text":"I love this place! It reminds me of Texas. Their tacos are always yummy and so are their margaritas! I just wish they salsa wasn't as chunky and they gave you more queso than a tiny little bowl when you order it. My boyfriend does the iPhone rewards program and both of us have gotten free t-shirts out of it so that's cool (and shows you how much we go...)!"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and always had a great experience until tonight. Husband and I both order the cilantro rice for our sides yet mine looks completely different than his and much different than it ever has. Was essentially mushy and gross. Quality and consistently control. Asked about the difference and was told \"oh yours must have been sitting there and not stirred up\".... seriously? Pathetic. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Probably my top favorite taco shop on the southwest side of town. All you see on this side is Roberto's and Don Tor Taco. Definitely something different and unique, makes it stand out from the rest. Sports bar kind of feel. Dining in it was real clean, spacious. Larger than I expected. Had some out side seating as well. Service was also great. Must try if you haven't already"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Tempe, I always try to make an excuse to go to Fuzzy's! I love their chips and queso paired with a margarita!"}
{"text":"If I could have gave Fuzzy's a 0 star I still would give it a 1. The absolute only thing that was awesome was their mango margarita. All of our food order was completely wrong. Customer service was awful. Our messed up order tasted awful. My daughter that suggested Fuzzy's later told me this place is horrible, I thought you knew..... So for future Fuzzy goers, drink the margaritas don't eat food."}
{"text":"Hands down the nastiest and most disappointing mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at. The burritos are stuffed with cheese to compensate for the lack of meat they put in the burrito. Like I was eating a cheeze it burrito.  The menus reads the burritos is stuffed with gauc, by stuffed they mean a small scoop that isn't noticeable and the gauc has no flavor. The food was very bland, the beer was the best part of the meal. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. This place probably gets business from the drunks students who's taste buds are layered with alcohol so they can't taste the lack of flavor."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Fuzzy's for lunch. The shredded pork tacos are delicious. I far prefer this place over Qdoba or Chipotle. The dining experience is far better. They have tons of TV's to watch all the sports your heart desires! They also Serve Mexican Coke which is awesome because they use real sugar. If you feel the need to indulge in an Alcoholic beverage they have those too!  They offer a lot more variety than the typical chain. So give it a try."}
{"text":"The red head who works as the cashier needs to get fired. She is rude and doesn't know how to do her job. The customer service was poor.. The tacos were ok though. Will probably be back next Tuesday."}
{"text":"Their food is inconsistent and their sweet tea is gross. Their staff is very friendly and helpful and they will bend over backward to fix any issues. I really enjoy the spicy pork with the garlic sauce, the potatos were pretty good too, can't get enough of the queso. The churros were bland and their beans pretty gross.  The overall restaurant was very clean and shiny and new, but the floor in the dining area was slick like an ice skating rink , be careful. Also I have ordered the same exact thing 3 different times and it was significantly different each time. Also my husbands tacos were not what he ordered either. It's like a really fun game of taco roulette, you order at the counter , but you never know what may end up at your table."}
{"text":"Great deals on taco Tuesday. Tacos were tasty.   But all you really need to know is this: They mix lettuce into their guac to make it fill up the cup it's served in.   I was appalled."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. to nice staff, friendly.  Damn good burritos. I glad they turned the stereo down when we where here it was ridiculous when we walked in.  But happy with the meal over all.  Beer is crazy priced tho! Way expensive for a dive of a bar. Oh well."}
{"text":"I loved this place but it has been less than average lately.  I go here strictly for Taco Tuesday's.  $1.50 tacos.  First time I went here, I was amazed at how tasty the Tempura Fish Taco was.  I like how it is topped with feta cheese.  I smother my tacos with their butt burning hot sauce.  I dare try not to test the habanero sauce.  The issue is not the food.  Service, presentation, and time to get my food is what makes this 3 stars.  Their cashiers are always slow.  And the time it takes to make 2 tacos seems like eternity.  To top it off, the portions of meat in the tacos have shrank and it seems they just through everything all over the place.  I don't know what happened but this place is going down.  Hopefully it gets better soon."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm Shrimp tacos! I don't know what the other reviews were about, but I this place is one of my favs on Mill.  When you walk in, it's like a surf shop vibe. The food is good and cheap, what else can a broke college student ask for?!  The hot sauce is the perfect amount of flavor and zing and the servers are always friendly.    And the cups are like souvenier cups.  It's like a goodie bag after going to a birthday party"}
{"text":"I went here this past weekend and used a Groupon.  My bill was under $2.00 so I can't complain about the price I paid this time.  I liked the atmosphere, and the food was ready quickly.  The place was clean and  employees were friendly. I had the grilled shrimp quesadilla, a chicken fajita salad, and a chicken fajita plate.  All were pretty tasty.  I would have liked to have seen more meat in the dishes, as the portions were a good size.  That would be my only complaint.  I will definitely give it a try again."}
{"text":"I live near downtown Tempe and eat here at least once a week. I always get the chicken quesadilla with a side order of chips and queso and have yet to be disappointed. The staff is always really cool and polite. Overall I recommend this place if you love quesadillas and queso!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. We love tacos and anything related. This place has a lot of work to do. We ordered the jalapeño bottle caps and chicken bowls. Jalapeño bottle caps were ok, it's just breaded jalapeños. The chicken bowls were such a waste of money. My cilantro was black in spots, the chicken was old and dry and the potatoes (I added to sub rice and beans) were cold. Total waste of money and would never recommend."}
{"text":"Being a Mexican I had my doubts of the quality and authenticity of their menu but my boyfriend convinced my to try it so I did. I had the brisket soft taco, spicy pork taco and the shredded chicken nachos and they were to my surprise very very good. I would strongly recommend trying their menu. The atmosphere was quaint and appealing. I will come back on my next trip to Tempe."}
{"text":"This place needs a serious upgrade. Dirty and run down.   Was down town and just looking for a quick bite. Food was okay and they do serve drinks but had a hard time getting pass how dirty the place was.  Used the washroom and thought I was going to get a disease. Disgusting and filthy don't know how it passes a city sanitation inspection."}
{"text":"Ok just so everyone knows this is more gringo mexican. With that being said is still really good. The prices are really low for the amount you get. The drinks are pretty awesome and big and cheap. I go there like once a week"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it!  wasn't too sure based on the appearance of the inside of the restaurant. Food was delicious.  Two fajita bowls and two quesadillas ordered.  Chips & guac.  We enjoyed every bite!  Would come back often if I was local."}
{"text":"Decent taco for good prices. I didn't even know this place was a chain. They have some pretty hot sauces too."}
{"text":"You would think that with a line out the door that the food would suffer, but nope! The tacos were stuffed and were as good as ever. Only a few things to mention, the side of the kitchen seemed a little dirty and the margaritas aren't frozen enough. They're always so tasty but the past few times I have gone they have been very watery."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Terrible food.  Food was old probably prepared days before, the rice and tortillas were hard ."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's has replaced Amor de Brazil in Syacmore Commons, which means that they have a rather large space to fill - and that by many definitions they are perhaps not a \"shop\", but rather a full-blown \"restaurant'. This is perhaps being a bit particular, but as they just opened, it becomes important.   At least on their first night of business, they were seeing a brisk crowd - in fact, for most of the places in this strip, it would be a ton of business - but because of the sheer size of the location, it really wasn't full. Unfortunately, due to a lack of training, unclear registers or some other reason, just having a line two people long to order tacos took way longer than it should have.  The good news is that once you get through the ordering process itself, there were plenty of seats available, the rest of the staff was ready and waiting to help - lots of them wandering around and clearing off unused items and making sure that the visit was good, and once the food came up it didn't take long to deliver to the table (you are given one of those numbers that you stick on your table so they know where to send it once it is ready).  As to the food? It's reasonable enough, and you can come out full for a few dollars, probably less than you will spend at most Mexican restaurants, but there are other, more authentic places around if you look closely enough. Many of the tacos we tried - and we tried several of them - didn't have much flavor, and even add the \"Butt Burnin\" sauce didn't help a whole lot (and my butt wasn't burnin', either - so the advertising wasn't really telling the truth, either!).  Regardless, it was their first night, so here is to hoping that things improve."}
{"text":"Ordered thru UberEats today so can't comment on dining in but I was AMAZED by the chips, beans, cilantro/lime rice, & veggie soup. Everything was so delicious & it was SO much food- I will make 2-3 meals out one meal + the soup.   The prices are great too! I really cannot wait to dine in next time!"}
{"text":"So this is my second time here with my wife. The first time here was pretty good, we shared chicken nachos which we enjoyed.  This time we decided to be a little more adventurous, and by adventurous I mean I ordered a chicken burrito and she a chicken taco and an enchilada with a side of chips with queso.  Firstly, everything came out cold. My burrito was like a chicken wrap. Had no Mexican flair and far under seasoned if no seasoning can be called under.   Her food came out cold too. We sent back the enchilada and the queso because who likes cold food? When it came back it was beyond clear that it had been microwaved- cheese with that film on top that we all know too well, with the plate, bowl, rice and potatoes all equally nuked- hot and fresh from the \"kitchen aid.\"  The service- everyone is friendly but I really don't need to be told after the microwaved queso has come back out and I've eaten some that \"the queso is really good,\"by the service staff. I've already tasted it and have already drawn my own conclusion. Thanks."}
{"text":"I kept hearing this place was opening I was very excited to try it with my friends. It did not disappoint great food, great service.  The menu has something for everyone kids an all. I ordered the grilled shrimp quesadilla an queso  dip with ground beef.  That was the best shrimp cooked perfectly not over done an the dip an chips couldn't get enough:) my friend ordered the burrito an guacamole she said both were great. They also have frozen drinks alcoholic an Non.  I will be back if your craving mexican an your in matthews make sure you stop :)"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's Taco! Really? And I thought Pink Tacos was provocative! Hahaha ... I guess NOT! Well, I was very pleasantly surprised about Fuzzy's Taco. Prices are very affordable! They play rock and roll! And they serve alcohol!  I personally don't eat spicy food, so I asked the cashier before ordering what items would be recommended.  I like chicken, so I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas (fajita chicken) with double orders of cilantro rice. Chicken was still spicy for me, and the cilantro rice was little bit undercooked or dry. Otherwise the meal was tasty. Also ordered the Grilled Shrimp taco ($2.49), soft flour taco. I really liked this taco! I think this was the best grilled shrimp taco I ever had!  BF ordered the 3 Tacos platter, and he was very pleased with it, too.  Fuzzy's Taco Shop is going to be my favorite Grilled Shrimp Taco place to be from now on!"}
{"text":"Great good, good prices!  Very nice employees.  The outdoor seating is a plus and is very clean.  1$ Taco Tuesday night is awesome!"}
{"text":"We ordered burrito bowls and we're surprised at the lack of food in the bowl. It looked like they were both half eaten, very small portions for the price. Nice people, but where was the food?"}
{"text":"It's cheap, the margaritas are huge, they serve breakfast tacos all day (proper breakfast tacos, not Taco Bell's waffle nonsense), and you can sit on the patio with a giant drink and a plate of breakfast tacos, feeling vaguely like an expatriate who ought to be listening to Mexican radio. It's the next best thing to being in Tijuana eating barbecued iguana. (I can't swear there isn't an iguana taco -- have another 'rita and go take a look, 'kay?)  It's a \"scene\" restaurant, as most things on Mill Avenue are, so not the thing if you're feeling incapable of coping with sudden, loud noises, many of them made by inebriated undergraduates. If you go at a dead-ish time of day, it's not in-your-face loud. The staff are perky and patient while you figure out the menu for the first time, and they don't go nuts over trying to turn tables if there isn't a crowd. This is counter service -- order up front, pick up the food in the back when called -- so it's pretty low key.  The breakfast tacos are pleasant, more than life-changing. If you have a serious problem with fairly well-done scrambled eggs, ask up front to have them runnier or order something else, as these are quite well-done eggs. In the future, I would stick to variations where there's something greasy like chorizo to counter the stiffness of the eggs. These tacos are very generous -- I thought I was starving and couldn't finish a plate of two with the accompanying Latin potatoes (which are very nice) and refried beans (which are generic).  As far as Mexican restaurants of this sort -- silly name, self-conciously funky decor, waitresses in tight shirts, very large drinks, loud music, okay food -- go, this is a bargain with a nice view of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Usually order to go.  They're open early and serve breakfast all day.  The service is slow but the potato, egg and cheese burrito is pretty good.    They do great specials for taco Tuesday, but beware because the place is packed from 11 to 1.   They have a full bar and some crazy drinks for the college kids. Pain killers!"}
{"text":"My friends really talked this place up, but overall I left disappointed. Its saving grace is its extremely reasonable prices ($2/taco.) But overall, I wasn't that impressed. I had a fish taco, shrimp taco and pork taco. Of these, the pork was the best, but some of the pork in the middle was a bit under. Both the fish and shrimp tacos had little flavor to speak of, and the ratio of toppings (lettuce/cheese etc.) to protein was off. Tortillas were nothing to write home about either.  The food took too long given the atmosphere/style of the food. The interior was kind of schizophrenic, an incongruous mix of sports stuff and traditional Mexican restaurant decor.  But all this being said, the tacos are worth $2, and though I went on a Saturday, there are pretty good specials the rest of the week."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we used to go to a Fuzzy's location in Texas frequently, so when we heard of a location opening here in town we were excited to say the least. The food was just alright and wasn't nearly as well prepared as to what we were use to with this company. The fish taco was a major let down. The picture can show just how much fish I received on that order. The girl at the counter was helpful and nice and we appreciated her suggestions but it still wasn't enough to make up for the quality of food we paid for. Not sure if we will be returning."}
{"text":"At the end of a night on Mill when most of my friends go to Silvermine, I make a beeline to Fuzzy's. I feel like so many restaurants have crashed and burned at this location but Fuzzy's certainly deserves to stay. I almost always get the shredded carnitas burrito, but the shredded beef and chicken are great options, too. On St. Patty's Day, even when Rula Bula Pub was literally across the street, this place was packed and bumpin', serving tacos and burritos within minutes of ordering. I highly recommend this place if you like Chronic Tacos or Filiberto's."}
{"text":"It's just okay.  Dont understand all the hype.  It's better than taco bell cause they serve liquor.   That's about it."}
{"text":"This place is great. Super casual. Even if there is a line it moves super fast.  Always friendly.  Get the Chorizo Queso."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch time snack of guacamole and chips today. The first bit of bad news is their driveway; huge pot holes right where the entrance meets the sidewalk at University Avenue. I mean, break an axle huge.  The restaurant interior is oddly laid out, with huge communal tables and very few places for individuals or smaller parties to sit. The music is loud, and everything has that vaguely sticky patina of a beachside popsicle stand, including the riotous color scheme.  They did prepare my order quickly, and the service was friendly. Too bad the food was utterly disappointing. The tortilla chips had the distinctly off flavor of rancid cooking oil, and the guacamole was thick and gluey in texture and unremarkable in flavor. I got up and left after a few bites."}
{"text":"This place has a laid back college vibe which might appeal to some. I ordered the chicken taco plate with black beans and the fried rice. Unfortunately I did not care much for the meal. The black beans were alright, the rice a little less than that, and the chicken tacos were super dry. The hot sauce was too heavy on the vinegar to lessen the dryness without offense either.   If you're into cheap college food with space to sit around, then you may dig this place, but I thought it was pretty bad. I did give it a chance though, despite the bad reviews."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is such a fun place with yummy food. I had always just come here to drink since they have huge beeritas/beergaritas but one day I decided to try their food and it is actually really scrumptious. The workers are always so pleasant and funny, I feel like such a regular now. Their tacos, enchiladas, and tamales are great! Also their mex-mex rice and beans are delicious. It is a great location on Mill and when you're done eating you can walk upstairs to Vintage or across the street to the Vine, Rula Bula, or Moonshine. Parking is usually pretty easy to fine on the meters between Fuzzy's and Caffe Boa.  Also they have a reward system that gives you points every time you visit, it's the Fuzzy's app, check it out"}
{"text":"I just ordered through them through grubhub I ordered A Crispy shredded beef taco, Shredded Pork and beans and a breakfast burrito, Of the three the only thing that wasnt oh my god cheap ingredients was the breakfast burrito but how can you mess up bacon egg and cheese? The shredded pork and beans were pinto beans with some chopped bacon put in which I guess is pork but definitely not as advertised, The Taco came in a shell that was the same thing I can get from Taco bell I expected at least a fried corn tortilla not a hard taco shell from the grocery store.  Stay away if you want anything actually good"}
{"text":"Mediocre is how I would rate fuzzy's. I've tried the pork taco,  brisket taco,  and chix taco, all salty and the feta cheese thing  is weird. They didn't know ow what Al pastor was.  My kids like it though.  And they have big, cheap beers. I'll go if my kids request,  but it's not something I'll seek out myself."}
{"text":"Great taco spot. It also has a bit of a sports bar feeling if you want a beer with your meal. The staff is really responsive and well put together. They open at 10 so the breakfast burrito was a good choice. If you have kids they have some kids items as well, and the restaurant it's self was very clean     Green Star Cleaning"}
{"text":"I really like the $1 tacos on Tuesday! Their hot sauce is really good too. Great service too. Twice someone came by our table, picked up our trash and asked if we needed anything else. Really wish they had the fried taco shells like Don Tor Taco does but they hard shells are really good. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love Fuzzy's Taco Shop.  It's become my new addiction. The food is always fresh and never greasy. The refried beans and the fried potatoes are yummy. I usually get the cheese enchilada plate and the sauce is a standout.  And I really really really like their chips. They are always fresh and crispy and the portion size is generous. And the sauce that goes with it is outstanding.  I go to Fuzzy's often 3 times a week. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the manager, who is a very nice guy, often walks around checking with customers.  Based on the food and service I give a 5 star rating, hands down. One problem is that the restaurant is a at a very popular newer strip mall that also has a Farmer Boys a Zupa's and a Pizza Rev along with some other busy stores. This strip mall has woefully inadequate parking.  For the volume of customers they would need a lot more spaces. At lunchtime you can drive around the lot for 10 minutes searching for a space. On two occasions I simply could not get parking and was frustrated with competing with other cars for any space that might open up.  So I gave up and left, which is a bummer.   The other day I parked on an adjacent street where other cars were parking.  If you go at less popular times you will be fine. Just avoid the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Fun place to end the night after Mill! Also have some great beergaritas!"}
{"text":"I have been going there for the last two weeks always ordered the brisket shreed salad and it cost $6.99 was very happy with it..big portions enought to feel satisfied. Today i got half of the size and my husband tacos came with alot less shrimp them used to...not happy at all with size of portions of my salad anymore!!!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows I'm not big on chain restaurants.  However when my folks introduced me to Fuzzy's Taco shop on mill I relented only slightly.  The food is delicious,  the atmosphere is nice, clean, has that spark of collage sprit, and lots energy.  Adorned with a chalk drawing of super heroes.  The food keeps me coming back for more when I'm on mill ave.  located close to the light rail Fuzzy's is inexpensive, tasty, and a fun place to visit time and time again."}
{"text":"Great place for taco Tuesday! $1 tacos and they ARENT tiny street tacos! Definitely try this place it."}
{"text":"The food is actually really good here, the only thing is that you need to pick the right from the wrong.  I have gone here 2x now.  The fish taco (tempura covered) was super fishy tasting and almost like it went bad....  the spicy pulled pork tacos are my favorite.  Black beans had great taste, just a little salty.  The chips and salsa was very good!"}
{"text":"Just talking about the lack of good Tex-Mex in Vegas and decided to give this a try. Really, really good food.  Doesn't hurt a bit that it's owned/run by a fellow Frog. Go TCU!  Back to the best Tex-Mex in Vegas."}
{"text":"What confuses me is that this is not a Madison original. If it was, I would say that the lack of quality and bland taste is expected, but if I believe that this originated from Texas then I do not understand. Texas knows Mexican. This is not Mexican. It is not Baja. It is just bland and ordinary. It does an extremely poor job of coming close to being Mexican. I ordered a quesadilla and a grilled vegetable burrito. I actually threw both out. Not even worth eating. The burrito was just filled with lettuce. The cheese in the quesadilla had absolutely no flavor.  I don't know anymore. The restaurants in Madison, Wisconsin are a far cry from restaurants in other areas of the country. I know someone said to me, I haven't reviewed 43 North, Grazie, L'etoile, Lombardino's, etc. I have been to them. I will at some point review them, but they pale in comparison to places like L'espalier in Boston or Alain Ducasse in New York."}
{"text":"What a great find!!  It is different than any of the other Tex-Mex place in town.  First things first though, if you've never been, make sure to look over the menu before you get to the register to order - it makes things better for everyone!  The portion sizes are generous, the prices are bank account-friendly and patio seating is available.  It may be a little awkward for folks who aren't used to their quick-casual style of service - you order at the register, get your drinks, find a table, they call your number, you go get your food.    A pretty decent beer selection too.  I missed out on the Margarita-with-a-Corona-in-it creation but that's something I'll try on my next visit because I will be back."}
{"text":"A Tex-Mex place that combines the lack of authenticity from fast-casual dining like Chipotle with the selection and taste from fast food like Filiberto's.  And adds cheap drafts on game day. No, like REALLY cheap drafts. Could not believe I was paying $2 a pint for a good IPA. The food ain't the most quality stuff, but it tastes nice, has a fun environment, and cool staff. Really not a bad place to pregame it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, with quality food and drink. Fuzzy's is my \"go to\" on a taco Tuesday. Great ingredients as well as a full bar and margaritas to compliment your tacos. My only suggestion is to shy away from the later hours if you don't want to run into the late night college crowd."}
{"text":"I have to say Im disappointed. I had a friend in Kansas City hype up this place and maybe thats where I went wrong. First she said it was like a Wahoo's... Not even close! Not sure where to start with the disappointment...first off, there was not a speckle of fuzzy dust anywhere on the chips. Maybe thats just in KC but Im pretty sure the menu said they have this \"fuzzy dust.\" The queso reminded me of the nacho cheese out of the machine at a 7-Eleven gas station. No joke there was nothing in it. Just this weird nacho type cheese. The refried beans were strangely thick and oily looking/tasting. The chicken taco wasn't bad but the grilled fish taco seemed a bit odd in consistency. I don't know if the standards at this location are lower than others because its a college area or what the deal is...I will just leave it at that and probably wont go here even highly intoxicated. Taco bell would probably do the trick at that point. No go for me. I will add that the guy working there helping us was great! They have that going for them! Other than that pretty big disappointment."}
{"text":"Best taco place on Mill Ave! Their beer-garitas or the best and versatile, the staff is outgoing, super friendly, and really fast. Taco Tuesday is the best day to go! Their sandwiches are also really awesome."}
{"text":"awesome tacos on the cheap...killer weekday lunch spot. Fish tacos and shrimp tacos. Give it a try, its GOOD!"}
{"text":"I come here every time I go to Tempe. The tacos are good and the prices are really good for downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Taco spot in the city! We're here about 3 or 4 days a week its that good. Great price tacos, nachos, salads, and much more. Their frozen margaritas come in giant fish bowls for only $5! Over a dozen beers on tap. You can't go wrong. If you're looking for something new and delicious this is it!!"}
{"text":"The heat taco was good.  I had the shredded chicken it was good. Didn't care for the ground beef one. I'll have to try something else another time"}
{"text":"Tempura fish tacos are a must. Shredded chicken tacos are bomb also and make sure to get the chips and queso!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but wait time is ridiculous. Ordered a salad ahead of time at 8:59 said it'd be ready by 9:13 i arrived at 917 food wasn't ready so I waited until it was 9:20 then I asked the waitress if she could check on my order she said it'd be done in about a minute or two . At 9:35 I seen them prep the salad very sloppy and send it out. It also only had 4 pieces of shrimp. Wait time 35min, it took them 2min to make the salad and send it out."}
{"text":"Second visit, wanted to Love this place. On our first visit we dined in and was greeted by the cashier and recommended the brisket salad, loved that they actually gave you a huge salad in a mixing bowl! My boyfriend loved the brisket and it wasn't my favorite.  Second visit, we wanted those huge salads and walked in and no greeting, the staff wasn't friendly at all compared to the first time. Ordered salads again to go.. nothing fancy, half the size and hardly any protein.  Maybe it's only a place to dine in."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a club meet up on a Tuesday night.  The place was packed!  My husband ordered one of the sandwiches and I ordered two tacos and a side order of chips and salsa.  It took 45 minutes for us to get our food.  Although the food was good and really cheap, I will probably pick a less busy time to go here.  It wasn't really worth the 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"I came here during my lunch because Cafe Zupas was reeeallly busy. Here at fuzzys the refried beans taste like the ones from a can and I don't mess with frijoles from a can, the rice wasn't any better. After trying the beans and rice I wasn't expecting much from my shredded beff tacos but the meat was pretty good. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food this isn't the spot."}
{"text":"Shitty food long lines worst example of Mexican food I've had in phx I'll never be back"}
{"text":"Best Veggie Taco I had in my life! Period. Get it on a soft shell and put their own hot sauce, tell me of it ain't amazing! Oh and I made the bartender make me a Clamato spicy beer like in Mexico. Was amazing as well"}
{"text":"Fuzzy Taco is a nice , chill, inexpensive taco shop . If you're looking for the basic dishes , no frills with a casual environment this is your spot .   Perks: -TVs , like most wing spots you can catch sports here while earing tacos ... smart .  -Food: simple , tacos , burrito bowls , salads , quesilldias, kids menu , etc. Etc. The menu was vast .  ----We ordered the burrito bowls at 8.95 , the two taco plate with refried beans , and potatoes , and the kids quesilldia with cinnamon churros . All had flavor and all qas satisfying for my family of 4 , at only $32 . Not bad and 10times cheaper than chipotle. There was fresh cilantro and guac on our bowls .  There's an option of corn/ flour tortillas , or hard shell .  -Service , they are quick with food prep and they bring your meals out to you as well as clean the tables all with a cheerful attitude .   We will definitely visit again when we're craving  a simple , yet flavorful taco ..."}
{"text":"Always a tasty treat. The special ground beef has a flavorful kick. The manager delivered my order. Colorful decor."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to order some tacos and margaritas and relax. Although not gourmet, fuzzy's is a great option for happy hours and casual meals. The tacos and nachos are fun to share, and the margarita deals on certain days are not to be matched."}
{"text":"S/o to Trey who hooked up me and my boyfriend with the BEST guacamole side. The cooks were so quick it left us so pleased with the service. Thank you Tray for making out experience remarkable!! You rock"}
{"text":"Seriously get the tacos. I'm not a huge fan of tacos, but these are nothing short of amazing. The restaurant really sets a good vibe with good music. good television, and all their catchy tag-lines. Good ingredients, good food and good music, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Best to shop in town!! Fuzzy's is an ASU must-try, especially on Taco Tuesday's. California Heat Shrimp Taco is literally so amazing. Three tacos and a margarita (the sun devilrita is bomb) is the perfect food and drink combo. Bring your crew here to get a lil more than tipsy and a lot more than a satisfied tummy :)"}
{"text":"Staff is great, food is affordable, food is just ok. There is better Mexican food places in the area."}
{"text":"I love the vibe at Fuzzy's. Plus, the margaritas are huge! The quality of the food is pretty average, but I enjoy going there for more than the food. The location is also pretty rad. It's right on Mill Ave which is a hot spot near ASU."}
{"text":"After a few climbs up \"A\" mountain, I took the family for a walk in downtown Tempe. All of sudden all I hear.. \"I'm cravin a taco\", yeah me too, yeah me three... so here we are grabbing some tacos.   Menu is pretty straight fwd but you're thrown when you walk in knowing if it's a sit-down or order & sit. Place your order, find a spot and wait till the buzzer goes off... unless u order a drink (oh yeah, like a beer-rita or frozen margarita) then u get that from the counter next to where you ordered. Food orders are done at the opposite end of the entry and that's where you pick up.  We got a few different tacos (grilled & fried shrimp, a kids taco plate which included a side, churro and drink... not a bad price either for all that. Make sure u ask for items you want on a taco for a kid as they keep it basic... meat & cheese. Lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, etc...   The food was good and provided a variety for everyone but it didn't really knock your socks off like many other taco places in the valley. The one thing I did like was the Fuzzy seasoning added to chips. I needed a lot more of that on my food items as it had some good flavor for the chips.   The wait time can be a pain, but credit that to the menu and people being indecisive. Luckily we missed the rush, but I can see the hopes of people wanting their food quick.  I'll make my next trip during Taco Tues as they have specials that are cheap and I hear worth it."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. This place was really family friendly and folks that work there had a great attitude!! The food was fresh and the taste was amazing!!! Really like this place and I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"First of all, the shredded beef on hard shell taco's are awesome.   The Burritos are pretty good but I think Qdoba's down the street are better because the tortilla is steamed.  The main difference here is just how good the baja garlic sauce tastes in conjunction with the Butt Burning Sauce that is at every table.  I love hot sauce and this one doesn't pack much of a punch but the flavor is as good as it gets.  The taco's are only $1.99 and there are way more options on the menu than the place down the street.  The shrimp Tempura taco's are probably the best deal on the menu and are super tasty.   Overall, for the price, I give it a 4.5/5.  I'm really happy this place is in town!"}
{"text":"Great taco shop. Staff was extremely friendly. Nice Kid at the counter. Food was yummy. Nothing bad to say for the most part. In fact I would have given five stars however the place could have used some attention when it came to the tables, floor, and bathrooms but they were not what you would call Gross. So overall I would say pretty good experience. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Everything has the franchise touch on this and that's not a good thing just IMO. There's nothing that stands out when you eat here but the idea of how to run it is pretty admirable. I don't really think I'll be back to eat here I'm more of a mom n pop guy when it comes to any variation of Mexican food but the food was ok."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been eyeing this place to try it out. I ordered 3 hard shell tacos with sides of black beans, rice and a beer (served in a massive goblet). The tacos were mostly filled with lettuce and very little protein filling, but they were each under $3 so I can't complain too much but it did make me want to go home and make my own. The rice and beans were really salty, which is why you need all that beer! The peas in the Mexican rice were not fresh; shriveled like raisins.   Also the self service policy is not really clear, when your buzzer goes off you go up to the kitchen window and pick up your order. I wasn't sure since I saw the cashier go up there herself a few times. Felt kind of odd to do. Each taco was in a separate basket, that seemed like a waste. I wish there were hot sauce options that were mild, they're all way too hot.  Overall I'd probably try another place for tacos in the future. They have a lot of improvement to do."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had dinner here and let me tell you we will not be back.....if you are craving authentic Mexican food, don't go here everything tasted very processed and out of a can and over priced for a small amount of food......"}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to Madison!  I wasn't super hungry when I stopped in today, but by the time I left, I had eaten 5 extremely delicious tacos. My favorites were the shrimp tacos, fish tempura, and pulled pork. Wonderful combination of flavors!  I will definitely be back to explore more if the menu!!"}
{"text":"Before trying the steak quesadilla, I would've given this place a 3... this item has now become my go-to. I did enjoy the breakfast tacos prior to trying the quesadilla. I'm not a huge fan of their corn tortillas, but their flour tortillas and meats are quite good. Also, their infamous upside-down beer bottled margaritas are pretty satisfying. Another item on the menu that is often overlooked but worth getting, is the chips and queso - the chips are sprinkled with some sort of paprika powder... TASTY."}
{"text":"Boring food.  Wife and went for lunch. Service was excellent and the food brought out immediately.   Lots of TV's and drink options.  Reminded me of New Orleans with all the frozen drink machines they have.   The food was lacking, not bad, just glorified bar food.  The tacos needed flavor.  Fresh ingredients or even just a wedge of lime for some acid.   The Latin Potatoes were home fries and nothing more.  Nothing Latin at all about them. The Black Beans has some pico added, but still tasted like they were fresh from a can.  It's a bar that serves Mexican food, nothing special.  They do have good house brand hot sauces."}
{"text":"Not bad at anything, not great at anything.    Got a breakfast burrito, fajita plate, and the chips and queso.  All were more bland than expected.    On the fajita plate I got borracho beans and cilantro lime rice.  Beans were fine, glad i tried.  Rice was the most flavorful item.    I'll probably go to one of the 24 hour joints in the area next time I want a mex fix."}
{"text":"The fajita's were really small in portions and the wrap was dry. I found myself drowning my food in hot sauce to make it juicy and flavorful. Also tried their quesadilla but there'd were barely any chicken in it and a little scoop of sides, it was good but wish the food was more juicy not dry and more for what you pay. They do have soda cups that are reusable so if you buy a drink you could take it home to reuse instead of disposing of it."}
{"text":"Lets just say the only fish tacos ill put in my mouth is from Fuzzy's. Got the fried fish and corn tortilla and it was an orgasm in my mouth."}
{"text":"Fuzzin' awesome.  $1 tacos on Tuesdays!  Reasonable prices, excellent selection of draft beers, and friendly atmosphere. Great place for lunch or happy hour!"}
{"text":"Was not happy with my other I ask for brisket burrito and got more beans and rice it was not good the tortilla was cold like a wrap was not happy"}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is probably one of the best Mexican food places ever! I can't stress it enough how great their food is & their service! The management is insanely perfect! I literally love the manger, Wesley, so much! He is such a hard working person & I respect that so much when I walk into a place seeing that! Every time I walk in, no matter what time of the day it is, he is doing every single job there is to do! He is cooking, cleaning, serving, bar tending, at the cash register. Whatever it is you name it, he is there! The enchiladas, tacos & burritos are awesome! Coming from a real authentic Mexican, the food could not be any better! I highly recommend! Don't miss out on these amazing qualities the entire building carries, food, drinks, management, service, everything!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"BEST BEST BEST BEST tacos, service and everything else you could want. My husband and I adore this restaurant - it would be fair to say that fuzzys is our favorite, in fact. I always get brisket and he gets the chicken- paired with a pitcher of beer and you've got one seriously excellent meal. And the GM (christopher?) is wonderful to all guests and his employees. If I could, I would eat here 5 times a week!!"}
{"text":"I love Fuzzy's!!! If you are looking for good Tex Mex this is an awesome place to come kick back with a group of friends and have some beers and food! I always enjoy the food every time I come because it's good but also flavorful! I always tend to order the same thing but it's well worth it and I always leave full! I recommend their chips and salsa for a side! Amazing Salsa and the chips are a huge helping full! They also offer plastic soda cups that if you bring them back you get a discount the next visit. I never do because I end up using them to wash my dog! Haha kinda a cool little perk! I wish they would open up closer to the northwest side of town! I hate driving all the way across town for it!"}
{"text":"Cheap beer!  I was really drunk when I had the nachos and I got very excited when they passed me the mountain of chips at the pick up window.  Im going to say they were good, but a little plain.  The cashier was friendly as well."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this place to open.  The quesadilla was good.  The garlic sauce set the taste apart from other places.  My daughter had the chicken nachos and said the chicken was seasoned well.  My husband got the grilled vegetable salad.  He was expecting grilled veggies but was told the carrots, black beans, tomatoes were the grilled veggies.  He'll try the fajita veggies next time.  That is the only reason for the 4 stars.  The grilled veggies was a little misleading."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to Fuzzy's,it was great. The service was wonderful and friendly,the ambience was very inviting. Loved the music and I met the owner very sweet.Food was also great. Will definitely be returning also great drink deals."}
{"text":"I live fairly close to Mill Avenue so it surprises me I never actually branched out to more of the eateries on Mill, but I'm glad I did! Fuzzy's is definitely going to be one of my favorites thus far; fresh food, generous portions (I had to get a to-go box), clean and not overly busy for a Friday night. Friendly staff, amazing cooks, and over all pleased with my visit. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a nice gem in the middle of Mill. The wait staff is always friendly and knowledgable. With all the hecticness that surrounds Mill ave this is a quiet place to chill with friends. They serve food until the wee hours of the morning, and is quite delicious.  The beer on tap is a relatively inexpensive for the size of glass you receive. There is plenty of seating both inside and out. The ambiance reminds me of a local mom and pop place where you always feel welcome and at home...without the family arguments ;)"}
{"text":"I love Fuzzy's! It's my favourite place in Tempe! So yummy and great for groups of friends for lunch, or after a night out on Mill."}
{"text":"Believe this is the first Mexican restaurant I've been to that charges for salsa, sour cream and jalapeños.  $0.50 for a small sauce cup worth. *cheap* The only thing that's free is the limes and lemons. Yes, I know it's not an authentic Mexican restaurant, but still! Next time going to Chipotle or Qdoba instead. Free salsa all the way!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken tacos and the brisket tacos...no flavor on any of the meat, so I was a little disappointed...they're ok for taco Tuesday for lunch."}
{"text":"Well.. I stumbled up Fuzzy's after raging at the Global Dance fest all night while under the influence of of alcohol a few weeks ago. Tacos always sound good after a night of drinking.  Fuzzy's did not disappoint. I had literally 7 tacos 3 chicken 2 beef 1 breakfast taco and a pancake taco.   Let me tell you.. yes! that pancake taco was AMAZING. Go there for that alone..  Next time I'm down here and I want to get my taco fix this will be my first stop.    Definitely worth checking out but be warned it can and does get busy so there may be a little wait for your food especially if it's after 8pm on a weekend."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once week.  I adore this place!  There are plenty of choices, the quality is outstanding, everything is delicious, and they have the best nachos I've ever eaten.  The staff are friendly and go above and beyond to make sure I have a great dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple for my girlfriend and I since we moved here a little more than a year ago.  We admittedly only come on Taco Tuesday's but whatever.  $2 Large Goblets of PBR all day, everyday and $1.50 tacos, they are worth every penny even at  full price of $2.49.   Nice atmosphere and everyone working is usually pretty friendly. The only compliant I would have is that the front counter girls are a bit too nice. There is no reason for the entire line to be held up so someone can call their friend (via cellphone) from the patio to bring her ID up so the other on can buy more than one beer. Send that mess to to back of the line, really.  As for the tacos: Steak, YES Fish, YES Shrimp, YES Pork, YES  That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Always love coming to Fuzzys and now that they have online ordering it makes it a breeze to order ahead and still eat when you get there!"}
{"text":"If you want to visit this place, do it now. I do not think they will be around for long.   What looks cool from the outside, amounts to nothing more than an oversized Qdoba. Despite being empty, this place had a few dirty tables and a dirty floor, a real bad image for a place that just opened.   The menu seems appetizing but the food just doesn't deliver. I purchased a burrito for $8+ and it was terrible. A cold, a stale tortilla with a meager amount of meat and loads of rice was all I got. Barely any flavor, it was a mush of ingredients.   Do not stop by this place. You can eat anywhere ele in this strip mall and get way more for your buck."}
{"text":"Gourmet tacos! Reasonably priced. Tex-mex style foods. Fuzzy dust is just adorable. Crowd is hip & college students."}
{"text":"Love this place. I would come here all the time if I didn't live on the other side of town. I literally drive 30 minutes to get here. My girlfriend reminded the franchise from when she lived in Texas. She made me come here one time and now we make it standard trip multiple times a month. Can not get enough. Come and order anything literally anything."}
{"text":"I have never heard of this place before stopping in on a weekend and I absolutely loved it! A friend and I walked down Mill after experiencing the super long lines at a festival at Tempe Beach Park and were getting hangry, so we stopped in here for some tacos and a drink. No regrets! Per another customer's recommendation I ordered the chicken baja tacos and they were awesome, plus their signature frozen mango drink (Fuzzy Driver I want to say?) and it was really good as well, plus only $5 for quite a big glass of it! If you're on Mill Ave and unsure of where to go, I would stop by here for sure."}
{"text":"An appointment I had ran late into lunchtime and I was starving. Walked outside and saw Fuzzy's Taco Shop. What a find!  Ordered the Taco Plate - 2 tacos, 2 sides. The beer comes in a generous fishbowl. The place is clean and you can see the employees constantly washing their hands as they changed stations. They are all attentive and polite. Chris, the manager, was very accommodating when I wanted to change one of my tacos. My sides were cilantro-lime rice and black beans. I could have made a meal of that because it was so delicious. Clearly this is a popular spot as the lunchtime crowd poured in the whole time I was there. The atmosphere was lively and the music enjoyable. Breakfast is served all day and the choices are tempting.  I would definitely recommend Fuzzy's to fill your Mexican Food needs. It is one of the many gems of Las Vegas. Some of my best meals have been trying something off the cuff instead of planning and researching. Fuzzy's is definitely one of them. Putting this place on repeat. A high honor coming from me."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is one of my fav places on Mill. They have a great selection of mexican food at very low prices. Amazing drink specials, really friendly staff, and a great location! I have been here a few times with a friend late on a Fri night when needing something to eat. The service was quick, the food was hot and really really good. It exceeded my expectations. I hope Fuzzy's stays on Mill for years to come."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this location. The food was good, fresh and came out fast. The staff was nice and cleared our table quickly.   My main problem was that either the order didn't get correctly passed on to the kitchen or the kitchen didn't care. Because I asked for no cheese on my food, because I am allergic, and when I got my food I found shredded cheese that had been melted and was stuck on the tortilla. So I had to pick it all off which wasn't how I wanted to spend my lunch.   The food was good, but I just hope next time they pay more attention. Specifically asking for things NOT to be on my food is because I have an allergy, not because I'm a picky eater."}
{"text":"Nice employees and good food.  We tried this place for the first time today and will be back. We had the shredded chicken taco, shredded brisket taco and ground beef taco. They were all very good. They have TVs and a full bar which is an added bonus. Not sure what the other people are talking about in their reviews, we loved this place. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I had a bad experience here. Long story short my tacos weren't quite up to snuff. The important part is that they took care of it with a smile and other than that one time they food is on point. You'll definitely see me back in for that garlic sauce sometime soon"}
{"text":"Hubby and I have a day off and decided to walk mill Ave in Tempe to try and find a breakfast spot. fuzzy tacos was it! Amazing service, ambiance and food. Absolutely loved it!! Will definitely be hitting that place up again!"}
{"text":"I've been to fuzzy's multiple times on mill. And it it amazing, witch is why I drive from central PHX all the way to Mill Ave in Tempe for more. But I wanted to try out there new location on 44th st. And Thomas , guess what.... Still amazing and great customer service . They came up consistently  asking if they could get me anything or if I was enjoying my food. Either way , I recommend going to either location!!!! A++ in my book!"}
{"text":"Quite noisy but a very nice place to have dinner. I love the veggie tacos and the delicious bean and cheese nachos here. The taco sauce is great and so are the people."}
{"text":"Finally made it down to this location and took my bf with after months of raving about this place only to be a bit disappointed. My first time trying fuzzys was at the Thomas location(which originally made me fall in love with their \"special\"-ground beef taco) which is unfortunately closed. We ordered the \"special\" ground beef tacos(nothing special), ground beef nachos, quesdilla, and brisket soft taco. The ground beef tacos were skimped on the garlic sauce which makes the taco great however the ones we had on this location were not, the nachos weren't bad as well as the quesdilla, the most horrible was the brisket taco not because the brisket itself but the presentation and assembly- the \"soft\" shell was served cold and hard and all the ingredients that go onto the taco seem as if they were just tossed from a left field. The cashier could use a crash course in how to casually dress as she was wearing daisy dukes and a smedium tank when she was clearly a large i mean i know that its college town in that particular area but at 12pm on a Saturday i went to eat not see a peep show. Overall im disappointed in this location and dont plan on visiting again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good tacos, like really tasty! I like the large beers. Probably the only restaurant to make it on that corner of Mill Avenue. I like the simplicity of this place. You order at the door and they give you a number and bring out the food when it's ready."}
{"text":"Tried this place with some co-workers for the first time this past week for lunch. I liked the overall layout of the place. They give you a buzzer once they take your order and it buzzes once your food is ready for you pick it up yourself from the kitchen window when it's hot off the grill. I had the shredded chicken nachos which were very good. The serving size was huge and the prices was even better compared to other places that I've dined at. If I had to say anything bad about my experience here I would say the parking is very limited because it's in an area with other eateries. It took about 10 minutes to find a a place to park. All in all it was a good meal and I look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere.  Nice selection of beer on tap at a very fair price."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. Today was my first time eating at this place. I asked for fajita nachos with extra chicken which I paid an additional $2.50 for. I received barely any sauce and almost no chicken. I literally ate about five or six chips before all of the chicken and sauce was gone. I won't be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Solid choice if you want a quick meal, especially if you want to watch sports , including the slightly less mainstream stuff like golf, women's bball, and soccer.  They do give you a lot of options when you order (3 different shells, many different sides, etc) so you can customize your order.  The only food I didn't like was the guacamole, which is bulked up with lettuce. I like the garlic shredded beef and tempura fish, as well as occasionally the enchiladas.  I find the quality to be the same as a good deal of the sit-down Mexican restaurants in Madison.  I recommend the borracho beans for sides, which is well flavored with thick pieces of bacon.  The vinegar based hot sauce is enough to add some heat but still tolerable enough to sprinkle liberally on your food."}
{"text":"Kind of a Mexican style atmosphere. Larger menu then I thought. Awesome drinks and amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Totally epic fail! I don't know if it was because we went between lunch and dinner rush but everything was wrong. First, my tacos had burnt shrimp. Not just overcooked burnt brown all the way through. When they replaced it they were now undercooked and drenched in oil. They also call it tempura shrimp, and it's not, it's frozen popcorn shrimp like you get in a frozen kids meal.My friend got the combo and his taco shell was completely raw and stale and his shrimp were cold pre-cooked salad shrimp that were coated in a seasoning. They might have been ran under hot water but they never got close to any grill. Then the beans are canned beans that taste like they have been sitting in a warmer since Monday, and the rice tastes like one of those Uncle Bens microwave packs.  The only redeeming thing was the queso, but it never solidified, which means it was fake cheese. If you are too lazy to make Old El Paso at home, then you might like it. Otherwise spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped back in here the other evening around 8:30 or so. I was pretty hungry and it was Tuesday so I got 3 tacos and an order of latin potatoes. I got a grilled fish, a tempura fish, and a shredded beef taco and all were fantastic. Once again they were very large tacos and the longest part of the wait was the huge line to get to order because it was taco Tuesday on ASU campus. The potatoes were pretty good too will likely order them all again. Would recommend to anyone trying to get their taco fix."}
{"text":"1st time here and let me say not impressed with the service and food! Right when we walked in we waited awhile before someone finally greeted us, and all we can stare at are her hickied covered neck! Lol. So professional. We sat down and waited, and noticed the bartender(?) put cups over her ear/hair while talking to her co workers and then put them back on the shelf! (Where are the managers?!) seems like teenagers running the place. I ordered the \"jumbo\" shredded chicken burrito, and let me say you can get so much more for 7 bucks at chipotle and taste way better. My burrito taste way to salty, no flavor whatsoever! Just go to Taco Bell and get a soft taco you'll get the same product taste for a cheaper price. \"Welcome to your new addiction\"  No thanks I'll pass and stick to chipotle with good service and food!"}
{"text":"Dirty table, dirty silverware, and their margaritas are water downed vile concoctions.  Their fajita beef tacos were very good. The rice and refried beans are tasteless.  Only in a college town could a place like this stay open.  They need to change the name to \"only eat the tacos\"..."}
{"text":"We went to Fuzzy's for lunch yesterday and  based upon my first experience I am not a fan.  I actually would return to drink beer or try a margarita before I would go back for the food.  The starter was chips and guacamole...not sure why they need to sprinkle chips with anything just make good fresh chips however guacamole was okay.  I tried ground beef nachos and they were meh.  I had migas which were okay but my fish taco was crunchy with hardly any fish.  Lastly, what is up with being given the light/buzzer and then I have to go to the kitchen window for my food where multiple orders are up and I have to ask which tray/order is mine? A worker brought our chips and guac so why not ditch the nasty light/buzzers and just call out order number or bring out the food."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and plentiful.  My first visit was for a fajita burrito and it was great.   A small oil tanker sized burrito made to order.  The order taker was very friendly and helpful in guiding me through the menu. The burrito was quite tasty and had some great flavors.  Another in our party had the tacos and enjoyed a similar experience.    My second visit was similar to the first with the exception of my enjoyment of the food.  I got the beef nachos and they we just ok.  The flavors were muted and the cheese was just queso cheese poured over the top.  It was also just mediocre.  I will go back to the burritos and tacos next time.    The place is squeaky clean and the decor is funky. If there is one drawback to this location, it has to be the parking lot. There are a large number of lunch spots in this strip center and locating a parking spot is a chore."}
{"text":"The brisket burrito is delicious I love it! However, I have been sitting waiting for my food to be ready. I came in at 8:35 pm and still waiting for my food, it's 8:55pm. And dead inside..."}
{"text":"This is, I'm afraid, medriocre and inauthentic Mexican food. The brisket in the torta, which they call a sandwich, was bland and the added avocado slices were browning. Couldn't finish it. Served with potatoes that double for breakfast home fries, and dry ones at that. Tacos offered in hard shells? Might as well go to Taco Hell. Tried a burrito another time and it will also be my last. Sadly, two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's Tacos is my family's new fav! Great prices, great food, friendly staff, very clean, and did I mention $5 margaritas and $4 beer! My family and I are vegetarians and their veggie soft tacos are some of the best we've ever had! Definitely check it out and thank me later."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience at fuzzy's . Good Mexican food is hard to come by in Las Vegas and I was hopeful that this could be our new Mexican restaurant. The chicken was on the dry side and the guac needed salt so bad. The portion size for a side of guac was on the minuscule side.     I am currently dairy free and I told the girl taking my order that I was, so I didn't want anything dairy on the tacos and sure enough they come out with a dairy based sauce under all the chicken that I only noticed halfway through one taco. Thankfully I am not allergic but I am nursing a baby who was sensitive to dairy so I was frustrated by that.   The restaurant is clean and if you have a big group of people that you need seating for this place would easily facilitate that over another Mexican place in town.   I cannot speak to anything else on the menu since I judge a Mexican place by their tacos that's all we ended up getting and we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, but expensive for the amount you get.  The three times I've been here, they have always screwed up my order or the order of the person I'm with.  I contacted the owner about this, and he offered me a gift card which I never got.  Lastly, the TVs are so loud you can't hold a decent conversation.  But the food is pretty good.  That's about it."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere.   Only complaint  - the food was not hot enough (fire hot) for my taste."}
{"text":"I come here every Tuesday and it never fails to please me. All I can suggest is that they rearrange the patio so the smokers have more room, further away from the non smokers so everyone can enjoy their dining to the full extent!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night and ordered a beef fajita burrito. My buddy ordered ground beef tacos. Nothing spectacular, but it's hard to completely mess up tacos and burritos. Place is a little over priced in my opinion. It's a good place to eat after a night of drinking because it's convenient but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for Mexican food."}
{"text":"I was in town for the afternoon and was looking for some tacos.  And I ended up here.  I was greeted by Lily who was very kind and patient in explaining the menu to me.  I decided to go with a platter consisting of two chicken tacos, with the cilantro lime rice and the fried potatoes.  And I got the large souvenir cup (good for dollar refills on return visits).  The good:  The rice was fantastic and the potatoes were pretty good as well. The bad: The tacos were mediocre.  I liked the garlic sauce, but could have done without everything else (for the record, I'm a corn tortilla, onions and cilantro taco guy).  I would consider stopping back the next time I'm town so that I can get some more of that rice."}
{"text":"was there today, had grilled shrimp burrito, after 15 min wait finally came out, but it was cold, small, and it had at least 4 microscopic to miniature size shrimp in it for $11 dlls whit drink included, you couldn't be more skimpy, but there was a bunch of rice in it, menu is pricy, no salsa bar, wich is a must in all mexican taquerias, this taqueria is already feeling the \"hammer\" of fierce competition, whit those prices will not compete at all. not much mexican about this taqueria, the name, not even the cooks. one las thing  the salsa has a little bit of buildup at the tip."}
{"text":"Their shrimp tacos and fish tacos are pretty weak, but their beef tacos and their pork tacos are pretty good."}
{"text":"Great for vegetarians, and my carnivorous friends appear to love it too. Great atmosphere and food is delicious. Sometimes the staff on the register can be a bit unfriendly but the other staff, e.g. bussers and folks in the back are really very nice. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love Fuzzy's in Dallas and St. Louis. The food, service and atmosphere are great.   I feel that when great food places from out of state decide to come to Las Vegas, they usually get a bad rap. Mainly because of the service and quality of food. This Fuzzy's is just ok. The atmosphere is meh. I definitely prefer this chain in other states. The employees and service are better. I hope they improve this establishment with some time. There is a good opportunity here.   With that all being said, I will likely come back here when I need the Drunken Pig fix."}
{"text":"Amazing service ! Stopped by for my first time and the gentleman was very polite and recommended some favorites! I ended up getting their delicious chicken quesadilla and a refreshing blue moon beer! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I was showing my mom and dad around mill while they were here visiting, and after awhile we were hungry, and needed a break and a drink. ( hey it's hard work going In and out of all those stores!) So we were walking by, and decided to check it out. First of all, the beer served In the huge margarita glasses is an awesome Idea, even though I couldn't finish it. I got the soft chicken tacos, and my parents both got the shredded beef.  They both really liked theirs, and mine were great as well. Loved the cilantro and feta! Bartender was funny and we all really liked this place! I'll be back with friends after hittin up Urban Outfitters!"}
{"text":"I'm a very picky person when it comes to fish tacos, so I'm going to try and review this place as fairly as possible.  PROS: -I went here for Taco Tuesday--which has deals that are difficult to beat. -The staff were very friendly and efficient. -You have an option to get these tacos \"crispy\" or soft.  CONS: -The fish tacos were very good.  I can't say much about the chicken taco I had. -Crispy isn't what I thought it was--instead it's just a hard shell, and I'm not a fan of that. -The hot sauce is not hot enough.  FOUR STAR!!!"}
{"text":"Food is just ok. That and the cashier's friendly personality gets them the 2 stars. As an operation though, they fail. I've been seating outside for 45 minutes. Two tables had left, girl came picked up some plates and the tip left in the tables.....but NEVER cared to wipe the tables. A family of 5 came and the mom cleaned the table herself!  she also had to move the remaining plates to an adjacent table. That is UNACCEPTABLE!!! Your customers are cleaning your place. I see several employees not doing much, the girl that picked up the tip is slower than molases, and the guy on the blue shirt, who appears to be the manager doesn't notice anything. He obviously has no management experience or desire to see this place succeed. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Spicy pork Taco with soft shell, crispy fish taco soft shell, and black beans.....you're welcome.  Tacos and garnish always fresh.  Cold huge beers super cheap.  It gets busy yes, but service is always friendly.  Great speaking I also on drink refills and return customer rewards."}
{"text":"Been here before fell in love with the flavors.   So much that I had to buy the sauce. The tacos come out crispy. They are consistant on my visits. Went on taco day $1. Tad skimp but I'm bias cause I'm from #Texas. But still flavorful. #thatsauce tho."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty good, compared to other 'fast' mill ave eateries.  I like the flavor of the tacos, with the feta and garlic sauce stuff. It gives it an almost Greek taste, which I like.   Also, the tacos are super cheap and pretty big.   I can't really compare them to other Mexican food places, because I don't think they're typical 'Mexican', considering I'm an Az native...  All in all, I like them. I think they're unique!"}
{"text":"The food is ok it's sub par TexMex something to the tune of a homemade attempt at Taco Bell. Really wish it would have had something that would make me want to come back I've tried this place 3 times as I like to give a place a few chances. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"New place in town took forever to finish finally open. It was nice inside with a decent menu. Prices were great. Staff was pleasant and attentive. Ordered for sit down got a pager grabbed a table about a 10 minute wait for the food. We got the Nachos as an appetizer it had a large bowl of queso cheese to dip in and it was good. I got the Baja chicken tacos on a crunchy shell and I was slightly disappointed with the chicken. The taste and flavor was so so. We also got a chicken quesadilla which was better over all granted it just opened okay but I won't rush back either."}
{"text":"**Edit: I upped my review to 4 stars after actually eating the meal. I still think it took long and didn't have enough chicken, but the food was delicious.   First time trying Fuzzy's. It was...ok. The cashier was very friendly and they got my custom order correct. I ordered a chicken burrito bowl. It took 10 minutes and didn't have as much chicken as I would have liked. I'd stick to Chipotle."}
{"text":"If you like tacos, you'll love Fuzzys. They have great tacos and large, strong margaritas!  Prices are great, making the shop a hit with the college kids. A great place to hit up after a couple of drinks as well.   I only have two problems with Fuzzys: the parking because Mill Ave sucks with that and the ASU gear decorating the place. Go eat here, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a drink with friends that is not crazy ghetto like all other mill ave bars. The drinks are reasonably priced and food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"We can't ever go wrong eating here!! Love love the shredded brisket tacos with their chips & queso. The atmosphere and price can't be beat. A taste from Texas each time we go."}
{"text":"I ordered the taco plate: shredded chicken taco, ground beef taco, refried beans and Mexican rice. For $7 it was a pretty good size. The beans were really dry and thick; I had to dump taco sauce on them to eat them. The rice had a good flavor, not heavy/sticky at all. The tacos were good but nothing special. The meat wasn't anything unique.   The place is busy but it's on a college campus so I wasn't surprised. The place is nasty, though. The bathrooms are filthy, smelling like an outhouse. The stone floors aren't maintained. However it looks like I might be the only customer not drinking alcohol so that explains a lot."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Pretty cheap. I would recommend trying their queso or guacamole and a few tacos (my favorite is the shredded beef). The hot sauce is really hot, so be careful if you have a sensitive stomach.  Fuzzy's reminds me of home because I grew up in Dallas and ate Fuzzy's when it started getting really good. It isn't the best I've ever had, but if you need a quick, cheap, fairly tasty meal, this is a good place to try."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good fish taco since coming back from CA. and having an amazing one there. The fish was cooked nicely but other than that it was pretty basic. No really good flavor to pull it all together. Looking at others plates it looks  good but not sure if I'll be back to try it."}
{"text":"Great \"Bang for Buck\" fun place on Mill ave! Whether you're looking for some great food after running the trails around Tempe Town Lake, watching an ASU game, or just wanting to eat in a thriving area, Fuzzy's Taco Shop will give you, well, that special \"Fuzzy\" feeling! Right on the southwest corner of W 4th St and Mill Ave., you can feast on their mouth watering tacos, burritos, breakfasts, and salads while gazing into the endlessly sunny Mill Ave and \"A\" Mountain activities. Going to bars with friends and in need of a break from your 100ft walk to the next bar? Dip into Fuzzy's and quench your thirst on their oasis of beers and margaritas...responsibly, of course! This is a straight-up friendly, fun, and delicious place that will leave your wallet, taste buds, and fun side saying \"THANK YOU!!!\""}
{"text":"To give this place a fair assessment we made two visits.  The place is roomy and the staff is very friendly.  The portions are small and the amount of protein (meat) in any dish even smaller.  Flavor is unremarkable.   A word of advise if you try it too:  1. Check your silverware closely.  On both visits we found numerous pieces of cutlery with food residue caked on.  Not 2 or 3 dirty items but more like 10.  One spoon was totally encrusted with refried beans.  We mentioned this to staff and they were very apologetic but we saw no one actually address the issue. 2.  Familiarize yourself with the item descriptions.  A management type person served our entrees and failed to include the tortillas and salsa that are part of the meal. It took me a moment to realize this and I went back and read the menu board to see if I was mistaken about what my order included.  I was not.  I can see a new server overlooking this but management ought to be more familiar."}
{"text":"I am not sure how to review this place. I would give it a 4 for drinks/the bar. The drinks are CHEAP and you aren't paying a cover on Mill Avenue.  But the food? I'd give a 1. Who puts lettuce in Guacamole? 2. BLAND, Cold, and Generic. They give you a bottle of \"Blow out your colon-hot\" or some such at your table...but I want flavor, not an inopportune trip to the bathroom.  Even Filberto's is better if you want cheap, fast Mexican. I feel like the people who give it great reviews were drunk when they walked in and ordered to begin with.  The people who work here are really nice, though, and I'll probably stumble in here a few more times because it's on Mill."}
{"text":"Great service and a fun place to grab some tacos and a margarita and people watch all the interesting folks on mill ave. Also Eric the bartender is awesome, makes string drinks and a sweetheart! Would recommend stopping by :)"}
{"text":"@fuzzystacoshop is headed to the Dirty Dining segment on Ch 13 KTNV.   There tonight with my family, Tuesday 6PM. The tray my tacos were delivered in had OLD MEAT, some gross pulled pork (I ordered fish), that looked partially washed, even FUZZY.  Fuzzy's taco shop, literally.   I brought it up to the counter and said, \"Take the old meat out before you use a tray again\", and they said NOTHING to me. No apology, nothing, went back to my seat to get the kids, and no one said a word.  Not only is it filthy, they don't care."}
{"text":"Dope!!!!! Great customer service and the Tempura Fish tacos.... Omgggg delish I will definitely be returning for drinks soon."}
{"text":"Darned good tacos! I'd heard so much about Taco Tuesday at this place, I had to duck in when I found myself near there.  Holy Mackeral! 1.50 Tacos? Are you kidding me? ($1.99 normal days).  I like to honor what the place does on first trial.  I figured I'd try three tacos; one shredded beef, one shredded pork, and a fish. The souveneir cup seemed like a wise choice for 1.99, with endless refills from the fountain. I was working so no drinky drink, but the college kids seemed to be enjoying all sorts of margies with beers tipped into them and huge frosty schooners of God knows what. I'll have to go back for that.  The tacos were excellent. I probably liked the beef about the best, with the pork a close second, and there was certainly nothing wrong with the fish taco either. They are served \"Baja style\", so there's fresh tomato, lettuce, cilantro, and feta cheese, which imitates some of the hard mexican cheeses quite deliciously. I'll come back, often.  There's 8 or 12 beers on tap, including Corona which you never see. The decor is what you'd expect, multi colored swag in beer themes and school colors so you don't forget you're at ASU, should you have too many frosty margs.  I wouldn't bring the kids, though you certainly can. The music's loud, the vibe is college, and the beverages are flowing. I'm tickled to have found this place!"}
{"text":"This joint is cool to visit. The area around Tempe is beautiful and the food is good here and customizable. The beer-Rita is worth a try and the overall scene is fun to experience"}
{"text":"Right off the bat one of young girls taking orders gave us a big smile and sweet hi. Not a phony welcome to CiCis hello. A genuine friendly hi. And then the girl who took our order was just as nice and very helpful. We all ordered and headed for a table. Our food was there in about 2 minutes. Great timing!  Now for the food. Finally, a restaurant not afraid to use some spice. Not too much, but really favorable. And the folks cleaning up were right there, clearing as we went. This was a great first experience."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's is in a sea of similar style restaurants. And, at least at this location, they failed to excecute. We walked in and the cashier was nice and friendly. The menu was a little too much, but the choices were good. So you order, they give you a pager, then you pick up the food from the counter inside. We sat in the outside seating area and had to look through most of the 25 our so tables to find one that was clean enough for use. Many of the tables were not bussed. And, it stayed that way through our entire visit. We watched the manager talking to each of the employees at length, but never getting one of them to do a little cleaning. The food was ok. The chips and queso was pretty good. Nothing exciting or worth writing about. Our 5 year old complained and compared it to several of this restaurants competitors. If the location was great or they had the best service or it was clean, they might have a shot. But no, mediocre everything and a management style that matched. Will not return to this and expect to see a for lease sign on the space within 12-18 months."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service from the management and the entire team is incredible, they are super accommodating and they even have an app for the iPhone.  Try the Butt burnin' hot sauce! It's my favorite! Very friendly staff, I have since returned for my 3rd visit with my wife, we absolutely LOVE the food here!"}
{"text":"So this was my first lunch outing at my new job and this place was selected since it is the boss' favorite. I got the shredded beef tacos and they were pretty good. The beans and rice were just ok, though. Next time I'll order ala carte instead of getting the plate meal. Even with all that food it was pretty cheap, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Fuzzy taco shop, was just ok! Nothing special kind of plane. We ordered grilled fish and shrimp tacos **, shredded brisket and pork tacos ** Beef nachos ** were  very plain would preferred to pay one dollar more and get more meat! It really need more meat. The Jalapeño Bottlecaps was the only good thing about this place. Service ****."}
{"text":"My friends and I are in Arizona for the first time for a football tourney, so we hit this place to get some grub. never in my life will I ever come back here. The \"jumbo\" burrito is no where near that, Calling it TINY, is being nice. The burrito was tasteless and a waste of money. Food was horrible, the ID laws here suck, pretty much Arizona sucks in general! Cali over Arizona any day and twice on sundays!"}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck, informal, and delicious food. Good margaritas and helpful staff. Good rewards program. A Mill staple."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today and the workers were all very nice and the place was clean.. There were just some small things that could use a boost..  1. Ordered a children's meal with two sides and a drink.. the kids cup they gave did not have a lid so they gave us a regular cup for free. That was the good part but when we got his food, one of the sides was missing. The oreo churro which was the other side, looked like two long poops on a plate and he didn't  even want to try it  2. The food looked incredibly delicious on the menu and in person but actually eating it, it tasted like it should have been made at a senior center. It was incredibly bland and I had to put a bunch of hot sauce on it just to add flavor.   3. The refried beans I honestly believe came from a can..   I'd probably come back in a year just to try it out again, hopefully it would be better next time"}
{"text":"Fun little dive of a place. I liked their fried potatoes. The price is reasonable and you get a lot of food but not too much, as is the problem with many Mexican places. The food is not great but not the worse either. More of a beach feel to the whole place. My only complaint, and it is a big one so listen up owners, is that the place was pretty dirty. I once read that you should never eat at a place that has a dirty bathroom. The bathroom was disgusting. Also the counters were very dirty. Even the creamers were left uniced and had stains on them. What's up with that? The restaurant was dead at the time we left so that did not make sense to me."}
{"text":"My friends and I love coming here for lunch. Food is cheap and always good. (I love the tacos!) Margaritas are pretty sugary, but huge.  It is a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I went to this little establishment after church this evening and the first thing I would like to point out is that they were very ill-equipped to deal with more than 20 people especially with only 2 cashiers. We warned them days in advance that we would have a huge group coming and they thought offering us free chips and salsa would help. The manager was nowhere to be found and I believe that it's their job to be helping the employees out. It took about 20 minutes to get through the line with all of my friends and I ordered the shredded brisket tacos. When I got it, I thought it was a joke because I ordered 2. I quickly realized that they were small flour tortillas that you could make yourself at home. $2.99 is a rip off in my opinion for 2 small flour tortillas. I'm going to give them one more chance since the only good thing about this place was the $4 Shiner Bock that they served in a goblet. That was very refreshing and make it worth my while. :)"}
