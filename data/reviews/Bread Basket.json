{"text":"I've eaten here and the food was pretty good but I went there today and the sign said that they are now open until 5pm :( I will update this review when they fix their hours on Yelp. It was very disappointing to drive all the way out here to find the hours were wrong and I missed them by 5 minutes"}
{"text":"Got the Lunch For Two deal through Groupon. I had the turkey cranberry sandwich. Awesome! Turkey, cranberry cream cheese, some kind of herb spread on 9 grain bread. To die for. Now, I LOVE bread. So, since we're in a bakery we decide to buy some truly fresh bread. My wife picked the cranberry orange. Delicious. I picked the jalapeno cheese. It is exceptional! But the best of the best is the spinach feta. That's right, I said SPINACH FETA. Sinfully good. They don't have the spinach feta every day so call ahead to find out if it's available. This is a true family business, and the great quality of their products is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Their scones are my favorite. Full of fresh fruits. So soft. Perfect like a real scone should be. The cookies are yummy - never hard. The coconut pie has the best flaky crusts. It reminds me of my grandmother's."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous turkey cranberry and special herb sauce sandwich. Raspberry cinnamon roll, sugar cookie, oatmeal cookie...great food great prices great people! Looking forward to our next trip to the Bread Basket and Pies!"}
{"text":"I will start my review by saying that Google has it in the wrong place... It is actually in the North East corner of University Dr and Lindsay Rd. Look for it... It is very much worth it. When you walk in it is very obvious that this is a family owned establishment. The service is very friendly and the staff is very attentive.  The first time I went, I bought a loaf of cranberry orange bread (amazing vehicle for a breakfast sandwich with an egg over medium, Havarti cheese and fresh tomatoes, onions and avocado), 2 regular cinnamon rolls, 2 blueberry cinnamon rolls and 2 sugar cookies... All baked that day! All the baked goods were amazing! Very with it! I used a Local Flavor deal of $20 for $10. The second time I also used the same deal and treated myself to their raspberry cinnamon rolls (I am working very hard at not eating them all right now). Please visit this place and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack while in the area. Decided to try a lemon bar, sugar cookie, and cinnamon roll.  We also sampled the chocolate chip cookie.  The staff was very friendly and the prices were very reasonable.  The food was good and we are definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! My family and I were very happy with Bread Basket and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Hidden little gem. All of their bread is made from scratch and have yet to try one that doesn't taste absolutely amazing. I have been going here for about a year now and honestly is one of my favorite places to go and have a sandwich. The food is healthy,  and the place is very clean. Every employee in the management are super nice and always offer samples of about anything that we are looking at. I strongly recommend Bread Basket for lunch."}
{"text":"This is a delightful bakery & eatery! Their cinnamon rolls are amazing & they make to order a wide variety of delicious baked goods!  We love the goodies from this great locally own bakery!"}
{"text":"I found this gem of a bakery about a month ago! Having movex to Arizona, three years ago I'd given up on finding a homestyle bakery! Look no further! The owner is involved and the staff provides great customer service! So, if you want a bakery that makes things like mom did or does, this is your place!! Breads, pies, cookies and treats, there's none better! Whether you live in Mesa or Phoenix, it's very much worth the drive to Bread Basket & Pies!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time and we loved it! They were extremely friendly and offered us samples of the brownie, white bread, jalepeno cheese bread, and muffin!  They answered all of our questions and helped us decide on a plethora of baked goods! The cinnamon roll and the sugar cookie were our favorite! Fabulous customer service, a lovely shop and tasty baked goods made this visit a delight! Next time we are coming back for sandwiches on their fresh baked bread!"}
{"text":"The people here are so nice and the food is very reasonably priced!  They had a great selection of bread, pastries, and desserts.  I thought they had forgotten to ring something up when I saw the total price, but they confirmed they got everything.  What a great place!"}
{"text":"Great home made breads. I loved the banana bread and cinnamon buns. The home made muffins are great with strawberry jams."}
{"text":"Best lunch spot around!  Owners are very friendly, sandwiches are amazing and super fresh. Prices are reasonable. They also sell fresh made breads, cookies and other great baked goods. The best part is they have a point system so you can earn money off or free loads of bread."}
{"text":"I know they're a new business so I'll return again once or twice one they're more established and update my review if needs be.   I have mixed feelings about my visit...so I'd probably go with 3.5 stars right now.   The pros:  - The round white loaf I purchased was gorgeous. Eaten that night with homemade butternut squash soup I was in heaven. Fresh, soft & yeasty. So the fresh baked bread gets a big thumbs up.... Or at least the round white loaf does.  - The cranberry turkey melt was good. The nine grain bread was delicious & the herb sauce they added definitely adds something.   The cons:  - The round loaves were not labeled (only the sliced bread was labeled). I walked around the bread several times trying to decipher what bread I was looking at before I had to ask for assistance. I'm not sure if that's a normal thing.  - Most products weren't available when I went in. After looking at the website prior to going I was excited to try several things. Most baked goods weren't available and the breads I were interested in not there. I specifically wanted to try the Hello Dolly bar but we're informed they were busy & hadn't been making them.   I will definitely try again, but I think I'll wait until they're a bit more settled in."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Quality food, good prices, excellent customer service. Booths and table seating. You would never know how great this place is from outside. Freshly baked bread, cookies, scones, sweet roles, macaroons, bread pudding, chicken pot pies,and pies....wow! They use quality Board's Head meat in sandwiches too. So good. Met owner, great experience. Pretty far for me to drive. Tried it due to Groupon but worth it."}
{"text":"I stopped by Bread Basket and Pies for the first time this week to grab a bite for lunch. I loved the chicken noodle soup, and I had a dessert/cookie called 'Hello Dolly' that was soooo delicious. Will definitely stop by for lunch again soon! Is so nice to have fresh, homemade food. The Employees were also very kind and helpful."}
{"text":"My mom and sister visited me at work (I work in the same plaza) and we all had lunch together here. The owner, and his female employee were extremely helpful, thoughtful and kind while my family and I enjoyed their lunch. My mother and sister had a chicken sandwich which they loved. I purchased a loaf of jalape√±o/cheese bread which has been awesome! So good! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is such a cute, locally owned bakery. The service is always beyond 5 stars!! I love the turkey sandwich with cranberry/cream cheese spread and every time I go I like to try a different bakery item (sweet roll, amazing brownies, cookies etc!) Plus, the prices are great."}
{"text":"We have gone there many times and their soups are great especially the clam chowder.  We always get something to take home, the last time we got the molasses cookies.  They reminded me of the cookies my grandmother made for me when  I was growing up.   Their sandwiches are very good.    I just wish they would make a Pastrami sandwich, they sure have a good rye bread to make it."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp, close to work, thought it would be worth a try. Very pleased with the food, quality and prices. Love the family owned feel, you can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"The food that I got was completely worth the money and absolutely delicious! I will definitely be going back in the future!"}
{"text":"This local business is AMAZING! As soon as you open the door, you get intoxicated by the most wonder smell of bread. Excellent prices and the owners are super friendly. If you're going to spend $3.50 on a loaf at the store then you might as well come here and buy a homemade loaf for a buck more.Love this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Family owned under new management of the son. Very friendly service and quality food. Had to take a few loaves of bread togo after grabbing the cranberry turkey melt combo for and early lunch. Will definitely be back and am glad I came across the great place :)"}
{"text":"Sweet Christmas! I hit the jackpot for lunch today by finding Bread Basket on Yelp this afternoon. I was in the mood for a sandwich and searched for local eateries near my location, that's how I found Bread Basket. When I walked in the door I was instantly greeted by a very friendly staff. After browsing the menu I decided on the daily special: Ham & Turkey on 9-grain with garlic aioli and Havarti cheese. For $8.50 it came with chips, a drink, an oatmeal cookie, and a pickle spear. I told them it was my first time in and they signed me up for the rewards program. In addition, the kind staff also gave me a free blueberry scone.  I ended up eating the blueberry scone first. I cannot tell you how delicious and soft the scone was. It also had a delightful cream cheese icing on top that totally completed the desert. I ate my sandwich next, which was absolutely wonderful! The bread was buttered and grilled, the sandwich was hot and fresh, and it was an absolute blessing to my taste buds. I will absolutely be back on more lunch breaks in order to taste other delicious items on their menu.  A big thank you to Bread Basket for being so friendly and serving some wonderful food."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at Bread Basket, and I almost feel guilty.  It's a bit like visiting your grandmother's house. The delicious food just doesn't stop coming. Allow me to explain...  You walk in, and - since it's my first time - that somehow entitles me to this delicious cookie/scone thing covered in icing. Welp, goodbye diet. Then, it comes time to order. For $8.50, I ordered today's special (Turkey Ham Club). OK great, except it comes with chips, another cookie (oatmeal raisin, delicious!), and a fountain drink. I subbed the drink for a coffee (which was great just black) and a side salad.  Then, I get asked to sample bread while I'm waiting for my food. Am I still hungry at this point?  Food comes, and it takes nearly the whole table. Phenomenally delicious (and very simple, no frills needed) sandwich stacked high with meat. A salad that takes up the entirety of one of those large plastic to-go boxes. A small cookie to compliment my scone thing. And a bag of Lay's chips.  \"Grandma, stop shoving food in my face!\"  But really... keep feeding me. And for these prices, you will feel a little guilty walking out the door. But hey, that's what the tip jar is for!"}
{"text":"You would be better off getting sweets elsewhere. I've had the following from them (2 different days): cookie, scone, hello dolly and I feel like they don't use high quality ingredients, which they should for the prices they charge. There is a definite lack of real butter. Next time I'll go the extra few miles and visit the cookie shop in downtown Mesa. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience.  The coffee is great and the blueberry scones are AMAZING!  Their macaroons are perfect!  The owners are incredibly sweet and generous.  Definitely a breath of fresh air compared to corporate coffee stops."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time, free scone! Slice of awesome cranberry and orange bread and had a bomb grilled turkey and ham. Owner was the man! Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Not only is the pricing unbeatable, but the smell of freshly baked bread surrounds you while you enjoy the amazing sandwiches they have. I am definitely going to be back! $8.50 for a sandwich, drink, cookie, CHIPS AND A PICKLE?! I was expecting a small sandwich, but NOPE, they fill you up with delicious Boars Head meats and cheeses, I couldn't take another bite of my Turkey Club. I had to take some bread to go, as well as a delicious lemon bar. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Outstanding bakery and cafe. Had delightful convo with owner about his family history in this bakery, their simple ingredients, and coffee. Several folks enjoying late lunch during our visit. Got the fresh spelt bread, big cinnamon roll and a few other things. Very happy to find this spot."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Yummy cookies! The oatmeal is my favorite. I've grown up coming here and recently was in the area and stopped by and I will be coming regularly now! It's very good and the prices are great and it's the best sandwich place in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Totally not impressed.  While the clam chowder was very good, the roll that came with it was gooey and undercooked and if the oatmeal cookie they have me came out of my kitchen, I'd be very embarrassed.  The chicken pot pie was very dry inside and over peppered. All in all not a place I would reccommended."}
{"text":"I need to go again when I'm hungry, but I stopped in to grab some cookies for the first time and got the oatmeal chocolate chip--$2 for two giant cookies and they were so good! I also sampled a piece of their English muffin bread and it was super good. I want to try all the baked goods haha"}
{"text":"Hands down better Very Berry pie than Piefection!!  Just saying... This place has definitely the best pumpernickel bread that I'v ever tasted. Also kudos to the baker for the pumpernickel bread and the VERY BERRY pie. Look forward to coming for soup and sandwiches plus definitely more pie!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I stopped for pastry and coffee. At 7:30am, they were \"just taking the pastries out of the freezer\". The one coffee option was from a pump carafe using a styrofoam cup. Cinnamon roll (microwaved to warm) was okay. This is a church bake sale in a storefront."}
{"text":"Nice people, very clean. We tried 4 different items. All were very bland. Little to no seasoning. Just bla-bla-bla....bla"}
{"text":"I'm sold on this place just based on the cookie, yea it's that good.  The sandwiches are equally as amazingly good,  and it's all home made.  One of my favorite things is that they serve filtered water,  I think thats what makes the food so good. Everything was rich in flavor and very moist. I'm definitely taking home a pie.  Turns out NASA had taken their bread into space, so i guess their food is out of this world.  Literally.  No doubt I'll be back,  excellent for lunch."}
{"text":"First time here. We had fantastic grilled sandwiches. Smells wonderful in here with all the homemade breads and baked goods.  The service is friendly. Definitely a place to return to again and again."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about their chicken soup.  This is truly the taste of heaven as Mrs. Izenberg my neighbor from the local Hadassa would exclaim home about the chicken soup , ...' Mit schmalz even',  she belched uncontrollably..    Prepared fresh each morning, the soup is made with mounds of appropriate veggies for the very health conscious: and home made noodles, yet.  Oh vey, not Kosher but could pass the most stringent rules,...hmm, maybe even latkes one day,  I wish!   I shall add additional photos of the store front, so when you come by four a visit and to pick up a cookie or two, then you'll know you found the right place!  Se you there, my LE friends!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place was just completely ridiculous in terms of service. I wanted to place an order for 14 pies for my wedding and the cashier got excessively nervous at the word \"wedding,\" even though I wasn't asking for anything special, just some pies. He was unable to answer any of my fairly basic questions about their pies, like which pies are your most popular, can you make any of them regardless of season, etc. He had me talk to his girlfriend who didn't even work at the bakery and also couldn't answer any of my questions. (I think the thought process was that wedding = woman stuff?) He did give me a delicious slice of pie, though, and leave a note for his father, the owner. A few days later, I received a call from the father, who was just as baffled about everything as the son. The owner left me a voicemail saying, \"I have a note...something about pies? ...and...wedding?!\" He was sort of able to answer some of my questions, but also told me that they don't usually do orders ahead of time, unless someone calls a day early because they want to bring a pie to work the next morning. At this point, I decided that as delicious as the pie was, I couldn't trust this place to turn out the correct number of pies on the correct date for me. Ultimately, I went to Pies-n-More - not as delicious, but at least they can handle getting an order in advance."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a good place to have a soup and sandwich, and we found it at the Bread Basket on University. We both ordered a ham and cheese sandwich, and I ordered their clam chowder. The meals were served with a bag of chips, a pickle and and a peanut butter cookie. There was fresh bread all over the place, and it smelled yummy. I would recommend this place for a meal or just to buy some delicious bakery items."}
{"text":"Meh. I thought by the reviews that this would be better than we experienced. It was ok - chicken pot pies were room temperature, salads were preassembled nothing special. Sandwiches were basic. Not bad, but not worth going back.   Please note - the baked goods looked great, but I didn't sample any."}
{"text":"I was driving by looking for a spot to eat with my son that wasn't crazy busy or a fast food place. I spotted this little place tucked in the corner and decided to give it a shot. Definitely glad I stopped. They offer a variety of grilled sandwiches, salads and soups in addition to their baked goods. I went with a small loaf of banana nut bread and the ham and Swiss sandwich to split with my son. The sandwiches come with a drink, chips, cookie and pickle spear. The portions are great sized for a light lunch without being overwhelming. The Ham and Swiss sandwich comes on their nine grain whole wheat bread and is like heaven on toast. Seriously so delicious! I wish I had ordered more than just one to split, it was that good. The prices are very reasonable for freshly baked items. The staff is friendly and helpful. I will absolutely be coming here again."}
