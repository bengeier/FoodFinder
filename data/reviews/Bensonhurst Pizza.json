{"text":"I'm really, really torn on Bensonhurst. On one hand, I genuinely like most everything I have tried here, & continue to go back for this reason. On the other hand, the service issues have been quite substantial in at least half of my visits, to the point where you can no longer just blame bad luck or growing pains. 

The pizza is usually quite good. Providing a choice of styles - currently NY, thin crust & deep dish - is a great idea! Haven't tried the deep dish, but the other 2 types are well executed. The NY style has a decently flavourful sauce. I've also enjoyed the very yummy gnocchi mac & cheese, & my dining partners have raved about the meatball sub. There are numerous TVs so sporting events are usually playing. You can sit & have a drink at the short bar if you want, although the last time I was in they no longer carried Brooklyn IPA which was my go-to beer at Bensonhurst. 

Service varies from acceptable to atrocious, with only 1 instance of awesome (when I sat at the bar & received impeccable attention from a bartender who, sadly, no longer works there). The worst evening was a busy night when almost all of our table's order was delivered to other guests who arrived after us, leaving our food to trickle out over half an hour, not including the initial half hour wait. Two people had meatball subs, but the first was long finished by the time the second sub arrived. The real problem was that no one would tell us what was happening. We had to complain before a manager came over & apologized that another server had screwed up. We were given a small discount & a $20 coupon for a future visit, but since our out-of-town guests were paying that night, they kinda got shafted - the coupon was no use to them.

Another time it took us half an hour to pay because a large table asked for their bills right before us, & our server left the payment terminal at their table for 5 minutes at a time while she disappeared into the back. If she had stayed to reset the terminal as soon as each person paid, she could have cashed their whole table out in 5 mins. Instead, it took half an hour, & she wasn't spending that time taking other orders or delivering food. Everyone was quite frustrated.

This should be a 3 1/2 star review, but I will leave it as 4 instead of 3 because I can get a great vegetarian pizza here, & that isn't something I can say at a lot of places in Calgary. I wish they would bring back the Brooklyn IPA, though!

(I can't remember if the washrooms are accessible, but there is a proper ramp in front & some tables are a regular height, with room to wheel up a chair)"}
{"text":"Let's compare authentic styles of pizza from around the world and let's do it while we people watch on 17th Avenue SW.  Calgarian and President of Bensonhurst Pizza Brian Printz has brought to Calgary authentic New York, Sicilian, Chicago, Californian, and Neapolitan Style pizza.
On the day after opening we ordered the Bensonhurst Classic.  It's an 18 inch New York style with tomato sauce, mozzarella, ricotta cheese, pepperoni, sausage, garlic, and oregano.  The HUGE pizza came with a crispy, chewy crust and a delicious sauce and sausage.  Oil from the fresh cheese formed golden pools of juicy richness on the top of the pie.
If you are unfamiliar with some of the styles your placemat will provide you with information on all the variations of pizza offered.  Ours even provided us with New York eating etiquette.  Fold your pizza slice lengthwise before shoving it in your pie hole.
Prices for a pie will run you between $16 and $26 and there are several flavours of each style of pizza to choose from.  If you come at lunch bring friends or be prepared to take some pizza home with you.  No luncheon sizes are available.
Their website says \"opening soon\" but, make no mistake, they are open now."}
{"text":"1. Restaurant looked great from the outside, so why not give it try. I love pizzas anyway
2. Ordered drinks and pizza
3. Mojito tasted like water
4. Pizza: Nothing special
5. Service: Bad

Not the best place to go to. Not worth what you paid for.

Thanks bye!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place, because Calgary needs more variety in pizza styles. Unfortunately, though, their NYC style doesn't taste like NY pizza.

We ordered the New York Street Pizza ($22), a big 18\" pie, and added pepperoni for $1. The sauce was perfect, the cheese was good, but the crust wasn't quite right. The edge was thick and bready, and the bottom was nearly crisp. The slices were foldable, but didn't have that chewy quality. The most disappointing part, though, was the pepperoni. Not dry cured, but that bologna-like pink stuff. To top it off, I paid $8.50 for a bottle of Strongbow that turned out to be 350 mL.

Apparently this place has two ovens, so their Chicago style might be good. I'd go back and try that, but stick with water to drink."}
{"text":"Will not be returning  -Gave this place a second go after the first time we visited. 
The food was pretty good  but the waitresses have no interest at all in serving.
Simple requests were ignored eg water, no anchovy on a ceaser, chili flakes for the pizza. It  was understandable it was a Friday evening and was busy.
Saying this the waitresses let a few tables around us wait for 20 mins before approaching them and a couple of girls sitting by us got up and left? 
Is this not the first thing a manager drills into servers that customers are key?? Letting people walk out is terrible. They all see to be inexperienced.
Second visit was a disaster - Sunday lunch time and all of the servers including the USELESS manager that was there walking around the restaurant like headless chickens. 
My friend asked for water 3 times, my pizza came out after 40 mins after my friend had got his food right away. 
No apologies from waitress either - I don't mind waiting if I am told. 
The chef was placing food up and the servers and manager walked past numerous times leaving good food go bad. I heard the chef ask the manager to bring a steak dish to a table -she brought it and the guest said it was cold. The manager brought it back to the chef and asked to put it on the grill to heat it up. The chef said (obviously to anyone with any knowledge of food) that it would over cook the steak and it should have been brought up when it was hot. Ridiculous. The manager was a tall female with blonde hair and doesn't have a clue about managing a restaurant.
The whole experience was just a joke. We wanted to get out of there. 
With all the delicious pizza places along 17th -Cibo and Una in particular with their great service and vibe I can see this place closing its doors soon!"}
{"text":"Second visit last night.  Busy...always busy.  We walk by almost daily.  Things were confused and our order, no fault of our lovely and courteous server, was messed up from start to finish.  Our orders arrived in parts as sides were forgotten etc.  One of our desserts was credited and apologies were offered.  This was because 10 minutes after this dessert was ordered, we were informed that they had run out.  We hope the management rectifies whatever was going on in the kitchen because this is not the experience we would like to have again for the price we paid.  Thankfully we were in good company and the atmosphere is nice.  We may try again in a couple of months and see if things are back in order."}
{"text":"I had just left the Talisman Centre after pumping a shitload of iron, and stumbled across Bensonhurst. I thought to myself, \"This looks like a great place to ruin my workout\", so I sauntered in with a confident swagger and parked my ass at the bar. The barkeep told me about the nightly special, which was any forno pizza and a pint for $15 (this was a Monday night). Since I was going to order a pint of ice-cold brewskarino anyway, I figured I'd have to be a ritard (yes, I spelled that Allan-from-The-Hangover style) to pass up an offer like that! 

I perused the menu while I enjoyed a frosty glass of Brooklyn IPA, which the barkeep had recommended...good call! It was a light amber colour, tasted slightly but pleasantly bitter and went down easy (like your sister...hey-oh!)

I settled on the Cali Smoke Show, which is topped with double-smoked pancetta, provolone, mozzarella, rosemary, and finished with a drizzle of olive oil. The verdict?:

OH!

EM!

EFF!

GEE!


This was the tastiest 'za that I've EVER had the pleasure of experiencing! Each and every bite was like my mouth was spontaneously having multiple, quivering orgasms. Mouthgasms? Yeah, I'll call them mouthgasms. 

I had planned to eat a couple slices and pack the rest up, but it was so delicious that I stuffed the entire goddamn pie into my filthy tit-licker. Most people use manners when they eat in public, but I didn't give a fuck...I tore into it like a starving dog would tear into a bag of garbage. I'm pretty sure I even let loose a few gleeful grunts; again, zero fucks were given. I haven't been that happy since I received my fourth blowjob! (The first three were kinda shitty).

I ordered another pint and slurped it down, as I had clearly lost any sense of dignity at this point. I chatted with the friendly barkeep, Brian, who also happens to be the owner of the joint. He's a really nice guy and seems to have an acute sense of business acumen. Also, he mentioned that they are adding some new items to the menu really soon, including some healthy choices (salads and such).

Bottom line, this place is epically awesome. Bring your next blind date here; if she's hot, she'll be impressed, and if she's fat, then at least you can enjoy a consolation mouthgasm!"}
{"text":"Growing up in NJ between NYC and Philly, I know a good pizza. I thought the best pizza in Calgary was at Bensonhurst Pizza, but the pie I was served tonight makes me wonder if I was hasty in my proclamation. The preparer commented to the two trainees at his side \"this pizza is over done\" and then proceeded to have the pizza delivered to our table. NO self respecting pizza place would send a burnt pie to its customer. So I am rethinking my designation of Bensonhurst as the best pie in Calgary. A damn shame!"}
{"text":"Favourite pizza in town. Their Chicago style pizza are phenomenal. All the other New York and Forno pizzas are fantastic. Great beer selection, fantastic long islands, and by far the most incredible ice cream sandwich in the world."}
{"text":"We always pass Bensonhurst along 17th avenue and it has a unique, modern look.  I have wanted to check it out for a while now.  My g/f read reviews prior to heading to the restaurant, and was hesitant to try it, but we thought \"what the hell\".  First mistake.  The environment is intact great.  Lots of TV's, paraphernalia all over the walls, fun facts on the menu - this is where the complimentary part of the review ends.  

The server was kind, but slow.  She would disappear for 10-15 minutes at a time always when we were either waiting to give our order, waiting to receive our drinks, or meals, etc.  The servers and (maybe) manager were constantly involved with each other - talking more in groups then tending to the customers, which became increasingly frustrating.

My beer was flat, my g/f ordered the raspberry ale which was good and the bruschetta was late to the table but delicious.  We ordered the Chicago style pizza to share - now I wouldn't consider myself a connoisseur of fine Chicago pizza, but I have been to the city a few times and always had a pie when I was there.  I know enough to be confident the dough should be cooked and there shouldn't be half an inch of grease sitting in the pan.

At this point we were about done with the experience.  We asked for the check - our server apologized for being in the back \"talking to herself\" as she described it?  Asked us to hopefully try Bensonhurst again as this isn't what we should expect. I think thats why they call them first impressions - needless to say, we won't be going back.  I was most disappointed that the manager didn't come out to speak with us to try to understand what happened and how he could make it right. That's why you're in the service industry correct?  Anyways - thumbs down."}
{"text":"Decent idea, but horrible execution and staff. I love the idea of having different styles of pizzas, and the sandwiches are decent as well, but I should have ended it at my first visit. 

The first time was about a week or so after its opening, so there may have been a bit of stuff to finesse. When we walked in, there was no greeting, and we weren't sure whether we were to seat ourselves or wait. This took about five minutes until a server just told us to sit wherever we liked. She was also slow in attending to us despite it being pretty empty. So service was definitely subpar. Food wise, the meatball sub was fantastic and I would order it again, but the pasta with the clams (forget the name) was definitely undercooked and the clams weren't even washed out! I was spitting out sand every bite or so. 

Second time - I was craving a quick sandwich for lunch and against my better judgement went back to Bensonhurst with my date. The service had gotten impossibly bad. After getting seated we waited 15 minutes for our server to even approach us and say hi, and then another 15 for water and menus. We were one of two tables in the restaurants and there was literally nothing she was doing. After that, we waited even longer for her to come back and take our orders to the point that we nearly wanted to walk out and head elsewhere. I can't believe how bad the service is here. It's hardly worth the tip we provided. 

The food was alright. We ordered a steak sandwich (literally, a steak on a piece of bread...weird to me) which was okay but left a lot to the imagination. I ordered the Foccacini, with a lot more fixings than the steak, as well as a side of fries which made for a decent deal. 

Overall, I'd likely not go back to them until they hire a new set of waitresses hat actually know how to serve and check in on their customers. Maybe I'd try takeout or delivery options to avoid it. (Side note, my boyfriend ordered pizzas from them for a work lunch and they said they'd bring it to them across the street in about 15 minutes. 45 minutes later, they called and told them they couldn't make it and for them to pick it up. C'mon Bensonhurst.)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service on a consistent basis. The beer and wine lists are great.

Try the Bensonhurst Classic pizza, it tastes even better the next day!"}
{"text":"First visit to Bensonhurst Pizza was a double thumbs UP 
Our group of 4 ordered 4 different pizzas to \"test drive\" this newcomer to 17th Ave.
All 4 were terrific, but my Bensonhurst Classic....was OFF THE CHARTS .......and this pie is enough for 3-4 people.
Noise level was high as you would expect and the service was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  THANK YOU ASHLEY.
Bensonhurst is number 1 for pizza in Calgary."}
{"text":"My sister, brother-in-law and I went to this place after wandering around the street on a Saturday looking for a not seriously packed spot to eat.

We settled on Bensonhurst.

At first blush, this New York meets Chicago via Italy pizza place with the German Beer Haus sounding name should be confusing, but it seems to work. The restaurant is well laid out with cool graffiti, Chicago warehouse windows, subway tile, an open kitchen and clay pizza oven. Bensonhurst seems to be able to make gritty welcoming.

As for food, the menu does an E for Effort job of organizing, and explaining, New York, Chicago and Neapolitan pizza styles. The pizzas we ordered had decent flavour, but the chefs need a bit of schooling on the difference between spinach and arugula and why it's a good idea to not use canned black olives. 

Bensonhurst gets points for originality and spunk but upping their food game, perhaps with better quality ingredients to help perfect each pizza style on offer, would take this concept restaurant with the cool atmosphere up a level.

Overall, as the only pizza joint offering Chicago and New York style in the city that isn't fast food, I'd go again for lunch and do recommend you try it out too;  a solid three.

{"text":"Let me pre empt this by saying I was not even remotely hungry when I went to Bensonhurst with my family for a birthday dinner. There were 3 adults and one adorable little girl. We ordered the Antipasto for Two, Deconstructed Bruschetta, and the Cali Smoke Show Pizza. Everything was presented beautifully and came out quickly. The flavours and quality! Again I was not hungry after already having birthday breakfast and lunch. Even in my state of being full term with a food baby, I did more than my share of damage to the plates in front of us. The lemon avocado oil on the pizza *drool*. After we completely annihilated anything edible at our table, our sever mentioned dessert, I was ready to tap out and beg for mercy, buuuuut I asked what her favourite was. Before I could even finish asking, she blurted out cheesecake. Working in the industry myself, I know that if a server jumps on something that quickly then you best order it...... We did (my poor belly). The cheesecake didn't stand a chance. NY Cheesecake meets cannoli, need I say more. 
I started this review at a 4, but changed it to 5 for two reasons, 1. I was stuffed when I got there and still are everything. 2. Pizza is not a go to for me at all and this pie being full of ingredients that I usually avoid, blew my mind. 
My work here is done, I'm off to buy elastic waisted pants."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday afternoon! Food was lovely once it arrived! Service was the worst I have ever experienced, I finished my food before my friends mains came out! Waiting staff let food go cold by constantly walking past the prepared food! The chef even looked annoyed at this and brought food down to a table at one stage! Our waitress wasn't apologetic after a 40 minute wait for pizza, I finally got a glass of water the third time I asked! I would hate to see the service on a busy day! Such a pity place has such potential, with good food and nice decor! but we will not be going back due to the lack of professionalism and courtesy! I have never complained a out service before, but couldn't not on this occasion!"}
{"text":"Well I read a few great reviews on this place and I have walked past a few times and its been busy so I decided to give it a try. Bad call. 

The restaurant itself is nice. It is actually really nice. I like that. But thats about where it ended. 

I ordered the Hawaii 5 Ono. But the waitress told me it was really big and suggested something else. 

When my food came it was a thin crust soggy mess of a pizza. It tasted fine but was not what I was craving. I was more disappointed to see that I was charged extra for adding meat and pineapple to this disgusting soggy thing they called pizza. 

The server was less than friendly. Half way through eating a server came up and asked if I wanted my pizza packed up. I was unaware that drinking my beverage was a sign that I had finished eating. 

Honestly, It wasn't great food and the severs were not great. I'd skip it."}
{"text":"Hidden gem on 17th ave.

They must have corrected the earlier issues, because the service has been fantastic every time we've come in, the food is awesome.

My fave pizza is the Meat lovers district, the gnocchi mac & cheese is excellent.

Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! 

The pizza is really really nice. I've been here several times and will definitely come back.They have is the best thin crust, Italian pizza in the city, cooked in a wood fired oven and all the ingredients are top-quality. \"Fresco\" is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Bensonhurst fan. While I've got several nearby \"regular\" places, such as Tubby Dog and Nellie's, I can happily add this place to my list. 

The pizza is fantastic here. They have several styles available, and the ingredients the restaurant uses are tasty and high-quality. My favourite is a Chi Town Classic with double pepperoni: a deep-dish pizza with tons of cheese and sauce that must be eaten with a fork and knife. 

The drink selection is pretty decent too, although pricey unless you get a special. The fishbowl-sized Long Island Iced Teas are well worth it though. 

If you go, be prepared for a bit of a wait of it's busy. It's not a huge restaurant, but classic pizzas can take a while to make (Chicago-style takes up to 45 minutes, you'll get quoted). 

We took a group of 15 there on a Friday night with a reservation of about 4 days notice, and the service was a bit slow - there was quite a wait for both drinks and pizzas. The quality of both the food and the service was a bit below the average for the restaurant. When the manager noticed our party was a smaller than reserved (some of our guests were running late ), he also asked if he could take the extra space for other guests - take that for what you will. 

Overall, Bensonhurst is a great restaurant with excellent food. I'd recommend hitting it for lunch or during the week for the best experience. Five stars, despite the less-than-stellar party experience."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Our server Landon was very friendly and quite a character (in a good way), nice beer selection, good Caesars, and food was ready in a timely manner. It's a bit on the pricey side but portions are huge. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza and experience. For being so quiet I was surprised that our server was so lax. But the pizza and the meatball sandwich were solid. The pizza I picked was chicken Brie and cranberry sauce. How can that go wrong? A little spendy but welcome to Calgary. $50 lunch with no beverages."}
{"text":"Our first experience  was quite pleasant, our server was super friendly and nice... and we didn't notice that the pizzas are HUGE (!), so we ended up with Pizza for breakfast the day after!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good pizza spot. really good daily specials and the best mac and cheese gnocchi I've ever had (still have dreams about it) good place for drinks after work. Was here for NYE 2014 and had a great time. love all the different varieties of pizza, can't go wrong with any choice."}
{"text":"my friends and I went there on Father's Day to watch  a soccer game ( WWC, won) . we were lucky , we got a table although we did not make reservation. The service was really good. Food was just okay, the deep dish pizza was a bit disappointing, but I really enjoy seeing them to do pizza making! Fun!"}
{"text":"It's safe to say I've found a new go-to place in Bensonhurst Pizza.  Our hostess sat us in a nice quiet place, knowing full well we wanted to have a quiet dinner.  Our server, Landon was amazing, friendly, fun and quirky.   He was quick to help us and offered us some really good suggestions, it being our first time.

They have 3 styles of pizza which is pretty unique as it's a one-stop-shop for different types of pizzas.  We had the New York style pizza and the thin crust (not too thin) was amazing.  It was flavorful without being too greasy.

The Chicago deep dish pizza looked promising and we'll go back to try that again.

---Update---2015-03-31----

Since my first visit we've been back a few times.  The first time I tried the Chicago-style pizza I was quite impressed.  The last time I went the crust was way overdone and too hard.  I'm willing to give it another go but would have to mention to them not to overcook the Chicago-style pizza crust."}
{"text":"We arrived late to a birthday dinner, the waitress commented on our lateness (in a joking way). We were only there for drinks so it wasn't a big deal. Wine is a bit pricey, but still good. They have a pretty good beer list, and from what I hear the food is excellent. 

Now for the bad. 
\"I'll bring you the bill and you can figure it out\" was sadly what the waitress said to Us when the bill was mentioned. When it comes to groups. It's a good idea to say \"hey, just so you know, I can't split the bill\" at the beginning of the service. Not (with attitude) at the end. 

I get it, this is a new place, they are working out the kinks, and getting their groove. I'll still come back and take another shot. First appearances aren't always the best, and most places will impress with a second chance!"}
{"text":"Ordered an 18\" pepperoni after having a piece at a wine tasting and was told it would be 20 minutes for take out. After 35 minutes, I asked how much longer and was informed that they were experiencing issues with their oven. In the time waiting, I saw a large number of good \"cooked\" pizza being delivered to tables and a scavenger hunt coming into the business. I waited another five minutes to be handed an undercooked, soupy pizza with the cheese already slopped off the pizza onto the box. I asked for a refund and left without a pizza after waiting 40 minutes. The manager did not even apologize even though he was the one to give me the soupy pizza. I will not return to Bensonhurst Pizza."}
