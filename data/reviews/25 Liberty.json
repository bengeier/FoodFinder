{"text":"This is one of the most under appreciated restaurants in the city.  With amazing food and a great setting, you would expect that it would be packed. Unfortunately, the restaurant was empty with more staff hanging out than diners enjoying a meal. Normally, I am a fan of high ceilings but in this instance they made the room feel even more empty. 25 Liberty only filled up after the soccer game was over, turning  into a pub atmosphere very quickly.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a meal...just try and avoid game days, or make sure you will be finished your meal before the match is over."}
{"text":"We had good food and the service was excellent.  More people need to know about this place! It is a gem in the Liberty area."}
{"text":"We were looking for a spot to have a drink before a TFC game and decided to go to the Liberty Bistro and we found 25 Liberty. I had no idea that it had been renovated. I've been going to the Liberty Bistro and always liked it. I was a bit sad that it was gone. 

25 Liberty has taken the bohemian out of the place and have made it more posh. We had drinks and didn't snub us for not ordering food which was good. The Whisky Sour that was ordered came in the correct glass which I thought was a nice touch. 

I will go back for dinner the next time that I'm in Liberty Village to check out the menu. 

**If you are going for a drink after work, check out this place if you are looking for a change from the Brazen Head**"}
{"text":"FIRST, I just have to say: Really, previous reviewer? Three stars based on a single drink that you, in fact, seemed to enjoy? Did you knock two stars off simply because the restaurant it used to be is gone? Harsh.

We were planning to go to (too cool for) School for brunch, but the line was insane, so we moseyed over to 25 Liberty. SO GLAD we did. The space looks a bit fancy pants for my taste, but lovely nonetheless. Really nice bathrooms. (I hate it when restaurants skimp on/don't clean their washrooms.) The prices are on par with anything else in Liberty Village, and pretty much the same as at School.

Here's the skinny:
Coffee: very good and waaaay better than School (Sorry to keep dissing School, but I also hate when brunch places have bad coffee. Make an effort, people!)
Eggs with caramelized onions, garlicky spinach and Brie: so delicious; creamy, garlicky, fluffy...pretty much perfect
Herbed potatoes: Fingerlings! No boring russet chunks here. Herby and not overly salty.
Salad: I am usually underwhelmed by salad with my breakfast at anyplace that isn't French, but this was fantastic. A mix of interesting greens and tasty dressing.
Toasts: Unexpectedly, the egg dishes came with grilled, herbed toasts. Extra delicious.
Double-smoked bacon: As good as it sounds. Thick and not fatty or greasy.
Beef, ham and Sriracha sausage: my husband loved it -- a bit TOO meaty and salty for me, but that's why I didn't order it and he did

Zero pretension, super friendly staff, huge light-filled space, with no crowds and no wait. Can't wait to go back and try more.

**UPDATE: Removed a star. Went here again last weekend and it wasn't quite as impressive. The salad was a boring romaine lettuce instead of mixed field greens. Portions were smaller.  Fruit salad was much smaller and less variety. Gravlax was bland and potato rosti was tiny. Cutting back on quality?"}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday around 1:45pm. We were a group of 5 and were completely ignored while standing in line for 15 minutes. There were empty tables but two groups ahead of us were still waiting to be seated. I can appreciate that they were maybe understaffed that day (although one staff member was just drying glasses at the bar while we stood there), but to completely ignore a group of people waiting for a table is pretty terrible. After 15 minutes without even being acknowledged, we left. I'm only giving one star because I can't give zero."}
{"text":"An overall disappointing experience. Good food horrible service. Our waitress seemed more interested in flirting with another waiter then actually getting our cup of tea. 30 minutes waiting for those drinks!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are on a search for the some of the best places to eat in Liberty Village and 25 Liberty is absolutely at the top of that list.  First of of all the staff was very friendly (greeting us when we arrived and thanking us when we left) and they were attentive but not overtly so.  The atmosphere is really great, you can tell that a lot of thought was put into the design and ambiance of the restaurant, an open but also private atmosphere.  And finally the food was fantastic.  I had the Duck Breast and because I am a celiac they were willing to swap in some polenta and vegetables for the gluten options.  Overall 25 Liberty is going on the list of must eat places."}
{"text":"I made a last minute decision to hit up 25 Liberty and I'm so glad I did!  It's high end food without the high prices, the drinks were made well.  

We opted to skip starters and instead just had a cocktail, a nice and simple gin and tonic.  The tonic water is homemade and delicious, I was even able to talk to the person who made the batch we were drinking and I managed to get some information about the tonic, which of course I'm not going to reveal, but rest assured, it was worth it!

We had two mains, the sea bass & prawns (the prawns were enormous), and the duo of lamb.  I'm a huge fan of all the ingredients and the lamb was fall off the bone tender and the sauce was complimentary in every way possible.

We're glad we opted to skip a starter and instead saved room for dessert.  The toffee chocolate cake with raspberry sorbet was amazing! The other dessert was a date pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that was probably the creamiest ice cream I've ever tasted.

All in all our experience was amazing and I will definitely go back again for seconds!"}
{"text":"Food was alright, but was asked if we wanted bread, like who doesn't!? It also almost took an hour for the food to come, which was odd.. Considering that it didn't seem that busy."}
{"text":"I work and live in Liberty Village. I eat at all the restaurants, atleast once. This place is life changing. I had lunch here the other day ... it used to be another restaurant, but since the renovation it is at the top of my list for places to eat or hang in this neighbourhood. The staff is friendly and helpful..very attentive. The food is THE BOMB!!!!!! I had a duck sandwich with salad and wine. The sauces, the bread, the presentation --- it was well worth it. I really hope people with a brain in their heads go to support this place cause I would hate for it to disappear. That location has always been a challenge in this area, even though it is RIGHT ON THE CORNER of a main street. Super convenient, cozy, and a great spot. LOVE IT."}
{"text":"I think the reviewer who called the previous establishment 'bohemian' meant  to say filthy. The restaurant that previously occupied this space served one single function, patio beers. The one time I stepped foot inside, I was grossed out and I would not dare order the food, inside or out. Good riddance! 

25 Liberty is a welcomed improvement. The food is decent, the interior is lovely, and the service is attentive and efficient. What impressed me the most was the cocktail list, not many places nearby to get a good cocktail, except for Origin. Mildred's can sometimes pull through, but all they really have going for them is their pricing. 

HOWEVER, make sure the bartender is there before getting too excited.. without him all they can muster up are caesars, mimosas, beer/ wine. Which could enrage a lot of brunch-goers, like myself. 

Their dinner menu looks promising as does their wine list. But, as far as brunch goes, 25 Liberty is a welcomed addition to a neighborhood that's otherwise lacking in (good) dining options."}
{"text":"Great brunch!  Nice ambiance and friendly staff. Originally we planned on going to School for Sunday brunch but the wait was over an hour. 25 welcomed us right in and the food was beyond expectations; will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I came here for Saturday brunch. Service was good. Ambience is nice. Food and value leaves a lot to be desired.

I ordered the \"steak and eggs\", based on the server's recommendation. The plate was nicely presented, but unfortunately it was not tasty. The braised beef short ribs was \"melt in your mouth\", but lacked flavor. The bernaise sauce was unable to save the dish.

For dessert I ordered a creme caramel. It was average and not worth the $9 they charged for it.

At the prices they charge, there are much better options available."}
{"text":"The food was great even though the owner didn't know what was in some of the dishes. I had to ask about the soup of the day, and other things rather then being told. For a \"fine dinning\" place it wasn't up to par. Even though the food was good I think this place was too expensive for what you get. 
Great for a first visit but not likely to go back."}
{"text":"25 Liberty is hands down the best restaurant in the underserved Liberty Village neighbourhood. We've been for dinner three times and brunch once and have enjoyed every meal.

While the restaurant is consistently busier for brunch, we found dinner to be far more enjoyable. The service has always been top notch, they have a good selection of wines and the specials are delicious and unexpected (Fresh anchovies flown in from the Italian coast? Yes please!). 

The mains tend to be slightly overpriced, considering the restaurant has been half empty every time we've been. But the portions are filling, the dishes are well executed and we always leave feeling satisfied. Dessert is often served with a complimentary glass of dessert wine. 

This one is worth the trip to Liberty Village. 

Best dishes:
- Gnocchi
- Beef cheek
- Braised shortribs"}
{"text":"This place was great. Great atmosphere, great server, awesome food (I had the grilled cheese). But the prices are insane! I'd be here all the time if it were about 2/3 the price."}
{"text":"Live in the area so stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  Everything my husband and I had was very good.  My husband had the grilled cheese and I had the duck sandwich. Yes -- prices are a bit high, but serving sizes are generous. 

Lunch sandwiches come with a great salad and potato rosti (like a hash) or daily soup.  We tried both sides and liked them both.

Looking forward to stopping in for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"I the food there is good but it's too pricey. With 30 bucks, you have a large range if places too go, ever better than 25 liberty. If you want try their brunch be aware that you going to spend more than 40 minutes to get your food."}
{"text":"This was sort of a walk in situation as the popular spot nearby had an extended wait time. The place was half full with most of the people opting to sit out. 
The interior has a nice open feel with a high ceiling and over sized chair and tables for some seating. 
The menu is decent for a brunch and it sorta hits all major food groups. The drink list is decent with a good selection beer (kudos for having an off beat selection for draft) 
I ordered a French Toast and my dinning companion had frittata (vegetarian version).
I ordered the drink of champions ;) as the coffee was not good. 
The service was decent I guess as the server was quite busy.
The food arrived shortly and looked visually appealing. 
The sides for frittata were decent with the main course being OK (portion on the smaller side)
The french toast was quite good and I would recommend if you have a sweet tooth but prefer not overly sweet items, nice creamy custard stuffing and nice topping of almonds and maple syrup.
A decent spot to have a brunch in this area. 
3.5 Stars.
I will be back just to try some other beers they have on tap."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch with my neighbours and the restaurant was buzzing.

Sunlight streams in from the large windows, giving the restaurant an inviting ambiance. I also love that the chairs were super comfy. 

I was not all that impressed with my lemon ricotta french toast, which was accompanied with cream. For $16, I think it was a little expensive, considering it didn't come with a side (no bacon or home fries.) The portion was small, as well. On the other hand, all three ladies at the table ordered the frittata, which came with sweet potato fries and bread. They seemed to like it, but none of them raved about it. I did enjoy the lavender lemonade that I ordered, as it was very refreshing. 

Our server had a very pleasant disposition and the service we received was good. I might give this place another try."}
{"text":"Came here after a TFC game for drinks and was impressed with the atmosphere. There were some interesting beers on the menu (local one right from Liberty Village, belgian beers, etc). and the prices were not exorbitant at all. I didn't have anything to eat this time but saw some appetizing things go out around us so would definitely come back for lunch or dinner some day."}
{"text":"We actually went to School first and there was about a 30 minute wait.  But lucky for us, this resulted in our great experience at 25 Liberty!
No waiting.  Our group of 5 were seated right away.  
Super big and comfy chairs.  Great decor.  I am a fan of seeing local artist's artwork up on the walls.
This place is a tad on the pricier side for a breakfast ($14-19 approx), but if you are looking for FLAVOUR, this is definitely worth the cost!  I'm not sure if any other place could top the Eggs Benny that I had here!  Yum!
They even sent us a small plate of fruit to start us off while we waited which was a great added tough.
The service we had was great.  Our waiter gave us the entire low down on the menu explaining almost every dish.  It was actually difficult to choose a meal since all of the items on the menu sounded incredible.  The other waiters also help each other out so when our food came out, it came out all at once as other servers were there to deliver all the plates.  Our actually waiter didn't deliver any of the plates but was there to see if we had everything that we needed!  Our coffees/water were always topped up.  I honestly couldn't had asked for better service.  Plus they were all quite funny!
The portion size was great!  I actually couldn't finish it all, however I did try my best as the food was great!
The only thing that I could say that is a slight con, was that it smelled a bit in the stair well when you go down the stairs to the bathrooms.  The bathrooms themselves were fine and clean.  Individual bathrooms (coed).
I will definitely be back sometime to check out the dinner menu!"}

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"The food here is good. The service is terrible. Been here twice, and both times had extremely awkward interactions with staff. 

The worst one had to be when our waiter came over and told my wife and I he was \"banning\" us from using our cell phones at the table because he thinks technology is, basically, the devil, it's ruining our society, and making everyone dumb.

We'll never go back. It's a shame - the food is quite good. If they trained their wait staff better, it would be a great place."}
{"text":"Had a Liberty Mule drink, Lentil soup and the basic salad.
Drink was refreshing, soup very beefy but good and salad dressing was fantastic but too little for the price serving only greens/lettuce.
Good place but 3 stars seems fair."}
{"text":"Came here out of necessity when all other brunch places in the village were closed for a holiday.
THIS PLACE IS THE BEST!

Give me that pork belly boy.  Give it to me with those tasty eggs and mountain of melty cheese on a pork sandwich. 

This was the tastiest brunch and food I've had in a looong time. I bring everyone I know here to try the brunch and they can't stop talking about it.

You don't feel heavy and gross after, great fresh juices, hot bartenders. DO IT UP LADIES. You got yourself a legit Ladies of Leisure Sunday with this place."}
{"text":"We did dinner last night and it was awesome. Went on a travelzoo voucher.. The service was excellent. (A very bubbly, energetic gal) we shared the diver scallops. They were outstanding. I had the steak and Wendy had the halibut. We def will go back. The prices are high... However for food of this quality you expect as much."}
{"text":"So I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars and here is why...

The food was delicious but there is most certainly room for improvement. Here is what my table of 3 ordered for dinner on a Saturday night:

Bellini
-highly recommend that you try one of these! It is a more traditional version (not your cheesy frozen cocktail served in a fishbowl sized glass like you get at your local big chain restaurant). It was elegant, refreshing and tasty but at $15 each, you may want to pace yourself.

Charcuterie 
-this was good but it could have been better as all the vegetable accompaniments were pickled (beans, beets onions)...it just needed a bit of variety and maybe a spread of mustard and/or compote to go with the meat and cheese
-buffalo meat was part of the selection and although I appreciated the unique offering, it really did not have much flavour.

Bread Service
-I mention this because if you would want bread at the table it is $2.50 per person which I totally disagree with. Serving bread to your customers, is a cost of doing business and charging for it doesn't really start the meal on a positive note especially when menu prices are already on the higher end...it feels like the restaurant is nickle and dimming their guests
-bread service comes with olives and flavoured butter. It was tasty but the butter came out almost frozen so it really didn't spread well on the fresh bread

Mixed Green Salad
-my friend said it was fresh and crisp and nice light way to start the meal

Venison with Gnocchi 
-tasted great...gnocchi was some of the best I have had

Cornish Hen
-delicious and creatively prepared and presented (I think it came two ways)

Duck Breast
-it was the best plate at the table (it was my order)! It was fabulous and I would go back just for this plate

Grapefruit Cheesecake
-my two friends really liked it. It wasn't so much to my taste as it wasn't as \"fruity\" as I had hoped but the ice cream it came with was flat out amazing

The portion sizes were what one would expect from a higher end dining room. Not too large but not itty-bitty. The presentation of each plate was lovely and thoughtful ...sorry I did not include pictures.

The meal ended with the server bringing out 3 chocolate truffles which I thought was a lovely touch. However, like the butter, they were almost frozen which I am sure is not how they are meant to be served. They also did not have much flavour or richness that I expected. They were a bit bland. 

The service for the most part was good although I should mention there were only 3 other tables (all deuces) in the restaurant. It did irk me slightly that our water glasses went near empty three times and had to ask for top ups.

I think with a some finesse and improving on a few small things, 25 Liberty can really make a mark in the Toronto food scene."}
{"text":"Came here on a travelzoo voucher. We've booked a table here on 2 previous occasions but were never able to make it all the way to liberty village due to change in plans. I almost got the feeling that somehow this place was tabooed for us until I stumbled upon the travelzoo deal. We had 1 appetizer, 2 mains and 2 limited selection beverages to choose from. For appetizer, we shared the mushroom crostini which came out pretty quickly. The flavors were there but the texture was off since the crostini was extremely soggy. For mains, we ordered the risotto and halibut. Unfortunately, the wait for these dishes was so long that we were frustrated by the time they arrived at our table. Only a couple of tables were occupied and I really cannot fathom what was going on inside the kitchen to justify the kind of delay we experienced. Even a big group of ladies next to our table complained to the server for the slow service. We skipped dessert since we thought we had stayed there way too long for our meal. The risotto had good flavor due to the asparagus but was a bit watered down. I wish they put more salsa verde on the halibut, it was too dry. The menu holds a lot of promise with quality ingredients but the execution is flawed. Not worth the 40 minute streetcar ride for me!!"}
{"text":"Thank-you Yelpers for recommending this place. A friend and I were looking for a place to have brunch that was within walking distance of the finish of the Toronto half marathon.  The reviews I read were very positive and so was our experience.  The food was great- we both had the scrambled eggs with brie and spinach (delicious!) and it came with several sides (toast, salad, potatoes, fruit, and choice of meat (e.g. bacon, merguez sausage).  The coffee was very good and I also had a Stiegel Radler (a low alcohol \"grapefruit\" beer)-  very refreshing.  The servers were very attentive and friendly.  I highly recommend it and I will be back (maybe after the Sporting Life 10K?)"}
