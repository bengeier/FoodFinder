{"text":"Came here today for early dinner before a concert.  Had the fish fry. It was very good. The piece of grouper was huge and the beer batter coating was nice and crunchy. A real revelation was the slaw with gorganzola. I could have eaten a gallon. Delish!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Nickleby's one Saturday afternoon for a burger & beer.  My husband had their breakfast potatoes skins that where so over cooked & hard, you couldn't eat them, burnt and tasteless.    I ordered a hamburger with the special sauce and chips.   The burger was good and the bun was cold, like it just came out of the freezer.  I have always enjoyed the homemade chips, crunchy with salt very yummy.     The ones I had where like left over from the nite before.   I could not believe that a restaurant I had enjoyed so many times before could serve food like this so very, very disappointing.     I  do not believe I will visit again to order food.  Beers are always good."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but I used to be a downtown Willoughby regular back in the day - but since moving to away from the area I've been much more of a sporadic visitor as of late.  So when planning a recent dinner meeting, my friend (and business partner!) suggested we meet at Nickleby's and I had no idea what she was talking about when she said it was in DTW (has it been THAT long since I've been to this little strip?!).  But I'm glad she picked it!  The place is small and kind of dive-y,  but it also s pleasant and cozy bar atmosphere.  We went pretty early on a weekday night and  there wasn't a whole lot of regular DTW action, so the noise and crowd level were at a minimum, but I can imagine this place gets uncomfortably packed on a Friday or Saturday night.

As for the food, I thought it was really good for bar food.  You HAVE to get the pretzel appetizer - especially if you're a soft pretzel lover like me!  They're buttery and just the perfect amount of doughy that will make you wanting more.  That night I had the chicken salad sandwich, which was really good - not too much mayo and more than enough chicken - totally worth it.  I've also had their soup - I thought it was on the salty side, and I'm a total salt lover, so I wouldn't really recommend (but hey, maybe they got a little salt heavy that day - s**t happens).   The salads are also a healthy serving of lettuce and whatever goodness you choose on top.  

If you're looking for a quick place to grab a bite and want a casual atmosphere but with great food, then give this place a go.  You'll leave happy. :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of potato chips usually but there's we're delicious. Also had great Bloody Mary's and awesome Buffalo Chicken Dip. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went first time for a Christmas party. LOVE. We have been back 4 times. Nice bar, great bar staff, awesome food. So far we had grilled cheese, chicken salad, fried bologna,  mac and cheese with chicken, and burger.  This is our weekend stop now because food is Awesome!   Plus they have Purple Haze beer on draft."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for the brunch menu.  The service was great (Thanks Carly), the place was clean.  We tried the Tato skins that were very good.  I have the South Western Quesadilla which was excellent.  We plan on going back and try some of the other items on the menu.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times now and all I can say is the place is great.  Their homemade chips are great, the people are wonderful too.  Highly recommend going there!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Nickelby's with a party of 6 for a late dinner last Saturday night.  We were seated immediately even though the place was transitioning into \"bar mode\".  Our server was quick, fun, and spot on.  Half of us ordered burgers, the other half ordered tacos - all were satisfied.  They have awesome appetizer and beer menus so I definitely plan on hitting a happy hour at the round bar in the near future!"}
{"text":"Staff is awesome!!! Food was spot on! They had an Autumn Sangria that was delicious!!! The chicken salad was fresh and the burger was great!! Great beer selection too! Every time we go they have a wide variety of craft beers on tap"}
{"text":"Went to Downtown Willoughby after getting jilted on a reservation at another establishment on Mentor Avenue.

Had a spectacular waitress who knew the menu perfectly.

The wife and I split an appetizer and then I ordered the house salad.

I could not decide and ask the waitress to select my entree and it was superb, my wife had the chicken wings with mac & cheese which she also thought was spectacular.

Great atmosphere, menu, and service at very reasonable prices.

They treat people right!"}
{"text":"While the bartender staff did not know their best-selling items or favorites the quality of the food and the quality of the service was excellent however I was there at 2:30 PM on a Monday doing some work while my family was at the movies    I had the fried bologna sandwich which was amazing, be sure to have it cut thin and get the onions on the side.   The music was good but about every third song it would stop playing and then switch to a different channel which was odd and mentally annoying."}
{"text":"good spot, good food, friendly service...good corned beef sandwich"}
{"text":"The place  is clean, nice decorations and seating I just wasn't crazy about what I ordered. Service was excellent but I wouldn't suggest the steak tacos. We had the stuffed zucchini appetizer which I would get again . The rest of my party liked their food I just wasn't crazy about what I got like I said, but would try again especially for brunch"}
{"text":"Wonderful specials for happy hour, bar food menu and good dinner menu.  Also a good brunch selection including breakfast potato skins lol. The burgers are tasty, the hot dogs are good - macaroni and cheese I would pass on - as I would the salsa (not spicy and a corn black bean mix) - odd.  The buffalo chicken skins are off the chain though! (Like I said we eat a lot of bar food here). 

The desserts change daily - Kit Kat cheesecake is good but not New York style baked - more like a pudding style - while the pumpkin one in the fall had a better consistency I would ask if you want true cheesecake taste."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is strange.  I spent most of my meal, which I'm pretty sure came from Taco Bell, being screamed at from 2' away by a 50+ divorcee.  Food was marginal at best.  Service was pleasant but mostly absent.  Beer selection above average.

I've never seen so many shouting retirees before.  Definitely unsettling, and just obnoxious in general."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to love this place. Let's face it...the interior has great ambiance, the location is good...

I've tried it multiple times (at least 5). Ordered food each time. The menu SEEMS like it would be interesting. The resulting order is usually...blah. It's not horrible, but certainly not better than OK. Really.. boring.  

I'm TRULY disappointed that I am not in love with this place. It has potential. The menu kills it. Beer selection is OK.   Bartenders usually friendly. Like I said.. I really wanted to love this place.  That's why I kept giving it a chance.  Oh well."}
{"text":"My wife is from Willoughby, and when we visit, (we live in Texas) she always wants to eat in \"DTW\". This trip, we came to Nickleby's. We were very happy with the overall experience, and the food was quite enjoyable. Our server, Christy, was friendly and helpful, the noise level was average, and the people-watching was fun. I'd recommend the place to anyone new or familiar with the area. We'll be back one day."}
{"text":"The beau and I were visiting from out of town and we had a great experience here!  Many of the patrons of this establishment were easy-going and the service was great.  

We hopped to another bar early in the evening, but we enjoyed it so much (the drink selection was also great for the price) that we came back!

Restrooms were clean and there was never a line for the use of them."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars at Nicklebys! Good food, sweet service and a cool environment."}
{"text":"Food was hot and fast. Just had apps.  They have problems with their guiness taps though.  They are new(er) and I think that they will be a great addition to the Willoughby bar/restaurant scene.  I guarantee I will go there again!"}
{"text":"Nickleby's surprised me with how nice it was inside. Clean, friendly waiters, tons of flat-screens to watch games on."}
{"text":"Nickelbys is a great place for quiet drinks and big parties. Our company Christmas party was here last year and they did an amazing job! The staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and nice. 

Highly recommend for date night or girls night - you can actually chat and enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"We've been complaining that there isn't a unique brunch place in downtown Willoughby, but we were pleasantly surprised by breakfast at Nickelby's. The breakfast menu is limited and there isn't a menu with descriptions of the food which makes it a little hard to navigate.  I had pan seared oatmeal- steel cut oatmeal cut into four large triangles and pan seared with cinnamon and yogurt and fruit garnish.  My boyfriend had the southwestern quesadilla which was amazing! Homemade tortillas, eggs, veggies, avocado with lime juice, meat, and beans.  They also have sliders- three pancake sandwiches with eggs and sausage."}
{"text":"Went on around 5 on a Monday so it was pretty empty. The bartender was also our waitress. She made a great mixed drink. The pretzels for our appetizer were wonderful, hot and the perfect texture. As good as they were, kind of expensive as an appetizer but similar to other prices. I had a reuban, my husband had a burger. Very happy with both although my meat was a little on the dry side. Still tasty and large portions. Saved half for lunch and they were just as good the next day. The background music choices were great too."}
{"text":"Went there on a whim on Saturday the 18th and everything was great. They have a good selection of apps and drinks. My wife and I shared some apps that were very good.(especially the pimento cheese sliders!) I had two bloody marries, so you know they were good! I will defiantly be back to have dinner sometime. Oh! They have brunch too!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My favorite lunch spot for their veggie burger and sweet potato fries. The veggie burger is the 2nd best I've had, behind my workplace. So yummy! The avocado aioli hits the spot! And those sweet potato fries...oh my god yummmm! The dipping sauce is a maple butter like sauce and it is to die for! The fries are awesome by themselves but the sauce is so good I still dip them. I keep saying I'm going to try something new each time I go in but I can't get myself to steer away from my usual. Maybe next time...or the next after that. The bartenders are so nice and make me feel welcome since I usually go in by myself. love you nickleby's!"}
{"text":"Nickleby's is an interesting place to while away a few hours in a cozy bar on the main drag in Willoughby. The interior is inviting and there are tons of places to sit 'Round' the bar. 

They have an eclectic micro brew selection; I personally liked the Kentucky Bourbon Ale on draught, aged in spent bourbon casks. Their food is interesting too, I tried the steak salad, it came prepared in a way I haven't had it before- with sautéed onions on top of the iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good beer selection. I went here craving a burger and was disappointed with the quality and price. I could have had a better burger from five guys for half the price. The burger served to me was missing a key ingredient because \"they ran out\". I didn't make a fuss of it, but I was dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Went in today to watch the inauguration of President Trump. Wanted to watch the Fox News coverage. The two waitresses refused to put Fox News on and told us the owners only want CNN in in their restaurant. We left and went next door to Oliver Twist which is owned by the same people. They were very accommodating and gave us a great table near the tv and put up the volume. Spent over $200.00 on a slow afternoon on drinks and food. Shame on you Nickelbees. Trust me I will not forget this."}
{"text":"I just have to say it is sad when your own cousin will not even give your bar a good review. 

I probably go to Nickleby's about once or twice every few weeks. I would call myself a regular. On a particular Thursday night a few friends and I headed out to Nickleby's to watch our friend's band play. We each had a few Margaritas then she went on to Corona Lights and I had a few Magic Hats. WE were by no means drunk at all and when we received our bill we were shocked to see it was over $70.00! On further examination we could see that our server had charged us for 4 margaritas,( we only had three) and then four Magic Hat- I had 3 and then 7 Coronas. This again was not right. When she came back over, I approached her and said that our bill seemed to be wrong, I gave her the specific examples and she automatically got defensive with me told me that what we had drank that night was on the bill, looked at us both and told us she would give us a few minutes to settle up with each other and be back. 

I was so pissed off at that point and I thought about calling over the manager but at that point all I wanted to do was pay the bill and leave.
I understand that mistakes happen and hell maybe we did have 4 margaritas (but we didn't) but the fact that every drink she charged us was inconsistent with what we actually drank that night was a red flag. 

I definitely will not go back there and if I am every forced to I will be bringing a pencil and paper and keeping my own tab.  They should also improve on their food menu, we have eaten there a few times and every time I finish it reminds me not to order food from there again. The only reason this place is in business is because of the location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go in DTW.  Awesome food and I love the atmosphere. No matter lunch or dinner it has yet to disappoint. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour Friday, nice little spot. Overly the bar wasn't as crowded as I like but I got the buffalo chicken dip and chips. It was a little dry, my friend got the fried provolone cheese which was good. I also got a miller lite and pump king beer. Happy hour prices are good Miller lite 2 bucks and chips and dip 4.50. But the pump king beer was 7 bucks."}
{"text":"YUM!!. Amazing Reuben!!! The first time I got this I could not believe how much meat they put on it!!! And the meat isn't chewy, it simply melts in your mouth!! This is by far my favorite place to get a Reuben!
       Don't forget to try the buffalo chicken dip!! It's a good sized portion and it's absolutely delicious! Their grilled chicken sandwich is delicious if you're feeling health conscious, or just want a really good chicken sandwich! I also love love love their version of mozzarella sticks. It's 2 big slices rather than sticks and it lays in their delicious marinara!
      Theres a full Bar and a great selection of drinks. Its right in Downtown Willoughby so enjoy the other bars, delicious restaurants and cute shops!  You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"eh ive been there quite a few times to try to give it more of a chance and each time Im just not feeling it. The round bar makes for a very loud atmosphere, any time i have to raise my voice to speak to the bartender Im immediately turned off. The crowd seems to be mainly cougar and middle aged divorcees. The beer selection is the one thing saving the place but doesnt quite make it after a few drinks. I have not tried the food yet though, so maybe there is more of a saving grace to the place."}
{"text":"Love this place and the family who owns it! The service is always great! Food amazing every time!"}
{"text":"I come here frequently. Great burgers, nice options for vegetarians. Upgrade to the seasoned fries you won't be sorry. 

Happy hour is half off dips and great drink specials. Hummus is amazing. Everything is very fresh. Staff is pleasant. Best chill place in DTW."}
{"text":"This is the best bar in DTW. Excellent beer selection with consistently good food. It's the ideal atmosphere to be your local watering hole. No question the top patio in town. They started a new brunch menu on Saturdays and it's can't miss. Get the Bloody Mary for brunch...it will become your favorite."}
{"text":"Solid service and yummy food. This is a super relaxed environment where it would be great to catch up with buddies over HH specials. May I say that the bavarian pretzel is one of the best I've ever had? I mean, if we were dating, bavarian pretzel, I don't see why we would ever break up. You are warm, cheesy, just my type..

Just wanted to add: Staff is super awesome and makes a really good fresh squeezed, certifiable 'rita. Superman had a guiness, short. They did not miss a beat and offered him seconds once he finished the first glass. Second Rita and g'nite señorita...three hours later and I had the best sleep ever. Drink responsibly amigos."}
{"text":"Popped in for an early Saturday afternoon lunch. It might have even been before noon, I forget. But Nickleby's had their lunch menu up and running. I had(tears) some of the most(puts hand over heart) DELICIOUS wings ever here. They were smothered in the mysterious white barbecue sauce that is all the rage now. It's like the absinthe of barbecue sauces. All the cool bohemians are doing it. Of course great location, great decor. That's par for the course in DTW nowadays. I hoist this gnawed off chicken bone and wish you years of success, Nickleby's!"}
{"text":"So, with the somewhat limited,and redundant choices DTW has to offer, Nickleby's isn't too shabby. I have had 2 meals here. The first, the Lemon Chicken. Chicken was great, moist, and the sauce met it's description. But, I asked if the green beans were fresh?  \"Yes they are fresh\". No, they were frozen. At least not canned! Hahahaha!
Anyway. Second trip.  Buffalo chicken dip. I requested to be served with pitas vs. tortilla chips. Pitas...awesome. Very much like another fine pub in DTW.  But the dip, it was just ok. Not much taste, and it hardened  very quickly. Couldn't taste any chicken.

My friends salad looked really good. The chopped Romaine. I will definetly go back to try more menus items. With a little tweeking, this place will have a great menu."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday night, just before the overwhelming Willoughby Bar Rush began.

The food here is good. Not great, but good. We started with the Erie Street Pretzels, which had a great flavor, but were nothing too special. I ordered a steak salad. The steak in the salad was prepared medium, as i had requested. the salad itself was made of a mix of iceberg and romaine. Seriously, why do any restaurants other than, say, fast food chains use iceberg? gross. I also didn't like the grilled onions on the salad at all.

I also ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. It seemed to be made from the same cheese sauce that came out with our pretzels, a little shredded cheddar, and a sprinkle of bread crumbs on top. Passable, but Willoughby Brewing Company's mac and cheese is far superior.

I was impressed by the service, even as the bar got busier. Their beer selection is decent and reasonably priced. Their jukebox was awesome on the evening we visited (although we made our exit once somebody started playing Whitney Houston).

Overall, not bad. Not great, either. But not bad."}
