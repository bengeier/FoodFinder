{"text":"If you want some seriously incredible Caribbean flavors-check this spot out. Vegan - Vegetarian dishes what more can you ask for. I can eat everything on the menu"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for a super-healthy, delicious, comfort vegan food on the go. Very relaxed atmosphere, very friendly and very well-priced. My only complaint is that they are frequently closed / out of food when I'm on way home and hungry later in the evening. Sigh! :("}
{"text":"This was my first time here after reading so much about it and wow, was it amazing! The owners very friendly and offered samples as well. Very delicious, can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"FOOD IS INCREDIBLE, STAFF IS FRIENDLY, AND IT'S SO CUTE! Okay but seriously, we walked in, and the worker behind the desk asked us if we wanted samples BEFORE buying the food. What a great idea! And because the food was so delicious, they allowed me to get a bit of everything!! It was seriously fantastic, I highly recommend! (plus, it's really affordable and filling!)"}
{"text":"Awesome! Never knew vegan tasted this good and I'm definitely covinced to try out a vegan diet. Get the meal combo for $9.75 and you'll be able to try most of the dishes available in small amounts. Thumbs up for the variety and the big portion which kept me full for a while!"}
{"text":"Really friendly service, the owner took his time to explain the food and provided samples. Lots of care and attention goes into the meals here. Plus its healthy and delicious. I got a little bit of everything. Worth the $10 price. Nice atmosphere too. I love the post-it notes on the wall!!"}
{"text":"That this is the best vegan Caribbean good in town is not a huge statement, though there's some competition. But this is some of the best food in town, period. Only a few choices, but all of them fantastic. The couple (?) who run the place are also wonderfully friendly and enthusiastic. Whenever I bring friends (which is whenever I can) they take pleasure in explaining the options and giving samples of everything."}
{"text":"Wandered in to this place accidentally and boy did it exceed my expectations.

The place has an absolutely lovely atmosphere, - 
the owner asked if it was my first time there (and it was) so he took the time and offered me to taste test all of the protein options, which are the focus of the dishes, and they were all delicious at a really good price!

If you like some heat in your food, you can absolutely get it. The food itself isn't spicy when prepared, however the hot sauce options are great and range from 1 to AWESOME (scotch bonnet peppers kicked some flavourful ass!)

Overall have to agree with the other review, don't be in a rush when you come here,
take your time and enjoy the vibes."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The food is amazing. Get the chickpea curry and the split pea roast! My husband loves the jerk seitan. Wish I lived in Toronto i would come here all the time."}
{"text":"Peter was incredible and the food was too! Vegan roti with chickpeas, seitan and veggies... incredible. Great idea to offer free food to first time goers so you know exactly how good it is, and really Peter's presentation and style are a big part of the entire experience. I highly recommend, even if you're NOT vegan"}
{"text":"The best vegan restaurant in town.  The food is delicious.  You can definitely taste the difference between a quick meal and something that's made with love.  I love that no animals are harmed in making these wonderful dishes!  Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Everything is SO DELICIOUS. The jerk seitan and their apricot sauce for the tofu are awesome. So many amazing flavours. So well-priced. The shop owner/workers are so friendly. I cant recommend this place enough!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, cool vibe and great staff that really love what they do! You can get a choice of three meals or all 3 in one. So much delicousness in the accents and veggies used. A true health food resto that tastes amazing"}
{"text":"Been keeping an eye on this place since it opened this year and yesterday my date and I checked it out.  We were given samples of the protein (jerk seitan, split pea roast and chickpea curry).  I opted for the chickpea meal and my date had a jerk seitan roti to go.  We were not disappointed.  It was delicious and I was pleasantly surprised by the split pea roast, alfalfa and green beans added to the meal.  I love comfort food and this meal touched my veggie soul.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!!! I have been here twice now and both times it has been exceptional! First time we were here we got to sample everything. Everyone working was so extremely nice and welcoming. I can't emphasis enough how great the food was both times - so much care put into making it clearly. Even if you are not vegan you will enjoy their food."}
{"text":"YES.  This is what shows Vegetarian not only belongs in 2017 but has a huge future. Small but gorgeous modern interior (low ambient lighting worthy of date night). Range of sub-types of Vegetarian on the menu.  I admit I went three nights in a row earlier this year (hey, when the opportunity is there...) and every. single. thing. was delicious. 

Veggie Brothers & Sisters: make the investment, go, revel in a moment of chic & delicious. 

Non-Veggie Folks, if you are thinking about it: go, have a mod & sophisticated meal.  

And remember: the future is veggie/vegan (environmental, health, humane)."}
{"text":"I ordered using Foodora and I loved everything. I got their lunch deal which had their jerk seitan, over brown rice, a side salad, and a side of curried chickpeas. I also got a pineapple ginger drink.

Amazing flavor. Out of all the vegan restaurants I've been to, this was the most flavourful. They are not afraid of spices. The texture of the seitan was acceptable. It was not too soft but it wasn't as chewy as real meat. This container was packed with veggies so youll definitely be full. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a hearty meal. It can get spicy over time but cool off with a pineapple ginger juice!"}
{"text":"Visited Kensington market on a Friday afternoon and holy crap!!! This place was AMAZING!!!!!  

Service: 5/5 - nicest gentleman working there!

Ambiance: its a small interior with about 10-ish spots for people to sit comfortably. If have a bigger party -likely better to carry out. 

The food..... the quality of ingrediants are fantastic!

Oh man! Its so incredibly good!!!! Everything on the menu was fantastic & carried a wonderful food profile. Great portion for the price. Highly highly recommend this place esp to any vegetarians!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and chill atmosphere. Owner Peter will greet you and make your food with love. The jerk seitan is just enough heat and sweetness. Love the split pea roast! Don't be in a rush when you come. Relax and enjoy the experience- island style!"}
{"text":"Great spot! The owner puts tons of love into every plate he serves. You get a very filling meal with what you pay for and the variety is amazing. def try it!"}
{"text":"Cool place with chill people, the food is maybe not so good looking but yet it's very tasty and delicious. They have gluten free options too."}
{"text":"At first we had come to Kensington for another restaurant and while walking past Veggie D'Light we caught this amazing scent coming from their doors. Had an amazing meal, Jerk Seitan with chickpeas, jack fruit, moringa bread. The staff were extremely friendly and provided a lot of information about the food. Now I know what it's like to be in a state of nirvana. Great for vegetarians. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The server was down to earth, genuine, and really pleasant to talk with. I really appreciate how she allowed us to have samples of the meal before we ordered. I enjoyed the jerk seitan with a mix of purple rice, quinoa, and flaxmeal grain. I also tried the moringa loaf which tasted like mashed potato in a loaf from with gravy. I like the atmosphere in the restaurant as I find it very inviting due to its bright and warm colors."}
{"text":"Want some comfort food that you won't feel horrible after consuming? Veggie D is your G. No wonder they seem to have quite the following. The owner is great and if you say that it's your first time you might be offered to sample a bit of everything. Just make sure that you're not in a rush as there is a relaxed vibe in the shop. Split pea roast, sorrel, jerk seitan, chickpea curry... mmm - can't wait to try more goods!"}
{"text":"The nicest owner. 
Delicious hearty food. 
AND it's vegan (with gf options). 

I told the owner I eat gluten-free, and he didn't hesitate to make me a delicious plate of all of the gf options of the day. Vegan & carribean comfort food. Also, the ginger and pineapple drink is fresh and delcious."}
{"text":"The guy who owns this place is good vibes all around. He loves his moringa powder and was telling us all about it as he gave samples and made recommendations. The food was filling, satisfying, and made me feel good which doesn't happen often with take-out. I also LOVED the Sorrel as well as the pineapple ginger drink with chia seeds in it. Yum."}
{"text":"I have been here once before a few years ago. I came back for my second visit on Sunday. My friend is a new (born again) Vegan! I arrived first and started chatting with the man behind the counter, I should have asked his name. A very nice and kind man. I told him I was flexitarian (he laughed) and I inquired about some of his dishes. 

I went with the roti and he said he put this and that in it. I should have paid closer attention. It was delicious! Now I don't know what was in it! Ha! So fresh and tasty! A very good size portion. My friends had a combo dish and it looked huge and tasty. My friend paid so I don't know how much stuff was but I would pay whatever it was so good. 

He brought us a taste of a vegan brownie looking item. The texture was unique and it had a familiar taste, like having a flashback to something. He told us what was in it and then it dawned on me. Christmas cake but without all those nasty green and red cherry things! Ha! 

This flexitarian will be back! Oh I love the positivity wall filled with compliments and love on sticky notes."}
{"text":"First of all, I am a devout carnivore. I hardly eat veggies, and I know I should eat them more often. After a particularly heavy weekend of junk food and alcohol, I decided on a light vegetable dinner, and this place did not disappoint.

4.5/5 - Food (I'll round down)

The food was packed full of flavour. Every bite was so good, I didn't mind that it was all vegetables. I had the jerk seitan, and the sauce was perfectly spicy. My only complaint is that if you're not used to seitan (wheat gluten) it does taste funny. it has a gummy texture and a weird after taste.

I would have liked if they had more meat substitutes, especially some that would have the same texture as meat. However, overall, my tastebuds, wallet, and bowels were satisfied with this meal.

Great place to have a vegan meal, especially for those meat eaters that are scared of flavourless veggies."}
{"text":"Fantastic, delicious, rich healthy food served by a very cool guy who clearly loves what he does. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Before this weekend, my impressions of the Toronto vegan restaurant scenery were pretty negative. I thought that most of the vegan places were average overpriced restaurants serving food that I could essentially cook myself. And then Veggie D'Light happened.

Until further notice, this is my new favorite restaurant.

It's DELICIOUS, the price is CHEAP, and there is AMAZING SERVICE. Winning combo.

Let's start with the food. So freaking good. I got the small meal combo and the lentil soup. The meal combo came with the jerk seitan (which is the perfect combination of spices) and the curry chickpeas (I could write a love poem about this). And the lentil soup was a delicious creamy explosion of flavors. Everything is completely vegan!!!! As someone who recently found out they are lactose intolerant, this was amazing to hear, because I love creamy soups.

The price is super reasonable too! Probably one of the least expensive vegan places in Toronto.

And the service!!! Since it was our first time, we were given samples of the food, which is honestly such a great concept. Like, I wish every other restaurant did that. I like to know what I'm signing up for before ordering my food.

Anyway, Veggie D'Light has a great homy vibe. I will 100% be going back for more."}
{"text":"My new favorite vegetarian restaurant! Food is fresh, flavorful and filling. Tried their spin on jerk chicken and it was amazing, looking forward to trying the curry Roti. Hope they open more locations, think that everyone would enjoy this!"}
{"text":"Best food in Toronto, not just vegan but food period. I've been here three or four times and I just love the flavours and how I feel after eating the food - comforted, full and happy. The jerk seitan, salad and roti are my favorite but the magic is in how everything mixes in the plate and I am hooked. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"We chose this place at random during a long layover in Toronto. Coming from Salt Lake City, vegan Caribbean food is not something we usually see so of course we had to try it out. Its in a pretty awesome location of the Kensington Market, a small place but that didn't matter since it wasn't busy when we arrived in the late(r) part of the afternoon. The lady who helped us let us try a few samples of their main courses so we could get an idea of what we were in the mood for. Both my husband and I opted for ALL OF IT and it was soooo good! The chickpea curry was probably my favorite, his was the jerk seitan. I really, really liked the pea roast that the combo came with too! They have a yummy hot chili oil that we poured on everything to give it all an extra kick and we left there so happy that we chose it!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, chill space, and extremely filling plant-based grab-and-go food! Perfect for  workday lunches since all the ingredients are protein-rich and complex rather than simple carbs, so no more afternoon sugar slumps :) Small meal combos are $7 and large are $12. Each combo comes with a choice of protein (or 2 or 3 if you want to substitute out carbs and/or veggies), a carb, and veggies (raw). Today's soup of the day (~$5) has a stew-like, heavier lentil base, very filling and reasonably seasoned, not too salty but probably more on the bland side. As much as I liked the whole grain basmati rice from the sample one of the chefs gave me, I opted out of my choice of carb for 2 choices of protein. The chickpeas were fine, but jerk seitan may be more of an acquired taste as it was spicy and sweet with an interesting (not exactly meat-like) texture. I was actually so satisfied afterwards, so 10/10 would return again! Lost 1 star since the space inside - although cozy - was quite cramped and the prices could be just a teeny bit lower for the portion sizes served.

They do cater.

There is WiFi, but you must ask for the passcode.

They only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"Incredibly flavourful, healthy, nutritious food and love that no animals were harmed in the making. This is my go-to restaurant if I don't have time to cook. I'm so happy that they are close to where I live and work and it's easy to stop by."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, i like this place because their menu is pretty healthy. Taste of food is good and the price is not too high. Its small place so your order is ready fast. I would recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"Everything I look for in a casual lunch/to-go spot. Really delicious, healthy, homemade food with great service and great value. Especially loved the curried chickpeas and the moringa loaf. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian food and you can tell the chef loves his work."}
{"text":"Vggie D'Light is so delicious!  I walk out of my way to get this for lunch every week.  The atmosphere is chill and the owner's/employees are really customer oriented.  The food is well priced and you can taste the quality.  My fav is the jerk seitan but there is nothing on this menu I won't eat.  Highly recommend Veggie D'Light for a delicious, filling, well priced meal in the Kensington area!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If you are in the mood for some Caribbean food and happen to be vegetarian? There aren't too many options that I can think of. Thankfully, there's Veggie D'light and, like I said, it's awesome.

The staff is super friendly (5 stars). When we came in for the first time, we didn't know what we wanted, we were given the chance to sample the different options. The dilemma is that everything tastes great. We decided to get two different options and share. 

The portion is very generous. We had no problems finishing the meals. You know it's good when you eat something and have a smile the whole time.

A couple of things to note. It's a small place with limited seating. It does seem to have a crowd of people come through, so come early to get a table. It's got a limited number of options, which from what I can tell changes from the times I've come in. The jerk seitan is as good as others have yelped about here!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Caribbean vegan food in a warm and welcoming spot. I used to come here when Hot Beans was here. The split pea roast, jerk seitan, the chickpea curry all are delicious and as others have pointed out made with love by the owners. It also feels so much healthier than some Caribbean food which can sometimes be greasy. even if it is veg. When we were there Peter offered up samples of the food to a family that were checking him out (we told them the food was great...eating is believing...they had just eaten lunch and wished they had eaten there instead!"}
{"text":"The staff here is friendly and this place has such a good reputation that I hate to give it a bad review. But here we are. 

After an awful first experience, we went back today on a friend's recommendation. It was definitely better, but I still can't say I'm impressed. 

We got the small combo platter with jerk seitan and chickpeas on purple rice. The chickpeas were fine, but kind of bland. The jerk seitan had an odd sour aftertaste, so I can't recommend it. This place is great if you're looking for healthy hippie-ish food, but I'm not. I probably won't be giving Veggie D'Light a third chance."}
{"text":"I went to Veggie D'Light when visiting Toronto as the first stop on a Kensington food crawl. Once I had their small combo platter though (curried chickpeas, jerk seitan, moringa loaf, brown rice w/flax, veggies) I was so full that I spent the rest of the evening (contentedly) watching other people eat. 

For $7 (I believe), you get a heaping/awesome mix of vegan Carribean food. Why are more people not coming here?!"}
{"text":"Well, the owner is the chef and runs the place by himself, the food prepared is fresh just like homemade, light vegan food. He is kind and cheerful. Its a single hand running eatery. But I find the food just okay. I tried different stuff couple of times, but could not agree with the 5-star reviews. If you are in Kensington, looking for vegan food, this should not be your first choice."}
{"text":"Does NOT disappoint!  The restaurant is chill and pretty small, and the vibe is definitely relaxed.  I would probably opt for taking the food to go and eating it at home though, just because there isn't a lot of space.  That being said, the food is amazing.  Vegan food that doesn't taste bland or boring and packs a powerful flavour.  Get the meal combo and ask to try a bit of everything, it's the best way to go!  The jerk seitan is nicely spicy and the chickpea curry is total comfort food.  Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Being vegetarian in Michigan, I've never really had Caribbean food. I was excited when I saw this place in the neighborhood I'm visiting in Toronto. And I was even more excited when I got my food!

The person behind the counter was very friendly and gave us samples of soup and the three protein choices. They all tasted fantastic. I picked the jerk seitan and curried chickpeas small combo, and my partner got a small combo with maringa loaf and chickpeas. We both loved our meals and couldn't quite finish them; the small is plenty big for lunch!

The atmosphere was pleasant, with lots of dark wood and a reggae/hip hop/r&b radio station playing. There's not a lot of seating, but we snagged seats at the bar looking out the window. We got to people watch and also advertise for the restaurant as we enjoyed our food on display. :)

We had trouble when it was time to pay. They don't accept credit cards, and our American Visa debit cards weren't working with their machine. We found an ATM nearby.

Accessibility note: this place would be hard to navigate if you use a wheelchair, crutches, or a cane, or if you're larger than average. You have to go down steps to get to the counter and there's a very narrow passage."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem. The food is hearty and delicious, the flavours are superb. Oh and the vibe is always friendly!"}
{"text":"D'Light, D'Best, D'licious! 

This unassuming restaurant speaks volumes with its food. The gentleman (I believe it's the owner?) is always welcoming and happy to see you. Since there are always different options, he usually gives everyone little \"samplers\" to try out what you like. EVERYTHING IS GOOD - it's just a matter of what tastes the best. 

I'm a personal fan of the jerk seitan, the black eyed peas (when they're available), and the split pea roast. I would highly recommend getting the combo so it's served a bed of rice, flaxseed, and other goodies. You'll find that the sauce and food on top soaks into this bed of carbs and makes it so much better. 

The only item I haven't tried yet that I've been dying to is the Pineapple Ginger drink. I will post another review once I cross that off the list."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Veggie D for the past 5 weekends in a row and I just dont have enough good things to say about the restaurant. I feel sad for the poor people who walk by and dont come inside. Im not a vegan but everytime I leave here I feel energized, satiated, happy and ready to take on the day (not lethargic and full). The food is a vegan take on jamaican classics, pairing the wonderful savory and spicy flavors with vegan dishes like seitan, beans, etc. Absolutely brilliant cooking, lovely staff and I'm always floored by the different items the kitchen is cooking up.  I usually get a mix of the jerk seitan and black eyed peas over rice with veggies and a nice ladle of the home-made hot sauce, oohwieee. so good. While I spring for the large(and keep half or so for a afternoon snack) a small portion here will fill you right up!

Frankly, if youre in kensington and eating anywhere else, you're either a tourist or a moron."}
{"text":"Veggie D'Light is d'lectable! The owner and chef at Veggie D'Light is a d'aler of d'licious addictive chickpea curry. 

I visited Veggie D'Light for lunch. It was my first time visiting. The owner was kind enough to offer samples of  their daily specials. Everything was great! I opted for a small meal combo ($5.99) with two items; curry chickpeas and moringa loaf. 

The moringa loaf must be an electrifying d'scovery to the whole vegan world. Moringa is a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. It also contains significant amount of protein! In short, it makes a positive d'fference in your health! I applaud the chef's creativity in morphing moringa powder into loafs! 

The second item, curry chickpea was box scrapping good! Spices from the curry such as cumin and turmeric aid d'gestion and reduce inflammation! I couldn't help but scrap the paper box for more after my meal was complete. Basmati Brown Rice with Flax and Quinoa was d'lightful with the curry. 

Look forward to my next visit!  It's D'bomb!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Thank you so much for what you are doing Peter! For someone who loves Caribbean food but who has also recently become a practicing vegan it's been a struggle to deny the Jerk Chicken cravings. No longer have to! We will be back.....often!"}
{"text":"Vegan Caribbean food...where have you 'bbean' all my life??

It's warming, fresh, & still has that distinct Caribbean spice. Essentially, they always serve 3 different 'proteins', 2 carb options, and fresh veggies. A small $9.99 combo lets you choose 2 proteins + 1 carb, while a large $14.75 combo gets you all 3 proteins. 

I got the small combo with Jerk Seitan & Curry Chickpea with the flax quinoa basmati brown rice. It was very filling, had great textures, and bright flavours. Some of the components were a little cold though because they've all been pre-cooked and just sitting out or in their pots. 

I would rate the food as 4/5, but what made this a 5 star review was the homey feel and wonderful samples I got! Upon walking in, it's a very small place with very limited seating. The owner greeted us and noticed we were obviously first-timers. He started bringing out samples of each of the proteins for us to try. He took his time to serve us and accommodated to any substitutions.

I'm so glad I finally got to try Veggie D'Light, I love the wholesomely delicious and vegan take on Caribbean cuisine!"}
{"text":"A friend took me here and I had the jerk with artificial meat. It was incredible. It really did taste like meat! I later took another friend here who is a vegan and she loved it! The owner Peter is really kind as well."}
{"text":"Searching for healthy vegetarian options in Yelp, Veggie d'light was described as Caribbean vegan with a great price $. I wanted to explore Kensington market on my first night here, and I also intended to socialize with the Caribbean crowd at some point during the weekend. And so I knew I couldn't go wrong. I spent my first ever evening in Canada at this lovely place with perfect food, good vibes and good people (including the owners!) who I hopefully see again."}
