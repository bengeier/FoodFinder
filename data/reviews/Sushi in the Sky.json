{"text":"The food was good. Very expensive for what you get with a cheap cafeteria plastic atmosphere. I had a simple roll and a sushi and coke 21$ plus a tip. Felt cheated"}
{"text":"Fast, affordable sushi! We moved to Port Credit a week ago and have eaten there twice - both times were take-out. Definitely going to become one of our favourite places! The building is a little pink house with some seating inside and on the sidewalk. The menu isn't huge, but it covers your basic sushi favourites, including rolls, sushi and party trays. They have a flat TV screen inside playing music videos of Japanese pop, which is fun. The prices here are quite good. I got a 10-piece dynamite roll for $4.43 plus HST = $5. My husband got a 12-piece California roll for $5 too. One thing to note - they only accept cash."}
{"text":"This place was great. The prices are unbelievable and the sushi is great for that price. They are very friendly and polite in their and the shop is a cute little place. I will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Freshest take out Sushi on the planet ... I mean in the sky. Amazing prices. Actually has a smell of clean inside. Food made fresh to order in a few minutes. I will go back again... definitely"}
{"text":"Excellent quality!  Very fresh and a great price.  One party platter came to around $30 and me and two other large gentleman could not finish it. The only down side is that there is no where to sit and it's cash only.   I recommend getting take out and eating it in the park."}
{"text":"The sushi here is always freshly made and consistently delicious! The couple that owns the restaurant always ensure the sushi is delicious and well made. I've never had a bad experience after coming here for several years. For affordable, delicious sushi, this place is awesome when your stomach doesn't want to handle all you can eat."}
{"text":"Very well done great price. The  service was perfect friendly . Sushi tasted so good."}
{"text":"Call to order take out and was told that they were very busy when I asked when I should call back he hung up on me. Have been. Frequent customer but will no longer be. Will stick with ordering from orange fish in Lorne Park"}
{"text":"Their sushi is the most inexpensive and delicious sushi I have ever had. Such friendly staff as well. Their dynamite rolls are incredible. Fast service too. I've recently been getting the Spicy Crunch Roll (vegetarian) which is amazing."}
{"text":"I have lived and worked in Port Credit for many years, but I haven't seen anything quite like Sushi in the Sky. The unassuming pink building just off Lakeshore at Stavebank betrays a warm, inviting atmosphere and great sushi.  It really is something else to walk in there for the first time - very spartan seating, Korean pop music videos playing on a TV on the back wall and the incredibly friendly cashier. Of course, a restaurant is nothing without the quality of the food, and this place delivers. While it won't exactly set the sky on fire, the sushi is fresh and tastes great. You can get a la carte options ($4-6 for 12 pieces or so), or grab a platter of 50-60 assorted pieces for about $20.  It's a great place if you're in a hurry or want to try something new - God knows we have enough bars and pizza places in Port Credit already. One thing to note, too - Sushi in the Sky only accepts cash, so make sure you have money on hand unless you want to walk down to the ATM at Rabba.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Walked in and walked out. The place smelled of bad fish. I doubt they will still be in business a year from now. I had such high hopes since Port Credit has so few sushi options"}
{"text":"I've been here almost weekly over the past summer & I'm hooked! And I drive from Brampton to the lakeshore in Mississauga just to grab their sushi! The sushi is beyond mindblowing. It's fresh, like made to order, right in front of you, with a smile. I'll even eat left overs the next day, which i never do with sushi, as it usually gets hard and soggy and gross. Not this stuff! The staff are super sweet, & always have fun Korean music videos playing. Price wise? Soo cheap for the quality you get! Seriously I don't know how they do it! It blows me away every time.  The party trays are the way to go for two or more people. But don't forget the seaweed salad, and crab & spicy cucumber salad! Soo delish!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad. The prices are incredibly cheap, but when they say you are getting 8 pieces in a roll it's because they're cutting them very small. The miso soup is good. Party trays have lots of pieces and are not too expensive. It's cash only. The prices all basically work out to a round number, kinda helpful. They pre-make a lot of the stuff that goes in the rolls so the hot things might no always be hot. The staff is very friendly, and, again, the prices are so low it almost makes up for the food not being the very best sushi I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was a little wary when I had to squeeze my wasabi out of a plastic wrapper, however, the food was pretty tasty for the price I paid.   You definitely get what you pay for here. Nothing special, but it hits the spot if you are looking for something quick and cheap."}
{"text":"The sushi is cheap and good. Whenever I need a party tray, this is my go to place. There are only two small tables inside so plan on getting it to go. Also if you're planning to get sushi for dinner or you have a large order, always call and order ahead because they run out quickly. The owners are very nice and if i make a large order they often throw in something extra. My favourite place for a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"Having lived in the neighbourhood for some time now, we've been anxiously hoping for a good, casual sushi place to open up. Our patience has been rewarded by the nice folks at Sushi in the Sky. Their sushi is simple but delicious, and incredibly cheap. If you're looking for great, cheap sushi rolls or nigiri to go this place is exactly what you need."}
{"text":"The little pink house is so cute! The staff were friendly and welcoming. Quick and fresh service. The food is delicious, they make the food right in front of you. The location is fairly small, fits max maybe 8 eat ins. Recommend for take outs only."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst.  If you want fast and cheap,sushi (and lots of it) than this is the place. I wound be making this \"my go to \" but I will be back in a pinch."}
{"text":"This isn't the best sushi but pretty good. It's quick and made to order so call ahead especially at dinner time. They don't offer any snow crab options. Cash only and really no seating room but its close to home and convenient. The staff is always friendly and polite."}
{"text":"I got the eel roll and the salmon sushi. Very different from all the other shush i places I've been in. Fresh and made with love. Unfortunately they didn't have sashimi but the salmon slices on the sushi were really thick and it was a good rice to fish ratio. Usually other places give you such a tiny amount of fish. The rice is very soft, absorbs A lot of the salmon. I love how cute the restaurant is and how the owners greet you in japenese! Ohayoo! Would recommend and will do continue to support!"}
{"text":"Sushi in the Sky is a fantastic value sushi restaurant in Port Credit.  You will get fresh sushi that tastes great and is made fresh to order.  You will see based on the menu that the prices are quite low, the sushi reflects that but not in poor quality.  Obviously (especially when it comes to nigiri sushi), you aren't going to get the thickest slices of fish for this price.  I have also had party trays from them and it is incredible what you get for the price.  The owners are always friendly and prepare your order as fast as possible.  They recommend to call ahead so that you aren't waiting around but walk-up orders are no problem.  Remember to bring cash as they are cash-only."}
{"text":"We were in a hunt for a different sushi place and stumbled upon Sushi in the Sky online, so decided to give it a shot. It's very easy to miss as it's off the main road and in a tiny pink house that could easily be mistaken for something like a candy/cupcake store.  We entered to find that there were only two tables, both of which were occupied. We decided to wait outside with the menu since one table occupied seemed like they was almost done.  The prices shocked me. This was by far one of the most affordable sushi places I've encountered, which made me hesitant and question the fish quality and freshness. They also seemed to lack variety in sushi items. The lady taking the order at the front desk was really friendly and took our orders with a smile.  The sushi was being made fresh, which was a huge relief. Once ready, since there was no table service, I had to go up and get my food.  So, they do not give fresh wasabi, whereby both the wasabi and soy sauce were out of a packet. The sushi sizes were also pretty small compared the the usual. We got a variety of nigiri sushi and a few California rolls.  On my first attempt to pick up my sushi with my chopstick, not only did the fish separate from the rice, but also the rice literally crumbled into individual grains right into the soy sauce.  Messy food and loose sushi when I'm starving is not a good combo for me! I was extremely disappointed and had to eat them all with my hands. Anyone who has tried good sushi should know that sushi should never fall apart. They shouldn't be too tightly packed either, but at least should hold together and be dippable in the soy sauce. I ate all my sushi and wasn't that full, since they were pretty small. But I didn't complain because the lady was really nice and for the price I cant really expect quality food like Hiro Sushi. I would rather eat food court sushi than go here again."}
{"text":"I was interested in this place because the outside is so cute, and wasn't disappointed when I finally went in and ordered something. I've tried the California roll and one of the party trays so far and enjoyed them both very much. The food comes quick and the woman working when I went in was extremely kind. I wouldn't say this is a place to go if you plan to sit inside with a group of people since it's very small, but it's a cheaper and great-tasting option if you want to grab a quick meal."}
