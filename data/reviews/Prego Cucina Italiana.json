{"text":"We visited Calgary from out of town and were looking for a good Italian place in this part of town. 

Service was great, quick, efficient, focused, and lots of smiles - so we felt welcome there which sounds funny to say but there are so many places to go where you feel like a burden.  but there was nobody there on this Tuesday evening so I think they were happy to see us!

I would say slightly overpriced but the portion size partially offset this. I have three young children and we ordered one salad and two pasta dishes and we were satiated.   The spaghetti was terrific."}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to start with the service which deserves more than 2 stars as it was the best part. The calamari and prawn appetizers were good, as was the wine. The main course which was the special for the night the Filet was horrible! I had to send my \"medium well\" back as the blood was pouring out as soon as I cut into it and they were two different sizes and I believe two cuts (which were not filet) it was tough, grainy and lacked flavour. I would not recommend the Steak. My husband also had the Filet and also had two different cuts ,one was over cooked and one was under cooked. The Chef needs to learn how to cook a steak. The veggies were old and soggy not crisp and fresh. Best part of the meal was the potatoes. Pretty bad for a $30.00 plus meal. I would say if I do return, I would try a pasta dish as this is probably their speciality."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and exceptional service makes for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"We wandered to Prince Island Park and ended up near Prego Cucina Italiana. We were so hungry we went to the first restaurant we saw. 

Prego is meant to be a fine dining restaurant so the atmosphere is naturally more stuffy and the prices are above average. However, the waiters are extremely prompt and the food is utterly fantastic.  

On a whim I ordered the gnocci with gorgonzola and it was one of the most delicious pasta dishes I have ever eaten. My other half ordered the tortellini dolce (without salmon) and he loved it as much as I loved my gnocci. 

I must say it again, the gnocci with gorgonzola is amazing!"}
{"text":"We came here because we were staying at the Sheraton Suites across the street and didn't feel like going to Joey's again. We were actually pleasantly surprised from start to finish. The food was excellent. The rack of lamb was amazing. I'm not a fan of \"game-y\" lamb but this lamb was great and cooked perfectly at medium rare. The sirloin with tiger prawns was also great. The rosé sauce was incredible. They had a wide selection of wines and the server we had was very knowledgable and experienced. I always find that waiters that can take orders without a notepad and pen to be the most elite in the service industry. The creme brûlée cheesecake was delicious!! The perfect end to a completely satisfying meal! We were honestly so happy with the service and the food and flavours. Our two year old ate everything from the lamb to the steak to the pasta. She loved everything from start to finish and she has an amazing taste for foods at her young age. Definitely would recommend and definitely would return!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch last week as a group of four.  We are all professionals working in small private O&G companies so dressed business casual.  

Serive:  We had reservations and arrived early, there were not that many tables seated, so we asked for a window.  We were told they were all reserved, but throughout the lunch hour, there were at least two that were not used at all.  It dawned on us afterwards that all the people seated at the window tables were WASP men with suits.  Also, the guy doing the seating was kind of snobby.

Food - calamari - lightly battered, little bit greasy, nothing extraordinary.  Bruschetta - again, nothing special, Itialian friend at the table said it was actually not so good.  I had the Seafood pasta, thought it was OK, not great.

All in all, average Itialian food with snobby service - so will not be returning.

Too many other choices of fabulous Italian food in Calgary."}
{"text":"Our Team had finished up our work and it was time to say our goodbyes and go home. And after 2+ weeks on the road and away from Gayle, I was ready to head out to YYC right then and there. However, there was still time for one last Lunch together.

The Eau Claire Market has had its challenging times, especially if you wander through the food court downstairs. But upstairs is the stalwart presence of Prego Cucina Italiana.

We wandered in and snagged the last big table during a busy lunch hour. We were seated almost right up against the kitchen counter and serviced by a bald gentleman, with a mustache, thick Italian accent, and a flare for excellent service. We had wine, we devoured out pasta, we laughed, we talked, and we left as family. Prego was an excellent coda to a most enjoyable and educational life experience."}
{"text":"Great Italian food tucked away at the top of Eau Claire mall.

There is nothing bad that I could say about this restaurant except that it is quite expensive (although worth it). I received great service throughout the meal and received my food very quickly. The food was exceptional and I couldn't get enough of it. I almost wished that I had ordered two dishes, so I could take one home for later.

If you like Italian food and are in the neighbourhood, check this place out."}
{"text":"We stopped here for appetizers before seeing the new \"Harry Potter.\"  After asking if we were waiting for a show, they were great about getting things out in a timely manner so we weren't late.

The bruschetta was standard except for the fact the bread wasn't toasted to a crisp, just thrown on the grill for a second for flavor.  It was served with fried asparagus which, of course, was delicious.  As we all know, leather could even be fried and it would taste decent.

We also opted for the fried calamari.  The batter was too light for my preference and slightly overcooked, resulting in the notorious rubber consistency.

Overall, I would have to give Prego a second try..."}
{"text":"Amazing this place has survived as long as it has in Eau Claire Mall.  Great Italian food, maybe a little pricey.  Waiter was very attentive to our needs.  It is high-end Italian but not stuffy.  Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Top notch spot. Great for a romantic date or business casual. Fine food and fairly priced! 

A place where all can enjoy a fantastic meal. 

I look forward to going again and again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 5:50 on a Thursday night.  The place was nearly empty.  We were told there was no room for my family of five.  I have no idea how the food is.  I just know they were not friendly or accommodating."}
{"text":"Delicious risotto ... I had the sausage risotto and it was delicious! In addition the service was excellent for lunch!! Very friendly and Super fast! Which is what most people needs at lunch time!! I definitely Recommend this place 100% ... I would love to go back and try other dishes, all the people on my table was happy with their meal... absolutely nothing to complain !"}
{"text":"My finance and I came to Calgary for our baby moon and we wanted Italian for supper. For the price point it was a great meal. For an appetizer, although the name escapes me, we had mozzarella wrapped prosciutto, battered and deep fried. They were excellent, not greasy, and away above standard mozzarella sticks. We shared both the risotto and gnocchi. Both were flavourful and cooked to perfection . There was so much we both had take away containers! For dessert we Jenn had creme brûlée cheesecake with berries and I had the  tiramisu. I would say they looked better than they tasted but Jenn loved the cheesecake. Service was good, but the atmosphere wasn't great. It's at the end of a mall, and a little dated. But all in all we would totally come back with bigger appetites next time!"}
{"text":"A large group of us, 8 in total, headed out to a Sex and The City 2 private viewing on a spring evening and came to Prego for a nice dinner beforehand.
 
The host seated us right away and our waiter was quick to follow to take our drink orders.  Shortly later, he arrived with our drinks and a smile.

I started with with a delicious Caprese salad which was perfect, the bocconcini cheese could have been home made, it was quite subtle but quite lovely with the dressing.  I tasted one of my friends orangini rice balls, I was sceptical at first, but they too were delicious, cheesy, crunchy, saucy, how could you go wrong? (mmm these balls were soooo moist and delicious...my friends who watch SNL will know where I am going with this ;)

I ordered the filetto pepe or, the tenderloin with prawns.  The steak was wonderfully tender and cooked just right, the prawns on top were crispy and juicy and I am not a big seafood fan and rather enjoyed them.  The sauce was indulgently creamy and perfectly spiced.  There was nothing wrong with this meal.  The veg was grilled perfectly with just the right amount of char and a nice brushing of olive oil for a delicate balance of flavours.

I finished with their cheesecake and berry compote which was so creamy and surprisingly light with just the right amount of sweet to tang ratio.  A fabulous finish to a great meal.

I didn't feel that the place was snooty or catered to business exec's but seeing how it is located in the core, you would expect that most of their clientèle would be suits.  Having said that, it didn't change the fact that the service was wonderful, food was fresh, hot and delicious and the ambiance is great.  They also threw in a mini cocktail for our pre-SATC viewing!  My only issue is they don't open on Sundays!

So impressed with this place, Officially now one of my favorites."}
