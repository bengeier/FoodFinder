{"text":"Worst food and worst service I've had here in 4 years. Cold Fries, no mayo, had to wait for beer until food was half gone. Used to love this place, now it will be a long time till we return. Waitress sent Mgr over to talk to us. Mgr said she would have comped both meals if we hadn't posted negative reviews on social media. She did comp us one meal."}
{"text":"it is a dive, in the best possible way. I don't. want to hear kareoke all the time, but after a couple frosty brews some poeple aren't half bad. Sometimes its crowded. And sometimes you own the bar, I like it either way.I keep coming back and I have yet to leave unsatisfied"}
{"text":"Boy I will say something about Simpleton's.  I visit the establishment every weekend for NFL games with a crowd.  Tonight, after the game, my date and I were refused further service.  For the simple reason that my date was abrupt with the waitress and she took point.  So, even though we are not intoxicated nor rude...we were asked to leave!   A first in my 30 + years of visiting drinking establisments.  Shame on you KIM AT SIMPLETONS for not rising above for a 15+ yr customer and not taking who he is personal.  Hmmmmm served us for another 3 hours until the other staff left then decided out while party, including new folks, were cut off.

Huge fail, since none of us were inebriated and had not only ordered their food but also bring in an entire group of football fans to spend their hard earned bucks in your establishment.

Missy is great but as soon as she left, the bartender Kim and tweeker side kick, Sonja, refused to further serve us."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with a group of twelve, I explained to our waitress that I had a prior engagement and needed to served quickly. Tina said they could do it,  I was surprized our order came on time the burger was first class the beer was cold the place was clean our bill came fast I was happy and will be back with our group next monday, Hope tina is the waitress she friendly and efficent even if there are no free beers Dan."}
{"text":"Decent place.service could be better.will give it another try sometime.my husband really liked his chz burger"}
{"text":"Typical neighborhood bar, nothing noteworthy to bring you back. Service at the bar ranges from acceptable to nonexistent - that's why my wife and I walked out after one round yesterday - we couldn't get waited on to order a second. Too many better places to go to ever come back to Simpletons."}
{"text":"I am in town for a gig happening tomorrow night and I searched a place that had karaoke and food. This place popped and I am happy it did, the staff were warm and friendly and it wasn't overly crowded. I had their clam chowder and hippie salad (chicken salad with a twist) and everything was delightful."}
{"text":"Ok, I stopped in with 2 friends last night.  I went up to the bar and ordered a pitcher of Shock Top beer.  I didn't get the bartender's name - she was thin and looked to be in late 40s or early 50s.  She wasn't real friendly but that wasn't a big deal.  I handed her a 20 and figured the pitcher of beer would be about $9-12.  This is a small bar in a strip mall in mesa, what most would consider a dive bar.  Anyway, she give me back $4.5 in change.  I tipped an additional $2 and did not get a thank you....so my pitcher of beer cost $15.5 in a dive bar in Mesa.  I finally went back up to the bar and asked if the price was correct.  She said that, yes, it is a premium pitcher and cost $15.50.  Needless to say, this is outrageous pricing and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"When the bartender knows the name of all their customers and what they drink the minute they walk in the door you know you're in one of those good  neighborhood bars. We found the wait staff very friendly to us although we were not regulars , the cheese burgers were very good and the beer was cold what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"so mis manage 45 min for a club sandwich bacon old and tasted burnt I go there a lot wantend to give them a chance with food but no excuse when cook on the phone they need a manager there then out of house wine want to charge me for premium really not my fault"}
{"text":"Staff very friendly but locals not at all..my group was booed after singing karaoke by people that frequent there .."}
{"text":"This is a followup to my 1/2 post.  We have been going here for a couple of years for Monday burger night (3 times in last 6 weeks).  This night of 1/2 was not really out of the ordinary.  Waitress seemed to favor bigger table and not overly friendly.  Happy hour ends at 6pm and we were there (2 of us) at 5:30 and the other 2 at 5:45pm.  Ordered food on split ticket at 5:50pm and got it at 6:40.  Had to flag waitress down to get another round of drinks, since she was preoccupied by bigger groups.  They charge for anything extra on the burger.  OK, bacon and cheese I understand - no problem.  They charge extra for mayonnaise of $.50.  I have been there 3 times in past month or so and EVERYtime the bill is wrong.  Sometimes in your favor, sometimes not.  This time I don't know.  The drink specials weren't posted, so I don't know what I really paid.  Food was undercharged.  Last time the drinks were overcharged.  3 of 4 ordered burgers medium.  All were well done !!  NOT pink at all, not even close.  Too bad.  The food is ok, but burgers are always well done.  Service is suspect at best and look at your bill.  We have always had a wrong amount.   Wait staff usually blame the owner.  Oh well.  We swore this is our last time there.  50 minutes to get a burger is ridiculous.  Maybe they need more staff?  It's a bar, we usually tip well if we are served quickly and correctly.  15% is my minimum and usually 20+%, even on alcohol."}
{"text":"They charge for you to be there for karaoke as if you're paying to see a band!! Hellloooo nobody cares about karaoke!! Service was ok... Except maybe the relieving bartender should lay off the drugs before coming to work"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite little neighborhood place,but not anymore. My friend and I stop in for happy hour occasionally. We were2 of maybe 5 customers in the whole place. Service was awful! Then when I went to pay, my friend said pay with cash, last time I was here they ran my card twice. So I gave her a$50,all I had. She brought me back 5 ones from a $14 tab. There is a reason no one goes there anymore. Terrible service and thieves!"}
{"text":"Great food.  We eat there on a regular basis.
I usually get their burger and it's good every time.
Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Deal was $10.00 fish and chips on the front of the menu.  All the fish you can eat and it came with a French fries.  The menu also stated soup or salad and they didn't change the menu saying they don't offer that deal anymore and would not honor it.  Poor policy since we asked about it, won't go back now.  Plus fish needs some seasoning but still tasted good."}
{"text":"LIL MISTY is a fantastic bartender with a fun attitude! We enjoyed some karaoke and killer all you can eat tacos!"}
{"text":"Service is always pretty sub-par. Tonight, waitress messed up our drink order, not a big deal, but when I told her the order was wrong she just shrugged her shoulders at me. I assumed she was going to bring me the drink I ordered, I was wrong. Place is a joke."}
{"text":"We were invited here by some friends on Saturday night to celebrate another friend's birthday.  It's been a couple years since my last visit to Simpleton's but one thing that I remember was their burgers and fries.  In fact, a couple of us have since referred to the burgers as \"BABs\" (big a** burgers).   That's the first thing we ordered and I wasn't disappointed.  The burgers are big, juicy and tasty.  The large portion of fries on the side hit the spot too.

I'd say that Simpleton's lives up to its name.  It's a small bar, not too fancy and no frills but the food I've tried is good and priced right.  If you're thirsting for draft beer, they have domestic pitchers for just $7.   However, if you're looking for a bar that mixes quality specialty drink or shots, this probably isn't your place.  We ordered \"Washington Apples\" - they ended up being really watery and overpriced.  I'd go back for a BAB though!"}
{"text":"Great dive bar. Spacious. Lots of locals. Our waitress was slow and not knowledgeable but she was nice. I am actually closer to a 4.5 on this one. Food was good, hearty."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that it's almost literally a hole in the wall, and I'm consistently younger than everyone by 40 years, it has pretty good food. Also, if you happen to luck out and get Melisa (Meh-Lisa) as your waitress, then you'll be set. She kicks ass! However, there is a blond waitress (Missy?) who is absolutely terrible and pays no attention. If you get her you should probably just walk out. Tasty otherwise!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Thursday night for Karaoke. It was moderately busy when we arrived with a couple of large groups. We seated ourselves and waited a little bit before our waitress came to greet us. We ordered our drinks and they were brought out in a timely manner. The menu is filled with typical bar food selections and many other yummy offers. The food is very good. We ordered the honey bbq wings. They were very good. The decor is modern divey. There is Karaoke Tuesday, Thursday Friday and Saturday. The noise level can get loud depending on the type of music being sung/played and how busy it is. This place is A-ok in my book and we will be back."}
{"text":"Was with a group of people! Half our group was done eating before I even saw my salad, yes a salad. I was three bites in and found a hair! I'm so grossed out?"}
{"text":"I have been sitting in this establishment for 30 minutes. I used to work in the same plaza and have never had service like this, well im getting no service so maybe I shouldnt compare. I came here a year ago with a friend with crazy tattoos and was treated horribly too. I saw both bartenders talk about me and then go to every table but mine. Maybe I need an oxygen tank or handlebar mustache to get a menu here. This is ridiculous,  no wonder this shit hole has 3 tables full and thats even a surprise to me. Too bad I have a party of 10 coming that im now telling to go down the street to jj Madisons for karaoke."}
{"text":"Typical dive bar. I noticed if you're not a \"regular\" there then they won't look your way. They're simply there to collect a paycheck and whatever tips they can get, which even then they have no sense of urgency. 

They are all over the place and because of their unorganization, they forget you've been standing there waiting to order a drink. 

The food is so-so, nothing special, though fairly priced. If you go solely for Karaoke on Saturday nights expect to sing 1-2 songs, 3 if you're lucky. The rotation is too long to work it's way back around. 

I ordered a beer on tap, the glass smelled of Clorox Bleach and tasted old. Made me feel sick to my stomach. They need to call 'Bar Rescue' or something.

When it comes to mixed drinks they are overpowering. For alcoholics this may not seem like an issue, but for those who are social, occasional drinkers who want a  nice, fruity tasteful drink..forget about it. They guesstimate the outpouring. The decor is \"weird\" to say the least. Old Westerny Theme could sum it up. It's DEFINITELY NOT for the Younger scene. 

If you're looking to play darts, don't waste your time. The darts don't stick and are broken. Pathetic. They just take up room. I'm not being rude, or exaggerating my review in any way. Just giving my dead-honest perception and opinion."}
{"text":"November 2015

I went with a few people who are frequent flyers of this place.  The waitress was friendly, quick to refill orders, and took the time to chat it up for a bit.  The food was the quintessential bar food you get any \"dive\" bars - so don't expect much.  I got the Pollo Arizona which come on a potato hamburger bun, grilled chicken, one slice of melted Monterrey jack cheese, a tablespoon of green chilis, 2 tomato slices, a large leaf of lettuce, and mayo.  Not sure why it is called that, since it's not very southwestern.  I wish there was a southwestern sauce, or something to add spice/flavor to it.  The side salad was good, but the Italian dressing seemed watered down.  There is shuffleboard, darts, and TVs galore."}
{"text":"I have been supporting this bar and the owners other bars for many years...when I come here I am relieved to see Tina and Summer they are two kick ass workers that get the job done, unfortunately their hands are tied when it comes to getting your drinks or tabbing you out because they have to wait on the bartender and if it is Misty then you will be waiting a while when she decides to do it on her time. I have never known a bar to charge for karaoke especially when the group you are with are spending money on alcohol...unfortunately the patrons will see this become disgusted and take it off what would be the waitress tip (which is NOT FAIR) to the waitresses who do bust their asses and live off their tips...no patron should have to contribute to helping the bar pay for entertainment that is supposedly bringing in patrons to spend money in the bar!!!! I think \"Maestro\" is awesome very personable and does an excellent job also is a crowd pleaser with his personality and participation in karaoke...Thank you Matt, Tina and Summer you 3 are AWESOME...
I truly miss Sheila running karaoke!! She sincerely cared about the sound and each singer. Karaoke at Simpletons now is way to loud and earpiercing and the host does not take the time to adjust each singer to make them sound better and doesn't do anything to prevent microphone feedback it is OBNOXIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"The BEST all-you-can-eat fish fry. Every order came out freshly cooked unlike other restaurants that cook ahead. Some of the other people at our table ordered other meals and they were delicious, filling, and worth the price. The waitress, Misty, was awesome. We never went without a drink refill or more fish and she even laughed at our horrible jokes. Come early because there was a line outside the door and for good reason."}
{"text":"You know, this place is a sweet and sour experience... when Tina is working tables and Denise is behind the bar, service is great and friendly. When Sonya or Misty are working, the demeanor and service drop dramatically... if you're not part of the right clique, you're screwed.

Appetizers are mostly overpriced for what is marginally a neighborhood dive. This isn't Tilted Kilt, but it is priced like it was. The food is usually good, as long as you steer clear of the cheese crisps - Taco Bell across the parking lot does better.

If you're into beer, this isn't the place to go - about the best beer they have in rack is Fat Tire. Mass-market domestic swill rules here. For liquor, Makers Mark is the best bourbon & forget about single malt Scotch whisky - they don't have any. In other words, you're not going to impress anyone with your taste in spirits coming here. This is the kind of place where they think Jack & Crown Royal are premium selections - and they charge premium prices for the privilege of drinking the stuff of alcoholics... I've begged them to bring in some Four Roses or Macallan - nope... mostly rotgut bottles. I guess if I wanted better booze, I could go to a classier place like Buffalo Wild Wings or Native New Yorker (this place is that far down the list.) I think the Hambone might have a better selection of things to imbibe in and that is sad. A far better experience for karaoke fans or hungry folk would be Old Chicago (Alma School & US60) on Sunday evenings with their $2.50 pints of anything in the rack.

Depending on who is behind the bar, you might have to wait an hour for your tab because the servers aren't supposed to be back there tallying up checks and the bartender might have her sights set on some old fart at the bar. Begging to pay your tab isn't fun, if you know what I mean.

By the way - if you pay with plastic, this place charges a surcharge - something that if people complain about will cost them their ability to take plastic - surcharges & service charges are an express no-no with Visa, MasterCard & Amex credit cards. Complain to your card issuer.

Sometimes I wonder why I go back - but the karaoke is fun (Maestro is the only staff member who usually sings - he is a crowd favorite & you'll love him) and some of the people in there are great - customers & staff. Again, not all the staff is competent and, typical of any karaoke bar, some of the singers think they will be discovered any day now. 

By the way - some of the five star reviews are from Simpleton's staff - they think the place rocks, or something like that.

If Denise & Tina leave, I'll find somewhere else to hang out - there are much better options in Mesa & elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great staff! Cozy atmosphere. Awesome prices! Some real talent on karaoke nights. Been coming here since 1995. They make you feel like family. Food is good and prices are very reasonable! It's tucked in the corner of frys plaza next to Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Came back here after almost 3 years. The food is still good, the service has improved, the karaoke is still great. We'll return periodically to see if this holds true."}
{"text":"Came for karaoke. Did not know about the one drink minimum. My friend asked for a water. Server told her she would could charge for the same price as a soda. My friend doesn't drink alcohol and can't have carbonation. So she end up getting a lemonade. But the server sure got testy about debating the legalities of charging for water in Arizona. 
I will add she was very nice to me.
Saturday Night. Karaoke DJ Definitely has his favorite patrons. 
My $6 Dr Pepper seems to have the proper carbonation to syrup ratio that was a plus. Perhaps if had filled my gullet with alcohol I would have been able to see the place with drunk eyes and enjoyed it. But alas, I don't drink."}
