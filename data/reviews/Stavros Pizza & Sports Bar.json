{"text":"My rating for Stavros isn't for the food or the decor, but for it's value and atmosphere. If you're looking for a nice dinner out or a hip pub, then skip Stavros. But if you're in the mood for a pitcher of beer, good deals on food, and pool, then you're at the right place. I personally love a good, kinda grungy bar, and so Stavros is great.

They have great specials, like half price pizza  and FREE POOL on Sundays (and it's yummy pizza) and daily specials such as $5.95 for a steak sandwich. Also, they serve pork dumplings which, though not made in house, are certainly darned delicious.

Basically, it's a solid neighbourhood bar with decent food at afforadble prices."}
{"text":"Great, clean neighbourhood pub. Good food. Great and attentive wait staff. All around great experience! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is usually to die for, though we did have a bad one once that tasted like oven cleaner and we called to let them know but did not receive a response. 

Eating in, service is spotty but usually great, they might need some more servers, or maybe some different ones, owner is AWESOME and so are the regulars :) 

Tips: Ask for meat sauce instead of pizza sauce it is GREAT!"}
{"text":"I just did takeout at the nearest pizzeria and Stavros it was. I'd never stepped foot in it before and wasn't sure what to expect. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't find their pizza menu online, but thought I'd trust the reviews. 

The staff is friendly and has a good neighbourhood pub feel to it, with what appeared to be at least a few regulars. I ordered three pizzas and a beer for the wait. A very decent price for a pint on a Friday evening. 

I ordered the donair, meat lovers and a chicken pizza with a fancy name that I don't remember. Anyways, the meat lovers is very good, and while I don't particularly like donair pizzas at any time myself, the others did. The chicken one was fine also, but I was expecting something a little more unique. Top marks for the crust, just the right thickness, and terrific flavours to support the toppings flavours. 

The key comment to me when I read reviews is would I bother with a return visit? It's a little out of the way for us, but I would still say yes!"}
{"text":"For a neighborhood pub the food is outstanding. Service is always great. Sta
ff is always friendly. Highly recommend it. I heard the owners are doing renos soon so better yet. Great job guys. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Great food for delivery or pick up. Also, a great place to watch the game or play a game of pool. I highly recommend the pizza!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in city by far Staff very good"}
{"text":"Solid pizza. Delicious, and nice thick crust. We asked for extra sauce, as per other reviews here. Sauce was spicy and flavourful. We were here on a Sunday, which means 1/2 price pizzas eaten in house. We ordered 2 medium (10\") pizzas: the San Andreas (chicken, olives, sun dried tomatoes, onion) and #5 (pepperoni, tomato & green bell pepper). Both are worth getting again. 
The beer selection isn't great, but has 10 (standards, including Bud, grasshopper, stella, steam whistle, etc.) on tap. Service is slightly slow, but feels relaxed and comfortable.
The restaurant, in spite it being tucked inside a strip mall, has an old-fashioned sports bar vibe, and I appreciate the effort."}
{"text":"We came in on Tuesday as we were craving pizza and it was also the Flames playing Montreal. I had not been in for about a year and a half, and was absolutely \"Wowed\" by the changes. They have renovated. Gone are the hideous, uncomforable chairs, replaced instead by lovely black leather seats that make you want to kick back and stay a while. Our pizza did take a while to come out (about an hour!), but it was well worth the wait and our server was amazing in the meantime. It was also wing night, 25 cents each (not sure if that was because it was Tuesday or Flames game night) but the platters of big, juicy looking wings going past our table were utterly mouthwatering. I will go back again for the pizza that is always tasty and delicious, as well as to try some of those wing night offerings. I found the new decor very pleasing, and also you cannot find a bad seat in the house to watch multiple games (the audio was the Flames game). My only two complaints were the one hour pizza and the 60's/early 70's classic rock played after the game, but it may be what others are wanting. I don't know what I expected to hear, it was just a little \"golden oldies\" rock for me."}
{"text":"The pizza here is hands down some of the best in the city. The old school kind of pizza with a great crust and sauce. This pub is tucked into a strip mall in the NW community of Ranchlands.

The pub is a bit dated and is your typical pub with TV's and pool tables. Service is good for eat in as well as take out. Pricing is reasonable and they always have specials on food items.

Been coming here for years and will continue doing so when I crave classic pizza."}
{"text":"One of the beat Pizza in town 
Just dont like ordering a Large and getting a medium
We measured the box next to Pango and the large panago is larger 
So your paying same price for a large and getting a 
Medium 

But still a really good Pizza"}
{"text":"As a recent re-transplant to Calgary from Vancouver, I was missing my favorite, long-time family-run pizza place in Vancouver so my boyfriend introduced me to Stavros. Came on a Sunday night when they have an in-house only deal on pizza. There's just something about this place that is so inviting from the time you walk in the door - from the smell of home-cooking to the friendly staff chatting up the regulars, you feel welcome here. Then there's the pizza - OH MY GOD! Soooo good. Don't know what they put in their pizza sauce but that combined with their perfect crust will have you inhaling pizza so fast, you might forget to chew. Couldn't help but become somewhat of a regular myself. It's that good here."}
{"text":"Stavro's is the first sports bar I think I've ever set foot in. I fell in love with their pizza back in my childhood days and 20 years later with my new \"adult\" taste, I still think their pizza's are pretty great!  Thick crust. Tonnes of cheese. Loaded with toppings. This is Canadian pub pizza at its best. 

Nothings really changed. Still awesome pizza in a somewhat divey sports bar atmosphere with a couple pool tables and a few regulars hanging around the bar. Definitely a place I would consider for a neighbourhood pint with a friend or two when I'm in the area. 

Definitely not a \"happening\" place, but the pizza is worth while and the staff have always been super friendly."}
{"text":"REALLY great staff and AMAZING pizza !!!  Gosh its just a great place !! I look forward to coming back soon.  I have been there a few times and its always great :) I love this place !!!  A nice atmosphere and nice people that come here too !"}
{"text":"I go to Stavros for the pizza. I love the taste but do recommend ordering extra sauce. It's very close to the pizza I grew up with back in Saint Lambert, Quebec. The only objection though is that the crust could be a bit thinner, not thin crust though, just medium,  if they changed that, it would be perfect."}
{"text":"This is one of my picks for Crowfoot area *thick* crust pizza when I'm home and in that mood (which happens sometimes but not a lot).  I always recommend ordering extra sauce because that's where a lot of the flavor is.  It's a disappointing pizza day when the kitchen skimps on the sauce.  My sister will even order a side of sauce to make sure she gets enough - but I can't handle sauce on top so I take my chances on the extra sauce being enough

Of the veggie options,  I'm partial to the greek pizza as I find the veggie as is on the menu to be a tad bland (extra toppings for more spunk is an option - but the lazy option is pick the greek).  I like the crust - I will even eat the ends (not always the case with thick crusts).   Dining companions that eat meat swear by the cheeseburger pizza.  

The most economic way to order this pizza on any average day is to order take out.  They offer BOGOHO (is that an accepted acronym? ha!)  aka buy one and get one half off.  

You basically get 2 mediums for just over $20 or 2 larges for about $30.  Overall it's decent food for reasonable money and it's better than large chains.   Food is usually ready in 30 minutes so the turn around is good.

The actual sports bar is not really my crowd so I haven't spent much time there personally - only stopping in to take out.

{"text":"Love Stavros. I have been going to this pub for a few years now and have got to know the owners and the staff really well. They are all awesome and always a pleasure to be around. The pizza here is hands down some of the best in the city. It is half price on Sundays -  amazing. There is live music on the weekends, which is normally really good, and in general always a really fun crowd. Breakfast is also always killer."}
{"text":"Great local bar. Nice for a drink but also has some good pub grub. Pizza is great. Lots of TV'S for watching sports and they usually have good deals during games. Only complaint is there lack of draft beer selection. It would be great if they added some local beers to their selection."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop here coming home late from work last evening. We were pleased that it wasn't busy because we were both pretty hungry. 

We sat down and waited and waited and waited. After about 5 minutes I started to time our wait. There was a girl behind the bar talking to a couple then talking on the phone then talking to the couple at the bar again. I started to have some hope when a second server came out. Unfortunately she walked right by us and went behind the bar to get something to drink. 

After a timed five minutes we decided to leave. I just couldn't leave without voicing my displeasure. Both servers offered feeble excuses and I just thanked them for their stellar service. 

Don't know what they would have done if it was busy.

So long Stavros. Hello Stonewall Pub"}
