{"text":"I normally do not write reviews for restaurants but after our experience, I even signed up for an account just so I could. My friend and I ate there for lunch this week, the food was decent but sooooo pricey for what it was. The place looks cool and modern for a vietnamese restaurant but the service was completely ghetto. We expected at the prices they were charging that the service would be more attentive. One girl kept smiling at least but she was on her phone half the time texting. It didn't feel like a high end service experience even with the higher end prices. They never checked on us and when my friend asked for a refill of water, it seemed she was putting the server out. We left feeling really let down. It's really too bad because you can buy cheaper and better vietnamese food at the small pho shops where at least your not paying a premium for the service."}
{"text":"Four of us had lunch here yesterday. Two of us had an 8 hour layover at the airport. It's around the back of the airport and takes about 15 minutes to get there from T3.  Not busy at lunch time. The friendly server seated us immediately and served us green tea with the menus. It's not tapas style at lunch time. I had the pho with rare beef (P1, $8.50). Served with a side plate of fresh bean sprouts, basil and hot peppers. Also tasted the Flank &shrimp Tom yum soup (BN7, $9.). Both were delicious with a well seasoned broth and lots of beef (and shrimp in BN7). I'm just back from Vietnam and was disappointed with the food. I think we have better Vietnamese food in Canada and Dang! Is a good example."}
{"text":"Nice quite restaurant. Service was great. Food was very good. Definitely on my favorite list."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, great food.  Greeted by very friendly staff. Some in my party had never experienced Vietnamese food. Server took a great deal of time explaining things. Never a hint of impatience.  Lots of food. We left full.   Will go back again soon."}
{"text":"My family and I came here at Sunday night for dinner. We all had Pho and plenty of tapas dishes like beef dishes (Bo Tai Me, Bo Tai Thui, Bo luc Lac), pork dishes (Ruoc Heo chien & nuong) jelly fish, and escargot. We enjoyed them all! They kept all of their recipes original and with slight modifications, flavours stand out even more. My Vietnamese parents got to try food they haven't had in a long time and their selection is not something you will find in a typical Pho restaurant.   Their ambience is great and the service was very nice, maybe they wanted to really impress my traditional parents? We loved their tea too, you can tell it wasn't a cheap tea that you would have at a Pho or Dimsum place like I had that morning (haha)  Only reason I'm giving 4 stars... Their Pho was a nice, generous portion but its Southern Vietnam style and I'm from the North. It's not for me but my fianc√© liked it.   Overall great food, service and reasonable prices. Will be back to try their rice, vermicilli and other tapas."}
{"text":"There's so many things to recommend from their menu!  Great environment and service. Would definitely come back for their beef cubes and conch.  Glad this place is finally opened"}
{"text":"An interesting little place in the remote regions of Mississauga.  I was excited to see what kind of Viet Tapas they had to offer.  I loves me some dim-sum and tapas, so I figured this should be right up my ally.  It's a little bit pricey as is all places in North America that say they offer \"Tapas\" style food.    The food was okay overall, and it's a nice alternative to just Pho, especially for the area.  It's definitely got the mom and pop shop type charms and all that goes with it."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. The concept of Viet tapas is interesting and I'm surprised that there aren't more places that specialize in this, now to think about it. Viet tapas make sense, though many place do have the same items on their menu displayed as appetizers but seldom are there many places that focus on making food that so many of us enjoy (especially over drinks). Now with that being said, I love the concept but not necessarily the execution.  DANG! Is a decent sized restaurant on a main street of Industrial Mississauga; not necessarily out of place but I can't see many people travelling into this area in search of bar-esque food. We came across this place on a whim and decided to dine-in to satisfy out curiosity. I can't say I was overly impressed as I grew up with food (especially drinking snacks as such).   We ordered a veggie stir-fried noodles, a viet-style beef carpaccio, and an order of chicken wings. Ample of warnings...portions are small...to be fair, I should've known since the word TAPAs was printed on their name (my folly). The noodle stir-fry was good. The flavour was there, but to my personal preference I usually do not like that particular noodle. However looking passed that, the flavour was a little smokey and had dimension, veggies cooked to the right consistency. I had no complaints about the dish and did enjoy it for the most part.   Moving on to the beef. Normally, one of my all-time favourite comfort food; it a simple dish...raw thin beef slices marinated in a mixture of vinegar and sugar with a splash of fish sauce, garnished with a heap of thinly sliced onions and herbs and topped crispy fried onions/garlic/peanuts. Simple, fresh, and oh-so satisfying. I could not say the same for this item on their menu. The marinate lacked the strong and balanced taste profile and I had to ask a couple of time for extra lime to compensate for the much needed acidity. The dish was heavy with fillers like lettuce. I was not impressed or satisfied.  The wings were edible. Nothing really to write about or memorable. Typical dry fried chicken wings. However, the price was definitely not justified.         The one aspect that got me excited was their playlist, playing all my childhood pop hit. The restaurant is clean and not too busy. Service was friendly. I probably won't be coming back, mainly because it's everything I could muster up at home. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants a quick non-threatening intro to viet drinking snacks at its most basic. Otherwise, go to other viet restaurants and grab an app, or a sub/snacks place which most likely they would be able to provide some interesting choices."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a unique Vietnamese restaurant that delivers food with a homemade feel, this is the place to be.   Unlike your traditional pho restaurant, this restantant and lounge offers a wide selection of tapas. I was recommended the conch and scallops, both of which were very flavorful. The conch is a signature dish and is one that the chef has been making for over 10 years. Be sure to drink the soup that is in the conch shell as well to really experience all the flavour of the shellfish!   The decor is very modern, and staff are very friendly. There is a stage for local artists, which the waiter mentioned they used for events and karaoke night.  Would definitely recommend to friends and family, and I will definitely be coming back myself."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch today with a coworker. The reviews looked great and was excited to try this new place out but was extremely disappointed. I'm Vietnamese so am very familiar with Vietnamese cuisine and pho restaurants. All their pho's are the same price and one size only. To add a meat is an addition of $3. I wanted chicken and beef balls but didn't want to pay $12 for a bowl of pho that is usually $7-8. The waiter suggested the beef noodle soup special (pho dac biet) and he told me they mix everything from beef, beef balls in it and it included chicken as well. I thought that was weird and said usually it is all beef items and that pho Dac  biet doesn't ever mix chicken into it but sure I'll take that! He came back shortly and said \"we use to put chicken in it and don't anymore\". My coworker ordered beef with rice and he brought out a chicken with rice. He apologized and said he punched it in wrong. The girl that seemed to be in charge came and dropped the rice with beef without a word or apology. Usually a mixed fish sauce accompanies the rice for you to pour on the rice.. when we asked our server he directed us to the straight up fish sauce that is kept on the table. Wasn't too impressed with the flavour of anything either. Pho broth is too strong in 5 spice. Also have never been to a place and had pho where they don't give you a small bowl to put the hoisin and sriracha sauce in. I used a spoon to dip my meat in. Probably will never return for their lunch or the service and unfamiliarity with their own menu items."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. Menu looked very promising on paper but didn't quite deliver in terms of flavour. Dang is a restaurant by day and a viet tapas/bar by night. Dark decor, dim lighting, loud music (Edm remixes of top 40s songs). Not sure if this is the same vibe during the day. They're trying to attract a younger crowd. Except when I went at 9pm on a Friday night.. It was empty. There were only 3 tables including us. So the service was attentive.. But you also see the two wait staff standing at the bar playing on their phones.   We ordered: - Bo luc Lac (shaken beef) - comes on a small sizzling plate w/ onions... No wow factor in terms of flavour.. Just oily.  - beef tataki - this was very hard to eat as the wasabi sauce drizzled all over the plate was too overpowering to the point where it feels like you got punched in the nose... And then tears erupted from the corner of your eyes... This happened w/ each bite. - fish sauce chicken wings - 5 or 7 very small, skinny, fried pieces of chicken wings in fish sauce. I've had better (go to cafe Pho nho to try). The sauce was good... But it wasn't the right consistency and it didn't bind well enough to the wings. You taste more of the oil and batter than you do of the sauce.  -  lotus stem salad - it had the right ingredients... But there was a clash of flavour in this dish. The fish sauce dressing was good but could use more heat . It went well with all the veggies except when you bit into the the actual lotus stem. The lotus stems are pickled from a jar.. And you can taste the juice it was pickled in.. Which was different from the fish sauce dressing. Maybe this is because the stems are quite thick. Maybe the lotus stems need to be shredded a bit thinner to blend and absorb the other flavours better. (try this salad at ilovepho and taste the difference)  - scallops - 5 scallops dressed in hoisin, oil, fried green onion and peanuts. It was still attached to the joint, so you have to detach it yourself first and then slurp everything down. Tasted ok.   Overall, wasn't impressed by the dishes I ordered in terms of flavour - missing the wow factor. I've had better elsewhere, For bigger portions and same price or cheaper. But I also haven't tried everything else. Would have to come back w a larger group to be able to try everything else on the menu. But if I wasn't impressed by the 5 dishes I ordered.. Chances are I would probably feel the same about the other items on the menu. But if you wanted to have late night drinks and eat viet appetizers (mon nhau) w a group of friends it would be an ok place to go to."}
{"text":"Dang Vietnamese Tapas is a new up and coming in Mississauga. It's a family owned business that is has the perfect amount of menu items for tapas, and dinner. I went with a few friends and we decided we would order one of everything from the tapas menu, there were 6 of us and it all came up to about $30 each. I wouldn't say I was full because it was tapas, and then again it's bulking season.   The venue had a great ambiance, and they are not even done decorating. I especially loved their red painted ceilings above the chandelier. It's a very artistic piece! The top 3 dishes in my opinion were the Chicken Lollies at #1, Pork Chitlins at #2, and the Beef Carpaccio at #3. But don't let me make your decisions, try it out for yourself. I think you will be satisfied with your visit. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"had P4 pho here after a long period flight from US. not too many restaurants are still open after 10pm and very glad to see that this one is close to the airport and open till 1. They have a big screen to show some music vedio. like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"DANG! is a really fun tapas lounge bar and has amazing food. Like with all tapas, it can get costly real fast. The fried chicken wings (the one shaped as a ball) and the sizzling beef were my absolute favs! The scallop and goi salad were also really yummy. I recommend them all.   We went on a sat evening and it was totally empty. Were were the only people in the whole resto. I wished there were more people there. Not sure if its the area they are located in or just being new.   Overall, I loved my experience there because the wait staff were very friendly. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was lit and for all those reasons 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Dang! Is dang good. I had a great experience today. Very nice staffs and very friendly. I had the shaking beef, scallops and pork chitlins, It was amazing! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience coming here. The food was amazing and the staff were super friendly and always tried to make sure that we were enjoying our experience. Have been going back multiple times since the beginning of the soft opening. Recommend the shaking beef, sake conch (when available), beef carpaccio, and definitely the scallops and pho!! Definitely a good place to hang out with friends for good food and drinks!!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and noticed that a new Vietnamese restaurant is opening soon. I went to check it out during their soft opening and I was pleasantly surprised by their decor. I came at lunch time and got their pho (beef noodle soup) and it was probably the best I've ever had (and I've been to a lot of places!). The bowl nice nice and steaming with such an aromatic broth to die for. The bill came out for pretty cheap too even before the 15% soft opening discount.   The courteous server (Annie?) told us that they have a special Vietnamese Tapas menu for dinner only so that intrigued me. I went the next day for dinner and tried like 4-5 of their tapas dishes and it was amazing! The Shaking beef was very tender, the scallops were fresh and perfectly grilled, beef carpaccio was very unique and the lotus stem salad was very refreshing and flavourful.   I definitely recommend this place to everyone! I haven't seen a restaurant in the GTA that serves food like that. 5/5 for great service, amazing food, and nice/clean decor."}
{"text":"Food: Shaking beef dinner: 5 stars Cured sausage: 3 stars Steamed snails: 3 stars Scallops: 4 stars Green papaya beef jerkey: 2.5 stars  I was pleasantly surprised with how incredibly tender the AAA sirloin was! I would say this is a must try. They have a nice sauce that is drizzled over the rice but not in excessive amounts. They have more sauce in a separate dish for you to add to your liking.  I'm not a fan of the spongey consistency of the cured sausage but it was OK overall. I don't think it's meant to be spicy but one of my friends are one piece that turned out to be very spicy...mystery remains unsolved.  The steamed snails are quite big compared to your standard fare escargot. They're not covered in any sauce and since they're so large, it's a little more detailed...kind of had to just shove it in my mouth and chew without thinking about it too much. It was very meaty and had a nice simple salty taste. It was ever so slightly slimy (less than okra).  Scallops were very nice and I think it goes well with the green onion but I'm not a fan of any kind of onions so I'm biased. Juicy and flavorful overall.  The green papaya beef jerkey was meh. The soy jus in the salad had a salty chili flavour to it; it went well with the green papaya. The beef jerkey was too hard though and overall, this tapas didn't really do it for me.   Ambiance: 4 stars Very chic, dark interior. Nice spacious bar/lounge area. Each table had a real lit candle. Sofa seats lining the wall. Located in a commercial strip plaza next to Esso.   Service: 4 stars Maybe because it was a Sunday evening and this place is still fairly new, we were essentially the only customers for our entire stay. Service was therefore quick and attentive. Our waitress was nice and brought everything we needed/asked for."}
{"text":"Dang! is located in an industrial area in Mississauga, an out of place mini-plaza. I think it would do better if it was located near Square One.   It's an interesting concept of tapas and Vietnamese comfort food like pho noodle soup and vermicelli.   The decor appears like it used to be a Caucasian pub place as it already has a bar area which is non-existent in a traditional viet place. A bit dark to my liking too. However, the washroom was modern and clean compare to some older viet restaurants.   We both ordered grilled chicken vermicelli. My partner added a spring roll for $1 and it was small. Not worth the buck!! The presentation is better than usual, a bit smaller portion, but the chicken was grilled right, had plenty of veggies and the noodles were thin and not sticking to each other. We also had the green papaya with beef jerky as an appetizer from their tapas menu. The sauce was flavourful and the green papaya was shredded as you would expect. A bit more of beef jerky would have been nice.   For a Friday night dinner, the place was quiet empty.   Verdict: I would go back only if I was in the area. I still like Pho 99 (the three that are around Mississauga) for comfort yummy food."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  The scallops (but be aware of the sand in scallops) and the chicken wings in the sweet chili Thai sauce.   The tapas menu has a lot of options, however the food from that menu is mediocre at best. The fried food don't hv much taste to it. The papaya salad with jerk beef was ok. The green bean mochi did not taste good (don't order that!).   LAST TIP?!  I recommend not ordering from their tapas menu, rather order from the viet menu for soup noodles, pho or other traditional viet food like other restaurants. The tapas menu is simply not the best place to go to for food."}
