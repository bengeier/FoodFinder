{"text":"This place is surprisingly great!!  We live in the neighbourhood and thought we'd give it a try.  Excellent sushi, maki, sashimi - extra little touches (had tastes of different dishes on the house between dishes we ordered).  Everything is super fresh and the 'contemporary rolls' we tried were excellent!!  Innovative menu and the traditional dishes are most excellent!  Good ambience, excellent service.  This will be a regular for us!!"}
{"text":"My review is based on takeout, so perhaps in-house dining experience is better, but I have to say that I won't be going back to find out.

Basics such as chicken udon soup and chicken teriyaki bento were \"meh\" at best, and one of their \"contemporary rolls\" (the \"New York\") was mushy -- and didn't seem to match what was on the menu. I suspect the mush-factor kicked in as a result of takeout, but still, it was disappointing.

And, as with so many St. Clair West restaurants, the place was completely empty on a Saturday night. While I hope they do well, I wasn't impressed enough to return. I give them four to six months at best."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sushi always tastes fresh and the service always comes with a smile. No complaints."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Friday, and there were a few people in there. 

Pros: great cheap lunch specials, beautiful decor and those private booths, excellent tasting avocado in their rolls, and good wakame (seaweed) salad.

Cons: service is slow (though perfectly nice).

Go there for a relaxed lunch or dinner and I don't think you'll regret it. And it's the only sushi game in that area!"}
{"text":"We read the menu and prices posted outside the window before going in. So we knew what we were getting ourselves into, price wise.

The restaurant was pricey as any sushi joint in the city but the quantity of food was lacking. The amount of rice, yes rice was very minimal. As well the amount of Wasabi per plate was the smallest we've ever seen. 

Anyways it s kinda of a disappointment when any place becomes reserved at serving the cheapest stuff on their menu. Like Rice and Wasabi. 

Posting this as a heads up, I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I have to say that I've been here twice and I'm a fan of this place.

We were greeted by the happiest server I've ever met and have the choice between tables and a private booth.

The menu went from simple lunch bentos to more intricate lobster rolls and the New York roll topped with red tuna. 

The sashimi was of excellent quality...far better than you would think from a Japanese restaurant situated in the heart of Corso Italia.

A hidden gem that is a perfect balance of value for quality."}
{"text":"When we moved to the corso italia area we didn't expect there'd be a solid neighborhood sushi place.    We're now big fans, particularly of the generously-sized `small' sashimi dinner, and the kamakaze rolls.   

Some of their contemporary rolls are pretty great, but some are a bit far out for me; processed cheese on the volcano roll?"}
{"text":"I like the people that work here. I get vegetarian sushi (and it's pretty good). I come here often because we live in the neighbourhood. I'm definitely happy it's here and would recommend the place to friends - just don't expect the best sushi ever. Expect OK sushi that does the trick."}
