{"text":"After reading some rave reviews we decided to have brunch with a couple of friends. We had a short wait in line (about 20 minutes or so) and had a great meal.  The food was delish and the coffee was enjoyed by all at our table.  Our servers were wonderful and attentive enough without too much hovering.  We found that the portions were just right and I was impressed by the fact that they source much of their menu locally and the coffee was fair trade.  We were all in agreement that this spot was a must return experience."}
{"text":"YUM! Holy moly...sooo good. Fresh food, have been twice different items on the menu each time. Everything I have tried panini and salad were super delicious and the people I went with all agreed. I have been to Holy Grill down the street which is also good- but their food is a little heavy for me...Monki is spot on."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Monki for a birthday breakfast.  The place is pretty small. It happened to be a pretty rainy day so the line up wasn't too bad.   We shared a panini sandwich and had the Nutella/condensed milk french toast. The meal was delish! The service was great. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is delicious, but the place is small so it ends up being an event. When the weather is nice I like to put in my name for a table and head across the street to browse the aisles at community. When I come back to Monki I'll grab a coffee and chat outside with friends until our table is ready. If you get there after 9:30am on the weekend you can end up waiting from 1-2 hours to get a seat for more than 2 people. I don't mind that, it is worth it. I would just really like to go more often :)  I really like their grapefruit brule and they serve homemade jam. Every flavour of their jam that I've had has been a wonderful and unique flavour. I wish they sold their jam. They serve local products like spolumbos sausage. Great coffee (fratello), great service. Atmosphere is top notch. Such a lovely space. Only wish is that this place was a bit bigger."}
{"text":"Their burgers are incredible, other dishes are good too, but it's hard to resist that pretzel bun, bacon, and egg."}
{"text":"Appalling. Ordered the \"bowl\" with lemongrass and coconut broth and added 2 poached eggs to it. I was not prepared for a measly few cups of broth and a pinch of sprouts...for $19!?!?!?! Are you kidding me??? It only came with 1 of the 2 eggs requested. The broth was bland and it tasted like someone's first time trying to cook with coconut milk..  My partner ordered the brisket skillet and it came with two poached eggs on top.  I informed the waitress not to charge me for the egg I didn't receive and she replied \"oh they added it to the other dish instead I guess.\" She took it off the bill. She didn't offer to fix my meal or get me the egg I requested...Also did not appreciate being asked \"would you like fruit?\" and not being told that you get 4 tiny slices of fruit for $5. Total rip-off.  The bill was over $53 for two coffees and two tiny breakfasts. I have no problem paying for quality but the flavors do not match up to the hype. I still feel dumbstruck how a few cups of broth cost me $20. The only reason this place isn't one star is because the coffee was good."}
{"text":"There are just so many good things I'd like to say about this place. The food is delicious, the staff is great and the place is cute! I had the grape fruit burl√® and it was amazing!!! A must try!!"}
{"text":"Monki is an amazing Calgary find! Tucked away on quite 10 ave downtown, it offers a great atmosphere with amazing food. I know this place will fast become my favorite because I had trouble deciding what to order - I loved it all! But I've been on a mac and cheese hunt around the city so I settled on the lobster jalapeno mac and cheese. It was everything I wanted it to be - you must get it.   I am looking forward to heading back for breakfast to try the benedicts or a frittatas. Yum!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and go here! Best brunch in Calgary. Worth the long wait. Great coffee, amazing food, friendly service and good atmosphere. Get the hash."}
{"text":"This place scores maximum on all levels! Relaxed, warm atmosphere with good music, very friendly staff and mouth watering delicious meals!  I couldn't stop talking about that place after my brunch outing with a friend!   Heads up thou - on weekends, the wait is close to an hour! ... But we did get our coffee while waiting outside :)"}
{"text":"Food Art.  Food can be an art form and if you would like to experience this first hand, this is precisely what you will get at Monki.  Ty and Jarrett have obviously put their hearts and souls into to this little treasure of a spot ... and it shows.  Exquisite flavours balanced with atmosphere and exceptional service.  You're gonna love it ...!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, delicious and great breakfast. I like that they offer coffee while one is waiting to be sited."}
{"text":"Definitely in the rarified category of breakfast/lunch only spots that have a constant queue to get in, and with good reason.  The brisket skillet and the nutella banana French toast were both excellent, with the types of decorative edible flowers, oozy eggs, melt in your mouth meat, well matched accompanying veg, and unctuous bread you expect at a top notch restaurant (breakfast or not). There are only 6 or so tables here. Sitting at the bar, you are separated from the cooking by a wall of 100's of hot sauces, which if knocked would surely hasten the Inevitable Heat Death of the Universe.  My suggestion is to go on a sunny morning, and you can wile the time away in the waiting area courtyard, where coffee is served. While they do take out, they do not answer their phone, so in person ordering and pickup is also an option for the slightly impatient."}
{"text":"I am in love with Monki! Excellent food with friendly staff. My staple is the Chorizo Eggs Benedict and my Boyfriend is in love with the Brisket Hash. We go on the weekend and are sure to arrive 10 min before they open so we don't have to wait. However is early mornings aren't your thing be prepared for a bit of a wait, it's well worth it though!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast food, long wait on the weekends.  This little breakfast spot has a casual atmosphere combined with amazing bacon, well made eggs bennis and some lighter breakfast choices for those trying to appear healthy on an early morning date.   Be warned, the hip crowd loves this place on the weekend with the wait for a table sometimes over an hour."}
{"text":"First the good: vegan options!!! Three solid options and great hashbrown.   I ordered the salmon benny. I was very underwhelmed. I think it was the bread that thre me- small slices of white bread are just dissappointing. But the hollidaise was nice and tangy. They also have an awesome selection of hot sauces. For the price I was expecting a bit more salmon. The fruit was a wee bit sad- like day old oranges- not a make a break deal for me.  Service was good and the atmosphere is really nice- love the exposed brick and the music.   Overall i'd come back for the vegan options but skip the benny."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. Super long wait as they only have 10-15 seats inside and the patio wasn't open. The space is cute but they're doing Calgary in injustice by not expanding."}
{"text":"I had my first experience at Monki last month. The host and server that we had were extremely friendly and easy to talk to. This was impressive given we were there at a busy time on the weekend and they were willing to take the time to chat with the patrons. The patio was very clean and the atmosphere was so laid back. Good options for both meat eaters and vegetarians! I had the most delicious eggs benny and they were lenient with adding certain items from the meal (I always need to add avocado :) ) Oh, and the mimosa was incredibly refreshing! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Mmmmm breakfast. Does it get much better than rolling out of bed late on a Saturday morning, looking in the fridge, and thinking, \"nope this ain't gonna cut it, I'm going out!\".  I've passed by Monki a few times and wanted to try it so this last Saturday was the perfect opportunity. My BF and I arrived around 11 I think (who's really looking at their watch on Saturday morning?) and found a line up in the tiny entry way. Thankfully there was enough room for us to squeeze inside but I feel a twinge of guilt for those who came after us and had to stand outside to wait. The wait was a bit longer than I would have liked, but from my vantage point I could pretty much see every table in the place and it's not as if the staff could have done anything without being rude.  We ended up getting a seat at the bar at about 12pm. The kitchen is sort of semi-open, and while I'm usually a big fan, here it just didn't seem to work. they have all kinds of hot sauce lined up along the shelf in front of your face when you're sitting at the bar so you can't really see much of whats happening anyways. and I could see into the dishpit. Not really what I want to look at when I'm eating. And the chefs just didn't seem cheery or personable enough to be working an open kitchen.  Our server was fantastic and got our food orders in right away as we pretty much knew what we wanted right when we sat down. I ordered the chorizo and goat cheese Benedict and my BF got the mac and cheese, after being advised by our server that it's amazing. He was right. Filled with creamy penne noodles, crab, lobster, bacon and truffle-infused bread crumbs, how can you go wrong? My Benedict was just as satisfying with a light prosecco hollandaise sauce and a small bit of fruit in addition to the side of potato wedges.   The perfect amount of food, and although it is a bit pricey, it's totally worth it for the fresh, delicious food, the relaxing atmosphere and the great service.Also, who doesn't love a fortune cookie after breakfast?"}
{"text":"The food here is terrible, sugar on potatoes, no seasoning whatsoever on the pulled pork resembling \"brisket\" and the most unprofessional waitstaff I have yet to encounter. Perhaps if one were blinded by the hipster veil of incompetence and self righteousness you'd be able to find a place like this enjoyable, but the flavors found at this establishment leave so much more to be desired. I suppose the wonderful selection of hot sauces is fitting, because if one were to eat any of the dishes found on the menu without drowning it in hot sauce you would be confronted with an inedible meal. The only redeeming part of my experience was the fact that someone in the kitchen was able to cook eggs properly. I will never be back to Monki as doing so is simply unjustifiable from an objective standpoint. If you value food you will take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Monki! Aside from it feeling like a sauna inside on hot days, it's a cute intimate spot with great service, good coffee and delicious food. Make sure you are there early if you want a seat without a long wait. Nice little patio too!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fun of pretzels, but they had one amazing pretzel burger that came with a nice salad. I must say the dressing on the salad was really good! They also had their own home made different flavored jams which were pretty good! The wait time for a table was an hour :S"}
{"text":"Simply the best breakfast joint in calgary. I've only been during the week because I imagine the wait to be fairly long on the weekend. But its stellar. That brisket hash! So go and check it out. And if you don't mind a line it's certainly worth it."}
{"text":"Since it's opening, I haven't gone back because brunch lines suck & the wait for Monki is no exception. But they were recently added to the list of brunch places on the NoWait app so we decided to try it. We got there, waited, then went across to the ridiculous $$$$ organic heaven that is CNF, then waited again when told our table was ready, then finally got seated.   We ordered a variety of different things, but my biggest disappointment was how tiny the bennies were. The biscuits were gluten free - not by choice I don't discriminate against gluten - and too chewy for my taste.. like a ciabatta texture. My bennies were also topped with those nasty skinny sprout things that were not in the menu description which I did not appreciate for neither taste or aesthetic.   Can we also talk about the potatoes for a second? I am a big fan of potatoes - hash, mash, baked, fried, etc. So naturally again disappointed with the amount of potato distributed to my plate, considering the hash is probably one of their cheapest products to make, don't even really know if I can really call it a hash? They were really just giant cubes. They were also seasoned with sugar.. maybe it's considered hip to have savoury foods be sweet but if I order something savoury I expect my entire plate to be more or less savoury I don't want no dessert potatoes. Because of how giant the pieces were though.. there wasn't that much sweetness that I had to battle anyway so I guess that's a win?   Anyways.. to sum it up. It's tiny, the wait's long - even with the NoWait app, service is not on the quick side, the portions are small, & street parking is only free on Sundays."}
{"text":"Great brunch food. Got in very quickly once we joined the wait line on yelp. Skillet hash was just the right size as was the Monki perogies. Tasty food and a nice spicy hot Caesar to relax us. Service was very cheerful, friendly and knowledgeable, but a bit slow. This was due to the fact that it is a small place with tables packed in and possibly not enough servers to handle the crowd."}
{"text":"Absolutely exceptional service, food, and atmosphere. My new favourite breakfast place. Oh, great coffee too!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for breakfast and I was so happy! Great food and service. Wonderful place for a date."}
{"text":"Delicious! I have been wanting to try this place for a while, and finally had the chance. Went on a Sunday morning around noon (the one Sunday I was not hungover), still had to wait about 30 minutes. It is a really small place, but the turnover is quite quick. The staff is super friendly and brings you coffee while you wait, which was great bc it was cold.   I ordered the spinach and red pepper benny. The hollandaise sauce is made with prosecco. What more could you ask for! And the selection of hot sauce, unreal. The eggs were perfect, and a pretty large size that I couldn't even finish it all.   The only downside is the wait, but it is understandable bc the food is great and the place is pretty small. But the turnover is pretty quick if you are with a small group.   Love it! Will be back."}
{"text":"I tried to have breakfast with my baby and I had a stroller with me... On my way to the restaurant was raining and it stopped when I arrived to the place. They said they're not allowed to have strollers inside which I understand so I told the waitress I can fold the stroller to make it really compact, she went inside to ask and came back saying to leave the stroller outside under an umbrella or under stairs... Still outside... I said no because could get wet if rains again and they preferred to lose a client instead of help me putting the folded stroller on the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"A busy weekend breakfast place, Nowait is a great option for here. The day we went was so loud & hot inside it was unbearable. The bennies & skillets were average in flavour. The accommanying pan-fried potatoes were served with brown sugar, cinnamon & cayenne. So unique & sweet, they should have been described somewhere on the menu, so one could opt out. When the server asked about them, her only offer was to remove them from our plate. Unlikely to return."}
{"text":"I had the brisket which is apparently their speciality. It was mediocre at best, strange harsh seasoning, soggy potatoes and a lack lustre hollandaise. When I told the waitress she told me it was their best dish. Not a great solution to the problem and if it's your best dish then you've got major problems. Like the room but won't be back. There are far too many good restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I've been holding off writing a review of Monki because I wanted to keep this place a secret. Sadly the word is out that this place is THE best place for breakfast. I've been coming here every time I can because I'm seriously addicted to the amazing food these guys come up with. Brothers Ty and Jaret own and run the place and you couldn't meet two nicer guys. They essentially grew up in the restaurant business and cooking is in their genes.   I've tried everything on the menu and each item is a perfect 10 out of 10. If you're only here once for breakfast, you gotta try the brisket hash or French toast. For lunch you have to have the burger or lobster mac 'n cheese.   The place is small (820 sq feet?) and there's always a line up on weekends so expect to wait a hour to get in (you can leave your cell# and walk around if you want). Better yet, take a morning off work and walk in on Wednesday through Friday. There is no better way to start your day!"}
{"text":"I had salmon bennedict in a gluten-free version and loved it. Not only was the main dish tasty the side of fruit was fresh and impressive - not the usual boring composition. The fresh cherry in the middle of Jan which was even fresh was a nice surprise for me.   Loved our server too!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Great Service. An all around stellar breakfast spot.  We were in Calgary visiting from the US and found this place on Yelp. It was not rated at the top but definitely should have been.  I had the brisket and sausage has, which was delicious. Everything was perfectly prepared including the eggs, which you could tell were incredibly fresh from the bright yellow yolks.   I'll definitely eat here again next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"In a word: cute.  Monki is very much the norm of tiny Calgary breakfast diner we have all come to expect. A bit outside the normal beltline foot traffic zone makes for smaller lineups.  Completely decent but expected food a la eggs, bacon, skillets, benny's and the like.   Good place if you are in that end of the beltline and want to stop for brunch.  T."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place. It's tiny...but luckily they have their patio open in the summer. Go early or be prepared for a long wait which is quite common for Calgary. The servers keep the coffee flowing which is nice. I loved the snow crab and mushroom frittata, not a heavy breakfast yet was very filling with the potatoes and fruit. The beef brisket hash is equally as good, with a hint of spice. They have a huge selection of hot sauces for you to dabble in on the counter."}
{"text":"I like taking my 5 3/4 (this is a VERY important distinction) year old little girl on dates when I want to check a place out. This place is only a few blocks from home and has been at the top of my Calgary 'Must Try List' for some time.  Attempt number 1: Monday and they were closed, my fault for not checking to see what days they are open.  Attempt number 2: They were on vacation. I was a bit disappointed that they did not post this on the website. It's quite a let down to show up at the door and find a piece of paper saying they are closed for the next few days. Not the end of the world, but I was then forced to think about where else to go near by before I'd had a morning coffee! Grumpiness ensues. :/ Attempt number 3: I called ahead since it's Good Friday (good job Colin). They are open at 9!! I got my date ready and off we go walking in the wintery Calgary spring weather. We show up right after open and there is already a line. This is promising. The hostess, Theresa, is very polite and greets us with a lovely smile. The vibe is very relaxed which is great. There is no rush here. Side note: if you want a breakfast on the go don't come here. These guys are here to set a nice relaxed tone to start the day.  Liv and I check out the menu and order a chocolate milk for the lady and an Americano for daddy. They come out quickly and our lovely server, Darcy, asks me to let her know if I need any more hot water for my Americano. The service so far is wonderful. I'm happy.  Plates are coming out from the open concept kitchen and they look great. The gents in the kitchen seem to be in a good rhythm and are making this full room look effortless.  The reason I take Liv on review dates is that kids are the wild card. Liv is very good in restaurants, since this is the industry I work in and have trained my little girl to act appropriately. A couple staff have stopped to chat with her, which she loves and impresses me. Good job Monki staff!  We've ordered the Brisket & The Chorizo Benedict since they are popular choices.  HINT: Always order the popular choices when trying a new place. These are the dishes that built the establishment. There is nothing worse as a restauranteur then having someone order food that is one of the fringe, dishes, or a new dish and then writing a review. Try the dishes in their 'wheelhouse', form a baseline opinion and then venture out from there. Eateries and servers love to show off what they do best! EG Don't order a burger at a pizza place and then judge them based on the burger! Digging into these gorgeous plates! #nomnom. The brisket is tender and beefy. The high quality egg on top with the combination of potato, yam and sweet potato is absolutely delicious.  The Chorizo Benedict, where to begin! Being a type that limits my gluten intake I have tried many gluten free breads and biscuits. Most suck! The gluten free biscuit, I must admit, had me frightened, but it was great. Add the chorizo sausage, the beautiful orange yolk of the poached eggs and the hollandaise and you have one great benny.  I'm definitely going back and then I'll go again and again and again..... You get the picture.  So over all I give 4 stars. This could rise to 5 if the hours are consistently updated. I would love to bring out of town guests to Monki for breakfast, but since I'm 1 for 3 getting in, I'd be a little leery. Are they going to be open or am I going to find a note on the door? Even a note on the website would be helpful. That being said, once inside..... AWESOME. Thank you Monki for starting our day off right."}
{"text":"We have some wonderful breakfast places in Calgary, and this is one of them, but just off the beaten path. And worth the try, but can be a bit price and lines can be long, albeit, they take your cell number and text you when your table is ready. But not much around to see. And if you go shopping at one of the couple grocery stores nearby. Be ready to get your text.   Other then that kitchen is small so it does take time to get your food, but i enjoy the relaxation if I'm not really hungry for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've gone to monki several times now and always have a great experience. Sometimes the wait is a little long but that's to be expected when the food is so damn good and the establishment is quite small. The atmosphere is a bit squished but comfortable and they always have great music on. This particular review is mostly about the service although the food was exceptional as well. I went in on Friday March 18th and sat at the bar with three of my friends. The waitress really went above any beyond on this particular day, unfortunately I didn't catch her name and when I checked my receipt it just read \"server: monki\" but she had long brown hair and I believe a baseball cap incase her managers read this as I hope she gets recognized and congratulated for her hard work. As she came by to fill our coffees I was complaining to my boyfriend about how congested I was feeling. The waitress politely asked if I was feeling ill and after I said yes she pulled out some white flower Chinese medicine and told me how to use it. I rubbed it between my hands and inhaled and it really helped to relieve my congestion, I was extremely thankful. She stopped by later and asked how I was feeling, when I told her I was feeling much better I asked to take a picture of the white flower so I could pick some up for myself and she said we had lots and gave me the bottle she had on hand. It was very generous of her. She was very professional and her service was fantastic! Will definitely be back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Diner-gourmet. That's what I call this genre of noshitude. I've been here maybe 20 times. Never disappointed yet. The food is xceptional. There isnt a huge lomg menu of selections, nor is it expected with type of fare. There's enough variety among the offerings, though, that you're sure to want something here.   The staff are friendly and efficient. The ambience is great, set in a heritage-type old brick building. Cozy. I totally get why this place is so successful. Go. You're gonna love it."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars for food, but the service really brought the rating down. They were not very organized with the seating and were short and a little condescending to us. The chorizo eggs Benedict was delicious and the potatoes were awesome. We also shared the frangelico and Nutella French toast: amazing!! Definitely go for the food, but don't expect to be welcomed by the staff"}
{"text":"My only real complaint is that the place is tiny, to be honest. I wouldn't suggest coming here with more than a party of 2. They're using the NoWait app, which makes the wait WAY better because you can just download the app, add yourself to the waitlist and plan accordingly.   I had the skillet with brisket & pork sausage hash topped with eggs and hollandaise - yum. Price is what you would expect (around $20 or so per person). I really enjoyed the food here and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This little gem has a very cool and breezy vibe that feels right at home across from Community Foods. It is a tiny space, but still has lots to offer. Good music, clean and simple decor...with a monkey or two hiding in plain sight.  Kudos to Monki for having a delicious gluten-free biscuit for people who want to enjoy a Benny! I opted for no eggs today, but did have the biscuit (how could I resist?) instead of toast with my breakfast. It was soft and tender on the inside, and the house-made jam was delicious! So delicious, in fact, that it tasted like another...  I was a little perplexed when I received my granola and yogurt though. It arrived in a Mason jar mug and appeared to be more of a layered yogurt-granola-fruit parfait type deal. From the description on the menu it just wasn't what I thought it would be. I did have a chat with them about it, explaining that I'd expected more of a separate bowl concept where I could mix the ingredients at will (especially that fantastic coconut granola and lavender honey!) All I have to say is more granola, more honey, separate bowls so you can see the colorful fruit...  Next time, my mission will be conquering the hot sauce bar with some delicious eggs. Monki, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Da bomb! That hollandaise is crack! Super nice server let us try 2 different bennies in 1 order. Good tunes too"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out this place out for lunch and we were glad we did. I ordered the smoked Salmon Bennies with Fried Capers and a side of Valbellas Pork Sausage. My companions ordered a Morning After Breakfast (Eggs, Monki Hash Browns, Bacon, Toast), Chuck Burger with Egg, Maple Bacon, Cheese on Pretzel Bun and finally, my partner ordered a Grilled Capocollo, Cherry Tomato & Pesto Bennies. We loved their Monki Hash Browns they were coated in a beautifully sweet and savoury spices that was a joy to eat. Their hash browns is a mixture of potatoes and sweet potatoes and they serve all their bennies in a homemade Prosecco Hollandaise. However their bennies are not served on a traditional english muffin but a toasted canapes, which explains why I left still a little hungry.  They also serve cold pressed juices which runs $5 a glass. I was also impressed with the vast variety of hot sauces available , which was a plus! This is a cozy and quiet place, they have outdoor seating. This place can get very busy so seating is limited so be patient. A good place to just enjoy good food and company of friends."}
{"text":"...wow ....what a choice! Selecting from the various bennies...is tough..originally I had planned on having the fondue, with the choice three sauces....But from what I could see..this was the place for eggs Benedict. I had the spinach Bennie with roasted red pepper..my brunch buddy had the ham...we be both had fruit  on the side...and washed it down with tasty ceasars...yummmy   Yes, there was s a wait...quite a long one ...but we used nowait app....and were seated very quickly.  Check it out...great people watching and morning after the first date...lol"}
{"text":"The Monki Burger ..... SO SO SOOO good! If you plan on going for lunch - plan to go early or a little late. The restaurant is cozy and fills up quickly. Service was fantastic! Will need to make it back try out the  breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for breakfast.  Seems they have too many seats (in summer anyway) for the size of their kitchen.   Great ambience, good food but the waiting did it for me.  I'd be ready to try again, but not just yet..."}
{"text":"Brunch has to be the best meal of the week. You get to enjoy coffee, alcohol, delicious food, and great company. Monki delivers on all accounts! A quaint restaurant downtown with a reggae feel. All the servers are incredible. Even just looking in their general direction brings them to the table to help you with the next step of the meal or refill your drinks.  Brunch isn't brunch without mimosas and coffee. The orange and raspberry mimosa are out of this world. The subtle sweet flavor with the dry crisp taste from the champagne is perfectly balanced. The coffee is great too. And you can make it even better with a shot of baileys.  As great as the drinks are, the food is what makes this monki! We ordered the procuttio and fig panini and the breakfast hash. Holy crap, were they both delicious. The procuttio and fig panini was served with a wonderful salad and the presentation was perfect. The balance between sweet and savory was just too good. The crispy bread had that perfect crunch you just can't get at home. The breakfast hash was just as good. The brisket was so flavorful and fell apart with a fork. When you mixed the hollandaise sauce, fried egg, and potatoes with the sausage and brisket it was like a marriage made in heaven. You have to try them both!  Can't wait to come back to try the burger and bacon panini!"}
{"text":"As far as I know you do not have to be a member of the breakfast club to have breakfast here. Bistros usually have nice snacks"}
{"text":"Went there for my girlfriend's birthday brunch and was so impressed!   We brought a cake and right away all the servers asked us if we needed a lighter, platers and knives. They were so friendly and I did not feel like I needed to be a certain level of \"cool\" or \"hip\" to fit in.  I feel like the only downside is that if you come at the wrong time you won't get a table right away. They have a waiting section outside. But it seemed like they only had 8-10 places to seat customers.   But other than that, the food was AMAZING! And the vibe set an atmosphere for really good conversation and level of comfortability.   Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"After hearing and reading all the good reviews, we went to Monki for brunch on a Saturday at noon. As expected, getting a table at a lunch time for two took about 30 mins.   Once seated however, the server quickly asked for our drinks, and then did not show up for about 20 mins to take our order - in fact, we had to repeatedly ask her to take our order. When she finally took our order, it seemed that everyone who was seated after us was getting their drinks refilled and their food orders served. I have not felt so blatantly ignored by a server before - not only did she not ask to refill our waters/coffee, when I asked, after 45 minutes of not receiving any food, she defensively told me that the food is being served in the order the orders were taken. She then quickly topped off my coffee and slammed the cup on the table and ran away before I could ask her anymore questions (almost like she was offended that I dare ask her a question).   When the food finally came - an hour after we ordered - it was actually very good, though it probably tasted better because we were starving at this point. The server did not once come to ask how the food was, or fill up our drinks. When we were done, the plates were cleared by a busboy, and we had to flag the server down after 15 mins of waiting to get the bill.  To summarize - the food is good, but it's not worth waiting an hour for after ordering. The low rating is given due to the horrendous service we got - safe to say I will not be going back.   Side note - if you notice, the ratings for this place have been slowly dropping the last year, mostly due to bad service. I hope the management takes note."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for weekend brunch...and being a fan of monkeys, I was initially drawn by this restaurant's name.  After reading some reviews, I was curious to visit this tiny but eclectic restaurant.  Atmosphere: 3.5/5  Definitely very unique space - in total I would say it is only about 800 sq feet.  Trendy with very interesting decor including a variety of hot sauces on the bar counter, several monkey-related decorations, an open kitchen, and only a few tables with a narrow hallway.  Having read some reviews, I had already signed up 30 min prior on Nowait, however we still had to wait about 15-20 min to be seated at the bar.  Unfortunately, because the space is so small, there is really no room for huge bags or jackets.  I appreciate what they have done with the space, however I would have still preferred a bigger restaurant.  Location is excellent - across the street are several Korean stores as well as a natural food store.  I was surprised that parking was not difficult at all for a Sunday morning!  Food: 4.5/5  I had the smoked salmon and crispy capers eggs benedict.  It was delicious!!  Perfect portion size and the eggs were cooked just perfect.  I had the hollandaise sauce on the side which was good as I prefer less sauce in general.  I was once told that the quality of hash browns is indicative of how good a brunch restaurant is - and I have to say these ones were delicious =)  I love the few yam hash browns that were mixed in with the traditional potato ones and the slightly spicy but sweet flavoring.  The dish also came with a small fruit cup.  Fresh and satisfying breakfast!  Price: 3/5  As expected for brunch - maybe a bit on the average to high-average size for quantity  Service: 3/5  The wait was longer than expected.  There was some confusion / disorganization with the wait list, which was a bit frustrating given that most people had already signed up using Nowait.  Also I thought our server was a bit aggressive, but it was also quite busy at the time.  Overall average.  Overall: 4/5  The space is definitely small but cool and unique. I would say the food was probably stood out most for me as my favorite meal is breakfast.  It is a nice location for a weekend walk afterwards especially with the neighboring markets.  I would consider returning again but maybe at a quieter time to avoid the long line and packed space!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is probably the most important meal of the day. Monki Breakfast club brings it to the next level. I had an A-MA-ZING beef brisket. Congrats monkis!"}
{"text":"It's a tiny place can fit 26 people. The staff very relaxed, friendly, easygoing yet professional. The food is definetly worth the wait. Perfectly cooked eggs, fresh ingredients. Delicious. One of top places for brunch in Calgary."}
{"text":"This place is on the pricier side for brunch ($14-18 per plate). The first couple bites of the french toast were really good, but I couldn't eat more than half. I love sweets, but this was just too sweet. It was served with a small side of fruit which was hard to enjoy given the sugar overload. The eggs benedict had perfectly poached eggs but the gluten-free biscuit left something to be desired. We are not gluten-free and it would've been nice to enjoy the option of having a regular biscuit which they don't offer. The potatoes were coated in sugar which made them less appetizing. When you order a savory dish, you expect it to be savory.   We came here on a Wednesday so there was no wait. Indoor space is small but there is outdoor seating as well. Service was good. Free coffee refills. You have to pay for street parking."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant my friends and I ate when we landed in Calgary. Thankfully Yelp led us to this great restaurant.   Parking: There is street parking or free parking for 2 hours at the Co-Op market next door. Yay for free parking!   Setting: The first thing I noticed when I walked into this restaurant is that it is very small! The walkway is very narrow and we had to either wait in that area or outside. Since it was too cold to wait outside, we stood in the narrow walkway waiting to be seated. As many Yelpers have pointed out, the wait can be very long. You were warned! We waited for a good 45 mins until we were seated. The decor and setup of the restaurant is very cute and definitely hipster. There was a chair hanging in the middle of the room haha. The restaurant has probably about 10 tables and the bar area. The tables can sit about 2-4 people max. Maybe 6 if they combine them.   Food: Monki offers benedicts, frittatas, salads, paninis, mac n cheese, burgers, steak, etc. They also offer drinks such as juice, coffee, tea, cocktails, mimosas, beer, spritz, etc. Sides include fruit cups, hashbrown & aioli, bacon, toast & housemade jam, grapfruit brulee and Spolumbo's breafasta & sausage.  I ordered the prosciutto, brie, fig jam, & balsamic reduction panini with a side salad. Omg.... it was so delicious!!! It was the perfect blend of sweet and salty. I've never really eaten fig flavored dishes but after this, I was hooked. The side salad was also really good. Fresh and lightly flavored. The prosciutto did get a bit salty at times but other than that, it was perfect. The dish cost $15 CAD. My friend ordered the morning sundae which consists of coconut granola, fresh fruit, lavendar honey & organic yogurt with toast ($13 CAD). It looks sooooooo goood!   Service: We only talked to our waiter but he was very friendly and efficient. I can't see mean people working at a place like this haha."}
{"text":"Best potato's ever! Benedict was awesome as well. The mimosas are expensive and they skimp on the champagne, but they do taste delicious. Very hot inside and the service was eh. But over all good. Went at peak hours so they were busy. Waiter was very nice but forgetful. Over all good experience and great atmosphere! I'd def try again for another round of potato's!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and Jaret, Tyler and Stephano are world class restaurateurs, with an eye (and a palette) for details. If you are looking for a casual breakfast with style, you can't miss at Monki!"}
{"text":"Came here Wednesday around 1PM for brunch with my friend and we were seated immediately. We noticed the place was small, offering around 7~ tables and seats available near the chef area  I ordered the smoked salmon benedict and my friend ordered the chorizo benedict. Both benedict was topped with alfalfa and fresh dill (which gave it a nice flavour). The hollandaise sauce was amazing; it was rich, creamy and savoury that did not overpower the other ingredients in the benedict.  It also came with their potatoes, which was covered and fried with sugar. The sugar made it look brown on the outside, and gave it a nice texture. Adding sugar to the potatoes is a new taste to me, and I quite enjoyed it. However, my friend would have enjoyed it to be more savoury than sweet.   Server was attentive, and filled our water right away when she noticed it was half empty.  It is a neat brunch place, offering range of hot sauces and fortune cookies at the end of our meal. It is more on the pricier side compared to the portion you get."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in town. Hands down. Brought my 3 year old one morning for brunch and they were accommodating, polite and interactive with him. He absolutely LOVED the mac and cheese (sans jalape√±o peppers and bacon) and he's been asking us to go back there again, this time with his siblings, his dad, his grandparents and his friends."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here every Sunday,  but not anymore. It's under new management and it's obvious they don't know what they are doing. The waitress was nice but a little awkward. The food portions were so small we had to order extra food. And the mimosa felt like there was minimal alcohol in it. Please give monki back to the original owners. I miss the old monkii"}
{"text":"Steak and eggs, 5 stars.  The best in town!  Offering a thick cut steak makes all the difference (the meat remains tender and juicy).  The potatoes are simply the best, with a subtle sweetness and perfectly fried.  Put together with the rest of the ingredients makes this dish legen...wait for it...dary!!!  Grapefruit br√ªl√©e, 5 stars.  A simple but wonderful dish.  If you enjoy eating grapefruit, you'll love this dish even more.  The dash of caramelized sugar and warm tender flesh makes this dish all the better.  My only gripe is I wish there was more caramelized sugar! :)  Monki burger, 4 stars.  One of the best burgers in town!  The pretzel bun is surprisingly tender.  The patty and egg topping are perfectly cooked.  The aioli is amazing, the true star of this dish!  The burger was too tall for me to chomp down on but it was still delicious with a fork and knife. ;)  This burger would've been an easy 5 stars but the bacon was a tad too crispy for my taste (not sure if it was cooked to order or precooked like most places).  Lobster mac & cheese, 5 stars.  Surprisingly light for such a heavy dish.  You can taste every ingredient.  If you're expecting to see a traditional mac & cheese, a la The Keg's, you'll be disappointed.    Brisket & Monki sausage hash, 2.5 stars.  Definitely not their best dish...a classic case of \"looks can be deceiving\".  The brisket tastes days old...it is so heavily cooked to death that the meat has taken on the color of the sauce and is dry and hard.  It would've been better to simply toss fresh cut brisket and fried potatoes in the sauce since it's already so thick and heavy.    Overall, this is one of the best bistros I've been to.  To have that many great dishes under one roof is a testament to the owner's/chef's focus on providing a great product.  I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I would say this is a 4.5, it's downfall is the size. I'm sorry I get the whole trendy hipster crap breaky joints, but it's also annoying when you want to eat now, not in 3 hours when you can get a table. I had gone on a Wednesday, which we figured wouldn't be too bad...nope we still had to wait. It was definitely worth it though   All their egg bennys are on gluten free buns, which is fab! As I haven't had one in a long time :( And it was delish. They didn't ask how I wanted my eggs done which they should, as I prefer hard poached. And the grapefruit brulee was to die for!!!  The food is great, lots of options for those with food allergies/preferences. Location is a little strange and parking is a pain. I will come back for sure though."}
{"text":"Brisket Skillet. It's a work of art.  And that's all I need to say about this place. The dish really was that great. The sweetness of the potatoes. The golden blanket of hollandaise. The fried eggs.   Everything in between this dish, from the hot black skillet it was carried in, the cold winter day that tested my patience when I waited outside to get in, the elbow to elbow space of this cozy and trendy breakfast joint in the Beltline, the beautiful people filling the air with noise and life, the servers moonlighting as ninjas, and the hot coffee downed within 10 minutes of sitting in...these were all just background noise.  I wanna do it up again. Someone come with me here, maybe after a night of who-knows-what-we'll-get-into and share place of this dish along with other 2nd/3rd place picks I had to painfully pass up the last time I was here."}
{"text":"Even with some sunny June weather and an open patio that pretty much doubles the size of Monki, we were still looking at 40 minutes, which turned out to be closer to an hour to get in. This is what has prevented me from eating at Monki until now. I've also learned,  If you've got the time, the wait is worth it to eat at Monki.   If you want to kill some lineup time, I took a stroll down to Bumpy's http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bumpys-cafe-calgary to grab coffee and walked back. I have to admit, it was tempting to just give up on Monki right then and there and just grab some  always decent food at the more than half empty Bumpy's, but I can tell you now that I am sure glad I didn't.  That Brisket and Chorizo Breakfast Hash! WOW. I ordered this on a recommendation from *Lindsey L.'s boyfriend, who when asked about it could only manage the words \"Holy $#!+\". Done. This is the breakfast I am having.  A skillet full of potatoes, brisket, chorizo, 2 eggs and proseco hollandaise. I knew this was going to be one attractive breakfast but I didn't realize that the breakfast of my dreams was about to greet me at my table. With my first bite, he asked me how I liked it, the only words I could muster \"Holy $#!+\"  It's like a breakfast stew with I don't even know what for a broth. Love, maybe? Is that what love tastes like? One quick slice into the soft eggs on top and the yolk and hollandaise streamed down into the meat and potatoes. I think this is now love covered with even more love.  It's not every day a breakfast like this finds it's way to my mouth. It's memorable. The last time I felt this way was with OEB's http://www.yelp.ca/biz/oeb-breakfast-co-calgary-2?osq=over+easy+breakfast fois gras breakfast poutine. Taking a pause with every bite to savour and think to myself, \"HOLY $#!+!!!\"  *Lindsey L. - http://www.yelp.ca/user_details?userid=cW-twZduevD85PGE-3XN8Q"}
{"text":"Should be between a 3.5, and a 4  Interesting menu. had eggs bennie with capicolla ham, tomato, pesto on a gluten free bisuit with hollandaise - very good but not wow  Potatoes and a fruit cup also nice  a side of toast and jam, toast came dry with a weird mixed berry preserve with ginger, might make a better meat condiment than a jam.   Service was great, coffee was good  Just didn't wow me for some reason"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I sadly got an upset stomach, but needless to say, the food was still delicious. I went again a second time (the wait for a table and the food was long this time) and ordered the brisket and the sampler fondue and it all tasted awesome. I do recommend the matcha fondue out of all 3 flavours- I will go back just for the matcha fondue. I can't explain how mind blown I was when I tasted it. I definitely will be coming back often for more brunch dates, and am looking forward to seeing what they have here in the evening!"}
{"text":"I've heard a million good things about Monki so we decided to check it out today! We had an hour long wait for a table, which I know a lot of people are okay with, but I feel like that's redonk-u-lus for a restaurant. During the wait we had to pop across the street to get a coffee at Community Natural Foods because we were dying for one. When we finally got our table, the host kind of snobbily told me I wasn't allowed to have my coffee in there and took it away from me. Urrrrm. I just waited an hour for a table and you're taking my coffee away? Nuh uh.  So, then we got a lovely table and a lovely server and some lovely food. Actually, it was really, really good food. I got the breakfast burger, which was PERF. They didn't offer any of us a choice of sides, so I got a salad and my partner got fruit, and we swapped sides to satisfy ourselves. I thought \"you -WILL- have a salad with your burger, no more carbs for you\" was the vibe I got with the no-choice on sides thing, but I am defensive about my love of carbs sometimes. :)   The bill came and it was a big pill to swallow for brunch. We paid, tipped well, thanked them all and left. And probably, we won't be back."}
{"text":"A 4/5. The food is very artsy, borderlining the sweet side of savory, and bistro like.  As for the experience...If it weren't for the hostess accomdating us with coffee thru the 55min wait...  it would have been a 3.5...  only because of the wait!    So that says something.  I think the lack of room in the winter will make the wait somewhat too long... but our experience managed to pull through."}
{"text":"New breakfast place?! I'm sooo there!  Monki is a teeny, trendy new bistro in a brick building on 10th Ave SW. Upon being greeted straight away, a comfortable atmosphere was established from the get-go. The interior walls mimic the outside with red brick, while the seating surrounds the perimeter.  I could not choose just one meal, they all seemed so tasty! Though I listened to my stomach, and turns out I was jonesing for a meatball panini. We could see the eye-candy tattooed men cooking up a storm in the partially open-concept kitchen. The waitress cruised on over with our dishes once they were prepared in a very timely manner.    Upon my first encounter with the enticing presentation and the steam emanating from the panini, my thoughts consisted mostly of, \"I want you, sandwich. Get in my belly!\" My soul and stomach were both very, very pleased, bite after bite.  My mom requested the mac and cheese, topped with bacon (umm, yes!) which she claimed was rich, creamy, and cooked to perfection: everything and more that you hope for from restaurant mac and cheese.  The prices may seem a bit steep, but it's because they use quality ingredients. Monki has meals with flavours that you cannot simply whip up at home. I also advise to order a Canmore-brewed Grizzly Paw ginger beer with your food.   Show up hungry, and you will leave supremely satisfied!"}
{"text":"Well I have to say YELP you nailed it again! Not sure what I would do without Yelp in my life as much as I travel! This place was cute, farm to table type of fresh and amazing little atmosphere! I would recommend this place and tell you if benedicts are your thing, try the Chorizo - you won't regret it! Then there is the fresh fruit that was so amazing and a perfect sampling and the sweet potato home style fries where a perfect ending!"}
{"text":"Great staff. Excellent food for breakfast. Reasonable price (not Tim Hortons but not the Waldorf either); definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"I would recommend going in the off hours if you want to avoid waiting in line, because there always seems to be long line ups for the place! Understandable though because the restaurant itself is not all that big.   There is street parking you have to pay for on the sides of the restaurant. There is a parking lot across the street at the plaza with the Korean stores and the Community Natural Foods so if you are shopping there, it would be a good idea to walk over to Monki after :)  I had an eggs benny and my friend had a frittata. I am not a fan of frittata in general so I can't say very much about the item at Monki. But I looove eggs benedicts and I have to say Monki is one of the better places in Calgary for an eggs benedict. I thought the hollandaise sauce was a good consistency.   I also loved the hash browns - they were a bit different becaue they were sweet, I think they put some sugar on it. I also love the cute little bowl of fruits that you get with your food! At first glace, I thought the portion looked small but I could barely finish the entire thing. I also LOVED the sides of hot sauces you get! I tried all of them with my hash brown - yum.   I'm excited to go back and try other things on the menu, they all looked so good!"}
{"text":"It's good but definitely wouldn't want to wait for the food.  Respectable breakfast, had the steak and eggs and benny shared between us. Nothing amazing and more expensive than the other places in town.   It's trendy and hipster with a ridiculous amount of hot sauces to try but nothing to crave fro me.  Staff were friendly enough but the ceiling was leaking onto our table and the server knew and didn't accommodate."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place, the owners always took care of me and were really open. I went today, now that they are under new management, and they now have the rule \"no substitutions\". My favorite dish, which always had a simple substitution, is no longer available. And unfortunately the veg options on the menu no longer work. Bummer, I liked this place. Service and coffee were good and if you're cool with the menu then I'm sure it's still great"}
{"text":"The service is really good, the place is cozy. The food was great and we tried the hot chocolate chai latte with marshmallow... so delicious I recommande"}
{"text":"I went to Monki for the first time and I have to admit I didn't love it.   Maybe it's a victim of it's own success and my expectations were a bit high but I found the food acceptable and better than say Denny's but nothing I'd really go out of my way for and since it IS out of the way and you pretty much are doomed to wait even on the average weekday at a strange time it's one of those places I'll probably leave for everyone else that's obviously in love.   Hubs got the Monki brisket and thought is was OK but had too much going on with no star of the plate.   At least he was satisfied.     I have stuffed french toast and although the cream cheese should have been flavored with heavenly hazelnuts it tasted sour (not gone-bad sour... but the natural sourness of the product with nothing added) and honestly that consumed the dish when I cut in and it spilled out.  No amount of nutella and condensed milk compensated for that and it just fell flat to me.   Even the side of fruit was just ok... I'd had more delicious fruit from the grocery store the other day.   Presentation is nice and the atmosphere is cool.  Alright but not memorable is about the bottom line and if I want to test my patience before eating breakfast one day I'd probably pick half a dozen other places in Calgary first."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic breakfast here.  The staff was so nice, made the food so much better.  The steak and eggs seems to be the most popular item on the menu, looking around the room.  The hollandaise is such a unique treat.  I would love to come back and try more items off the menu."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and fresh. We got monki hashbrowns with aioli and panini. Both were excellent.  Great service too. Although they could keep the inside a bit cleaner.   All in all would come back."}
{"text":"A - List. Highly Recommended. These guys and gals do breakfast right. Quality ingredients, expertly prepared and presented. The food really is that good. The service was friendly, attentive, prompt and reliable. The place is on the small side and that adds to the experience - full brick interior, hardwood floors, lots of light, stainless steel kitchen, funky comfortable chairs and bench seating. So why only 4? These guys and gals aren't getting up super early and cook'n awesome food for 7.99 a plate. You can expect 2 full breakfasts + coffee/tea + tip to break the mid to high $40s. Expensive$$"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Food and Service were both 5 stars. I heard there is sometimes over an hour wait, so my 'we love to check out new restaurant friend' and I hit it on a weekday am. Sat outside and enjoyed a great cup of coffee while we waited for a table and then we shared two diff bennys. They were both fantastic: capicola and steak. Service was so sweet and kind and friendly - I felt like we were all friends before. Will def go back. There is alot on that menu i'd love to try. Go for it,  you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Changes and not for the good new ownership same menu but they can not execute it.  Chef sounds like he is Gordon Ramsey yelling service all the time but food has gone way downhill.  This place used to be the gold standard.    $35.00 for a single breakfast  and I would have felt better if I had not eaten.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Ordered waffles with candied bacon. Hubs ordered the brisket and the boy ordered the chorizo Benedict. Yum.  Everything we ordered was spot on delicious with a great blend of flavours and texture.  Each dish was artfully displayed making the meal even more enjoyable.  The entry is oddly hard to find. We weren't the only ones to go to the east side of the building when we needed to go to the west side. Probably more intuitive in the summer when the patio is open.  Cute relaxed decor.  Upbeat music. Decent coffee.  Would I return? Yes Would I recommend? Yes"}
{"text":"Everything was super lovely. The service was attentive and friendly. The food was delicious a little pricey for the size but over all great. It's also really convenient that they open at 7am on a Saturday.   One thing I would change is the shape of plates. Skillets or long small plates are a little awkward to eat from."}
{"text":"Good food. Salmon benedict is good so is the yoghurt sunde. French toast is something else very very delic. But poor customer service. Long wait for the food we waited 1 hr for 3 plates only. The waiter at the door is not nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Fantastic !!! We booked a table, and got in just before they closed but they didn't rush us to eat and get out. Our server was very chatty and friendly, made a few jokes and made us all feel like family. The food wasn't huge but so filling and delicious! It's pretty small inside but I think it's suits the restaurant, keep it small, homey and unique !"}
{"text":"Once one of my favorites, I used to come in for Brisket, Eggs, Hashbrowns,, it wasn't on the menu but the previous owners used to make it for me, substitute the chorizo for more hashbrowns, that's all.  With new management they said it can not be done, and after ordering a different dish which was ok but wasn't if you know what I mean, I did not enjoy it as much as what I came In for. I do not eat pork so some dishes for people like me or with allergies should be able to change, I was disappointed. Do like the atmosphere and staff were great."}
{"text":"Monki is one of our favourite brunch spots. So much so, in fact, that we meandered our way over after the Scotiabank 10k and had brunch before even changing and showering (I'm sure fellow diners were charmed).  One trend that we're loving is the callback method of waiting. You leave your number, they give you an estimated wait time and you're free to do whatever you want until you get the call. To be honest, we usually just browse the aisles of the store across the street, and spend way too much money, but it's nice not having to stand in the doorway forever. One downside? The doorway is tiny and if you opt to wait there in the winter, it's cramped, or freezing outside. In fact, the whole place is pretty tiny, so expect a wait.  We keep eating pretty much the same things every time we come. My dining partner loves the french toast, and it's not as sweet as one would think. I'm a fan of the frittatas. The hash browns are amazing. Everything is so fresh and tasty.   Sure, the price is a little higher than some of those places ending in y's but the quality is worth it. Plus, they have every hot sauce under the sun and then some. How can you lose?"}
{"text":"so, it took me a few tries to get in here, but I have been 3x in the last 2 months and these folks are consistently...awesome!  not sure about the monkey graphics with the knives, but it's definitely memorable.  things to look for:  1. fritattas, have tried 2 varieties and they come in a baby skillet (a+ for presentation) 2. their potatoes have a secret seasoning, which is awesome (sweet + savoury all at once!) 3. you will wait for 45mins -1.5 hours on weekends..so plan errands around this trip // eat a pre-meal // browse at the grocery store across the street 4. sitting at the bar is nice, because you can watch the kitchen team at work  worth a visit, but if you don't follow piece of advice #3, you might dull your hunger before you get your table."}
{"text":"staff was very friendly... I asked for another shot of espresso in my latte and for them to warm it up, they happily did it for me :)   Food is excellent... Very tasty"}
{"text":"I went with a group of four on a Sunday at 1PM. Probably the worst time to go, especially in the winter, when there is limited space to wait inside. Our wait was about 30-45 minutes (inside and outside, so not too bad). Even if the wait ended up being an hour, I think I would have been okay with it, since the staff were so accommodating. They even made a couple move to a smaller table to fit us in a table of four sooner (the couple did not have their food yet and thus agreed).   Very much appreciated. It's like when there's a huge line at a grocery store with only one till open and a cashier miraculously comes up to open another counter. It's so great it's on the Book of Awesome.  Anyway, I digress. I ordered the steak topped with eggs and hollandaise sauce. It came with hashbrowns and fruit on the side. It was very good, except I wish our server would have asked how I wanted my steak (medium, but it was served medium-rare, more on the rare side). I didn't even notice she hadn't asked it until I started eating. So I suppose that was partially my fault.   As mentioned by the other reviews, the space is very small. While the chairs look nice, they're not very comfy (I'm talking about the tall white bar stools). A friend of mine even complained they weren't big enough for her bottom. There's not a lot of space to put coats and purses either.  Overall, it's a nice, cozy place to have brunch. If I ever go back (and I only say \"if\" because I don't live in Calgary anymore), I would probably try the smoked salmon benedict, which looks and sounds amazing - and - which was what I wanted in the first place."}
{"text":"A great place for brunch, and the location is great. Everything's a little pricey though and opening hours aren't the greatest... but reasonable for a brunch restaurant. I got the 6oz AA steak & eggs, the steak was soo good."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch over the weekend and there was a really long wait to get in so get the no wait app so it saves you a bit of waiting!   The place is small but cozy and the servers were really nice. It was decorated well with a jungle type theme with small monkeys hanging off trees - its super cute!   For drinks I got the bottomless coffee so yea unlimited coffee basically haha   For food, I got the brisket, mushroom and truffle ricotta Benedict which also came with hash browns and fruits. You could get a salad instead of the fruits as well. I really liked this meal - the hash browns were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside with a perfect amount of spices on top. The hollandaise sauce was also spiced as well which was different that the other Benedict's I've tried. You can't really go wrong with a brisket and mushroom Benedict, like ever, so I would highly recommend it!  The hungry monki is basically the same as the Benedict but on a bed of hash browns so more carbs yay!   The table beside me were having the earl grey chocolate fondue and it looked so good! There's also a new Instagram pic of their chocolate domes of yellow turmeric, matcha and earl grey chocolate filled with strawberry and brownie and salted caramel for their dinner menu so basically I have to go back here to try all of that out soon!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Yes there is a wait, and it is worth it. Robby and the crew were so nice to us and even remembered us by name when we came back the next day. (Yes, we are here two days in a row.). Try the Steak and Eggs, French Toast and don't forget to booze it up with the Bad A** Ceaser. Great spot, great vibe, awesome food."}
{"text":"Just failed to seat us. Hostess notified us our table is ready after a 45 minute wait on Canada day - for us to find out the table is not ready. At that point the manager and hostess ignored us for an additional 15 minutes until we left on our own - starving and frustrated. Peaking their head out of the little door frame to check if we were still there. Also they removed us off the waiting list as if we were seated."}
{"text":"Quaint little place with amazing earl gray white chocolate with the most delicious waffles. We only bought a side dish to taste but it was so good! Had the pierogis and the pulled pork Benedict. Both were delicious. The pierogis had a sweet maple taste with the bacon and the Benedict was filling."}
{"text":"MONKI see, monki do. Grabbing brunch on a Sunday afternoon, you know you're in for a wait. Especially when your 10am plans turn into 1pm instead. Oops, blame it on the U & Me late night eats. We put our name on the list and we're told to expect a 25 to 45 minute wait (just plop your number down and they'll call you once a spot opens up). We crossed the street to grab some drinks at Community Natural Foods while we waited.   I wonder how much foot traffic they get from the Monki brunchers. I'd wager a ridiculous amount. The place was bumping with people sitting out on the patio and others lingering outside waiting for a spot. Calgarians sure do love their brunch. Reminds me of Montreal so much!  Several chairs and benches are set up for people who decide to wait outside. The patio looked pretty sweet but it was jam packed. We ended up getting a table inside where a warm, cozy albeit tight space awaits you. It can fit about 25 people if you include the high chairs wrapped around the bar.  It wasn't a big deal but some water started leaking from the roof and dripped right by one of our friend's shoulder. Gheeeeetto. It also took quite awhile for our food to arrive. We ordered way before a couple sitting beside us did but they ended up getting and finishing their meal before any of our food arrived. Yikes, another reason for me to never jump on the brunch bandwagon.  - Mac and cheese ($18.00) - lobster, crab, bacon, jalapeno and truffle-scented bread crumbs. The mac and cheese was good but I probably should have went with something else. This dish is better shared than consumed by one person. It would have been nice if they gave a side dish of salad or fruit to balance out all heavy carbs you're eating. Decent but the eggs benny was better. - Brisket hash ($17.00) - brisket, hash, vegetables (instead of fried eggs). My sister went with the brisket hash and thoroughly enjoyed her dish. The brisket was intensely flavourful and magically tender. No hollandaise sauce or eggs for her but they let her substitute for vegetables (good choice) and a sauce I don't recall. - Chorizo eggs benedict ($16.00) - Spanish chorizo, caramelized onion and goat cheese. Comes with side of potatoes and bowl of fruit. Our one friend decided to put her faith in the hands of our waitress (aka. she couldn't decide what to get as she wanted everything off the menu). Lo and behold, the waitress picked the chorizo eggs benedict dish for her. I had a bite and the eggs benny was perfectly fluffy, yolky, whatever brunch descriptors people use to describe a decadently done eggs benedict. They do it well here. - Capicollo eggs benedict ($16.00) - grilled capicollo, tomato and pesto. Same side of potatoes and bowl of fruit. That prosecco hollandaise sauce just oozing down the biscuit is pure gold.   You randomly get fortune cookies to end your meal. Interesting bit of Asian-ness thrown in for good measure. Overall, if your looking for a place to grab some grub on a lazy Sunday morning/afternoon and don't mind waiting, MONKI has all the elements of a good brunch place. Outside patio next time..."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday brunch with some girlfriends and arrived around 10 am but the line didn't seem long so we waited. But because the space is so small the wait was just over an hour. Yikes but I heard it was worth it.  Unfortunately at the time I had a fairly restricted diet: no dairy and nothing deep fried. So I went with the chorizo eggs Benny, no hollandaise (I know, the bread might've had dairy but I try my best with my restrictions). And because this dish lacked everything else that makes things extra yummy..so pretty much the sauce..it didn't taste as good as I hoped and waited in line for. Womp womp  I definitely have to give this place another try though when the diet restrictions are taken off!!!! Because their signature dishes served in a cast iron pan look delicious!  The service when you finally get a table is great! It feels like a cool little breakfast place that you'd love to hang out in all day long and chat with friends but remembering the line you were just waiting in makes you feel a little bad."}
{"text":"Life changing? Nope. Trendy and hipster? Sure. Service was good. Coffee was mediocre. I came here at a semi okay time. It was just the two of us and there were 2 open tables with room for 4. There was a bit of hesitation to seat us at either of them (which I would totally expect at Calgary Court during lunch rush...but not here.) I guess when there's maybe 10 tables in the entire establishment they want to maximize their space with the largest parties to fill large tables as possible.   I ordered the eggs Benny and it took at least 20 minutes to come. (Not used to how long it takes at my other go-to brunch place.) The first taste was good and with a little kick. I guess you don't get a choice of soft, medium or hard. You just get soft so expect lots of runny eggs. The eggs are great quality eggs; beautiful orange in color and extremely tasty. The side potatoes are alright but nothing to call home about. The fruit cup is unique and included a lychee, orange slice, watermelon slice, grapes, blueberries, and pineapple slice.   I'm just trying to understand what the hype is about. I feel like this establishment feels superior and cares not for the waiting customer. Yes it's a tiny place and there is no waiting room, but there are better ways to get customers to wait in line for a coveted table.   Would I return? Perhaps, but only if I were passing by and felt hungry enough to stop in to see if they were super busy. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to eat here like I did this visit. I just really wanted to try it and see what the hype was about. Although the service was good, it's the getting in part that bugged me about the establishment so I had to minus a star for that aspect. Other restaurants who are even busier have found much less demeaning ways to let customers in without forcing them to squish up like sardines in their tiny little closet-like entryway. (Hint: NoWait App works wonders!)"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. There was no wait line or anything so that was good. The server seemed quite clueless on things and she was very slow. Me and my friend ordered a coffee and cream soda plus 2 waters. Got our coffee and sofa but no water. We waited to see if they were going to bring it later but never did. I got the burger and my friend got the French Toast. The burger was ok, nothing amazing. I asked for the onions to be removed because I don't eat onions however the server said they can't make substitutions which I wondered how they would have prepared a sandwich for someone with allergies. The server also needed to go back and ask what was on the burger in order to tell me. My friend thought her french toast was ok but would have been better if they didn't have cheese and Nutella together. People who came in first got their orders before ours. Which our order took about 30 mins. And I also noticed that the server asked others how their food was but never came to ask us. Overall we won't be going back. Me and my friend were polite but just felt that the service was not great towards us and the food was ok."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Monki so I went in with high expectations. We waited in line virtually using the NoWait app so luckily we didn't have to wait for our table at all.   Service: 2.5/5. The server we had seemed 100% done with her job and it was only 10 am. I was trying to decide between the French toast and another sweet waffle dish and when I asked for her suggestion, she just said \"well, do you like sweet stuff? They're both good\"... lol not helpful????   Food- 4/5. I got the French toast which was delicious! My friend's got the eggs benny and said it was great as well. Coffee was cold, even the refills.  Overall, I'll probably give Monki another try because the food was good and I liked the overall vibe of the restaurant. Hopefully the service was just an off day and not the norm."}
{"text":"Great food BUT... Breakfast menu is good and everything we tried was of excellent quality But all your clothes will smell afterwards! The place is small and you hang your coat next to the stove! Everything smelled of eggs for days :-)) Tip: dress accordingly !"}
{"text":"I've been waiting a long time to checkout this place, and it didn't disappoint. This place is tiny! I loved it. It's super neat and funky, being in a warehouse-y type building.  Heads up, it is going to be a bit of a wait. Four of us on a Saturday morning waited for ~45mins."}
{"text":"After reviewing the menu, I was really excited to try Monki. I am unable to eat gluten due to Celiac Disease, and I was thrilled to see a number of gf items on the menu. I ordered the Benedict with salmon and capers. I was so disappointed when I took my first bite. They didn't toast or heat the gf English muffin. This is incredibly important when preparing gf bread. The egg and salmon were lovely, but putting it with a grainy, cold English muffin was a disaster. The hash browns were smothered in some sort of seasoning salt, chilli powder and sugar combo. It might have been okay with pork, but didn't complement the egg and salmon. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Yay!!! Finally got to see why all the hype was about!  My girlfriend took me here for lunch over the weekend, and given all of the good things I've heard about Monki, I was stoked! My first thought when we arrived was \"wow, this place is small!\" I now understand why it is ALWAYS busy. The decor is really cozy though! My friend knew the people working there so I cant accurately speak to the service, but we were seated right away and ordered drinks - a mimosa and a caesar. While I didn't get to try the mimosa, my caesar was out of this world good!! Just the right amount of spice and two peppers as a garnish. I don't usually order caesars because I make them better myself, but I can honestly say it was made exactly how I like it!  We got to ordering and seeing as how it was lunch time, I went with the prosciutto panini with brie and a balsamic reduction. It came with a side salad that was plentiful and delicious. I absolutely LOVED my sandwich. Loaded with prosciutto and cheese, with just the right amount of sweetness, it was perfection. The sandwich itself was pretty big, and I ended up eating the other half for dinner - it was just as tasty! A little on the pricey side (as most trendy breakfast places are) but it was worth it. I will definitely be back to try more of what Monki has to offer (the Mac & Cheese looks heavenly!)."}
{"text":"The best burger in town, hands down!!!  If there is a wait to get in, it's a great investment of your time, as the reward is so worth it!!"}
{"text":"Monki see, Wendy do! Or... eat. Yes. I was a first time Monki-er today and I think that I'm going to have a hard time leaving it at just one visit. I was treated to birthday brunch today and this was our choice. On a Tuesday at 1015 am, it was not a full breakfast club thankfully! Not that it would take much to fill it, what are there, like, 6 tables? Anyway, it's delightfully tiny which helps ensure you're well looked after and your food tastes awesome. You won't get stuck behind any big groups ordering here!  We sat by the window sipping our coffees (that were refilled whenever they got to half full. They never even had time to get a little bit too cool) and eating our breakfast. Me, I ordered the brisket and sausage hash with egg and hollandaise sauce. That hollandaise was bright orange and lovely. The sausage and brisket delightful with a bit of runny egg yolk on them and a piece of potato stuck onto the end of my fork before putting all of it into my mouth in one fell chomp.   If you like hot sauce, some will arrive at your table. Not a fan? There's a whole selection. Saunter over and try some!  So many more things on the menu for me to come back and try. See you again soon Monki!"}
{"text":"Great food. Little pricy on the food but food is really tasty. Highly recommend their skillets."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!!! Pushy and bossy wait staff. Place needs a proper waiting area. I'd give it a ZERO if Yelp would let me."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and friendly service. A teeny tiny place, I went on a super busy afternoon, and the food was out in no time. I had the chorizo eggs benny. Perfect hollandaise sauce on gluten free buns. Chorizo was perfectly spiced! Love this place, on my way there right now for some brunch!"}
{"text":"Not a bad little place! My girlfriend took me here for breakfast a few days ago and I have to say I am impressed.  They have an array of options for eggs benny, I settled on the salmon benny because I love capers. It was really good. The chipotle aoli was a nice little add on that I would recommend people ordering! Overall it was a really good meal! I definitely enjoyed the benny! Although I did find a long brown hair in it, which was kind of off-putting, but nothing major.   Decor is very interesting. I love the use of the space and the plants. The logo is also awesome. Whoever did the graphic work for it did a great job!  Server was friendly and gave good service, she didn't rush us or send the bill to early on. Waters could be filled a bit more frequently!  I would definitely return here! It was delicious and the space was small and cozy! I would also recommend to my friends!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. Decided to try it after seeing a post from yelp on Instagram. I ordered the breakfast fondue, and my friend ordered the chocolate waffles.  I love the ambiance and it wasn't very busy on a Friday morning around 10, and you have to pay for parking but not too bad! Coffee is great but my friend found it too strong, Service is good, very friendly, place is small, not good for large groups. The fondue was good but too dry, needed something other than chocolate like a sauce, waffles were ok but overload of whipping cream! Still good! Bacon yummy, but if I go again will try something else like skillet or eggs Benedict! Glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"I like going to Monki for breakfast because I know I'll always get great service. And on Sunday mornings, I usually need all the enthusiasm and smiles I can get from other people - something that's almost always guaranteed with a Monki visit.   The chorizo eggs benedict is amazing! I think some breakfast places need to rethink the \"heavy breakfast\" idea because their servings are bordering on excessive - that was not the case for Monki. The serving was just the right size that you can actually finish your order without feeling sluggish after a filling breakfast. I liked the brisket hash too. It was a little oily but it still came out full of flavor.   The Macaroni and cheese - I cannot even begin to explain how good this is. Just order it. I usually cannot say no to mac and cheese so I ordered this at 9am. It's full of lobster flavors, it's cheesy and it has bacon - everything you can ask for in a mac and cheese!  Thanks Monki for serving great breakfast! You guys are breakfast rock stars!! :)"}
{"text":"My only complaint is how small it is which makes for a long wait but that's what makes it special, once in the food was fresh and delicious, service was friendly and efficient. I recommend the baby spinach and mushroom eggs Benny."}
{"text":"Ventured this way with a couple of my friends bc we saw the picture of their chocolate dome dessert.  Anyways we got there 8pm on a weeknight and it was pretty empty. Service was prompt and very friendly. There are a few vegetarian options. I got perogies without the bacon, another friend got fries and we all shared the dome chocolate dessert. Omg it was so sweet I could only eat 3 bites. It was tooooo sweet filled with brownies and chocolate chip cookies with maple syrup on top. I wish they had ice cream in that mix somewhere too. Anyhow, I thought the perogies were nice and the dome chocolate dessert I wouldn't order again. If you are a chocolate lover you would love it. It was just ok for me as it was too much chocolate for me. I don't know if I would come here again."}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfast, it is also consistent, always good , no matter what you order. The wait is not fun, ... but it it is worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Monki and the menu was fantastic. We arrived after the morning rush so we're seated quickly and the service was friendly. We both ordered the coffee and it was not very good. It had that burnt taste. Our server indicated they were trying some new beans. I suggest they go back to the old ones. My companion even switched to an Americano which wasn't much better. We had a benny and a hash. I realized when I got my order I wasn't asked how I wanted my eggs done when I ordered so my hard poached eggs combined with the very little hollandaise sauce made for a very dry Benedict. The hash was also underwhelming. We were both surprised by and didn't like the sugar added to the hash browns. My companion actually thought it might be a mistake. The food was not God awful but we were expecting much more. Maybe we caught them on a bad day. Not sure if I'll give them another chance."}
{"text":"This is my favourite breakfast place in Calgary.  I visit Monki once or twice a month. Best time to check out this joint is to arrive early...aka 15 - 20 minutes prior to opening, if you are going in the weekend.   My go to is the Chorizo Eggs Benny.  I usually get it every time, but have been trying to venture out and try something new.    The food is always consistent and always delicious! Awesome vibe, awesome music and super awesome staff!  This place is definitely worth checking out and make sure it's a reoccurring visit every month!"}
{"text":"Heard so much about Monki, so today was the perfect day to try it. Particularly like the location because it's not quite in the downtown core, which means it's far more accessible traffic wise! We were able to score a table right away considering we got there right before the lunch rush.   Today I decided to try the Fritatta with wild mushrooms, red peppers, feta and spinach. It was cooked perfectly and came out on a cast iron pan, which kept it hot. The servers were friendly and on top of things. Excited to go back for all their signature dishes!"}
{"text":"So I don't know if this is usual for Monki, but I had just had breakfast there and the music was SO LOUD I could hardly taste my food.   Colour me old, but I actually like to hear what my breakfast companion has to say.   The food was okaaay, but loud blaring dance music at 9am is so not my thing - I won't be returning."}
{"text":"No one likes to wait an hour for breakfast but I would wait any day and everyday for Monki. It's a slice of heaven. I had the brisket hash and I swear I heard angels singing. My friend tried the chorizo Benedict and she loved it to. If you haven't been there yet then what are you waiting for....."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Seriously, everything on the menu looked amazing, and we were so tempted by the options. The place is small, so there was a bit of a wait, but less than some of the other breakfast places in town! The iced tea was delicious and the Mac and cheese is great.  There is tons of street parking (even some free 2 hour!) plus it's easy to access. Well worth the wait, and the trip."}
{"text":"Where do I begin... Used the NoWait app (which I love, and has never let me down). Put my party of 2 in line at around 10:10. The suggested seat time was 11:05.  Arrived at about 11:20 when there were still 6 parties ahead of us. Eventually at 11:40 we were sat at the bar, no complains there - me and my friend both enjoyed watching the kitchen cook.  Waters, coffee, and mimosas were ordered right away. Waters came first, and we ordered our food at that point. Mimosas came about 5 minutes later in much smaller glasses then my previous 2 visits. Eventually 30 minutes after our order was placed, our server came to confirm our order and said there was a confusing with the chits. As a server myself - I get mistakes happen I just think honesty goes further than placing blame. I know our order was forgot about as I could see all the chits from where I was seated, and saw that when our order was eventually put through it had \"911\" wrote on it. Server code for \"I messed up, make it fast\".  Eventually another 30 minutes goes by and our food finally arrives. I ordered the chirizo eggs benedict, and my friend ordered the skillet. If you've been to Monki before, you know there hashbrowns are 50/50 potato and sweet potato. That is no longer the case. My hash brown's had no sweet potatos. My friend skillet came with no hashbrowns at all. Yes - they fixed this up fairly quick. Before we were done eating we were asked to move down so they could fit more people in. No water or coffee refills were offered at any point, even when empty. We recieved a 10% discount, which didn't even come to the price of one drink.  The food was okay, but the service was the worst I have ever recieved in this city. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food, but very busy and no room in the restaurant to wait (they make you squeeze into the dark and tiny foyer, where we waited for over 50 minutes to get a table jammed against other people. Patrons leaving the restaurant had to also squeeze through to get by). The restaurant itself is tiny- a small room! As such, there is lots and lots of waiting.   Our service was also a bit questionable (our server seemed more interested in her outfit & chatting w/ coworkers than making sure we placed and received our orders in a timely fashion after being famished from waiting for over an hour to get food).  Won't go back because of this but did really enjoy my meal @ Monki!"}
{"text":"This is a cute cafe in downtown. My husband and I both had eggs Benedict. His was perfect mine was over done. Hash browns were delicious."}
{"text":"Overrated. Our server was less than friendly, paid much more attention to the table of 40 somethings next to us, and left us unattended. My boyfriend and I were left with empty drinks for upwards of 15 minutes (all the while glasses being cleared and conversation being had with tables around us). I can understand the place being busy, and usually am the first to be forgiving, but I work in a bar (and have frequented bars) with triple the volume and capacity and have never had the same issue. My friend was told she could not substitute hash browns for a salad as a side with her panini, or rather that our server would check for her.. he did not return or tell her whether or not she could get the substitution and was served her panini with the salad (also she had asked for a side of hollandaise and never received it.. she didn't bother asking again for it). The food was good. Wasn't anything above and beyond, and the cinnamon sugar hash browns did not work in the brisket hash or at all. Very weird, not good. Prices are too high for the quality of service or food presented. All in all I don't see myself or the rest of my party returning anytime soon. The bistro style has potential but definitely missed the mark."}
{"text":"Fabulous from start to finish!  This place is so popular that there is a wait to get in.  From the greeting to take our name to the very last morsel we could scrape off our plates, this was tops!  The presentation, taste & quantity of food were perfect.  The service & atmosphere were superb.  Right down to the choice of music & decor, this will surely be our favorite place.  We had brisket (OMG! Mmmmm) and Chorizo Benedict (Perfection)."}
{"text":"Food is great - comparable prices to similar spots, but the ambiance is nice. I bring my girlfriend here all the time. One of our favorite brunch places!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about Monki, and some of them were true. The food is the clear star! The quinoa bowl had delicious flavours, and the food was well-presented, I love the availability of vegan options.   The atmosphere is pretty but overall it is way too small and hot in there and when the inside fans are going it makes the lights flicker awkwardly when you look down at the table and we weren't the only people who noticed it - that is a major issue that needs to be fixed because it was a bit headache-inducing.  The wait times were to be expected and they do text you when a table is ready so that's convenient. Also, their patio wasn't set up on a 20 degree May day? I would have much preferred to be seated out there and it would have helped with the wait times. They may have been short staffed? Our server was efficient and fine but nobody made any effort to try and be friendly, and then the first automatic tip option is 18%? A bit presumptuous.  Overall, food is good, but atmosphere needs some help, they may have outgrown that tiny space!"}
{"text":"We came here for our first time on my birthday breakfast on a Thursday morning around 10am. It was a lil busy, we had to wait 20 minutes to get seated, which I already anticipated after reading all the yelp reviews.    Monki is a pretty cozy restaurant - seats probably max 20-30 people inside and 30 or so on their patio. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is great.  The servers were attentive and seemed genuinely happy to see us. The wait for our food was about 40 minutes, which is a bit long, but the wait was well worth it. We ordered steak and eggs, and salmon and capers beni.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the salmon was not overcooked at all! I especially liked that the food was not oily or salty, like most breakfast restaurants, I've been to. Their potato hashes were great as well, it had a hint of sweetness and maybe cinnamon?  Not sure, but we really enjoyed our meal.  Overall, I definitely recommend Monki and cannot wait to visit again."}
{"text":"I had huge expectations for monki considering last time I had such a good time. The lemongrass coconut bowl was just not good. No good flavours, nothing in the bowl matches well. The look of the dish wasn't even appetizing. Very unimpressed.   (Used to be 5-star review)I am so in love with this place. After hearing quite a few recommendations for Monki Bistro, we decided to get brunch on our last day in Calgary. Let me tell ya, I wish we came here sooner so we could've spent every morning here.  Service, amazing. So friendly, so approachable and everyone looks like they want to be there. Quickly seated at the bar, which was fine for us because we didn't wanna wait for a table plus the bar is fully stocked with a variety of hot sauces which ended up being fun for my boyfriend and I to try them all after our meal.  The menu has a great variety from burgers, bowls, Benedict's, and even a fondue platter. I ended up with the prosciutto Benedict and added mushrooms to it. Subbed fruit for salad. The hash browns that came with the meat are to DIE for. I could've eaten so many of those and I wish I did. I also got extra hollandaise for dipping, best sauce I've ever had. Even their salad was so yummy.   The boyfriend got the only burger they have on the menu. The fried egg had a perfect ooey-gooey yolk. Not runny enough to be a mess but just runny enough to coat your burger. The pretzel bun was so satisfying and soft. And of course the side hash him as well and he says the burger was so filling and delicious.   We were both really happy with our orders, we left extremely satisfied and pleased and would definitely need to stop here next time we find ourselves in Calgary."}
{"text":"My and one of my clients went to Monki to have our brunch on Nov 6th. Since it was around 2pm, there was no line-up, which was great! This was my first visit at Monki but that particular client seemed to go there often. He ordered one of their egg benedicts with fries and i asked the server for something healthy, so, she recommended veggie Panini. The Panini was good but i thought arugula inside Panini could've been sliced more thinly or perhaps fewer amounts would make the sandwich even better! The atmosphere is very casual and location is great too. However, they have an open kitchen system which means you clothes will smell like oil for next few days."}
{"text":"I really cant say enough about the service here. They are so genuine and good at what they do. This is probably due to it being such a small intimate space that they can give great attention to detail. Good portions for the most part. I do have to say that their hashbrowns are not my favorite due to an almost sweet coating on them, but although these arent to my overall taste the quality of food is still excellent, fresh and worth the visit to try. :)"}
{"text":"\"Where should we go for brun-\" \"Monki\". It will always be Monki.   If there is every a reason to go to this place, you do. Actually, you honestly don't need a reason, just an empty stomach. While their bennies are unreal, if you were to go here for the first time I would probably say to get the Brisket Hash. Unless you really like bennies, then get a benny, you wouldn't be disappointed either way. Their hash browns are kinda unique in the sense that its almost like there's a bit of a BBQ sweetness to it? I can't really explain it, but all I can say it that is was delicious and that you have to try it for yourself. Also get the chipotle aioli on the side.   Bonus points to the fact that their fruit cup are not just stupid melons and cantaloupe, but actual different fruits!  Wait times can be quite long, but I assure you its well worth it. You can either just walk around for a bit and work up an appetite or, if you need to do some light grocery shopping, there's a Co-op a block over. Two birds with one stone!"}
{"text":"This place looked like it was going to be good - cool style, friendly service, the menu descriptions looked exciting and mouthwatering. But then it was downhill from there...even the coffee was not good. Sugar in the brisket and sausage hash was really weird - didn't work at all. The brisket (beef) tasted like pulled pork. Mediocre all in all. My companion wasn't as disappointed as I was but he didn't like the sugar in the hashbrowns either and wasn't thrilled with his Bennys. Service continued to be friendly however!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Waited 2 hours, with a reservation on the online app no wait, which is contradicting because we sure and heck waited. Saw few people who sat AFTER us get their food... didn't get the water we ordered twice. I would be more understanding if they were busy but they weren't.  After 1 hour we received our food, eggs were over cooked for both of us, forgot the extra eggs we orders and also to kick it off we had hair in the mac and cheese. Disgusting.  The server didn't apologize or offer us anything to accommodate just walked away and grabbed the manager.  I can go into details how terrible we were treated but I won't. Basically don't waist your time."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at Monki, I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was $17. I expected way more food than what came. It was very good food however it was a very small proportion. Two tiny pieces of baguette with minimal sauce and a tiny amount of salmon. I left feeling hungry and ripped off. Time to go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"I really like the \"hashbrowns\" with the little bit of sweet and spice. I've been there twice now and both times I enjoyed it. The first time I had the veggie benidict and the second three smoked salmon bendict. It's awesome you can use the no wait app and save yourself the time standing around"}
