{"text":"Works everytime. Comfy food, good and fast service.  I like this place because you get your order in less than 13mn and the cost/quality ratio is ideal. I took the Florentine benedictine eggs (3,5/5) and a waffle (2/5), I was going to take a photo but my hunger took over !"}
{"text":"C'était le restaurant habituel de mon père! Il en aimait sa simplicité,  ses bons prix et sa bouffe grand public! J'y retourne pour les mêmes raisons. Un menu composé de plats populaires, poulet, boeuf, pâtes,  patates frites, soupe du jour...pas chers et servis bien garnis pour gros appétits. Un décor qui garde la marque du temps!"}
{"text":"The perfect hangover spot. I love this place with its classic diner feel and tin ceilings to boot. They even have bottled coke to match the vibe. Food is your typical greasy-spoon, but oh-so-delicious! Their poutine list is enormous, but you can never go wrong with a classic. My favourite menu items are their greek omelette, classic two egg breakfast, hot dogs, St. Henri burger, and of course poutine. Greenspot is pretty much good any time of day. We make sure to bring our out of town friends for a Quebec greasy-spoon classic dish. mmmm Is my order ready yet?"}
{"text":"Came here for the poutine, ended up going all-out and ordering the poutine with smoked meat on top. It was very tasty, though probably enough sodium to last me all month! The jukeboxes and decor were cute."}
{"text":"The quintessential Montreal breakfast place with fair prices, expert wait staff and great breakfasts. An excellent mixture of tattooed St Henri denizens and police and ambulance folks on meal break."}
{"text":"Adorable diner filled with comfortable booths that's still standing from 1947! Real close to Solin, a McGill residence hall, it's a perfect place to surround yourself with québécois locals. The service is friendly and quick and all food reasonably priced! I intend to come back for lunch specials. Buy for my breakfast, my Greek omelette was delicious and greatly portioned. If you appreciate the atmosphere of a hustling old time place then you should definitely check it out"}
{"text":"Ma cantine dans le quartier. Les soupes, burgers, salades sont très bons par rapport au prix. Excellent rapport qualité prix."}
{"text":"Love this place! Generous, comfort food that's affordable and ready for take out. Especially like the poutines, club sandwich, and breakfast. Get this: They forgot to put my toast in the take out bag and the cashier and cook literally came running after me for two blocks to make sure I got my toast and the order was complete. I couldn't believe it! That's great service, thanks Greenspot!"}
{"text":"Super satisfaisant comme nourriture du style \"comfort food\". Le sous-marin était gigantesque et difficile à manger, mais au combien bon!!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est bien plaisante pour le prix. Les poutines et pizza sont très bonnes, par contre les fruits dans les plats de déjeuners ne sont pas toujours frais frais. Il est toujours agréable d'aller déjeuner avec un ami en plein coeur de mon quartier. L'ambiance de soirée est aussi superbe. Le service est en général bon, par contre, mes amis et moi avons eu le malheur de tomber sur une serveuse très désagréable la dernière fois. Elle était très agaçante et agressive et tenait absolument a couper notre pizza en nous rappelant qu'ELLE savait comment couper une pizza. Elle ne cessait de répéter \" c'est comme ça qu'on sert une pizza! \", d'un ton condescendant et arrogant. Il s'agit d'une personne assez âgée, si vous pouvez l'éviter, faites le. Je suis certain qu'elle ne voulait pas mal faire, mais je n'ai pas apprécié mon expérience cette fois là."}
{"text":"I ate a steak & fries (upgraded for a poutine ). Meat was rose and soft. I recommend.  Service was fine, the waitress was super funny and nice."}
{"text":"Classic Montreal greasy spoon in a recently revamped diner setting. Staples like poutine and smoked meat, and some new menu items like pizza and souvlaki. Open later on weekends, a great stop for some drunken take out, but equally good for sit down breakfast. Coke in bottles, coconut cream pie, copper ceiling!"}
{"text":"I love any restaurant that has jukeboxes especially when there at your table. Decent prices and always seems packed. Really enjoyed the cabane a sucre benny."}
{"text":"Where to start? The Greenspot is an institution in the area. It's cheap, it's good and the decor is spot on! Every time I go there I love those tiny jukeboxes on the tables even though they don't work anymore. They're vestiges of the past when things were probably simpler. But here I am digressing. I tried many dishes and never once was I disappointed. Between the hot dogs, the pizza, and the burgers, anyone can be satisfied. But I have to say that my favorite from their place is the poutine. Not healthy, but so damn good! I took one with bacon once and below the mountain of guilt was a heaven with a tasty sauce, \"fleshy\" fries, squeaky cheese of course and bacon! But let's just not stop there as they serve one of the most killer cheesecake ever! Covered with strawberry jam (maybe a little bit too much by the way) it's so good and satisfying. Greenspot is a safe bet!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, but I am going to stop. The quality of food has gone downhill-- it's terrible. The basic ingredients are very poor quality."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for classic greasy spoon's alla Montreal!   Green Spot has recently been injected with some new life after its re-design. New shiny light fixtures and floors topped with a nice copper tin ceiling add to the old fashioned feel of the place.   If your looking for a great place for breakfast or for you standard diner classics this it. Friendly service and classics, like smoked meat, michigan style poutine and spaghetti and meat sauce.   If your in Saint Henri or near the Atwater market stop buy and have a nice greasy breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love having brunch at this place every Sunday. The prices are quite affordable, the size of the dishes is huge, and the environment is a bit vintage. You really feel that you have gone back 50 years across time. Here is the thing though, the service is not always the best, some waiters are just overwhelmed and some others are just great. I recommend to have the Benedictine Eggs, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"I would say that the Greenspot is one of the biggest hidden gems in Montreal. This place has every single type of food you could imagine. The menu is huge and everything is so good. It has a very old school feel to it. The seating is very comfortable and you get to choose where you would like to be seated. The food comes very quickly and the staff are extremely friendly.  I would recommend trying a poutine there as they seem to be the most popular item."}
{"text":"I'm amazed anyone could give over 3 starts for Greenspot. Yes, this greasy spoon has been here forever. Yes, the food is cheap. You pay for what you get, this is at best greasy hangover food."}
{"text":"Just an FYI, not many veg* options. Gravy isn't veg, but the pancakes are a little on the massive side. A little flavourless though."}
{"text":"Poutine: attention salt assault. The gravy will come and murder the soul of all the other ingredients so you might as well go for the classic no add-on poutine. Awesome fries. These unsalted thick-cut meaty fries come with a nice crisp on the outside. They're a bit crispy to eat on their own imo but in a poutine they're great.  Steamie: did you see the size of that sauerkraut? It's a humongous and that's how I want it. Plus it's served on a plate giving an added sense of abundance. Thank you I will gladly pay $2 for that hot dog.  Someone mentioned smoked meat here. While enjoying my greasy late-night dinner at the counter, I watched as one of the guys in the prep area took out a big piece of Lester's smoked meat brisket from the fridge and mounted it on the cutter. The mystical machine then sliced and simultaneously steamed the smoked meat, giving thin hot slices of smoked meat on the plate as if it came out fresh from the smoker. So that's how it's made, huh! What a sacrilege. Seeing my curiosity, the kitchen guy gave me half a sandwich to try and to non-surprise, it tasted like standard hot dog joint smoked meat, salty, too dry, and lacks spice - nothing close of the authentic stuff."}
{"text":"Location: Notre-Dame West. The closest  subway is probably Lionel-Groulx, and street parking is available (metered).  The place: Old-school diner type of establishment, with mini jukeboxes on the tables and the menu splattered across the wall. Don't expect fancy decor because you won't get it.   The food: I ordered a club sandwich that came with fries and coleslaw. My plate was HUGE! the club was fresh and delicious and the fries were excellent. There's not much more I can say about that.  Service: Very slow. We waited a while before anyone came to seat us, then we had to wait again for someone to acknowledge our table. Then we had to wait again for our orders to be taken, then delivered. There seemed to be a hell of a lot of waitresses on the floor so I'm not really sure why service was as slow as it was.   Price point: I think the club was $14, but you really get your money's worth. You can easily split the club between two people and leave there feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"The food is not cheap and is not very good. The place isn't very clean.    It's been open for a long time. If you want to pay for nostalgia rather than quality, this is great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Saint-Henri. Food is always yummy! Great greasy spoon type place that always reminds me of the diner from Seinfeld! They also have the most diverse poutine menu I have ever seen!"}
{"text":"Une fois populaire mais surtout prolétaire. À la limite de St-Henri, le resto est un tiers témoin des grands bouleversements du Sud-Ouest de Montréal. Tout juste à côté, le projet de Griffintown voit profiter une nouvelle vague au disposition bien pourvue. Alors, vient son lot de commerce et leurs moeurs de consommation. Je me rassure dans leur menu sommaire et franc. Leur plat de spaghetti est tout ce qu'on attend, soit sauce à la viande qui étend bien le gras en bouche et d'une portion qui culpabilise. Ne changer pas."}
{"text":"Not surprising that this is still a Montreal institution after 70 years. When I think of our city and even my family, Green spot is there. It's ingrained in our neighbourhood and culture. From memories of having a hotdog and fries after walking down from the Forum, to amazing hungover breakfasts with friends... the place cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast.  Old classic spot with menus in french.  The potatoes were so good.  They bring u coffees/cafes as you sit down.  Cool vibe great food.  If your American and want breakfast just go with the \"deluxe\" you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really nothing special by montreal standards. The place is dirty and run down. I don't need my hot dog joint to be spotless, but maybe they should rename this place \"brownspot\""}
{"text":"We went there as a second round following our dinner that was not filling enough. Came in with a craving for typical greasy Canadian food and got what we expected.   I ordered a steamed hot-dog with a side of fries and a side dish of onion rings. While the food itself was not extraordinary, there prices were decent. The hot-dog and fires costed 2.35$ while the side onion rings costed around 4$. Definetly enough food to fill up under 10$.   The ambiance was pretty cool too with lots of locals eating there. Went there on a Saturday evening and it was quite crowded but no line-up. You just sit down at your table and someone will come serve you. Service was pretty good too. Will come back later with en empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Un diner typique avec de bons burgers, club sandwichs et des frites maison excellentes !"}
{"text":"This diner located in St. Henri has been serving traditional greasy spoon fare for decades. I dined with three others at this establishment on New Year's Day.  We arrived to be seated at a classic booth with red leather seats and a jukebox from another era. There was plenty of elbow room and the ambiance of the place was decidedly blue collar and working class.  I ordered the Hot Chicken Plate which included French fries and vegetables (carrots and celery). The meal also included French Canadian pea soup, as well as a coffee and chocolate cake for dessert. This for the grand total of $11.67 (tip not included). The service was alright. I had to ask for a glass of water.  The soup was good traditional pea soup, heated just right and served promptly. The Hot Chicken Plate was also very good. The chicken was all white meat and tender. The brown sauce was thick and tasty. The fries were also excellent and thick. The vegetables were a little on the cold side. The coffee and chocolate cake desert were also good. All in all, the meal that I had reminded me of a meal I would get in a Montreal tavern when taverns were more prominent in Montreal. Definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"When you enter, you have a feeling that you're back in time. It's looks like an old diner. Food is average, nothing extraordinary, the menu is a classic one. Service is bad, it felt like not present, even though our section was empty, the waitress was away, and she didn't refill our coffee by her own."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has been in the same pot for years, but recently revamped its image for the better. The food is great for a fast food style menu, and the service is excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is gross. Tasteless and saddest burger I ever saw. Dry and tasteless and small. Fries under cooked and waitress can't understand english. Never coming back"}
{"text":"This charming dinner whisks you away to simpler times! It has a very authentic 1950's American dinner vibe. And just so happens to have the greatest chili dogs north of Coney Island! The food is typical diner food, along with some Greek plates and all very reasonably priced. The service has always been excellent and I love drinking a cold coca cola from a tall glass bottle!  Definitely go!"}
{"text":"GOOD POUTINE! 2 for 1 beers! Metro Lionel Groulx"}
{"text":"One of the last few remaining old-school diners in Montreal. Unlike the new-school diners where you pay exorbitant amounts of cash for pseudo-chi-chi-diner food. The breakfasts here are huge stacked with fat, starch and sugar and the greasy-spoon menu is awesome to boot.  A must for your greasy-intake requirements."}
{"text":"Mise à jour sur mon avis du Green Spot:  Même si je ne conseil toujours pas le foie de veau, je vous conseil très fortement une de leur Poutine. À date j'en ai pas mangé une que je n'ai pas aimé. J'aime particulièrement celle avec du poulet. Les frites sont parfaites et il n'y a pas trop de gravy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for poutine. The fries are tasteful and reminds me of my grandpa's. The gravy sauce is so dirty it makes me want to roll myself over in it....ok maybe not that good but close."}
{"text":"Très joli petit resto avec un décor rétro et des jukebox sur les tables puisque le restaurant célèbre ses 70 ans cette année. Excellente variété de choix poutine, certaines risquent de bloquer vos artères, mais ça vaut le coup. La poutine classique est délicieuse et que dire de la sauce! Impeccable! Ceux qui osent dire que la banquise et poutineville offrent les meilleures poutines à Montréal sont à côté de la plaque à mon avis."}
{"text":"J'avais souvent entendu parler du Greenspot sans jamais avoir osé y mettre les pieds. Pourquoi? Je craignais entrer dans une cantine de quartier sale et délabrée. Ma première impression fut tout le contraire. Un bel espace propre et rénové nous attendait, avec de grandes banquettes rouges ainsi que de vieux jukebox aux tables pour préserver l'aspect vintage de l'endroit. Ça commençait bien.   J'ai commandé une poutine aux légumes sautés (la \" bonheur d'occasion \", nommée en l'honneur du roman de Gabrielle Roy qui se déroulait dans ce même quartier ouvrier de St-Henry). Elle était franchement exquise. Notez que le succès de la poutine du Greensport repose dans le gout unique de sa délicieuse sauce noir. Vraiment unique, je vous le confirme. Paraitrait-il qu'il faut gouter à l'omelette grecque. Un délice selon les commentaires entendus. Pas surprenant puisque le propriétaire (Stelios) est lui-même d'origine grecque.   Un seul bémol à notre visite; la serveuse était mêlée comme une poignée de clous. On a dû s'y prendre à trois reprises pour commander nos breuvages, et même qu'à la fin du repas, ma conjointe n'avait toujours pas reçu le sien. Si on oublie cette mésaventure, notre visite a été un grand succès.    J'accorde rarement 5 étoiles à un resto de ce genre, mais celui-ci mérite vraiment sa cote. En passant, vous savez que ce resto est ouvert depuis 1947? Je comprends maintenant pourquoi. Venez-y sans crainte."}
{"text":"This place was such a nice surprise! It's not fancy, it's just your beighborhood joint. We wanted to eat brunch but it was past 3 pm. Then I saw that this place serves brunch all day! I had eggs with french fries and smoked meat and it was both cheap and tasty. The regular coffee was also very good!"}
{"text":"Restaurant de smoked meat à l'ambiance de dinner traditionnel.   Super rapport qualité-prix. Je n'avais jamais goûté la smoked-meat et même si je me lèverai pas pour en manger la nuit, j'ai bien aimé.  La viande était bien assaisonnée et plus que copieuse. On chercher limite le pain lol.  La portion est tellement grosse, que pour ma part c'était un peu écurant à la fin mais une bonne expérience !"}
{"text":"Came in from Los Angeles for the Radiohead show and left starving with no idea on where to go. Right before jumping on the highway we stumbled upon this place and am now a fan!   This was my first time trying poutine so I'll admit I have nothing to compare it to and am not an expert, but I will say it was absolutely delicious! I also ordered a hot dog and it was made perfectly...steamed to perfection with a nice soft bun.  Also the staff was extremely helpful. They went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and got my food ready super quick. I highly recommend this place if you want a nice simple diner experience."}
{"text":"On est allé pour le déjeuner. Portion immense, café ou thé à volonté, la table n'était pas assez grande pour mettre les assiettes XD  Bonne bouffe et vraiment pas cher, service rapide. En plus, il est proche du marché Atwater et le canal de Lachine. Je le recommande à tout le monde :)"}
{"text":"Since I ordered a takeout, I cannot comment much on the service. I ordered a smoked meat sandwich and a regular poutine, which cost around 17 CAD. The smoked meat sandwich was pretty good. They put a fair amount of meat and the taste was great. It might seem expensive for a sandwich, but the generous amount/portion compensates for it. However, the poutine wasn't as good as I expected. They must've assumed the gravy to melt the cheese but it didn't. The cheese was completely intact and separate from the fries. It tasted like pieces of rubber. Overall, the food from Greenspot is alright, but the price might be a little high for students like me."}
{"text":"authentique dinner comme j'aime! La sauce noire pour les poutines est dément ! Je recommande."}
{"text":"You can't help but marvel at its legend. Check the old signs and jukeboxes and settle in for this greasy spoon. Montreal has some awesome greasy spoons. I always search for them in any city - you get the heartiest dose of a culture there, without a tourism board directing you there.   The steamed hot dog with cole slaw on it was great. Loved it. Poutine was fine fine, and I found out that a \"Pogo\" is a corndog. Cool!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the Kingdom of the REAL Poutine!    La poutine est Québécoise et non Montréalaise, ici au Greenspot ils vous la serve dans sa pur tradition de l'originale (Granby, Sherbrooke, Warwick ou Drummondville)  selon votre clan d'où elle a commencée, cette frite dans de la sauce brune épaisse et salée garnie de fromage cheddar frais en grain.   Ici you got the real thing!  The Real Deal of Poutine!  Pas de chichi!  Au Coeur de Saint-Henri: c'est ici que j'amène tout les touristes ou amis d'ailleurs pour leur première poutine.    Ensuite on fait le tour de cette ancienne ville industrielle et des quartiers originaux et socio-historique de Montréal le ventre bien rempli!  À part la vrai Poutine québécoise à Montréal ils servent ici une grande gamme de mets fast-food, Deli et Grecque de très bonne qualité avec un service courtois et rapide!  Des délicieux Milkshakes et des bonne bouteille de gazeuse!  Ils gagneraient tout de mêne à ajouter la bière d'épinette et comme dans le temps les \"liqueures\" fruitées!    Alors à tous nos cousins De France et d'ailleurs ma suggestion est de venir prendre votre première poutine \"originale\" ici: allez au comptoir bar, et si Nick est là, ask him about the cheese curds aside à la bonne température et sa version de l'histoire de la Poutine et du Greenspot!  Savourez!"}
{"text":"This is a Montreal landmark and has been here literally forever.  Sitting in a neighborhood which is rapidly undergoing gentrification, Greenspot is a reminder of the working-class blue collar roots of the Saint Henri neighborhood back in the day, long before all the factories became chi-chi condos and aging hipsters moved in.  Prices have steadily been going up, it's still nice to come here once in a while see the old table-top jukebox selections, order some old classics like burgers and fries or an old fashioned eggs and bacon breakfast. Sometimes it's nice to go to places which don't change very much especially in this hectic day and age."}
{"text":"Can't judge it completely because I had take out, I ordered the regular poutine which was great and probably the best in the neighbourhood. The people inside were really friendly too!"}
{"text":"Avant que vous dites, \"4 étoiles pour un fast food?\", je dois vous mettre en contexte. Il était rendu presque 2 heures du matin, je n'avais pas vraiment eu le temps de manger grande chose de la journée à part une souper à l'oignon et j'avais peut-être pris un verre ou deux. Ok, je l'avoue c'était plus comme un verre, une bière et quelques gins! Alors rendu à 2 heures du matin, Greenspot avais l'air d'une bonne idée et ça l'était. Un poutine et un sandwich smoked meat séparés à deux m'ont bien rempli l'estomac et m'ont aider à revenir les deux pieds sur terre. Le service, même aux petites heures du matin avec un foule évidemment un peu saoule était vraiment bien! À essayer si vous avez faim après une grosse soirée dans le coin de St-Henri/Griffintown."}
{"text":"It's diner licious ! But no draft beer. Souvlaki chicken pita and classic poutines are great."}
{"text":"Many times we went there. Always somebody recommend this place.  I tried their smoked meat sandwich, it's good, but I didn't like the cabbage. Just it has no taste at all. We also tried many types of poutines. They are nice but nothing special. The volcano is extremely spicy!!!!  The service not fast and I don't feel they care about you're satisfied or not. Not my favourite place and if you ask I can recommend better place. Specially for poutine. I give them 3* because their foods are good, but not awesome."}
{"text":"The best greasy spoon! It's very near where I live, and the prices are great, so I am a regular."}
{"text":"Was looking for some food when we arrived late in the area on a statutory holiday. Despite being afraid we would be stuck with McDonalds, we were blessed with this hopping diner and its bevy of takeout options.  To be honest the menu was a bit overwhelming in terms of volume and options. I relied on some great looking Yelp photos to select two poutines  for my wife and I. Too bad they did not have a size comparison on the photos, because they were gigantic. We did not even finish one, so next time we will split a large order or perhaps even a small. They were both delicious, but the gravy on the Le Gadboi (poutine with hot dogs and onion rings - trust me it's obscenely good) made that dish the winner.  The atmosphere is full on classic diner and the place was hopping this night. Staff spoke English (several conversed amongst themselves in English) and everyone was very polite. I had take out, but they had some French mircrobrews advertised.  Most of the pictures on here are of sandwiches, poutine, burgers, and hot dogs. While I was there I saw a variety of fish dishes and some Greek specialities.  We will probably return for breakfast. Would be easy to eat for under $10 and hard to go across the $15 mark."}
{"text":"Un sandwich au poulet chaud qui en fait est du poulet pressé, quelle déception ! Trop sec ! Ni les frites appétissantes, ni les petits pois et ni le curieux accompagnement dans l'assiette n'ont sauvé la situation. J'ai choisi ce resto pour encourager cette institut locale au lieu d'aller au McD juste en face. Décision noble peut-être, mais pas mieux au goût. Moi le poulet pressé je n'apprécie pas du tout... Il y en a pas chez McD.  Sorry but you can't have my stars when the hot chicken is made of dry chicken. Did not like the fries either. Staff is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and i really enjoyed my breakfast. We arrived at 10 am and not long after, there were people waiting in line for a table. Our waitress was super nice and efficient and the price... dirt cheap for what you get!!! So worth it! I really like the smoked meat!"}
{"text":"Du temps'où je mangeais des animaux c'était un endroit que j'adorais. Pour quartier pour le côté people de la place et l'honnêteté des mets et que dire de leur tarte au citron...."}
{"text":"La poutine gargantua est écoeurante, elles sont d'ailleurs toutes super bonnes. Pour ceux qui ont un appétit d'ogre la grosse portion fera votre bonheur."}
