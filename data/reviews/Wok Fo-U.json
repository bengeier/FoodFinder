{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the combination plate. Rice was great. Spring rolls were overlooked. Beef was real dry. Seemed like it was precooked.  I'd go back, but I'd only get a specialty."}
{"text":"I came in here to get some Thai food to go. I was staying at a nearby hotel and wanted it to take back to my room to watch a movie.
The hotel had recommended it and said they would deliver. It was very close by so i just walked over there. There is a lot of parking in the lot if you decide to drive there though. I ordered Chicken curry and Phat Thai noodles. I can honestly say it was the worst i ever had. It had no flavor and the noodles were all stuck together. As if they had cooked them much earlier in the day and were just microwaving them. Yuk.
I love Thai Food and i know that each place is a little different , but this was really bad. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Indianapolis is two time-zones earlier than Calgary. If you're time-zone challenged, this means when its noon in Calgary, its 2PM in Indy.  

In Calgary, I woke up at the hotel, putzed around, checked email, read a couple of blogs, yelp, got ready for my meeting and left, skipping breakfast. Around noon, before returning to the hotel, my only objective was to get a chilidog at the A&W just down the street. I made it all the way into the A&W when I realized I had left my Canadian money at the hotel - which I didn't need really because I have credit cards. But I wanted to *spend  MY  Canadian  money*. Shit. No worries, I'll go back to the hotel, check out, and with Canadian money in hand return to the A&W.

By this time it was noon in Calgary or, 2PM on my bio clock (see above). I vaguely realized this depression in blood sugar was starting to affect my thinking - at least I knew that. But that didn't stop me from doing nothing about it. In fact, when I discovered the A&W didn't serve chili dogs, I left outright and drove around aimlessly for 30 minutes or more. For some odd reason I resisted McDonalds because it was, in my mind, too unhealthy - as if McDonalds could somehow be less healthy than two chilidogs and fries. I wandered until I stumbled upon an international grocery and went in hoping to find some nuts or dates or I don't even know. I found none of that, but I did find two packages of curry powder and bought them. I don't know why. 

Departing from the Mecca of weird and immediately inedible foods, I took a bunch of wrong turns and realized even more that instead of making it to the airport, I stood an equal chance of being immobilized by a hypoglycemic coma on the side of the road like an ant with a brain fluke frozen on a blade of grass glistening in the morning dew.

Then I happened by Wok-fo-u. I had to go in not because I knew I must eat - which I did - but because somehow I thought the name was a play on words and someone was saying to me and any other potential customer:\"wok-for-you\" or \"wok-f-u\" or \"wok-fuc-u\" or I don't even know...and I'm fascinated by these sorts of intended and unintended malintents.

Wok-fo-u seem like mostly a take-away place because the space is small, they have a counter for ordering and only a couple of tables. Plus the \"to-go\" signs all over the place are a dead giveaway. Even in my depreciated state, I could tell that. 

Unfortunately it took nearly 20 minutes to get my two deep-fried and deeply unhealthy appetizers - pot stickers and egg rolls. By the time the food landed, it had been nearly 20 hours since my last meal. I was nearly comatose and running dangerously close to being late for my flight. My decision to eat this meal in the car while racing to the airport was, in a word: Stupid. I bit hard into the first pot sticker and scalding hot oil squirted all over the place, but most especially on me. Still, with my starvation clearly in the driver's seat, I managed to get most of the meal down or, on the inside of the car while simultaneously and unintentionally filling the rental to only 7/8 of a tank which ultimately costs me 25 bucks.  

So yeah...3 stars for wFU for being such a good sport. What was I talking about?

They have Pho and lunch specials and its very clean in there."}
{"text":"I was late for a movie, so I just ordered a Vietnamese sub something that takes 2 minutes to make but no they took 15 minutes and the place wasn't even busy. There was only one table and they all already had their meal what could possibly took that long to make a sub. And that's not even the worst part. After two bites, I felt this weird, chewy, slimy texture. Yup, my chicken was uncooked. Strips of chicken don't take that long to cook, what the hell were they doing for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This is a great Asian take out restaurant. It appears to be a family run eatery, so that's a plus in my book.

The restaurant is not big, so it's not suitable for large groups. (Only 3 tables) They do mostly take-out and delivery, so keep that in mind.

Their menu is very simple with Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese cuisine.

The food is cooked to order, so the first thing you'll notice is the quality of the dishes. I ordered the Singapore Rice Noodles with Tofu which kind of reminds me of Filipino Pancit Noodles, but nice and spicy. They are very accommodating to Vegetarians, so if you don't eat meat they would gladly substitute meat for crispy tofu.

The prices are also very reasonable given the quality of food you are getting. There are plenty of parking in the area, and if you are staying at the Four Points Sheraton it is within steps from it. Very convenient."}
