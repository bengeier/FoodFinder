{"text":"Went there on Feb 11 sat. evening at 9pm for dinner . The place wasnt even half full. Took 10mins for someone to even notice us..  Then it took over 25 mins for drinks. Our server was to busy huging her friends that came in and  giving them the vip treatment while we had to wait another 40 mins for 1 order of wings, 1 steak entree, and a side salad.   I have never had a bad experience at any of the other Earls. But this one will be the first.  Then finding out that there is a 16% mandatory gratuity.  FOR EVEN 2 PEOPLE.  WHAT THE HELL.   NO WONDER NO ONES CARE THERE.   WILL NEVER GO TO THAT LOCATION AGAIN."}
{"text":"67 Percent - I fully fathom why they called this new incarnation of Earls, Earls 67. It's because you pay full price, but you only get 67 percent of a full portion! I've grown accustomed to, from dining at Earls across this great nation of ours and also the few locations in the US, the less than average sized entrees, but above average prices you traditionally receive out of their kitchen. Diners, however, often overlook the moderate portion size in lieu of the consistency in quality, service, presentability of staff, ambiance, and decor/aesthetics of all Earls. The staff will tell you that the moniker of Earls 67 is in reference to the 67th location of Earls. Au contraire mes amis, the truth is, to recoup the three years of planning and near seven months of renovations, the Fuller family who created this iconic chain, decided to only provide you with the aforementioned fragment of appetizer or main course that you come to expect from any other Earls location. The food is tasty, well presented, but exceptionally pricey when you consider the meagre offering you receive at your table. The room is very well adorned and stylish, so your eyes may be feasting but your stomach is left wanting. The G-Wiz had the avocado and chickpea dip appy and it literally came in what appeared to be the size of a small complimentary plastic ashtray you receive in Vegas when playing the nickel slots. When both the Princess Bride and Mama Bru's salads arrived, the Kale & Pear and Sante Fe 67 respectively, we all were incredulous at their sizes; PB counted SIX pieces of vegetables in her mix of greens. The Iowa Beast had the Bigger Better Burger and it was a touch smaller than accustomed to. Out of all the dishes, my Duck Breast was an acceptable size but the accompanying kale, corn, chorizo, and carrot pur√©e resembled the paltry bits and unpopped kernels in the bottom of your popcorn bag after watching a two hour feature film. The apple gastrique (which I asked for a little extra when ordering), though, for the duck was wonderful in consistency and its flavour. The tastes soothed our palates; the lack of abundance of volume of food, however, left us searching. I recall Earls having giant parrots as a theme in their initial stores, if only the servings had borrowed some size from their former aviary mascots to celebrate the 67 iterations of Earls."}
{"text":"It was not busy but somehow had to wait a long time for the server to take order and for my burger to arrive. It wasn't like it used to be prior to the rebranding. Not impressed overall."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Earls 67. I absolutely love the regular Earls and expected this to be an even better version. I was incredibly disappointed. The interior looks almost like a retro train station or someone said in my party it looks like a college bar. The Earls I usually go to in Signal Hill is beautiful! The menu was a similar issue, expected better than most Earls but failed in comparison. Was having some appetizers before going to a show and the amount of appetizers was so small! I wish they had the yam fries that other Earls do. When I read reviews about the 16% gratuity affecting service negatively I did not believe them but the service was very average and there seemed to be no teamwork. A table next to me asked a server (that wasnt theirs) for sauce and he said \"Ok I'll grab your server\". Our server was sweet enough and accomodated our time constraint amazingly well. The hostesses could not find the table our guest was waiting at and my opentable reservation was cancelled when we sat so I did not receive points. Overall I was really dissapointed but will continue to go to the other Earls in the city."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing, and our waitress was even better! I had the California Crab roll and the Dynamite roll. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and daily specials. Food was tasty and completely as described. Great for a couples and/or group of friends. Good mix of modern and classy atmosphere and quite relaxed . We had sushi app with steak and flatbread pizza as meals and would come back frequently if we didn't live out of town."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of my girlfriends for happy hour (3-6pm and 9-close every day). The decor and atmosphere was very clean, modern and classy and the deals were really good too. Well highballs were $2.75, as were the garlic fries (which were amazing!!) and the chicken, baja fish, and crispy avocado tacos! I had the chicken and fish, but my girlfriends who had all 3 said the crispy avocado one was the best! The chicken I wasn't a huge fan of, as it was like slow cooked chicken? and I didn't enjoy the texture but the fish was good!   Overall, I had a really good experience. It's hard to find a place in such a good location with these kind of deals.  Verdict:  Atmosphere 5/5 Food 4/5 Service 4.5/5 Would I return: yes!"}
{"text":"I really like this earls location so much more now that it's been remodelled!!   ATMOSPHERE:   It has this new open concept feel, the developer did a really nice job on the inside! The new enclosed outside area that's good for winter and summer, it's very neat and a cool idea. Aside from the upstairs area. Too hot with no fans, even with Windows open at night. And the poor staff that has to walk up and down those stairs all day or night. When in the downstairs area you can't really see the customers upstairs, so if the waitress goes up and they aren't ready .. Well shit, that's certainly putting the \"work\" in \"workout\" lol. Maybe if the waitress could see upstairs and watch for a waive or something, that would be ideal.  Anyways, we opted to sit downstairs in the outside private area (outside of the enclosed outside part haha) that was much cooler. But as the evening progressed it got darker and darker, and no one could figure out how to turn on the lights outside lol. The developer should have told them where the light switch is hidden haha. We made jokes that we will probably have to press a tile and it'll pop out haha it's a very new, modern and chic outside area so everything is nicely hidden. It's very pretty and worth checking out, I just hope they find the light switch! Not everyone will be as easy going as us.   SERVICE:   Our waitress was amazing! Really nice and personable, we enjoyed her bubbly personality and how attentive she was. I'll also add that the hostess who greeted us was very friendly too.   FOOD:   We had the meat & veggie skewer platter, which everything looked so on point! And it was! Aside from the \"fire grilled angus beef\". One would think it's chunks of beef on a skewer, but no no .. It was minced meat on a stick. Which honestly, doesn't look too appealing for one and two I felt mislead by the menu not specifying it's not chunks of beef and that it's ground beef. The little outline picture of the skewers even showed chunks of meat. Anyways, I personally think that should be changed OR the staff should be informed to let the customer know that it's not chunks of angus beef. Expecting one thing and getting another generally gives me the feeling of being let down haha. The chicken skewer was fantastic, and my gf enjoyed the veggie and prawn ones. The pork one sounded fucking amazing, but we could only choose 4 of the 5 options for the platter haha. Knowing the beef is how it is, I would definitely get the pork instead of the beef skewer.   SIDE NOTE:   I have to add that the lighting in the washroom sucks badly. Definitely not selfie worthy at all whatsoever.  Forget about cute washroom Instagram pics. It's a rather small washroom with minimal decor. For an Earls that pretty and revamped, the washroom should live up to the rest of the place. I guess they remodelled everything but the washroom.   Regardless, the new menu looks fantastic and I will go back. I will probably sit inside unless the light switch is found lol and I'll enjoy something else on the new menu. All the flavour combos look great. :)"}
{"text":"First of all you are advised of the gratuity policy. Which was overkill since it was well publicized. Anyway, the food delivery was slow and choppy. One of the four at the table was missing the Peaches in the Kale and Peach salad- how this happened is unbelievable- it's in the title of the salad!    Then the drink service was slow, we got still water instead of sparkling, refills were slow etc. It seemed like the waitress was busy. But the lunch service wasn't busy. Maybe she was playing Pokemon go.    My coworker sat at a different table at the same lunch service with a different server and had a similar poor experience.   The mandatory tip of 16% is grotesque. It doesn't reward good service, it rewards poor service.   I won't be back.  Unless Cactus Club is packed, Earls 67 will become the waiting area of Stephan Avenue - but it'll cost you bad service and 16% on top of the price in the menu."}
{"text":"I was here on Saturday night with 7 other friends for a farewell dinner.  The restaurant was not busy  ( surprisingly), but the whole experience was terrible.   We were greeted by our server, and although she was friendly - disappeared for extended periods of time. Getting everyone a drink at the table took no less than 20 minutes - the wait for the food was easily an hour, and when the food did arrive - The steak and sushi my dinner companions had was overcooked, the fries were cold - and our server just vanished.  We spent 3.5 hours there,   as it was the last time that I would see my friends again for a very long time - but the service was painful.  The restaurant was not busy, so we cannot understand why everything was so lacking - most notably the incredibly long waits for drinks and food.  Dreadful experience."}
{"text":"It was kinda a meh... I get the explaination of how the gratuities are now added and distributed but the service barely commanded a 10%grat let alone 16%.... and I am normally more like a 18-20 if they jusy make a decent effort.  Food portions were very tiny. We had the chicken shishkabobs as a appy and the avo and chickpea dip. Both were yummy but tiny. Like where the whole table stopped... looked at it as it was dropped, and then we all looked at each other and rock/paper/ sissor to who will get the 2 carrots. Anyways-they seem to hopefully be getting the kinks out as our server after the first order never came back. So after a while.. a long while... we asked the random server for our bill so we could go somewhere else. Im sure we will go back. I mean its Earls so we will find our way to it and the location and size of it on 8th Ave is perfect. Maybe by then the servers will actually check back in and they will add more than 2 carrots to a plate."}
{"text":"Went here after the 16% tips started. Best service ever. And the good is delicious. Try the bibimbap... Yum yum"}
{"text":"This is the newest Earls restaurant concept that took over the Earls that was previously in its place in Bankers Hall. The biggest thing most people notice here is gratuity is automatically included no matter what, I personally was fine with this no issues. I really like the decor in here, it feels much brighter and more open than it did previously. The menu also hosts some items that the other Earl's don't have. We tried several starters including the garlic parmesan fries, beet chips and fried pickles and they were all really tasty. This location is close to my office and makes for an easy lunch stop if we don't want to brave the outdoors."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of four for a work lunch.  The server did  indicate that the gratuity will be included which was nice.  It was odd because we had several people come to our table but yet only one was our server (this is the server that actually helps you).  I got a pressed tuna sushi roll and the garlic fries.  The tuna roll was tasty but definitely on the smaller side. The fries were nice and crispy.  It was a very odd experience since there are many workers standing around but yet we didn't have the best of service.  Most of us agreed that we probably wouldn't come back; their lunch was just okay as well."}
{"text":"I did like Earls but the last two times I have been in there, I have been deafened by the music.  I did ask Brad to turn it down as it was just blaring.  He said they couldn't so I had my food packed up and went to find another place.  Another lady came in and sat down and asked if they could turn the music down and they said they couldn't.  My question is - why is the music more important then the customers?  Turn it down for heaven's sake.  People come in to talk and visit or handle business - not listen to some horrible music.   A friend of mine and I went in last week as her husband had quite a few business men come in from out of town and they to take them to some place nice.  She liked the decor - said it was nice and bright and clean but couldn't stand the music.    HERE IS A THOUGHT - TURN THE MUSIC DOWN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner sitting at the Lounge Bar in Earls 67. Been here twice now and both times the food was delicious and service was excellent. The Satay was cooked perfectly and the Avocado Hummus was flavourful. Sparking or still water with wine and beer on tap.  What makes this place unique is the ambience and the decor. Using two different concepts united into one venue. Add on the new Atrium and you a place worth exploring on many occasions.  There has been some issues related to the auto gratuity but this is outweighed by the food, derive and ambience.  A new downtown venue worth checking out."}
{"text":"Design-wise, this new location has really pulled out all of the stops. Kudos to whichever design firm worked on this space. Unfortunately, the service as this \"living wage Earls\" leaves much to be desired. I've been here twice now and have left disappointed; \"barely phoning it in\" would be an accurate way to describe the level of service my friends and I have experienced thus far. The serving staff generally seems checked out, unknowledgeable about the Earls' menu, and generally unknowledgeable about ordinary restaurant service expectations (e.g. restaurant patrons generally like to have cutlery with which to eat their food...this isn't something that someone ought to have to ask to have brought to their table).  The food menu is fairly uninspired and if you're a fan of the classic Earls' menu, you will probably be disappointed by Earls 67's offerings. Several normal Earls' items are given a \"new twist\", which seems like an empty effort at making something different simply for difference's sake. Plate sizes are small (the restaurant explains this is meant to encourage sharing...okay, sure, I don't buy it, though).   It is nice to have the gratuity built into the menu, so this place has that going for it. My overall impression is that Earls is a brand that generally tries hard to court its customers with above-average service. This new concept is, in my opinion, a lot of flash without any real substance that aligns with the brand's core value of creating a great customer experience. Keep trying, Earls 67. Hopefully one day you'll figure things out."}
{"text":"Server is very friendly, went here Tuesday for happy hours and specials (Dynamite rolls, avocado taco, fish taco, garlic fries for 2.75) I love the place, get to sit in the lounge in a couch. Service are 100% good I had a nice time. What turned me off was the fish tacos. It sucked. I love the avocado ones and the garlic fries, dynamite rolls and my 1/2 prize wine. It was just the fish tacos. It was like burnt and grease. Overall it was a great night. Worth a try."}
