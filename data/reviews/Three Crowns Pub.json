{"text":"I am not sure why we rolled into this pub to be honest. Food was decent as was the service. It had that \"small town\" pub feel and the d√©cor/food presentation was defiantly not a high point. Speaking of the food though, HUGE portions... and you pretty much get a pound of cheese with anything you order - beware or rejoice in that one. 

I wouldn't go back but it'll be a \"oh yeah I know that place\" thing."}
{"text":"This is a nice little community pub nestled in the community of lake bonavista. The bartender Max here is so nice! Every time I've gone here (but only checked in once) it has been so quiet so there is not much to say! Love it here but food is nothing special just typical pub food."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little pub. The service is great and all the food is made to order.  There are weekly food and drink specials and live music on certain days.

The fish and chips, beef dip and yorkies are my favourite. The beef is slow roasted in house and couldn't get any more tender."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now.

Service is always good, quick, polite

Very clean, especially bathroom.  How clean your bathroom is, is a good indication of your kitchen

Portions are awesome, especially considering the decent prices.

I'm very picky - usually only give a 3/5 rating on places.
This place gets 5"}
