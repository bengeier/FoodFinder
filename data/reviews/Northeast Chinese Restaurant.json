{"text":"Two of us went here for our hot pot fix after nearby Liu Liu was full. We noticed several other patrons eating hot pot, so we thought we would give it a try. On the plus side, it's all you can eat, and they bring you a ton of food right off the bat. I can imagine language barrier could be a difficulty if you don't speak Chinese; luckily my rudimentary abilities let us communicate which ingredients we wanted, sparing us from having to eat our way through a plate of spam or offal out of guilt. The broths were serviceable, but lacking in flavour. Also there is only one type of dipping sauce, a sesame paste that must have some other ingredients added to it because it didn't taste like normal sesame paste that you get at a place like Little Sheep hot pot (the gold standard of hot pot as far as I'm concerned). Overall, this place satisfied our craving for hot pot, but we much prefer Little Sheep--too bad there isn't one downtown--and even making it yourself at home is better."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We ordered fried squid, glass noodles with pork belly, pork and fennel dumplings, and some obligatory vegetables. Everything was delicious and tasted different from one another. Our favourite was the fried squid; lightly battered with subtle seasoning. The fennel in the dumplings was very strong so I'd recommend those only if you're planning on trying a few of their dumplings at once. I wish I could remember the vegetable, all I remember is it had a great garlic sauce and wasn't overcooked."}
{"text":"Great pictures on the walls: the menu. The interior is typical but the food was pretty good... I had a giant bowl of soup - very tasty"}
{"text":"Northeast has its own unique charm (or no charm?). Very dive-y restaurant. Not the place where you'd take your date to. Cheap and fresh hemp beer on tap. YouTube is on for you to use as a jukebox.  No pretending and pressure, the atmosphere is relaxed. You don't even need to tip (server refused to accept tips on drinks). The woman server is pleasant and very smiley though her English is limited.   The cuisine seems different from the typical Chinese we know. Could be because they're from Northeast China? Manchurian. I'm not sure.   So far I've only had good experiences here. It's a character of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I was thinking to set foot onto this restaurant. It's very divey. Tablecloths were from plastic-like trash bags. The waitress didn't speak English. It says take credit cards but instead it only takes debit cards that require a smart chip. Credit cards with smart chips don't work here. Food was extremely greasy. Too much corn starch and so my ma po tofu dish ended up looking extremely unpleasant and sticky compared to the many ma po tofu dishes I've had. The seafood lo mein was slightly better but still very greasy. It didn't look like the noodles on the picture or what I'm used to seeing and eating either. The pictures from the outside looked awesome and the food looks authentic, so I gave it a go. I figure it's your typical Chinese food places but the food would be good but it was awful! Wish I had cell phone reception to read reviews before I went in. Should've gone with my gut instinct instead. I don't recommend this place unless you're totally trashed where food flavors and service aren't as important parts of your dining experience."}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I have to say this is the worst Chinese food I've had. If there's negative rating I'll be giving.  Been there once before, very mediocre food but edible. So we went there again for mid night meal because of the limited options nearby.  It was loud like clubs, because they have $6 pitcher. Young people (who I think mostly were under age or on age) were very excited.  Okay so we sat down, trying to order. After a while the owner's wife came and ask if we were ready. I said yes and told her one item, she then said it's not available. So I asked if she can recommend anything. She got angry and told me not to ask that, because they have 300 dishes that I should read myself, not asking. Fine, so I asked if it's possible for her to let me know which ones are not available. She snapped again saying that they have 300 dishes, how can she tell me which one's not available, again, I should tell her what I want and she will let me know if it's not available.  It was really my fault that I didn't leave after what happened.  So I ordered anyway. After a while, just when we were wondering where our tea and water were. An arm suddenly reached out from my friend's shoulder and threw, yes, threw our tea on the table. My friend literately trembled because of the unexpected  arm and the sound a tea pot banging on the table in front of him.  So I was ready to drink, but I smelt sewage. After careful inspection, it wasn't their tea. Instead, the cup smells like somebody's been cleaning it using towel that has been soaked in sewage and were never washed. I couldn't describe my feeling, I'm a foodie who likes all kinds of street food, clean or dirty. But this is simply unacceptable and GROSS aw.  I don't want to keep writing, but you should be laughing if I told you we stayed and had the food they brought. The only food that has taste was half frozen, that tells you all. DON'T GO."}
{"text":"Sort of a weird place to go. The wait staff don't speak English at all. The first time I came here I ordered a spicy dish and the waiter pointed to something on the menu. I assumed he was asking me if I really wanted spicy food so I said \"yes, I like it spicy.\"  He assumed I did not want my squid spicy -- it also turns out he was asking me if I wanted rice. I got charged for that and was put off this place for a while, but the poor guy seemed really earnest. It wasn't his fault.  So I came again with a friend and ordered simply. We both pointed to ma po doufu and hot toffee potato on the menu. The server this time was the man's wife. She understood and when we got our food it was delicious. Ma po doufu is excellent, nice and spicy with a good umami broth, and the portions are plenty for a decent price. The hot toffee potato is also delicious and sweet, but after ma po doufu it makes your mouth feel a bit sticky, so we had to take most of that to go.  In sum, as long as you keep it simple, this is a great place to go for lunch, and the wait staff are very kind.  A problem you might encounter is the poor atmosphere. It's a plain old room with tables and 80's-style posture correcting chairs. The tablecloths are grocery-store-bag-plastic, the signs are kind of garbled, there are tiny TV's playing Chinese news in the corners. I don't really care about atmosphere that much, so it hasn't lost any stars for that."}
{"text":"Oh boy I don't know what to say about this restaurant.  It has been around the area for sometime so I am curious about its food as it is not easy to survive in Chinatown.  The first impression is the restaurant is so empty on a Sunday lunch hour.  After doing a quick read on Yelp I realize it's because they sell cheap beer.  During my visit the restaurant kinda smell funny which is not a good sign, I guess I should have trusted my intuition and left but I've decided to stick around for one try.  Ordered a lamb noodle soup, the broth tastes kinda bland so I have to add some chilli sauce in it.  The noodle tastes sticky and the bowl was filled with a bunch of noodle with not much meat.  The price is just similar to other places nearby.  Being this is a family restaurant but I guess one can't call the service \"warm\" or friendly.  The lady is curt but at least not rude, which I can accept.  But overall it's really not an experience to warrant revisit."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem if you like northern chinese food. Go here often with friends and practically everything on the menu has been great.  Order the: Fish in Chilli Oil Hot and Sour soup Fish dumplings Kung Pao Shrimp  and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place as we were walking around Chinatown on a Sunday afternoon. We saw a sign for $6 pitchers and checked it out. This basement wonder is a true gem! Cheap drinks, awesome food (we ordered pork as Chinese chives dumplings and pan fried beef dumplings) and they were excellent! I dare you to find a cheaper pitcher of beer in the city!"}
{"text":"There was only one woman looking like kind of butcher doing everything l...  The food was quite normal and cheap. I got typical north - chinese dish without problems after about 10 mins.   The disgusting restroom with very bad and frightening smell for men was a huge problem. And imagine now - you eat next to that restroom."}
{"text":"This is worst restaurant I came across so far. The server comes with owner is so rude and disrespectful to customer. She is yelling at me becoz I was looking at my cell phone . Food is terrible and yuck . Waste of money and will never be back"}
{"text":"This is like a frat house. 90% of the table is here to drink as they have a special pitcher deal. I think $8-9.  This place is terrible. I believe it is the husband manning the kitchen and the wife doing all the front of house. It is not a small place so you can already tell it will be chaos here.  Food was terrible, my soup noodle was super overcooked and soft.  Taste even worst than it looked.  Don`t come here for food, only drinks like all the rest of the people"}
{"text":"The dishes I ordered weren't as I expected... Hmmmm they weren't like the dishes u could have in China... The taste was okay though. Their dumplings are worth to try for those going for the first time."}
{"text":"Super divey place that is famous for the 9 dollar pitchers. Came here last weekend because I wanted to try the food.... the lady who owned it gave us shredded lamb? Some noodle with shrimp and lamb dumplings. It was all a bit ummm funky tasting.... I wouldn't recommend the food but if you are looking for 9 dollar pitchers in a place with a lot of atmosphere. By all means !"}
{"text":"You're NOT coming here for phenomenal, authentic, Chinese cuisine. You go to this place cause Betty (the only waitress) is the kindest woman ever. You go here 'cause the pitchers are $8.00 and you can cheers with everyone else around. You go here 'cause you can play your own music on the youtube setup Betty has got goin' on. And you know what? The food may not be amazing but it's definitely better than some Canton Chili or New Ho King I know you're all getting delivered at  4 AM."}
{"text":"Alright, let's be honest, this place is a TOTAL dive and the one waitress/owner with her husband who cooks, does NOT speak English but I *heart* this place. And she's kind of curt but don't mistake that for being mean.   The food is really good.  My suggestions: 1) Chive pancakes 2) the 3 delicacies (eggplant, green pepper and potato) 3) steamed buns (there are a lot in one order)  The spicy dishes are good too, the diced chicken etc. And dumplings aren't bad but not my first choice.  Not a place to take someone on the first date but it is a great restaurant. And I keep going back. They also have exceptionally cheap beer on tap, only one kind.  It's funny, I love this place but I never remember what it's called. Thanks Yelp for just knowing and being so clairvoyant in your foodie ways."}
{"text":"Honestly, we didnt have luck in with restaurant.. there was two dishes we got that had meat in it and one tasted too sweet and too salty for the other. They were cooked in a way that one of them had too much salt to hide how old the meat was (my bf is in the food business so he knows).   Oh my goodness... I cant even tell you how horrified I felt after eating it.   The service was okay. The owners seemed okay enough but they didnt mind us too much as the other table had a bigger group of young kids so the kind of fussed on them more...from the looks of the group dining their faces they didnt seem to enjoy what they had either.   And the place, It seemed a little... well, there was a smell of mold around the time we came during the time it was raining... it wasnt pleasant... and it didnt seem clean also... so as am writing this... I hope they got that sorted out and the smell of mold too.   I hope this place gets better, I personally wont go back as it gave me such bad memories... but their food selection (menu) is quite nice as they had food I wanted to try.   Hope you have better luck than us!"}
{"text":"The colorful and extensive outdoor menu signs got us to come in here. We ate until we were stuffed and walked out with enough takeaway for an entire second meal. Sweet & sour chicken for the kids, BBQ beef noodles (recommend!) and broccoli with garlic for the grownups, chicken wonton soup for everybody. Yum.   I have to say, I'd give it a \"0\" for atmosphere (well, I mean, it had LOTS of \"atmosphere\" - gritty, grimy, covered-in-ad-hoc-Chinese-signage atmosphere) but the food was great, the prices were right, and the part it played in our overall Chinatown experience was perfect. We'll remember it fondly.  Note: CASH only."}
{"text":"The food is really good, the auntie is very cute as well. If you like spicy food, you must come here. But the pitcher here is cheap so there is a lot of drunk guy .......  overall it's very good!"}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant for a late night dinner as it was open late. Coming from somewhere in the North Eastern part of China, I was pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant dedicated to the food from the area.  After coming in, I realized the other reviews about the people sitting around with the pitchers is very true, but the food was quite nice. Some of it tasted like the food I had at home.  The owner is from Shandong and they offer Shandong, Beijing, and other kinds of food (I think Sichaun is one of them too, although its not in the North East).  I ordered two items - the cumin lamb and the lamb dumplings. Being a huge fan of lamb, I had no major complaints. The lamb dumplings were a bit soggy but I can't fault them for that given I had them in a takeout container for a solid 20mins before eating it. The cumin lamb was made from sliced lamb shoulder (what you find for hotpot at supermarkets) and was very tasty - for how much lamb they're giving you, the price is really reasonable (in my opinion at least).  I would come here again."}
{"text":"I think you either like or hate the place.  Ppl here seemed to all have a pitcher of $8 beer here.  The waitress,one person, does her best to accommodate everyone.  The food, found out I may not have a taste for northeast food. The quality, noodles definitely overcooked in both the dishes we ordered.  Overall, come here for the pitchers and fries and stay as long as u want."}
{"text":"I should have trusted my gut instinct, but I ate here anyway.  The pictures of all the food was what drew me in - seemed like they had a lot of authentic dishes (I was especially interested in the spicy dishes).    First impression - this place is a dive.  A dirty dive (I'm sorry to be mean - but all I could think of was \"do I really want to eat here?\").  The waitress didn't really speak English, and she was gruff.  I honestly can't remember anything positive from the meal, other than I was happy it was over."}
{"text":"I came this place twice. The hot pot is not impressive and I didn't like the dishes much. But the reason I'm giving it so little credit is thanks to its lousy service. I think there are only two people serving - one waiter and one waitress. The waiter is nice but I won't say the same for the waitress. It looks like a family-owned restaurant. The father cooks and the son and the mother serves."}
{"text":"Can't say enough positive things about Northeast Chinese. Have never had a bad dish, and the service is always fantastic. My friends and I love coming here. I agree with the previous order - the Fish in Chilli Oil and the Hot and Sour Soup are the clear winners for me. Also loved the Kung Pao Chicken. I look forward to every meal I have here."}
