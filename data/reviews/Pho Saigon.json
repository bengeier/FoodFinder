{"text":"The pho here is far from fresh.  I can't quite put my finger on it but the assorted meat in the 'assorted meat pho' was off.  The bbq pork tasted like plastic and the squid was emaciated looking and had a stale freezer burned taste.  Even the fish balls tasted like water.  All very off-putting.  Not very many egg noodles either.  I ate a sufficient amount ONLY because I was really hungry but I won't come back again.  I was going to order some bubble tea to go but I might venture 3 doors down."}
{"text":"I hate the fact that I have to right this review. I would do anything to not have more people learn about this gem so I can go there as much as I do and still not have to wait.  Okay, so the service isn't always the best, but who cares when the pho and the banh mi is beyond good. For all you vegetarians, they have the ultra elusive vegetable broth pho that tastes amazing and is always available. For everyone else, the rest of the pho is just as amazing with just the right amount of salt.  Now the banh mi. Holy Vietnamese sandwich! I've had it at a ton of places and this one is by far the best. Everything, including price, is so good.  Finally, don't go here so I can always get in with no wait. Thank you."}
{"text":"Ordered pho and spring rolls, waited nearly 30 minutes. Price was way too high for the quality and quantity. Broth was really salty and probably the least flavourful I've had. To top it off the service was lacking.  Would not recommend this place or go back again."}
{"text":"They have recently reduced the size of their menu.  It seems that they have removed some of their previous Thai selections.  Food quality and service is still good."}
{"text":"The pho broth was under par. I ordered the rare beef with tripe and only got a few peices of beef and 1 piece of tripe. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Great house special. Won't get the large again though. That thing was huge!  Looking forward to checking out more of the very thick menu."}
{"text":"We were a little weary when we stepped into this place. On a Sunday evening around 7. Only 2 tables were occupied. We ordered an xl brisket and tendon noodle soup and a grilled chicken vermicelli. Their prices are on the higher end of the spectrum compared to other viet places. Thumbs down for that.  The noodle soup was so so, the stock tasted salty and not very beefy. Pho here is just ordinary borderline below average.  The vermicelli dish here was the worst vermicelli dish I've ever had in my life. To be fair, the grilled chicken was well marinated, a little too salty for my liking but some may find it fine. The vermicelli noodle was partially cooked or else cooked but left out to dry. Half the noodles were dry and crunchy, and not in a good way.  I will never come back to this place. The only reason we walked in today was for convenience."}
{"text":"Under new ownership is a great improvement. Food is delicious and came out fast. The staff is very friendly and gave good reccommendations if you are having trouble deciding what to eat. Lindsay is very friendly. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Oxtail pho is awesome! Meat was tender and soft, slid right off the bone. The service was great, and Wednesdays is 50% off pho!"}
{"text":"The old owner was way more generous than the new management. Bigger portion and better food. I think I will move to Pho Fusion from now on. Their small portion is like a kid size meal."}
{"text":"One swallow doth not a summer make..  And analogously, collecting grease in a plastic wholesale Kikkoman bucket and boiling it with water doesn't make soup. This place has some of the oiliest and insipidly-flavored broth I've ever tasted in a Vietnamese restaurant.   And you know what? Reviewer Veronica O. wasn't lying, I too spotted the cockroach nest in the light fixtures, but rest assured, they're all dead. Well, at least the visible ones were; I can't account for what I didn't see.  But I did manage see some almost adorable \"mites\" in my water cups; yes, that's water cups plural, because the second one they brought had one inside. This place is infested, someone call the Men in Black.  So, make an informed decision as a modestly intelligent being and avoid this dive; likewise, don't start sentences with conjunctions like this old fool. Actually, twice the fool: one in grammatical style and again in eating at this dump."}
{"text":"Someone!Call the old owners! Another one has just bit the dust in my list. Do you remember the old owners and the friendly staff? It was one amazing place with an exceptional customer service and people who wanted to make it right. The food was so delicious but mostly we came for both- their people skills and great menu. The new owner has a funny way to deal with problems- to hide. Never called me back. I am not that important after all, I understand, whatever your name is, the ghostman Instead of friendly skilled girls waitresses we had ,now you have this little young moody thing at the counter who will get even with you if you dare to upset his inattentive unprofessional and unpleasant existence. He'll let you know he's upset by shoveling the dishes, talking back or not saying hello if you tell him he freaking made a mistake on a huge order and you had to drive back and forth to exchange, while kids were waiting and arguing with you. Do they apologize or offer to rectify it just as the old staff would? You wish! We gave them another chance a day later and it was a disaster. My child didn't get her smoothie because the little boy was in a bad mood. Now about the food. The kids used to love the chicken wings and fried rolls. The wings suddenly got smaller and way over fried.The fresh spring rolls were ok but the fried ones smelled like old oil. Yuk. You should cook with love, not with disgust or trying to get by. The soup is pretty much the same but if you know how it's pretty much precooked then you'll know its very difficult to screw it.    Good riddance and had fun loosing customers."}
{"text":"Normally i do not write reviews but i was so disappointed that i had to ask and use my girlfriends yelp account to express my feelings. We went inside the restaurant around 12:30pm and was pretty empty, maybe about 4-6 tables occupied.  We had a family of 6 and ordered with a young waitress.  We've waited about half hour and noticed it was odd that pho dishes could take this long so we asked when our food was coming and another waitress said it would be a couple of minutes.  We waited for another 15 mins and started to realize that the tables that came after us were getting served their food while we were still sitting and waiting for ours...this raised questions so i asked what seemed to be the more experienced waitress to look into our order and she confirmed that it would be a few more minutes.. As i continued to see dishes go out to other tables i thought to myself that this young and incompetent waitress probably lost our order somehow so i asked the waitress again to go and look to see if our order was even being made and in a minute she came back with the menu saying there is no order for us and who placed it.  We were extremely baffled that in the hour we waited, these waitresses did not have the common sense to check up on us and even the first time we asked them to check up on our order they did not tell us which means they didn't even check in the first place!! We got no apology from the manager as well as the young, incompetent waitress and we will never come back to this location.  Oh i also forgot to mention that 3 other tables left while we were waiting as they didn't have the patience we did.   I hope these asian restaurants can invest a little time to train their staff for a change. Also i found it very poor business practice to offer their sizes in medium large and x-large only,  what a money grab! Pathetic attempt."}
{"text":"Under new ownership, this pho restaurant became my favorite pho place! I have never written reviews about restaurants but this restaurant definitely deserves to get good rates. Their pho broth was absolutely much better than other pho restaurant's msg broth. I was so impressed. Also I highly recommend their Vietnamese sandwich. I don't want to talk much. Just try."}
{"text":"Seriously Best Pho in Town!  The eggrolls are to die for!  Service was excellent and all our food came out so quickly!  I will be stopping in next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Someone just placed a fraudulent order to my charge card and had it shipped to this restaurant! Shady! Wouldn't eat there with dishonest employees!"}
{"text":"one of the better pho places in york region.. they make an excellent pho and rice dishes. i go there like once a week.... my favourite is the porkchop w/steamed egg w/rice. they steam their egg with veggies and pork inside. is really good!"}
{"text":"It's all about the broth for me when it comes to Pho. Pho Saigon has it right. price is very good and their small bowl is big as other's large bowl. I'm not sure why they are not busier. I always try to stop by when I'm shopping at Greenland. No need to drive down further east on Spring mt.  this place is as good as any or better."}
{"text":"I come here often because of the food. The service is horrible. Everytime I come here I always have to ask for something i.e. water, utensils, fish sauce that's supposed to come with appetizers, tea etc. All they do is serve you the food and nothing exceptional about their service at all. With that said, I never tip due to the lack of service."}
{"text":"Not the best Pho, but it's the closest you can get without heading to toronto. I love their pho and noodle dishes. There thai dishes are decent but nothing compared to Red House just down the road."}
{"text":"Vegas has pretty good Pho all over the place, so I'm going to only rate their Bahn Mi and other sandwiches. Everyone rants and raves about Lees Sandwiches, but they have not been here. These are about twice the size, under $5. All fresh ingredients!! The only down side is that ordering over the phone is difficult as English is not their primary language."}
{"text":"Finally new management and cook is the real vietnamese lady who used to have her own Pho..long time ago and it was a Hit!!  The best pho , flavored perfectly . In las vegas...."}
{"text":"This place is extremely affordable and awesome especially the Pho."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I went to a pho place and they said they were out of pho soup. Wtf?!?! You're out of pho??? That's like Starbucks saying they're out of coffee. So effing ridiculous. GIVE ME THE OLD OWNERS BACK! These people are idiots running a business. Never setting foot here again."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho I have had! So full of flavor and for the price the portions are very generous! I ordered a small beef pho for lunch and was full for dinner!!  To top it off, the service is very good too something quite rare in most Asian eateries! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened I was so excited.  I love Vietnamese food.  It's one of the things I grew up enjoying.  I took my parents they were impressed by how authentic the food tasted and the quality of the ingredients.  Sadly over time I have seen the value go down.  This place was always on the pricier side when compared to those in Scarborough and Markham.  It seems every time I go (and it's less and less frequent), the price increases.  The portions certainly have not increased.  If anything, some of the items such as the pho have shrunk.  What I typically order with the family are the shrimp rolls, crispy rolls, vermicelli with grilled beef, rice with grilled chicken and pork chop, and chicken noodle soup.  I enjoy their rolls although the shrimp rolls are becoming ridiculously priced at nearly $10 for 4 rolls.  The crispy rolls have gotten smaller.  I good roll should have plenty of fillings.  The grilled meats have the standard lemongrass seasoning.  I enjoy the taste.  The portions have not changed too much although there was a short time where it was very much hit and miss.  The soup for their pho dishes are pretty good.  It's a bit on the greasy side.  If you plan to order them for take out just be aware that they use plastic containers which do not keep the soup hot.  They should be using thick styrofoam to insulate it.  As I mentioned earlier, I don't go as often any more.  Just when I want to fill a craving without having to drive too far.  I'm not sure how they remain in business because every time I go to order food the place is pretty empty."}
{"text":"THE BEST PHO EVER! They even steamed the bean sprouts so they'd soften quicker. The waitress Lindsay is very attentative. Also, best egg rolls ever!!! I get extra to go because the portion of pho is huge! Must  visit for sure. Inside is clean and updated from the previous owners. Very nice."}
{"text":"They opened about a month ago at the Victoria Terrace plaza.. Next to pizzaville. I am loving this place more and more than the Eglinton and warren location.   They have bigger portions and the food has more flavor.   The Pho soup is amazing! I haven't gone to the Eglinton and Warden for over a year because my last experience there was lack of flavor in the soup with high prices...  This location has the same menu but the flavor in the food is so much better! This will be my go-to place from now on and it's close to my place too!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership was a great improvement for a place we already enjoyed. The pho was delicious! Can't wait to come back and try more dishes. Friendly staff, Lindsey was a joy to be around."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Amazing food that never disappoints! It's very clean and the atmosphere is perfect!! Thanks Pho Saigon!"}
{"text":"Arrived here on a Saturday at 1:00 and it was packed! My boyfriend ordered a small rare beef, and I got a lemongrass beef vermicelli both of which were delicious. Although it might not look like much from the inside the staff was very attentive and welcoming and even checked up on a few times which is quite rare at vietnamese places. Be careful when ordering the sizes because the small was too much for my boyfriend to finish after having some spring rolls"}
{"text":"My Daughter's Favorite Restaurant. Pho Saigon - Pickering offers a  good sized portion of noodles to meat in their Pho. Pretty good broth. Have tried other dishes as well, Thai curries and their stews are tasty too."}
{"text":"Great pho! It's one of my favourite options for the food selection available in the area. I haven't tried anything other than the pho, as it seems to be what they are strongest for. Best to eat it there, but it also works extremely well for take out"}
{"text":"I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars. It was a good pho place, not amazing, but good. We had the pho dac biet, bun w/grilled pork, shredded pork, sausage and spring rolls, and the appetizer platter which had shrimp rice paper rolls, shredded pork rice paper rolls and fried spring rolls. The food was tasty but I found the dishes to be lacking in terms of how much meat there was. The shrimp rice paper rolls, for example, had very little shrimp in them. And my pork bun had only a few small pieces of grilled pork and a very thin sausage. What was there, however, was delicious. I just wish there had been more of it. They didn't hold back on the noodles though, so essentially we ate tons of noodles with a few pieces of meat. The price points were fairly standard and the service was quick and friendly. Compared to the many other pho places in Toronto, Markham, Scarborough, etc, this one was fairly average. However, given the lack of options in Newmarket, I'd say Pho Saigon is a good place for a great tasting (albeit skimpy) meal."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a few customers dining in and considerably quiet on a weekend evening.  The food arrived at our table quickly and our server looked after us.  I recommend the fresh spring rolls served with peanut sauce (these were eaten before I could take a photo).  I have been to their other location and the place generally has a larger dinner crowd."}
{"text":"I was just driving by Greenland supermarket and I noticed this place. Pho!!!; can't pass up an opportunity to try a new place out. I was the only one in the place and I thought ...bad sign. I had the special with flank, brisket, meat balls and other fatty parts. Yum! The broth was awesome with the right amount of salt. The meat was tender. The menu was pretty standard. I am going to have to try this place again soon. After my last experience at Pho So 1, this may just be the replacement. Vitnamese food rocks."}
{"text":"Love the soup here, never been disappointed. Appetizer plate with spring rolls and fresh rolls was great."}
{"text":"Solid. Nothing less. This place you get an amazing meal, with an amazing portion and a great price. There's not much in the way of Pho out east past Scarborough but this is just as good and in a good Durham area.   The extra large is actually quite a lot but still really good soup base. You get more than enough noodles and they do not cheap out on the meat. Had the house special and couldn't be happier.   I recommend the Vietnamese sausages to start. Good food"}
{"text":"We wanted pho for breakfast after arriving home the night before from a long day of flying.  Our usual places we frequented didn't open until 11.  Whomever gave this place only a three star rating must be a pho snob.  The staff were all very friendly and incredibly attentive to my young children.  The fresh spring rolls were stuffed fat and tight.  The pho was delicious.  The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"I was in the area visiting a friend and we were hungry so we decided to go grab some pho and ended up here. Friendly service when we walked in. We ordered the fresh rolls with shredded pork for start. I think there was a language barrier because the server thought we said shrimp and pork instead of shredded pork. However they were really nice and changed our dish to shredded pork. My friend ordered the tripe pho and I had the bun bo hue (spicy pork soup) and let me just tell you it was so bland with minimal meat. Extremely disappointed. Don't think I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and I thought it was quite good. Huge bowl of pho, had a decent amount of beef (much more than my \"regular\" pho place in texas). Everything seemed fresh. I will come back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH!!! If you cannot make your signature dish good then you should not be in business.  I tried their Pho Dac Biet and the soup had no pho soup taste at all.  The beef and the tripe were bland too.  All I can say it, make improvements.  I make better pho then this place, seriously.  The soup was very hot, that was the only good thing I have to say."}
{"text":"We ordered the rice plate and a pho.  The shredded pork skin on the rice plate is disgusting. It smells sour, tastes sour. It's not the vinegar sour or any good kinda sour. It's the sour that tells you it's bad! I have had the Vietnamese rice plate in many other Pho places and none of them taste like this. The female owner was nice, we could at least talk a little. The male owner came over and questioned us \"What's wrong\" and we told him the shredded pork skin tastes bad. He became really defensive and said its freshly made and that's how it tastes. He told us \"you don't know how this tastes like. This is pork skin, that's how it tastes\" in a pretty annoying, defensive, aggressive tone.  I don't feel being treated as a customer. I'm 100% sure the pork skin is bad.  The female owner came again and said it's made yesterday and maybe it was from freezer and still cold and blah blah blah. Well, two owners said different things. I conclude that bull*rap. Never eaten here again.  My Pho is just ok. Tastes like MSG broth. I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2 because the female owner was nice to us.  Note: The female owner is nice. Got us a side pork chop as a replacement. I just don't know how the male owner can be rude to customers."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Seattle and I've been looking for a good PHO place and it seems like in Vegas it's a hit or miss and finally I found a really good one where the staff actually smiles and their really nice not to mention if you are a PHO person like me they actually make sure your water is always refilled lol. Food here was very good and you can tell they actually want you to enjoy your food experience as well as your total experience. I give this place 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"This place is crowded,  that says a lot for its food.  I ordered the spring rolls,  they were fried to perfection.  I then ordered the rare beef pho,  the broth was delicious,  perfect pho stock.  As I was finishing my pho when I noticed something crawl out through the light fixture on the wall.  Yes it was a cockroach,  a momma cockroach.  It ran down and went under the table,  then a baby size cockroach crawled out running aimlessly through the wall,  and it was followed by three more roaches.  Yes the light fixture was their nest.   My bill came,  and I pointed at the roaches on the wall.  The waiter laughed and said sorry,  he said he would tell his boss.  I complained to the cashier too,  and they didn't think much of it.  She kept repeating the amount of my bill. I paid and jammed out of there.   Funny thing is,  that other patrons also saw the roaches and didn't react to them.  This is not ok!  I don't want Roach as one of the meats in my pho.  I'm picturing the restaurant closed after hours where the roaches walk all over the rims of the giant pho pots,  in and out of cooking surfaces,  through food prep areas. When the lights come on as the first employees walks in the door they all scatter,  I know they saw them,  but does anyone care?"}
{"text":"This is an unique landmark at a corner. Their Pho is yet the closest to the one I cook at home at a reasonable price. The nice ambient and decorations made me feel like a tour in South East Asia places. Absolutely recommended!"}
{"text":"This review is for the vermicelli noodles with the grilled pork, shrimp + egg rolls -- so far the best here than other places in Vegas. I also love their Vietnamese iced coffee, very strong just how I like it!"}
{"text":"I believe this place is brand new. It branches off from the other location at Warden/Eglinton, I do believe they have another location else where.  The only time I go to Pho Saigon is when I'm on lunch at work, and am craving Vietnamese food. If it were my own personal time, I wouldn't touch this place.  Pho Saigon isn't the worst, but it's not the best. It's honestly very in the middle for me.  With the wide array of super awesome Vietnamese food in the GTA, this one rids of the craving, but you could get better for the same price range.  There isn't much I have to say about the place. It's just regular Vietnamese food. If you're looking for something a little more tastier, I might suggest Pho Metro or my favourite one at Pacific Mall, Tam 168."}
{"text":"I used to come here maybe 2-3 a month. But now I am gonna be coming 2-3 times a week! I guess the place changed management and for the better. The pho recipe changed and now I think it's the best in Vegas hands down. I normally have to put extra fish sauce to my pho at any place I go but the flavor here is rich and perfect and not greasy so none is needed for the pho here! They remodeled and the place is a lot better looking and cleaner looking. All my friends that I've been taking here say it's the best and they love it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend after hearing about this All-You-Can-Eat deal going on Saturday's and Sundays. Availability is between 10:00A - 0300P at $12.99 and 0300P - 1000P at $14.99  Originally prior to coming, we had saw the menu for the AYCE that includes  Menu #1 - Sai Gon Pho, Vermicelli Beef Spicy Soup, Egg Roll (Cha Gio), Potstickers, Chicken Wings, Saigon Fried Rice, Spring Roll, Saigon Fried Noodle, and Dessert: Fruit & Cake  Menu #2 -  Bun Bo Hue, Beef Rice Noodle, Vietnamese Pancake (Banh Xeo), Saigon Fried Rice, Egg Roll (Cha Gio), Chicken Wings, Rice Flour Cake w/ Shrimp, Crab Rice Noodle, Saigon Fried Noodle, and Dessert: Fruit   Originally we were going to come here with another friend but he didn't wake up until we already started eating. Despite the spread of news by FB and what not, it doesn't seem like many people knew about this deal or had been doing this deal when we did.   Upon arrival, it took a minute or two till we were discovered and sat at a table on the side. The restaurant seemed to be \"Cramped\" due to the décor of many wooden fences to \"separate\" tables and hanging camping lights and the awnings on the side walls, in attempt to create an \"outdoor? Vietnam? feeling\". Lol. Horribly fail imo. The lady was nice with the limited but fairly decent English. She had told us we were not limited to a certain menu, and can order from both AND we were allowed to \"share\" orders AND recommended to order multiples of the \"appetizers\" due to length of time needed to cook each item.   We had ordered the Saigon Pho, Bun Bo Hue, 2 orders of potstickers, 3 orders of spring rolls, 3 orders of egg rolls, 1 Vietnamese pancake.   Bun Bo Hue had arrived before the Saigon Pho. Then came rolling in the potstickers with egg rolls, spring rolls, then last but not least, the Vietnamese pancake.   We had been told the noodle soups are generally smaller than the normal order. When it had arrived, yep they were smaller than the \"normal\" (from other restaurants). Bun Bo Hue included slices of meat (not raw/plain beef but similar to the ones that Vietnamese cuisine has in a roll. and a spear of similar meat but pork I believe. Doesn't bun bo hue have tomatoes and pig feet? Soup flavor was decent.   Spring rolls were small. Yeah it had shrimp but lacked some ingredients like pork slices, and some other herbs. The peanut sauce that came with it tasted a bit weird. Not like a \"went bad\" weird but like... iunoe. Bit different from the usual peanut butter hoisin sauce combination I usually get. Adding sriracha made it weirder. o_O ?   Egg rolls were long but about 1/2 the size of a normal egg roll. Potstickers were fried and seemed to have the same filing as an egg roll.   The Vietnamese pancake (banh xeo) was the size of a large plate. Yeah that's the \"normal\" ish size of one (though still smaller and thin) but definitely lacked in ingredients. The only things we had found inside the egg \"wrap\" was bean sprouts, and like 2-3 shrimp.   The lettuce that came with both the egg rolls and banh xeo was varying in size. So varying that it seemed some were from the outer layers, and some were from the very inner most layers. Not sure if this is something to be nit-picked about but hey... at least gimme a size that can fit the stuff im supposed to eat it with LOL  After we finished our food, the same lady came to recommend more things to order. Some on the menu (chicken wings, etc) and some not on the AYCE menu (bbq pork spring roll). We were quite full so opt'ed for dessert. Gave us 2 slices of watermelon per person. I mean, the watermelon was sweet, and she was seen eating it after she gave it to us too xD   Overall, I guess its good to try once. Maybe. I like viet foods but this is no where near the best ive had. Quite far from it. I had heard from my friend this place had changed owners a few times in the past year as well. For $13, its not a bad try if you can eat a decent amount.   This place used to be good because I used to call in to pre-order 2-3 lbs of bbq pork for making bun thit nuong at home. Not sure if they still do that but considering my experience this time around, maybe I shouldn't try."}
{"text":"So on top of the half off pho(would eat pho here anyways even without the special) the real MVP of this place is Do Anh!! That's her name. She's this nice old lady here can kick your ass.. literally. She was in the Vietnam War and was demonstrating how to shoot pistols and knocking people out. She's a good seller with her home made thai tea and iced coffee lol. But good hospitality. Great food and service thanks!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the price of $5.95 for a bowl of Pho!  DO order the Pho!  The sweet broth, the al-dente rice noodles, and the thinly sliced beef makes the taste Pho-antastic!    DON'T be disappointed that the raw beef comes out more cooked than expected.  Since the broth is pretty hot and beef is so thin, it practically cooks the beef well done while it's on its way out to your table.  DO order other items on the menu... I shared a BIG bowl of the Catfish soup with my dining companion.  Fresh catfish & fresh veggies served in a tamarind broth.  At the price of $14.95, it was enough to fill both of our stomachs!   DON'T be surprised if you find yourself thirsty.  I think they use the tamarind broth seasoning in their soup.   ...and DON'T forget to come after 3pm, some items only offered during dinnertime.   SERVICE: ***** [Friendly & FAST!] AMBIANCE: **** [Clean!!! ...except the bathrooms, but it's expected]    FOOD:  ***** [Wide variety of food choices at dinner time starting 3pm] PRICE:  [$5.95-$14.95]  OVERALL:  ***** [5-stars]  I'll be back! :-)  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Had Lunch here with my mom and it was really good ! Huge bowls of Pho !! Wish they had BBQ pork with Egg noodles but I had the rare steak with meatballs and rice noodles instead! Great value and the pot stickers were also very delicious! The young waitress is nice but a little dingy !! The owner was super nice and would visit again !!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted us to try this new place out.  And, I am glad that we did.  The restaurant is located kinda on the outskirts of Chinatown.  It is located within the Koreatown mall complex.  Unfortunately, there is not alot of activity within this mall.  We did not think it was a very good location to have a restaurant... kinda out of the way and kinda hidden. If you are facing the mall, it is on the right corner slot.  As you walk in, it is a pretty nice place.  However, there were not alot of patrons when we were there (granted it just opened).    The menu selection is huge.  We ordered a glass of water, thai tea, banh kho, bun bo hue, and pho dac biet.  Okay, the water tasted like bleach.  Yeah, it did not go over well.  Great thing is that I mentioned it to the manager and she gave me a free bottle of water instead.  That was very sweet of her.  The Thai Ice Tea was good.  Little bit too rich; however, I just poured more water to make it less powerful.  My favorite dish was the banh kho.  It is like patties topped with some fried onions, shrimp, and other spices.  You wrap this patty in lettuce, mince, herbs, etc.. and dip it into some fish sauce.  It was great.  Only issue was that they did not give us enough lettuce.  Wish they did.  The bun bo hue was okay.  It was not too spicy.  Such a shame!!  wish it was.  Also, I was disappointed that they did not have the pork feet.  Hey man, what can I say????  My wife tried the Pho Dac Biet.  She said it was good.  The broth was very tasty and better than most places.  As for service, they were really good.  Since we were the only ones in the restaurant, we had great service!  As for price, it was a bit more expensive than most vietnamese restaurants.  I guess they have to charge more because of the distance and less clients.    Overall, my wife and I really like this restaurant.  Service was excellent, food was not that bad ~ actually above average and good, and price was okay.  Personally, I think this is one of the better vietnamese restaurants in china town.  We would be back!  Thanks and enjoy"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want pho in Pickering. The service is always quick and friendly. They have very large portions in their noodle dishes and the broth is delicious."}
{"text":"We are visiting Vegas from California. Ate here for the 1st time last night. Food is great! Professional and friendly staff. The owners also stopped by our table to greet us. Lots of tables. Spacious and air conditioned. We were the last party to leave."}
{"text":"Was nothing special for being around so many competitors. Doesn't stand out, just another pho place."}
{"text":"good portions, great pho. would go here again. also the restaurant is very nice and wait staff are fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Been here once a few months ago and forgot to review this place because it didn't leave a lasting impression.  I give this place a 2 star for quality and authenticity of the Pho and give it 4 star for service. Hence my 3 star review.  I've been to Vietnam and have tried the real Pho and this is nowhere near it. There are other options around the area that is more authentic."}
{"text":"If you want to have something quick and cheap, this is place to be!!! Food is here is always consistent and clean, which is reason why this place is always packed with Vegas locals. I wish the reaturant could be updated a little though. As for must try, you gotta try Pho noodle in soup as the broth is amazing!!! Very comfortable place where you can go with your friends but don't plan to stay there for long time. It is eat the food and get out type of place."}
{"text":"I knew it was a good sign when I walked in and was the only non-asian to be seen. And indeed, Pho Saigon did not disappoint. Have I had better Pho? Maybe, or maybe not. This is just about as good as it gets. Fresh, authentic, delicious, and super cheap. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Moving here from California where the Vietnamese culture is huge and there's a different pho restaurant on every corner we had high standards when moving to Nevada. We have tried other restaurants like this since moving here and we're only satisfied with one so far and being that it was featured on Food Network we knew we wouldn't be disappointed however, this is our new favorite Vietnamese restaurant what's not to like the service was amazing the Thai tea with definitely traditional the Vietnamese coffee was the best I've ever had we had the foot long sandwich which was amazing everybody was an excitement in my mouth we also had the bus special and added meatball man where we impressed not only is this our favorite place in Nevada but it's definitely better than all the places we've tried in California - we understand this is under new ownership and we never tried it before but we will definitely keep coming back this is our new number one spot for Vietnamese sandwich and pho!"}
{"text":"Tried the Grilled Beef Pho here and it was delicious. Def would recommend it to any first timers coming here. Their Mango Salads are tasty and prepared/plated lovely.   It's a nice atmosphere and the staff are friendly and helpful. The cleanliness factor is off the charts, you could eat off the tables lol it's that clean!  Will be back here very soon. I am craving more lol!"}
{"text":"Unknown to me that new management had taken over.  My wife, father and I had a wonderful lunch today.  My Korean wife loves Pho.  I tasted her broth before she did and thought it was better than I have ever tasted. My wife then informed Lindsay that this place is better than before.  Wow I know what good Pho tastes like now."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pho Saigon since I got on the Vietnamese food kick several years ago.  Admittedly I don't branch out much beyond the rare beef and noodles but never once has it disappointed me.  This is comfort food to me.  Absolutely do not miss the fresh rolls, either.  They are fantastic."}
{"text":"I got the vegetable/tofu pho... and I was ordering it to-go... The broth is perfectly salted...they give you all the tasty sides and options for adding flavor... The lady at the desk was more than willing to offer suggestions and tell me what is popular.   LOVE IT! Prices were awesome too! 7.50 for a HUGE bowl of Pho"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is wrong. It's sad that the owners of this restaurant truly believe that their food is of some quality. But the truth of the matter is the food is some of the worst Vietnamese I've ever had in my life. Let's start with the disgusting fresh spring rolls. When I took a bite I notice no only did they put shredded lettuce ( YUCK ) inside of the spring roll, The lettuce was wilted and old.  The peanut sauce tasted sour and had a really odd funky taste to it like it was spoiled. By far the worst fresh spring rolls I've ever had in my life!   I ordered the combination pho dac biet which took forever to get to the table. Considering the restaurant wasn't even busy I found this to be odd.  Finally the pho arrived and tasted like a swamp of MSG. Again they tasted a funky sour taste - The food is off here for some reason. I took a few bites and push my bowl away. The pho was TERRIBLE. I went to pay my bill and the lady was on the phone the whole time. Very rude! Let's just say I will never return to this god awful joint! There are so many better pho/Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown."}
{"text":"2 things that are very important when dining out. Food taste and service. The food was very good but the slow pace and reluctance to serve us turned us off from this place. We went for the \" all u can eat\" special but apparently it's not all you can eat ? We could only order 1 order of each thing. The waitress stopped coming to our table and the last 2 items we requested were never served. The special is only on Saturday and Sunday's but when it came to desert which was fruit and cake apparently the only serve the cake on Sunday's ? And the fruit was one very small slice of watermelon per person. We left disappointed because we liked the food but since this was obviously not all u can eat but advertised that way it left a bad impression on us. Otherwise if we were only rating for food they would have received 4-5 stars but since the service wasn't up to par the max I could give is 3 stars."}
{"text":"We just drove by by accident. Very welcoming owner and really great Vietnamese food. We really lived the Pho, Bun Bo and the coffee.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I walked in the restaurant accidentally, but when I walked in I loved the place. I was greeted kindly by Diana, she automatically came with tea and was full of smiles. I loved the place because it was quiet. It became busy afterwards but it was a nice place to just relax and enjoy some good warm food.  The food was okay. I got a grilled chicken noodle soup. It came in a  very large bowl, enough for 3 to eat from it. The soup was good, but a little bit salty. The \"grilled\" chicken came on a different plate and it was a tad salty as well. I also ordered the number 8 ( fresh rolls w\ pork and shrimp). It was not very tasty but the peanut sauce made up for it.   Overall my experience here was comfortable and I enjoyed the food enough to come back."}
{"text":"We love eating here, food is delicious and portions are quite large. Service is friendly, nice atmosphere. Sometimes meals come out at different times depending on how many dishes you order but it's always hot and tasty. We like the noodle soups, vermicelli dishes, and fried tofu is so good. The bubble teas are good too!"}
{"text":"Great house special pho! Plenty of meat and noodles in the large size I ordered.  Broth was very flavourful.  Me and my wife were looking for a good pho place to replace our beloved PHO VIET NAM 999 in Oshawa and I think we found it.  The service was very fast and very friendly.  The restaurant itself was clean and comfortable. My wife ordered the chicken vermicelli bowl.  She shared a bite of the spring roll and I thought it was delicious!     I will be returning to this place to try the thai dishes!!"}
{"text":"Ordered for takeout. I had the pork fresh rolls as an app, rare beef pho for main (M) with Tom Yom broth. The portions for both were generous. The fresh rolls could have been a meal in themselves. As for flavour, they were a bit bland. They didn't have a good burst of fresh herbs that you expect. Really I could only taste the vermicelli noodles inside with the accompanying fish sauce.   The pho again was acceptable but not amazing. I could only eat half of the serving (m - which is the smallest it comes in). The take out included packages of fish sauce, hot sauce, Thai basil, bean sprouts to add to your beef and noodles. The broth was spicy, but at the same time not particularly flavorful.   All in all, a decent option if you are craving Vietnamese in Pickering but don't want to venture out too far."}
{"text":"This place is like home...a axing food and great service. The only Pho Resturant I will go to"}
{"text":"Just ate here an was not really impressed. First, my appetizer salad which is on the \"appetizer\" menu came out after my main course. Secondly, i was in decisive between two soup bowls and asked for a suggestion from the waitress... I chose the one she recommended but both of the soups came out. I told her i only wanted the one (especially cause i was eating alone) but she insisted i ordered both and that i had to pay for both. I'll chalk that up as a misunderstanding but the pho was very bland and to top it off, since i had ordered a spicy dish; all they did was make a normal pho and she added the hot sauce that was on our table to the bowl.. Weird!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is amazing. The pho and bahn-mi's were the best I've had in Las Vegas, the prices were great, and the girl who took my order, Lindsey, was so nice. This restaurant was more than worth the drive all the way from Henderson."}
{"text":"I usually order the large Pho Ga (chicken pho) or the #46 (vegetables+tofu with standard broth) and I appreciate the onion-y broth. Chopsticks and soup spoons in the table racks are clean, and the vegetables are aplenty in the #46. I like how fresh the bean sprout / herb / jalapeno plate looks when it comes out.  Have been back about 4 times and it is consistently good. Their tofu is always fresh. It probably helps the freshness quotient of a restaurant to be in the same shopping center as an Asian grocery store (Greenland Market).  A meal of pho only works when all the elements are in place. And here they are."}
{"text":"I was in he mood try new pho place out and what better idea then Pho Saigon since Greenland on my agenda picking up some rice. You first walk in nothing really special about the place like the decor although one stands out they do have two widescreen tvs (just happen last sunday night game got me some pho and football). The service is ok. They were very prompt getting my order but came too getting refill on soda took till empty and never checked up on me once got my meal.   Really talking about the food everything was very tasty, very reasonable price, and get lot of food. I started with asian salad with flank steak. The flank steak should reword it too teri beef (local style), The cut of meat was exactly the same style think slices of beef plus marinaded in teriyaki base or sauce. Honest I could have just had the teri beef over rice and be Happy camper! It was on salad greens. I not big on the whole salad part but wanted too try something new besides my pho plus I was starving. I did eat everything both salad and pho.  The pho order the #34 but its the one that has everything in it. Tendon, tripe, meatball, etc. I normally don't get the meatball because not big fan of it in my pho but love everything else. I like in tasting mood so like why not. I was happy I did. It nice small ball of bountiful of goodies. In every scoop get piece of eat different treat! The noodles perfectly cooked and the broth had nice flavor too it. I by far no expert on pho broth plus always put my siracha and hoisen in my broth. I always make point too taste the broth first. Me always good sign is the less put of both the better I feel the broth is. I really like the broth. All the vegetables nice fresh, crisp, and looks good.   Sure Pho Saigon place could see going back time and time again!"}
{"text":"their pho is pretty good here. not too overpowering on the broth and just enough noodles. i have yet to try their vermicelli noodles with the fish sauce. i ordered their bahn mi here once. they get their bread from sams club and that kinda ruined the whole taste and texture."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday at around 2pm. Had a bad feeling when the tea didn't come until we asked 15 minutes after sitting down. Took our order right away, but we had to wait more than half an hour for pho! The couple that came before us also left because it was taking way too long. All the servers seemed inexperienced? Two were rushing from table to table while one was taking her time clearing the bowls. Management obviously needs improvement. Taste is good though, portion size could be better."}
{"text":"Pho is good and the sandwiches are awesome (without jalapenos). I am now a regular. :) Oh & it's located right next to the Greenland supermarket, which is very convenient for me."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner. Wanted to try a bit of everything.  So we went for it....Pho was tasty veggies were crunchy. Ordered spring rolls and iced coffee they both came out timely and were delicious.  #71 was the  next item we tried bun. Yummy. The egg roll was nice and crispy and the shrimp was grilled just right.  Our final plate was a Banh mi..Korean BBQ on it. Bread was fresh and pickled vegetables were not overwhelming..perfect flavor to compliment the complex flavor of the BBQ meat. Needless to say we have enough for lunch tomorrow. The server was a nice lady very friendly and the overall appearance of the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"The pho here is pretty good. May not be the best I have ever had in my life, but it's pretty good. It's affordable and usually they are able to have your order out pretty quick. The spring rolls here have a special place in my heart. LOVE. They are amazing. Great with the peanut sauce.  I dont like the fish sauce, just because Im personally not a fan. It's pretty hard to find good Pho outside of Toronto, but this place gets the job done.  Oh, and inside is super casual, wait staff is very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Sadly, the Amazing Fresh Spring Rolls are no longer amazing Our last few visits there have confirmed this unfortunate fact. Oh well."}
{"text":"Ordered pho. Soup came hot and steamy which I enjoyed. Although it was a bit oily..and they cheaped out on the portion.  The pho sizes start from medium and I expected the portion to match the name but it didn't. Medium was more like small. But the price however matched its size perfectly-$8 for a medium.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Prices are great, portions big.  I am more inclined to order rice dishes here, because they just come with so much.  Sliced pork rice dish comes with 3 shrimps (yes I pluralized it) this egg/pork cake cube which is delicious, a lot of rice, 2 eggs on top of the rice, and pickled veggies.  Meat is not fatty (which happens all too often at Vietnamese restaurants) what a great place.  I'm surprised at the number of reviews less than 4.  Yes, maybe you aren't being greeted by a hostess (or anyone at all) but the prices are so low, what do you expect.    LOL @ Misti's review on this place... \"overfloweth\"  That was funny.  And the rest of the review is in normal English."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3 Service-2 Food-2 Strikeouts-0/3  This place is literally in the middle of plaza, and most people wouldn't even look here for Pho, but here it is! The first impression is a very shady restaurant with literally almost no customers. We were craving for some Pho, but the prices were much higher than other famous Pho places in the Scarborough area. It was literally 2-3 dollars higher per Pho bowl. However, after getting the food, you can tell from the size of the bowl, it's actually MUCH more than other places in terms of quantity of soup and noodles. However, that is pretty much it. The quality wasn't horrible, but you literally got scraps of meat that were so meager that I felt I was literally getting ripped off. That's the feeling. Yeah, they got a huge bowl with a huge bowl of noodles, but you need a balance. The soup base isn't that spectacular either. At least compensate the cost with a sizeable amount of meat. Not like 3 THIN slices of raw beef. I really wish I took a picture, but this was just embarrassing to all Pho places. If it wasn't for the quantity, I would just have given this place 1 star.  We came with a group of 15 people to try it out, and the above was the general consensus sadly."}
{"text":"This probably has to be by far the best pho restaurant I've been to. I've only been to this location though.   Love the atmosphere, it's quiet, and really nice and clean decor The service is decent, food came out at an average pace I would say, and the people there are nice and they come around to check if everything is good Now for the important part: fooooooood: The quality and the flavours of the pho soup is a lot better than the other  places I did reviews on. Portion sizes are pretty good, it fills you up. They are generous with the amount of ingredients in the soup. Not too much msg either. The quality of the noodles is probably one of my favourite things about it. Perfect size and texture. The flavours in the broth are really aromatic as well and very tasty.  Price is a little more than other places I've been to but I think it's worth it because you're getting a nice meal out of it.  I really hope they keep these standards too."}
{"text":"I'm fairly disappointed in this place, I wanted to try Bun Bo Hue for the first time and the picture on the menu showed a ton of goodies. However what I actually got seemed like only 2 pieces of meat; completely opposite of the picture.  The flavor was okay, a teensy bit spicy, enough to make my nose run. I didn't touch the lettuce that came with the Bun Bo Hue, it looked old and wilted...gross. To be honest I felt pretty ripped off because this bowl was like $7.75  My bf ordered a small bowl of pho which was decent and he also ordered the BBQ pork sandwich, it was pretty big for $4, a footlong I think it was but my bf was pretty pissed because he said all he tasted and saw was a bunch of lettuce and onions and very, VERY thinly sliced pork...   I also ordered the coconut smoothie which was ok.   Service was ok, they didn't talk much. The man however annoyed me a bit because he didn't even know what was on the menu! And when the food arrived he tapped the utensils as if we were dumb and didn't know where to get it. Rude much?  I don't think I will be coming back here when there's a billion other pho places that taste much better."}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant a 4 star but the soup was a bit greasy. My husband and I were driving by when I craved some pho and decided to stop by.   The restaurant is under new ownership and I can see that because they were doing some construction on the wall. They politely asked us if we minded but we didn't since we know it's difficult to stay open but do construction at the same time. Nonetheless, the restaurant was clean, staff was polite and seating was abundant.  The soup was delicious and full of flavor! I got the pho dac biet (pho special with everything in it) and it was full of flavor, a ton of noodles and lots of meat as well. Only downside like I said was it was a bit greasy that it coated my mouth. My husband got the Korean meat with broken rice and veggies and he liked it! The meat was cooked to perfection and the rice was just right. I also got the cafe su (which is coffee with condensed milk) and it comes with a mini French press like in Vietnam and you stir in your own condensed milk to your liking. If you're a coffee lover, this is PERFECT to indulge in once in a while!   All in all, we're coming back for sure to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks ago.  Familiar menu... great prices.  Good service.  Would come here again when in the area."}
{"text":"Been a big fan of this place for more than 2 years. It's so good we keep coming back. My boyfriend is the Pho connoisseur, he's eaten Pho all over the place and this is the place we both love!! Staff is very friendly, especially Lindsey. If you need anything she's right on it with a smile. My boyfriend usually orders 2 bowls of Pho, he has yet to decide which one is his favorite, he loves them all. I'll usually order fried rice, eggrolls and a vermicelli bowl. The food is fast, fresh and absolutely delicious. Will keep coming back again and again. Come down and try this restaurant. You'll be glad that you did!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. I'm not from Vegas, I'm from Reno, NV. I did some research and did my homework, & This place stood out because of its Pho oxtail Soup. The kids(waiters) were rude and didn't even knowledge me. They were all on their cell phones.  As I was seated. My waitress handed me the menu and as I begin to open it she replied with, do you know what you want. I asked to give me couple minutes. My waitress came back took my order 15 minutes later my meal was in front of me. I was disappointed in the ox tail soup for the fact that I paid $13 for two pieces of ox tail. But she was kind enough to bring me dessert. As I'm finishing up my meal Not The Dessert. My waitress forgot to bring me my Thai iced tea, & politely brings it over. I refuse to get it because I was full and she should have Brought it to me at the beginning of my meal. She began to give me attitude with the look of disappointment in her eyes like I did her wrong, like it was my fault . I got up pay my bill and walked out............. Highly recommend to go to other places besides this one. I try not to judge a book by cover but this Book was definitely disappointing..............!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Very bad pho. There are tons of other better joints on Spring Mountain!  Also, why is there only hand sanitizer in the bathroom and no soap? I also saw one of the servers rubbing her nose... alot.  I accidentally ordered the wrong thing, and my mother asked if i could change it. The server blatantly let out a huge sigh \"OK I GUESS\"... Rude. I was ok with keeping the order anyhow. Atleast an older woman came by and was kind enough to offer to exchange.  Dirty, not good. Not my cup of Pho. Pho-sho."}
{"text":"Been here for the second time today. As a Pho lover! This is one of my favorite pho restaurants in Vegas, I always order the combination beef soup, soup is very rich and flavorful size is more than generous, the owners are very friendly definitely going back again soon"}
{"text":"Good place, bowl had a lot of noodles and the broth was good. Good atmosphere and the family owners were very friendly."}
{"text":"love this place,  mom and pop operation,  prices are really low and food is always good,  this is not Americanized Asian food,  its American friendly, but its authentic 100%"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many many places across the entire US.  I can't think of a better meal anywhere with a price tag under $10.  And that's for the big bowl and a drink."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service.    The pho and the dumplings were the best I ever had.    The service was energetic and attentive."}
{"text":"Whenever I am sick all I want is a bowl of Pho hold the beef and add fried tofu. So very good. The broth is flavourful and not too oily. I have had better Pho before and I've had a lot worse but considering this is the only one in Pickering it's pretty good and we go here often, a few times a month sometimes weekly!  Veggie and pork spring rolls are both delicious as well, so crispy and flavourful. Staff are pretty friendly when we go there as well and takeout is super fast!"}
{"text":"One of the few places I know of that's outside the main city with good Pho. It's a frequently visited place for my wife and I. Always looking forward to eating here!"}
{"text":"Went here once for the pho, and ordered he large pho with rare beef. What I got was just a few measly beef slices, and a bowl filled with noodles. If I wanted to pay $11 for a bowl of noodles I might as well spent gas driving to chinatown for better pho. When I asked the waiter why there was such little beef, they said sorry that's the way we make it. So if you're looking for carb central by all means come to this place. If you're looking for good pho, I would suggest continuing your search elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice quiet spot for a good bowl of pho. Waitstaff was friendly and fast! Thanks pho Saigon!"}
{"text":"This is the only and truly good Pho restaurant at Las Vegas.  The portion is huge and the taste is too delicious.  You have to be a Vietnamese and Pho loving to tell the different between pho here and other place.  Bun bo Hue or Spicy Noodle Hue Style is very good here.  Mostly you find good Pho at Little Sai gon or San jose, CA but this place is taste even better than some Pho at Bay Areas.  The Soup is clear and the meat is tender and fresh. Goi cuon is delicious and the Smoothies are are too good for my kids.  This place is in Korean Town and far away from the Strip but it worth to drive a little far to have a good hot Pho after long night at the club or gambling table. Trust me, you will happy and satisfy for what you have here. I will only come here for pho for next Las Vegas visit."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Quick, good hot soup.  Very affordable."}
{"text":"Pho was amazing !!! Service was ok but service for drinks was quick . Entering the restaurant was more of a seat yourself type of restaurant. Didn't get a hello till our group sat down . It's was cool but random when we got chips and salsa . I thought we were at the wrong restaurant for a second . But it had like a home sweet home feel music was nice . Try the fresh coconut!!!!"}
{"text":"This Pho restaurant is what all the others need to be. Cheap, delicious and friendly.  $5.95 for a bowl of Pho Tai. Perfect price, delicious bowl. I used to be a Pho Kim Long faithful, since the days before they expanded and it was a rinky dink joint with a karaoke stage. But not anymore, Pho Kim Long is now subpar with increased prices on their food.  Pho Saigson is now the place to go."}
{"text":"Went to the Ajax location. The decor was wonderful - very modern and clean. We did a groupon here for $20 for two people which I felt was enough even though we went about 2.60 over. We had the deep fried spring rolls to start which were great! And then had two phos (1 beef ball and the other with rare beef and tripe). Both soups were great although we did feel they went skimpy on the tripe. But when brought up with server she went to the kitchen and brought more out to add to our soups at no extra charge! To end the meal off I decided to try their avocado smoothie and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I would def come here again!"}
{"text":"The food's good here, but a bowl of vermicelli and grilled chicken costs $12.95 here, while down the road at Pho Metro it only costs $9."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner because I was in the area for a meeting and my friend wanted to eat pho.   Honestly, the cost of the pho as well as dishes on the menu are on the steeper end, compared to other pho restaurants. I kind of had a higher expectation because of the cost but when I got my pho, it was just mediocre, nothing special. This restaurant uses dried noodles in their pho; I personally prefer fresh noodles. I consider the serving amount somewhat on the lighter side where I wished there's more noodles or toppings.   Service wise, the waitress was kind enough to bring more bean sprouts and tea when asked.   The restaurant was relatively quiet for a weekend... I don't know if that means anything about the business...  I will likely not return."}
{"text":"Was brought take away chicken pho. It was prob my least fave in this town that I've had thus far. Lacking in flavor with an off sweet taste. Needed to add loads of Tabasco. Threw away the chicken as that was off too.  Was told the place was dirty inside as well. There are so many fantastic Vietnamese places here that will prob give this one a miss in future."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was just okay.  I would come again.  I ordered the Beef Pho and Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"I came for their 50% pho special. Small mom & pop business, nice decoration, clean and very homey. We were greeted by a friendly old lady, very welcoming. A boy took our order and him and a woman delivered our food. The pho is good, honestly all pho is good to me. I cannot tell the difference but I do notice they have very little meat (well, maybe because it's 50% off). Certainly hope they will give more meat on full size order, I will try next time.  It's really a family business. Grandma greets the guests and refilling drinks, 2 boys taking order, mom and grandpa in the kitchen, dad was on his phone the whole time and I saw a little girl behind the desk. The plus, they played \"Michael Learns to Rock\" music, one of my favorite 80's band. no one here in U.S know them or ever play their music :( but these guys really big in Asia. They are European soft rock/pop rock band."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff. Good food. I know from other friends / family experience, stick with the soup :) My personal fav is the Grilled Beef noodle soup !!! (#55)"}
{"text":"I went in and had a chicken and rice dish, nothing special to be honest, I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants and the portion size wasn't that great here and nothing jumped out at me. The server was kind and polite. Overall 3 star for my experience is all I would give."}
{"text":"My gosh the broth had no flavour very bland and the pho noodles are a bit hard. I don't recommend eating at this location."}
{"text":"Okay, I understand this restaurant is in Vegas and not in Little Saigon. Nevertheless, I still expected decent Vietnamese food and service.  We had a table of 13 people and 2 kids. The waitress told us we can ONLY order soup entrees such as pho or bun bo hue. Someone from our table also ordered chicken wings, but it looked nothing like the picture of chicken wings displayed on the wall. The small order of pho was really lacking in flavor and noodles. I was still hungry after I ate everything!   Anyways, never again."}
{"text":"Pho is a great, cheap, filling meal and Pho Saigon is a great place to get it. Their menu is massive, offering numerous variations on classic Vietnamese noodle soup including an incredible House Special and also intriguing \"chicken pho\". Prices are cheap, quick service and a nice environment."}
{"text":"NOT THE BEST, BUT NOT THE WORST EITHER.  I came here to try their Pho without any expectations. I was starving, and Pho always hits the spot. I ordered a large bowl of their combination Pho (#1 on the menu), Cha Gio and Iced Vietnamese coffee.The coffee arrived first but was surprised, and a bit disappointed, it came premixed. I was hoping they would bring the Vietnamese coffee strainer and all. I wasn't impressed with the coffee. It didn't taste fresh. I suspect they brewed a big batch and mixed it up with condensed milk and refrigerated. It tasted like a stale coffee with crushed ice. The service was friendly and polite though. The lady took my order within quick minute I sat myself down.  However, it took them half an hour to serve the soup and the egg rolls considering the place wasn't busy/packed on a Sunday afternoon. I didn't complain for the long wait as I was watching the bus girl as she cleared, cleaned and sanitized the tables, and the older guy (maybe the owner) admonishing the cashier while he ate his lunch of rice noodles with sriracha and hoisin sauce and broth on the side.  My soup arrived, suprisingly, lukewarm. They were a bit stingy with their fresh herbs and bean sprouts. The herbs for my pho didn't come with \"culantro\", the jagged elongated green leaf. Even the herb accompaniment to my cha gio was lacking slices of cucumber, and had only 5 sticks each of pickled daikon and carrots, and just one lettuce leaf for 4 rolls. The accompanying nuoc cham was very watery, and to say the least, bland. I had to add a teaspoon of chili paste oil for extra kick. Though the soup came lukewarm, the broth was good.  It was beefy and rich but I didn't taste the subtle presence of star anise, cardamom and cinnamon.  I had to add a teaspoon of sambal olek and few drops of nam pla  and a drizzle of hoisin sauce to make it somewhat close to the broth I've tried and savored in the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.   Pho Saigon's was/is not as good as Los Angeles' Pho So 1, Seattle's Pho Bac, or Denver's Pho 79 or Fredericksburg, Virginia's South Vietnam House . I usually finish my pho, broth and all but this time, I left half of the broth.  The cha gio was smaller and thinner to what am accustomed to. I didn't taste the presence of the ground pork skin or the rat's ear mushrooms. To me, personally, it didn't taste like a Vietnamese cha gio. It tasted more, and if it was skinnier and longer, like Filipino lumpia. This is my first venture to Pho Saigon and though I wasn't that impressed, I am, for sure, going back for another try."}
{"text":"We use to go to Pho often in Pickering since their inception a couple of years agao but since they started to raise their prices we have stop going and will eat at other Pho restaurants when we are in Toronto, Markham Richmond Hill area.Overall the food quality, variety on the menu and customer service is good. If only they kept their prices around $5-6 a bowl for a medium. This would be more in line with the good cheaps eats for Pho in Toronto."}
{"text":"Just your average bowl of pho - nothing phenomenal or outstanding but ti wasn't bad either. The texture of the noodles were a little off/a bit stiff than what I like and my friend agreed. Both the broth and meat were decent too. The egg rolls here are pretty good though!  Service here was pretty good and pretty accommodating. Apparently, this place is under new ownership so the prices you see outside the store no longer apply (though I really wanted some cheap $5 pho...) so just so you don't fall under the temporary false advertisement. We came at a pretty odd time (around 4pm) but by the time we were leaving, people started coming so that was a good sign."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food & 5 stars for the service. I really love great customer service, who doesn't? The older gentlemen who served us was amazing. He made sure to always check his guest & get them whatever they need or more. We asked for extra bowl, he brings extra bowl plus spoons plus chopsticks... Just the extra step really hit the 5 star for me. The oxtail pho was amazing!!! The broth didn't need any extra sauce or siracha... It was delicious on its own. Sweet and flavorful. Next their fried rice was amaaaaaazing... I love that they added small chunks of Chinese sausage and cha lua (pork meat) plus shrimp... It tasted like mommas cooking mmmmm. The spring rolls were delicious. They had pickled veggies inside which made the flavor pop.   The restaurant interior was very nice as well. Very cute and cozy. I would defiantly be coming back :)"}
{"text":"walked in greeted right away. The place very nice and clean including the men's room. The chicken pho is really. service excellent very friendly. this is our new pho place.People on yelp come by here for pho"}
{"text":"Pho Saigon is the only Vietnamese restaurant I know of in Pickering and it's close enough to home to walk to if I really felt like it. It's been a while since I've been here and I've preferred some of the places I've been to in Scarborough and Markham.  On this visit, I decided to try the Thai green curry with chicken and vegetables. It was good but I would have preferred a thicker sauce. It had just the right amount of heat and the portion was just right.  The restaurant was clean and the service was good, although I had to walk up to the counter to pay the bill. I'll be back for pho whenever I don't feel like venturing too far from home."}
{"text":"I am tempted NOT to write a review of this place because I don't want other people to know about it. I love Vietnamese food and have been to almost every single place in Spring Valley. Most of them are decent, but sometimes you go and get a bad meal. This place I have literally been to 100+ times and have never had a bad meal. Only recently have I started eating their sandwiches and I'm sorry, but the size and taste of it can put any of their competitors to shame. For $4.50 you get a sub twice the size of those dinky little things over at Mr. Sandwich (which is also very good, but smaller). I love this place. It's always quiet, low key. Food is amazing. I will go here forever and forever be happy."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the service was even better. It was our first experience with Phò and we were pleased when the waitress helped us to make a decision worth eating  . We will be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim and we were very pleased the service was not the most outstanding but it was good for it being a young lady it's a family place and it's really good everything was so fresh and the pho was amazing they even made the lemonade fresh  We will definitely be back and Wednesday they have 50% of pho this place is a gem mom and pop"}
{"text":"I HATE hate writing bad reviews, however I do take my job as being elite seriously.  So when something changes on a place that I have reviewed in the past I feel an obligation to revise.  This place is under new ownership, I had no clue because we do not eat Pho in the summer.  We tried to phone in and found out they had a new menu.  So we went in, the reason it hurts to write is because the owner was so nice.  I it is nicely remodeled and cleaned.  It looks like they took a lot of time and care to turn this into a nice place.  We ordered our regular Phos to go and went home.  When we went to get ready to eat I noticed a huge difference in color then any other Pho I have had (and I have had a lot).  I continued to prepare or dinner.  There was a huge portion of meat for the Pho and lots of sides.  I added my sides went to the living room to eat.  It was not Pho atlases not a kind of Pho I have had before, it almost had a beef flavor.  It was also incredibly greasy, it was not good.  I will go back and try something else but I will not order the Pho again.  Because the owner was so nice I will give them a second chance on a different item."}
{"text":"I would go to Pho Saigon if I were absolutely desperate for a bowl of Pho and no other place was open.  Their broth is MSG laden and still taste ho hum which is quite sad and the quality of their meat is just as depressing.  Why not drive an extra 15 min west and hit Pho Vietnam?  Or better yet, you could drive to Pho Metro for the best Pho experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Nice and spacious inside  Wooden disposable chopsticks to eat pho? Thats a first Usually when eating pho the food arrives within a few minutes. Surprised that it took like 10 minutes for food to arrive and they were not even that busy. So the wait for food was longer than normal but acceptable.  Large pho with rare beef and tripe $9 - portion was quite large with a decent amount of meat. I found the rare beef to be a bit tough and chewy  Deep fried spring rolls $4.95 - super light crispy outer skin - loved it  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I came here looking for some traditional tasting Vietnamese Pho. I left feeling extremely satisfied.     Lindsay and Juan are very professional and on point with their service. I ordered the oxtail soup because other restaraunts usually don't carry that item on the menu. Make sure to get \"hanh yam,\" with your pho, it is extremely crucial. Mix some Siracha and Hoisin in that bad boy. My Oxtail pho came out almost right away.     BAM I take the first sip and it made me feel like I was sitting in Cali eating pho. THE FLAVOUR IS PERFECT. People dont understand the difference between beef PHO and Beef Stock taste.     MAJOR props to PHO SAIGON for keeping it \"REAL.\" I recommended their pho to everyone. Make sure you ask for Lindsay. She knows everything about Vietnamese food!! #DATPHOLYFE"}
{"text":"3.5 stars   I always start off with the egg rolls. The egg rolls at Pho Saigon tasted a bit off. I am a creature if habit so the Pho Tai was what I ordered. The broth was ok. The pho overall was nothing special and the noodle to beef ratio was decent. It was really hot in there for being the middle of July. I know who eats hot soup on a hot day, but it was so muggy in there that I was hot before I even got my pho.   I do have to say they are really efficient and quick at taking your order. After that service ceased to exist. Yes I understand it's not a five star restaurant, but waters were never refilled and no one came back to see if we needed anything else at all like extra napkins. I had to remind the lady that I had ordered an avocado smoothie (which was delicious btw). Overall, food is decent but service sucks (excuse my language). I don't come here regularly and I guess that's a good reason why."}
{"text":"Was good dollar value. And they had an actual selection of salad rolls. Green tea was served automatically and lots of vegetables with our noodles. Food was fresh & service was friendly."}
{"text":"I hope this place does well. This is about the 4th Vietnamese restaurant that opened here since it's inception. I call it the Death Corner. Previous restaurants have been good, but my theory is that the farther you move away from the strip, the higher the chance of failure.   This restaurant has all the right ingredients to make Vietnamese people happy. Good food. But that's just it, good food doesn't cut it when the majority of California Viets end up at Pho Kim Long because of proximity. What this place really need is a maitre d.   Anyways, trust me, this is a good Vietnamese restaurant if you want good food. Let's just leave it at that."}
{"text":"Tonight I called to place an order. But then I realized I had left my debit card with my boyfriend. So I called them back within 2 minutes, canceled my order, told her of my situation and how I would order online. She replied with \"okay, we are not busy\". I ordered from EAT24 because they already have my card information.   I drive 15 minutes from my place. Walk in.   Greet them stating \"hey I placed an order online\"   A man simply hands me a menu. Like he didn't hear what I said. I repeat myself. He looks at me and calls for someone in the back.   A woman comes out (the woman who I spoke to no longer than 20 minutes ago on the phone)   I repeat myself twice more. She says \"no we don't do that. We don't have that service.\"    I show her my confirmation number and order.   \"No we don't have that service there is nothing I can do to help you.\"    After about 5 more minutes of the same conversation. I get frustrated and walk out.   They clearly have the option to order online otherwise their restaurant wouldn't be signed up. But they did nothing to help me or solve this issue. Maybe it was the language barrier? I have no clue. Or communication issues between the staff and owners? Like honestly, I went out of my way to try this place and I was only greeted with confusion."}
{"text":"PUSHY AND DECEPTIVE ,THEN TRY TO MAKE YOU PAY EXTRA! Came here with my girlfriend and her 7- year old daughter on a Sunday for the all you can eat for 12.99 per person ( they charged her daughter 10.99 ) We read online that they had two menus, but upon arriving they handed us one menu that was missing many items that was supposed to be on the second menu.That made me a bit apprehensive, and while I was trying to decide if it was still worth it, an older Asian woman encouraged us to sit and asked us what we wanted to drink -I told her Thai tea, but she insisted on a different tea-she said it would be very good-so I went along with what she recommended. While we were looking over the menu (since it was not a buffet already laid out ) the woman again very strongly encouraged us to order two of anything so \" we wouldn't take all day\" . We ordered -as she insisted- two of each -egg rolls , chicken wings, potstickers, rice , and one bowl of pho. Everything we ordered was very small-usually just two or three pieces EXCEPT for the rice which was piled high on a big plate-enough to fill 5-6 people. After eating all of our food except for only being able to eat about a quarter of the rice plate,I asked for the check (since we were all stuffed) The woman then proceeded to tell me I had to finish eating the rice or I would be charged for another separate order. I thought she was joking, but she then said that I was wasting their food and I had to pay if I didn't eat it! Talk about cheap!! First of all they didn't even have all the items on the menu ( false advertising to get you inside) and then they don't have any food prepared (as in a buffet) then they PUSH you to order too much( I wanted to just try one of each thing at first in case I didn't like it) . Then they try to trick you by making you pay for whatever you can't eat!!? The woman said she told me when I ordered that I would have to pay extra if I didn't eat it all (TOTAL LIE!) Needless to say-I was angry and told her I wasn't paying extra-my total for three people for LUNCH was already $50 , and it was not good at all -then I am given a total con line that I would expect at the strip from a street criminal! I left no tip and will not return -BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and gave it try. Worst pho i ever had. Soup cloudy got me nervious at first. Then the taste test...total fail. Never had a tasteless pho ever. My kids refused after one spoon. The people that gave good review has no idea what a pho should taste like. Save your money and dont eat here."}
{"text":"I ordered pho to go and the soup tipped over in the bag as the guy brought it out so I asked him if it would be okay and he said yes. By the time I got home it had tipped over and all of the hot pho broth spilled in the plastic bag."}
{"text":"Efficient service, good portions, and authentic food! Not sure why anyone would give this place less than 4 stars to be honest. You can't really find a place that's exceptionally better, unless you went to Chinatown, but even still it's comparable!"}
{"text":"As hard as I am still trying to look for some good in this place, nothing is really clicking.  My galpal and I were greeted with a straight faced waitress who didn't look any less grumpy when we requested to be seated a little further inside the restaurant (she first directed us to a table by the entrance where people hustled and bustled alongside it and wanted more solitude). Sure, we let that slide and thanked her when we got to our seats - she responded by handing us our menu then asking what we wanted for drinks. Water and house tea, respectively. She rolled her eyes on us. After handing us our drinks a couple of minutes later, she abruptly asked if we were ready to order. We said we might need some more time to decide. She turned around looking unimpressed. After another 2 minutes, a male server asked us once again if we were ready. I didn't quite make up my mind yet so I had my galpal go first. We were beginning to wonder what the rush was. By the time I made my decision, I called up another one of the waiters who patiently got my order down while the previous 2 rushed around the restaurant. (Yes, we were attended to by 4 different servers tonight. Not something I always come across)   By the time our food arrived, we already savored enough of the environment to feel its unwelcoming vibes. The servers looked aloof and there was that uneasy quiet-ness to the restaurant that made us notice the flies buzzing around us. My order of the rice bowl (with grilled pork, 2 egg rolls and vegetables) would probably add up to a 3.5 stars. The pork was flavorful but nothing out of the ordinary, the egg rolls were dry and the vegetables were simply bland. I kind of wish I took the chance and waited in line for either Pho Kim Long or Pho So 1 just to get a taste of their better alternatives. My friend ordered vermicelli with an egg roll and reacted the same way to the food - tasteless and 'blah'   All in all, this place is getting a 2 stars simply because I had great company tonight. We managed to find humor in our situation and laughed it off but this rating is a heads-up for any of you who plan to come here. Explore your options because there are waaay better Vietnamese restaurants along Spring Mountain - Try, as I mentioned above, Pho So 1, Pho Kim Long or even Pho Huang - for the sake of your taste buds."}
{"text":"A pretty hefty price tag compared to other pho places, but they give you a plentiful amounts of noodles. I was pretty stuffed from their medium. Clean non-oily soup. Also tried their seasonal soft shell crabs....a very interesting dish I'd recommend everyone to try at least once. I was treated for this dinner so not sure how much that appetizer cost...  The restaurant is very clean, but they use disposable wooden chopsticks. It depends on everyone's preference. I prefer reusable ones, granted they are washed thoroughly."}
{"text":"Went to Pho Saigon on a weekday night with a buddy of mine.  Didn't really know what to expect as we are both Pho addicts from the Markham/Unionville area.  Was pleasantly surprised.  We both ordered the large house special Phos and their portions/price are about in tune with their Markham siblings.  The bowls had a large amount of noodles with a fair amount of meat mixed in and their broth was pretty good.  We also had a side order of shrimp spring rolls but found that they were pretty skimpy with the shrimp.  Overall a pretty good experience though and I have definitely found my new Pho den in Pickering!"}
{"text":"Great service. Good Pho is very hard to find north of Toronto, it's not the best pho I ve ever had but it definitely is the best pho I ve had north of the city. I go there all the time and I am always happy with it.  Their summer shrimp rolls with peanut sauce are very very good.  They really do have great service too"}
{"text":"Of all the Vietnamese restaurants in the area we always find ourselves coming here. We've been regulars for the past year.  We get the spring rolls, Pho Tai and usually a vermicelli dish when we get there. They had great smoothies but they're in the process of getting a new blender so we're looking forward to them being available again.  Our waitress, Lindsay, has been great and runs the place like a \"boss\"! We'll definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in Vegas so far!   I lived near the Vietnamese area on Washington in South Philly for a year so I'm a bit picky on the quality of food and speed of service. What can I say, high standards... This place met them for sure.   I ordered my normal bún with pork and spring rolls, and it was ahhhhmayyyyyzing. They went easy on the Thai basil which made me mega happy.   The service was friendly and fast. My Thai iced tea was great. Meal was cheap. I will definitely be back and already looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS LOCATION!!! They have a Thai menu along with the Vietnamese menu that is SO good that I haven't seen at other Pho Saigon locations.   Being a vegetarian, I haven't had all the dishes there, but my staples are the Vegetable Thai Green Curry with rice, Vegetarian spring rolls with vermicelli and the vegeterian pho (tofu, bokchoy, brocolli, onion)   The food there is very fresh and tasty, and you get a lot for your money. The service there is excellent. I go there very often and the staff there remember us and what we like to order.   The atmosphere is very clean and nice. Overall a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Under new management.     Two XLs for me and the lady.    I made my wife into a pho expert.    The following is her comment.    Beef broth not to salty.   Good flavor profile.   Noodles not soggy.  Perfect al dente.   Ice coffee strong as hell just the way she like it.     Rare beef tender.    Just the right amount.    Foot long Bah Mi with the patte'.     Nice to have a descent pho place near the house again."}
{"text":"This place was a major letdown. I wanted to try Viet food in Las Vegas cuz I miss it so badly. I'm originally from OC, so I was desperate for some good old fashion pho. Looking through yelp, I was surprised there were so many highly rated pho places.  So I decided to come here cuz it was close to my work place and had a decent amount of reviews. For the amount of food I ordered, it ended up costing me 40 bucks. For food that was NOTHING special in size or taste. I could get the same thing in OC for half that price! What a major rip off. The tai meat was hard and overcooked.  The noodles were overcooked, soft and gross.  The spring rolls were nothing special. The pho and drinks just took way too long to come. I mean come on, we were the only customers there! The service was just dreadful and slow, which made me grumpy cuz I was hungry. I'm just shocked because it looked like the owner/manager was Viet. Our Asian server didn't understand English OR Viet. So I wonder, why hire her? She even gave me the wrong change...didn't believe me until she typed into the calculator.  Which was so unnecessary, I already told her I just needed another quarter back....made the whole experience pretty bad for me. Based on this alone, I hesitate to try more Viet food in Vegas.."}
{"text":"We checked this place out because we were really hungry and had to go to Greenland... And ugh no bueno... It was pretty empty inside and yet it still took 5 minutes to get waters and another 5 minutes to take our orders...  We got springrolls, chicken pho & oxtail pho..  The springrolls were ok.. I thought it was so weird that they had shredded lettuce inside of them (see pic).. I've never had one like that it made them look cheap & weird.. The peanut sauce was pretty good though...  Then it took another 10 minutes for the pho to come out.. Which is pretty long for pho The chicken pho is not shredded chicken like how we like but weird tasting & fake looking chicken.. The oxtail was kind of dry & tasted old.. And the noodles were so over cooked that they kept breaking before I could get them into my mouth ... Lol  Also their little veggie plate that they give to accompany the pho ... Is so so sad looking.. It's like half the size of what other restaurants give.   With so many other options for pho in this city.. I probably won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Come here whenever were in the mood for some Pho and not willing to travel far. We always get their Beef and Meatball Noodle Soup. I can understand other reviewers that say their broth lacks flavour. Ive been to other Pho restaurants that have much tastier broth. But it's not that big of a deal for me so I know that going in. Aside from that, the food is very good. We highly recommend the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Boooooo! No soap in the one bathroom for employees and guests. Hand sanitizer doesn't count. Especially if it's used with water.  Went with gf and her mom. With only 5 other people in there they served the ladies  all their dishes while forgetting my pho 3 times.  Its just Pho. Not rocket science."}
{"text":"The owner was this very cute and spunky Vietnamese lady. Loved her energy and sense of enthusiasm. It wasn't the food that brought my attention, it was her honestly. My fiancé had a good laughter and enjoyed their AYCE menu. The ambiance really brought some memories of my parents hometown in the Philippines with the decor . Very much worth the money and trip. Only thing I wished they did was turn up the AC because the pho got me sweating you know. But overall thank you so much for the overall experience and joy I had during my first visit. Definitely a must!!"}
{"text":"My baby order Thai tea , I order ice coffee ... We ate pho rare steak & rice pork chop, both were good.... Good service as well."}
{"text":"I came back to try out the pho. They've been open a few weeks so I figured it would be a good time to visit as they get time to iron stuff out.   I liked their pho actually. The noodles were blanched properly and wasn't overcooked in the broth. It's a bit less spiced/sweet than Pho So 1 where I normally go but the broth was decent. It was plentiful with noodles and meat so it was pretty filling.   Not bad. It's another good work lunch option."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was okay. Didn't check to refill water. Had to ask for it. We put our spoons on the table and the owner put it back on the basket saying the table could be dirty. I understand she means well, but you should know if your tables are clean."}
{"text":"excellent customer service. food is awesome. i will difinitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic vietnamese food. highly satisfied."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night to an empty house for their all you can eat and I guess I took one for the AYCE team. Unlimited Vietnamese sounds great but when they remove 75% of the protein from what should exist in a certain dish, all you have is leafy vegetables, rice and rice based noodles.   The run down:  Fresh spring rolls: The highlight of the meal but nothing extra special, I think I ate 4 orders as each one actually had a full sized shrimp...and everything else on the menu was a bit of a let down.  Potstickers: They weren't potstickers but those cheap Sam's Club quality frozen and fried  wontons...nothing like the photo on their menu...I guess they ran out.  Saigon Fried Rice: AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. Menu says sausage, shrimp and chicken. A couple of pieces of tiny cubed sausage among egg mixed with a huge heap of fried rice and some diced carrots and cilantro. Super huge portion...super disappointing as it was completely void of shrimp AND chicken. The sign says anything left over is charged a la carte price, so when they heard we had ordered it, the owners must have been high-fiving in the kitchen that they could fill us with rice for $30.  Rice Flour Cake with Shrimp: So-so...a bit oily, it came recommended by the elder lady owner. My pic looks better than it was.  Egg Roll: Was a very long, thin spring roll, not that great...at all. My date thought it was old.  Vermicilli beef spicy soup: Had this twice as it was a soup on par with what you'd expect flavor wise with a good broth except for the fact that the meat was embarrassingly scarce. It also didn't come with any sides to spice it up to your liking (Jalapeno, lime, etc...).  Chicken wings: Have had better at a lunch time Chinese buffet.  Vietnamese pancake: Huge pancake dripping oil with oily drenched bean sprouts and only 2 pieces of shrimp in the whole thing. A joke.  Saigon Fried Noodle: They ran out  Crab rice noodles: They ran out  Fruit and Cake: They ran out  Other Gripes: -They claim to have 2 menus but most of menu #2 is just menu #1 written out in Vietnamese. -They actually brought out another plate of fried rice without asking after we forced ourselves to down the first...No way, back to the cocina w/ that! -Things weren't timed too well between courses, lots of unexpected down time. -If you are only going to have 8-9 items for all you can eat...don't be out of 3 of them!  How much is shrimp these days? I think I saw them for $3.99 a pound at La Bonita for medium sized last week which is the size they use...would an extra .20 worth of shrimp per dish beat the house if your two customers are already spending over $30 with tax and tip?  Overall I won't return. The options and execution left a lot to be desired. With them being so incredibly tight with the more expensive ingredients I bet they could have turned a profit charging $5 a head."}
{"text":"My dad loves this place...not really sure why.  I've been here a couple times...here's what I've had so far :  Pho Tai (Rare Beef plus Meatballs).  Not a big fan of their broth here...a bit bland and not very exciting.  It's not bad, just not very noteworthy in my book.  Oxtail Pho...not bad. Same broth, so again, not too much flavor really. The Oxtail was tender and tasty, but super fatty and not complimented with the broth IMO.  I like the Hawaiian style thicker/heavier/saltier broth to go with Oxtail myself.  Combination Banh Mi...this was pretty good! The sandwiches had lots of ingredients and flavor, and the bread was soft and tasty.  Recommended!  Vermicelli Noodle w/Grilled Pork, Shrimp, Sausage and Egg Rolls ($8.95). This was also good!  Lots of goodies in here, and everything was yummy.  I'd order this instead of the pho!  Che Ba Mau ($3): Coconut Milk, Red Bean, Mung Bean and Jelly. This is like a Vietnamese Halo Halo lol. It's very tasty...love the sweet coconut milk and red bean combination!  Yum  So it's a hit or miss kinda place for me.  Good luck!  Pics :"}
{"text":"I just can't say enough about this place. This place is incredible. The food is awesome. Prices are reasonable and you get more than enough.   The service is excellent.   If they are very busy, be patient, it is worth it."}
{"text":"My bowl overfloweth with vegetables, and for this, I am thankful! Yes, I have a special place in my stomach for pho spots that have a vegetable pho right there on the menu, and vegans listen up, they even have a pho with veggie broth on the menu! You don't have to try to explain to them what you want. They already have it!  I prefer the made with meat broth, but I like to see lots of green things floating around in there, and that is what Pho Saigon delivered to my table. I think my eyeballs popped out a little when I saw just how many vegetables were in there. It was hard to fit my spoon into the bowl between the celery, broccoli, carrots, bok choy and tofu.   The noodles were a good consistency, and the pho broth was solid. They brought out individual plates of the pho fixings, which I thought was a nice touch. The fixings looked pretty fresh. I also like that they have two size options. A small is always more than enough for me.   The service was very friendly.    Next time I want broccoli in my pho, this will be on my short list of options."}
{"text":"Nice owner.  She is nice and accomodating.  On occasion I bring order my Parents the vermicelli combo with shrimp and instead of grilled pork, chicken.  They love it.  My Mother is really picky since she is a Master chef, but she raved about the flavor.  My 20 min drive there is always worth the effort :)."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for 2 weeks staying on the strip for business and visited here 3+  time!!!  The Broth was amazing and I found my favorite to be the Oxtail Pho.  They get busy really fast so patience is a must, but boy is it worth it!!!! They are Family owned and operated and really nice.  If you are looking for something local and not \"strippy\" jump in a cab for 11 dollars or so and have great Pho and then a couple of drinks around the corner at the little bar in the strip mall : )"}
{"text":"I would never go here again.  Service was slow and we had to remind of our order multiple times. They would forget items. Egg rolls were the only good thing here.  Save yourself the trouble and go to another restaurant in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I took a friend here who has never had pho before. I kind of feel bad for picking this place but we were starving and we were in the area. The place was empty at dinner time and the staff was comfortably sitting and watching TV. Hello? Anybody home? At least they were watching \"Amazing Race\" which is a good show.  I was guiding my friend what to get and we told the server to give us a few minutes but she stood there the whole time. Suit yourself. We both had pho chin nam (well-done brisket and well-done flank steak). Compared to other pho restaurants, it took longer for the food to come...and we were the only people there.  The pho was a bit oily and was lacking in flavor...even after I added Sriracha. How sad. If only our stomachs could've waited 5 more minutes, we could've had much better pho in Chinatown."}
{"text":"They are so stingy with their air conditioner, after I finished with my noodles, my forehead and neck were dripping lol. The food was ok, I had to ask for a plate to eat my egg rolls/springrolls on and beg for a water refill, there are many pho restaurants here in Las Vegas, I will continue to look for one that is worth frequenting"}
{"text":"I used to come here often a few years ago and it wasn't bad but then they started getting new management and their broth changed. The broth seemed watered down or no flavour in general sadly. This is one of the few pho places in durham so its become pretty popular but that doesn't make it my favourite."}
{"text":"If u want to try a home made noodles with friendly family oriented staff .. This is the spot!!"}
{"text":"Great service, the waitress was very helpful in menu selection for a first-timer. The egg rolls are very flavourful, and nice and hot. The small rare beef, tripe, and noodle soup is enough to satisfy most appetites. It was my first time trying tripe, and it was very tasty, with a gentle texture."}
{"text":"This place is great! The customer service was top notch! It felt like I was eating at my grandmas house :)  The pho portions were nice and hefty and the flavor was pretty good! I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I came here only for a milkshake and after trying that I want to eat the food. I've never had a jackfruit milkshake until here.. it was really good! I can't explain the taste.. I would come back just for this."}
{"text":"Your standard place!  If ur in the mood for this style it's spot on but I wasn't blown away!  I'm a foodie!  So I'm like ugh next!"}
{"text":"Pho Saigon's location is quite conveniently located right by 401 and Pickering Town Centre.  The interior of the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated with an Asian theme... (Not too many Pho places can be described as such since a lot of them are like tables and chairs and that's it!)  Rare Beef and Tripes Pho M ($7) - Not too many beef...  ok.. not many as 4 thinly sliced beef... and a little tripes - Noodle is the dried type... not bad.. but I don't expect any fresh ones from any restaurant that not in Toronto...  - Broth is not bad... not too salty.. not too much MSG since I did not find myself been really thirsty even during my yoga class afterwards  Services here is efficient... I got my pho.. and they got my money...   I don't mind coming here for my Pho fix if I am in the area.. at least it is authentic Vietnamese and not some strange \"fusion\" Asian food!"}
{"text":"I have eaten pho in Texas, Michigan and Los Angeles. I am still looking for a favorite here in Vegas. I haven't found it yet. I ordered chicken pho (ga). The veggies were fresh and the chicken moist. The broth was okay. I had asked for extra veggies but received the regular amount. The hubby ordered the vermicelli plate. Viet Bistro is better."}
{"text":"Great taste! The price is reasonable (slightly higher than those in Scarborough), but the portion is good. It's definitely filling. Friendly staff as well. The décor seems a little out of date but  I like the overall quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food tastes the way perfume smells. Awful.  Shouldn't have to ask to order a drink more than once just to be charged triple for one drink and get it at the end of your meal. Then waiting 20+ minutes to get the bill after watching countless people around them get taken care of is ridiculous. Won't ever come back. What an awful place."}
{"text":"Located just off Yonge St. This is a great place to get your authentic Pho fix. The location is cozy and service was friendly. This your mom & pop shop family restaurant. My go-to is usually the smallPho dac biet (aka Pho Special) and a small order of fried spring rolls"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time while visiting Las Vegas.  Came in on a Thurs around 11:45AM.  +1 star, location is 15 mins from the strip and has a large eating area.  +1 star, service was quick and we had good spacing for our larger group.  -3 stars, we ordered five dishes total and all dishes were done poorly.  food was super bland with no taste.  both soup dishes had way too much MSG.  my dry white noodles was bad because the pork literally was like eating stale bread.   we will never be returning to this restaurant"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pho in Pickering.  Lots of selections, price is decent and the staff is nice.   Love coming here when it's a super cold day to Have a nice bowl of hot pho soup."}
{"text":"Good pho.  Like combination and oxtail phos.  Nice buns too.  Gr8 coffees and other drinks.  Service was good and quick.  French Vietnamese sandwiches are tasty too. Hearty portions.  Do not confuse with Pho Saigon 8 down the street."}
{"text":"24 hour pho joint! I wish that's all I really had to say and it would be the case if all pho places served it the same way.  I can safely say that the pho here is worth the trip off the strip.  The big bowls are pretty damn big, I should went with the small bowl.  The plus to getting the big bowl was that the server stole my bowl (infront of my friends like a ninja) while I was grabbing a to go container and they gave me a free big bowls worth to go for the inconvenience.  Plenty of seating for the lunch shift that we went with.  As always and as it should be, the wait time for the appetizers and the actual pho was less than 10 minutes.  If I'm in town and hankerin for some late night pho, which I was but my punk ass friends weren't feeling it at the time, I'm either forcing my way over or just go by myself."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find authentic Thai cuisine in TO and this restaurant hits the mark.  This hole in the wall place has excellent food, wide variety and great prices.  It is family owned and operated and has delicious fresh Thai food.  Service is friendly and quick, restaurant is clean and décor forgettable.  You will not be disappointed if you stop in."}
{"text":"The food is authentic vietnamese with reasonable price. This is not the inflated Vegas Strip prices with small portion. Come here if you are part of the Viet family looking for good cafe sua da and Pho."}
{"text":"In every town I have ever lived in, there has always been a war going on between Pho restaurant owners.    When I lived in San Diego, some of the owners of Pho establishments figured out how to bypass the Yelp Filter by going WAY out of their way to take the proper steps. I mean, they would clear their cookies, register their accounts at the public library(for IP address reasons),  make tons of friends, invest their time into writing one detailed 4-star review per day for 30 days, and then when the filter believed that they were real people they would write a libelous review about their enemy.  These fraudulent reviews usually looked something like: \"I got food poisoning here last night. The owner stole my credit card number and bought Burberry with it. The health inspector came in while I was eating and shut the place down. The cooks are Mexican! The owner isn't Vietnamese he is Filipino! There were cockroaches in my Pho, I ordered the rare steak pho without cockroaches but I got them anyway!  The srirachi sauce was actually aids blood.  I was molested by the owner when I went to the bathroom\".  And when I lived in Los Angeles county, Pho restaurant workers used to vandalize competing restaurants, and they would always get into physical altercations in public when they would run into each other. There is a lot of politics and backstabbing in the Pho business. What many people don't know is that frequently one Pho restaurant will be started by a group of Vietnamese immigrants, then one member of the group will betray the others by breaking away and making his own restaurant. This is usually the root of the hostility. The moral of my story is that one of the main reasons all the Pho joints on Yelp average a 2 1/2 star rating is because of these \"Pho Wars\".  So don't go on Yelp to try and find a good Pho place. Just run around town and try various places. See which ones you like and decide for yourself.   PHO SAIGON is one of the better Pho places I have been to in town. The broth is oily and clear. The steak is bloody and tender.  They pack your broth with sliced green onions. And the store has a good location.. it's located in the same center as Greenland and my personal favorite restaurant: Sushi on Rainbow!    The Pho at PHO SAIGON is actually really good. Pho is a simple dish to me, it doesn't have the complexities that Ramen has. I personally believe that Pho is Ramen's inbred twin brother.  PHO SAIGON does a great job at presenting a Pho which is quite typical of what you would find at popular douchebag hangouts such as Pho Kim Long and Pho So 1.  The reason I like PHO SAIGON better than Pho Kim Long and Pho So 1 is because you(the reader) sucks, and you eat there. I don't want to eat there and completely suck with you. No one wants to suck, right? So come to PHO SAIGON and be \"cool\" like me.  I support all Asian-American businesses so this place gets 5-stars by default."}
{"text":"Interesting to I must say.. had a couple of first.  Had Durian smoothie and friend had Jackfruit the durian was not to my liking but I can say I triied it.   Fresh rolls or ( spring rolls ), foot long sandwich with Korean beef was mine and friend had the pho' with steak flank.   The spring rolls really good though I was missing basil ? I have been to a couple of pho places that put basil in them tastes really great that way, however can tell there really fresh. The Korean Beef Sandwich was really good I have a few suggestions though its hard to eat cilantro as a whole with stem attached maybe they could pick apart or chop also the cucumbers instead of slicing them on a bias maybe try julienne them this would look really cool to match the carrots they have its kinda hard biting into a amazing baguette and have to chew for five minutes with out chocking. The Korean beef was flavorful and tasted yummy.   The pho looked amazing I also seen some pho dishes that looked like crispy beef or chitlins ? maybe next try that. The bread was amazing normally I dont get excited bout that but have had some bad experiences in the past either soggy bread or worse   Overall ok"}
{"text":"I always come here for authentic Vietnamese food when I'm in Vegas. I live in the OC, Little Saigon, so know good Vietnamese food when I see it. This place has reasonable prices and great food. My family usually gets pho...can't go wrong with that or the com tam (broken rice) As for myself? I'm a Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (grilled pork and egg roll vermicelli) kind of girl. I ask them to hold the Bun (vermicelli) tho = less carbs.   The service is decent, not great but not poor either. I've never had a problem with the service. I guess they could be a little more friendly, but let me ask you this. If you are a shy, introverted person and that's how you've been all your life, do you think it's hard to change? This is how the owners are and their workers are pretty much the same in how I observed. But it's not going to stop you in making the best Vietnamese food outside of Vietnam and Little Saigon now huh?   I'm still going to go back to this place even though it's a little bit off the strip and away from the other thousand pho places along Spring Mountain.  5 stars is for the food!"}
