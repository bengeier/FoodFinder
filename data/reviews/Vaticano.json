{"text":"I'm HUGE on service, having said that, if your product/ food is delightful, but your service distasteful, it will without a doubt translate onto the plate you serve me.
These are some of the most doleful looking waiters I've ever met. They genuinely look and act as though you are a telemarketer they want to brush off as quickly as possible. No, like I literally mean they MARATHON away from you as quickly as possible, as if to avoid communication and questions. (What the hell service is that?)
Aside from the servers, this place is great (for the food). The kitchen seems to be trying to make up for the blues permeating in the dining room. Rich quality in the dishes, the freshness and flavours are satisfying by anyone's standards. The Caesar salad was scrumptious! There was not an unturned, underdressed piece of perfectly bite-sized piece of romaine lettuce in my bowl. Creamy as it gets, they are not sparse with that dressing. The pasta is so fresh, and so nice. Perfectly cooked each time. Perfectly seasoned too. MmMmmmMmmmm!
Note: Their lasagna was not that great...don't order it. Do yourself a favor and order one of their special pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Service was just average.  I had the penne cleopatra which is pasta with salmon in a rose sauce. It was very good but don't expect a large piece of salmon as the salmon is intermingled with the pasta in small bits.  My friend had the Vittello Marsala and really enjoyed it.  We did not have dessert as we were completely full after our meals (large portions).  We would come back as the food was good, but the three stars are for average service."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Vaticano's for the Summerlicious menu.  They called to confirm our reservations about 2 hours prior to our actual reservation which I thought was odd.  I had ordered the Caesar salad, veal chop and apple crumble.  The Caesar salad was good, the veal chop was very big and delicious (though it came with no side just some vegetables underneath it).  I like to have pasta with my veal so I ordered a side plate of penne in a rose sauce.  The pasta was not served at the same time as the veal and when I did get it was not even cooked al dente, not even warm and definitely not worth the $7 I paid for it.  The apple crumble was truly a disappointment as it looked like something you can get from M&M's, the grocery store or Chudleigh's farm.  I expected homemade apple crumble!
My friend ordered the mussels, the pan-seared fillet of bass and the mixed berry cheesecake.  The mussels were good as well as the cheesecake but the bass was served and there were still bones in it that my friend had to pick out!!!
The service was exceptional (although it seemed we didn't have one specific waiter but many).  
By looking at the restaurant online I expected much more.  It was ok but nothing I would particularly rave about."}
{"text":"We went there for Winterlicious and it was divine!We had the mussels, soooo yummy followed by the salsicce and rapini, pesto gnocchi and breaded veal chop, dessert was panna cotta, cheese cake and biscuits! Nothing short of wonderful, amazing and tasty! Kudos to the chef and kitchen staff! Great selection 

From the moment I made reservations to when we arrived the staff was welcoming, accommodating and professional and a plus they all spoke some Italian...nice touch!! The bartender that made my Seabreeze was so sweet, she was so patient with my order and above all this took place on Super Bowl Sunday. Such awesome service too bad Barbarians steak house can't take pointers from you all!! 

Thank you for a wonderful evening!! Salute!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the summerlicious lunch menu. I thought the food was tasty and decor is decent. Will go there again."}
{"text":"Always the best meals here! Best service! And very accommodating!! The veal scaloppine, whole fish and caprese salad are my favorite dishes!"}
{"text":"My favourite Italian place close to Bay Street Subway Station - West Exit.
Has a quiet sunken patio in summer. Service is crisp, food excellent. Has a bar if you are dining alone and do not want to sit at a table.
Warm atmosphere in winter."}
{"text":"A very disappointing experience. Our entire group agreed that the food was only average and over priced given the many alternatives both in the neighbourhood and in the city. Overpriced with poor service (forgot two dishes, didn't bring two drinks, overworked staff.)"}
{"text":"The place is really nice and cozy. It is one of the best places to go for a date. The veal scaloppini is amazing. I also tried the sea food linguini but it wasn't that great. The staff are very friendly but they can be clumsy."}
{"text":"I have been to this Italian restaurant many times and I have never been disappointed. If your tummy is craving a delicious homemade pasta, then this place delivers wat it promises. Their tomato sauce is to die for. I am a pasta lover and i have tried so many places and this one is one of my favs. Their prices are a little on the high end but the food is delicious, the area is perfect for a nice walk ( unless its -30 outside lol) , the restaurant itself has a romantic feel so it would be perfect for a special occasion. You are looking at spending $70-80 between two people. Service i would say is average, nothing special.


oh before i forget: The portion is big! No need in searching your fridge as soon as u arrive home!"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a solid 4 stars. Had a very short time in Toronto and had a craving for Italian food. Overwhelmed by our choices in the area but this one came recommended by a friend. From the start we had a great experience, the hostess was nice, our waiter Mo was the best, very engaging and it was nice to see the owner and his family sitting in a corner enjoying a meal. We shared a cheese and meat platter for one and there was more than enough food there for us to start. We both had pasta dishes which I can't name for fear of spelling them wrong, they were both a little salty but with that said still very good. The homemade pasta was excellent. Would definitely return! Not sure why there are not more stars for this place.. Oh and on a side note, the party at our neighboring table ordered pizza, thin crust and looked amazing!"}
{"text":"This is our neighbourhood favourite.  We have always had a great meal when we've gone here.  

They have a quaint patio in the summer and nice atmosphere inside, with service being excellent no matter where seated.

Everything we've had on the menu has been excellent with the beef carpaccio being one of our personal favourites.  The tiramisu and panna cotta are both a great way to finish off a meal with an espresso."}
{"text":"WARNING!! DO NOT EAT HERE!! It is a HUGE rip off!!!! The service is absolutely terrible!!! Do not be fooled by it's convenient location. 
My friend organized his birthday here and set a $60 per person menu. This was to include an appetizer, main, dessert and coffee. The appetizer was a plate of 3 slices of prosciutto, 3 slices of bocconcini, 2 pieces of grilled pepper and a handful of salad...to be SHARED amongst 4 PEOPLE! The main was a plate of pasta or meat which was fine (they didn't take the order for our main until 30 minutes after we finished the pathetic excuse for an appetizer. Dessert was pretty much the same as the appetizer. 3 tiny slices of cake to be shared amongst 4 people (there were 12 people in total). The coffee was made using USED coffee grounds. Then the bill comes, and somehow the total per person comes to $95!!!! Tip was included in the origional amount so I don't know where the extra $35 came from! And there was no booze had that night. I left feeling robbed and taken advantage of. Never go here!!! EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"Serves food until midnight. The restaurant is down a set of stairs in Yorkville. Amazing melanzane parmigiana and pasta dishes. With a side of Perroni my night is made. I have also tried the daily soups . The mushroom and minestrone were great. Bellisimo. Nervosa is their local competitor. Waiters at Nervosa seem distracted. Vaticano waiters are the opposite. Perhaps too efficient but a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Classic Italian food. Recently went for a business lunch and everything was great. The lasagna was perfect and my lunch partner was very happy with her Chicken. Would recommend easily to friends."}
{"text":"Found this place while walking in Yorkville on a drizzly, mild Monday around noon.  Skimmed the menu outside and the $18.95 lunch specials looked good, so my partner and I decided to check it out.  Nice romantic, cozy atmosphere, with a few separate rooms, traditional Italian decor, many tables, a wine cellar, and private bathrooms decorated the same as the dining areas.  Photos of the chef with many celebrities who have dined here is a fun touch.  (although somewhat common in the neighborhood).  The restaurant itself is on the lower level of the street, down a few steps, and I am not sure if there is a ramp for accessibility.  We were greeted right away by a friendly male server who was prompt throughout the meal, friendly without being too chatty.  The Caesar salads were good (without bacon) and the pesto fusilli was delicious.  We both had the same dishes as the lunch special, but I'd love to go back and try a few of their other choices.  Their regular menu looks great too, with tons of italian choices, and a huge wine selection.  I'd love to come back here."}
{"text":"I came here for the fish (it's the Pesce del Giorno - I went for the bass), and it was delicious. I also had a red pepper appetizer that was very tasty... The seafood blend I shared was less noteworthy. 

I think that the food here depends on what you order, and perhaps I got lucky. But it was still very tasty, so I will give credit where due. The service was fair, and the atmosphere is very cliche-romantic (pillars, dark red curtains, etc), but in a nice way. A good place to set the mood for a date, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a not a place to go. Food does not worth the price. It is a real rip off while the courses are not even tasty. It's all about salt. Toronto has other places to go."}
{"text":"Went on a pleasant Sunday evening, wanted a nice place for pasta in Yorkville. Got a table for two without a wait. The bread could have been better, it was served slightly warm and didn't feel too fresh. The pasta came in a reasonable amount of time, and tasted great. Our waiter was friendly and attentive as well. Overall, was bit pricey and nothing too amazing, but it was a nice meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Yorkville. Good for a lunch or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"This was a bit of a disappointment, considering its location and the price point.

Our bill for 2 came to $180 plus tip (2 entrees, 2 appetizers, and a bottle of wine). Now, for that price I expect excellence. Instead we got mediocracy.

Service was fine, but nothing to write home about. I could have used more water, but never got a refill. 

The food is mixed. I will say that the grilled calamari ($16) was delicious! The beef carpaccio ($18) was good. Both were big portions. The bread was tasty, but the butter/dip was basically just pureed garlic -- it was crazy strong!

Then the mains came. We both got a veal dish, and they tasted similar (both about $25 each). Mine was VERY salty, which really overpowered the taste of the meat. The side portion of vegetables was pathetic. I got 1/8 of a potato (literally, 2 bites), 1 broccoli, and a few slices of red papers and zucchini. The vegetables were all lukewarm. 

I think you could do a whole lot more for $180 bucks. I usually don't go to these types of high-end restaurants (cause I'm a value hunter!), but my sense is that there are better Italian options in the area. 

DIsclaimer: I'm Italian and love Italian food!"}
{"text":"I have high expectations for restaurants in Yorkville as it's one of the most high end areas in Toronto. Unfortunately Vaticano was pretty disappointing.

As a starter the bread came in as complimentary, however the bread was awful! It was hard, not tasty, and the butter was hard as well.

We then had their pizza. We made our own pizza with, instead with pollo we made it with veal. The pizza was probably the best part of the meal.. A solid 3.5/5.

I then had the spaghetti bologonese. It was good but nothing special. It tasted like a pasta I would have at any other restaraunt, not a high end Italian restaraunt.

I then finished my meal with a chocolate cake. It was super chocolaty, which I love. I just wish it had better texture, taste was good, but it felt a bit cheap to me... Kind of like it was a premade food.

The service was horrendous, I had to ask my water to be filled constantly. We had to call our server each time we wanted to order something. Usually at fine dining experiences, the service is much much better. The server was nice, but he just was never there.

Overall I wouldn't recommend this place. It was the same quality as scaddbush but more pricey. I'd save money and go to scaddbush instead"}
{"text":"$$$ but had good service great food I had Veal Parm. with Eggplant and side veggies I ate the whole thing & others at table enjoyed their meals, no complaints for a picky crowd :) We had a table beside the window, it was dim & candle lit, nice atmosphere ...if it wasn't so $$ I'd make it a regular place...fresh and yummy, oh yes and the wine list is fantastic."}
{"text":"excellent staff. wonderful atmosphere. best food in Toronto! Personally, my favourite is their gnocchi"}
{"text":"Vaticano is one of our top go-to Italian restaurants in Toronto. I've been here quite a few times and the service is always on point - fast and friendly.  

It's in a great location and the space is good with a few different options for seating; in nice weather you can sit outside on the small patio. 

The food is very good, fresh and well prepared.  For starters, the beef carpaccio is awesome and the grilled octopus is really good too. 

Where Vaticano really shines is their home made sauces - their tomato sauce and their vodka sauce is incredible.  Try the Chicken Parmesan with a side of Angel Hair pasta to experience the tomato sauce.  Or if you're in the mood for the Vodka Sauce, get the Penne Cleopatra which is served with fresh salmon. 

I recommended this place for a good meal at a pretty good price."}
{"text":"I've dined here twice for dinner and both times were fantastic. The second time was accompanied by a live Italian singer which really added to the ambience. My five star rating is based solely on the fact that they allowed me to order penne a la vodka even though it wasn't on the menu and it was seriously amazing!! My husband's dish was also incredible -  some sort of veal dish with mushroom sauce. The melon/prosciutto appetizer would have been better if the melon was softer. Hope to try dessert next time."}
{"text":"I had gone a few years ago and loved it, I decided to come back a few weeks ago and I hated I! It is way too overpriced, it is not clean and they didn't have ricotta cheese! The food was definitely below average as well as the service, I believe it is now under new ownership and that's why it has gone down. I really would not recommend this restaurant, the brushetta was terrible, the bread was stale and the brushetta was clearly frozen! Awful food."}
{"text":"I wish someone would have warned us that there was construction going on basically inside the restaurant (that's how loud it was) because it would have saved us the $80 for a crappy lunch altogether. Not to mention, the hostess chose to seat us right behind a party of 15 in an almost otherwise empty restaurant so between this and the construction, we had to ask to move. 

We went for the winterlicious menu which sounded good and affordable (app, entree and dessert for $28 each). The portions were just about the only thing good about it though as the food was off tasting and bland. The service was hesitant (our waiter seemed scared to talk to us) and slow but at least he was friendly... I couldn't even understand one of the waiters because his accent was so strong so I had to just nod and smile a few times. I will say that the tomato sauce was fresh and delicious though... it made me want to eat all of the free bread.

The regular menu seems rather expensive so I likely wouldn't take my chances and eat here again... nonna probably wouldn't approve anyway."}
{"text":"Just okay - decor, service, food.

Soup that was slapped all over the plate, server was hardly at ease bringing the plates to the table.  Asking repeatedly for bread or wine or water.  Nothing we had was memorable, at least positively.  Wine by the glass was poor - again nothing special.  Hey if I am paying for Italian food I expect somewhat Italian staff - they were all Indian (nothing against Indians) not what I expected.

I have now been here twice and had the same experience.  Not worth a mild recommendation for a starving man."}
{"text":"I'll give this place one thing: the food is delicious. Everything else... well... not so great. Service was indifferent and the restaurant's decor was cheesier than all the bufala mozzarella in Campana. (The chef's picture on the restaurant signs! The celebrity photos up front!  And the murals! OMG, the murals! I half expected \"Decor by Carmela Soprano\" business cards by the door.) 

But, if you can ignore the Olive Garden-Meets-Buca-di-Beppo-esque decor and the standoffish service, then chances are you're in for a pretty good meal. My pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, with a rich rose cream sauce. And my Meditteraneo salad was fresh and lightly dressed lettuce, and topped with a really nice, mild feta. Yum. Prices are a bit high in general, but for a restaurant in the middle of Yorkville, it's not so bad. 

In sum: Food = 4 stars; Service = 2 stars, Ambience = 3 stars. In average, a 3 star experience."}
{"text":"Went to this Italian restaurant in Yorkville to get that Italian fix. We made reservations through Opentable and had lunch here before Icefest. The restaurant wasn't too busy but it picked up as we ate our lunch. We decided to get the prix-fixe menu where you get to choose an appetizer and main entree plus coffee and tea for $18.95. It was a pretty good deal. I ordered the Calamari Fritti for the appetizer and the Pizza Margherita for the entree. The calamari was quite food and it came a small side salad. Portion size was a good amount. The pizza was good but there wasn't really anything special about it. The service could have been better as we had to repeat several times to get simply things like bread and coffee. There also a bit of confusion getting are orders right when they came to our table. Overall, it was a decent lunch experience."}
{"text":"It's that complete air of arrogance that turns me right off from this location. Listen honey, I didn't make a career choice based on waiting tables. You did. The food was ok. First time I've had Italian food from a chef born and raised in the Islands. I'd skip this location."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Charged us for a mandatory 18% tip for horrible food and service during winterlicious. The meat was overly cooked, salmon was NOT fresh, and the mussel had gone bad to the point where we could not continue eating (later in the evening my friend had actually had stomach issues due to her meal). 

Overall would not recommend at all. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We had our yearly visit to Toronto and took in a play at the Panasonic theatre. We dined at Vaticano before the theatre and loved the food, the history of the place and the service. Would not change a thing and we will be back."}
{"text":"I was there today with my friends. Ordered appetizers pizza and calamary.
Pizza was so tasteless and the calamari was ok. We ordered the main, rissoto with mushrooms, ooooohhh disapointment, rice overcooked and it was very salty so sad, the chicken we ordered was bland, not too much flavor, sea food casserole was nice from all the dishes it has more flavor. The lasagna was allright.
I think the best part of our meal was the wine. After the meal nobody felt good, super heavy.
My italian neighbour cooks so much better and she invites me for free.
Waiter was nice and explained everything.
Honestly so disapointed about this place, I was expecting better things from Yorkville, so sad :(."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special, the inside is nice and the area is great, but as far as food and service goes, they need work. 

Three of us went at lunch time and had a terrible experience. We waited almost 45 minutes (on a 1hr lunch break!) for the entrées. I had the chicken which was dry and kind of bland.  We were also suppose to receive a free dessert which we told them we no longer had time for since they made us wait so long. They said they would give it to us to go. The owner is not friendly and walks around the restaurant like he is some kind of celebrity. 

We got the very expensive bill where they charge gratuity on a table of 3? this was ridiculous! I will tip well over the average if the service is good but this was terrible. We refused to pay the 18% gratuity charge which they then removed. we then saw the owner literately \"throw\" our dessert in a box and told us we could leave.

I will never step foot back in here!"}
{"text":"A Italian restaurant in yorkville. Very dimmed, with home like interior (a fancy home). The waiter was spectacular and the food was decent. The price is a tad pricey but very reasonable for a nice date. Would be back for sure!"}
{"text":"In hopes of spending a wonderful dinner bonding with my visiting mom and aunt, my sister and I decided to take them both to Vaticano restaurant in Yorkville. I had heard great things in the past and decided this would be the place to take them. Unfortunately the experience didn't go quite as I had hoped. 

The interior walls were lined with picture from over the years of the staff with different celebrities thus giving off the illusion that this was the \"it\" place to go....my candlelit surroundings gave off a very sophisticated yet cozy feel however the service that followed did not....nor did it deserve the built up hype.

Following stressful weeks for us all we decided to indulge in some wine. When taking our order, our server asked us all what we would like. When she reached my sister, she said very specifically that she wanted a \"WHITE wine...perhaps the Pinot Grigio\" later when the server returned my sister was met with a glass of Rose wine....as our server came around the table to pour my mother a glass of her merlot, she ended up spilling it all over the table and in the process a few drops onto my mothers white fur vest. Both are far too polite to say anything about this but all in all it was a mutual agreement between us that had the server been paying more attention to detail she would have noticed it was the wrong wine and perhaps the spillage could have been avoided.

Once all of our entrees arrived both my mothers and mine were missing our sides...we had to wait for another 10 minutes for our side salads...which ended up appearing like that had come straight from a ready made spring mix box at metro....the sautéed veggies that came with 3 of our meals were all way over cooked as well. When the server went around the table to ask if we wanted any fresh ground pepper she stopped at my sisters plate....mid sentence as my sister started to say \"no thank you\" She was cut off by the server grounding fresh pepper across her meal. 

After finishing our meals we decided to skip out on coffee and desserts for fear something else would go array. Although the restaurant has beautiful decor and a warm welcoming atmosphere I feel it wasn't up to par with the service I have received at other restaurants in Yorkville. I feel it was a rather unfortunate dining experience for my family after having travelled 3 hours to come visit us. I do not think I will be back to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"A place that never fails but always bring comfort and delicious dishes. I have yet to try anything on the menu that hasn't exceeded my expectations. Some of our favorites are the eggplant parmigiana, Gloria salad, seafood risotto, penne bolognese. Oh and an amazing wine selection as well!"}
{"text":"Vaticano was, on the whole, a disappointment, a slight tarnish to the plurality and uniqueness and charm that defines Yorkville. The overpriced menu, coupled with an inattentive server and subsequent small meal portions leaves one wholly dissatisfied. Perhaps credit may be awarded with respect to the house olive oil, which is quite excellent, but rest assured not enough to earn the forgiveness of the other shortfalls."}
{"text":"The owner Felice and the bartender Peter were very friendly and accommodating. Luca was the entertainment for the evening singing fabulous tunes such as Frank Sinatra, Andrea Bocelli, Buble etc. 
We danced, we laughed and we were treated as if we were family.
The ambiance has a very warm, romantic feel to it. Not to mention the unforgettable meal that we had. Try the artichokes.....they are to die for!! 
A hidden gem in Yorkville that will tantalize our taste buds."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, and the service I had on the particular night I was there was equally great.  I ordered the chicken parm and it was cooked to perfection.  Good wine list, with a lot of true Italian choices. I get that the atmosphere is not for everyone, tables are close together, and it is a little much on the decor, but I would hesitate to relate it to Buca-di-Beppo (which is pure garbage).  Our server was great, he even fetched a cab for us in the pouring snow, walking down to the nearest cross street to do so.  Not sure many other places would do that."}
{"text":"Best italian restaurant in Toronto. service,location and food is great. Very flexible to accomodate whatever you want. My favourite is the Penne Arribiatta which is typical for whatever you buy at Vaticano: simple, great tasting and made from the best ingredients. Also very affordable. Dont understand some of the comments about being overpriced! Their wine list is great and very reasonable, most dishes are under twenty dollars and quality very good. If anything i think the service can be a bit slow at times,- takes a bit time before the food is on the table. Not great if in a rush, but not a problem if you tell them youre in a rush,"}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian restaurant. Would definitely come back, the pasta was amazing and mostly homemade. The restaurant was atmospheric and service was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious lunch with 7 coworkers.  We had a reservation.  Food was excellent but the service was slow and clumsy.  Had the carrot soup, spaghetti and meatballs and sorbet.  No water top up, didn't get a spoon for my pasta which made it hard to eat, no offer of pepper or parm cheese for the top.  Dessert and cheque took a long time to come.  Owner was helping with service but wait staff seemed indifferent.  With so many choices in the area I would have thought distinguishing yourself with great service would encourage repeat business.  I might return if my arm was twisted cause the food was good but definitely not because of the poor service!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Overpriced. (eg $15 caprese with 3 tomato bits & 3 cheese bits; $15 strawberry bowl with promised but not present blackberries)"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday at the end of January. It was the first time here for both of us and we were very impressed. It was nice, quiet and romantic with a candle on our table. We ordered one appetizer which we shared and a meal each. I had a pasta dish while he had a veal dish with pasta on the side. Everything was amazing. We also had about a bottle and a half of wine. The only downfall was it was a bit pricy for me. The bill was well over $200.00 and that is not the amount of money  I'm willing to spend all the time on a dinner; Only on special occasions like this was...."}
{"text":"The food at Vaticano was great! My friend's calamari was super crispy & the sauce very tasty, while both the pizza and mushroom risotto were very good. That said, the prices are a little on the steep side, even for high quality Italian, AND even taking into consideration that it's in Yorkville. Vaticano would be best reserved for a special occasion."}
