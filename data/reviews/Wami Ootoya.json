{"text":"Second time much better than the first japanese restaurant that first opened at the same location. I usuAlly order the ramen when I come here. Very legit with aldente noodles, well seasoned broth and the pork belly grilled just right.  Have tried the rolls off the sushi menu and I have had better...meh. Cant go wrong with the ramen!!!"}
{"text":"Noodles were mooshy, broth was shallow, vegetables were not seasonal and careless. The kimchi was way far gone."}
{"text":"This is a ramen and sushi restaurant near brentwood train station. The ramen is very flavourful but can be overpowering so drink lots of water or tea. I recommend trying the miso ramen."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to this establishment. First time the service was horrible and seems like the waiter did not know what has doing or did not know the menu well enough. Decided to come back and try the as there was many options. This second time around the service once again was horrible. Ask for water for the table the waitress brings only one. The sashimi came out after we had to ask twice and she missed putting in the order. Even with a writing pad she missed it. Also the ramen I ordered was made with the wrong noodle. Also ordered a hot sake and it took forever to come out and was too hot to drink. There is nothing wrong with the food just the staff needs a lot more training. Only thing good about the staff was Ryan who was very helpful and polite. If I was to come back people again I would ask to be seated in his section. Otherwise as of right now not going back for awhile."}
{"text":"This is the worst Japanese restaurant I ever been. The food sucks and the service is horrible. Not only we got charged for 18% gratuity when we have 4 adults and 2 babies (who are just 13 months). The waitress even said \"Babies need service from others too, and you parents won't be serving your baby for your whole life, right?\" What a joke! And she said cause they got highchair there for babies to use so that's service. But we didn't use them or didn't even ask for a sip of water for the babies. I will never recommend others to go to this place anymore! So ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Looking for a non-pub place to eat near the university, a friend (and fellow Yelper!) suggested Wami.

Walking in the first thing that caught my eye was the Mega Ramen challenge advert. Finish the bowl (which was equivalent to 4 serving sizes of ramen) within 20 mins and it's free and you also had a chance to win prizes! Was I game? Hellllllll no. Was I hoping someone would do it while I was there? Absolutely! Lol

My friend and I got the aburi salmon oshizushi as an appie and we each got regular sized ramens as our mains. 

Then a gong rang out, lo and behold, a table close to us was doing the challenge - YES!

I really enjoyed the aburi salmon, there was a perfect caramelization from the sear and the unagi sauce was a nice touch.  

My spicy Korean ramen was pretty tasty. Although, we spent our dinner sneaking glances at the  guy doing the challenge that I think by mere proximity, we got full without touching our meals lol

I packed up my leftovers (which made for a great lunch the next day) and they brought us complimentary mango puddings for dessert!

For those wondering, the guy did end up completing the challenge in the allotted time. I don't know whether he won a prize or where he placed.

Oh! If you shop at the Brentwood Coop, the back of your receipt has a coupon for BOGO free for ramen or sushi roll with the purchase of two drinks. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Smart place, new modern decor. Service very good and friendly. Nicely presented food, excellent quality, mid range price point."}
{"text":"Best. Yam. Fries. EVER!!! I was with 3 other friends and we happened to order probably 8 rolls of sushi and yam fries, gyoza, drinks the whole works. It came out in reasonable time and tasted delicious! I will mention though it took a long time to get someone's attention for the bill, and our drinks took a very long time as well. I also ordered ramen but unfortunately filled up way too much on sushi to put a dent in it, but I did attempt! The broth was amazing and such a huge portion for your dollar, but noodles were pretty bland and no pizzazz of flavour was there. Will be returning for sure! Especially for the yam fries."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Favorites were the aburi salmon roll and tuna poke tower. Also had the tonkatsu ramen, calamari, karaage and ocean roll. Presentation was nice on large plates but could compact it a bit more to save some space. Service was very attentive. Would return to try more of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is the best japanese restaurant in Calgary. The sushi and sashimi are so tasty, I rate them better than Vancouver and Hong Kong. The blue fin, Hamachi collar, and sashimi salad were perfectly prepared and flawlessly presented. This is absolutely a 5 star Calgary japanese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Visited for a quick lunch and was very impressed. Coming from Toronto where there is ramen left and right, I was very happy to find a nice looking place in Calgary. 

Walking in, we were very impressed with the beautiful ambiance of the huge restaurant. We were seated quickly, and given waters. My boyfriend and I couldn't decide between the regular tonkotsu ramen and the tonkotsu black squid ink ramen. When our server came over and we shared our dilemma, she was amazing and told us she would bring us samples of each soup base! 

While both tasted great, we ended up selecting the tonkotsu black ramen each. To our surprise, we received free karaage for ordering 2+ bowls of ramen-- it was delicious and juicy! Our ramen came quickly after and we continued to be amazed by the quality of the food. The bbq pork was so tender and buttery and the portions were huge. The servers were quick to clear our plates upon finishing our meal, and we were even given green tea cookies as a dessert (they were SOOOO good). I let the server know that the cookies were yummy and he offered to bring out some more for us, to which I kindly declined as we were in a time crunch. 

All in all, this place was amazing. I typically do not write many reviews, but I knew I had to after dining here to let others know what a wonderful experience I had."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my parents and I was quite taken with the selections offered here. I ordered from their Gastropub slections Pork Belly Clubhouse Sandwhich served with their tempura sweet potato fries which was great the fries were crispy and not oily. The pork belly club was good. The taste was perfectly seasoned and they put sliced apples in it. I think I would of liked the apple cooked a little. Mother ordered the Korean Spicy Ramen with Charsiu and pork belly and kimchi, instead of ramen she chose the squid ink ramen instead. It was lightly spiced and the broth was also good it still lacked flavor though. The soup was hot in temp, which is important. My Dad ordered the Lunch Bento Box with Teriyaki Beef and Salmon. I have to say the portion given for the bento box was big. There was four big strips of salmon cooked perfectly. The miso soup was hot and I always find edamame beans is a cheap filler, I hate seeing that as a part of the bento box. My Dad did not enjoy it but....he thinks EDO of Japan is a gourmet meal so I don't trust his taste buds. Over all the meals were good I will go here again for dinner. So hopefully I have a better review update. I did also ordered their Mini Musubi (spam sushi) which was also good."}
{"text":"I was looking for a snack after an evening of hard work.my colleague and I wandered around Northwest Calgary and found this place after a quick search on the Internet for great sushi places in the area.we were pleasantly surprised!

When you walk in, the atmosphere is just very comforting.professional looking, and clean.the Decor is very classy. Reminds me of a places in Vancouver - The owner might be from Vancouver?

Staff are friendly, and very prompt with service.the girl with purple hair stop to chat with me for a bit about how she conditions her hair. she told me for example that she previously had her hair blonde and that's why it was easier for her to dye it a different color.   \"Living proof\" hair mask is what she uses instead of things like coconut oil.which I am not using.

The Sushi rolls and sashimi itself was quite good. Sashimi shown in photos. We also ordered the cook salmon and rice.I was not a big fan of the salmon.to be fair, I was looking for sushi more.so in future I will just not order cooked salmon.

Overall, I had a pretty good experience considering it wasn't full dinner and it was later in the evening.they close at 10 and staff were kind enough to extend a little bit of time so we could just chat.

Definitely recommend this place for Sushi.you won't be disappointed with the atmosphere either and the staff."}
{"text":"Their Ramen is good. Sushi was okay, not too bad. The service was good, not too many people when we got there, so the waiter was kind and service was not slow."}
{"text":"I am a lover of all food Japanese and this restaurant delivers.  The portion sizes are impressive and the food is reasonably priced.  They definitely try to focus on the art of Japanese food while not compromising on quantity or quality."}
{"text":"The service in this restaurant was great. Although it was quite busy when I went, they continuously made sure everything was ok with the meal. I had the black tonkotsu and it was very tasteful! Would recommend people to try it!"}
{"text":"Japanese is one of my favorite types of food, and being an adventurous eater, why not try a new Japanese restaurant for a weeknight dinner!  I came across this restaurant on a review site and was excited to check it out.

Atmosphere: 4/5  Wami is located in a mall in the Brentwood area.  Initially parking was a little difficult to find but we managed.  When I entered, I was surprised by the size of the restaurant - it was bigger than expected with a semi-open kitchen area and bar, and had an upstairs as well.  I love the high ceiling.  The area was spacious, clean and modern with the ability to accommodate larger groups.

Food: 4/5  There were a number of food options including appetizers, sushi, sashimi, house special rolls, and ramen. I was also interested to see that there is a 'gastropub' section.  We ended up getting the seaweed salad, two rolls - sunset and hi no sakana, and a tonkotsu ramen.  Overall flavourful and tasty!  I liked that there was not too much rice in the rolls.  The tonkotsu ramen was a little salty for me but overall tasted good.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the complementary blueberry / milk based dessert at the end - was a good finishing touch.  

Service: 4/5  Friendly and efficient, with good explanation of specials for the day.

Price: 3.5/5  Reasonable for type and quantity of food as well as service.  There were some specials on as this is a newer restaurant.

Overall: 4/5  I would recommend this restaurant for a nice Japanese fine-dining / fusion type dinner - I like that it has ramen as well as sushi / sashimi options; open and spacious to accommodate bigger groups too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! 
I have been here seven times for family dinners. The food and service is amazing. Five thumbs up for sure. 
I highly recommend this Asian Restaurant, 
BTW they make awesome Bubble Tea in there Loft Bubble Tea Bar upstairs."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Not spectacular or outstanding but not bad.  I had the garlic tonkotsu ramen and salmon + tuna sashimi plate for lunch and food came out really fast.  The sashimi was fresh and cut nicely, but the ramen fell short of expectations.  The noodle was a tad firm - I don't think it was undercooked, but rather, it was the texture.  Chashu slices had a nice balance of fat and lean meat and the ajitama (half) was cooked nicely.  What I didn't like was how they incorporated the garlic into the broth - the tonkotsu broth was not flavorful enough on its own and they just put a scoop of cooked garlic (garlic confit?) into it... I think a rich garlic oil or sauce would've made the flavors stood out more.

Price point is not too bad and service was excellent.  3.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Their ramen is better than any other place in the city, and I actively hunt down ramen shops to check out. Flavours are strong, volume is on par or larger than others, and the value for what you pay is better than anywhere else I've been. I mean their pork is super tender, and thick, i mean THICC.

Shiki Menya gives less pork, Muku is delicious and cheaper but doesn't have all the flavors Wami offers (i.e. black garlic is bomb, tonkatsu black is bomb too). Menyatai didn't give as much noodles, Ikemen was good but too expensive for the amount i got. You get my point."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today around 11:15. Ordered one sashimi lunch bento box and one tonkotsu ramen. The lunch bento box came, it was a very small portion with the normal cheap sashimi, salad that's probably straight from a bag and a miso soup. Way overpriced for what you got. I was half way done my lunch and my dad's ramen still didn't come. The waiter said it's quite busy but we were the first table there. It finally came and it was flavourless, noodles were like the instant ramen noodles. So really what you are paying for is the decor of the restaurant, poor food quality and service!"}
{"text":"Very new, spacious and modern interior with tons of seating. Great price and fast and friendly service. 

The pork belly in the ramen is buttery and delicious and the salmon sashimi is quality cut. The broth was flavorful and creamy. 

Very nice inside and easy to find parking. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"First time at this Sushi  and Ramen restaurant in NW Calgary. 

First impression menu is not overly large and great selection of sushi, sashimi, appetizers, ramen  noodles and gastropub food. 

Pricing is decent with average dish for sushi around $8-10 dollars and ramen around $15. 

Decor is super modern no surprise as it's a brand new restaurant and staff are super friendly. 

Open kitchen where you can see chefs which seems to be the trend. I had ordered the garlic chasau (bbq pork) ramen and dynamite rolls which were delicious. 

Overall if you enjoy sushi with  this is a fantastic place to eat with family and friends."}
{"text":"Ramen taste like instant noodle, not freshly made. The soft she'll crab roll is small, sushi and sashimi are so so. Our waitress do not know what is an uni or unagi is. Will not visit again. There are plenty of good Japanese out there."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant reminds me of Kinjo. We went as a big group after a hiking trip. The gratuity was only 15% instead of 18% like most other places which was a pleasant surprise. The servers were very attentive and service was pretty good overall. However, my lemon slices for the water was quite dry which makes me wonder how long they were sitting outside. We decided to try their ramen since it seems to be their selling point. We ordered a few different ones. I got the seafood black. And my, what a let down. The noodle itself was nothing special. It actually reminded me of dried Chinese noodles. The broth was dark as promised but extremely blend. The toppings, other than a few thin slices of squid and small scallop, were two good sized mussels. However, for the price I paid, the toppings seem very disproportional to other restaurants. Overall, I'm very disappointed at my first visit. Some other people who ordered sushi dishes actually liked them better. Maybe I'll try the sushi dishes next time to really decide how this place is."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this sushi/ramen place from beginning to end. Convenient to our hotel, the Banff Trail TraveLodge, with a sleek, airy modern interior, super friendly and helpful server and excellent food. The ramen servings were large and visually enticing. My partner has the Spicy Korean ramen and I had the Curry with mussels, shrimp & scallop. The spicy suited my hot-loving friend's taste and my curry was a lightly sweet sauce that was delicious. The ramen itself was nicely al dente, which I found perfect. And there was a lot of it. Morning leftovers! We had a complimentary Flaming Circle roll for ordering two ramens and an ahi roll, both also good. Our server, a young lady whose name I neglected to get was so friendly and solicitous, our otherwise fine dinner experience was put over the top to thoroughly enjoyable. Even the green tea was delectable (even after a very hot day!). Also I was just happy to have an unsweetened tea (is sweet tea a Calgary or Canadian thing??). Even the complimentary desert, a litchi fruit custard in a shot glass was a very lightly sweet topper to the meal. Wami Ootoya was a particularly welcome relief after a series of dubious, Stampede fare, and for the amount of food, a real deal. If you are near the University of Calgary, this will also be very close and convenient walk."}
{"text":"I couldn't resist getting a chatime bubble tea before dinner since it was just across the street and thankfully they let me keep it inside the restaurant! :) 
The staff were really friendly and gave us a table without much of a wait at all. The place was really big with lots of available seating which was nice. 
I ordered the takoyaki (fried octopus balls) for starters which was really good! It had a big chuck of octopus instead instead of it being mixed it with the dough which personally I love. 
We ordered the Sakura blossom roll and the mango tango roll. The Sakura blossom had mango, avocado and scallops on the inside and salmon on the outside along with lime pepper and thyme aioli sauce on top. The mango roll had smoked salmon, avocado, cream cheese and tempera shrimp on the inside with a mango sauce on the outside. 
Both of these rolls looked gorgeous - the Sakura blossom roll was shaped like a heart and it was so cute! I thought that the aioli sauce on the Sakura blossom didn't quite fit and took away from the fillings because it was quite a strong lemon flavour. The salmon tasted fresh though. The mango tango was had a strong cream cheese flavour rather than mango so take it if you like cream cheese for sure! 
Overall, I really appreciated trying this new sushi restaurant in Brentwood and I would like to try their ramen next time! However, the hunt for Calgary's best sushi spot continues for me!"}
{"text":"This place cured my depression


good service, good food, good times, good and stuff


aaaaaaaaaaqaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"}
{"text":"Good fresh sashimi in a large pleasant setting. Pork belly and said was especially good. Service was fast and friendly. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great to have a decent Japanese place near the U of C- it's great to have ANYTHING that's walking distance from U of C. This is in one of the (BIG) retail spaces in the University City condo towers adjacent to the Brentwood LRT station; it's a massive two-storey space. I had lunch there yesterday and ordered chicken karaage and two sushi rolls, yam tempura and spicy tuna. I did not order ramen which seems to be the house specialty, but I wasn't in the mood for it.

Everything was decent- not earth-shattering but decent, competently made with friendly, reasonably fast service. The karaage is simple lightly floured thigh meat, maybe a bit inelegantly rendered into \"bite sized pieces\" (I think every Japanese restaurant should emulate the perfection that is Red's Japa Cafe, best karaage in Calgary) and served with spicy mayo on the side. It's a good-sized portion. The sushi was tasty with very well-cooked rice. Both rolls were so similar to what they sell at Midori on 17th Ave that I asked if the restos were related- nope. All in all a good, filling lunch.

This'd be a 3-star review as I was satisfied but not remotely blown away, but for a couple of really nice things: First, this was cheap! I was full to bursting and my bill was just shy of $18. For Calgary- for almost any NA city- that's good value. Second, they brought a little dessert in a shot glass with my bill, a little morsel of chocolate cake with whipped cream. That was just endearing as heck and much appreciated."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed in this ramen. All of it tasted fishy and had little to no flavour - I would give this restaurant zero stars if I could. Get jinya or ikemen instead, waste of money."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken and tonkotoya ramen bowls and was very unhappy with it. Was extremely fishy and the noodles and sauce were bland and didn't taste like anything. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm very happy to see a ramen place pop.uo in the northwest especially one with lots of parking! The menu is quite large. I tried the house tonkatsu ramen and the poke nachos. The ramen broth was rich and not too salty. The toppings were generous and I was happy that the bowls came with half of an egg. The pork belly was very interesting: half of the slices reminded me of a porchetta with pork sausage wrapped in pork loin. The other half were pork belly slices rolled into discs. The poke was my favourite part - tuna and salmon sashimi mixed with avocado served on fried wonton crisps. The serving portion was very large and it would be great for sharing!

Service was fast and attentive."}
{"text":"I come from Vancouver where all anyone does is eat. So my ramen standards are pretty high. A friend recommended this place to me. The staff was pretty friendly and the place is nice and tidy. I ordered the miso ramen and all in all, it was pretty good. The first thing I noticed was the boiled egg. You could tell that it was made early during the day and refrigerated due to its temperature. The noodles I would say are pretty average but the broth was full of umami flavour. The absolute highlight of my bowl of ramen has to be the cha-shu. The skin had a slight crunchy texture to it, with a nice mix of fat and meat. I'd definitely recommend this place and visit again."}
{"text":"Update: Much better experience on our 2nd visit. This time we bought more family members and ordered more food.

We ordered black ramen, seafood black ramen, 2 orders of tonkatsu ramen, bento box, korean ramen, and 2 orders of takoyaki. On top of our huge order we got a bowl of curry don for free(that day they had an offer: If you spend $50 or more you get the curry don for free)!This time all of our dishes were excellent(lacking in presentation a lil bit), I especially loved their curry don and black ramen. They even gave use free mini mango pudding shots.

Service was great as well except for at the start we waited around 15 minutes to get our drinks. Even though the restaurant was busy, since we came at lunch time, our orders came right away.

For the quantity and quality of food we got, and for the price, definitely would recommend Wami Ootoya to friends and family."}
{"text":"Great spot by the university for Japanese food and sushi. Every time I've been here I've been satisfied with the food and service. The staff are always smiling and helpful, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is generally pleasant. 

The takoyaki is really delicious here, and there is a lot of choice on the menu. If you come during lunch time you can usually get a special on a bento box which has a little bit of everything. I personally really like the chicken teriyaki here, the grilled veggies add a nice smoky flavour to the dish, while the green onions add freshness and bite."}
{"text":"Was eager to try this place because a) ramen b) walking distance from U of C. They have sushi, ramen, udon and many other dishes, so it really covers a variety of tastes depending on what you craving that day. A friend and I came in on a weekday afternoon and we left little disappointed. Service was poor and food wasn't anything mindblowing. 

I was craving spicy miso ramen, but unfortunately they didn't have that on the menu. Normally I would get a miso broth and just add chili oil or some sort of spice to it, but they didn't have that option either. I decided to get the Korean ramen which instead had a tomato based broth that I was slightly apprehensive of, but I wanted to give it a go. I liked the spice level but the broth and noodles were a little bland. I do appreciate that it had 3 pieces of char su pork and that it was delicious. My friend got the lunch special of the day, which was the loco moco. It came with soup and salad and he said he liked it. It was a pretty good price too. We ordered chicken kaarage and gyoza which were pretty good. 

Despite being the absolute ONLY people in the entire place (which is pretty big), we had barely any interaction with the staff. They only came by to take our order and give us the bill. They didn't check in on us once and didn't refill our waters. I couldn't even flag anyone down because no one walked by. Once they cleared our plates, they immediately came back with the bill, the machine and started punching our bill in without saying a word. Needless to say, it was poor service all around and we felt pretty rushed despite being the only people there. 

I hope this was a one-off time with the service because I wasn't impressed at all, which is why I'm giving it a 2 star from an otherwise 3 star place. Food was okay, but the service was seriously lacking. I might have to wait a while before I give this place another go."}
{"text":"Huge selection from their menus, items are pretty unique given the Japanese restaurants we have in Calgary. However, I've been here twice and its really only been mediocre. Sashimi salad is just slabs of sashimi with spring mix and Korean spicy sauce as a dressing. Their poke tower is served with wonton chips which don't entirely make sense but are palatable anyway. The sashimi pieces were also massive slabs that can't physically fit onto your chip so really you end up picking up a piece of sashimi with your chopstick and then eating a chip after. Poke tower is lightly seasoned/flavored, not sure with what.  Had the tonkotsu ramen that had a huge variety of toppings but the most essential part, the broth, was very lacking in flavor and tasted like it came out of an instant noodle packet. The bamboo shoots must have also come in a can or packet because it tasted strongly of preservative. 

The first time I visited Wami, they had a lobster deal where they served lobster sashimi, lobster ramen and a boiled claw. Pretty unique! It was pretty tasty. Only thing was the ramen was not quite hot, just lukewarm at best. 

Service was great although the waiter did not have much of a clue as to what everything tasted like as he had not tried any of it himself.

Will definitely revisit Wami in the future to try out more items from their huge menu, hopefully they will have refined some of their dishes by then."}
{"text":"Our experience at Wami Ootoya was a fantastic one!  What a find in Brentwood!  This is a great place for an early dinner as it's opened practically the whole day.  

We ordered the following items:
- Endamame - lightly salted and warm
- Spider Roll - There were 8 pieces of still warm rice with lightly battered spider crab and cucumber.  Very fresh tasting.
- Tonkatsu Ramen - the best bone broth I've tasted in a long time with the softest and tasties pork belly slices
- Black Tonkatsu Ramen - similar to above except with black squid ink
- Korean Ramen - Spicy soup and a hit with my dad!
- Black Seafood Ramen - a clear squid ink broth with mussels, prawns, baby scallops and green onions.  Quite tasty and not too salty.
The ramen is springy and freshly made.

Upon finishing our meal, the very nice waitress brought 4 tiny chocolate cupcakes with green tea cream on the top!  A very nice finish for a lovely meal.

Oh, definitely we will be back!  There are loads more that I want to try."}
