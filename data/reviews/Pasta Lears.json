{"text":"This is the little family run Italian restaurant on the corner you've been looking for. Great food, friendly service, and a family atmosphere. Not a huge menu, but that's a good thing. Definitely worth a try when you're tired of the same old chain restaurants. Stop in, relax, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great authentic pizza! Love the crust, very fresh ingredients! My favorite is the Chicken Club Specialty pizza. Friendly atmosphere and prompt service!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Great family restaurant. Food was delicious, the atmosphere was terrific and service was excellent."}
{"text":"In a town of great Italian eateries, this place doesn't bat too high in the rotation.  Not that it's bad, it's just not as good.  We started with the fried vegetables which were very well done, especially the zucchini.  We each had a glass of wine (no draft beer, which is a big sticking point for me; I can buy bottles of Coors at the grocery store if I wanted to, which I don't).  The pizza was nicely done, but was heavy with cured meats which seeped moisture into the crust, making it soggy (yes, I still ate half of it).  We finished with a tiramisu which had cinnamon on it and was quite nice.  Lastly, we had a 'meal deal' coupon of some sort which brought the price down a little, but otherwise the food seemed a bit on the pricey side.  The service was friendly, but the other reviews that take issue with the 'family style' service don't surprise me."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and salad here when I was in town for business.  It was really good pizza with soft, doughy crust and fresh, flavorful vegetables.  Loved the pepperoni slices on the house salad, too!"}
{"text":"The pizza here (specifically the pizza with tomatoes and black olives) was life changing. Perfect combination of flavors. The crust was flawless. I cannot say enough good things about this pizza."}
{"text":"We love the pizza at Pasta Lear's! We were in on a Friday night and had Maddie as our server. She was awesome, taking care of the entire dining room while still giving each of her tables efficient and personal service. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian place. They have fantastic house dressing and breadsticks. Everyone who works here is friendly and quick. The meatballs are delectable and the prices are very reasonable! Can't forget their awesome pasta sauce and pizza."}
{"text":"First off I had a super insane day and was seriously having some low sugar and super hangery! The guy who took my order over the phone and the guy who delivered were so nice which is hard to find, because most people just sound like they want to go home so thank you!! The food was tasty and just what I needed! Definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"i wish we hadn't gone so late and that i'd gotten pizza. i honestly didn't like my pasta bolognese at all but ate it anyway. the pizza pics on Yelp looked good and i should have just had that.  also, the staff spent the entire time we were there openly and loudly complaining about customers. a real turn off."}
{"text":"First time at Lear's pizza and had a great meal! Tried out the mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and the Tuscan pizza as the meal, both were delicious! Our server Emily was very friendly and attentive! Will definitely return in the future!"}
{"text":"Cute Mom & Pop joint.  The owner was walking around to tables chatting w/ the regulars.  The waitress wasn't overly friendly, but did a nice job checking in on us.  First the negatives: 1. The cleaning solution (I overheard the waitress tell a guest it was Lysol) was soooo fragrant that I almost gagged on it.  Again, I'm a fragrant intolerant so I'm sensitive to it, but seriously, had I been eating I'm sure I would have tasted Lysol 2. When I order a 'za with basil on it, I expect basil...big fat leaves of basil, not flakes dusted from your mom's old spice jar.  I feel like this is a bit of false advertising. 3. No sauce on another 'za.  Maybe I didn't read the description, but if you aren't going to put \"normal\" sauce on the 'za, say what you're putting on (or not).   4.  Expensive.  I get that you have to cover your food costs....but seriously for two almost \"personal pan\" size pizzas it was $25!?  Ugh. 5. The parking lot sucks.  The Positives: 1. Cute. 2. Clean. 3. Cute kitchen guys (yes, they all told me goodbye as I left)  Would I go back?  Maybe.... but maybe not. Disappointing, especially since I'd read such good reviews."}
{"text":"The overall dining experience here was strange. The dining room smelled like some sort of strong perfume or cleaner and was very cold. The waitress was young and unable to answer questions about some of the menu and the wine list, which was fine. The issue is that the dining room manager, Patty, seemed very uninterested in customer service. She told another customer they could not use their coupon even though they had called ahead and spoken to the owner's wife, who had told them the coupon was valid. I also heard this manager tell other diners not to listen to the waitress because she \"knows nothing\". Very unprofessional. The kitchen staff was listening to loud music that conflicted with the dining room music. The owner came out and sat at a table to watch the game on tv. Seriously? Luckily for Pasta Lear's, we ordered the Tuscan pizza and it was amazing. I'd recommend taking this food to go because of the bad dine in ambiance!"}
{"text":"Pizza was just OK. The crust tasted like frozen pizza crust, overlooked on the outside, doughy on then inside.  There were only about 5 tables filled, yet we waited 20 minutes for our check after finishing eating. We waited another 20 for our receipt. Service was so slow, with only 1 server, and the owner was sitting talking to customers while we waited.  Food is pricey as well."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, will definitely be back soon! Emily kept our drinks topped up and was a great server! We had the Tuscan pizza and it was loaded with toppings. Very cheesy and the pizza dough is fantastic. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went for pizza after the bike show with my 12 year old nephew.  An employee working turned 21 so the staff and owner did several shots while we were waiting four our food, and while we were eating (they were all working).  This is not acceptable!  I will contact OSHA and the health department.  We will not be returning!!"}
{"text":"Still love this place! Awesome food, reasonable price and quaint atmosphere. Our server Maddie was handling the whole place and she was still excellent! Better than most servers with two tables I've had most other places!"}
{"text":"We went here for a quick lunch date and we were pleasantly surprised!! The restaurant was so comfortable and clean. The server was very friendly and attentive. The whole staff was very friendly. The food was absolutely amazing. It was definitely one of the BEST pizzas we have ever had. The menu was really cool. They had really creative ideas for the specialty pizzas and other items! They even had a little wine bar. We will definitely be going back and letting everyone to try this place!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location since way back when it was Verdone's Pizza. I took my mother here last night for dinner.  Decor/atmosphere: While they saved a ton of money buying cheap furniture, it was comfortable. I love the Italian mural on the wall. The ONLY reason Pasta Lear's did not get a complete 5 stars is because there was gangsta rap playing loudly from the kitchen and it was distracting to the dining experience.  Service: Our server was Grace and she was pleasant, attentive and very helpful!  Food: Mother went with the Fettuccine Alfredo (she wanted one of the red sauce dishes but since they make their sauces from scratch and use whole tomatoes, the seeds cannot be in her diet) and it was plentiful and savory. I opted for their pizza and I must say that I am very impressed. I have lived in Europe and eaten pizza all over Italy. I have also recently moved back to Cleveland from the Jersey Shore (Pizza Mecca) and this pizza pie was simply perfect! Puffy like a Chicago pizza, but the sauce was as if I were in Brooklyn, NY! I am SO VERY IMPRESSED!  Cost: I will say that since the ingredients were all homemade, the cost is exactly perfect for this type of mom & pop restaurant! Well Done, Pasta Lear's!"}
{"text":"Being from CA I really believed the previous reviews.  Afterall, there is some GOOD food in Ohio.  The exterior, reminded us of a \"hole in the wall\".  The interior is small but clean and has the feel of a mom & pop's Italian restaurant.  We weren't greeted and/acknowledge for a few minutes.  We were seated for approximately 7 minutes before our server said \"I'll be right with you.\"  They have no more than 20 tables in the entire place and it was 1/2 full with 3 servers, no reason to wait that long.  I ordered cheese ravioli's, my husband chicken Parmesan.  I ordered soup (the wedding soup) and my husband got a salad with the house dressing (Italian dressing with garlic.)  Those were good, but my ravioli's tasted like Chef Boyardee Marinara sauce (gag) and the raviolis were FLAVORLESS.  It was a large version of the canned pasta.  My husband chicken Parmesan was served CUT UP on top of penne pasta.  He was confused, she said 'would you like cheese melted on this?\"  She took it back and it took an additional 10 minutes for that to be brought out.  While I was scraping off ANY sauce and gagging down a couple of my ravioli's, he finally received his dinner.  He offered me a bite saying \"it's got too much parmesan cheese in it.\"  I said NO IT TASTES LIKE SALT.    To make things worse, while I'm trying to choke down my dinner, one of the servers (I think her name was Leslie) was spraying the tables with this STRONG cleanser that overpowered the room.  Another patron complained and I pointed my fingers right at her, she then denied she did this to another server :-(  Please people, this is not good."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Been here a few times over the years. I'm partial to the alfredo at Olive Garden, so I don't recommend it here, not as good. However, the chicken Cobb salad, pizza and pepperoni bread appetizer are all very good. I will be going back for sure. *Addition to original comment 6/26/17:: Recently ordered pizza, they missed my pepperoni on two slices :("}
{"text":"YAY for my 50th review! I went to Pasta Lear's because I have heard all about it from my boyfriend...and I'm so glad I listened to him!  We had the garlic bread for an appetizer and a medium pepperoni pizza, both homemade and both quite delicious.  The crust was so good and soft, you can definitely tell they take their time making it for each customer. It's a very family owned type of place and you can tell that they really strive to get to know each person that walks in. Great atmosphere, not over the top Italian theme, but still cute.   I did see that they do have coupons on their website, yay! So I will be going back to Pasta Lears very soon :)"}
{"text":"For my money, Pasta Lear's is one of the two best pizza places on the west side. I have also had their pasta dinners and they're very tasty as well."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have ever had. It took 25 minutes to cook our margarita pizza that came with a few bits of cheese on it. Also, they forgot the basil. Their crust tasted like frozen pizza crust. This was the worst money I have ever spent on pizza. Ever."}
{"text":"The food is surprisingly good considering that this is basically a pizza place in the shadow of a gas station. Nothing spectacular, but pretty decent grub - general American fare, with pizza, sandwiches, and the like. A coworker swears by the corned beef, but I'm partial to the hot stuffed pepper pizza - you be the judge of who's right!"}
