{"text":"One of the greatest BBQ spots in Cleveland. I grew up in the Cleveland Heights location and was thoroughly depressed when it closed. I couldn't be happier that it reopened. From the Fun In A Box, to the polish boy, to the different dinner combos, everything is awesome. Make sure you get the sauce on everything."}
{"text":"Maybe I went too early on and there were still some growing pains...idk   I was super stoked that there was a new bbq place, and that they were open late enough for me to grab food after work. I'm super sad to say I was disappointed. The two guys that were working that night were EXCEPTIONALLY nice, hence why I feel bad about this review. I ordered Mac and cheese and a breaded chicken sandwich. I also got a side of their hot bbq sauce. The chicken sandwich was disappointing, it seemed to be frozen, since it was pretty uniformly shaped. The Mac and cheese I reheated when I got home, but even then it wasn't creamy, more like a couple days old and congealed. The bbq sauce, while I could have used some heat since it was their spicy version, was fabulous. I could eat that sauce on just about anything. For the price, pretty expensive for what you get. I got a sandwich and two sides and it was around $20. All in all, don't know if I would try the food again, but I'd buy the sauce for sure."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of the original location in Cleveland Heights, which sadly closed more than a decade ago. Walking into this shop was like a time warp for me. The owner, Andrew, is still just as friendly and mellow as ever. I had to get my old favorite, the fun-in-a-box, which is a heavenly pile of fried chicken and skinny well-done French fries covered in savory/spicy barbecue sauce. It's difficult to explain why it is so good. You just have to try it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I can't wait to go back and sample the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Stop in today for a quick lunch with a coworker and i was impressed! The inside is very small and only has 4 or so tables, the service is fast and friendly. I ordered the po boy platter and a side of collard greens, the po boy was huge and well dressed the fries on top were crispy sauce was on point and coleslaw was flavorful, the sausage was slightly dry on the end but great flavor other then that. The 5 wings that came with it were lightly breaded and perfectly crispy and went well with there sauce which was also on the fries which were perfectly cooked. I only wish i could have choose original or there hot sauce that they have, the hot is delicious.  Oh and i cant forget about the collard greens which were in my top 3 and i love greens and have eaten them from here to the deep south i will definitely be ordering them again.  I will be back again soon to try the rest of there menu items to see if the rest off the bbq is as good and will ajust rating accordingly. But as of now it is a solid 4 stars maybe 4.5. My only wish would be some fried okra on the menu but thats just a personal favorite."}
{"text":"I have now become a regular to Mama's Boy BBQ. I have sampled many of their menu items and I am very impressed with a lot of items that don't typically come to mind when you think of Barbcue. Cheif among these is the Polish Boy. I am also quite fond of the hand breaded fried chicken and the fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Good BBQ sauce and tasty food. Very generous with take out portions. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant and was very disappointed. I ordered (6) wings and fries. The small wings / fries came in a cardboard box. The meal was over priced for the value.    There is also very little room to sit and eat inside.   If you are not interested in watching Fox News network, or listening to talk radio host Larry Elder, this may not be the place for you. The owner appears to to be a proud black conservative and has no problem letting you know it.   I would suggest no black person support this restaurant.  All skin folks are not kin folks."}
{"text":"Pulled pork had no evidence of ever having been near a fire or smoke. Cringeworthy sandwich and poor portion for the price.   No clue how anyone could rate this establishment 5 stars."}
{"text":"Still, after 60 years, on of my favorite BBQs.  Lived on their $1.89 1/2 chicken dinners in the 60s when they were on Euclid Ave.  Had a couple of ribs for lunch this trip.  Very tasty!  Not fall-off-the-bone,tho.  Will be back for a chicken dinner next time I'm out that way."}
{"text":"Road past there too many times so I decided to stop in.  I decided to get the wings and fries, it came with 4 whole wings and lots of fries with the house bbq sauce for 8.00 and it was buy 1 get 1 half off so I got another for my son, I also ordered me a perch sandwich for 6.00.  I The fries were the best part of all the food I ordered with the sauce in close 2nd.  The fish was extremely small, the meat to bread ratio was off with the bun smothering the little piece of fish underneath and wasn't worth the 6.00, the wings were fair size, but didn't break well, I hate wings that doesn't tear apart easy.  I may give them a 2nd try"}
{"text":"Upon second glance, I have to up the star rating for this spot's (whole) chicken WINGS. This spot serves what consider one of the best whole wings I've had in the area. Bam. One more star.   I initially gave a 3 because this place is a BBQ joint and the ribs on their own were a fair 3 for me. But these wings. Four.stars.  I have to CORRECT my previous review, however, because the 6 for 6 special is for the smaller wingettes, and NOT the whole wings.. The last time I came I had ordered the rib and wing special which came with two whole wings. So I ordered the 6 wing special today... incorrectly assuming it would be six of those whole wings. Nope.  Make sure you make the distinction and get the whole wings and you should be good to go! Also, if taking away, it's always better to get sauce on the side and not on your fries...fries are pretty good..But sauce on top for take away lessens the crisp. Thumbs up :)"}
