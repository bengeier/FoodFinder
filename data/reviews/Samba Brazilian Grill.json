{"text":"Wow, this is definitely a dining experience!  The atmosphere inside the restaurant is exotic and exciting.  The meat is simply fanstastic--the night I went, the flank steak was the best.  I'm not a big fan of the linguia, but there are so many good meats to choose from.  The salad bar is also remarkable, with a wide variety of rice and pasta dishes, cold cuts, cheeses, and veggies--but don't fill up!  

This is the perfect Valentine's Day/Birthday/Anniversary dinner.  Be sure to come on a night when a band is playing."}
{"text":"Great looking place! Waited 25 minuts but only 10 or so dining..... not sure why! Salad was good! Food was o.k! Most was dry and overcooked. The rolls however were outstanking."}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased a Groupon and were excited to take my mother-in-law and her boyfriend as a treat.
Boy, were we wrong!

The waiter told us that they were offering 8 different meat selections that night (4 beef, 1 chicken, 1 sausage, 1 lamb, and 1 pork).  We saw the flank steak and sausage quite often but had to beg every gaucho we saw along with waiter for the beef tenderloin. 2 hours into our visit, we finally got it. It was salty and tasted solely of soy sauce. Not worth the wait.
We saw the pineapple every 5 minutes but rarely saw meat except the sausage and flank steak. When we asked to have some lamb again, the waiter huffed at us and told us that there were 100 people upstairs also looking for food. I'm sorry, but I matter just as much as other customers.

Only one of our gauchos was nice. The rest were rude, curt, and slammed down their sword holders onto our table. Our waiter was rude about us asking for other meats and even grabbed my mother-in-law's hand!

We will not be returning here. The service was bad, and the food wasn't that good for the price. We'll go back to the Tornado Steak House instead."}
{"text":"We went there fairly late in the evening, and the staff was fine with two of our party trickling in late.  The atmosphere is awesome, I'm not sure if they actually revamped an old theater or just faked it very well, but it's quite beautiful. Totally 'date worthy' surroundings.

The 1st course salad bar had everything from heart of palm to pickled vegetables and cheeses, hot garlic mashed potatoes, wasabi potato salad, as well as the normal greens and veg. 

We were really happy with the meat course - 8 different offerings. The only one i was iffy on was the lamb, which in itself tasted good, but seemed more like it should be it's own dinner thing with some milder food to complement the heavy spicing. It didn't really go well with the other offerings. I love lamb, and wish they could have had something a little less wacky. The Parmesan pork was ok, not great - a little bland. The various beef cuts were amazing though, and I loved the garlic chicken. Our whole party pretty much burst into laughter at the waiter 's suggestion of dessert. Their poor pastry chef doesn't get much call for work, as I think most people do NOT save room for dessert. 

The on tap list was very nice, was pleased to see Crispen cider there (as I am not much of a beer drinker), and the wine list was quite large. Going to have to attempt a brunch sometime."}
{"text":"I got the nuro virus from this place not having a sanitary enough salad bar and was throwing up so much the next day that I needed to get an IV injected into me at the student health center. I have had much better experiences in there in the past, and the food is undoubtedly very tasty. However, after almost having to get an ambulance because I was so drained from food poisoning/the nuro virus the serve yourself salad bar atmosphere suddenly lost the all you cant eat appeal and was replaced with a visage of  a slightly upscale version of an all you can eat Las Vegas strip club with less of the grotesque entertainment but all of the bacteria. ;). Who needs a walk up style menu any ways? Last time I had that was at a continental breakfast at a Marriott hotel...I should have kept it that way."}
{"text":"After visiting Sabor in Milwaukee and loving the Brazillian dining experience we decided to try out Samba on our trip to Madison after getting a Groupon offer, and I'm glad we had a coupon because our visit was plain disappointing. 

A few of the positive aspects: 
-Grilled pineapple w/ cinnamon sugar was amazing, when it cam around. 
-We arrived early for our reservation and they were willing to accommodate us and find us a table.
-Salad bar was pretty good, the stew was awesome.
-The sausage was very good and flavorful. 

Now on to the bad parts:
-Meat was mediocre at best. Most of it was way over done and tough. We usually like our steak Medium Rare or Medium so this was a disappointment.  We did have a few pieces that were done properly and then they were very tasty, but that was few and far between. 
-When they cam around with the meat there usually wasn't a lot left on the skewer and they would give you enough for 1 or 2 bites then we wouldn't see anyone again for 10-15 minutes. One of the cuts I received was 80% fat. 
-The majority of the meat we received was lukewarm at best. 


When we got there we were seated on a table by the wall. The waitress came by to get our drink order and we were told that she would bring our bread and have the pineapple come around in a little bit. I don't think we saw anything for at least 10 minutes. There was a table of 10 people or so across from us and the guys with the meat would go by them first and they would either be out of meat by then or just leave without acknowledging us. This was very frustrating.  When we did get someone to stop by the table they only gave us a bite or two worth of meat (probably becuase they were usually almost out of meat) and sometimes would not even ask me if I wanted any after they asked my boyfriend.  So probably about half the time they gave him meat and then just walked away.  We will not be coming back to give Samba another chance. 

If you're going to be in the Milwaukee area and are looking for a great Brazilian Grill experience, check out Sabor. We've been there 5 times and walked away completely satisfied each time."}
{"text":"First off, let me just say that I'm only giving 3 stars because of the Price and the fact that, as someone else stated, it loses it's appeal after the second time around. 

My first experience there was great, entertaining, was with a bunch of people, a good time.
Second time I went with family, so another group, so it was fun, chitter chattering, and enjoying each others company.

And the meat... yes, there is meat, plenty of different meats. And PLENTY of it. 
You could get sick off that alone, and not even need to hit the 'salad' bar, which also has... meat.

If you haven't gone, go, suck it up and go. Take a group or go with a special someone, it's about 120 for two people. 

The only other thing that is a HUGE deal, HUGE mistake you can make depending on the group....

WATCH THE BILL!!
They add tip to the bill, but don't tell you, if you don't read through it all you'll miss it. The first time, we ended up double tipping the waitress. 
Because, again, they add tip to the bill. So be careful with that. 

It's a nice place to visit a few times, but I could go without ever setting foot in the place again.

One more thing.

Eat the pineapple.
Eat lots of pineapple."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's always been a good experience.  I love the building Samba is in.  The interior is very nice and pretty luxe for Madison.  

I enjoy the food, though I'm usually not a big fan of all you can eat.  I know that's typically how Brazilian steakhouses work though.  You can also make a filling meal out of the salad bar, which contains nuts, cheeses, beans, mashed potatoes and the more typical vegetables.  I've never had a problem with the quality of the meat, though I'm not a big meat eater in general.  I like the grilled pineapple or the figs from the salad bar as a light dessert option.  They also have quite a few options for drinks.  

Service has always been reliable.  I think the price is fair considering the quantity.  They sometimes have specials, like on Sundays."}
{"text":"I've been to Samba now probably a dozen times over the past 5 years or so and I always enjoy coming back. I'm not sure it can be compared apples to apples to a place like Fogo De Chao (like others might compare), because it is more costly ($50 per plate) and therefore the service reflects what you are paying (constant refilling of waters, a dirty plate never sits on your table for more than a minute, telling a server you want a fresh round of a certain type of meat at a certain degree of \"doneness\"). At Samba, you pay a respectable amount (I believe it's $35) and get respectable service. 

My most recent experience there was great. We went on a Wednesday night at 5:15, and were lucky enough to be one of only a few other couples, so we got a fresh round of meat constantly. It became crowded about an hour later, but the rounds were still coming around regularly. Our server was very nice and attentive, as well as the gauchos. 

I like to have a few things from the salad bar, but not too much so I don't get full quickly. Their whole selection of food up there is great, but I usually limit myself to a couple of cheeses, roasted almonds, and a mix of spring mix/romaine lettuce with tomato vinaigrette and Caesar dressings (all delish). 

I don't eat pork or lamb, and limit myself to the beef selections (I'm sure their chicken is great but I gotta save room for the best part). They didn't have my favorite this time (picanha), but they did have Flank Steak with a honey/balsamic marinade which was superb, and may even be my favorite now! The tenderloin with pepper rub was very good as well. End the meal with the grilled pineapple (so juicy and flavorful) and you've got yourself a top-notch dinner! Thanks again Samba for a great experience."}
{"text":"Same concept as Fogo de Chao in bigger cities, but much more affordable. Amazing cuts of meat and amesome salad bar. The live jazz in the background was an unexpected treat!"}
{"text":"I was so unbelievably disappointed in this place. A group of girls and I were going out for a girls night a few weeks before my wedding. My aunt called weeks in advance for reservations & a special table. When we arrived we were seated in a private room with a childs baptism party. Really, seriously poor match. It took forever for our food, they skipped us on multiple occasions and then tried to skimp on portions. We had to ask for more. we kept being hushed & we weren't even being loud!!! The service was terrible and the place is over priced!!! It's a nice change of pace but way over rated. Good thing my guests were super cool bc samba blew it!"}
{"text":"Yes the prices are high, but they're not as high as a Fogo de Chao or other super upscale Brazilian Steakhouse. However, the quality of meat is nearly as good. They have nine different meats: two Top Sirloins, Flank Steak, Beef Tenderloin, sausage, garlic chicken legs, Mango BBQ chicken, Parmesan Pork tenderloin, and Leg of Lamb. The pork, beef and BBQ chicken were all so tender and flavorful. Great contrast of tastes for the meats: the tenderloin and BBQ chicken were very sweet while the sirloin and pork were very savory. The cinnamon pineapple is absolutely amazing and really provides a good mix up for the meat. 

The reason I'm not giving them five stars is their salad bar was a big let down. A couple stews, different salads you could find at a WalMart (potato salad, pasta salad, romaine lettuce, etc). I guess I thought there should have been more accouterments for the meat. 

Plan on sitting for a while and eating to your heart's content-- I'd suggest going very, very hungry and you'll be satisfied!"}
{"text":"I came here a few years back since I had never gone to a Brazilian steakhouse.  The short of it is that the food is decent, but the service is terrible.

My friends and I visited as part of \"Restaurant Week.\"  They have many servers who bring meat and slice it onto your plate, and you have the option to try many of their side dishes while you wait.  Their garlic mashed potatoes were delicious, but I don't remember anything else that stood out much, so I can only remember it not being stellar.  The meat was okay... if you can get it.  The food quality is probably akin to a mid-level steakhouse.  The service is another story.  I can understand that they are extremely busy with serving all the people there, and that they can only bring specific meats every so often, but we were often left with nothing on our plates.  

When they did come around with the skewers, it was usually something that was not particular popular that night and hence something we were not particularly interested in.  Most of the time we would still eat it, mostly because we were too hungry to wait for the favorites such as the tenderloin and flank steak.  The frustrating part was not just that we did not get any food, but they often just flat out walked past us instead.  We had the unfortunate luck of being seated next to three young pretty girls, so when the waiter even came within the vicinity of our table, they ignored us and walked to the table next to us instead.  I told my friends they needed to wear lower-cut shirts, so my advice to you would be to go with an excess of gorgeous girls if you want to eat any meat.

After spending two hours sitting around, most of us were still somewhat hungry.  Finally, around 30 minutes before they were about to close and with the restaurant clearing out, they finally realized we were sitting there waiting.  Suddenly I found a pile of 3 steaks on my plate, since the waiter saw we were maybe one of five tables left still eating.  The food was good, but it was really not worth the hassle.

Overall I give the food three stars and the service two stars.  Maybe if I had bothered to go back again, the service would have been better."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times now, the first time was a 5-star experience but that was more than a couple years ago. This time we went there for brunch and were going to use a Groupon, sadly the fine print said we could only use it AFTER 5PM - BE WARNED. So $19 for brunch, not so great a deal unless you are an anaconda or have a tapeworm. The food offered ranges from very good to so-so, the scrambled eggs and bacon were tepid, the potatoes were good with a bit too many peppers for my taste. The salad bar fruits and vegetables were very good, there were no croissants or muffins or Danish as advertised. The pastries and desserts were fine. The  rodizio meats: flank steak, ham and pork sausage were okay, nothing to write about. The coffee was very good. Atmosphere and service were excellent. 
All in all,  save $20 or $30 and go to Hy-Vee"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've dined here with friends and family numerous times. Check it out for yourself if you love meat.  Sunday brunch is awesome. I have had the pleasure of visiting Brazil and dining at the churrascarias and Samba is definitely authentic."}
{"text":"I have only been to Samba Grill for the Sunday brunch (not for dinner), and that brunch was amazing!  The salad bar was full of fresh delicious foods, including pastries, eggs, bacon, etc, but also all the wonderful salad stuff like hearts of palm, many selections of olives, and just so many things to try.  All the items were fresh looking and beautifully presented.

The meats on offer were excellent!  At our visit for brunch there were three meats plus grilled pineapple.  The pineapple was amazing.  The meats included delicious ham (extra amazing when eaten with the pineapple), a nice spicy sausage, and glory of glories - luscious flank steak - served medium rare and so juicy it just melted in your mouth.  The gaucho-clad waiters were pretty quick to make the rounds and we never felt neglected or stinted on the meat service.  

For the price and quality and quantity of the food, it was a good value for the money.  And the experience was great.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back again, but I'd make sure I was really hungry before hand!"}
{"text":"First, I'm a vegetarian writing this review so I think my grade of 4 goes a long way!

For vegetarians, the salad bar is nicely done with many fresh options.  And, the grilled pineapple that they slice table side is delicious.  The price for the salad bar alone is fair.

I took my mother and a friend and they both enjoyed the meat options immensely.  The pork was the only meat selection that they didn't care for (not the pork shoulder - that was incredible according to them).  

For the Madison area, this is a very nice spot and we would recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here on a thursday night. Their meat was pretty good. Staff was friendly. 
I would not recommend the place, neither would I dissuade people to go here.

The all you can eat is just a little pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"We took 7 college boys for a birthday outing here and were disappointed.  Our server was rude and didn't bring us the wine we ordered when we sat down until we were almost half way through our meal.  They claimed to be serving 8 different meats, but one never showed up, two were very mediocre at best, and the good ones only came to our table once.  We had to beg for them to return. Each time, they placed literally one bite on your plate and then didn't return for 15 minutes. For close to $400, we expected to be satisfied, but left still feeling hungry.  Something you wouldn't expect for \"all you can eat\". What it should read is \"all we will bring you\"."}
{"text":"Oh my god! I and a friend went there during the restaurant  week. You pay only $30 for thier grill and salad bar. I totally agree with  my friend  who said the salad bar here is awesome. There's  nothing served in the counter i don't  like even the goat cheese. I am really impressed with the varieties of foods here. Samba also provides many varieties of wine for you but not all of them  have been served in a glass. That's why i ended up with a glass of  Pinot noir from Chili instead of that of California.  For the grills, i like the leg of lamb, flank steak and cinnamon dusted pineapple the most. Generally  i am not a fan of cinnamon except for this time. Cinnamon  pineapple  is just compatible perfectly. Our server is a brazillian. I tried to catch her Protugese but i could  not.  However  i am glad that Madison  has Samba in the town. It is a superior  place for dining in.  The atmosphere  is also nice, perfect for dating  or groups of family and friend group as well. I strongly recommend you to take a great deal during the restaurant  week at Samba."}
{"text":"Food and service is pretty fantastic. We made reservations Friday night just in case there was a crowd, but luckily it was a pretty slow night.

It was our first time there, so the server explained the rules and the wooden hour glass. Green=Meat. Red =Salad/Break to Breathe.

The salad bar was pretty impressive. Lot of leafy green choices, nuts& berries, and cheeses. They also had potato salad and calamari salad. For hot foods, they had mashed potatoes, black beans, and meat stew. The server also gave us some bread balls ( I don't remember the actual name.) They look like donut holes, but are bread balls with cheese and tapioca filled center. Sounds weird, but absolutely delicious.

The meat, while very delicious and ranging in varieties, can also be a hit or miss. So be wary of that. Sometimes the meat may be too chewy and lack some flavor. But since the meat guys come around so often, you may very well get the same meat 15 minutes apart and they will taste drastically different.

Overall, this place is a must try, especially if you're in the area looking for a fancy place to eat."}
{"text":"I am from Brazil and I was surprised to find a churrascaria in Madison, WI, so I decided to give it a try. First experience I had when walk in was positive. Authentic Brazilian style environment. The environment was pleasant and it gave me a high expectation that the food would also be what I am use to. Well, it did not go as expected. The salad bar was OK. It lacked few authentic dishes such as the potato salads called (maionese) and another called salpicão. The feijoada was not pleasing. They also forgot the side dishes that goes with the feijoada. They are the farofa, oranges and sautéed collard green. On a positive note, they had a good variety of other types of salads. 
Now for the main reason why I was there. The meat!  They served the type of meat that I expected and with the right cut and the correct way it is placed on the skewer. What disappointed me a little was the way it was made. The picanha seemed to be marinated in wine. Not the way it is done. All you need is rock salt. That is it. The other meats had also a sweet taste to it. 
The only meat I liked was the lamb. It was very good. 
Overall, it was a different experience and I somewhat liked the food. It was not a true churrasco, but it was somewhat worth it."}
{"text":"We visited Samba during restaurant week.

I had been here once before, and thought it was pretty good (though quite pricey).

Our experience last night was very mediocre.  

HOSTESS AND SEATING:  We were greeted immediately and shown to our table -great!

SERVER: Our server arrived promptly, poured water and explained how it all works - great!

It went downill from there.

SALAD BAR:  There were many tasty items on the salad bar. I agree with others though, that the ingredients for an actual salad are limited, and there were two pretty unappealing dressing choices.  The hot food around the outside tasted good, but it was all served at about room temperature...not good - overall, the salad bar disappointed.

MEAT SERVICE:  We had several concerns about the meat service.  Most of the meat was served extremely rare, to the point of being almost raw, and not even warm.  Rubbery, cold, red lamb wasn't appealing to us.  Service was extremely uneven and very slow.  Sometimes we didn't see a gaucho for 10-15 minutes.  The gauchos seemed very inexperienced, were not particulary engaging (except the pineapple guy, he rocked!).  Of the 6 meat choices, only one really seemed great (the sirloin).

THE BILL:  We were in the restaurant for two hours (yes, waiting for more meat much of the time!).  Our server never came by with a bill.  It wasn't until we both used the restroom and put on our coats that she asked if we wanted the bill. 

BOTTOM LINE:  I'm glad we only paid $25/person.  I might consider going back again for this price in a few years, but definitely not for the regular price.

UPPING THEIR GAME:  Samba could really make this special if they paid attention to some details:  ensure the food is cooked properly and served hot, and put enough gouchos on staff to keep the meat coming to customers on a consistent basis.  Also, please encourage your gauchos to engage with the customers a bit, and ensure they are comfortable and experienced in their role...some of our guys really seemed scared wielding a large knife).

It wouldn't really take much to make the experience at Samba much better."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! 

My husband and I went to Samba last night, and when we walked in, we noticed that there weren't many people (most of the seats were empty), and there weren't that many gauchos running meat skewers - only two, which should be far too few for a Friday night... except there weren't too many people here.  

We've been to countless churracarias in the US and Brazil, so we are well familiar with the concept: there's usually a fabulous salad bar full of fresh fruit, salads, cheeses, cured meats, pickled veggies, and more. Occasionally, there'll be a hot dish bar. Samba fell short here - no fruit, no cold cuts, no vinagrette (a Brazilian chopped salad, as clasically churassaco as having potato salad or baked beans at an BBQ joint here), etc. It was very small - maybe 12 main options at the salad area, with two soups, rice and beans, mashed potatoes, and feijoada in the warm dish area. There was an ok selection of cheese (but hey, it's Wisconsin, I would expect that), and the balsamic goat cheese was pretty good. The rest of the salad choices were meh at best. 

When I returned from visiting the salad bar, the first guacho was serving my husband some picanha and one of the flank steaks. I was able to snag a piece, and it was not terrible - but nowhere near as good as I expect. Unfortunately, that was the best piece of meat I had all night. As the meal progressed, the meats become worse and worse. Everything starts getting an eggy taste that got stronger with each meat.

The pão de queijo eventually arrives .... but seems to be missing the cheese entirely. 

Eventually, we decided that we'd had enough, even though we weren't at all full, and that we'd find something to tide us over on the drive back to the hotel. $80 for unsatisfactory food, and a waste of time... we could have just gone to a traditional American steakhouse for that price, and gotten better food & service. I wish we had."}
{"text":"If you're going to go out, spend some money, don't go here. I've wanted to want to really want to like Samba. But after a few years and consistent gut rot afterwards, I'm going to retire this place from my list of options. Their Groupon deal is restrictive too so be careful! (doesn't include Fri or Sat). Meat quality and selection has waned in recent years, and... well, blah."}
{"text":"Their prices are now $39.95.  If you can buy the Bucky book in September when it comes out, this coupon (bogo) itself pays for the entire book!"}
{"text":"I was a brazilian steakhouse n00b as well. I've been dying to try Fogo de Chao, the apparent ruler of the brazilian steakhouse chain restaurant monopoly. The opportunity has yet to arise, however.

While in Milwaukee for the weekend, we decided to stop for lunch in Madison. I googled \"Madison Brunch\" and voila - I find that a Brazilian Steakhouse exists just off State street that has a $15 brunch!!!

It was fate. My boyfriend and I were hungover from a long afternoon of brewery hopping in Milwaukee the day before. A salad bar, in addition to four selections from the grill, sounded perfect.

Overall, we loved Samba. Super friendly and attentive staff that was neither condescending nor pushy; the manager checked in on us and we never had a problem getting what we needed from the wait staff or the meat dudes.

The restaurants itself is beautiful; a sister restaurant/bar something or other resides in the lower level of the equally-pretty-on-the-exterior building. They have a small lot but there is street parking and a city meter lot across the street.

Would definitely love to try Samba for dinner... the only meat I tried due to personal preference was the flank steak, which was delicious. Don't eat pork or ham, but the boyfriend loved those selections. The grilled pineapple was FABULOUS.

The salad bar was great and had some really delicious options. A good variety, although I will say that it was a smaller spread that what I've seen in photos and heard about other brazilian steakhouses. Nonetheless, it was more than enough selection for me: grilled veggies, baked goods, yogurt, salads, three hot items, bread, cheese, etc. 

You can also order waffles, which we did - they were delish! 

Totally worth $15 for brunch... + two drinks for a total of $45. Wonderful experience at Samba!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: We were there during the last day of a Groupon promotion, so the restaurant was really busy. 

I've eaten at Samba several times over the years, and was much more impressed when it was new. Some of that is to be expected, it's a lovely space and the concept was new to Madison. The building shows some wear (fix the damn front door, already!), but overall it's holding up well enough.

The star of the show is actually not the meat service, but the wonderful first course salad bar. Not a typical salad bar, but a meal in itself- I would go there for just the curried chicken salad and the popovers. I keep telling myself 'next time', but we always get meat as well.

The meats were fine- I recommend passing on the chicken legs and the chorizo, although it makes sense financially to offer lower cost cuts in addition to the steak and tenderloin (beef and pork). Beef is served on the rare side, so be aware, but it's quite tender and juicy.

Service was perfunctory, somewhat excusable for a Groupon night, but the server lost us for dessert by taking 10+ minutes to bring the dessert menu, and then disappearing for several more. That's the first time service has been rough, though."}
{"text":"First off, we cook a lot and well, so have somewhat high expectations. I was truly looking forward to this, as we don't eat a large amount of steaks, etc, so when we do, it needs to be good. 
While our server was nice, and had a great personality, it took forever to even get drinks, and my buddy didn't get his until we had started eating (appx 15 mins after ordering). As others have stated, there was very few Gauchos bringing food through, and it seemed that the cheapest cuts were brought. In fact, of the 11 or so they advertise, we only had perhaps 6 brought by in the VERY long time we were there. As I looked into the cooking area, very few skewers were being cooked even. The vast majority of the meats were overcooked, and marinades were for the most part terribly overbearing. The salad bar is nice, and imaginative, but for the price, the experience is a bit ridiculous. Awesome decor, good beer selection, but terribly disappointing and I would MUCH rather eat at home and have 5 or 6 meals for the same price. The impression I left with is that they must be on their last legs....
Save lots of money and find a better place to dine."}
{"text":"I love it here. Try the tres leches desert"}
{"text":"Was excited to check out this Brazilian Grill for our date night. We've eaten at other Brazilian Grills numerous times. While in our Lyft to the restaurant our driver made conversation around the restaurant style. I happened to say we love these style restaurants for their fun atmosphere and outstanding service. Apparently, my expectations were set too high by Fogo and Texas de Brazil. The service at Samba was mediocre, at best. I believe we saw our server three times, once was to bring us the check. Our salad plates weren't cleared and we weren't offered clean plates when the meat service started. The sides that are typically brought to your table in the other restaurants needed to be fetched from the salad bar area. The wait time for meat service was incredibly long as compared to the other two restaurants. If you're charging the same price per person as the other Brazilian restaurants, the service needs to come along too! This place has great potential if they beef up their staff."}
{"text":"OMG!

This place is awesome.  ALL of the food was superb.  I love the red/green barbells for the tables to let the servers know when you're ready for more.  Everything we ate was awesome, but I think they could just keep throwing slabs of the grilled pineapple at me and I would have been happy.

Food, drinks, friends - this place has it all.  I never knew it existed until my last trip to Maddison.  Now it will be a regular stop when I'm in town."}
{"text":"$15 for the Sunday Brunch Buffet? Hercules Hercules!!! You  will probably not get a better value for Sunday morning breakfast than here.

First and foremost the decor is uber classy - something you'd expect from the standards set by Brazzazz, Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil. They even had a $10.25/hr Madison student playing live keyboards to set the mood.

The buffet has two courses - the salad bar and the gauchos coming around with the meat. The salad bar didn't have many standouts. It was more or less rabbit food (nuts, cheeses, vegetables, etc) with the exceptions of scrambled eggs, home potatoes and thick cut bacon. That made up for a good $7.50 of the bill which you would normally pay at a breakfast diner. 

The second course included ham, flank steak, sausage and a cinammon glazed pineapple. IMO the sausage was the best. The ham was a little dry and the steak was lackluster. The pineapple was decent but no way as delectable as Brazzazz's. Either way, I've had better at other Brazilian all you can eats. However the question is - can you get all of this stuff for $15? No way in Chicago, I'll tell you that.

Round it out with these donut hole sized focaccia breads (with an interesting gooey texture inside), waffles made to order and your choice of $3 Mimosas or Bloody Mary's and you have a steal.

Definitely recommended.

Tidbits: It seems the custom of serving a Bloody Mary with a beerback is a Wisconsin only thing. 

The place is also right off of State Street which makes a lovely stroll after gorging very appealing."}
{"text":"We went for a 5:30pm reservation and walked into a mostly empty restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly and checked in on us throughout the night. We also never ran out of water (which is a major thing for me).

There is a salad and side dish bar, on the main floor. The food there was very tasty and well prepared. The meat is grilled over a fire, off to the side, on large skewers. As each cut of meat is done grilling, the servers will carry the skewer around from table to table, offering you cuts of the meat.

We occasionally had to wait for various cuts to make their way to us and some cuts definitely came by more often than others. On the plus side, most of the cuts were very tasty and the servers would pass along our requests for which cut we wanted to get next (or soon).

I appreciated the fact that each of the individual cuts is small, enough for just 3 or 4 bites. Like The Melting Pot (another favorite restaurant of mine), this forces you to eat slowly and really appreciate both the food and the company you're with. It slows down the meal, which is very nice. It also gives me the freedom to eat until I'm full without feeling like I have a certain set amount that I need to finish.

All in all, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was not a long wait for a Saturday night. My girlfriend and I loved the salad bar and the tastefulness of the meat. Would definitely comeback, but bring a bigger appetite."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I came here for our anniversary.  I loved the building and the atmosphere right away.  It looked like a converted theater and felt very intimate.  We were seated and greeted immediately.  The unlimited salad bar was first.  There was so much food to pick from!  I liked the variety, the different salad dressings, and I loved the mashed potatoes.  I had to remind myself that this was only the first course and limited the amount of food I took.  Everything was delicious and I ate pretty much everything I took.  Next was the meat course, my favorite!  I'm pretty sure I tried every kind of meat they had.  I was not a huge fan of the pork or the lamb.  I felt they were not very flavorful.  However, the top sirloin and the picanha were delicious.  I had chimichanga sauce to eat with the meat which really added a lot of flavor.  We were checked on often, and when I requested a certain type of meat (more picanha), it came very quickly.  This place is pricey, but it's great for special occasions, or restaurant week!  This is the second Brazilian steakhouse I've eaten at, and I think the other one was just a little better."}
{"text":"Excellent salad bar, superb meats, get ready for a food coma. Each night they bring around 8-9 differnt cuts of meat. They usually ask if we have requests as well. Great service. Yes, it is a bit pricey and I would go a lot more if it weren't so much."}
{"text":"This place was reccomended by a colleague, and was phenominal! Best meat around! The flank steak and parmesan crusted pork are to die for. The name \"salad bar\" doesnt do this array of goodies any justice. This is a must stop! Atmosphere is cozy and fun. The mojitos are made from scratch and original. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here for both brunch and dinner. Both times, everything was just amazing! With 5 - 7 types of meat, plus grilled pineapple and a salad bar that could be a 5 star dinner all on it's own, this is my favorite all-you-can-eat place. They had Mongolian beef as one of the meats, and it practically melted in my mouth it was so tender!

They play live jazz during dinner, which I don't like. But that's a personal music preference thing and I can appreciated that they they play live music, even if it is jazz. Also, it's not obnoxiously loud so I can ignore it pretty easily.

The restrooms are clean and have tiny, prettily wrapped mints to freshen your breath after all the savory food. The toilet stall walls go all the way down to the floor, so it's like you're in a little toilet-closet which gives you actual privacy.

Price-wise, it's a tad spendy, about $70 for dinner with a drink for two people. I think it's completely worth it for a special date or celebration. For an indulgent breakfast, the brunch menu is just as fabulous and has a lower price tag, about $40 for the meal and drinks for two."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night with a Groupon I had recently bought. Being new to Groupon, I hadn't checked the fine print terribly closely, and the waitress brought to my attention that it is supposed to only be valid Monday through Thursday. Needless to say, I was really disappointed, but the server said she would check with her manager and let us know. 
My boyfriend and I enjoyed our meal. Some highlights from the salad bar were the flavorful grilled zucchini, the seesame-ginger dressing, and the pesto pasta salad. There was a Brazilian stew which was also excellent (with black beans, sausage, and lengua). The meats were also mostly tasty, though the pork was a bit dry, and one of the steak options was overcooked as well. Gotta love that grilled pineapple with cinnamon and sugar! 
Anyway, our bill came, and the server kind of put it down and ran away. I took a look at it, and saw no mention of the discount, so I flagged her down. She again stated that for future reference that this is only supposed to be vaild during the week...but then she accepted the discount! I was so relieved. Gotta appreciate that flexibility."}
{"text":"Samba was the perfect date night spot. One of the pros is that they still take reservations, which is becoming rarer among restaurants these days. The wine list is huge, so many choices from different countries. Good for wine enthusiasts (but beware, some wines only come by the bottle). The salad bar was amazing. We were raving about it all dinner. The second course was also pretty great. It's nice to be able to experience different small samples of meats in one meal to be able to taste everything. The pineapple was my favorite because it really cleaned the palette in between the meat and doubled as a dessert because it's so sweet. Even if you're not a huge fan of pineapple, try it at least once. Fortunately we had a groupon so we had a good discount but since you're eating just protein, it doesn't take a lot to get full so you don't feel like you've eaten your money's worth. This is a restaurant for a special occasion or when you're feeling a splurge."}
{"text":"After some serious window shopping on State Street. My 4 girlfriends and I chose this place for dinner because of a street sign that advertised their Friday special -- all you can eat fish tacos. 

The tacos were small. The fish stick in the tortilla was small and on the greasy side.  The fried fish was covered with one spoon of chopped tomato salsa and you had a spicy sauce and white rice on the side. That is it, nothing fancy.  Each time the waitress brought out 2 tacos and after 4 each she just stopped asking if we wanted more. To tell you the truth I could easy put away 6 of those  things. 

This place did its job I was no longer hungry when I left. 
Next when I am in town I will pass on the fish tacos and maybe try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"I don't believe I have ever been as disappointed in a restaurant as I was tonight. I really didn't know it was possible to screw up meat so badly. The pork tenderloin was so dry it was inedible. The spicy beef tenderloin was unbelievably tough and was so spicy you couldn't even taste the meat but maybe that is the point.

The flavor of the sirloin wasn't bad but the texture was mealy. The flank steak was poorly marinated, one bite was all spice, the next was all vinegar and was also overly tough. The lamb was also severely over seasoned but could've been good. 

The highlight of the night and the only reason I didn't give Samba one star was the chicken legs. And the best item they serve, the grilled pineapple.

Seriously, you're a restaurant that specializes in grilled meats and the only thing you do well is pineapple?!?

I really hate leaving a review like this but if you are going to charge $37 for a meal, you need to be able to actually make decent food."}
{"text":"Lamb was my favorite, but every thing else they offered was a close second. Pineapple was amazing. Very clean place, really makes you feel important"}
{"text":"I went to this place around 3 years ago, the food was so good that i almost felt asleep on the table from eating so much.Definitely recommend it !!!!"}
{"text":"Not much meat selection,  really slow,  even though,I wasn't crowded.  The meat was really some poor cuts. Ie sirloin.   The salad bar was boring. I have to say I came Here about a year ago and was really impressed."}
{"text":"Very good food!   Pricy but worth every dollar!!  This place is a must with their unique salad bar, and meat choices, and oh yeah the desserts!!! (if you can save room before you are full)

The only suggestion is for the employees to watch out on texting their friends and grabbing pieces of meat and walking in the back in the preparation area. (it is very visible from the second floor balcony seating area!)

Otherwise I am am likelong customer there!"}
{"text":"The meats were all great. The salad bar was fine. But the service was not what I would have expected. The host was rude and the server was constantly rushed. I have worked in the restaurant industry in years past and I understand that things can get crazy. But when I'm dishing out $150 for my wife and I to have a nice Christmas dinner, I expect a friendly host and an accompanying waitress. 

I usually love this type of Brazilian steak house. But I won't be back here. Too many other great places in Madison to give my money to."}
{"text":"Not a great experience and an expensive disappointment !!!!

The meat was mediocre at best and mostly cold by the time it got to our table on the rare occasion it did get to our table.
the servers with the meat only give you a couple of bites worth then do not come back for another 10-15 minutes later.
Some of the meat items came only once and never again. The flank steak (very tough) was the one coming back the most (3 times).
We had to ask and wait for some of the items on the salad bar.
there was no background music at all; the experience was very lousy.

In summary, if you have very low expectations you may like this place, although for the money $35/person I consider this to be an expensive disappointment !!!
I will not go back and I will make sure to till my friends to go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"recently went to samba with high expectations, boy, was i disappointed. the meat was all overcooked, dry, and had a strange taste due to the marinade they used..the salad bar had some interesting and tasty items but if you were there just for the salad, it was overpriced..(as was the meat)..the decor was ok., the service was slow but the servers were pleasant and helpful.  would not recommend this as a place to go if you are truly looking for good beef."}
{"text":"I went here during Restaurant week, Jan '10.  I had a seat for two in the bar area because I didn't have reservations.  A more relaxed dinning experience would have been preferable, but I was glad to be seated nonetheless.

The meal started off with a waiter explaining the rules or set-up of the place.  It starts with a clean plate to be filled up at the salad bar.  They had a decent selection of fresh greens and prepared condiments and goodies.  I especially liked the dry figs and goat cheese at the end. 

Next came the meat.  The meat was mediocre.  I couldn't really taste any of the meat.  While the spices were good, and the chimichurri sauce was tasty, the meat was lacking actual animal flavor.  The top sirloin was dry here, moist there.  The pork tenderloin was especially disappointing because it made me question whether it was tenderloin or just loin.  IT WAS LOIN.  I do not like being lied to.

Add a bottle of wine at $22, the total for two came up to $80.  It's not worth it.  The meat didn't come around as quickly or often as I would have liked.  The salad bar, while good, is not sufficient enough for me to fork over $25.  I can't imagine having paid full price.  Oh, and there was no duck. LAME."}
{"text":"I love Churascarias.  Having visited Rio and Sao Paulo, I think I know what a good one is.  The waiters and gauchos were very attentive.  The price point is a good value compared to nationwide chains like Fogo de chao and Texas du Brazil.  I will be back here again on my future visits to Madison."}
{"text":"I was less than thrilled with the service. We saw several meat options once, and some not at all. I make better mashed potatoes at home. No dressings for the salads. The steaks that were brought over were often too rare for the tastes of my wife and I as well as several others at our table, although they eventually started bringing more well cooked options. After gratuity (which was included on our bill,) we payed $95 for a poor experience. My wife, who wanted white meat options brought up, left hungry after getting a small piece of chicken and two small servings of parmesan pork (I took pity on her and gave her mine.)

EDIT: The staff from Samba did contact me several weeks later to apologize for the poor service.  As such, I have given them 2 stars from my previous 1."}
{"text":"Really people? My rating's as low as it can go to offset all the people raving about this place.

The salad bar is... pretty good. As for the meat? There was only one cut of meat that I loved. All the rest were mediocre at best (and some were just tough. and chewy. and my jaw hurts thinking about it. oww). I mean, I feel like I could've done better... and last time I checked, I wasn't a cook by any stretch of imagination.

I'm a fatty so I'm allllllll for all-you-can-eat meat but you won't see me ever going back to Samba. Not even if someone else is paying. I'd much rather get a steak at Tornado Room or Magnus. Hell, I'd rather have a Big Mac from McDonald's. At least with Mickey D's, I know I'm getting what I paid for. I used to be a vegetarian for years but after a semester in Madrid, haven't looked back. However, if Samba had been my reintroduction to meat, I would've stayed a vegetarian. Ok. That's all. Bye."}
{"text":"I have been to Samba a handful of times over the past five years. It has never been at the top of my list for restaurants to attend. In fact, the only reason I have attended this restaurant the last few times we have gone is because of a groupon (2) and because a group of friends wanted to go. I feel like this place is on its last legs. 

From start to finish it was a constant blunder. We showed up at 6:45 on a Sunday night and they were slammed. The hostess said she \"would definitely have us seated by 7:10.\" I didn't ask for such specificity, but okay, cool. 

We waited in the empty bar. We were the only two people there. It took our bartender 15 min to get us a glass of wine and a mojito. I sat there waiting to pay another 10 min. When the bartender finally took my card she sat it down on her cutting board where they slice the fruit and proceeds to finish making two more drinks for other tables. She called me sweetly and honey several times, which I found very disrespectful. She finally back my alcohol and juice covered credit card. End of that story. 

The hostess finally comes to seat us at 7:20. We sit down and the waiter shows up after about a five min wait. I ordered a glass of wine. About 20 min later we had to ask for it again. Our waiter then tells us he has a large section and he is sick. I'm sorry, but I don't really feel like getting sick either. I seriously question the health practices there. 

The food is pretty static. It's grilled meats and a fancy salad bar. It's really not bad. The flank steak, Parmesan pork and lamb are all pretty decent. 

The place is a little pricey. Couple glasses of wine, two dinners and tip will put you over $100. The wines by the glass are weak."}
{"text":"Ever since it lived in the Madison area I've been looking to stop here. If you've been to a Brazilian meat restaurant before, it's a similar experience. You get a paddle with red and green. Green means to keep the meat coming. Red means you need a break. 

The salad bar area had a nice variety of cold cuts, cheeses, salads, and other appetizers. They had roughly 8 different types of marinated meats. While there were a couple I didn't care for, there were some that knocked it out of the park. 

Come hungry because you'll leave full! This is a nice date restaurant. Great atmosphere and service. This is worth the visit if you're looking for something different in Madison!"}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. We arrived 45 minutes early for a 7:15 reservation. It was packed. My wife waited in line for 10-15 minutes just to check in. She got to the front and was told our name wasn't 'in the system'. My wife brought out her cell phone and offered to show her the reservation. The woman refused to even look at it. The woman was rude and dismissive. She said we could come back at 9:30. Like I'm going to wait nearly three hours to eat dinner (I also had my 12 year old son with us). 

Absolute, complete joke! No apology, no attempt to try and rectify the situation. 

Never again for this place."}
{"text":"The meat quality was exceptionally poor, as I could barely swallow the meat.  The service was painfully slow as well."}
{"text":"The format is the same as most every other Brazilian Steakhouse we've been to in the U.S. There is a set price which includes the buffet and all of the meats. Drinks and desserts if you choose to have them are extra.

We arrived fairly late on a Saturday evening. We had reservations and were seated immediately. Samba was busy but not crowded. Our waitress arrived shortly, brought a basket of yucca puffs filled with cheese, took our drink order, explained how it works, and then we headed toward the salad bar. 

The salad bar has a good selection of both hot and cold items. I thought the swiss, brick, and blue cheeses were all top notch. There were regular and spicy almonds. Spinach, mixed greens, romaine were all available for making a cold salad. Marinated artichokes and hearts of palm made for some tasty and unusual ingredients. There was a chickpea salad, a curried potato salad, and a pesto pasta salad with sun-dried tomatoes. A couple of soups were available and well as an incredibly delicious lamb and black-bean stew which I devoured. This wasn't the most extensive salad bard I've seen at a Brazilian steak-house, but it contained a good mix of traditional american items with a good mix of Brazilian items to please all tastes. The hardest part about the salad bar is making sure you leave for all of the meats to come.

The evening we were there, the skewers of meats included, a sausage, mango chicken, garlic chicken wings, pork w/Parmesan cheese, flank steak, sirloin steak, lamb and pineapple (obviously not a meat, but served like one). The lamb, sirloin, and pork were all delicious. They were brought around multiple times and you could have multiple servings each time if you so desired. The flank steak was a little tough and was not my favorite until I got some chimichurri sauce from the salad bar. Wow! This was great! I should have gotten this from the beginning. It's a green sauce of parsley, garlic, olive oil, oregano, and vinegar. It really matched the flank steak and made it sing.

Our beverages were also very good. Cachaca and rum were the primary liquors. They were delicious, large, and priced as you would expect at fine-dining restaurant.

We didn't save room for the desserts. They are extra - in the $7 - $10 range.

This isn't a place I would go every week. It's just too much food and you are paying for it. But, I will definitely go back. Just make sure you are particularly hungry and hungry for a lot of meat."}
{"text":"Ii fortunately we had a totally inept waitress with the  initials KD.  She took our drink order then left for good. I hailed the hostess to get it ten minutes later and a kind bus boy got us refills.  Good thing she did remember the drinks she never filled on our bill.  Otherwise the food was great and plentiful!  Too bad a poor service delivery put a damper on our experience there."}
{"text":"WARNING: This review is intended for meat lovers only. Content not appropriate for vegetarians.

Anyways, like most South American styled steakhouses, Samba's is a 2 course all-you-can-eat paradise for meat lovers. 

The first course consisted of a salad and soup bar, which can be ordered as a standalone meal. I actually think it's not a bad deal in and of itself, but with a few more dollars (like $15+ more), you can get some nice quality meat. 

My favorites from the salad bar: 
Sweet, soft figs
Perfectly spiced roasted almonds and brazil nuts
Creamy, aromatic goat cheese
Chunky, flavorful feijoada (beef stew)
Soup of the day, which in my case, was cream of chicken and broccoli

Now on to the main course, which consisted of 8 different kinds of meat, and their cinnamon sugar coated pineapple. The meats include 4 different types of steak, mango chicken, marinated lamb, pork tenderloin and spiced pork sausage.

Let's start with the lightweights:

The spiced pork sausages were overly salty, which really overwhelmed any of its other spices.

The mango chicken wasn't very mango-y, and it was a bit dry. 

The pork tenderloin really wasn't bad, but was completely overshadowed by the steak tenderloin.

Now on to the heavyweights:

First, I just want to mention all the beef were cooked medium, and because of the grilling method, all sides were cooked evenly. 

Marinated beef tenderloin: large chunks of thick and juicy meat.

Top sirloin: very much like the tenderloin, but not as flavorful, because of the hardness of the meat. 

New York strip: thinly cut slices of tender beef with perfectly charred sides. Because this was the most fatty, it was the most flavorful of the beef choices. The skin was also charred enough to give it a bacon-like taste (which to me, was awesome, cause bacon = awesome)

Flank steak: like the top sirloin, it loses out to its more tender cousin, the New York strip, due to taste. 

And finally, my favorite:

Marinated leg of lamb and cinnamon sugar crusted pineapple. The lamb's onion and baharat spice was absolutely delicious. I feel that good lamb should always be rubbed in baharat.

The cinnamon sugar pineapple was slightly heated, with the cinnamon firmly soaked inside. I think I really enjoyed this just because it offered something different from the copious amount of meat. 

My only issue with this place was that I wish they had more sauces. Because all the meats were grilled, they can sometimes come off as being too dry. Having some more sauce to balance that out would have been perfect.

Also, the 4 different kinds of beef were a bit overkill... first world problems I guess?

Overall, if you wanted to stuff yourself with some great quality meat, then this is probably the perfect place for you. However, I don't think I could do another trip here. It's just a bit... too much. 

PS: Too many animals were harmed in the making of this dinner."}
{"text":"I've heard people rave about Brazilian steakhouses, and I finally went with high hopes, but left really quite disappointed. My overall impression is that Samba is a steak and other assorted meats buffet, but a pain in the ass because you have to wait for someone to come by and cut off an appetizer-sized portion of meat - and you pay through the nose for it.

The taste of some of the food is ok. You start with a buffet of salads, breads, stews. I got some chicken tort (not good), Wisconsin cheeses (good, but you can get them anywhere in the area for cheap), and cheese-filled rolls (excellent). But you should probably not fill up too much, since the real experience is in the meats and pineapple that the servers bring to your table.

At Samba, you flip a big red/green plastic thing to indicate when you want food. If you have it green side up, then servers will come by your table and cut off a modestly sized piece of meat or pineapple and so on, until you flip your thing back over to red so you can eat. The sausage was quite good. The leg of lamb was cooked well, but the meat was a bit too gamey for my liking. The top sirloin was disappointing as hell - there were a couple decent bites, but the slices I got were mostly overcooked and some pieces were loaded with inedible gristle. The pineapple has cinnamon and sugar, and just tastes like warm pineapple with cinnamon and sugar (assuming you get a piece with cinn and sugar on it, which only outside pieces have). I was greatly disappointed by a few of the meats, like marinated flank steak and honey chicken. With the exception of the sausage which was quite good but not special, I was overall pretty disappointed. I am not Brazilian and am not an expert, but I have had Brazilian food before. If you didn't tell me that Samba was Brazilian, I would never have guessed it was supposed to be.

Critically: Caipirinhas are like the drink of Brazil, and the one I had at Samba was the worst one I ever had. That's disappointing since they're one of my favorite cocktails.

The service was sloowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. We were there at a 5pm on Thursday (they open at 5pm) and the place wasn't getting full until we just about finished our meal, but it still took forever for our drinks to get refilled, get our bill, etc. I don't blame our waitress so much, it seemed like she just had a lot of tables to take care of. I think if you're charging $37 or whatever a plate, you can afford to hire adequate staff.

Overall, as many other Yelp! reviewers have already said, the quality of food does not justify the price. My fiance and I had two dinners, two Caipirinhas, and a fountain drink, which cost us over $100. And it was in no way worth $100, let alone even half that. If I were to ignore the price, I'd give Samba 2 Stars, but I can't rate them at any more than 1 given the high price for pedestrian food."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this weekend, and overall it is a good restaurant, great food, but my total was still $77 + $12 tip!! So, $35 Groupon + $22 + $12, for only 2 people, no dessert, no drinks. VERY Pricey if you compare to Rodizio (Milwaukee), and Fogo de Chao (Chicago). The only thing I didn't like was at the end, where the server reminded us to tip on the overall total before she added the Groupon...I thought that was kind of rude."}
{"text":"If you are a red-blooded carnivore like I am, then this is the place for you. I went with 4 other people who more or less agreed with me.

The atmosphere here was pretty good. If you have never been to a Brazilian Grill before, this is a good start. They walk around with skewers of meat and you say whether you want it or not based on a \"traffic light system\". Green means go, red means stop giving me more meat. After they see your table has a green, they stop by with a skewer of meat. They ask you if you would like some and then give it to you or they don't, depending on how you respond. 

The food is delicious. The have rack of lamb, duck, parmesan breaded pork chops, honey pork chops, flank steak, top sirloin, sausage and some others that I am probably forgetting. I was not impressed too much by the honey pork chops, but they were still good. The rest was mouth watering, especially the top sirloin.

The hostess was very kind. It seemed like a busy night and we were told initially that we would have to wait nearly 2 1/2 hours to get in. She said immediately after that she would try to get us in. Not 5 minutes later, we were sitting down.

The waitress was far below par. It took nearly 5 minutes for her to show up and then the drink delivery was even worse. Three of our drinks came within 10 minutes. Another 2 came about 5 minutes later and then the last one we had to ask for several times. We were halfway done with eating when it finally came. We also had to ask for water each time we needed it and when you are eating more meat than you have seen in your life, you need a lot of water to wash it down.

There was also a salad bar, which they must have put in just to ease people's minds that they were eating as much meat as they could handle. They had several cheeses that were declicious, but they were out of bread, so I had nothing to eat it with. I did not partake in the actual salad portion, so no review there.

It is also very pricey, 33$ for a meal, 17$ for just the salad bar. Drinks weren't too outrageous. They had tap beer for anywhere from 3$ to 6$. They had a very extensive wine list, but I also did not partake in that. 

This would have received a 5 star, had it no been for our horrible waitress."}
{"text":"Went to Samba during Restaurant Week. It was going to be my second time eating here. I did enjoy my first experience, so I figured I'd stop by again. They had the all you can eat salad bar and the endless meat for the Restaurant Week price of $30. I tried the \"Batida\" cocktail which was a passion fruit drink. Extremely sweet. I had this cocktail not too long ago during my first experience, and I don't remember it being so sweet. Maybe my palate has changed? The salad bar had great options. The black beans were tasty! Reminded me of Cuban style black beans with garlic and onions. The meats that happened to stop by my table were okay. Out of the mediocre meats, I liked most the \"Picanha.\" I'm a fan of fat on meat and this cut had that. I do remember it tasting better the first time I came here as well. I also remeber the pork sausage that I got to try. It was really greasy, so I took one bite and had enough. The sausage tasted good, but was just too greasy for my liking. Overall, the meats were mediocre, and I do not believe I got to try every meat they had. I was seated in a small semi-private room, so I did feel a bit neglected at times. However, I did not leave hungry and I would give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Since I was born and raised in Brazil, I figured I'd check out Samba to see how authentic they really are.

The concept (rodizio) is certainly Brazilian. The way that some of the meats are seasoned is \"sort of\" like we do in Brazil. The feijoada (black beans with pork pieces) is close enough to the Brazilian recipe, though not nearly as good as it could be. They have farofa (yucca flower with some seasoning) and it's pretty authentic. The cheese bread \"looks\" Brazilian, but the flavor and texture were far from the real deal. I heard that people go there for the grilled pineapple, which is fine, but not great.

Now... The meat variety is extremely limited. That said, I did not expect them to offer as many cuts as we do in Brazil. I did, however, hope that they would be pretty close to what other Brazilian steakhouses in the US offer (I'm thinking of Plataforma, Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil). Samba fails miserably on this category (the most important for a \"steak\" house). Moreover, the Gauchos did not know how to cut the meats properly. For example, the top sirloin (picanha) is supposed to be sliced super thin... I got a couple of very thick pieces.

The buffet is okay... I guess it caters well to the local demographic. It does not stand up to Brazilian standards though.

The service was the best part. My waiter was very attentive, friendly and prompt.

Overall, Samba is \"sort of\" a Brazilian steakhouse. The food is not bad, but really nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Samba is really expensive, considering how mediocre the service is.  I went for brunch recently and the hostess (an older woman) wouldn't seat us until our entire party had arrived (who were just looking for parking, which we told her).  I don't mind this policy when a restaurant is at capacity, but there were at least a dozen EMPTY tables.  She also wouldn't take our coats until our party had arrived!?!?  
     My partner can put food away, so we've been here several times, but for anyone with a normal appetite you can feel compelled to absolutely GORGE yourself to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse prior to this so was not sure what exactly to expect. The ambiance was really great and the servers/meat cutters were exceptional. 

There is a salad bar that you get to fill up on unlimited number of times and it isn;t just salad...they had meat stew, mashed potatoes, white rice, cheese platters, several different types of salad, and these yummy pastry things they serve when you sit down. 

After filling up on the salad bar, you can begin your carnivorous session where meat is cut for you at your table. There were about 8 different types/cuts of meat the night we went (2 chicken, 1 linguica, and about 5 different steaks). All of them were REALLY good. We also really liked the grilled pineapple with cinnamon and sugar. 

The one recommendation I can make is to go when you are really hungry and don't overdo it on the salad bar. We were all so full when we left that we could barely move!!"}
{"text":"So they do the Brazilian steakhouse thing, I'm sure if you are reading this you know what that entails.

Their salad/buffet is pretty good with the bean stew and octopus salad standing out.

The Meat service varies, usually there is one or two that are tasty and well seasoned (asian tenderloin and the flank steak have both been great) but then the others are hit and miss, usually being bland.

But my real gripe is mostly that they seem somewhat stingy with the meat.  I have been to other Brazilian stekhouses and ate and drank for hours, running up a considerable bill of course but having a great time.  At Samba I get a real feeling that they want you to leave after trying everything once.  I can get a great steak at a few places in Madison (Tornado room comes to mind) for a similar price and while the variety is nice I go to one of these places for a long slow feast, not a quick sampler.  I'm sure it makes them more if you don't eat as much and get out to make room faster but that does not seem like my problem, especially at the price."}
{"text":"A solid Brazilian steakhouse experience. The interior is really nicely decorated, service was a little slow when I went because of a groupon deal they had going on but that was ok because I couldn't eat meat that quickly anyway. 

The food was really good overall.They had a lot of different choices. The flank steak, filet mignon, and lamb in particular were tender and flavorful. Nothing was too dry or overcooked, though some of the garlic or parmesan crusted pork and chicken were a little too salty for me. The salad bar has some good options for cleansing your palate and adding some crunch to your meal, and the grilled pineapple and cheesy rolls were awesome. 

It is a bit pricey, to be expected, but I would come again the next time I want to splurge a bit and eat until I can't move."}
{"text":"Meat fest, meat galore, Sambalicious!!

Samba is a pretty good Brazilian bbq, all-you-can-eat restaurant. There is a decent selection of meats and cuts, as well as a sizable salad bar. Unfortunately, the number of sides is limited to one -- the cheesy bread, which I don't have a problem with.

The funny thing is, I believe the most clutch item at Samba isn't even a meat; rather, it's the grilled cinnamon pineapple. It is absolutely delicious (and I think it helps with digestion). Take it from an avid meat-lover.

Overall, although there may be better Brazilian bbq places elsewhere, I appreciated the fact that Madison had one of its own. I also celebrated my recovery from wisdom teeth removal here."}
{"text":"This is not the type of place you might consider for a wedding reception, but it worked beautifully for our daughter and her husband.  We gave them money for the wedding and told them any money left over was theirs to keep for starting their new life together.  The last thing a newly married couple needs is wedding debt.

We had about 60 people for the reception, and the cost was about $4,500. That included the rental of the entire floor, private bar with free drinks, private bathrooms, servers dedicated to our party, the entire Samba experience described in other yelp posts, and wedding cake that was served. Food kept coming until we said no more.

Nothing was rushed.  It was all very friendly and relaxed.  We complimented the manager and staff on how they handled this most important occasion. The focus for us could appropriately be on visiting with wedding guests and the couple because the staff managed everything else."}
{"text":"Service could have been a little better, but overall not too bad for a Brazilian steakhouse in Madison."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch here is quite the steal!  Last Sunday's early gorging was the perfect ending to a weekend in Madison.  The facade of this place looks like it was taken off the beachfront.  You walk in and the ambiance takes you away.  They have a very intimate setting and quite the spread to boot!  The place has a definite shwanky feel to it.

They serve a pretty awesome salad bar with more of those uppercrust items such as sun dried tomatoes and fancy soaked artichoke hearts.  They have the usual scrambled eggs to accompany some smashing potatoes and perfectly toasted bacon - seriously, this bacon was awesome... not fatty, quite crisp and mmm-mmm good. 

We were seated promptly and made our way over to the salad bar after our waitress explained to us how the system worked - we were obvious newb's.  Everything at the salad bar was fresh.  The gentleman serving us were dressed up like some sort of urban cowboys and delivered flank steak, sausage, sweet grilled pineapple, and ham.  The food was not necessarily outstanding, but it was pretty good and endless servings of pretty good food almost guarantees that I'll be a fan.

They also offer belgian waffles.  I decided to not stuff myself to the point of uncomfortable-ness... this time.... so I did not get to sample these however, they looked delish!  I did get to indulge with a spicy $3 bloody mary though.  I think I could have drank those all day; they so hit the spot.  At the end of the day,  I highly recommend the Samba brunch buffet to anyone stopping through Madison."}
{"text":"Definitely pricey, but the food is excellent!  You could almost make a meal out of the salad bar alone (and that is an option).  All of the meats were amazing...definitely try the pineapple though too.  The staff was very attentive.  We actually turned the marker over for a bit to have time to eat because the gauchos were coming to the table so quickly.  Save room for dessert as well...my husband and I shared the flan and his aunt and uncle shared the tres leches.  Both were more than enough."}
{"text":"If you up for something new and have a hearty appetite, this might be a good place to check out.

Offering both a vegetarian option and a meat option - The Brazillian Grill allowed our whole group an option. First, the building is from 1910 (or close to) but it is beautifully restored. Great atmosphere and a comfy feel. We sat on some nice couches in the downstairs bar - which had good prices and good service. 

The main dining room was impressive and had a great feel. We were a little bummed out to find the 'stage' empty as they sometimes offer live music. We went on a Saturday night pretty much expecting it, but was told that they have music more on weeknights to try to draw people on less busy nights. 

Dinners basically split into two 'acts' the salad bar -- which is set up as a buffet and offers a large variety of items. Most were not your run of the mill and everyone in our group enjoyed trying different things. The next was the meat - and the Goucho's would come around with skewers of different meats to try. Our group sampled everyone that was offered. Our favorite by far was the Flank Steak which had a wonderful flavor and was very tender. Bacon wrapped filets were probably second favorite. 

Over all a very good time - The only two things bad I can say is that because of its location parking can be a problem. They do have an attached lot, but it was full we went. There is a public lot a half block up -- but this was also hard to get into and the meters only allowed for 2 hour parking. The second thing was our waitress. Although the Goucho's were great, we did have a waitress to bring us drinks and explain what was going on. She was slow and massively screwed up our bill when we tried to run it on separate cards. Fortunately she was a minor screw up in a good night of fun."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for Samba, but we will be going back Groupon or not. Great food and drinks. The price fits for the fare. Looking forward to returning"}
{"text":"The food was good, but WAY overpriced.  I really like the concept of no menu with a buffet for sides and waiters that come around offering you meat.  I felt bad for the guy who had chicken since I imagine many people decline chicken in favor of the lamb and various steak options.  However, it was $37/ person which is definitely overpriced for the quality of the food considering you can get a much higher quality entree for a similar price at L'Etoile or Harvest.  I would only recommend going here if you are extremely hungry and you really want to be able to eat right away without having to wait to place an order.  I don't plan on returning despite the beautiful atmosphere and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"We went on sun. and it was awesome. Food was executed perfectly. I'm usually skeptical on buffets, but this one was fresh and delicious. The salad bar has a lot more than salads and the meats are all seasoned very well. Excellent cocktails as well. I recommend the mojitos and caiprihinas. A stellar deal for restaurant week too! Awesome for a big group too."}
{"text":"This was my first time there but not my last . It is a little pricey but reasonable . The service was very good as well as the meat the salad bar was just okay , but I went there for the meat . My wife enjoyed the tres leches cake while I filled up on meat and pineapple . 

One suggestion is make a reservation before going and check their website for deals ."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. The meat was extremely bland and not very good. Service was horribly slow
 Had to wait 15 min for our check, and the meat guys took forever. Only desirable thing was the grilled pineapple and sirloin. The building is beautiful, The salad bar was nice, but otherwise, it really was just not good. Will definitely not be back and I don't recommend it to anyone. I hate spending alot of money on a meal that sucks."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful. I highly recommend the pineapple as well as the lamb. The weight staff was great however the buffet part of dinner was a little unsanitary (as buffets always are)"}
{"text":"Meat.  Meat.  Meat.

If you do not LOVE meat, then this is just a waste.  Seriously.  You have to LOVE meat.  I have been to Brazilian grills before but this was my first time at Samba.  I was upset that before I got there I paid for parking.  I was given no indication that Samba had its own parking lot.  While walking by, I saw a small sign, no bigger than a Stop sign.  

I was really excited for my dinner!  It was restaurant week in Madison and I wanted to try some place new.  My party of four made a reservation and were seated a few minutes early.  We waited nearly ten minutes for our server Antonio.  I was  not thrilled with his service.  He was ok, kind of attentive, but we had to wait for refills of drinks and clean plates.  Antonio was always a few minutes behind.  

Now the food...wow.  My favorite was the top sirloin.  Cooked nicely.  If you can not handle any pink in your steak, skip this and move on to the flank steak.  The pork was amazing.  They look like small pieces on the skewer but they are large pieces. 

You start your meal out by heading to the salad bar and hot item bar.  The mashed potatoes are great as are the vegetable assortment.  A key thing to remember is to eat this with your meal, not prior.  The salad bar was great but you are there for meat.  You can get a good salad anywhere.  There are some interesting items like heart of palm to try, but really eat the meat.  

There are nice little breads with cheese that compliment your meal.  Once again, remember you are there for the meat.  Meat. Meat. Meat.  The gauchos are fantastic.  Whatever you want, two pieces?  A small piece?  They provide this for you.

So I completely bad mouthed the pineapple.  Who would want pineapple at a Brazilian grill?  Me.  That is who.  My husband tried it first and it was amazing.  So the whole table was sold on this.  Yum.  That is all.  Yum, yum, yum.  

This is not a date place, but great for a large group"}
{"text":"Service was superb! They brought these insanely good (and salty) mini parmesan \"bagels\" to our table that was like a soft pillow that melts in your mouth! The servers that came around offering the meats were generous, giving us extra slices upon our request when we were brave enough to ask during the later half of our dining. They served eight types of meats: beef tenderloin, ribeye, top sirloin, flank steak, pork tenderloin, linguica (spicy pork sausage), chicken breast and leg of lamb. They also served grilled pineapple dusted with cinnamon and sugar, which is heavenly deliciously after consuming protein in excess, haha!

The salad bar has a good variety of decently healthy foods (mainly carbs), from roasted almonds, cubes of different varieties of Wisconsin cheese (a bit too dry), fresh and moist broccoli and cauliflower and green beans, mixed beans and corn salad, dinner rolls with whipped butter or whipped peanut butter with garlic or goat cheese, romaine lettuce or spinach salad, pesto rotini with sun-dried tomato, fresh mash potatoes spiced with herbs, to curry chicken, lentil soup and beef stew.

Servers bee-lined their way around the dining floor frequently, checking up on our needs such as water refills and making sure, per our host Lucas, \"we were still going strong\" for our next round of grilled meats, LOL.

Wished they had a dessert bar to accompany the salad bar because eating at only the salad bar is an option, though not a worthwhile option."}
{"text":"We went here for our Easter Brunch with our family this year.  We planned ahead and booked reservations expecting it to be very busy.  It was so we were happy we thought ahead there.  We showed up on time and we're seated immediately.  They got the whole table drinks very fast and then proceeded to tell us the specials.  They explained the process of how it works at thier resturant for those of us who had never been thier before.  Then they turned us loose.  
So we all started with thier salad bar so to speak.   This place has a unique style or play on a traditional buffet salad bar.  Fresh everything.  Homemade butters and bread, Brazilian nuts, olives, cheeses, fresh cut fruit, artichoke hearts, heart of palms, salads, tomatoes, and on and on and on.  Today's added special was pancakes, bacon, and potatoes.
Then on to the main event.  The kids flipped over the paddle to the green side and away we go.  The servers I believe they call them (goutchos), began to bring the goods.  Today they were serving honey glazed ham, parmasean cheese crusted pork medallions, tip sirloin (the favorite for most of us) , flanks steak, lamb, sausage links, and a cinnamon glazed pineapple.  Wow was this amazing.  Everyone was so impressed that they all want to go again next time they are in town.  The food was mouth watering....  You will think about the flavors from this place for a week after eating it. 
Let me tell you this place is a huge resturant.  It is very clean.  The servers and staff are all friendly and willing to go the extra mile for thier customers.  All of the employees were smiling and happy to assist.  Never a wait for food, constantly coming around.  Very cool atmosphere for kids to stay entertained.  Just all in all a wonderful place in the Madison market of exceptional resturant.  This is a must stop for someone who has never been here.  We will continue to come back this place is on point. 

Great job to SAMBA management and thier staff!"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting in celebration of my wife's birthday. Had no idea of what to expect but my daughter and son- in-law had been there before and suggested it.  We arrived about 6:00 and lucked out with parking right in front. Did not realise the area on ground floor was not the restaurant we were headed for so I was really surprised by the actual upper level facility.
We were promptly seated and given our introduction by a very friendly server.  Started with a house special cocktail and found it to be adequate in size and exceptional in flavor- had to have a second one just to be sure.
Visited the salad bar the likes of which I have never seen elsewhere- fantastic selections.  Made sure I left some room for the meat at our servers recommendation. Turned our indicator to green and got ready. I would say within five minute we had the start of the meat selections. I appreciated the sampler size portions at the start.  This allowed me to try several before concentrating on my favourites.  Once I selected my favourites it was no problem to ask for larger portions at the next presentation- if you didn't want o wait for the rotation to get back to your favourites all you needed to do was ask and it would arrive.  Yes the pineapple is fantastic.  I think the four of us finished two all by our selves.
The cost was not extravagant for the ambience, food and service.
Definitely will want to revisit on subsequent visits to Madison.
Thank you for an enjoyable evening!

{"text":"This Place is Lots of Smoke and Mirrors. Schnazzy Decor/Ambience, Somewhat Friendly Service, Pretty Decent Salad Bar, Good Mojito Beverage to Lull you in... Then Comes the Meat on the Stick from the Fancy Gauchos! Pretty Bad Meat... I somewhat enjoyed 2 out of the 8 options. Much of the meat was too chewy, iron/blood flavored. The 2 options I enjoyed were the parmesan pork and the beef sirloin (only when sliced reallllly thin) The Pineapple was good. At $42 / plate plus tip for a buffet style meal, I saw this as an easy One Star decision for overall value. I'd much rather go to Johnny Delmonico's or the like and spend $42 on a wonderful steak dinner that isn't sheared off of a stick in front of my face by Gauchos. Or I'll go to Knoche's butcher shop and buy a high quality chunk of meat for $6 - $15 / lb and grill it to my liking on my Weber. Today was my First and Last Visit to Samba. Not upset I went, now I know, and I now that I know, I know I will never go back nor recommend this place to anyone. Steer Clear! You Can Do Much Better! On to the next..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate a new career change and this was the perfect dinner for the occasion.  We picked this place on recommendation from coworkers and used the Group-on which gives about 25 dollars off. Oh man! My coworkers were right. This is the perfect atmosphere for a date night. The salad bar has so much more than just salad. Lots of options for sides. Don't get me started on the meat. It was so tender and flavorful, we tried everything. The grilled pineapple with a touch of cinnamon was just heavenly. Thank you Samba for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Having been to Samba a number of times since discovering it only a month or so ago, I can say it is one of my favorite places to eat in all of Madison if you are in a mood for unlimited food! Over time [as of 2014 now] the quality seems to have gone down in the food but the overall atmosphere and service is great.

The beginning salad bar is fantastic, you have to try the potatoes to start.  After the salad bar you are served all the meat you can eat, which in my opinion more than makes up for the price.  I honestly think that everyone should give Samba a try if they are in Madison at anytime just for the grilled pineapple and tapioca rolls!  If you have a large appetite there is no reason why you haven't had Samba yet."}
{"text":"Come hungry. There is a lot of interesting Brazilian and South American food to try on the buffet that accompanies the grilled meats. If you're buffet-phobic, it's easy to stick with the grilled meats they bring around. That said, even though I'm generally not a buffet fan, there is a fun variety of foods to try and sauces to accompany the meat."}
{"text":"They have one weird policy. Until the all group of ppl arrive, they never seat you in a table. So, if your friend is late somehow, you cannot seat! What a ridiculous policy!"}
{"text":"This would be a 5 for me except the last time I was here for my company Christmas party we got very poor service. We could not get the servers to come by with more food and when we asked about it we got a very pissy manager. They closed out bar down early and we drink a lot. Really stupid move. I am willing to do it again but they did a poor job of talking care of 40 people."}
{"text":"Don't bother!!!! Came here at 4:55 for 5:00 opening, the restaurant was COMPLETELY empty and they turned us away because \"the whole place was reserved\" with reservations for the entire night??? There was no mention online or if you called, only a sign on the desk when you come in and we drove 45 mins to get there. It was also a Wednesday not a weekend. Terrible business model and they were even rude when they turned us away, no apologies no explanation, just \"no walk ins, next\" just go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Tried it with a groupon, the Brazilian grilled meat were very decent and delicious. the waiter keep bringing you more and more as the night goes. The salad bar and the rest of the help yourself dishes, soup are also alright. The atmosphere was quite pleasant. But I don't think the money that I ended up paying at the spot and the groupon were worth it though."}
{"text":"What can be bad about all you can eat meat?
Seriously, we enjoyed our visit. The food was flavorful and plentiful. We ate four different preparations of beef, two of chicken, two of pork, one of turkey, one of lamb, and one of sausage. They have a nice salad bar with upscale items beyond the typical iceberg lettuce. Such as artichoke hearts, olives, cheeses, pasta salads; if you can't find something you like here you might want to check your pulse. Side dishes can be found by the salad bar, ours included smashed garlic potatoes, rice, tortilla soup, and some other items that presently slip my memory.
We hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Not impressive.  Adequate service, but for the price the menu items lacked attention to detail. No guarana.  Feijoada is not very authentic.   Pao de queijo a bit heavy.  Meats were a little bland in flavor. Salad bar had good variety, though.  A little limited selection in the meats compared to other similar Brazilian steakhouses."}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable Thanksgiving dinner here.  The variety and quality of the meats were very good.  Varied, solid salad bar.  Fair price for the experience, much less than comparable places in Chicago.  Wine list was solid and reasonably priced.  Attractive room, and a talented singer/guitarist on stage.  If I went to school here, I choose this for parental visits.

Wife and I went late, and a lot of families -- and the Badger football team -- preceded us.  Thank you, gentlemen, for not eating all of the meat. 

People were dressed across a wild range.  Saw one table taking a doggie bag home.  What the?"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Madison! The meats are always cooked perfectly, and the salad bar has a great variety. The grilled pineapple is to die for! Try going for Sunday Brunch if you want to try the meat without the high prices."}
{"text":"We were so excited to come out here because who doesn't wanna have AYCE meat?

The salad bar and hot food station had good selections. My favorites were the garlic mashed potatoes, cold pesto pasta, clam chowder (very seafood-y though), and the tray of Wisconsin cheeses.

As soon as we turned our little wooden pillar green, three gauchos came up with two kinds of sirloin and parmesan pork. Feeling quite overwhelmed very quickly, we turned it back to red. So as soon as we were ready for for meat....back to green....and the waiting game started.

Suddenly we couldn't get anyone to get to our table! So we took another trip to the salad bar/hot foods to kill some time and a gaucho finally arrived.

With grilled pineapple coated in cinnamon.

Ok, it wasn't meat but it was still good. BUT WHERE'S THE MEAT?!

Thankfully, one of the gauchos acknowledged us and made sure we got a piece of every meat they offered.

My favorite were the sirloins; the mango bbq chicken was ok; not a lamb person so didn't try that.

Not a terrible place, but not somewhere we'd go to on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I like a number of things about this place. First of all, the salad bar has some unusual items you normally don't see at salad bars (spiced almonds, sweet potato salad, a garlic hummus, etc). But more importantly, the meats are done well. It's not just flank steak, it's flank steak marinated in balsamic and honey; it's not just chicken, it's mango barbecue chicken. You get the idea. Also, you don't need dessert after a few slices of grilled pineapple with honey and cinnamon."}
{"text":"On Saturday, July 8th, my fiancée and I went to Samba with reservations for 830p. We were seated promptly, but it went downhill from there. The first stop was the salad bar. The cold items were good, but the \"hot\" items were room temperature at best. Then, the Rodizio meats. We got two rounds of 5 meat options within the first 15 minutes of our meal. After that, NO ONE came around. We were waiting for 20 minutes with our pillar turned to green, but no one came. Finally, one of the gauchos came by and simply said \"is there something more you want of anything?\" We had not even had all of the options of meat at that point, but were forced to tell them what we wanted instead of being offered (this was about 910p). The wait staff had proceeded to start cleaning up the dining room. We also noticed that the gauchos were packing up the meat. I was confused, as your website lists 10pm as a closing time. We proceeded to ask the man who seated us and he informed us that you seat tables up until 10p and usually serve until 1030p. He then told us that \"it gets slow later at night on Saturdays, so we usually pack up early.\" At that time, he walked away. He and other staff proceeded to take Tupperware containers to the salad bar for their own meals and proceed to grab meat of the skewers that they were supposed to be offering to customers. My fiancée and I had to wait at our table, with cold \"hot bar\" food. Finally a gaucho came by with chicken (a meat we had not seen until that time) and offered it; around 940p. We paid $100 for this meal and were treated worse than service at an Applebees or other casual dining. I will not be returning to your establishment."}
{"text":"The food here is usually fantastic! I've lost count of how many times we've been here since 2009 but we've enjoyed the food each time (especially desserts! On the rare occasions we saved Room for some). But the service is very spotty. The older lady who sometimes greets guests at the front desk is always in a terrible mood! Lol. She refuses to smile and was straight up angry with us the few times we showed up with no reservation. When we asked about how empty the restaurant was she stopped and glared at me for a solid 5 seconds before answering through gritted teeth \"we have guests on the way\". How dare I question her? Lol. 

Some of the wait staff are also super new and just are all over the place. Like if you ask them for a cup for a small child, something with a lid, they might come back to ask you random questions 4 times before bringing you a to-go styrofoam container used for soups. Hahaha. Just a simple \"sorry, we don't have anything\" would have been preferable. We were so confused why the request was so confusing. We ask for it at pretty much every restaurant. 

Just based on the food I would give samba 5 stars, but the service takes away two stars for sure."}
{"text":"We went there for brunch yesterday to scope out the food & venue for a large group in the spring. I have never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse before, as I am not a huge meat fan. However, I have to say that I am VERY particular on my Salad Bars and this is one of the best salad bars that I have been to in a long time. The vegetables are fresh there are so many options! I didn't even need to use lettuce because there was everything from my absolute favorite - Hearts of Palm to Green Beans. Everything needed to make an incredible chunky salad.

I didn't eat the \"brunch foods\" ... eggs, potatoes, bacon. However, it looked good. 

The Meats ... as I said I'm not a huge meat fan. However, I LOVED the Ham (which is only available during brunch) and the Beef was pretty awesome too. Not to mention the Grilled Pineapple ... yum! I read other reviews about waiting times for meats, we didn't experience any wait and it was fairly busy. I love that you get to control when you want meat delivered, I also didn't think the portions were small. I thought that they were perfect and we saw all of the meats come by a couple of times since our group was on slightly different eating patterns. 

Pastries were good, pumpkin cake with caramel frosting  - I think that is what it was. Loved the cake, the frosting wasn't my thing. I think my sweet pallet was ruined by the wonderful pineapple. So perfect! 

The space itself is decorated very nicely, was a comfortable fun spot for a Family Brunch and I am looking forward to going back in a couple of months."}
{"text":"I just don't feel the Samba vibe.  I have eaten here twice, and both times I had about a table spoon of filet.  They like to push you on pork, chicken, sausage, sirloin, etc...  If I want to eat horrible cuts of meat I can go to the store and buy the on sale crap.  When I go out I'm expecting top quality meat.

Perhaps they need to raise prices?  I don't have the answer... but never serving good stuff is why I don't think I will go back to this place.

Other items are decent... skirt steak, leg of lamb.  However the meat is not very tender (choice quality?) it is seasoned very well, and this makes it at least flavorful.

I found the drinks very nice but somewhat pricey.

I've eaten at Brazillian style grills many times, and of the four I've tried this is perhaps the lowest on the list for reasons above.  

I can think of one in Texas that at these same prices was far superior."}
{"text":"Meat toting gauchos! Seriously, If you have not experienced Gauchos bringing you meat on a spit, you have not yet lived as a carnivore! Service has always been great when we've been there, and the food is delish!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better BBBQ I've been too!  Still can't beat the ones in LA though.  The top sirloin and new york steaks are my favorites and the flank steak, chicken, pork, and others are ok.  I never tried the cinnamon pineapple before but I am a fan of it now.

Went on a sunday night and the place was pretty empty.  Service was fine and attentive.  Food at the buffet portion was pretty fresh.  Don't forget the Wisconsin Cheese!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Week in Madison a great success again! 
I obviously went to Samba for their $25 special which included full gaucho service with the salad & appetizer bar. It was excellent.

Our service started a little rough, and after sitting at our table waiting for someone to come around to us, I had to ask a server walking by to send a waiter our way. 
After we got the ball rolling with that...it was straight up go time! Food, meat, and more meat!
I loved all the meat, but my favorite was the pineapple. It was glazed in Cinnamon and warmed. Fantastic. 
Kind of a funny story about the pineapple....everyone at my table was like, pineapple--- I'll pass! But I took full advantage of it and tried a piece. After I let it slip how great it was, everyone at the table asked for some. A perfect desert (without buying desert)! 

Not sure if I could afford to try this place on a random day of the week. This is a special kind of occasion type of restaurant. 
I would only take a date here if you know that you both have large appetites and your OK with that.
Overall, a solid 4. It was a fun night with Samba."}
{"text":"The food at Samba is excellent in every regard.  

You start your meal at their 40 item salad bar, which is delicious.  It has traditional salad toppings, a variety of pasta salads, interesting vegetables, spanish cheeses, and more.

The meat is the best part though.  They have nine different cuts on any given night, and the cooks come around and slice you off some of whichever meat they are passing around.  The top sirloin was a perfect medium rare and probably their best meat.  The duck was delicious, the flank steak had amazing seasonings on it, and the bacon wrapped tenderloin tasted great.  The rack of lamb had a little too much garlic, but other than that was pretty good and both the leg of lamb and the parmesan pork were delicious.  The sausage they offered was tasty, but did not set itself apart as spectacular.

They have a decent beer selection and the restraunt overall has a wonderfull ambience.  The food is what makes this place special though."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week and it was absolutely delicious. I've been to Samba about 4 times now and I've never been disappointed. From beginning to end their staff was attentive and professional towards all of their customers. In the past I've never been a fan of the Parmesan pork but I was happy to find that they've improved the dish!! It's still a tad salty but it has a great Parmesan flavor which it was lacking the last time I was here. But ofcourse, the clear favorite is the pineapple. Never skimp out when the pineapple comes around!"}
{"text":"There's something about gauchos that really takes it up a notch.  The converted Women's Building is now a theme restaurant to the max.  It's decadent and lavish and over-the-top in an awesome Vegas kind of way. The salads were terrific, the service was unbeatable in Madison, and the meat was everywhere.  Quite literally.  Meat rules so it was a success!"}
{"text":"We went to Samba during restaurant week.  The normal price of a meal is $39.95 and it was advertised at $35 for restaurant week.  However, when we got our bill it was $30 which pleased us -- and for good reason.

Turns out for restaurant week, Samba limits their available meats from the usual 9 to 6.  This initially was a turn off but 6 was probably sufficient.  They were:

- Garlic Roasted Chicken Legs (not Mango BBQ Chicken as stated on the website)
- Parmesan Pork
- Linguica (pork sausage)
- Leg of Lamb
- Flank Steak
- Picanha

The website also said garlic bread which wasn't served (no big deal) and of course they served the cinnamon dusted pineapple.

Also of note, the little rolls were no longer served on the table, you had to get your own at the salad buffet.  I don't know if that was done just for restaurant week or if that is the way they are handling the rolls now.

Last night the meat was fantastic!  However that has not always been the case as we have experienced dry pork and overcooked steak.  The pork was tender and the beef was savory though a bit salty sometimes.  The upscale salad bar was spot on as usual.  Hot sides served last night were the beef stew, rice, garlic mashed potatoes and a tomato cream soup.  They have had a black bean side in the past which I get, but I didn't miss it terribly last night.

Four stars simply because we feel at nearly $40 per person it's not worth it outside of restaurant week.  Even $30 can feel a bit high and if they had a menu with standard entrees we might find ourselves ordering from that menu versus the all you can eat experience.

If you like meat, definitely try it out once, it a fun experience as a group!"}
{"text":"I agree with most of the other reviewers on the food.  The meat is great and the 'salad bar' is WAY higher-end and more diverse than any salad bar I've even seen.  

The space itself is really cool.  Its run well.  The gauchos can get overwhelmed on busy nights but are usually attentive.

The meat is tasty and abundant but the best part is the wine list - cheap and wide-ranging."}
{"text":"I was there for dinner one night and found myself in love with the style. It is really cool. The staffs are soooo nice. They explain to you how to ask for the meat you want and how to eat there."}
{"text":"As long as you're ready to drop some change, you're going to LOVE Samba. 

We decided to do brunch here, because it's almost half price, and after checking out the website, I thought it was almost the full experience, anyhow(just not as many meat choices).

The minute we walked in, I was totally in love with the interior. A little dark, with rich colors and nice design...and PLENTY of seating. We were immediately seated, and our waitress came over soon after. Although the drinks looked tasty(I would imagine that a place like this would do kick butt mojitos, and the mimosa selection was fun), I decided to just get coffee. Our waitress explained how the experience worked, and left us a basket of Po De Queijo, which is almost like a cheesy popover, with bits of spicy peppers...YUM. 

We started off at the salad bar, which is much more than just salad. For brunch, they had Yukon gold potatoes, and a variety of grilled, steamed, and marinated veggies. There was also a variety of fresh fruit, and a parfait bar with yogurt and oats. If this isn't enough, you can also grab some delicious Spanish cheese and roasted nuts to top your plate off. I can see why they offer a salad bar only option at night, you could easily make a nice meal out of just that!

BUT, we were going full out...so bring on the meat! After we finished our first course, we flipped our \"pillar of meat\", and soon after the Gaucho brought us our first selection, which was a spicy sausage. We also tried the flank steak(delicious, although I wish my cut had come from further in the slab, because I like it a bit more rare), and the leg of lamb was AMAZING. There was also a country ham, which we didn't try. Another favorite of ours was the cinnamon-sugar crusted pineapple that they grilled. So good. 

My only complaint was that I had been looking forward to the jazz music they advertised, but the band came in to set up just as we were finishing our plates.

We were seriously stuffed...and I had to laugh when the waitress came to apologize that she had not told us that they offer fresh waffles(blueberry, plain and chocolate, I believe). I also overheard her telling another table that they make scrambled eggs, too. It didn't matter, because there was NO way we were going to be able to eat anything else.

All in all, Samba has a great atmosphere, delicious food, and attentive staff(even if the waitress DID forget to offer us a few items). I think that it was well worth the $20 a plate price. Is it somewhere I'll go every Sunday? No, but I'll definitely be back!

*I'd also like to try the Cabana Room downstairs, which is their \"everyday\" restaurant. It had a nice outdoor patio, and the menu looks good."}
{"text":"We had reservations for Valentine's Day. I know it is cliché but we celebrate Valentine's once every 4 or 5 years.  Since it was a Saturday and my husband works nights all week, we typically eat like 2 ships passing in the night. Friends suggested Samba.  They aren't right in their suggestion.

We arrived at 5:50 for a 6pm reservation.  Another couple arrived behind us, a second behind them.  They were both seated ahead of us.  Now maybe their reservation was for earlier, but that means they were late.  No one makes a reservation for 5:55pm. they were seated in the main dining room. They called my husband and I, we were taken to our table. It was in a back room, in a corner, against a wall.  The temperature in the room was very chilly and the room itself had a very \"cold\" feeling to it.  I asked to be switched to another table, this was unsatisfactory.  Ok, they moved us.  To a smaller table, right next to the doorway... we were told they were completely booked solid and that was the only other option.  Fine, whatever, at least we were now in the actual dining room.  

We were told to help ourselves to the salad bar, they explained the red and green paddle, which we already knew having been to other Brazilian steakhouses. We go the salad bar. There in the center of the dining room were 4 4 top tables, set up for 2 people.  Ok, mental note.  We help ourselves and the salad bar is truly less than impressive.  The cheese bread was stone cold, the beets were not good. It was very small. Again, ok, you really aren't going there for the salad bar.  So easy to overlook that if the meat is good.

The meat was fair.  The gaucho with the pineapple stopped at our table at least 5 times.  Garlic bread once, we actually had to ask our waiter to find him.  Turkey wrapped in bacon, we never saw that.  Sausage, we were all set to call it a night when he showed up.  Flank steak, most of the meat was gone and we were offered barely the tip, smaller than the tenderloin and it was well done. My husband enjoyed the mango chicken, I thought it was ok, just could have been a lot warmer. The parmesan pork, licking sand in the Sahara would be more moist.  The whole experience gets a \"meh\".  I won't go back.

Here's where it gets fun... when the waiter handed us our check... Those 4 4top tables set for 2 that were in the center of the restaurant... They had only JUST been seated for the first time.  At the end of our meal, they sat empty for our entire visit there.  So much for completely sold out and no possible room to put us elsewhere.  Don't BS a BS'er... I do plan on calling management tonight and voicing my displeasure, although I am certain it will fall on deaf ears.

Oh the survey question \"Has TV\"... They say no on their website. But get that chilly, cold back room that looks like an after thought and you can have a 50\" television hanging over your head.  Private lot parking... We did get the one and only open spot in the parking lot.  Ok, it is small, we were in the middle of downtown Madison, parking is a premium.  I always make mental note of vehicles around me... Same exact cars still there when we left.  Obviously the \"customer only\" parking should say \"Lucky customer, employees will grab all the spots first\" parking."}
{"text":"It's a Brazilian Grill in Madison. That's all you need to know really. The salad bar is very good, but don't fill up on cheese and almonds, as tempting as it is. The meat is all very delicious (chicken, pork, sausage, two kinds of steak, lamb), but the lamb isn't my cup of tea, but other people at our table liked it. I also really like the grilled pineapple.

It's spendy, but worth it."}
{"text":"Was always intrigued by their \"concept\" of meats coming on skewers and sliced right on your plate. And this past weekend, as part of Restaurant Week, got a chance to try them out in person. Was it worth it...No

Decor : A little to dim and red for my taste. From a far it looks fine, but get closer and you notice the slight grime on tables, the even darker ambient furniture. Our chairs had nails sticking out on the edges so that was not nice! (They really outta check that coz that can injure someone)

Service : Pleasant had it been a normal ala carte restaurant but the concept here mars the it down a notch. Once you've tried all meats/veggie ensembles, you basically then \"wait\" until that particular favorite one comes by to you, which mostly doesn't as it would just get devoured by tables before you. And then you keep waiting more....

Food : I'd give the crazy wait a pass had the food been worth the wait. Alas it wasn't. The steak variety was chewy, overly rare and devoid of any seasoning. The pork was better as it came grilled/roasted with Parmesan cheese so the moisture from the cheese helped balance the dryness of the tenderloin. The sausage was average at best and can be associated with one you get from Walmart, laden with salt. The chicken legs were weirdly tiny to make you feel they may have come from ones that were malnutrition-ed!! The lamb was a best \"MEAT\" of the worst. It too lacked seasoning and was cooked a tad dry. But the char on the outside skin gave it the a much needed boost of flavor.

Long story short - Meat varieties tragically disappointing with over cooking and gross lack of seasoning/flavors.

Now the reason why this place got 2 stars instead of 1. The absolutely and sinfully sumptuous Grilled Cinnamon Pineapple!!! Take it from me, I'm not a pineapple guy and but man o man was that  good or what!! We must've had 3 courses of it and had to wait easily 10 mins between each (The hungry parties before our table gobbled them all up before it could come to us!!) but worth it.

The so called \"Unlimited Buffet\" section has a few hits (brazilian nuts, goat cheese) but overall doesn't help bring up the atmosphere of average cooked meats going around.

Despite being Restaurant Week, it came to be $30 pp before drinks, tip and taxes. Nopes, not worth that money. I'd spend that kind anyday on better dining delights in Madison :)"}
{"text":"There is nothing bad about Samba Brazilian Grill except for the price, which I honestly can't complain about considering its the best all-you-can-eat meat buffet I've ever had in my life.

The wine is delicious and the food is even better. Never have I been so tortured and delighted by the meat sweats."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am extremely disappointed by this place. Came here on a Monday evening with my SO for our 4 year anniversary. There is a parking lot outside, but it was full so we parked across the street. We had waited a few minutes to be seated but that was fine (we had reservations but they didn't seem to be necessary). After we were seated, we again, waited a few minutes. We had been to all-you-can-eat Brazilian steakhouses before, but this one was new to us. The concept is you have a marker indicating whether you would like to continue to be served (\"green side\") or you would like to be left alone to eat or you're finished (green side). We were told there were nine items on the grill. 

We began perusing the salad bar, which, while interesting and necessary next to the meats. It was a little lacking in options though for the picky eater. Again, I must compare it to the other Brazilian places similar to this I've been to before, and those offered a wider variety of items. Among offerings there were several different types of salads offered, from fresh greens to seafood salad. In addition, there were items such as soup of the day, rice, cheesy potatoes, and stews. The cheese selection, while small (3 types of cheeses), was pretty tasty. 

Overall, the service itself was extremely slow. Maybe it was because it was a weekday night, but we found ourselves waiting about 5 minutes or more between each meat we saw. Overall, the meats were alright, the top sirloin being our favorite. Other items include: chicken legs, cinnamon-apple lamb, linguica (pork sausage), bacon wrapped turkey, flank steak, a tenderloin, grilled cinnamon pineapple, and a few other items I can't recall. The top sirloin itself was delicious, but several of the others fell flat, including some very dry/overcooked pieces of meat. The bacon wrapped turkey was also good, though not the type of food I would come to a place like this for. 

In addition, when we were almost finished with our meal, we finally received cheesy bread rolls. Although they were decent, they just fell a little flat and were just a little disappointing. The grilled pineapple was juicy and a good finish though (you have to catch the servers walking around with that, so time it right!). 

In the end, we were disappointed with the overall meal and were full just from waiting so long in between. We ended up not getting a dessert, as it was just time to leave. It wasn't a special place to go for a four year anniversary, but maybe it was an off night. If you haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, this might be worth the experience, but for the price and for our occasion, I wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"The best Brazilian restaurant I've been to in Madison or anywhere else in the country, excellent selection of side dishes and meat that is exceptional. If you like all you can eat, juicy meat, sausages, and chicken, this is the place. And don't pass on the roasted pineapple, it will give you a while new appreciation for the fruit."}
{"text":"Pros:
1.  GRILLED PINEAPPLE. Oh my goooood.
2. Salad bar. I liked not having to wait for my food.
3. Cute \"gaucho\" guys!

Cons:
1. Lighting. Why is it so dark? Am I supposed to feel like I'm in a cave? Is that a Brazilian..thing...?
2. Price. Unless you're going to eat POUNDS of meat and salad, it's really not worth $37 per person.

Overall, not bad, but not super-crazy-awesome. Probably wouldn't go there again unless I was invited by a group, like I was for this visit. Or if I had a major grilled pineapple craving and $37 to spend."}
{"text":"Everything was off a little. Slow service, food was just okay and I didn't think they're meat preparation was up to par. Nice building and cool location, but sorry, need to up the service before I could recommend."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see that Samba is open on Sundays for brunch. While it is a leaner menu for your inner carnivore (3 meat selections plus roasted pineapple), they continue to have their cold foods bar which also includes pastries for brunch. The $15 price point is very reasonable given the food and service. If going later in the morning, remember to make a reservation or you will be waiting for your table.

One last tip: the flank steak is their premier selection, be sure to try it."}
{"text":"I hated this place.  I would have given it 1 star but I did like about half of the salad bar.  Now let me begin by saying I am not a huge fan of meat in general but opted to go with friends.  Not being a big fan of meat, when I do eat it I like it cooked not dripping with blood.   I had to ask everytime for cooked meat when they were walking around and even then it was never actually cooked.  I wasn't a fan and I feel it was really overpriced for the quality of service and food."}
{"text":"Okay. This review is compared to other restaurants in Madison, not other Brazilian Steakhouses/Grills. Also---this is a review of their Brunch. 

I was willing to give this place a chance despite the reviews. I always try a place once unless multiple people got sick from their experience. 

They have their own parking lot! There were plenty of spaces at 11am on Sunday. Unfortunately, after 11am the parking situation is not ideal. Good luck finding street parking too. You can make reservations online, which is convenient. This is a large space. Seating is available to the left and right and upstairs.

Selection. So they have a flank steak, ham, sausage and cinnamon pineapple (everyone's favorite). I would definitely suggest that you get the ham and pineapple together (if you do eat meat). The pineapple is great alone too. There is a lot to choose from the \"buffet' section. They always have scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes. It seems like there is also always popcorn shrimp. One time I went they had waffles and another time they had chicken empanadas. I'm guessing that they change up one of their selections each week. There's salad (variety of greens and other veggies), fruits, yogurt, and desserts. 

Drinks. Mimosa all the way. It was so strong and delicious. It made the meal more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend getting a mimosa with brunch. Do it!

Service. Decent. I would say that they do a great job on refilling waters and taking plates away. If you are taking new people there, they will provide a thorough explanation of how everything works. 

Overall, the brunch experience is great and affordable (more affordable than the dinner). I haven't tried the dinner yet and will update the review once I try it out. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Samba is a very nice place. I admit it, even though they have a salad bar.

Normally I'd pan anyplace that had a salad bar. Typically they are disgusting and remind me of the Old Country Buffet. You can just see them crawling with bacteria as customers with unwashed hands dollop portions of mayonnaise-bound salads of increasingly dangerous temperatures onto their overloaded plates and go groaning back to their sticky, rickety tables to stuff their faces.

Urgh.

But Samba for some reason doesn't do this to me. It's weird and I can't explain it, but the salad bar is actually...appetizing. Pretty, even. It looks like a vegetarian designed it for their wedding. It's dimly lit. It's almost like candlelight. It's all dark wood and burnished silver. 

There are marinated artichoke hearts and grilled asparagus there. There are selections of several types of goat cheese displayed on a mirrored tray. We're talking stuffed mushroom caps with pine nuts and elegantly sculptured little radishes. 

There are piping hot slabs of fried eggplant right out of the pan. Hello!

If I were actually a vegetarian I would be totally cool going to Samba with my carnivorous friends given such an excellent selection of greens. Since I'm not actually a vegetarian, I go there and eat slabs of meat too after my little salady-appetizer. 

They make their employees dress a little bit doofy, but apart from that I have no complaints of any kind. woot for Samba"}
{"text":"I will not come back here again. Definitely did not have a good time here. The waiter was not attentive as you would expect at a restaurant of this caliber. The meats were good but they were nothing special really. Compared to other Brazilian steakhouses, I can safely say this was the worser one. Their one redeeming quality is the grilled cinnamon pineapple. I definitely had at least 5 pieces of that.  The food comes at extremely slow paces and they did not give us our cheesy bread until 3/4 into the meal.

Again just to reiterate, food is woefully average, service is poor, and overall just a bad experience. Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"A solidly OK dining option in downtown Madison.  It was much better in terms of service and quality when they first opened. I'd also make sure you were not seated next to a table of sixteen. 

Every time the gauchos got anywhere near our table they we waylaid by larger table and picked clean - so was very hard for us to get a full service experience. We had to ask multiple times for some of the meat choices. 

I'd also say the bar is over priced and the drinks poorly executed given the price points. Over $30 for three poorly executed mixed drinks was a bit much. 

All of this said we were there on thanksgiving - I'm happy we found a place that was open and serving later than 4PM."}
{"text":"Very good option for an upscale, unique experience in downtown Madison. Not on par with Fogo de Chao. But not because of food quality. We had the Sunday buffet and the selection was plentiful and delicious. Ambience is generally pleasant. 

I was there with my parents who are in their 70s. The music was extremely loud to the point we could hardly converse then suddenly there was no music.

Service was not good for prices this high(more on this is in a minute). The wait staff and bus people seemed clueless. They forgot a drink order, didn't fill water glasses until flagged down, didn't replace silverware until asked and had an air of attitude.

I didn't mind paying $30 a head but felt it was a little steep. The sticker shock came when they included a 20% gratuity for a table of six, FOR A BUFFET! Then they had the audacity to leave an additional line for an even higher tip(which can easily be missed). 

These problems are obviously fixable. Need a seasoned restaurant manager to put more training in place for the staff and get rid of that excessive required gratuity and voila!"}
{"text":"I wonder about their long term viability because they have such a large venue andit is often mostly empty. Based on food and service, the place ought to be full most of the time."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. I was skeptical at first about the type of service we would receive because we were seated upstairs in a corner but the gauchos came around every time we flipped our indicator to green. The meat was absolutely delicious and not overlooked as others had suggested and we got to try all 8 different kinds including the grilled pineapple. We loved it so much that we had 3 servings of them all. The salad bar was full and the chicken curry was absolutely amazing. Service was good to and we got our drinks within minutes. Overall, this place has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Happy to report that my family liked the place. 

Now for my review: 
I make it my business to visit every possible Brazilian Steakhouse (Chima, Fago de Chao, Texas de Brazil, and even the local ones like in Charlotte & Cali). Well, you know how some guys want to visit every Hall of Fame or Arena Mecca (e.g. think  Lambeau then Cleveland for the Hall of Fame and I'm dying to get to NASCAR Hall of Fame) but anywhoo....

My ode to Samba: 

How I loved thee from the beginning. When I searched for people to go with me and to no avail so I made family reservations. Then, I loved your locally owned process & ability to rework an old building keeping the historic flavor in tact. Thereafter, I finally made it to brunch. At the time your OJ was captivating but your waffles were underappreciated. 

Yet, when the OJ disappeared I took NOTICE then the waffles flew the coop so I chose not to be bothered knowing I'd be able to fit my BODICE. When the service WAVERED I gladly stood in your defense that the Packers are on the screen so the place is maintaining some FLAVOR. Since I started this ode YESTERDAY and have since walked AWAY; I can't remember what I wanted to CONVEY but this is what I will SAY. 
Please bring the WAFFLES BACK as that rowdy couple won't be back since y'all gave them the SACK
But I don't blame them as those waffles were GREAT - no syrup needed but hey that's the general consensus not just my TAKE. 
Nonetheless, dining at the dinner HOUR can fall flat when the server is overly pompous coming across as  SOUR. He was shocked to learn that dinner wasn't GREAT for my Valentine's DATE. But as the gentleman explained; we've been to TdB and the service was fiercely MEAN as in things were rolling hard, fast and smooth like a well oiled MACHINE. 

I take this time to serenade you through POEM hoping when one of your owners finish his time served - he'll flip a COIN and say:  \"Give that Joyce and the MASSES the waffles that they have been craving because we're no FACISTS!\"  I love the décor, the color SCHEME as it all speaks to ME. I love the live PERFORMANCES even when there were only so so MUSICIANS. 
I've never sat upstairs but expect it to be SWANK; I have sat in the bar, closest to the buffet area and nothing felt depressing and DANK. I appreciate you all taking a chance to bring the Brazilian style dining flair to a smaller market as I know running a business can be HARD but even catering to the vegetarians is SMART. 

I'm sure you're a Madison favorite, dare I SAY, so stick to the recipe so your journey will be successful, long running justifying you all to STAY.

P.S. Your receipt may have a discount to Café Samba below."}
{"text":"I attended an event here and was not really happy with the experience. 

When I heard we were going to a Brazilian place all I could envision was Fogo de Chao.  This place was not that. 

When we arrived all of the tables were taken and there were like 100 people waiting in line for food.  Not a good sign for hungry people. We decided to hunt for a place to sit.  We ended up on the top floor with a group of friends.  The company was great but we all did not want to wait in that long line.  So we camped out drinking wine and beer (no line at The bar)!!!

Samba had a table up here with cheese, olives and nuts.  I hate to say that this might have been the best thing here. 

After an hour we finally got in the food line and it still took 20 minutes.  We then realized that the people in front of us were on there second round of food.  So annoying because there were so many people who had not eaten yet.  The restaurant should have had a system in place to handle 350 people but it didn't. Maybe this was there first event here. They need some organization, if they ever do something like this again. 

Once we got to the front to start getting our food the plates ran out. Nobody was there to help us or get more plates.  In fact, I got out of line went up towards the salad bar and grabbed a giant stack for everyone.  I had to stock the plates. Really?

So with plate in hand there were three choices of meat...two red meat and one pork. The pork was dry but had potential. One red meat was full of fat and I couldn't even cut it with the knife provided. I would have told you what the meats were but when I asked they guy cutting it he didn't even seem to know.  That's not good!!

Salad bar items were okay. A few dishes were completely empty. Again no one from the staff was there keeping an eye on this. Empanadas were dry and lacking meat...it was more dough then anything.  Also the yummy Brazilian little cheese buns you find at other Brazilian restaurants were here.  The only difference these were just completely terrible. I had no idea they could taste that bad...usually I can't stop eating these but I didn't have that problem here. The best thing on the salad bar were the rice balls.  Wow these were really good...a nice Sicilian dish made perfectly at a Brazilian place. Very confusing to me but glad something besides the cheese and olives that was good. 

Bartenders were nice but I had to wait
Twice for a Spotted Cow (draft beer) while issues with the keg were sorted out. That was not fun. 

Now I have no idea how this place is when you actually order off the menu but as a banquet location it was completely terrible.  I blame the management for not being more organized and actually treating the large party with the respect of an individual table. They were probably at the bank cashing the check (allegedly)!!!

I would not want to attend an event here ever and probably would not want to come back as an individual.  I was completely let down with Samba!!!"}
{"text":"We came here after UW graduation to celebrate, again. 

Luckily, we made a reservation, because the place was obviously packed for graduation. The location here is neat because it looks like it used to be an old mansion of some sort. 

Once seated, the host quickly explained how the service works, took our drink order, and sent us on our way to the salad bar. Pretty much all the salads I tried were great, and much better than a similar salad bar would be at your local upscale grocery store. The mojito I ordered, was decent, but I've had better.

Once we flipped the 'i'm ready to eat meat switch', the gaucho's started descending on our tables with a ton of different cuts of beef, pork, and lamb. Most of it was pretty good, and there were only a few that I didn't personally prefer. 

Overall, I was satisfied with the food and experience that Samba gave us that evening. I'd highly recommend it if you have an occasion to celebrate, or if you simply just like a TON of meat!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was amazed!!! For a prix fix dinner, it's definitely worth the money. While it's an all-you-can-eat style meal, there a usually 6 or 7 different types of meats brought to you and a salad bar which serves copious amounts of vege's and cold salads. There is enough food to fulfill then needs of anyone, no matter how hungry they are, or aren't.

The mojitos are delicious, I'd highly recommend trying a few!!!

If you've never been to a Brazilian Grill I'd highly recommend it, as it is something that has to be experienced to fully appreciated."}
{"text":"It is very difficult for me to admit that a steakhouse is bad, but this one wins. We stayed for 2 hours and they only served 2 types of meat (90% of the time the same one). First of all GAS grill is an assassin of the \"brazilian barbecue\", that's why all tasted really bad. No papaya cream for desert is another indicator that this is not from Brazil . And to close , no espresso, definitely not from Brazil. You got the second start only because of the potato salad and the farofa which were very good. This is so brazilian as Panda Express is chinese."}
{"text":"Always good. Great salad bar and efficiency good service with nice quantity of different meats. 
It's only 4 stars and not 5 as compare with others ( not in Madison tho ) same style restaurants"}
{"text":"Refreshing to find a brunch with these types of quality selections. Bowls full of veggies, fresh greens, fresh chimichurri sauce, baked goat cheese, fresh baguettes and so much more. Yes, yes there are eggs and bacon also. Then comes my favorite part, servers offering endless slices of traditional Brazilian rotisserie treats! Marinated flank steak, Linguica sausage, succulent ham and, the to die for whole grilled pineapple.  Top it off with a mimosa and that makes a Sunday fun-day!

Great price, great atmosphere in a beautiful historic building!!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. We've been here a handful of times over the past couple of years and it's always been pretty decent, but after going today we won't be back. The food in the past has been very good for the most part, although the service has always been spotty, along with the quality of the meats and pineapple. It's totally hit or miss and there's no consistency whatsoever. 

I would be more okay with some of the food being better than others (I'm talking the same cut or sirloin being better one time around and much worse 20 minutes later) if it weren't for the fact that they seem to have significantly cut down on their selection, while simultaneously raising their prices (used to be $35, now is around $42 per person). The salad bar today was severely lacking and not at all up to par with what we've had in the past here. We were there for over an hour and were only offered three or four different meat selections, when in the past it was closer to ten. We still left full, but it just isn't the same. Samba was special because of its great selection, but now that it has lost that, we won't be back. Certainly not worth the price anymore."}
{"text":"We love this place you start with these little cheese filled rolls they bring to your table. Then it's off to the salad bar not a normal salad bar but Brazilian and Latin dishes don't  take too much the best is yet to come. On your table there is a wooden bowling pin like thing 1 end with a green stripe the other red turn it to green and let the fun begin. There are usually 10 varieties of grilled items different cuts of beef,chicken,pork ,lamb, duck and a delicious cinnamon  pineapple. When your pin is green side up they stop by your table and ask if you want the item they have if you do they cut you off a piece you grab it with your tongs. If you turn it to red the don't stop by. They are groupon quite a bit so you can save 25 bucks.   It's a meat lover dream my husband picks it for his Birthday most years."}
{"text":"Came to Samba on St. pattys day since it is also my dads birthday. The service was absolutely terrible. Most of the food was cold, since there wasn't a lot of customers they didn't seem to care. Water was always low and no one seemed to come by and ask if we needed anything. What makes it worse was the staff was all sitting and eating at the bar during this. Just because it's not busy doesn't mean you can snub off the customers that do come in. Also our group was big enough for auto-gratuity, adding to the \"don't care\" factor. As a waitress myself this is just annoying to see. On the plus side the meat was all amazing, but if we want sauce with it, you should bring it right away."}
{"text":"I loved eating here. it is a lot of food, for $36 per person. But it is a bit expensive for college students.

As someone that is half Brazilian, and has been to several Brazilian steak houses, this was a very similar experience with people walking around with the meat on the poles.

We had a variety of meats and the Bolo de Brigaderio for dessert. I love brigaderios, and this was really delicious 

My only problem was that they didn't have the famous Brazilian soda, Guarana, which is something that I always look forward to drinking when I visit Brazilian restaurants.

If they ever get Guarana, I will then give them a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before I'm sure you will love Samba. However, it's not as good as many of the other rodizio places I've experienced.

The salad bar is lackluster. Most places offer crazily stocked salad bars that could get me full for 3 days before ever touching the meat (shrimp cocktail, cured meats, you name it!).   I usually have to restrain myself. Here, nothing is all that enticing. The cheese balls that are my favorite thing ever at these types of places are often cold or run out.

The meat is fine but also not as good as at other similar restaurants. My favorite is definitely the prime rib. I wish there were more really good meats (lamb chops, more steaks, etc) and fewer items like buffalo chicken. That's not why I go to a Brazilian steakhouse. They do bring out the most delicious grilled pineapple ever.

Service is hit or miss. I would go back for an occasion because it's all we have in Madison, but I definitely recommend going to a Fogo or a Texas de Brazil for a higher quality experience."}
{"text":"I'll get the easy part out of the way. The food is excellent. The bounty available on the buffet astounded me both in variety and how good it was. The same goes for the rôtisserie meats offered, plus the carvers had great timing regarding the gap between coming to the table and the sequence of who brought what.

Now on to why I deducted two stars. I deduct one for layout of the establishment. You walk into what looks like the foyer of a former house, but there is no host stand in sight. (It turns out it is upstairs in front of the main dining room.) There is what looks like the bar/waiting room in a room straight ahead of that. It is a lounge that bears the Samba name but apparently functions separately from the restaurant. Indeed, other couples wandered in and asked the bartender about table availability, etc., only to be told to go upstairs. Another star is lost to further disorgainzation amongst the waitstaff when we got upstairs. There looked to be plenty of tables open, yet we were told to wait at the bar for about half an hour. The main problem appeared to be a lack of communication between the parts of the service staff, and that only continued when we finally sat. The carvers were timely, but the waitress responsible for our drinks, clearing plates, etc., was not very attentive. The right hand did not seem to know what the left hand was doing.

In sum, great food but confused service."}
{"text":"Had an excellent brunch, truly one of the best in Madison. Our server Emilio was friendly and attentive.  The food was great, especially the flank steak and the grilled pineapple."}
{"text":"From my first experience, I was super excited because this place is so different from what I usually do.  And meat.  Of course, I was excited for mass amounts of meat.  This may be the one place where it is ok to have an entire meal on just meat.

After a few visits, it kind of has lost it's appeal, but do not get me wrong,  This place still has its time and place.  First, it is rather expensive, even with the groupon (on a teacher's budget, most things can be considered expensive I guess...).  But the food is unlimited!  With that being said, I went through, had a salad, some bread, a curry salad and cheese prior to eating any meat.  I was full just from the first round...I stuffed myself with meat and was miserable for the rest of the night, by no means was it not worth it though.  The meat does taste good but most of the time, I just do not feel I eat my money's worth.  

The service.  The way this place works, you have stoneage mallot like things.  When you want meat, put the green side up.  They come and go when the green side is up.  They are usually pretty quick but because they are continually visiting tables, the servers seem like they just want to get you the meat and move on.  I did not feel a lot of energy or engagement.  

Long story short, I think there are other places to go when we want a fancy-ish dinner that has more personality.  It is worth to go once or twice for the experience but after that, find another option."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviewers in that this is a dining experience.  The interior is just fantastic, and usually there is a live band playing on weeknights.  The 40 item salad bar was scrumptious but honestly, the main attraction is the meat.  Vegetarians will be hard pressed to find a sustainable variety at the salad bar, so unless you're willing to go to \"the dark side\" for this meal, perhaps you should meet your friends out later.  As a mostly vegetarian, I ended up going to the dark side because I couldn't resist.  My favorite was the duck -- it was succulent and fantastic.  This place is definitely a wonderful experience and I'm sure the next time a special occasion arises we will consider going here."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Madison for meat sunday special was well worth it.  From the Goat Cheese to the many beefs (ex Flank steak), a real treat and bargain at $15 for Brazilian food. Service was outstanding and  restaurant is well decorated, its hard to believe its Madison."}
{"text":"Outrageously good. Great service even on a busy Fathers Day. Nicely displayed salad bar with quite a variety. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. The host, I believe his name was AJ, was completely out of line and extremely rude. His behavior in front of guests was insulting and honestly ruined the rest of my meal. I might as well add his ugly red turtle neck was almost as bad as his horrendous attitude and it did not fit with the rest of the staff's uniforms. I was a server when I was younger so I understand the business but you would have never caught me dead talking crap about the other servers, IN FRONT OF GUESTS, to the bartender while still on the clock. Heard him complaining the whole time. I shouldn't blame the host though, it all comes back to the management when you have employees that out of line."}
{"text":"I don't know whether it's the regular Groupon offers or what, but the quality of the meals at Samba has definitely declined.  Like what a few other posters have recently posted, the flavor of the steaks during a couple of recent visits were completely dominated by soy sauce and were WAY too salty.  In my view, steak should be lightly seasoned in order for one to savor the natural tastes of the meat and fat.  Service, with respect to keeping our water glasses full and delivering cocktails (the money maker), was excellent, but they seriously were lacking in people coming around with the meat.  They do tend to push the sausage and parmesan crusted pork, which actually was one of the better tasting offerings. 

Samba has definitely dropped several notches below Sabor in Milwaukee and down in the dumps compared to Fogo de Chao; however, given that two meals at Samba with the Groupon cost just a tad more than one meal at Fogo, that is to be expected.  Both Sabor and Fogo offer a much superior cold food bar section.  The meal wasn't horrible, but it just wasn't up to par compared to past experiences.  Thus, I left unsatisfied.    I definitely wouldn't pay full price to dine at Samba, but wouldn't hesitate to return using the Groupon offer.  

Food - 2 stars
Service - 3 stars (Server was at least good.....not enough dudes bringing the skewers of meat around)
Value - 4 stars w/ Groupon"}
{"text":"The food was great, the place/building is gorgeous, a bit too dark, hard to see what you were eating. More beef than you could shake a stick at! But no desserts! Whats up with that? Grilled pineapple does not cut it. Also, I asked the maitre d' if they had Chimarrão and he said what? I said the National drink of Brazil! Yerba Mate! He said he had never heard of it. OMG! A Brazilan restaurant without Chimarrão? What do you think Gauchos drink out of those gourds??? I also asked if the beef was Brazilan and of course it isn't. I think the only thing Brazilian about the place was the name and I would bet there was not a single person there who spoke Portuguese..."}
{"text":"I'm not a big meat-eater, so I wasn't really eagerly anticipating a night at a Brazilian steakhouse. But the salad bar at Samba was a great experience--Spanish cheeses, sweet potato salad, roasted almonds, and fantastic figs. If I were really a vegetarian, I could easily have been satisfied with the salads alone, but I also went for the cranberry duck and ended up satisfied and stuffed."}
{"text":"Came here for the third time last night for restaurant week. We chose Samba because most of the other participating restaurants weren't offering very appealing menu options or a particularly good deal (a lot of restaurants upped their menu to $30 or even $35!!).

The salad bar had many delicious options as usual. The pineapple was great, and probably my favorite part of the meal. Though I don't usually enjoy a meal of just meat, I have liked my meals at Samba the past 2 times I have been there. Last night, however, was pretty disappointing for several reasons.

1) The meats seemed a little more underdone than usual. The LAMB was bloody! I can understand serving beef rare or medium-rare, but LAMB? Especially if the meat is not made to order, I feel that erring on the side of medium is far better than assuming everyone will be happy with bloody meat.

2) No real variety in the marinades/seasoning. The lamb, flank steak, and chicken all had sweet marinades. I really dislike my meat to taste sweet, and was really upset that 3 of the 6 meat options had sweeter marinades.

3) The other 3 meats were so-so. The sirloin was cooked beautifully, but tasted like plain beef. No salt, no pepper, nothing. The parmesan pork tasted yummy, but was really dry and hard to chew. I did not care for the pork sausage, but I didn't like it the last 2 times I came here either.

4) The gauchos cut really bad cuts of meat. The piece of lamb I got was 90% fat. The 10% that was meat was inedible as it was so bloody.

I'm hoping that my experience wasn't great because they were so busy due to restaurant week. I probably won't come back here, as it's only really a good deal during restaurant week."}
{"text":"Samba greets you with the dimly lit remnants of an old theater. Stage and balcony seating are equally present as the smell of grilling meats graces your olfactory senses. The first thing that caught my attention was the number of Gauchos whisking skewers of various meats from table to table.
It was my first experience with a Brazilian Steakhouse, and Samba did not disappoint. The salad/side bar was fully stocked with everything from a house-made chimichurri to the coveted Brazilian cheese breads made from cassava root. I opted to get only the cheese breads, a dab of mashed potatoes, and a few spoonfuls of their curry chicken salad; all of which were as flavorful as I could have hoped for. However, I kept my portions small, as my eyes were on the prize.
When the first of the meats arrived, their red-wine marinated flank steak, everything else fell to the wayside. No longer were my thoughts on the ambience, the setting, or (guiltily) even the friend I was with. The flavor that encapsulated my mind has, to this day, been unequaled. And not a single one of their meats brought any disappointment. The Picanha has remained to be my favorite, and a crown jewel amongst other precious stones. Never before have I had a meal where I couldn't help but smile like a giddy child at every bite. 
I am in Madison monthly, and make it a point to go to Samba every time I am there. For the carnivorous culinary enthusiast, Samba cannot be paralleled."}
{"text":"I know this may be surprising to some, but I think Samba is the best Brazilian Steakhouse I have ever been to. To this date I have now been to some in Chicago, in Kansas, and in Madison and Madison wins hands down! 

I love that when they built this place they put a more casual restaurant downstairs and you have to go upstairs to enter the Brazilian Steakhouse. The outside is always decorated in lights and really creates the right mood before you even enter the building. I have been there 4 different times since it has opened and every time it is amazing. It is cheaper than the ones found in Chicago as well as in Kansas and personally has much better food. 

As soon as you walk in you are greeted by very friendly hostess who always offer to hang up your coats. Each time I have had a reservation I have always been promptly seated. The waiters are pretty quick to come up and offer drinks and explain how the concept of a Brazilian Steakhouse works. Their drink menu is rather large and each time I try a new one it is fantastic! I love going up to their salad bar area where they have an array of items including obviously salad items, vegetables, mashed potatoes (yum!), bread and so much more. Once you have eaten your \"appetizers\" you flip over your coaster to the green side so the men in gauchos know to come around and offer you different cuts of meat. So many of them are good, I always start by trying almost all of them and then once I have decided my favorites of the night I normally have seconds of those specific kinds. 

I also love that most of the nights I have gone (I think 3 out of the 4) they had live bands playing. It fit right into the atmosphere and creates such a nice night every time. The music is never to loud or obnoxious, it is rather enjoyable to get a table near the stage and listen to some great music as you enjoy a fantastic meal. 

You really can not go wrong at such a great place. The main things to remember about this great place: 
1. They have a large selection of original drinks and a large wine menu 
2. The meat is delicious 
3. Relatively inexpensive for a Brazilian Steakhouse 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Impressive space for a date night or corporate event, the salad bar has something for all omnivores and is priced at $19. Worth digging in and you won't miss the sabres of meat floating around."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Brazilian steak house before. This was quite an experience. For those of you who don't know what goes down at these places, let me enlighten you. Basically, people with two foot meat-on-a-stick come to your table and cut the meat right off the slab for you. To me, it seemed a little barbaric and kinda gross. I couldn't get myself to eat much of the different meats they had. However, they had this awesome roasted (?) pineapple on a stick that was so flavorful, it knocked my socks off. I mean, it was REALLY good. 

They also had a impressive salad bar. The salad bar has every salad ingredient you've never heard of. So, for me anyway, since I didn't know what 80% of the ingredients were, I ended up with a pretty pathetic salad. 

They also had warm sides which included some pretty bitchin mashed potatoes.  

Meh, I don't think I'll ever come here again. I'm glad I tried it though."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, called in to perhaps book a reservation and was answered with rudeness. FYI today is Valentine's Day so it makes sense they definitely would be busy. I just wanted to get an idea of wait time for a party of two. The hostess or whoever I spoke with answered sarcastically that of course it's busy and gave no wait time. She sounded annoyed and spoke disrespectfully to me. I told her that being receiving service like this over just the phone makes me not want to come in at all. She proceeded to then act like she could no longer hear me. I am not one to complain and usually give places the benefit of the doubt , but if I am not being treated with the same respect I give out, I will speak out on it."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and decided to go here with my omnivore boyfriend (it was first time going to a Brazilian Grill). I was worried there wouldn't be too many options for me but the salad bar proved me wrong. I thought it was absolutely delicious! The grilled pineapple was awesome as well! My boyfriend really enjoyed the meat options as well! He said it was nice that you didn't have to wait long to be served a different meat. We went here for restaurant week and were not disappointed. The price tag was a smidge high but overall a very nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Great food!!
Service was great and always asking sure we get alot of meat!!
Must try!!"}
{"text":"Samba is one of my and my husband's places to eat for a nice dinner out. It's a little pricey, but everything is always delicious!

The salad bar is beyond amazing. Lots of veggies, cheeses, an amazing balsamic goat cheese, roasted garlic spread, curry chicken, bean salad, and much more.

The meat options are also really good. The parmesan crusted pork tenderloin is one of my favorites, but my absolute favorite is the sugar cinnamon pineapple - it's pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"This was the first time going to Samba and I have to say is that it was amazing. We just recently went on a trip to Brazil and this restaurant definitely did the food justice. We had caipirinhas while here and they tasted great. The price is definitely worth all you can eat meats, I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants a real churrascaria experience. The wait staff was so nice and the atmosphere was very calming and relaxed. The only thing that would of made this better is authentic coxinhas."}
{"text":"Food was terrible, but the candles were real, not those electronic ones. That was cool. 

Music was in Spanish, not Portuguese."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood to eat until your stomach explodes then you found the place!

My wife and I came for a date night, and it offers a unique experience unlike anywhere else in Madison. You have the all you get eat salad bar and all you can eat meats shaved at your table. It was fun, food is good and prices are reasonable. Nothing really blew me away, likely come here once a year to do something just a bit different."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions while I was in Madison, and I love this place! There is a very good selection of meats, and the salad bar is also really great. The cheese bread is delicious! My favorite cut is the top sirloin, it's tender, juicy, and so flavorful! 

And as others have mentioned, the grilled pineapple is definitely a must-have, make sure you ask the server to cut you a slice coated with brown sugar, it's sweet and tangy with a smokey flavor. My friends and I love it so much we tried to make it at home once, and it definitely didn't turn out as good. 

I've also been here for Restaurant Week, and the meat selection is also really decent for the reduced price. The servers are really friendly, and we were seated promptly with reservation. We always have a really good time here, and the restaurant atmosphere is suitable for both semi-formal or casual events. 

Love it!"}
{"text":"Was expecting better! 
The Meats. They come around every 4 minutes or so. Little slices are cut off for you to receive with tongs. Small portions. Only Half the meats were enjoyable for me. Not usually a beef fan but I tried anyway and Found both beef offerings tough and lacking in flavor. The Pork items were the best. All the chicken items were okay but a little dry, and the leg especially underwhelming.
The cold salad bar items were alright, a decent selection. I did enjoy the hot items like the butternut squash soup and the Brazilian stew. The staff (minus the hostess who was not at all welcoming) were pleasant enough, and the space itself was quite lovely. I would not say this experience was worth $37 dollars though, maybe more like $27. 
I was most dismayed by the TOTAL lack of dessert at the Buffett!! No sweets provided?!? Yes, all that $ and desserts are still extra!! 
:(
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely a great meal!  Friday and Saturday evenings you will most likely need a reservation.  

Dinner includes a remarkable salad bar (all you can eat) along with the huge variety of meats brought right to your table.  Meats include: marinated flank steak, top sirloin steak, chipotle flavored filet steak, New York strip steak, lamb, turkey breast wrapped with bacon, Parmesan pork tenderloin, and chicken leg. Meat keeps coming until you signal them to stop.  Grilled cinnamon pineapple is a must that provides a little sweetness to clear the palette between meats.  All of this and great service in an old theatre"}
{"text":"The salad bar is very good! With a variety of food. The grilled meat are all very tasty (esp loved the lamb and tenderloin), and the grilled pineapple fits so well between every meat."}
{"text":"Since this place is known to be a churrascaria I will start my review off with the meats. I am not a fan of \"sweet meats\" aka a meat with any kind of sweet glaze on it. When I went for Sunday brunch the offerings were sausage, flank, and ham. The grilled pineapple--sweet enough already--also had a sweet cinnamon glaze on it. 

The only redeeming quality were the fresh salad bar and fruits. They also had Wisconsin cheese offerings, nuts, and pastries. Sadly the pastries seemed to have come out of a box from Costco. There was also a buffet of scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes. I was really unimpressed by this place but I enjoyed getting my fill of cheap pastries, salad, and potatoes.

Decor was nice. I tried booking a reservation through Open Table but the restaurant wasn't available through the website. Odd.

Was it worth the $15? Meh. Will I be back? Probably--to try the lunch/dinner but probably not for brunch. After all I wasn't able to sample their entire selection of meats."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  But restaurant doesn't put their best foot forward.  You can't find the name Samba on the outside of the restaurant.  We found a small portable sign on the sidewalk that pointed across the street.  The sign is wrong.  You enter the Cabana Room and then go upstairs.  Ugh

Once seated and the process is explained we found we had to fight our way through the salad, vegetable and potato bar.  It is a crowded location and with way too many people using it.  It is in the round with no clear start, so you just jump in front of others.  Double ugh

The meat is served at the table and the selection and taste is great.  The wait staff is very friendly, attentive and helpful.  The rest of the meal went well.  We weren't brave enough to venture back to the vegetable bar but enjoyed the variety of meats served.

The restaurant is noisy.  A loud voice is needed to communicate to anyone sitting at the table, much less to the wait staff."}
{"text":"We had the salad bar and not the meats on this visit. Although the salad bar was super good, we were very disappointed with the pineapple. It's usually our favorite, however many of the pieces we were given were clearly bad or too close to the core. We couldn't even cut them! The server was also inattentive, even when we asked another employee to assist...twice  We were given the impression that he clearly didn't care for his job nor many of his customers. We won't be back for a long time. Too bad because we feel this place is struggling and we were just trying to give it our business."}
{"text":"Early dinner on a Friday. Staff very attentive. Maybe because it wasn't crowded yet. Salad bar was quite good. Hot food was 9 different kind of grilled foods all very good. Kept us full. Had to flip over the indicator.  Much better than Rodizio in Milwaukee. Price $40 per person is reasonable for Brazilian steakhouse."}
{"text":"Don't Bother!

Having been to a variety of Brazilian steakhouses this was pretty disappointing.  The selection of meats was not as great as most places I have been to which would have been reasonable had they not all tasted bad.  I have been to restaurants similar to this at slow times but this was not a slow time, or shouldn't have been.  Beyond the meat, I am traditionally not much of a salad person but very much look forward to the salad bar when I go to Texas de Brazil because it is very high quality and has an expansive selection.  The salad bar here was mediocre at best, considering we are in Wisconsin I was pretty disappointed to see a cheese selection that looked like it was straight off a party platter picked up at the local grocery store on clearance.

I am fairly new to the area and in the past would frequent Brazilian steakhouses about once a month.  From now on it will have to be a special occasion when I am traveling because I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Really great food!!! Pork links, flank steak, pineapple, filet, sirloin, salad bar, bacon wrapped turkey were all highlights. Service was good and wine selection a good  variety. Decor and locale hard to beat, will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I love the salad bar! And their tomato bisque is spicy and yummy! Not to mention their Grilled Pineapple was the BEST!! Good quality food and service was great!"}
{"text":"Maybe a week night was not the time to go to this place, so your experience might vary.  Place was nearly empty on a Tuesday evening, so we were seated right away.  Salad bar was very good with good selection of items and a couple warm appetizer items.  So far so good.  Service became slower as we went to the \"meat phase\" of the meal.  As the meat plate became cluttered with juices and fat, the waiter really didn't pay much attention and offer a new plate.  Meanwhile, the meat selection seemed to be much more limited than other Brazilian steakhouses that I have visited in the past.  I believe there might have been only about 5 substantial cuts of meat that circulated the dining room.  Again, maybe the volume of meat was reflective of the evening we were there.  However, they didn't discount the price for this.
I'll stay \"Big City\" for Brazilian steak in the future."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more, but the food is just not worth how expensive it is.  If you are a large person and can really pack in the meat, I can see the value, but if you are on the smaller side, it's hard to justify the cost. Ribeye and top sirloin are the best.  Also, I don't find the service all that great.  After salad I had dressing all over my plate and even though the servers were not busy, and I had put my plate to the side, no one wanted to take it and bring me a new one.  There's not a lot for the servers to do, so that seemed like a basic request.  Great wine list, however."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best tasting food in Madison. Could not have been satisfied more. They bring you food until you are full and they cut it right there at the table for you to grab and select the amount. I suggest you go light on their amazing selection of a salad bar. Which is so fresh and full of flavors that you want to just keep eating. The server was beyond kind and amazingly helpful. They turned over the food so often and where attentive to our water and drinks level we never needed to think about a empty cup. A must go for those visiting or who live here like me."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good food.  I heard about Samba years back and since then have had several recommendations from friends that it was a place I had to go to.  I wish I had listened to them sooner because this place could arguably be the best restaurant I've ever been to in my life (and I've been to far too many).

We called in to make reservations on Saturday night, but unfortunately found out that they were booked up until an hour later than we originally planned.  That gives you an indicator of its popularity on weekends, but it was well worth the wait.  When you walk in, you're greeted by the Cabana Room, which I'd also recommend although more for the casual bar night where you want to relax with a few friends in upscale atmosphere.

You'll then proceed up to the second level where they provide a free coat check service and seat you in their nice restaurant.  The environment will surely put you in the mood as you take in the aroma of grilled meats, the reddish-yellow candlelight, and the closed-off curtains on the windows.  Your server then gives you a wooden hourglass with a red indicator on one end and a green indicator on the other.  Basically, flip it green-side up and you're advertising that you're hungry, red-side up means you need a break (my group thought it'd be nice to have a triangle with a third side for I can't breathe because I'm so full).

By the time we got done with all the pleasantries, I was starving (I had only eaten one thing that day) so I was a little disappointed when a guy came by with a giant skewer of top sirloin and only gave each one of our party one small piece of meat.  I soon learned though that there was no way I'd go hungry as they kept bringing out round after round of different meats - 8 total, ranging from chicken, parmesan pork, asian steak, flank steak, ribeye, top sirloin, sausage, and lamb.  And they don't bring each one out just once, they KEEP bringing them for as long as the place is open.  I'm normally not a huge fan of all-you-can-eats, but this is the most delicious meat I have ever had and I can only imagine what the real-deal is like in Brazil.  All four of the people in my party were extremely satisfied and easily thought that we got our money's worth.  Even girls that were with me that normally wouldn't eat a lot were chowing down as you just couldn't say no to this food.

But wait, it gets better.  They have an incredible salad bar and hot food line as well.  Often, we'd turn our hourglass over to red to take a break, but then march over to the bar where they had more choices than I've ever seen at any other one before.   There were at least 2-3 types of potato salad, plenty of leafy greens, nuts, berries, exotic choices like maracan almonds, etc etc.  The hot food line had delicious mashed potatoes, cuban black beans, and a tasty broth.  Honestly, it's a shame that these sides and salads are at Samba because anywhere else they'd probably suffice for an excellent meal on their own.  Regardless, you will end up trying some if you can fit it in between the rush of meats.

Lastly, there's entertainment involved too.  The servers bring all the beef over on giant skewers that look just like what greek gyro places use for cooking up their daily loads and you have to use a grabber device to take your meat to your plate as they slice down with a knife.  Make sure to have a good grip though; I didn't see one of the guys cutting mine in time and got a little splash on my dress shirt.  Thankfully, this place is pro, so they came out with club soda and a portable stick of oxy clean to help get the stains out.  Your servers will also be dressed in comical costumes; usually a park ranger hat with khaki oufits and funny-looking pants.  Towards the end of the night, we witnessed some people roll/fall down the stairs from the third floor (they got up and were laughing so nobody was hurt) which definitely capped the night off.

Overall, I can't do this place justice with some words in a paragraph box.  Samba is SO GOOD, and if you can put aside your quibbles in regards to the cost, you will surely not be disappointed in the least.  Budget well, $45-60 a person (you'll probably want drinks, etc), and have a good time."}
{"text":"In my opinion Samba was a bit overrated.  It's pretty expensive, and the salad bar really isn't anything super special. The meat is definitely good but is more than anyone could ever eat."}
{"text":"They have a wide selection of salad bar. And of course, all kinds of meat. 
However, it's just too much for me. Some people like it best, but I am okay. 
Not to mention, it's too pricey :)"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast this morning and it was good for the most part! 

The good:
-The meats were tasty (except the sausage which was too salty for me)
-The chocolate croissants were soooo good
-A fair amount of fresh fruit offered
-Yummy Cheses

The not-so-good:
-We waited in the lobby 5 minutes before being acknowledged/seated
-The hot foods from the buffet were wayy too salty- I wasn't able to take more than a couple bites of each (potatoes,  scrambled eggs, bacon)
-It took 20 minutes to get the check after our plates had been cleard

The main thing we came here for was the meat, though, and that was delicious; Flank steak and ham-yum! The brunch cost $15.95/person"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to go if u are hungry bc food is served fast and hot plus you have the open salad bar. Down side is that vegetarians have an option of no meat and only only salad bar (cheaper), but carnivores don't have an option for only meat & no salad bar. But definitely worth the visit, specially if you want a nice quiet dinning experience."}
{"text":"If you want a Brazilian food just skip this place. Brazilian churrasco it's seasoned with salt only salt and not bbq sauce. Plus the server wasn't nice he seemed mad with something. The only Brazilian dish that they have that is close to Brazilian food was the potato salad and to not be unfair the pineapple was good but that was all."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here.   Excellent experience.  Love the atmosphere.  Food was excellent.  Expertly cooked.  The no meat/side options were excellent.  The tenderloin, lamb and serloin were my favorites, as were the garlic mashed potatoes, asparagus &  Brazilian Stew.  Solid caprainas also."}
