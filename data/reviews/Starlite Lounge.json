{"text":"Man this place is a dump. If you're not a local or regular good luck feeling comfortable there. It is obviously a local bar first and restaurant second. Certainly not for the ladies or kids. The pierogies were indeed delish and the fish sammo was okay. It was cooked nicely but the fish wasn't all that fresh and you could tell. Btw, I did not pre-order pierogies and I got mine no problem. But it wasn't during peak hours.   As noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender. A bit gruff, but I've had worse. Music was BLASTING non-stop during my hour there. A Nickelback fan's dream com true. Smoky, but not horribly so.   If you're a local rummy barfly then this place is for you! But if you're a DDD fan you might want to move on to another DDD spot in Pittsburgh. Not sure why it would be featured on the show. Nadine's was better and they made you feel welcome."}
{"text":"PIEROGI ARE GREAT!! FOOD IS GOOD, BUT This place is a dive. It was on drive ins diners and dives about 10 years ago. But the Pierogi are the bomb. I will go there again for the Pierogi they are that good. It is hard to really rate a restaurant or bar such as this.  The food is good but the place needs remodeled, or is that the CHARM that they want??? 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very old world with the emphasis on old. However, one bite of a pierogi that has been exquisitely fried will make it all worth while. I had the pierogis, haluski and kielbasa platter. It was very filling and very tasty.   Barkeep was friendly and helpful. Patrons were all from the neighborhood. I'll return.   I'm feeling very Polish now."}
{"text":"As boring inside as it looks outside. Blah. No one was mean and bottled beer is bottled beer but I might as well have stayed home.  A good bar is more than just 4 walls and counter to belly up to.  Depressing."}
{"text":"Wing night is the best! Have yet to try the rest of the menu items which all look amazing. The bar is a bit smokey but hey, it's worth the food."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is my absolute favorite place to come and play bluegrass music on a Tuesday nite.  I fly here from TN just to be part of it - when I can :)"}
{"text":"This place is one of the burghs hidden Gems!Wings, Fish Sandwich, and Pierogis are my favorites. There is a bar in the front, and a dining room in the back for families to eat. Non smoking untill the kitchen closes. They have a Juice Box, haha and Golden Tee as well."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have come for lunch and I have the place to myself-- which is ok for me, but too bad for you! The soups are homemade excellent- just had the chicken and dumpling. So good. Now on to the famous pierogis which are tops. Ok, Starlight isn't trendy/swank but that's just another plus in its appeal column. I consider a place like Starlight a treasure where more and more, places like it are being replaced by chain crap. Do yourself a favor - come here, get some real food done well at an awesome price, and ditch the fast food and the not-so fast food places that make the food in Omaha or somewhere, freeze it (last year) so it can be fresh-microwaved today."}
{"text":"Husband and I have been here several times and while the food is ok, the slow service makes each experience worse than the one before. We have been here for 40 minutes and still waiting for our soup, there's only one other table....ridiculous...the hype of triple D will only last so long."}
{"text":"Food is good when the waitress can properly charge you. I get the same meal constantly and pay different prices everytime. Owner is rude & doesn't handle customers well. My job places fairly large orders and they up-charge when there is more people so I advise to place orders separately. They also give smaller portions when you order in a group. Food can be as greasy as the bar is sometimes but i gotta say the pierogies are ok. I  will never place an order for me & my coworkers again."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good especially if you like perogies but good luck getting it. I've been here a few times to see acoustic performances and every time I'm here the waitress spends more time smoking cigarettes at the bar than attending to her tables. 98% of the time I have to go to the bar to get another beer. But damn the perogies are good."}
{"text":"I heard this place makes some fab food so I decided to give it a shot after work. I walk in past the huge bar in the front of the place and into the restaurant in the back. The have a fireplace going and the other tables are full of other patrons enjoying their dinner. There is a sign which says please seat yourself, so I took off my jacket and grabbed a table by the wall. I sat there as other people were getting to order and the waitress cleared the table off next to me, after sitting and not even being greeted, let alone given silver ware or asked what to drink, I turned on the timer on my watch, and waited an additional 10 minutes by the timer. I then picked up my jacket and walked outside and left. After 20 minutes of waiting you can't even acknowledge my existence it's quite obvious you don't want my business. So the Starlite Lounge may have the greatest food on the planet, I'll never know, because after the way I was disrespected, I will never set foot in the establishment again, and I will discourage others from doing so as well."}
{"text":"Don't come here for the atmosphere, come for a taste of what Slavic/Polish food is supposed to taste like. As someone who spent years in Pittsburgh but never ate here until recently, it is a revelation.   I know this was on the Food Network and all, but it's not really a dive as places in this area go. It's a standard working class lounge with a restaurant in the back that happens to serve darn good food, if that kind of food is your cup of tea.   If you have never had standard Slavic food, you won't find it much better anywhere outside of the old country. Go try it."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. For a dive bar, you can get past the not so great decor and slim menu, but awful and rude wait staff is NEVER acceptable. Save your cash for one of the million other places that service the same food - but better -and dont have the rude and awful waitresses that Starlite has."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good. Fish sandwich was one of the best I've had. Never eat fried fish, but gave it a try. Tarter sauce seemed homemade (hate it when you get pre-packaged). Fries - hot! Fresh! Yum! Slaw had great flavor.   Now let's talk Pierogis - amazing! My husband got the platter. Never have I seen such large ones. Filling was terrific. Creamy and rich.  Top it off - beer came in a frosty glass. Frosty glades are way under rated. Every bar and restaurant should do this!"}
{"text":"I suspect that folks who rate this establishment as \"poor\" probably were expecting a pizazzy hyped up version of eat n park.  Marc C is so right:  dont gho there if you arent prepared to enjoy good \"bar-food\" along with the quintessential \"bar-flies.\"  However, we've been there twice, both times for pierogies, and they've been wonderful both times.   I had the grilled chicken salad this time and it really isnt anything to write home about.  The Starlight has made its reputation on wings which are the biggest I've ever seen, and O'course the pierogies.  The hoagies are also an amazing feat of sandwich-artistry.   Dont go if you want ambiance or culture.  Take yourself to the Cafe at the Frick instead.  However, if you want a family - business where grandma makes the spinach-feta pierogies - give it a try and post your thoughts!"}
{"text":"Went here because we saw it on the Food Network Diners Drive-ins and Dives.  Their pierogies were the featured food of course.  It's just a small bar.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and there were a bunch of old guys sitting around the bar smoking and talking about the old days.  The bartender was also our waitress.  Aside from first-impressions, the service was good and the pierogies were amazing.  Three big pierogies for about $7, great for sharing.  We also ordered a burger with fries to share and it was good too!  And CHEAP!  We got stuffed, couldn't even finish everything for $15.  If you don't mind the smokey, old-time bar feel, then I highly recommend.  On their website, they say to call ahead for the pierogies."}
{"text":"Good italian hoagies, great jumbo wings. Very affordable. Will get something polish next time"}
{"text":"Sounds like an incredible place to eat I just saw your restaurant on Food TV and they showed your Perogi,  I'd love to have the recipe if your willing to share"}
{"text":"There are some hidden gems in the area that are still \"old\" Pittsburgh and this is one of them.  The atmosphere is classic, the people are great and the food is amazing.   Things to try:  - Fish sammy - Pierogies (all of them are great) - Wings - Meatloaf - Burgers  Basically the entire menu is fabulous ... You could try anything and probably enjoy it.   Every Tuesday, there is a an old-school bluegrass jam in the back room.  You can bring an instrument and play along, or just find a seat and listen.  It's a true jam -- they go around the circle and ask if you want to lead a bluegrass tune ... if not, you just pass and play along to the next song that's called.    All around good people and always a good time."}
{"text":"Been going here for a year now. The pierogies are the best in the business! As others have mentioned, if you need catered to and fancy surroundings, this isn't the place for you! However, if you're looking for great food and feeling like you're with family, this is your place! Every time we go, we have a great time! And it's clean. Even the bathroom! I'll continue to travel 40 min to go here!"}
{"text":"Thursday night wing night. Great value.  Wings were outstanding.  Bar keep attentive and friendly.   The place is a dive, nothing pretentious."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to rate this place.  So we too saw it on food network.  Being from a small down in PA, I can attest, this place is a DIVE.  It is like the kind of dive where a couple of people from the neighborhood surely spend every day in here at the bar smoking and drinking.  You have to KNOW what you are getting into before you go here, and if that makes you uncomfortable, better not go.  Me on the other hand, if they have something delicious, I will go.  The pierogies were 5 stars.  Best I have ever eaten and obviously homemade and HUGE!  The rest of the food was reasonably cheap and pretty tasty.  The wings were pretty great too.  I normally wouldn't even walk into, let alone eat at a place like this, but all of their other food was surprisingly good.  I know darn well when I walked in with my family and kids everyone in the entire bar and the staff looked at us like, there are some city slickers coming in because they saw us on D,D, & D.  Yup.  Damn straight.  Yuns gimme dem dar pierogies up dar over dar."}
{"text":"I stopped in here last night for dinner with my girlfriend.  I had been wanting to come here since I randomly caught it on an episode of \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" and last night was the perfect night for us.  The outside of the building is unassuming and we drove right past it before noticing that we had.  The inside of the building is not much better as it looks like your normal neighborhood bar with a bunch of flat screens T.V's on the wall, a U shaped bar on one side, booths and high top tables on the other and a back dining room.  My girlfriend and I tried to sit in the back but there was something going on there and so we eventually settled into one of the booths.  The bar seemed quite full for a Tuesday evening and our waitress (the bartender) told us that she would get to us shortly after we had seated ourselves.  After only a short wait, she was at our table taking our drink order.  I was actually impressed with how efficient she was by herself with the large crowd.  For dinner I decided to order the famous fish sandwich and a plate of pierogies (3) while my girlfriend went with the buffalo chicken wrap.  Our food came out within a reasonable time period and looked good with both of our sandwiches served with cole slaw.  The pierogies were absolutely enormous, almost as long as my hand and fried slightly, topped with onions and came with a side of applesauce.  Our waitress had asked us if we had wanted sour cream with them to but we politely declined.  They tasted pretty good as the slight fry gave them a crunchy exterior while the interior was soft and tasty.  By the time we were done with them, we had also eaten all of the applesauce as it made a good dipping sauce and helped keep the pierogies moist.  My sandwich was also pretty good as the breading on it was fried nicely and tasted good while the fish was mild.  I topped it with hot sauce and like a true Pittsburgher even put my cole slaw on it which helped to make it taste better. My girlfriend told me that she enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap and the single bite that I took gave me a nice buffalo flavor.  The bottom line for me is that I am glad that I came here and might be back again depending on what I am looking for.  The food was dirt cheap with our whole bill coming to $22 and it exceeded the expectations that I had given to it whenever we walked in.  However, with that being said, the building is fairly run down and it is bar food and so I wouldn't expect it to be the greatest food you have ever tasted."}
{"text":"My dad wanted to go to this place because he saw it on TV. I grew up on in dive bars plopped on stools next to my grandfather as he drank Budweisers. Thus we felt at home.  This is a dive bar. A real dive bar, not some phony hipster bar pretending to be a dive bar. Yes, its grimy, yes there will be people shaking from acute withdrawal sitting near you. If you have never been to a dive, or are not sure you have been to a dive, you might want to try somewhere else.  Budweisers are 2.25, food is cheap and comes in huge portions. Pierogies are gargantuan, the fish sandwich is even bigger. Standard bar food on the menu with a few nice Polish selections. Service is nonchalant yet friendly enough. An elderly woman in the back does all the cooking by herself. She is awesome."}
{"text":"Authentic neighborhood dive bar with friendly patrons and nice bartenders and waitresses.  Excellent wings and cheap beer.  Check it out before hitting moon dogs for live music!"}
{"text":"Well do NOT discount this off the beaten track venue. They are supposedly known for awesome pierogies and YES, YES, YES they are as good as a home made pierogi gets.  I'm actually not sure if my polish grandmother could make any better.  OH my, big, fat, stuffed pierogi sauteed in butter and onion ..... well that pretty much says it all there. The Starlight lounge is a very old neighborhood bar and now bar/restaurant serving some pretty darn good comfort polish food and fish.  Belly up to the bar, order yourself a drink from the friendly bartender, get yourself a plate of delicious old world style pierogi and ENJOY !!!    Friendly, affordable and delicious.  Sometimes amazing things come in unexpected places."}
{"text":"Starlight lounge is associated with Moondog's Blues music venue.  Clearly the local population liked the Starlight Lounge.  Whenever I would walk up from Moondog's to get a short order of food while waiting for a music group at Moondog's, they had a decent loading of customers.  Wait staff has been excellent each time; food is but bar food.  There is no five star chef working here.  Last time I ordered, the waitress placed the order, then the cook came out and... in front of me ... chastised her for allowing a \"side\" that wasn't part of the options.   No points made with me there.  I've rated this a 2 but it could easily a 1....   // on edit, and a comment from my partner, we are changing this to a 1.  She will never eat from there again apparently.//.  If you are going to Moondog's, and ask for food, you will be referred to the Starlight lounge.  Think ahead, and eat ahead.  You can do better.  Any national chain fast food will be better.  f8 and be there."}
{"text":"We're visiting from Milford, Ohio.  We picked this place because we love eating at places featured on the Food Network, especially on Diners, Dives and Drive Ins.  Dive?  Ummmm, yea.  for sure.  I know Guy Fieri says, \"if its funky, we'll find it.\"  but I just couldn't imagine him there!  talk about a small, tiny, bar.   Would NEVER have gone here if we weren't looking for it.   The waitress/bar maid was VERY nice.  She recommended what was served to Guy; the fish sammy and the perogies.  i've never had perogies.  From what I understand, perogies are very small.  these were huge.  I don't know, I'm sure they were awesome........I just don't think they are for me.  It was  like fried mashed potatoes.   I'm thinking Perogies is a cultural/area food.   Just not something I'm going to crave.       The fish sam was good.   Seemed the patrons are regulars.     This is not a place I would crave; not a place I would visit again if I were back in town.  But thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"Friendly homey atmosphere (loved the Christmas tree and fire place) great comfort food esp loved the stuffed peppers, fish sandwiches, \"Pittsburgh\" salad and burgers all at amazing prices. A really fun night out. Loved being able to hear talented live music all at the same time! A must on our list of Pittsburgh institutions!"}
