{"text":"Stopped in randomly the other night.  Wonderful surprise. Great food, and even better service. I don't live in the area. But I will be back.  Thank you."}
{"text":"We arrived for dinner on Friday evening at 7pm. Right from the onset, the service was outstanding. Our server was intuitive, attentive and respectful.   The ambiance is excellent - dim lighting, intimate and the perfect music.  The drinks were on-point.   We ordered the following items:  Cauliflower Croquettes $12 - 10/10 Dukkah Avocado Salad $15 - 10/10 Arancini $16 - 10/10 Black Fettuccini $22 - 10/10  The freshness of the ingredients and flavors infused into the dishes were outstanding. The originality exemplified by the chefs is rare. All of the dishes were superb and worth every penny.   I highly recommend Pollyanna."}
{"text":"Very good food - I had the burger and my friend had an octopus dish which she really enjoyed.  It was definitely better than pub fare.  Simple presentation with high quality ingredients.  Service was fast and friendly and pricing reasonable.   They weren't taking credit cards that night (Nov 3, 2017).   The room was very noisy due to the volume of people talking, so you couldn't have a quiet conversation (not on a Friday night anyway).  Washrooms were neat and clean."}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and service was very good however the food was mediocre at best.   None of the entrees we ordered were particularly good including the pork belly that was dry and not very tasty.   Probably better to stick to their burgers or chicken.  Do not order the cauliflower croquettes.  For $12 you get 3 tiny croquettes and I mean tiny.  They even have the nerve to sell additional croquettes for $4 each - talk about gouging"}
{"text":"Pollyanna is the ultimate crowd pleaser! Their menu o fried chicken, double cheese burgers, octopus fettuccine, bone marrow, crispy pork belly, fresh cut fries, and more; makes it easy for every person to find something to be excited about! The service was very good with very down to earth servers. They accommodated a reservation for a group of 8 that was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Nice trendy romantic vibe, perfectly planned menu, attentive service. Need more places like this in the east end."}
{"text":"We've been to Polly Anna several times for dinner and absolutely loved it. Great atmosphere, awesome service, and delicious food! They just opened up for brunch recently and we gave it a try. My husband had the cured salmon patty and I have a mushroom hash. They were both amazing! I literally wanted to lick the plate because the roux on the mushroom hash was heavenly. The owners and staff were so pleasant and welcoming. Will definitely be our new brunch spot!"}
