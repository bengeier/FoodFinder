{"text":"I had vegetarian pad Thai here and it was hands down the worst I've had in my entire life. Weirdly oily, limp old sprouts, cheap cabbage and broccoli piled on to compensate for the lack of tofu. So gross I didn't finish it. 
The decor is hilarious, it looks like my grandmas kitchen in 1983. 
Not clean cutlery or glasses either. 
Am I missing something here because this place has been here forever and seems busy?! Maybe the Hungarian food it good?"}
{"text":"Great service. Good pad thai and green curry. Not very original but still worth a try. Badly decorated."}
{"text":"I don't know about you guys but Hungarian-Thai fusion is not something I've ever seen before.  I probably didn't pick the best thing on the menu, but all in all the food was actually not so memorable considering the potential for surprising combinations of flavours.  It actually just seemed like average bar food, a little bland even, but honestly I didn't really give the menu enough attention for a really good review.  It did smell and taste like a lot of the food is deep fried.  The atmosphere is pretty great on the patio though, and I'd come again if only for a beer in the sunshine in the market."}
{"text":"Hungary Thai is exactly what it sounds like, Thai food and Hungarian food. It's owned and operated by two women, one cooks and one serves.

It's not high end by any means but it's not crappy food that's for sure.
The Thai soups are great, and who doesn't want to order Hungarian beets and Thai rolls?

The patio in the summer is small and quaint. It's a real neighborhood staple, and feels kinda like having dinner at your grandmothers house when you go by."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business?

The food is terrible. 

A Pad Thai that tastes like water is 12$. 6 tiny shrimp on a bed of rice is $14 smothered in something that tastes exactly like Kraft BBQ sauce. 

So the food is total crap. 

The tables and chairs are made out of 199$ ikea tables and 15$ chairs. 

The owner was really nice... But it's time to retire.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Bill was $47 for 2 people."}
{"text":"We went in because of the cool, funky exterior. Nothing too special about the menu or prices, just kind of seemed like your average thai place, but with some hungarian food on the menu as well. My friend ordered a salad, which was lacking in size for it price (9$), even though it was meant to be a side salad. I ordered the chicken Phad Thai, which looked and smelled delicious. A few bites in, however, I noticed the chicken was undercooked!! I gave it back to the waiter, who was cold and unapologetic. (I know this is not a reflection of everyone who works there, but this particular guy was rude) Needless to say, we didn't leave a tip."}
{"text":"The basil tofu is amazing. This was my first experience with Thai food, & I was pretty skeptical, but my god it was delicious. The service was iffy -- it was fast, but the waitress was pretty surly until I gave her a 25% tip. That brightened her up a bit. Fight ageism, fellow students! Tip awesome!"}
{"text":"The Food was not bad.. I was hungry and it hit the spot ... :) 
The waitress very slow moving the service was not fast - lots of smoke on the patio, which got in the restaurant, yucky while your eating!"}
{"text":"This is a great place right in the middle of Kensington. The Hungarian food is extremely good. The Thai is not bad, however; if it's just Thai you're looking for you won't be disappointed but their are better Thai food restaurants near by. If you want to hear a sad story, ask how the restaurant came to be and you will see why the Hungarian food is better."}
{"text":"The food was actually a pleasant surprise but left much to desire. I had chicken schnitzel which came with house fries and coleslaw. The schnitzel itself was good but not worth the price. The fries were not good at all as well as the coleslaw which was way too strong. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"No air conditioning in the summer, so customers cook faster than their mediocre and overpriced pad thai. Service was rude and slow, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Worst experience with service from a waiter (while the owner sat, smoking, and watched) we've ever experienced in our entire lives.  

We explained to the waiter that we have food allergies so we needed to ask exactly what was in the soup in terms of ingredients.  We have allergies to some vegetables (sad but true).  The waiter said he had no idea what veggies are in the soup, so we asked him if he could please go and ask and let us know.  He was annoyed that we asked!  Have they never had anyone there with food allergies before?  And the waiter really has no idea what's in one of the only two soups on the Thai side of the menu?  

He returned and told us that they cannot change anything.  So we enquired about a stir fry.  He again said he has no idea what's in it.  We again asked him to please find out.  He came back and told us, and some of the veggies we're allergic to were indeed in the dish.  We asked if he could please substitute with broccoli or bokchoy or even celery.  Since these were in the soup we assumed they had them in the kitchen so it would be easy for them.  I should add that they were NOT busy.  We were only the second table of customers in the entire place.  The waiter told us that they have NO vegetables in their restaurant and that we should leave and go somewhere else.  

Then he looked at my husband, gave him a foul look, and he removed the water glasses from our table before we even stood up!  The owner sat at the next table, smoking (we were outside), talking in Hungarian to our waiter about us.   Stupid man.  I'm Hungarian.

Rude is too mild a word to describe how we were treated.  Why is this restaurant still in business?"}
{"text":"Having lived in either Mississauga or Toronto for almost all my life, it's a sad fact that I know very little about anything Toronto outside of the downtown core. A visit here with a friend marked my first trip to an area that, until this day, I'd only ever heard about: Kensington Market. It was also a first in another way... I'd never had Hungarian food before, and that was going to change.

Being unfamiliar with Hungarian cuisine, I deferred to my friend who also happened to be Hungarian. She suggested that I go with the Gypsy Schnitzel (Pan-fried natural schnitzel smothered with garlic-pepper topped with onion fritters, and a chunk of bacon with side of potatoes), so I did. Naturally, she went Thai (!) and ordered a green curry veggie dish. We paired our dishes with a glass of the house red (On that day, it was a Cabernet-Shiraz blend). I've definitely tasted better Thai curry dishes in the past, but the Gypsy Schnitzel was a 10/10. For dessert, we went with crepes (2, filled with strawberry jam/nutella) and coffee. 

Our host/server was very welcoming and the space itself was very cozy and inviting. Colourful painted murals line one wall of the restaurant and add to the \"mashup\" environment of the restaurant. 

Overall, a great experience! I'll be looking out for this place the next time I'm in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food I've had. Tasted burnt and very greasy and almost inedible. I won't come back."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer mentioned, the patio is half of the greatness of this place. It's great to sit here on a warm sunny day with a cold drink. My friend and I ordered from the Thai menu - a vegetarian red curry and the shrimp pad thai. Both were flavorful and bolder flavors than most Thai restaurants I've eaten at. The atmosphere is very laid back, and the waitress (who I gather is also the owner) didn't come up front to show us a table when we walked in, nor did she ask us how the meal was, but she was very friendly, and we kind of preferred it that way."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, friendly service, and yummy food. I had the pad thai with shrimp and my partner had the cashew stir fry. 9/10 i find pad thai too spicey but this had just the right amount of kick and the cashew stir fry had such flavourful veggies. one of my favourite parts of the experience was drinking a singha and people watching out the window. i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here because we were starving - although it doesn't look like much from the outside, I had the best green curry of my life!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for the thai!  I think their specialty is the schnitzel.
My curry chicken and my friend's pad thai came with black pepper on them.  Who does that?!

Cheesy decor, TV in the background, it reminded me of some place trying to be tropical."}
{"text":"The food is alright, not the best Thai food or the best Hungarian in town. And I don't see the fusion here either. It has a nice patio outside so in the summer I see it as a great spot for hang out in Kensington market. 

Goulash is pretty good,  so is the schnitzel. Maybe I am more picky for Thai food, I didn't like their Pad Thai that much. The green curry was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I had the worst thai food experience here.

My roommate and I couldn't even finish our meals. We didn't have the heart to inform the nice waiter so we took it to go and threw it out as soon as we got outside."}
{"text":"I had chicken schnitzel, which was okay. The accompanying potato wedges were lukewarm, greasy, and bland. The small side of coleslaw was tasteless. Got a shock when I received a bill for $20, but I should have checked the menu for pricing!!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Country Style when I'm hankering for a \"taste of home\" but when I'm closer to the market, we go to Hungary Thai and it's never a disappointment.
Fast, friendly service, cozy, warm atmosphere and great Thai and Hungarian flavors with a large menu and big portions. Will surely go back whenever I'm in the area and craving either. The chef making this homesick Hungarian girl a special plate of nokedly doesn't hurt either! Recommend, especially in the evening for a lovely, bohemian, social outing with friends for lots of wine and great food, or in warm weather on the patio to people watch. Good resty!"}
{"text":"The service here was despicable. The only reason I gave this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1 is because the veggie noodles with house sauce were tasty. HOWEVER, I ate less than half of my plate and asked for a box before paying. Then I guess while I was paying (and my friend was in the washroom) the server cleared my plate - NOT my friend's, which was almost finished - and threw it away... WITHOUT asking if I was finished. When I brought this to the server's attention - who also seemed to be managing the place - he protested that I should have said something... and didn't offer any compensation. Paying ~$15 for a plate of veggie noodles is pretty steep, but when a server's accident becomes a \"Sorry, I can't do anything\" then you better believe a customer will leave dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I give them 2 stars for trying to make a fusion out of two very different cuisines. That can be tough and they've got a pretty good sized menu to choose from. I ordered the vegetarian noodles though and wasn't very impressed. It didn't have the authentic Thai flavor to it and was much too eggy. My friend ordered the paprikash and it had a hair in it! The manager made the dish for us again but didn't offer any discount or anything. That pretty much ruined our appetite for the rest of the meal. If you're looking for a new fusion place, check this out. If you're looking for more authentic flavors though, I'd skip it."}
{"text":"The mushroom stew here is absolutely delicious. It's not on the menu but they will prepare it if you ask. It's a dumpling type dish and I love it!"}
{"text":"Pad thai was horrible.  Service not great. I would never go back! We had people from out of town and they were very disappointed as well."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, truly hungarian!
The Hungarian Combo is a real treat for 2.
Brassói is delicious.
5 stars."}
{"text":"After 2 hours of doing Free Hugs at the Kensington Market Pedestrian Sunday, my friends and I went here for some dinner. My friend and I shared 2 dishes. The Schnitzel and Green Mango. The dishes were fairly tasty, nothing spectacular but good. The prices are a little over-rated considering the quality and amount of food. 

My other friends tried their fruit drinks which they said were way too sweet!!! My beer drinking friend said their beer was too expensive; the cheapest beer was $5. 

The servers are older Hungarian ladies, pleasant but not overly friendly or chatty. The atmosphere was ok, the place is older and the interior kind of dates the place. Would I go back, maybe?"}
{"text":"What a crazy combo, but it works. Sitting at a sidewalk table people watching is worth the nickle all by itself, but the food is pretty good here! The hungarian is quite delicious; the thai nothing to write home about. The proprietor was sweet and funny and friendly, and all around, this was a pleasant experience, but I'd just go for the hungarian next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is fantastic and I keep coming back for the green curry :) one of my favourite places to get Thai food in the city. The staff is not overly friendly but the flavours make up for it!"}
{"text":"Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Came here with my partner. She is Hungarian, so we thought to check it out. It was actually my first time having Hungarian food. I got the Chicken Paprikash, and she got the schnitzel. We were both fairly disappointing. The food wasn't horrible, but we both found it a bit underwhelming. The portion sizes were fairly large and decent which I appreciated, and the service was wonderful. Our server was very friendly. But the food itself was meh. Me and her most likley wont be coming back. Again, it wasn't bad.... but I would rather save my $ and spend it on a place I know is tastier, or try a new place out. I feel bad writing this for the owners, like I said, the service was very friendly and the portions were great, but the food we found underwhelming. Just to get an idea, i ended up making my own chicken paprikash at home eventually with some thighs, legs, Hungarian paprika, etc. and it was much tastier... Their spaetzle was better than the one I made though at least! :P 

I hope that the food gets a bit better, and maybe I will visit again. I liked the place, but sadly we didn't enjoy the food as much."}
{"text":"Shnitzel was amazing.

This place is a fusion between hungariam and thai food.

The people are amazing and kind. The patio is basically on the street and it's a cool location in Kensington.

Their menu items are amazing and portions are huge.

You should definitely try it."}
{"text":"Not your typical Thai place. The menu is half Thai and half Hungarian. I had the red curry which was great. Great sangria too. If you can squeeze a spot on the patio in the summer months you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Portions are large and the lemongrass was perfect. Great beer on tap and did I mention the service? Great! Been in Toronto for two weeks, so far the best for I've had yet"}
{"text":"The Goulash was too salty. The consistency was great, I could smell all the herbs and condiments, but not even the bread helped removing the itch on the tongue.

The gypsy plate was tasty. I really liked how they cooked the bacon."}
{"text":"Satay was two skewers and didn't taste at all like satay should taste. Not worth the price. The lemongrass vegetarian curry tasted ok but there was at least as much oil in it as there was rice. Gross. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Well, it has a cool name. And it would be perfect if, say, you loved Thai but your dinner companion hated Thai and liked Hungarian...

However, when I went here the food was expensive and rather mediocre. The ambiance was 1970s kitchen. The service was... strange. The waitress would just stand silently behind me for who-knows-how-long until I noticed her. And after giving us the bill she seemed to completely forget we were there, we had to flag her down to give her our credit cards even though she walked by like fifty times. Not the greatest place to drop $50 for a two-person dinner."}
{"text":"we found this place while exploring kenisington , sat afternoon, the temp crossing over into the 90's. what we found here was a little slice of heaven. a small patio with a nice breeze ( and umbrella)  and a menu that packed the best of two worlds. one Thai, the other Hungarian.  we had the pad thai w/chicken, and the cabbage rolls.  both very tasty  and large in portions. while i loved both.. especially the cabbage rolls.. Belinda did mention  the pad thai might be a bit too lemony.  but not overly so.

the cabbage rolls on the other hand...more like cabbage balls the size of softballs.. surrounded by sweet sauerkraut, topped with sour cream..dashed with paprika.. (if you're getting the idea these were the hit of lunch, you're right). we could not finish them there was soo much.  but if you're looking to enjoy the closest thing to a home cooked meal...this is the place.

the waiter, very very nice ...although he might have won the lottery by now  , at least i hope so."}
{"text":"The pad Thai was weird. Egg rolls were ok.  The satay was decent. Service was acceptable. Just was the wrong Choice for us."}
{"text":"Been there, done that. We won't be back. 

We did the full Hungary Thai experience. I had the cabbage rolls.  Ok, a nice dry.  My DC had the tofu goreng and she was not pleased.  They had Dos Equis (a plus) but a shady and cold patio (a minus). Service has friendly but the food is too expensive."}
{"text":"Quaint little place with friendly service but we didn't find anything special here unfortunately with regards to the Thai side of the menu. 

Hungarian dishes were true to their taste but it seems like that style spilled over to the Thai menu. Dishes were bland and surprisingly underwhelming. 

The Thai curry soup was anything but. Lots of veggies which I was nice but not much chicken and not a lot of taste to the broth. The soup is also not large enough to share so order two if you're hungry. It does come in a great old-fashioned pot from the old country. 

Chicken satay was a little on the overpriced side for small two skewers. I wouldn't suggest it as a starter unless you're alone. 

The reviews here seem to be pretty much on target but we thought we'd give it a shot despite a low rating.  Don't think we'll be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"My friend and I got refused service because they \"were serving lunch\" and we wanted to buy Thai Iced Tea.  As paying customers, I don't understand how we were being denied service over the fact that we weren't spending as much as other customers. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"usually i try not to judge a book by its cover, but this time i probably should have.  the food wasn't too bad but the service was odd.  i had a small hair at the bottom of my food and when i brought it up to the waiter (not angrily) he was totally apathetic.  all i got was an empty apology; he even was watching the football game while i was talking.  i don't expect a free meal but really?"}
{"text":"Weird service, tasty if somewhat pricey food...

After packing up the half plate I asked to take home, the waiter accidentally dumped the takeout box out onto the table... Then scooped the food back into the box and gave it to me!"}
{"text":"It's a little bit Hungarian and a little bit Thai and whole lotta - what the....?     Wanting to grab a quick bite to eat my friends and I stopped in here because we were curious about this mix.

The service (I'm assuming the owner) was friendly enough, the décor kinda tacky but made for an interesting view.  

The menu - well all over the place - there was typical Hungarian food listed - schnitzel, there was goulash listed (they have a bowl size and a large cup size) and my friend ended up ordering this said it was just ok.

We ordered for the table to share - shrimp noodle dish, eggplant schnitzel and a fried rice dish, goulash and a salad.  The portion sizes were pretty decent - plenty of food for the 5 of us but I wasn't particularly impressed.  It was a bit bland regarding spice level and too salty.  There wasn't anything Thai about the dishes that I could discern."}
{"text":"Great lil restaurant in the hear of Kensington market ..
It's a fusion mix of hungarian and Thai    I know weird right ! ..but heck ..There was a Chinese greek on evans Ave in etobicoke for a few years ...anyways .....
I strongly recommend you choose the Hungarian part of the menu for 2 reasons ........
1 the owner and chefs of the restaurant are hungarian
2 read above lol .....no thai person working there i guess they learned it from travel and or whatever ..
But the hungarian food is pretty badass delicious. 

So all in all good food give em a try ."}
{"text":"Not great. The \"Hungarian\" I tried (chicken) was topped with what tasted like Thai sauce. That totally did not work. My friend's Thai dish was limp and not great. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I believe the place is run by a couple of elderly ladies and that sort of adds to the charm of the place. I read that a few people find that the service is not up to the mark and I'd have to disagree keeping their age in mind. In fact I think its quite nice to see them managing the place on their own and not just hiring staff at minimum wage and making their lives that much easier. I believe its the same story in the kitchen as well. I've not had too much of their thai food so I can't really comment. I have tried their satay chicken though which is excellent. I love cordon bleu and is the only thing I order whenever I have eaten here. It is served with fries which are great too and this white sauce which goes perfectly with the chicken! servings are large and you'll be pretty stuffed by the end of it. The inside seating is a bit of a miss for me to be honest but sitting outside in the summer is great. I still have to try Schnitzel Queen which is supposed to be the best schnitzel in Toronto. I wonder if it will be able to beat Hungary Thai though."}
{"text":"chicken pad thai.  I make better at home but it was alright.  wife had the mango with shrimp, she enjoyed it.  I wasn't impressed.  won't be rushing back but I wouldn't tell anyone to run away either."}
{"text":"Expensive and wasn't that memorable.  

I had the weiner schnitzel, came with potatoes.  I asked if I could get rice instead but I was told no.  Potatoes were very greasy and unflavorful.  Tasted like something I could make at home.

Friend had the eggplant schnitzel.  She also was not too pleased with it.  

Very expensive and the quality wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food, I dunno what else to say for this random pick around such a great area. The pad Thai noodles we ordered had lots of burned small parts from the cooking pot, and the dessert was filled with black bananas. Mum had a diarrhea after this horrible lunch. Highly not recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Our first day in Toronto and we came to this Restaurant, it reminded us to our San Francisco Hayes and Ashbury neighborhood, the service was really nice, food was amazing, we had the Hungarian Schnitzel, Chestnut Chicken and Green Curry Chicken and all the dishes were fantastic... will def be back..."}
{"text":"Come for a drink, avoid the food. The guys here are nice, but it seems they do so to make up for the horrible reheated food. The veggie fried rolls (menu says spring roll) definitely were thawed and microwaved, same for jalapeno poppers. At least they had Singha beer lol"}
{"text":"Hungary Thai offers an odd mix of vegetarian, Hungarian and Thai food.

Here's the deal. The food is good and service is fast. I had a chicken pad Thai that was as good as any I have had. At 13$ it was the cheapest lunch main on the menu.

The problem is that prices for lunch start around 15$, which is the end point for most meals in the market. My colleague got a meal called the Hungarian (generous portions all around), a Caesar salad and a canned drink that came to over 30$.

If you decided to share a meal, you could do it. Otherwise, prices are a bit too steep."}
{"text":"Good beer, but the Thai food could use some work. Pad Thai and fried rice weren't that good, but the mango chicken was alright."}
{"text":"I was at this eatery last summer and I haven't been on Yelp as much as I should be. But here's what opinion is. Hungary Thai? My first thought...Thai food? Kind of. 
I sat down at the table and looked at the menu. Then it hit me, the reason it was called Hungary Thai is it doesn't mean your hungry for Thai food. It's a Hungarian cuisine and Thai cuisine eatery. That was a sign that I should of got up and left but I ordered a drink already and decided to stay and give it a try. It was a while back and I'm not sure what I ordered but it was not an authentic Thai cuisine. It tasted like a home cook tried to whip something up that didn't turn out right. It left a bad taste in my mouth. I didn't finish the meal and felt ripped off. 
All I can say is never again...!!!"}
{"text":"The best Thai we've ever had. I had chic satay and husband had cashew chic. Excellent. Ordered wine and it went perfectly with our meal!  So good we would definable return!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed every bite of my meal at the. thai Hungary restaurant in Kensington market.  Hungarian cuisine is well known throughout the world and this restaurant does not disappoint. the portions are generous and everything was very tasty.  The four of us agreed that we will come back soon."}
{"text":"The highlight of this place is the atmosphere. Get yourself a seat on the patio on a sunny summer day, order a cold drink, and just take in the sights and sounds of being in the middle of Kensington Market. You can even get a decent view of the CN Tower too. That's why my first visit to this restaurant stands out to me as part of a memorable day exploring Kensington Market with my fiancee.

But of course, the food is fantastic too. We've stuck to the Thai side of things, we're big fans of the pad thai, and I also tried barbecue something-or-other just a few spots below the pad thai in the menu, which was also delicious. Service is also great, they are very friendly and attentive. Decor is a little cheesy on the inside, but not too much, just enough to give it character.

If I want a meal in the area, this is where I'll be coming!"}
{"text":"Nice patio,  great service,  great food.  Nice twist with Thai AND Hungarians options. Come from the states and i have not seem this combination before!"}
{"text":"The only restaurant I've ever seen that specializes in both Thai and Hungarian food, the aptly named \"Hungary Thai\" serves up large portions with interesting flavors, amid a pleasant, colorful, rather Bohemian ambiance. The service was also pleasant, and I loved speaking with the owner herself about how she came to own the place!"}
{"text":"This was the first time trying this place at Kensington market. I had got take out for lunch. I ordered the red curry chicken. It cost around $13.00 

I wasn't too sure what I had wanted to eat for lunch, so I decided instead of going to all the regular places that I usually go downtown I decided to try something new. My first impression of the red curry chicken was it looked like just a bunch of sauce and ingredients mixed together. I couldn't even tell there was rice until you pick and spread apart all the ingredients. I was a little turned off by how the sauce looked a bit oily. But once, I tasted the curry, it was quite delicious. What also was interesting about the curry was it was creamy, coconutty and spicy. So many things going in the sauce which made the whole meal more enjoyable to eat! 

I first thought it wouldn't be spicy, since alot of the thai places i've tried before downtown werent spicy at all (-_-)....  The appearance of the red curry chicken in the take out box just looks utterly atrocious, it looks so messy because everything is compiled together. Alot of the other places usually separate the curry with the rice but NOT this place. This just pour the veggies and curry all over the rice, so the rice is drenched with the curry. BUT i might say I sorta like that lol. Maybe to others, some may not like their rice all soaked with sauce but I personally like it. Especially with the sauce tasting pretty good, it makes eating the rice all more tasty and enjoyable. 

The only things I wish they could do better with this dish is to put larger pieces of chicken and not make it so oily. They were a bit stingy on the chicken imo. But again, i don't mean to praise the sauce but it was quite tasty. It was different, from alot of other thai places. Some places make it more watery and no kick but they place has kick and taste, and texture.  

Overall,  pretty good place, I'd come back here and try more stuff the next time. And maybe next time ill ask the owner if he's from Hungary but enjoys Thai food :)"}
{"text":"I have never written a review on Yelp before but I think this place deserves it.
I love the Hungary Thai. I have come more than 7 times and I bring all my friends. The owner even knows me. I always get the Hungary Thai combo and share it and the portions are huge and delicious. Taste is always amazing and service (when the owner is the one doing it) is really good.

The owners are hungarian but the chef worked for many years at a Thai restaurant and that's why they decided to make this combo and it sounds weird but both styles of food are delicious and together they are amazing!"}
{"text":"This place would be great, if you were from the Movie \"Dune\" and looking for \"The Spice\". 

If you're from Earth, it's Rubbish. The Basil Chicken was beyond Salty. The Pad Thai was terrible. The Server  asked us how our Meals were but turned and walked away before finishing his sentence.  $50 later,  I can honestly say: The best thing about this place were the Drinks on tap: because they weren't made there."}
{"text":"This is only a review for their drinks - pretty solid. They have a very nice patio area covered with tropical plants and a pleasant, wide umbrella for the sun.

A+ on their margaritas - strong and tangy. Didn't have the grossly thick consistency of margarita from a mix, but was a good, clear liquid. Rimmed with salt for some savory tingles on the tongue. I could definitely taste the tequila, which is exactly how I liked it. No ice, served cold in a frosty metal margarita cup. Awesome.

Mojito was strong too - not as good as the margarita but it had a great minty vibe to it.

Awesome patio for grabbing some drinks. 

Food seems pretty good too - everyone around me was ordering and it definitely smelled awesome. Weird combination of Hungarian and Thai food, but hey, whatever works."}
{"text":"I came by this bizarre combination on a saturday afternoon. I was really looking for something lighter, but the \"hungarian thai\" got me. 

You must be aware that the patio is the only decent place to be seated, otherwise you will spent the rest of your days smelling like deep fried rolls. The whole place is deep fried. This annoyed me a lot. 

But the food was really great. I ordered a mango salad for starter and it was awesome. Lots of spices and subtle flavours, a good combination of vegetables. Very interesting salad. 

Then came the main course - the shrimp barbecue. Oh boy, I really should have asked for something lighter, but this is delicious. Lots of shrimps pan fried with onion, bell pepper and, obviously, tons of spices, form a delicious \"thai barbecue sauce\", and this is served over jasmine rice. I'm sure you want it right away. They have the chicken version, but I'm always for shrimp. 

I ate like an ogre, because the food was really great. Now I have to go back and try the hungarian treats. But from their patio, otherwise I may be confused with a deep fried shrimp."}
{"text":"Spotted this place a few weeks ago.  Actually I've seen it before, but it didnt catch my attention until recently.  Decided to go there last night with a friend who has just been given a fairly restricted nutrition/dietary plan to follow. 

After considering the options, we ordered the Thai/Hungarian combo.  Spring rolls, a cabbage roll, schnitzel and chicken pad thai.   $40 for 2.    The Thai portions were too spicy for my friend and a bit underspiced for me.   I added a little chili sauce to the pad thai and it was very good then (though á lot of food so my partner finished it for breakfast today).   Cruciferous veggies are off my friend's permitted foods list so I pulled the pork-rice ball innards out of the cabbage roll for her - she really enjoyed that.  I had the sauerkraut and cabbage from the cabbage roll bowl - very very tasty.  I'd definitely order another one of those monster pork balls with cabbage and sweetish sauerkraut.  I had a small section of the schnitzel - very well prepared and tasty.  My friend really enjoyed the schnitzel -had about half and took the balance home for her husband along with the second spring roll. 

One woman in the kitchen, a fella doing the hosting/serving duties with a couple of his  Hungarian pals there to keep him company when he sat down.   The gents were singing along to the Hungarian pop songs competing with CP24.   

We were there fairly early (4:30 p.m. Saturday) as we were on our way to an evening out - surprisingly busy through the entire time we were there. 

... and is usual in my reviews ... the washrooms .... downstairs ... somewhat wonky stairs ... very clean 

Not a spectacular meal - but a good meal in a pleasant setting.  We're planning to go back to try goulash soup and paprikash."}
{"text":"Decent-tasting food (I got chicken pad Thai, $12) but the dishes aren't very clean. My water glass smelled like beer and the plate was dirty. I am concerned about the cleanliness of the kitchen but otherwise it was ok. I doubt I'd be back. I've had better quality, comparably-priced Thai at cleaner restaurants."}
{"text":"really disappointed. expected better thai cuisine, however it was a choice between this and the mexican restaurant next door, we selected this one, and boy did we make a big mistake.  i ordered shrimp fried rice, my sister ordered shrimp and chicken fried rice.  i received her plate and she received mine.  the shrimp/chicken fried rice was full of black pepper, tasted more like stewed chicken and rice.  my sister said her rice was ok, but not chinese based.  our friend said her food was ok, except it was dry and lacking chinese thai flavoring.  the spring rolls were ok.  we ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was extremely light in flavor, and mild in taste.  wouldn't go back again, and can't recommend it"}
{"text":"So bad. When you order an ice tea for $2.5, you are given a can of nestea. The cabbage rolls are so greasy. Together with the dingy furniture and shabby decor, I was seriously worried about food poisoning. The service was pretty bad too."}
{"text":"Horrible.  The restaurant was very tiny.  Good thing we were the only customers, while the restaurant next door looked packed.  That was probably a sign.  Our server had a cold, which was totally unacceptable, we just hoped she didn't sneeze on or touch our food.  Super expensive, about $15 for an entree.  Bad food. Didn't taste thai at all.  Rice had a funny smell.  I would not recommend this place even if they lowered their prices."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be great with such a creative name. However, the service was disappointing, and the server was slow to get menu order, drink order, etc. While the place was not full that afternoon, we were seated in a cramped corner area. The food itself was decent, but not amazing. We did the Thai side of things, so maybe the Hungary inspired meals would be better."}
{"text":"Nice patio, not too busy, friendly waiter! I did not like the pad Thai because it was too sweet. Maybe the Ohio version of pad Thai is different, lol? Not sure. But, husband got mango chicken and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"What the heck! Ordered pad Thai from this place as it was the daily special! Worst pad Thai both of us have ever had. Tiny microwaved shrimps, and it seemed as though they used tomato sauce. not joking. Surreally bad food, pls avoid"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend a couple of nights ago after an art performance in the area. The service was great and my vegetarian lemongrass curry was delicious and filling. They are slightly on the expensive side, but the food and service were excellent and it was well worth the time. I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most interesting fusion places I've seen in Toronto. There's the classic Thai menu, but also a full array of Hungarian options. 

But don't worry, each dish isn't a mix of Hungarian style Thai food, or Thai style hungarian food (whatever that is). It's just two separate sides of the menu. 

I'm a sucker for the chicken pad thai here, with a little bit of hot sauce, I just can't resist! Hungary Thai was about a 3 minute walk from my old place so it was my usual take-out spot after a long day of studying.

Once in a while they have a guy come in with his keyboard and play some tunes. It is very, very random, but definitely makes for a unique experience. It's a bit hard to explain, you'll have to check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Really cool concept restaurant, but the execution is a little spotty.  I ordered the chicken fried rice, which was good, but not amazing.  It was a bit dry.  The portion was quite big and I could have eaten the rest for another meal.  My mom had the Goulash and she was quite impressed.  I had never tasted it before, even though my family is Hungarian, but I am definitely a fan now!  I'd say the Hungarian food definitely outweighs the Thai food in quality and the Thai food outweighs the Hungarian food in quantity.  At least from what I experienced. 

The service was ok at first.  The woman working brought my cousin ice cream in a ladybug patterned glass, which she loved.  When we were finished however, we couldn't find her for fifteen minutes and finally had to go outside and ask another woman how we were supposed to pay.  She rung us up, but we nearly dined and ditched because the employees pretty much disappeared.  Weird."}
{"text":"Meh.

I came here because I had dinner plans with my cousin. If I had it my way I would have gone somewhere with higher reviews and the fact that it's Thai and Hungarian kind of weirded me out TBH! Interesting concept I guess!

I had the coconut shrimp to start and the cashew chicken as my meal. My cousin got the same entrée. She asked for them to remove any onions or mushrooms. They said they'd do their best to get it out of the frozen mix. Kind of awkward that they admitted their veggies aren't fresh but oh well.

Both my things were good, the cashew chicken was a little saucy but good nonetheless.

The staff were very nice too."}
