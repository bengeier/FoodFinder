{"text":"I just got home from the BEST lunch at workshop. A friend suggested it for a lunch catch up and wow, am I ever impressed! It was quite busy when we arrived but with a really fun, upbeat ambiance from the downtown lunch crowd. We were seated quickly and our very attentive server Brendan was right there to fill us in on the features for the day. Deciding what to have was the hardest part!!! Creative dishes, fun fusions and lots of local products featured on both the food and drink menus. My burger  was the bomb. As soon as it arrived the scent of smoked cheese wafted up and damn did it deliver! The soup of the day, potato goddess goodness with a dash of heaven was so on point I'm going to be dreaming of it until I convince someone to share that recipe with me. Oh and the bacon on the burger? CRISPY! Hel-lo! Nothing grinds my gears worse than bacon as flabby and tough as old aunt Mable's backside, but this bacon! Oh! Perfection..see ya later Mable, that sh*t is for Denny's. This was hands down one of the tastiest, most enjoyable lunches I've had with undoubtedly the best service I've had in a long time in Calgary. Thanks for making my birthday a great time! I can't wait to bring my husband back and try even more of your wicked delicious food!"}
{"text":"Nice food, tasty and fresh but pretty expensive.
If you are for gourmet food this the place! If you are really hungry and looking for a quick meal you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service and food is superb.  We got their tasting menu which changes daily.  The bartender also makes a nice custom cocktail.  Very reasonably priced for the quality, will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"They have a great variety of menu items especially great if you're feeling a little peckish or wanting tapas style!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in downtown Calgary....by far!!

Everything was delicious.

Actually one of the best restaurants I've ever been too. Period. And I am a foodie."}
{"text":"Very innovative and delicious food. The menu and how your order is different and cool, there are good 3 and 5 course options to try a good variety of amazing food.

The ambiance is cool too. Nothing pretentious, a pretty casual atmosphere with cool industrial decor.  

I would grant a full 5 stars, however, it is a little on the pricey side of things, so great before seeing a show once in a while at the Grand, but not a weekly hangout."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Workshop and we came because of all of the great reviews, which we TOTALLY AGREE with!

From the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable.  The hostess made us feel welcome immediately and we were seated just as quickly.  Our waitress was so wonderful.  She was just attentive enough.  She knew when to come over and also when to let us enjoy the meal.

I loved the maple cinnamon drink!  We also had the 3 course improv meal and it was so nice to be surprised to see what was coming up next.  Each dish was prepared exquisitely and presented well.  We were very happy with everything throughout and can't wait to drop by again!"}
{"text":"Checked out Workshop. Amazing. They are located in the Grand theatre, so the place is classic yet comfortable. The menu has been created by chef Kenny Kaechele, an incredibly talented man. We tried the three course dinner. The amuse was a tenderloin that was to die for. Following that was a spring salmon belly and scallop, then a rib eye that was cooked perfectly. A lemon tart for dessert finished the night off perfectly. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The menu is ever changing and dynamic! Certainly a culinary experience worth having! Go for the 3 or 5 course meal and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Got a reservation on a Saturday for a big group.
I'm always a little leery of having one server for many people, but she was fantastic. She had great recommendations and was very knowledgable and attentive.
Between the entire group, we tried a ton of drinks and menu items.
I won't go through them all, and I was told the choices constantly change, so I'll just say, it was all delicious.
The chef seemed to really enjoy being creative with his dishes.
Workshop is on the pricy side, so I'd recommend it for a nice date night or celebratory dinner."}
{"text":"I like Workshop. A respite from the common Calgary trend lately, Workshop throws a lot of layers of flavor into meat and starch dishes without relying on Asian seasoning. Let's face it: anything with fish sauce or tamarind tastes good.

We came for the 3 course lunch, and as others have noted, you do feel like you're dining rather than just scarfing down something quickly. A fun selection of tea/herb/fruit infused homemade sodas adds to this even if you aren't having alcohol. The starter chowder was fresh and had a nice not-too-thick consistency. Being from the Maritimes, super creamy chowder doesn't seem right.

The Arctic char was nicely cooked, and served with a lightly sautéed cauliflower based veggie mix that was seasoned with North African inspiration. My wife's short rib had the perfect texture, and a great brown sauce with deep meaty flavor. The brownie and blondie desserts were okay, but the least inspired part of the meal.

The decor and atmosphere is a bit hard to peg down in one word...it's in the foyer of a heritage theater, with an open kitchen, long chesterfield-like benches, and a large dangling array of old chains and cogs. Our server was pretty green, but my impression is that overall the staff is very professional. If you're looking for a breath of fresh air in the Calgary fine dining scene, this is it."}
{"text":"The highlights:
Homemade sodas with names like saspirilla root beer and honey lavender lemonade (I had both)
A 3-course + drink lunch deal for $25
A service culture that interacts beautifully with ALL the guests
A unique setting in what seems to be the old foyer of the theatre

This restaurant definitely scores points for cool. 

The 3 course lunch menu was a choice of soup or salad, followed by a fish or braise dish and finished with a brownie or fruit. I chose the soup, fish and brownie. 

Don't you just hate it when a soup is supposed to have some protein and you need a microscope to actually find it in the soup? Not this soup! The chunks of meat in this baby were plentiful and delightful. I'm not a soup fan but I cleaned my bowl. Even tilted it to the side to get those last few drops. Emily Post would have been appalled!

My fish dish was perfectly done too and the brownie?! Well, it takes a lot of unskillness to mess up a brownie  and chef Kenny and his team got skills so....

Yep, I feel like for this to be a really balanced review I must throw a little negative in here. Really racking my brain for something and the best I can come up with is.... ummm.... errr.... I'll get back to y'all in a bit."}
{"text":"Pausing in Calgary between mountain trips and stopped in for dinner.  Loved the space and ambiance. Servers were attentive and very nice. I sat up at the bar right in front of the kitchen and it was very cool to watch them all in action. They were also nice to do half orders so I could try more things. I had the gnocchi, crispy brussels sprouts and the scallop small plate.  All were great and so were the cocktails (forgot the name but my fav of the 2 I had was mixed with ice tea, grand marnier  and bourbon I believe...)"}
{"text":"Well we went based on the reviews. We had the 3 course just to see how much we get for what we were paying for. We can always come back if it panned out. We eat out a lot just to try different dishes so our taste buds are not limited so my opinion is based on taste quality and price. I don't remember the exact name of the dished we tried but here goes. 
The first thing we tasted was shrimp served in a spoon with garnish that was pretty good. The second dish we had was pork cheeks and that was tasty. The main course was a sirloin dish on vegetables. that was a let down hoping it was going to be as good as the first 2. The vegetables were ok , the meat was chewy on a couple of bites and portion was a teaser size. I've had a lot better cut and larger portions for less money. I know the price of beef has gone up but for 2 servings of sirloin at about 4 oz. each is ridiculous. This reminded me of the Cheetos commercial.
 The desert was a cake with chocolate mouse was ok. Nothing to write home about. I tried the Potato Gnocchi with the pickled turnip. I tasted the pickled turnip more than anything else. I tried the potato with just the sauce and I found it bland and salty. 
The add on wine with the meal was way over priced for what you get. For $25.00 for 6 - 7 oz. of wine ???  We should of asked what we get for $25.00 ,I guess
The service was excellent. The décor was interesting and very clean. The steel chairs was very uncomfortable. My butt was sore and my leg went to sleep before we finished dinner. You would think that if a place was to trying to impress customers they would try and make them more comfortable at least. There was only one other restaurant that we've come across with this issue.
For the 2 of us it cost $150.00 plus tip for this and I say go somewhere else and get a better deal and just as good if not better. Their concept of offering different courses is interesting and good for some people but after this , I would prefer to chose off the menu somewhere else.
Their dollar rating is under rated according to what you get, it's more like a $$$ to a $$$$ rather than a $$.
Cost does not bother me ,but over paying for quality and taste and quantity does."}
{"text":"I was part of a lunch group of 9, where most but not all of us could afford to be a little late returning to work.  I found the menu online and was looking forward to an interesting lunch.  Even tweeted about it and was looking forward to tweeting further after the lunch.  

Ambience is good.  Food turned out to be good.  But service?  After taking our order, things seemed to really slow down.  And our server wouldn't even meet our eyes.  A visit to the table would have made a lot of difference.  Workshop is supposed to 'care about your time at lunch'.  Disappointing to say the least.  One of our party had to take her meal 'to go'."}
{"text":"There was no debating whether or not Workshop Kitchen + Culture deserves five stars or not, this place amazed me from the minute I walked in the door. 
I love that they've left some of the Showcase Grand Theater architectural element exposed and as part of the design. The seating is comfortable and despite having an open kitchen I was able to easily hear both the waiter and my dining companion.
The food is both flavourful and well prepared. The dishes are very unique and imaginative and the cocktail menu also reflects that.
Though I can guarantee you will want everything on the menu, make sure you leave room for dessert because it is stunning!

Workshop Kitchen + Culture is meant to be fully open on Monday, September 22."}
{"text":"The staff were extremely friendly the moment I stepped inside and the decor was beautiful. However, the food was on the pricier side. The total for just myself was over $55 after tips, though it was pretty worthwhile. My drink (air bud) was probably overpriced at $13, and my pork belly was $32. I sat by the kitchen area and watched the chefs prepare my meal and I was in awe. They were precise about every detail. The flavours on the pork belly were to die for and the drink was pretty good too, but not $13 good (of course the waitress recommended the most expensive drink). After my meal and drink, the waitress came with a dessert plate and said it was a gift from the chef and it was delicious. I probably won't return anytime soon because of the price, but it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Dinner for four on a Saturday night. We got the 5 course chef's plate with wine pairings. Truly great locally inspired and sophisticated plates. The wine/cocktail pairings were truly delicious. The service by Brennan the wine director was equally entertaining and educational. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my first review ever here.  
I travel for a living and you could put this place in any city in the world and it would be a hit.  

Great service and great food at a reasonable price. 

If you come to Calgary make sure to visit for dinner"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious.  The service is great and the ambiance is great.  The only improvement I'd suggest to replace the sofa seats, they are way to low.  Otherwise it's one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!! We did the 5 course improv dinner here on thursday and are so glad we did!! We had an amazing server that took great care of us. If you're doing the 5 course improv be sure to not plan anything else and enjoy your time. There wasn't a single dish I didn't love! They keep it a surprise too and just tell you the proteins. 
It's a small little restaurant so be sure to make resos just in case!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience!  Great food, great atmosphere and fantastic service!  We took our 4 kids and ordered 3 sharing plates with appies (Cauliflower is amazing!) and sides (Brussel sprouts outstanding!). Wine was also great. Our waiter (Brendan) was so accommodating and thoughtful (special fun drinks for the kids and picked the wine based on our likes). Great way to do dinner and show (The Grand is a great theatre to watch live theatre). We would go back in a heartbeat (and will!)."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst value and most disappointing meal we have had in Calgary, and we have lived here all our lives.  We paid top dollar and then some for a chef's choice, and it was awful, except for the tiny appetizers.  The table top was dirty and sticky, the chairs were brutally uncomfortable, and while the staff was friendly, the waitress blew it.  When my wife complained that her glass of wine was dirty, with a lump of something on the glass, she took the drink away and returned with the same glass of wine which they had tried to scrape the lump off of, but had not.  If my wife had told me, I would have called a manager over, but she only mentioned it on the way home.  
We were served a dish that they said was duck, but it was as tender as an old piece of chuck, and tasted more like chuck than duck as well.
The price for this disaster was excessive and nothing about the meal nor the experience was enjoyable, other than the company that we were with.  This restaurant may be trendy, but none of the six of us would suggest it is worth a try."}
{"text":"When someone told me they redid the space at the Grand Theatre into a restaurant, I couldn't wait to see how they did it.

How would I describe the décor? Hmmmm, industrial chic? Long bench style tables with metal stools with rustic lighting.

Immediately drawn to the pork belly appie (which came with jimaca), I figured I'd be a bit healthier and get the baby gem salmon salad (which also came a poached egg drizzled with a hazelnut mustard dressing) for my main. I'm glad I got both, although the salad was quite delicious (the crunchy honey roasted hazelnuts were a nice touch), the portions were quite small and I definitely wouldn't have been full off just my entrée. 

I've only been to Workshop that one and only time (it's across downtown from where I work), I wouldn't be opposed to going back."}
{"text":"Great food, cool atmosphere. I came here with 5 friends on a Friday night.

It was a little confusing to know where to go to be seated. The hostess station isn't obvious and if she isn't there, it really isn't obvious. But I figured it out.

They have a great selection of drinks - I ordered a pinot noir to start. The fantastic server informed me the wine list is going through a change but the new pinot noir is actually cheaper. Bonus. Except it turned out it wasn't, it was more expensive - so in the end she comped the difference. Which was classy.

Lots of interesting menu choices. This is the one area where they lose the star for me though. I get sharing stuff is a thing right now. But if you go to a restaurant as a single person, with other couples who are sharing with their partners, and the menu has only sharing options, you are kinda stuck. I ended up ordering two share plates for me to share with myself, not sure if it would be too much food or not. It worked out in the end (the beet salad is great as was the polenta with shrimp) but their lack of one or two entree type items made me feel a bit awkward.

That said, everyone's food looked and tasted great. My friend has the beef tartar and said it was the best she had ever had. The gnocchi seemed popular too as was the share-chicken. Of note, two of the guys at the table had wanted steak but it was way overpriced for the size (4oz) so they opted for something else.

I'm curious to try the lunch as it seems like that's better suited for non-sharers. All in all its a nice spot with great food and superb service."}
{"text":"I went in with a group of 10 friends last night and I think we all had no set expectations of Workshop but we were all pleasantly surprised how wonderful the meal and overall experience ended up being.    I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I usually do not recommend going out for dinner on New Years Eve........however 4 of us found ourselves making reservations for the 8 pm , 5 course dinner seating at Workshop Kitchen + Culture.
What a great decision.......The space was large but very well laid out , comfortable not cavernous.     The 5 course dinner offered just enough options so that everyone had no problems making choices to tailor their dining adventure. We opted out of the paired wines and went with a fabulous white wine suggested by Colby......our waitress and dinner guide. Colby was terrific. I highly recommend visiting Workshop........great dining in a comfortable and quiet space........imagine. ..great food without having to yell at your friends across the table."}
{"text":"Their lunch menu is pretty good but the dinner was a bit of disappointment.  I tried the steak and steelhead fish for dinner - both mediocre tasting and absolutely NOT worth the price.

For the lunch, on the other hand, they had a better variety of selections and prices were more moderate. 

I may go there for an occasional lunch as it's fairly close to where I work but I definitely won't go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a business trip to Calgary. Very cool vibe within a theater. Chose the \"improv\" meal which delivered 3 surprise courses of chef chosen seasonal dishes. The starter salad with greens, prosciutto, radish, hazelnut, blue cheese, and oranges was great. The entree was a duck breast with asparagus, carrots, beats, and an amazing aus ju and garlic purée. Dessert was an angel food cake with berries and custard. Overall the meal was fantastic and a really fun surprise menu concept!"}
{"text":"Brought my wife in on a whim over a surprise 40th birthday trip to Calgary from Portland Oregon for dinner, based on reviews from Yelp.  We sat down and chose the 5-course with pairings, which took the pressure of deciding on something from the menu off.  Over the next two hours, we were treated with incredible service, and a continual intense culinary onslaught on our senses.  It was easily the best dining experience we have had in over a decade, if not longer.  The staff was incredible, and even signed and wrote memos on a card for my wife for sharing our experience at their establishment.  Absolutely one of the most memorable points of our trip.  If you are ever in Calgary, this is the place!"}
{"text":"My BF and I had a wonderful meal here as part of the March 2017 #BigTasteYYC.
When I called earlier in the day, the hostess managed to squeeze us in even though the reservations were full up for the night.  And I am so glad she did.

We enjoyed an excellent bottle of Reisling from a winery we had actually visited in Germany--Basserman-Jordan.  What a delight to find it on the menu! Service was friendly and attentive but not overbearing. The meal was excellent--we tried both of the options offered in each course. The beef carpaccio starter was a fabulous combination of textures and flavors.  The fish in the second course was delicate and gorgeously presented. Beside it, we tried the ribeye and oh my was it yummy and a perfect medium rare. Desserts were also delightful. 

Truly a marvelous experience, the evening ended with our server giving us a card signed by all the staff wishing my boyfriend well in his new office here in Calgary.  So thoughtful and a really personal touch to finish off the night.

I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has a very good tasting menu. The food was well prepared and verybtasty. Eveeytjing had the right balance of spices and flqvour. I definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"Don't go here.... without a reservation that is. The food is amazing and the servers are awesome. It does seem like a odd location, but the food is well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Sat at the kitchen counter. Went with the improv. Food was phenomenal and the chefs and staff were great. Loved watching the chefs prepare all the dishes. My favorite was the sweet and sour pork cheeks."}
{"text":"Wow!  What amazing flavors and informed server (Jennifer)!  We U.S. foodies shared the Salt Island mussels.  They were huge and we couldn't resist trying coconut curry mussels...yum!  He had the very rare, tender lamb wrapped in pancetta and I had the beef tartar.  Both had extra-ordinary flavors and textures.  

Numerous craft beers and ciders ( one with a zesty ginger aroma and taste) in addition to wine and cocktails

Sure wish we had this restaurant in St Louis."}
{"text":"It's unfair that this place should be found on our vacation and not in our own backyard. Lunch there was ridiculously tasty. I had the braise special for the day, and it was fall-apart-with-a-spoon tender, dressed with a delicious au jus and refried black beans. My wife had the daily fish, and it was flaky and flavorful. The berries and brownie were of course amazing. They had a great bar selection too, and the rum cocktail I had was excellently prepared.  The service was attentive, and she was even able to give us tips for our vacation in Banff. The parking was a little difficult, but we were able to get one of the lots down the street and walk without much trouble. Would definitely come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I've reviewed Workshop on every site I could, and I can't believe I forgot to review it here!

Simply the best meal we have EVER had.  In Calgary, or anywhere.  I have never been this enthusiastic to share a dining experience before.

Two bites into dinner, my husband informed me that this is where we will be eating for our anniversary dinner, his birthday dinner, and whatever special event we can think of.  Any excuse to come back!  No convincing needed here!

Chef Kenny came by our table a couple times to ask us how our meal was and to give us a dessert suggestion.  I love that he actually cares about what his guests think and takes the time to come over and say hi.  Great guy! 

The service was top notch, food was to die for, cozy atmosphere, and absolutely worth the price.  

I wish I could keep Workshop a secret.  Or that Chef Kenny would be our private chef for the rest of our lives..."}
{"text":"The space is lovely and made for a great atmosphere for dinner. Not too dark and not too noisy so you can really enjoy the company you are with. Happy to see that they could cater to a big group of over 10 ppl. The service was excellent! Our waitress took the time to explain how the menu works and was very knowledgable about each dish, the ingredients and how each dish is prepared. The menu is designed to share which is a common theme now with most restaurants in the city. Portions were generous and the food delectable! Definitely enjoyed my first visit at Workshop and already looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. I met a girlfriend here at 11:45 hoping to grab an early lunch. By 12:25 our orders - a salad and the fish, both off the specials menu - still hadn't arrived. No server came back to refill our waters, either. Ultimately, after 45 minutes of waiting, we suspected our orders had been missed. She finally came back and explained that the kitchen was backed up with two large groups and that's why we were still waiting. Since we had meetings at 1pm to get to, we asked to have the lunches wrapped up. Cue the broken debit machine - another 10 minute wait to be able to pay for a lunch. I'm finally having my salad, which is good, but I feel like we really earned it. I doubt that we will go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Wonderful staff. I was hesitant when entering the dark building and seeing the restaraunt at the back. It was such a pretty day with so many outdoor dining options. I'd come back here every day. The menu changes daily. Everything is fresh. Wonderful."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place after walking by many times.  Had been to the venue before when it was UBU and Velvet.  Really like the direction Workshop has gone with the decor  and layout.  Very industrial chic.  Greeted and seated straight away while we awaited our dining companions.  Had a look at the menu online which was completely different to what we received.  Was really looking forward to trying the beef tartare that everyone raved about.  So to start was a bit disappointed.  After our guests joined us we debated about trying their tasting menu and opted to try the 5course.  Our server was extremely accommodating to our discerning tastes and even shared what the surprise main protein was, as one of our guests was not a pork fan.  Our server was able to accommodate this request as well as providing suitable alternatives in a timely fashion when one of our guests was unable to stomach the tartare.  The tartare was excellent, but was surprised by the portion size.  It was quite large and filling with a full size 60degree egg on top.  Decadent but could be half the size with a touch more acidity.  The amuse buse was also tasty but missing salt or a touch of heat.  The second course was hamachi which was again excellent and well balanced.   Only comment ~ there were three raw dishes ~ it might be wise to forewarn diners about this should they choose the tasting menu, and are unable to eat raw.  The main was pork.  Was a bit disappointing especially after we saw what the alternative non-pork dish was - the amazing charcoal steak!!  Wish we had that instead.  The pork was tender but slightly more pink than preferred for pork.  Loved the paired veggies and sun chokes to change things up!  The cheese toast take on French onion soup was quite tasty but again large in size.  Could have been half the size and presented more stylishly.  The dessert was hands down the best course.  It was an amazing cornbread done to the nines.  Well balanced richness with acidity.  Overall dining experience was not too bad but I guess we are tough to impress.  Look forward to hearing how this place does.  They were busy with many more folks just arriving around 9pm.  Would recommend but might just try a few items to share off the regular menu especially the steak!"}
{"text":"Relaxed, interesting atmosphere and friendly, professional service make for an enjoyable evening...but most importantly, the food is pretty much the best in the city.  Creative, flavourful, and just so yummy.  The gnocchi and brussels sprouts are the best we have had anywhere!"}
{"text":"There comes a time when you dine at a restaurant and it becomes the most satisfying experience you've had in years. Among the Labor Day holiday shenanigans my friend and I planned, Workshop was a spontaneous choice, given our tardiness at a previous reservation (due to our thorough exploration of the city). But as always with spontaneity, that's when you come across hidden gems. The place is easily recognizable with its old theatrical sign and wooden stand-up sign, paired with the Theatre Junction Grand inside the historic Grand Theatre building. Would definitely like to return for more delicious food and to catch a show at the theatre.

We just walked in and decided to sit at the bar seats surrounding the open kitchen. Best decision I've made in a while. The chefs were really friendly, and props to Kenny and the crew for cooking delicious dishes with good cuts of meat and fresh produce. I HIGHLY recommend going for either the three-course or five-course impromptu menu. It's very satisfying watching the chefs work their magic and put together delicious dishes that aren't on the menu, with fresh ingredients that meld in your mouth! 

My friend and I went for the three-course to share, and enjoyed every bite! (Well, I admit I had most of it, but I regret nothing! hah!)

- First on the line was an amuse-bouche: a crustini topped with yuzu-dressed salmon. A fresh, savory bite to wet the palate for the glory to come!

- First course was a salmon and veal dish with a cauliflower falafel. The salmon was nicely done and the skin was crisped to perfection. The veal was cooked perfectly and complemented the lighter flavor/textures of the fish.

- Next up came a veal and potato jenga blocks with asparagus and ratatouille. More veal is never a bad thing. The dish was definitely hearty, but well balanced with meat, carbs, and vegetables. Their jenga blocks were an ingenious way to break the monotony of serving meat with fries, potato wedges, mash, and other more traditional starchy goodness. Layering potato slices into a mille-feuille, and then slicing them into jenga blocks gave the potato enough crisp yet retained enough moisture within each piece. The little jewel box-sized ratatouille was another solid layer of flavor in the dish. The chefs joked I'd be in trouble with this one... but I devoured the dish like no other!

- New player as entered the game! Towards the beginning of the night, my friend was amazed by dish the chefs were whipping up: a cast-iron mini-plate of cheese, bacon jelly, and walnuts served with sliced crustini. She was so intrigued that as the night progressed Kenny turns over and remarks - don't worry, I'll make you one to try. Hence the curve-ball to surprise our palates with a symphony of savoriness and sweetness. The hot plate kept the cheese from solidifying, and the bacon jelly was to die for! 

- The 'official' third course was a bread-pudding cake with a chocolate truffle, maple and walnuts. Feel like my memory is botching this dish, but it was a dessert that should be heavy after a plethora of food, but the most notable aspect was that it wasn't. The cake had a good density to fill the mouth with a hefty mouthful.

Props to Workshop for the amazing dinner and hospitality! A sublime experience, with a yelp review that only scratches the surface. If you ever find yourself in Calgary, I cannot more highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to the Workshop with a group of 10 last night and I have to say this place was amazing. One of the 10 was celiac and I am a vegetarian and it was no issue what so ever. I had the bread and two of the side dishes and was beyond completely full. The \"side\" gnocchi was indeed a dish in it self and believe me it was too die for. The Brussel sprouts were amazing too. Most of the crowd had the $50 3 course tasting and all seemed very pleased. Was it cheap no.... But I had two drinks (one was a gin drink with homemade soda -delish- and my three item and total including tip was about $60 which I felt was definitely worth it for what you got. Our waiter was amazing, seriously top notch. Fun, friendly, sincere and accommodating. I am not from Calgary and was just here for the night with work but for sure the next time I'm in town I'll go back. Definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Service and food is superb.  We got their tasting menu which changes daily.  The bartender also makes a nice custom cocktail.  Very reasonably priced for the quality, will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I walked in for lunch, and I ordered a cup of soup with a salad. They did have a lunch special for $25, but I wasn't hungry enough for all of that food. I sat at the counter, right by the chefs. Everyone was really friendly towards me (probably because I was by myself). The chef offered to give me a free dessert, and I should have said yes! It looked great! I would give this place a 5, but I thought the prices were high. I appreciate that they have lunch specials (the $25 meal deal), but I would like to see them have more specials, like a soup and half sandwich combo. You won't be disappointed with the food, so it's worth coming by. The prices are my only complaint."}
{"text":"Wow! What an awesome surprise. Been there once, and it was great! Had the seven course table d'hote. Best meal that we've had since La Dolce Vita (which unfortunately is now closed). Whenever I see this offered (which is rare) I usually order it. Especially when it's different each day, depending what the chef has fresh. We started off with a Parmesan Cannoli with whipped herb boursin. This was delicious. Followed by Ahi Tuna Tiradito - amazing! Then a short rib Pappardelle with pine nuts, roasted tomatoes and manchego. Delicious! A carrot sorbet with ginger rooibos tea poured over it. Different for a sorbet refresher - never had a tea of any kind served with it. A tenderloin followed, which was as good as any (except La Dolce Vita). Now we're full. Then we were served with a warm D'Appalache cheese dish. Very tasty. The dessert was a chocolate pot de creme.  Nice. Overall: imaginative dishes - I die for new taste experiences that are well made. This meal was beyond my wildest expectations! Such an amazing evening. 
The service was impeccable. The only down side is the ambiance. Room is very industrial looking. Wherein lies my surprise. Wasn't expecting a five star experience with the looks of the place."}
{"text":"Food was quite flavorful.  Not quite four stars but more 3 1/2 stars.  Excellent service.  Very unique decor... although I would have preferred unrip seats as it was a uncomfortable wearing a skirt sitting in rip seats."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to check out again and again. Chef Kenny basically puts out a different tasting menu everyday, 3 courses or 5 courses as well as having a menu you can pick dishes from. I was truly impressed by the menu put out for the Finale Dinner of Big Taste YYC 2018. It consisted of Salmon Belly Tartare, Scallop and Duck Confit Crepinette, Lamb Noisette and Shoulder, Fior di Latte Tempura, Earl Grey Chocolate Pot de Creme. The only dish that was a little disappointing for me was the Tempura as the batter was hard as a rock. My companions found it delicious so I must have had a piece that was left in the fryer too long but otherwise the food was impressive, not just for the flavours but the texture of each dish. I often find that texture is a neglected element but not so here at Workshop. The prices seem steep but love and care goes into each dish and every element of a dish has been carefully considered  and put together e.g. The salmon tartare in a decadent leek soubise, the sauce alone was to die for and something that makes you wish you could lick your plate and the puffed quinoa added a nice crunch that just added an element of surprise. My favourite was the lamb Noisette and Shoulder. It's great food when each item leaves you wanting more but at the end of the meal you feel just satisfyingly full. Workshop is in the old Grand Theatre downtown so parking is as downtown parking is. Ambiance was pleasant and the service great, unobtrusive when necessary and prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place to go for an hour long lunch during the work week. Their Lougheed Lunch includes an appetizer soup or salad, main dish which is a braise or fish feature and dessert. They used to include a pop/lemonade drink and have since removed that, which is unfortunate. Their Lavender lemonade was quite good and not overly perfume-y. Overall a good one hour ~$20 lunch for the work week!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. I went with some colleagues on a recommendation and was not disappointed.

Had the bison which was cooked to perfection. Definitely get the Brussels sprouts. Sooo good."}
{"text":"We went to Workshop for the first time before a performance at Theater Grand and were very impressed.  The service was over the top good.  Our waiter wanted to ensure I had the right wine for my meal and insisted that I choose from 3 samples.  Then when we were getting ready to leave to get to the theater he was adamant that he put our leftovers away for us in the refrigerator for us to pick up after the performance.  He was all in.  The food was excellent, the wines by the glass were diverse and very good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Got the 3 course chef's testing dinner, and every single thing that came out of that kitchen was fantastic. Service and atmosphere was also good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  We had the oku and mushrooms for and appetizer.  Steal head trout and sablefish for dinner - and gnocchi and Brussels for sides.  All were great."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible meal. I'd highly recommend the improv menu. You will not be disappointed.  The pork loin appetizer was a stand out favorite for me, but returning else came in class behind.  Our server, Bobby, was also fantastic"}
{"text":"#Improv menu is a treat. I love ordering off the menu as well. Chef and staff are super friendly. Would highly recommend the delicious cuisine."}
{"text":"Great lunch special that provides great value, good options, and some variety if you go back a few different times. The chef is great and very passionate about what he is doing and the quality of the food he is putting out. The only reason I removed a star is that I have been a few times over the years and I feel the quality of the lunch menu has decreased a bit over the years, it was absolutely amazing when I first went and now I would say that it is more along the lines of really good. I've also tried to go on the weekend for dinner a few times and they have been unable to make reservations for groups so we have had to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Workshop is a great restaurant downtown Calgary. Their menu is seasonal and always changing. Chef Kenny always seems to push himself to be creative and to keep raising the bar, luckily for us customers he continues to put out great food. 

I love the atmosphere of the restaurant when you go in. They said share a building with a theater. The design is really open so you are able to see what the kitchen is doing at all times and you're able to see just how well that kitchen works together and they're beautiful plating. The Decour is modern and fun environment is great and every time that I go you can always hear a good buzz of people enjoying themselves and this restaurant.


If your looking for a meal that will leave a great impression the chefs menu has always been a big hit. 

The beef tartare is good. 

The Lamb Orecchiette is great. 

Black Apron Ribeye is terrific. 

Treat yourself to Workshop Kitchen + Culture"}
{"text":"After visiting the Glenbow and walking most of Stephens Street, which seemed like one long high-prices sports bar, I yelped Workshop kitchen just around the corner. We had just had two days of the Stampede's mostly dubious food fare and I was ready for something more quality that didn't alienate my partner. Turns out the Workshop was it. In order to avoid making individual dish decisions, we went with the 3 course meal choice and I had a glass of wine. This was not the $$ option indicated on yelp, I warn you. It was on the pricey side. However, between our server's Jennifer's astute and attentive service and the outstanding fare, this small/plate/taster's menu-style restaurant in a historic theater building was just what I needed after the previous two days of maximum yeehaw. It was a slow night and Jennifer lavished her attentions on with friendly and informative service the entire time. I cannot begin to describe the selections, chosen and created for us (with preference information-for example my partner does not like certain things and therefore our dishes avoided those), but it was a series of lovely to behold and delicious to eat creations that really made my evening, along with a nice red that complimented the meal. I do love this kind of place, a spare combination of exposed original brick, minor theatrical set dressing (block and falls, hemp house rope, etc), the entry way with partially deconstructed original ornate plaster ceiling with exposed refurbishment holes. To top it off, because it really was a slow evening for them, we got a little tour of the theater and \"lobby\"/green room areas with a little history taboot. Really charming for a couple of old stage hands like us. It is a block off the CT train's Center Street station (a rock's throw from the Glenbow museum), so access could not be easier for those unfamiliar with the area relying on public transport. 
Thank you, Jennifer and Workshop for making our visit really special, and a slice of accessible and friendly culinary excellence in Calgary."}
{"text":"Workshop is by far my favourite restaurant in Calgary. I've been here numerous times and have always gone with the 5 course improv meal with wine pairing. Never been disappointed. The ambience is great. Really nice decor. Friendly staff. Took my girlfriend here for a birthday supper and they surprised her with a card that was signed by all the staff with some nice (and some very funny) messages. Thought this was a great gesture as opposed to the usual free dessert some establishments do at the end of your meal when your already too full to eat anymore."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something different and so we went to the Workshop for an early dinner our last night in Calgary. The space is very modern and tasteful, but still comfortable. The staff was friendly, informative and professional. Our waitress was great in making suggestions. We tried a variety of menu items and everything was amazing- not just good- amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here on a corporate group event. Small portions, lacklustre taste. Would never come here if it were not free. Overpriced and not worth it imho."}
{"text":"Hit on all cylinders.  One of the best dining experiences of my life.  Our waitress couldn't have been nicer.  We all tried something different and everything was wonderful"}
{"text":"My first visit to workshop was the second day they were open and I had such an incredible experience that I came back every week for months.  This past June I had the pleasure of hosting my birthday dinner at the restaurant and then reserved the upstairs for my birthday party.  Chef Kenny is a genius and has served up numerous creative and delicious plates. It is my favourite restaurant in terms of food and service.  I almost always have ordered their \"improv\" menu, never having had the same course twice and never having been disappointed.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing meal. Staff was super attentive and chef Kenny visited our table several times, once to ask which cut of the ribeye we wanted, more fat or lean, you had me at fat!

The space is very interesting, like it is a pop up staged in the lobby of a theatre, but obviously they are a permanent restaurant.  Best meal we have in Calgary by far..."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant in the downtown core in Calgary! Workshop Kitchen + Culture has very interesting decor and a modern and unique menu. I've been twice and both times was suggested to try the fixe menu, which I didn't get a chance to but will come back for.

Service was excellent, with regular check-ups and professionalism.

Food - we had the Brussel Sprouts, Fried Cauliflower, Gnocchi, Pork Loin, Rib eye. Honestly everyone one of these dishes was fantastic and I'd definitely get them again. Look forward to trying more of the money. Overall somewhat pricey but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm smacking myself for knowing about Workshop for over a year and not stopping in until recently. 

Workshop is located inside the Grand? Theatre. Is \"classy-rustic\" a  descriptor? Because it is what I would use. Not a ton of seating but the space is used well. Workshop has a pretty robust lunch menu, but the Lougheed Lunch (3 courses, 25$) caught my eye. 

I started with a cream of artichoke soup, served with a piece of pancetta and Parmesan. The soup was well balanced without too many overpowering flavours. My only complaint was that the artichoke pieces still all had the fibrous outer layers that are typically removed when serving artichoke hearts. My dining buddy quipped that perhaps it was intentional to \"help with my digestion\", but personally I'd prefer to stick to regular fibre sources. 

The main was phenomenal. the \"braise of the day\" was a brisket served with cornbread and broccolini salad. I'm always a little hesitant when it comes to \"brisket and bbq\" as I frequent Texas and am therefore a little sick of BBQ, especially when mediocre. However, I opted for the brisket and I was so wonderfully, pleasantly surprised.  

When you think brisket, you think tender, but you also think fatty in a sloppy, watery fat kinda way. Not so with Workshop's brisket - the meat was simultaneously tender yet not \"boiled to mush\" overcooked, with appropriate color and texture. The fat was present (it's brisket after all, part of the experience), but managed to avoid the watery fatty consistency many brisket iterations have the misfortune of having. 

Let's move onto the flavoring and the sauce. I am so incredibly over \"Brisket\" that has a 2$ bottle of superstore bbq sauce drenched on top and calling it BBQ. In fact I am so over the standard BBQ flavour profile regardless, so I was so excited to see that their flavour profile was a far departure from the dark oozy stuff one would typically expect. It wasn't even really a BBQ sauce - light, tangy, with bold flavour, but simultaneously not at all reminiscent of the bottled stuff.

The cornbread was also a wonderful surprise. I generally detest cornbread as the dry, flavourless crumble tends to taste like saw dust in my mouth, but rather than feeling as if my mouth was in a prison camp, Workshop's version of cornbread was light, subtly but well flavoured, and had a great texture. What a relief! 

Dessert was a fudge brownie, which I won't dwell on too much as it was too sweet for me but I'm a little bit of a princess when it comes to sweets so I can't hold it against them. 

Overall fantastic experience at Workshop. I fully expect this to be a go to lunch spot for me in the future."}
{"text":"This is a well deserved 5 stars. When I walked in to the restaurant, I was like what interesting décor. That's the first thing that caught my attention. I have heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. Yes I knew about the Lougheed Lunch which is named after the building they are in. 

So the Lougheed Lunch is $25 and it comes with a soup or salad, an braised entrée or fish and a dessert or fruit salad. 

I picked the soup, braised entrée and the chocolate brownie.

The soup was fantastic. I don't know all the ingredients in it but it had potatoe, bacon chives, etc and its a crème based soup. Delicious. It was an eye opener. The braised croquette is  basically a braised beef with a nice croquette batter. I remember something about chipotle sauce and that was about it. Yes she did listed the ingredients in the dishes but there were so many that we just don't remember.

The chocolate brownie was small but was also the right size. It had caramel on one side and cherry sauce on the other. It was really good. 

Overall, I loved the food here. No wonder the straight 5 stars rating. It really explains it all."}
{"text":"Improv dinner FTW! First night visiting Calgary and chose this based on Yelp rating. Yelpers rock! We chose the three course improv dinner along with the extra sides and everything was so good. Please note the menu will vary each night - which is half the fun! They will happily accommodate allergies and avoid things you especially dislike. 

Amuse bouche of duck breast with achiote and salsa verde started off on a great note. First course was beef thinly sliced with powdered olive oil (super interesting), red pepper sauce, and a salad with leeks, asparagus and arugula and a mustard seed dressing with pancetta jam. Superb. Sides started coming out: beets with almonds and a warm cumin-y seasoning we couldn't exactly place but really enjoyed, Brussels sprouts with maple syrup and spice - thankfully not too sweet - and my personal favorite - potato gnocchi with mushrooms and a truffle cream sauce. I didn't think I liked gnocchi other than the semolina/Roman ones until this. Little fluffy clouds of beauty. Main course was lamb with a carrot raisin salad, cauliflower purée (velvety smooth, too), green beans with pistachios, and little polenta-like cakes made with chickpea flour. I focused on the meat and veg which was a nice portion. With the extra sides it was really too much (but we did our best of course). Oh yeah and there was still dessert. Panna cotta with matcha cream, fruit loop/pop rock crumble, yuzu gel and cream, sponge cake, and a thyme (I think) tuile. This made me feel like a kid again - it was a happy and inventive dessert. 

My colleague from Calgary said this is the best place he's eaten in town. My colleague from London is worried tomorrow night's dinner won't possibly compete. Needless to say, we left happy and full. Awesome service, too and a great laidback vibe. Just go already!"}
{"text":"This meal in Calgary was absolutely amazing. The food and service were both on point. 

Eating here if you are in Calgary is a must do, and if I went again I would do the tasting menu as I'm sure it would be well worth it. 

We the pork cheek schnitzel, trout, pork loin, and a side of Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were probably the favorite, as they were cooked with maple syrup."}
{"text":"I had the Lougheed 3 course lunch special meal here and it was very delicious !  I had the braised beef cheeks and it was the most tenderest beef ever !  The mushroom soup was very tasty and I had the sasparilla root beer drink.  I was surprised that it was not a dark rootbeer color - but all the same , it was quite tasty !  I would come back here again because the food and the service was very very good.  They made sure that my lunch meal was done in the hour time so you would not be late back to work."}
{"text":"Limited menu selection, and VERY pricey. Expect to pay 22 dollars for a burger. 

Hostess was friendly
Server was slow and not familiar with menu."}
{"text":"Superb food, Great environment and fun staff.  The food quality here is impressive and the dishes are original.  It has a laid back vibe that's cool without being pretentious. The staff is knowledgeable and relatable.  I came here twice In a week and I was so happy."}
{"text":"Had the 5 course surprise meal. Some of it was a little too tricked out for me but it definitely showed the chef's skills and creativeness.  Worth a look."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and amazing food.  I was here with my spouse and five friends yesterday.  Everyone loved their plates, including me.  The gnocchi is 5lbs of ridiculousness.  I can still feel it sitting in my belly but it was worth it.  I'm not a huge kale fan but I tried the salad anyway and it was very flavorful.  One friend had the beef tartar and said it was the best she'd ever had.

I've never had a Mule cocktail before so thought I'd try their version of it.  It's extremely sweet and it didn't go well with my meal.  My spouse had a virgin Caesar and didn't finish it because he thought it tasted \"weird.\"  It's too bad because the presentation was nice.  He regretted not ordering a soda and I regretted not ordering a beer.

The metal chairs are horrible.  Not all seating is the same, thank goodness.  Our table had these cold, hard chairs with backs that are completely straight.  You can't relax and sit comfortably.  I noticed other people sitting on the same chairs using their coats to try and be comfortable and warm.  

I'd go back for sure but would definitely ask to avoid the metal seats."}
{"text":"Food came out excellent from appetizers to desserts.  We had the surprise 3 course meal and everything was fantastico marveloso. Highly recommended. We were visiting Calgary.

Got some good tracks from shazam'ing the playlist that was running as well."}
{"text":"After the delicious lunch, I just had to go back and try the dinner menu, and what an opportune time: Halloween on Friday night!

Dinner menu again was the same as lunch for appetizers, but the rest of the menu was segregated to Seafoods, Meats and Poultry and Sides to be shared family style like Briggs Kitchen and Bar.  But again what caught my eye was on the bottom of the menu: The Workshop Improv, a selection of items selected by the chef.  Since the set lunch didn't fail me last time, we all went with the 7 course option (3 and 5 course options are also available, with wine pairings also available). 

I wanted to try more of the Workshop Pops so I tried the Honey Lavender Lemonade (the real deal, straight from lemon tree in Springfield type lemonade), Sasparilla Root Beer (light and vanilla-like) and the Iced Green Tea (love green tea, this is my new fav based on this twist).   

Now bare with me, many of these dishes contained ingredients that I haven't even heard of before, so I may not be giving the dish description any justice, the pics will have to do!  The meal stared with a free sampler, Tuna Tartar on a Fried Wonton (great combo of texture with a savoury sauce).  Our first dish was an Atlantic Scallop on Parsnip Puree topped with a Kale Chip (formidable size scallop with great combo of flavours), Lamb Shoulder with Mushroom and Goat Cheese (wow, such tender lamb without the gamey taste), Butter Poached Prawn and Shiseido Pork Belly (like how the shrimp was just slightly undercooked; succulent, melt in your mouth pork belly), Apple Fennel Pate with Maple Syrup (a sorbet-like pallette cleanser with sweet soda pop \"broth\"), Angus and Striploin Steak with Potato Cake and Spinach au jus (evenly cooked exterior, the perfect medium-rare steak), and a combo dessert of Cherry Sorbet, Lemon Meringue, Lime Cultured, Caramel and Fried Pudding (cool way of mixing each flavour with the Fried Pudding, especially with the pop rocks in the sorbet). 

We had an opportunity to talk with Chef Kenny about halfway through which added insight and personality to the meal.  Now you may have noticed there are only six dishes.  Although I could have made it to the very end myself, my eating team was starting to tap out by dish four and couldn't even finish half of the delectable steak.   Our waitress took notice and offered to shorten our set course for us and charge us the 5 course rate!  Very accommodating of them to do so and a welcomed surprise. 

My wife probably said it best: \"there are not many meals that I remember, but from the first greeting at the entrance, to the variety of tastes throughout the meal, everyone there left a lasting impression that I'll never forget.\"  If you're looking for a fantastic meal, with great value and flavours that you probably haven't seen before, you owe it to yourself to check out Workshop Kitchen + Culture.  Just be sure to bring your appetite and some of your friends along for a great ride, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok.... This place is beautiful; and the service very friendly, even when in my opinion was slow... The food was not bad; the gnocchi were delicious; and the veal was great too!! I had the 3 courses option; where the chef pick every course and they pair the wine or drink... All meals were delicious!! Why 2 stars? Because my appetizer had A HAIR!!! A short one like a male hair; and in my table was only 3 girls and all of us with long hair!! Lol... That freaked me out; and I stopped eating the appetizer... I didn't say anything as I didn't want to make a show... But I definitely do not recommend going there!!"}
{"text":"Ughhhhhhhh!!!! SO GOOD for those business lunches!!! Have done the Lougheed Lunch several times now (soup or salad/choice of two proteins/fruit salad or deadly delicious dessert that's bite size) is cost effective and ever so tasty. Love the location for those long lunches."}
{"text":"Man, I just loved my dinner. I came by myself on a Monday evening and sat at the counter. I defaulted to a 3-course prix fixe menu and ordered a local beer to start. As the food was coming out, I chatted with the cooks, who were just the friendliest bunch. Though very busy, they engaged me in some small talk and I found this to be very personable. 

The wait staff was great also. From my waitress, I got the brief history of the building (the main concert hall in the first half of the 20th century that was saved from demolition by a group that turned it into a mixed performance + dining space). I recommend popping upstairs and checking out the bar and lounge that is used during the intermissions.  

If back in Calgary, I will make a point of coming back here."}
{"text":"5 Stars?  Why can't I give 20 stars.  Maybe even 100.  I wish I could give this place the god damn galaxy rating.

The first time I came here was in December with some friends, amazing time.  Why I didn't write the review then, I don't know, I was busy okay, but let me tell you about last night's meal at The Workshop.

It was my husband's birthday and even though he's old balls McGoo, I said no Denny's for you.  So we booked in at The Workshop for their \"Improv Menu\" which is essentially a 3, 5, or 7 course surprise tasting menu.  Trust the chefs they said, you'll be happy they said.  And yes, yes I was.  
The nice thing is you don't have to specify \"ummm, no.. um... weird shit please\" because everything they bring out is AMAZING.
And it's not even like 3 leaves of lettuce, it's incredible.  And filling, and meats sweatstravaganza.  New word. Look it up.

We opted for the 5 course Improv menu per our server Maya's suggestion.  Can we talk about Maya please for a second?  Amazing. Like amazing.  We had her back in December too and undeniably the best service anywhere in town.  She should start her own serving school and be like \"Look bitches, dis how it's done.\"  but she wouldn't say that because she's sweet as pie.

Anywho, we wanted to try the 7 course but  Maya advised it's \"a LOT of food\"
She doesn't know us, I thought.  girl, we could eat the hands off a clock.  That made no sense.  But we took her advice and went with the 5 course.  The 5 course Improv Menu is $70 per person.

We ordered some hand-crafted cocktails - my husband the cilantro vodka caesar and me the blackberry curve.  Ridic.

I will quickly fly through the courses so you get an idea of how much food we were eating and enjoying.  But note the menu changes DAILY.  The chefs are just like \"What do we want to make today?\" And then poor ol genius Maya is left to explain it all (and she does, she's amazing.)

Amouse Bouche - Tuna thingy with soy and pickle veg.  Yum.
1 -   2 huge scallops with maple n bacon n shizz.  Stupid good.
2  -   Lamb encrusted with yums, served with more yums.  Yum.
Palate cleanser - limey foam with plum ginger gelato thing. Yum.
3 - WTF, there's more?? Oh god here we go... Espresso encrusted striploin with fontina potato gratin and onions and baby carrots.  Falling asleep now.
Cheese plate - Tempura'd whipped brie with nuts and honey.  I'm in a coma now.
Dessert - Fack.  Alright here we go, home stretch - raspberry  flan (maybe a flan), yuzu thingy in the middle, and a little ginger cake with crème Anglaise.  Basil stuff on place too.

The chefs hate me now for destroying their menu for me last night, but let's not get caught up in the semantics.  The flavours are to die for, the portions are insane and the service, wine, and cocktails are unreal.  This is hands-down my new favourite restaurant.  I can't wait to come back here.  Thanks Maya for an awesome dinner and thanks The Workshop for an always amazing meal.  Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday at 7 but there was a wait! I guess they we're understaffed. Tried again on Tuesday and got a seat immediately. Definitely an upscale hipster vibe. The staff was very friendly and everything on the menu sounded great. My friend and I went with the Pork cheek appetizer. I may get just order 4 of these next time and call it a night. We also split the rockfish and trout with a side of Brussels sprouts. Very unique mixes for each. One was done Korean style and the other middle eastern. The beer selection was great as well. Will definitely be stopping back in."}
{"text":"5 Well-Deserving Stars!!  How neat and funky is this restaurant!  Interesting décor.

I was warmly welcomed and was led to my table where my friend was waiting for me.  We decided to order the Lougheed Lunch - 3 course meal for $25: 
- soup/salad - opted for soup - I had the Portuguese Sausage soup with kale - so good and hearty!  My friend had the mushroom soup.  I had a taste of her soup and it was very creamy.
- main - we both had the \"braise\" of beef cheeks.  So delectable!  The meat is so tender you can cut with your fork!  Comes with garlic mashed potatoes and brocollini.  There is also a choice of fish if you feel like seafood.  The mains change every day.
- dessert - we both chose the Brownie - Mmmm, mmmm, good!  Came with white little flakes of meringue & caramel sauce.
- choice of coffee or handmade soda - we both chose sasparilla root beer.  The drink came In a tall glass, the liquid was translucent with a hint of brown at the bottom.  Give it a quick stir with your straw and you will quickly find that it quenchers your thirst

Will absolutely, definitely be back at Workshop Kitchen + Culture @ Theatre Grand!!"}
{"text":"This place is a keeper. We were turned away from several restaurants because of crowds before fi sing Workshop but karma drew us to a better place. 

Workshop features a traditional menus but even better you can pick from their improve 3 or 5 course set dinners for a reasonable fee, the chef pairs a wine selection with each plate. 

My wife and I ordered the 3 part dinner. She went with their wine choices and I stuck with Buffalo Trace bourbon (which pairs with everything).  It was more than enough food and plates came out in a nice casual pace. 

Our waiter, Bobby, was perfect. He took care to explain the dishes but was over much a bother. 

The restaurant is sort of metro rugged ambience with a background low key electronic music selection that blends well."}
{"text":"$25 3 course lunch plus a pop. I had the tomato pancetta soup, fish of the day which was crusted with quinoa and a salmon croquettes and a brownie. Plus a lavender lemonade pop. Everything was fantastic and large portions. Would go back for sure as everything on the menu looked awesome!"}
{"text":"The Soy-Cured Steelhead Trout with crepes was one of the best dishes I have EVER had.  Our server, Brendan, was the very model of friendly, casual expertise.  The atmosphere is dark and glamorous.  Wines, with advice from Brendan, were excellent.  Would definitely return if I lived in Calgary and almost worth a special trip there from NYC."}
{"text":"Blown away !!! All around amazing from the decor, to the service ... to the last bite.  We decided to try the 7-course meal (which I found to be reasonably priced) and pairing.  Loved the break away from the conventional 7+ that seems to be the trend lately.  The pairing of sodas, cocktails, beer and some fabulous new wine favourites was intriguing and fun!  Best in Calgary!  Kudos to Chef Kaechele and his team!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and creative small menu.  I ate at the bar and got to watch the executive chef prepare my meal.  Prices are a bit high but great atmosphere, fresh creative food and friendly staff all overall I'd say worth the price."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times with friends. Have always been super impressed. Menu has been different both times that we have been here and we always want to try everything. Make sure to book a reservation as the place is quite small. I loved the open kitchen and ability to watch the whole process."}
