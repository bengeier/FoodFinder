{"text":"Attentive service Tasty dishes: Green chicken Thai curry, Red tofu Thai curry Mango salad big & tasty"}
{"text":"Excellent and inexpensive Thai. Great food and very quick service as well. Much better than the more expensive  spring rolls across the street."}
{"text":"My fave place in this area for lunch. Lovely decor, comfortable seating, great for groups (remember to make a reservation if you're going at lunch time, this place gets busy)!  Staff is friendly and they're great about splitting the bill.   Options for everyone, including loads of veggie/vegan and gluten-free dishes. Food is delicious and portions are a good size. The lunch specials are a great deal too.  My co-workers and I have noticed that some of the dishes that are very rich can leave you with that uncomfortable bloating feeling afterward. So if you have a sensitive stomach, steer clear of dishes that come with lots of sauce!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  We stopped in for takeout on a whim, and I decided to order Pad Thai, which can be horrible from the wrong place.  Their Pad Thai was excellent.  Not a hint of ketchup in sight, just tasty tamarind!  There was a LOT of it - I could probably get 3 meals out of my portion.  The toppings were also plentiful and excellently prepared - tasty tofu, chicken, shrimp, onion, pepper and peanut.   The restaurant is cozy, but very well appointed.  The decor is modern, but comfortable.  Overall, I was very impressed and will return."}
{"text":"Yum yum yummmmmy!!  TGI-Friday Lunch!!  Had the dim sum special - and it was pretty darn special.  I could be bias because I lovvvve dim sum.  Service was great, location convenient, its small trendy & casual and a great little lunch spot.  I hear the crispy beef special is good, looking forward to round-two!"}
{"text":"1. they have very cute tea cups.  2. the waitress was nice  3. lemongrass shrimp: vegetables are very fresh and crispy, shrimps were fat and chewy 4. friend had curry beef which i found too milky taste. 5. good environment, could have better seats. 6. will try dim sum plate next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! keep going here for lunches with colleagues time after time and never get bored of it!  the good is delicious! and they have nicely priced lunch menu. For $10 you can have a nice veg option lunch.  the staff is super attentive and remembers the clients. more than one time we were recognized and welcomed as special guests.   the service is pretty quick so we never had to stay there longer than our allocated 1hr  lunch.  another point is that they're good at accommodating larger groups (we went as a group of 8+ people for lunch few times and never had any issues)."}
{"text":"In Toronto, North York area on a business trip and my colleagues and I went walking around looking for a lunch spot. None of us had been to this place, but it was on a strip with several Asian restaurants and we looked inside the window and said \"OK, there's people inside, that's a good sign\" and decided to eat there. The sign on the window reads \"Tuyen: Modern Authentic Asian\".   One coworker and I each had a lunch special that came with Spicy Vegetable Soup that was really awesome. They were not playing around with the spicy-ness, though. At one point I coughed because it was so spicy, but the soup was so good it didn't deter me from consuming it all very quickly. For the rest of my order, I had \"Malaysian beef fried rice\". I wondered what about the fried rice made it Malaysian but I guess it was because it had pineapple in it. Interesting combination, but the yellow fried rice with scallions and strips of beef also in made it some of the best rice I've ever had. It was served in a cool white slanted bowl that was resting in a basket. I think it was the type of bowl that would not stand upright on a table. It was a large portion of rice too, and I almost finished it.   Service was good and the meal came out fast. Prices, I later found out, were pretty reasonable for Toronto. I would definitely like to visit Tuyen again for lunch or dinner on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I think I can sum this place up as a Spring Rolls knock off. They have less choice but the food is fairly safe and uninspired for the most part. There are suggestions of \"Asian-ness\" that maybe don't  resonate quite as the owner intended...check out the enormous urns encased in a glass display downstairs by the bathroom. Interesting, but I'm not sure whether to be impressed by bathroom-hallway decor or mystified as to how a wannabe ROM display ended up at Yonge and Sheppard.  Both times I've ordered dishes here they were okay - definitely on par with Spring Rolls. Plenty of fresh veg but the sauces used are fairly sugary.  The wait staff here are overly keen to sell you as much booze as possible, so that seems to be an issue. Service was very prompt but the pressure to move on was clear once the place filled up. Bathrooms were extremely clean, which always impresses me."}
{"text":"2.5 stars as this place was pretty uninspiring.   Decor and interior is modern and very \"standard\" asian-fushiony.   The service was slow, despite only a few other tables of patrons. Server was friendly but I could see the staff idling in the back room making small talk and not being overly attentive to the customers.  The menu consists of Chinese and Thai dishes. My Moo Shu Guy was disappointing... it didn't taste awful, but it definitely wasn't authentic. It was slathered/stir-fried in hoisin sauce (usually this is served on the side) and the wraps it came with were dried out on the edges. Not overly appetizing but it was just OK."}
