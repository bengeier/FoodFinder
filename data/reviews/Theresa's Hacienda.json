{"text":"New business still waiting for their liquor license.  Owners are (or were) involved with Raul and Theresa's Mexican restaurant in Avondale, AZ. The Chile Relleno is excellent.  We definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"This place was the BEST!  Where are they now, we went by and a Church now owns the building?  We Love their food, where's Theresa?  The original is not that good, this was the best!"}
{"text":"THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED - See their new Raul & Theresa's on Litchfield Road, just north of I-10"}
{"text":"Ate here last year and never got around to finishing the review.  Now it seems they have closed.  No surprise really.  They were definitely attentive and friendly here (staying on top of drink and chip refills) but the food took forever and all we ordered were appetizers. They have a menu item that says they have spicy dish with 11 different fresh chiles but when I asked to try a fresh one to spice up their one and only mild salsa, I got a look of confusion. Eventually I got two bland jalape√±os. Interesting."}
