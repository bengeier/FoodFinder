{"text":"Out of multiple items on the menu, the Buffalo chicken sandwich was bland, tasted like the Buffalo sauce. Chicken strips were gross, fries were ok. The waitress was very rude, felt like everything was an inconvenience for her."}
{"text":"Horrible... wait staff very unfriendly and they were out of half the stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast while waiting for arrival.... Expected too much for an airport diner, that's for sure. Waitress was kinda snarly to start with. We got the scrambled egg special. You would think that would be a super easy meal, right? Wrong! The scrambled eggs were powdered eggs...... The food was cold, and the toast? I think it was cut from pieces of cardboard or Styrofoam. Either way, it was hard and dry, even after slapping a generous amount of butter on it. It just wouldn't absorb it and soften...... I totally do NOT recommend at all. Will be skipping this place when I come back here."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while waiting for our family on a different flight. Good selection of beer. Quick, friendly service. My husband ordered the River Dog and loved it."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place to have a last minute meal with our relatives before our flight departed. The whole experience was painful. The service was slow and waitress seemed to have no concern. She didn't write down our order and forgot my brother's meal entirely so they had to take time to make it while the rest of us had our food. Pretty sure the burgers are microwaveable patties, which is especially a shame since it's one of 2 kinds of entrees on the menu.   Avoid if possible and just grab something after security."}
{"text":"They had no white wine, the fryer was broke so no fries.  Despite that I order the buffalo chicken salad with no tomato and honey mustard. It came with tomato and ranch....took forever even for that.  Chicken was gummy and gross.  Took one bite and asked for check which also  took forever!"}
{"text":"It's Monday afternoon and you have no appetizers. Half the salads are gone. Out of hamburgers. Waitress just said you just ran out of french fries. Who manages this place? They need a new job. Horrible."}
