{"text":"Eastway Captn D's is the best.  The restaurant is clean. Bathrooms are clean. Staff is attentive and helpful.  Captn D's is my 87 yo mother's favorite fish restaurant.  We use to visit the Concord (Hwy 29) location until their service became atrocious.  So, we traveled a bit south into Charlotte to find another Captn D's.  We've been to Eastway twice. We drive the extra miles for the service and kindness at Eastway.  Thanks to the crew.  It means a lot to an old lady, and daughter, who love your fish.  Our time together, at Captn D's is special, and we are Very grateful for the part your kind and attentive staff play in our monthly eat out experience.  Thanks, Eastway~  You made my 87 yo mom happy~  ty ty ty  And when the crew gave her special attention, it made her feel extra special.  Eastway Rocks!  Thx, Crew~."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!  Went through the drive thru today 2/1/2017 @ 4:15.  When I drove up to the window the employee just barely opened the window for my money---as if it were raining outside (it wasn't raining---it was a beautiful day)!  I didn't think much of it  however when she returned with my food she didn't say one word to me---just stuck her hand out!  When she returned with my change once again she didn't speak one word!  As I looked at her with a surprised face she SLAMMED the drive thru window and turned and leaned down on the counter to continue a conversation with another employee!  She was rude and very disrespectful!!  I want be going back to that location anytime soon!!!"}
{"text":"The lunch today was very reasonable: Broiled fish w/rice, green beans, loaded baked potato, and roll. They asked is we wanted any condiments [important since this was the drive thru]. 
Fish was cooked perfectly.  btw- The fish was freshly cooked after we ordered, so it was not dried out For a fast food  place we were impressed.  The only reason we did not give 5 stars is because there was only one piece of fish. We would pay another dollar for another piece of fish [even a half piece], and a bit more rice. With this meal, we did not need a baked potato also, we probably should have had a salad or slaw instead! The restaurant looked clean on the outside. The employee at the drive thru window was very pleasant."}
{"text":"WoW! The food is great. The sweat ice tea is awesome, and most of all there sanitation score is an \"A\".  Great place for seafood."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service.  Twenty five minutes wait for my food.  Six cooks in the kitchen, and I had to wait half an hour .  Never again."}
{"text":"I should've known by the sanitation score this wasn't a good place. I was suppose to get country fish and got regular on my sandwich what. And it wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place one last chance.... as my last two visits was a nightmare.  thought the drive through pulled in 5:50 pm no one in front. Speaker garbled words placed order after several repeats. 6:pm lady took money at window.........6:05 turned off engine........6:35 cars backing up behind me  finally food delivered.   pulled to parking space  No tarter sauce for fish, no napkin, no straw for drink, no dressing for salad.... went to inside to get forgotten items......food was warm but not hot.  the crew walking around in a daze like asked three time for items another 15 minutes....I could have driven to the other D's in Pineville or Monroe for the time Spent here to get warm food and no service"}
{"text":"Nothing for the money unless you like dry fish jerky for $11.00 and no service.  
The service is horrible. I could not believe how dry the fish and \"hush puppies\"  are.  Will never make that mistake again."}
{"text":"I am so thrilled to see that Captain Ds is remodeling. I love the new paint and fresh wooden booths. But i mostly love the fresh food that is made to order and brought to your table. Friendly staff and good up to date music too"}
{"text":"Three things you need to know, and that is all. 

1. After eating here, I must have drank an entire gallon of water, it was so salty. 

2. I had a $2 off coupon for Captain D's and was in a pinch for food one day and decided to stop in real quick for some sustenance. 

3. The food was obviously previously frozen and the deep-fried items didn't taste right. (You know that rancid oil taste when you don't change out the deep fryer?) The tile floor was sticky and slick, and tables not wiped down. 

Overall, I felt greasy and un-clean after eating here.  If you see a Long John Silver's, I'd recommend that over this Cap D's location."}
{"text":"Use to be a great little fish place till they done away with the jumbo shrimp. I guess I will be finding another fish place to eat real soon. Nice knowing you captain!!"}
{"text":"Jackie the cashier fantastic!  She helped me choose my shrimp and fish meal which was pretty good.  
But...husband's meal not so good. 1 piece of fish was fishy tasting, and the baked potato tasted like it was baked 4 dozen times. 
Dinning room so stuffy ugh and its 91Â° outside"}
{"text":"It was my co-workers choice to pick out our lunch spot and she had a craving for some fried fish and since our options were limited she chose Captain D's!

We walked in and the place was pretty empty. The cashier greeted us and took order right away!  We found a table and waited and waited...finally our food arrived and I realized the wait was for them cooking it up right then! Yesss!!!

I chose the fish tenders and fries combo. I've had it before, but it was much better this time since it was nice and hot!

 I was a little disappointed in two things from my visit, first the fries were cold! If you took the time to make the fish why not the fries??? And they charged me $.10 for a cup of water?!? Really??? 

But I mean overall, I left full and the food was pretty good. So I will be back!"}
{"text":"It was a Sunday afternoon and I was craving some fish, so I stopped by this location to try their new special that included fish tenders and fries.

The parking lot is a bit of an amusement park of sorts, you can either go around the entire business and park on the hill or behind the business and \"drive thru\" order board and park there. Needless to say, you should be very careful parking. 

I walked in and the place was pretty empty, so I was hoping for quick service, ordered the special and then waited....and waited. I hoped that meant they were cooking it up nice and fresh for me. When the order was finally ready, I asked for some condiments, and was on my merry way. 

I was not WOWed by the service, but hey, she took my order and the food was hot. 

I agree with previous reviews the food was a little salty, but its pre-frozen fish so I wouldn't expecting anything less. The fish tenders were good, you get four of them in the order and they were crunchy an flaky. The french fries were hot, I just wish there would have been a few more of them! 

So pretty much, I got exactly what I expected at this location and with the food. A-OK."}
{"text":"It's not bad but it's not great. The menu was wrong and the person who took my order needs some help with customer service skills. Everything was average except for the cocktail sauce, which was really good."}
{"text":"I got a 2 piece fish an fry today the fries were old an burnt ... the fish was old an greesy... I got my $$$ back .. the food should've been waste .. pass this location!!! This is not my first time getting old food .. wet greesy fish"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Idk why everyone's complaining. I begged hubby to take me here for the second time. The good is sooooo yummy. Don't let the other reviews fool you. Trust me I tell it like it is.. Although it's considered fast food it's the best place ever!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is dated but excellent service and very good food. The workers are very sweet and the restaurant is in a very good location which is right off of exit 34."}
{"text":"The worst Captain D's I've ever been to. And probably won't ever go to again. I was with my mother and we wanted shrimp plates without coleslaw, and substitute coleslaw for more fries. Yet, they had a shrimp basket that offered that (no coleslaw, just fries) but didn't offer it to us. We changed out order and ordered one of each after getting to the window. Got our food and they looked exactly the same. The  un-knowledgable associate needs to get training on what the restaurant offers, because this was awful. The shrimp plate had popcorn shrimp mixed with larger fried shrimp which I'm pretty sure wasn't how it was supposed to be and the fries were awful. I will never go back here. Ever."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something less expensive good and you can't go wrong with fried fish.  Stop by and check out this Captain D's clean and staff as well trained and friendly service with a smile."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places to eat.  Since they've been under new management and have a new crew, I hate this place. The whole entire staff is rude. The crew members do not respect the managers and will go word for word with him in front of customers. I usually get the triple treasure twice a week. My last two visits, I was told that I could not get it. It is almost lunch time, please tell me why y'all are not prepared?? This is the ONLY location that gives me trouble, yet the closest to me. I will be taking my business else where, if I ever decide to eat at Captain D's again. I hate rude service and not being able to get what I want. Not just one time but again this is the second time. Throw the whole damn crew away..."}
{"text":"Good food but all fried . The light battered fish and fan tail shrimp are yummy but fried.  No getting around that fried yummy fish! They do offer salmon and that comes on a salad but why would you go there for that when you can get that yummy battered fish & shrimp? 
You know you want it ! It's good ..."}
{"text":"Where to begin my review as this will be my 1st and last review for this place.  I will definitely be sending a letter to the corporate office on this place. Upon entering for my families 1st time trying this spot for take out it would be our last.  I was in total shock seeing the cashier handling the register then placing lids on the tartar sauces used for the meals.  At no point was any washing of the hands or using gloves ever attempted, mind you dealing with the register.  As my families meal was brought out, I see a line cook stuffing his face with no gloves on just his bare hands.   I said to myself, this is unsanitary practices being used here.  I then ask another worker to call the managers attention who's behind her and she gets into the \"deer\" mode, acting as if who's the manager. I finally make eye contact with him as he knew I was right and went to the kitchen to possibly tell the guy stuffing his face, you got caught.  The manager was looking all dirty himself too, no name tag, no indication that he's the manager.  I asked for a full refund, I was not spending my money here.  I then ask for his name which he pulls out his a$$ and says it's \"Mr. Rapport\".  Well that's the name I'll use when I compile a letter to the corporate office.  Please beware of this place, save your money for a pack of bologna instead."}
{"text":"Food was as expected but the roaches were not.  Only a score of 91.5 and watched 3 roaches run around the kitchen as i waited 25 minutes for my food.  Not real happy."}
{"text":"Every single time i visit this place, my food is NEVER & i mean NEVER!!!!! Right! I have ALWAYS went home with the food & opened my box & it was wrong. To the point of me now checking my food before I leave the restaurant & it still is wrong! So i keep going back because I receive coupons in the mail from them often. I also am allergic to fish. I can however eat shellfish & I can eat their shrimp because it is cooked in separate grease than their fish. I am unsure to visit another Captian D's because this may not be the case. So the food is genuinely always good. Your order will just NEVER be correct. & There is a lady their, i believe her name is Mrs. Jennifer....she is the evening manager & she's comparable to a Drill Sargent, all she does the entire time your inside waiting on your meal is yell at other employees what to do. She'll speak kindly to customers, but get straight forward with you if there's a problem with your order. Also they charge for substituting sides. If you think you can swap out coleslaw for free, you're sadly mistaken. Maybe they wont tell you, but look on your receipt!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you craving for fried fish and want quick service with nothing to fancy. I went here twice. Both times is through the drive thru. Service was quick. First time, I had something like 4 fried filets with coleslaw. Actually what I expected. Very flaky and hot. Yesterday I order 2 fish filets with 6 fried shrimps, baked potatoes and a corn on the con. I must be carving because I can't complain. However, before you drive off. Check bag for condiments. They didn't provide with any butter nor  sour cream for my potato so I ate it plain. Will come back once the craving hit again!"}
{"text":"If you are craving seafood and you are up to a quick bite, this is the place for you.
I had a sampler platter with hush puppies, shrimp, tenders, slaw, green beans and tenders.
The food was great, the service was good, the price is fair and the amount of food just on point. I shared this dish with my husband and we were satisfied at the end."}
{"text":"Doesn't deserve one star.  These people steal your money and give you a half serving.  This place doesn't deserve to stay in business.  

So pissed off!  This is what I ordered: 2 pc catfish meal... where's my catfish fool!  I should have known they were up to something when I pulled up at 8:15pm, waited 5 minutes for someone to speak at the drive-thru and all lighted signage was turned off.  I got robbed by Captain D's!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Sunday and they were out of fries. Yes fries, a staple of fish and chips which is pretty much their business. But not to end the foolishness there they were also out of soda. Maybe this was my diet fairy stepping in and stopping me from consuming some additional calories.#AllFishAintHealthy #ButthatBatter"}
{"text":"Toss up between a 2 and a 3 but in the end, service pulled it down to a 2.

Went to a Yelp Elite event earlier in the evening and due to being held up at work, got there about 7:15 pm and the food goodies were gone. Stayed and socialized and had a good time with my fellow Yelper who I have come to t enjoy their input, feedback and comradely 

Had a good time but left and went out to seek out diner.

Since I live North of Charlotte in Cornelius, involves a trip up I-77.  Been awhile since I have had fish so I tried this one off of Exit 16.

Drive in is unbelievably slow as is service at the window.

Pulled up and paid and just waited... and waited .. and waited and then got my order.

20 minutes and only one car ahead of me.

Home in another 15 minutes and tried to eat some of the French Fries on the way home. Way too greasy and soggy so would not order that again.

The Fish Sandwich on the other hand was great. Should have just stayed with it.

Large portion of a very delicate flaky fish and there are more than one in the sandwich.

This is the main reason should consider stopping by. It was great.

Would recommend and it;s off I-77, Exit 16 in NC on the east side."}
{"text":"This place sucks. We drove all the way here from the Pineville Captain D's because they had a sanitation score of 90. Got here and at least it was 95 but we were starving so we decided to stay. We ordered two Alaska Salmon meals with grilled shrimp and after a short wait, we were brought salmon cakes, grilled shrimp, and some random butterfly shrimp (that we didn't order). 

When we told the person who brought our food who also happened to be the same person who took our order, he literally tried to convince me that fried salmon cakes were the same thing as grilled fillet of flounder smh. So then he goes back \"to check\" and someone who I assume was a manager inquired about our order and told us to keep it and he would bring back two pieces of salmon. Fine. 

Two seconds later he comes backing talking about \"where's your receipt? I need to charge you for the salmon.\" I said whatever and handed it to him thinking that he was just charging us the difference but no! This nimrod was proceeding to charge us for 4 meals because of their error! Even after he agreed that it's ridiculous he still said he had to charge us. 

At that point we were just like forget it. We will keep the salmon cakes bc not only were we hungry after not having eaten all day but we were on a time crunch and didn't have time to wait. 

Then a person came by with a dark blue shirt that seemed managerial and when my partner asked if he was the manager, his basic reply was: \"in training.\" WHAT?
Like. Seriously? No \"yes I am how can I help you? Is everything ok?\" Nothing! He then walked off and sat with the person who was the manager and neither of them acknowledged us. 

No one expects great customer service in fast food but I do and that's absolutely what I didn't get. I guess they don't teach common sense in orientation."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service. The food is always hot and tastes great. This is my go to spot for a quick lunch break."}
{"text":"love their fish but customer service is the worst....caution: If you pay with a card please ensure they charge you for what you ordered because they dont confirm before charging your card."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and to my surprise its senior Wednesday...  Lunch 4.99.   It was well attended ny seniors who obviously got the word and didn't just stumble in like me...   Great service from Keshia,...  Had the. 5 shrimp platter which hit the spot....  Only disappointment was they were out of key lime pie.....   Nice spot"}
{"text":"First time at Capt D\"s in a very long time and it had been even longer at this one. It hasn't changed or remodeled or improved except the ones behind the counter are more friendly. This location could really use a makeover. It never seemed clean. But I wanted to try the Lobster roll. And you what, it was pretty good for the money. A little less then $4.00 for two rolls. Each about 3-4 bites. I'd have them again as a appetizer. Or a snack. I also tried the Lobster Bites. Please don't. Really not worth the money or taste or calories.  And if the owner/manager of this location sees this please spend some money and clean this place up."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door \"welcome to captain D's,\" from 3 or 4 welcoming employees.  The manager went out of his way to bustle around trays with a smile when orders were ready and the other employees when there wasn't a line rounded to ask if we needed anything.  The table could have been cleaned off a little better but the food was good and as ordered and the customer service was over the top for a fast food experience ! This is what my elderly grandfather looks forward to when he dines out - Thanks crew !"}
{"text":"Okay let me break it down for you like this; It's Captain D's! They have fish and some chicken. I don't expect a lot from this place. You may find yourself waiting in the drive-thru and being approached by a bum looking for money. When that happens it goes down as such; \"hey you got any money?\", \"uh no\" (which they know is a lie because you are buying food), \"ah come on man just a dollar\", \"I don't carry cash\" (which is a lie because you do). You then wait for like 20 minutes while the bum watches you hand the cashier a crisp twenty dollar bill. You then make eye contact with the bum and feel ashamed. You can see it in his eyes, the whole \"you son of a bitch\" look. I usually crack a smile at this point because I'm all like \"the joke's on you bum\". By the way, what in the hell does the D stand for? Dirty? Delicious? Dangerous? Historians maintain the history has been lost forever. I will just assume it stands for \"Captain Don'tcomehereanymore\""}
{"text":"Horrible Captain D's! Do not go here! I used to frequent this location but when they refused my birthday coupon from their own home office after honoring it last year! Well, they'll never get my business anymore! Calling their corporate office to report them as well!"}
{"text":"This place took 45 mins to get my meal. And it's a fast food restaurant it's insane don't come here. And it is very nasty and messy and dirty. I'm very sad that this place is so bad it needs to go out of business or needs new management."}
{"text":"For fast food, this location had great service. We were coming back in town and were hungry, but didn't want your typical fast food. We were glad we landed at Captain D's.

I haven't been at this chain in a long time so I was overwhelmed by the menu. I was pleasantly surprised by all of the healthy options. However, I just was craving fried fish and shrimp. My sides were green beans and fried okra. Even though the batter is thick and crunchy, it still doesn't taste too heavy in oil. The green beans were cooked in plenty of ham and were salty. The okra was okay. I was disappointed, they forgot my hushpuppies so I ate my husband's. 

They brought my food to me and the inside was clean. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went in around lunchtime one weekday and the line was out the door... the person behind the register was training  another person, so it was slow going... Another person at the register was trying to get the food ready but she didn't know what she was doing either.. then a customer got her food and it was cold. Not good. I couldn't stay and eat because I was on a time constraint. I most definitely will not be visiting this Captain D's again.."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch and I was totally disappointed. The two scrawny pieces of fish they brought was the same size as the fries. One burnt hushpuppies was all that was on the plate. $7.15. What a rip-off. Stay away if you want a decent meal. I went to Captain's Galley and got a real plate of fish for the same price."}
{"text":"We went there wanting seafood, we left feeling discriminated against.

We went in and ordered.  We noticed both Caucasian and African Americans guest spread out thru out the diner.  We are Caucasian and Hispanic.  We sat at the booths on the side of the dinner near side parking lot.  We had a view of the entire dinner.  Wait wasn't long for food.  While waiting, we notice a young African American woman worker walking around, asking guests if they needed anything for refills.  Thought that was nice.  Not till after we got our food - we noticed the same worker walking around, with a tray of side items, to guest asking if they wanted another serving of fish.  Then we noticed it was only to African American guest.  Half thru our eating we noticed the same worker with tea offering refills and passed us, as well as the other Caucasian guests, and never offered us anything.  After that, we had enough and decide to finish what we had in our hands and leave.  

We will never return to this Captain D's.  This will be sent to someone for further review.  This dinner does not rate a star but had to put one to leave a post."}
{"text":"Holy crap we went to get a rather quick dinner to take home. Pull up to the drive-thru and sat behind a customer who looked to be waiting place her order. After a good or rather not so good 10minutes I called the store from the drive-thru to let them know people were outside ready to give them money in exchange for nourishment. She proceeds to take the folks in front of us, their order. So we place our's and are told to pull around. After 15 of waiting behind the young lady in front of us and, unknown to us a person already at the window I pulled off and went to super-fast Burger King, he says with chagrin. I shalt be returning."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what the hubbub is about with some reviews because I genuinely like this Captain D's.  It is my comfort food go to stop when I'm craving fried fish, hush puppies, and Cole Slaw.  

First, let's face it, this a very crowded location and I've never been when their wasn't a wait.  But, the team always tries to move things along and prevent backupd. Only really challenges is when car loads of folks go through tge drive through and order for 6 people and then divide checks.  That's just a drive through etiquette problem #Rude. 

My orders have always been correct, they remind me to ask for sauce, food is hot, and the smell is heavenly.  Can't say there is a way to improve on the quality of the food.  It's fried and it's delicious. 

Only drawback is the wait when the line is long.  5 Stars for everything but the wait.  Kudos"}
{"text":"The fried green tomatoes are so thin all you can taste is the breeding. The tea is not sweet, what my husband ordered on has one piece of fish, one white fish, one crab where as in charlotte they give him three of each. I don't eat fish, but the tomatoes and his food were disappointments."}
{"text":"When you have a manager that has worked there since 1980, you can expect consistently, customer service, and quality food. This is the experience I have at Captain Ds. I come to this location each visit home. Too bad the closest one to me in Maryland has closed and the next closest is about 2 hours away. I prefer this Captain Ds over other locations. I am truly addicted to this fish!"}
{"text":"Damn it. I love Captain Ds. In fact, it's one of my favorite restaurants in the area. Always reliable, delicious, and friendly. The manager at the Monroe location has worked there since I was born, over 3 decades ago!! So, it's safe to say that she knows the business. I like it but I guess it's not for everyone."}
{"text":"Whew! Service here is god awful. Slow slow slow. The cashier was getting confused with the orders and several people cancelled their orders and left. Many were waiting for their orders to be called and it was only a few orders. The cashier under her own admission got overwhelmed and said \"it's never been this many customers here at one time\". What made it worst was the manager was frustrated with her employee and began to chastise her on the floor. The cashier after being chewed out unfortunately took it out on the customers. This definitely would not meet chic fil a standards. To make it right she did offer a drink or dessert for the wait but it was embarrassing to witness. Come on y'all do better. Atleast the food was hot and fresh but that was after we gave them our receipt and they forgot to make our order so they had to redo it ."}
{"text":"For greasy fried seafood, we go to Captain D's to satisfy our cravings. Captain D's is very similar to Long John Silver's and offers a very similar menu of fried seafood, chicken planks, hush puppies, and more. The Deluxe Seafood Platter which has batter dipped fish, shrimp, seafood stuffed crab shells, hush puppies, fries, and cole slaw is very filling and tasty. Captain D's also offers healthier options such as grilled fish, baked potato, salads, and vegetables.  Don't forget the boxed slice of pecan pie for dessert!"}
{"text":"Saucy drive through service. 

Meal ok because Fish was hot but  Fries cold as winter in Wisconsin. 

Shrimp are not flour battered but that cornmeal batter."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been at a Captain D's in over 20 years.  This location is on the west side of Charlotte, and the area has seen a lot of changes over the years.  This Captain D's has been here the whole time.

While I am not one for fast seafood, or drive-thru fish stands, this Captain D's was really quite .....old.  It does not appear to have been updated anytime recently, but I was surprised by the cleanliness of the restaurant.  The Sanitation grade was 97.0.

I ordered the 10 piece value pack, which is really not a bad value if you have a couple of friends go in on the meal.  You get 10 pcs of fish, 8 hush puppies, a pint of slaw, and a lot of fries.

What I did notice was that regardless of what you ate, it felt really greasy. I am not that fond of Captain D's however the friends seemed to be slathering over the meal and thanked me for being the delivery driver of such fine fast fish.  

I feel that I have not missed much in the last 20 years by not eating here, but apparently they have enough followers who enjoy the value and speed at which they can provide a meal.

While this type of seafood restaurant does not appeal to me, it was very clean. The cashier and staff were very friendly, the food was hot, fresh, and very timely.  

As this could be considered my \"first impression\" , I give it 3 Stars,

{"text":"This was rather a first time in over 5 years that I've been back here. We decided to go to the drive thru and after placing an order, sat waiting for about 10 minutes or so. 

My husband ordered the grilled fish with grilled shrimp and according to him, the rice, veggies and shrimp was yummy while the tilapia was alright. 

I spotted a sign indicating they serve 'FRESH' fried oysters and knowing me, I've been trying to find a new place that serves them. This platter option was not listed on their menu so we were unaware of the price. The lady told us it was six pieces and it was tiny six pieces. 

(I know, why risk getting oyster in a fast food joint. Because, it sounded good. We will see if it will make me ill later. I'll update this if it does.)

Hushpuppies are, well, they're fried. Almost everything is fried here. So it could be a bit dry but to me, it's like cornbread. 

I'm surprised I was given a full ear of corn on the cob. I was expecting half of one. 

Overall, we enjoyed our meal. Although the price would be something like Applebee's for two. Drinks were not included in our platter meals."}
{"text":"I actually ate here last week and it was a total bust. However, I went to the restaurant website and left a review there. I am willing to let anyone correct a bad experience, and correct it they did. Tonight the food was exactly what I have experienced on many other occasions. Last week was an entirely different crew. This week they are marching to the beat of the right drum. The food was hot and served quickly and correctly. The staff were attentive and polite. This was an enjoyable dinner for sure."}
{"text":"I really try not to eat here much, so the time away you would think they would get it together.  This place is the slowest fast food in the history of fast food.  I ordered two fish sandwiches and as long as it took you would think I ordered several family meals.  I waited for 20 minutes, someone came to the window once and said it'll be a few minutes and get this he was the cook.  The people up front was so engulfed in their conversation I don't think they even remembered I was sitting there.  Finally my food was ready and I got a potato, well no forks, no butter, no sour cream, no nothing. And the guy looked at me and said oh I didn't know you wanted those things. But h did give me one napkin how sweet. This place stinks, and some how after all that time the food was not good. Imagine that."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest seafood lover, so when I want some I need it fried. I've been going to Captain D's for years now but this one is a serious disappoint. The fish and shrimp dinner wasn't good at all. I ordered it to be cooked fresh but the shrimp was hard and wasn't fresh at all. When I call back to the manager he said they (the shrimp) had been sitting there for 10mis before the fish was cooked . The manager did make it better with a comp meal. However I was disappointed with quality! The costomer service helped to soften the blow of the disappointing food. When I picked up my comp meal it was hot and fresh and more like the quality I remembered thanks to a manager that really knows how to go above and beyond to make the customer feel better."}
{"text":"just picked up some food. there's a hair fried into the outside of my hush puppy. gross. going to get my money back. worst seafood I've ever tasted EVER..."}
{"text":"I generally don't have dinner at this facility, however today I felt like some fish and was at the drive-through getting what I thought was a regular fish dinner. It was my fault I ordered something that was different from what I expected. After I drove off I turned around, went inside, requested to verify that what I ordered was what I received. And management and the staff were so kind and friendly, they without hesitation asked me what I actually thought I was getting, and took what I ordered back and exchanged it without any fuss or cost or any hassle to what I actually wanted. Even though it would've been an up charge to it. What a great way to serve a customer. I will definitely recommend this facility and command to management and the team for their efforts."}
{"text":"Hello friends, 

I've come here a few times and each time I've find myself thinking I should have grabbed a snack while I waited. The 1st time I figured it was just busy and not the norm. Uuuuuuuunfortunately I've since gone back a few other times and \"The survey Sayssssss\" they.... are..... very.... very...Sssslllooowwwww!!! (Insert sad, hungry face here).

{"text":"Typical Captain Ds...nothing special. ...food was as expected. ..staff was friendly...the ice tea was decent, not bad but not great either....Captain Ds is a little on the pricy side. Ok if by yourself but if feeding a family you may as well go to Redlobster for the price. $2.50 for a 32oz drink is ridiculous! That bumps the $7.99  meal up above  $10 not to mention the extra $.69 they charge for Mac and cheese...KFC and Bojangles are better values."}
{"text":"Pretty good fried fish, fried seafood place in a somewhat run-down seen-better-days drive through.  Maybe a step above other chain places like Long John Silvers and a couple notches below Red Lobster.  The main attraction for me is that it's open late and right across from the motel I was stuck in.  It's a good choice if you just got off a cramped flight.  The drive through was fairly efficient, somewhat polite, got my order correct and the food was okay."}
{"text":"As weird as it sounds, i spent my birthday here tonight. I've always loved Captain D's since i was a toddler. Tonight's service was awesome, staff was respectful and prompt. The fish was wonderful. They didn't know it but they helped make my birthday even better. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that Captain D's is my all time favorite restaurant... ok with that being said, I absolutely hate this particular location. The fish is scrawny, burnt, rubbery, and dry. I dont think i will ever go back to this location again. From now on I'll just drive to either Charlotte or Monroe (the best!)."}
{"text":"I ordered to go tonight. When I got home I found the fish to be dry and the green beans to be flavorless. The shrimp was good, but that's all."}
{"text":"Been here many times and almost always everything is perfect. I usually order the giant fish sandwich, (captain) and it's the best value is fish sandwiches ANYWHERE. For less than $10 you can a truly amazing fish sandwich and drink with fries! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had to give my order twice at the drive thru then was asked to give it again by another employee. When I inquired about the whole order It was rudely repeated to me as a fact. Of course after getting home I found the order was wrong and half of it was burnt."}
{"text":"When I realized we'd be staying closer to Captain D's for the next three days, I was looking forward to it. I love seafood. But this was like going into your enemies house for dinner and ordering from someone who hates you. Shawntee was unbelievably rude and surely. Not to mention unkempt. A shame really. The food was really good and fresh. I would have liked to try their other choices. Because of her I won't be back. There are too many places around here to choose from."}
{"text":"1st REtry after 15yr lapse~best part of the shrimp dinner was the hush puppies, and they were cold. slaw #2 positive. The shrimp were teeny & tasteless, but plenty in # for $8+.
the restaurant was clean, with 95.5 sanitation rating, staff polite, hard working, professional. The food just won't bring me back...for at least another 15yrs."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the drive through. While the fish was too greasy and the fries were limp, when we got home five minutes later, there were no forks or napkins or tartar sauce or ketchup. What's up with that? I won't be back."}
{"text":"Many things wrong. First the drive way looks like someone took a jack hammer to the parking lot many deep holes afraid to take my truck fear of flat tired. Bathroom was a mess and disgusting.  The staff were very rude I paid a little under 10 dollars and got nothing. If you can find a captains galley go their. I wouldnt go or eat here again if my food was free."}
{"text":"Ugh!   I wish there was another Captain Ds in the area.  This restaurant is so gross and it's dirty.  I like Captain Ds.  But this location puts the name to shame."}
{"text":"I just love their fish! I wish there was a captain D's closer in Fort Mill because there's really not much of a selection for good seafood here unless you want to go super high-end. 
I've only ever gone through the drive-through, and I've always received a very nice service. My orders have always been correct and the food has always been cooked to perfection. This is one of my favorite have to grab a quick bite to eat places to stop. 
I've been a loyal customer for over 10 years. The only reason why I took a star off, is simply because I've never eaten inside and have not been able to see the cleanliness, but the food is so good that that's one of those times I just don't want to think about it."}
{"text":"Ive wanting to eat lunch here for a while. After pulling up to this horribly accessible location I parked on the side where I noticed one of the workers outside by the dumpster smoking a cigarette with his serving gloves on. I dont want my food to be tainted by disgusting cigarettes! 
I left!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean and well lit! The staff was very friendly and the food was good! I got the country style fish with corn and green beans! As always the corn and green beans are the best part of my meal here!! I get the fish just to have some protein!"}
{"text":"Ah... Captain D's...Quite torn since this place falls into limbo land in my classification of \"fast\" food and sit down.  Probably more leaning to the fast food side... you do come in, order at a counter, and the food is brought out to you... but it's not your normal burger and fries type fast place, it's seafood.  And if there is one thing you don't want to rush is the cooking of seafood (definitely don't' want to get sick on account of hasty cooking).

This place also does have a drive thru.... so I'm just going to give up the debate and call it fast food.  I've only dined in in most of my experiences here, but I recently went thru the drive through, and it wasn't that bad.  It's not  your typical drive through since you end up waiting a few minutes and the drive around gets a bit backed up.  I like the fact that you don't have to get out of your car... but you do burn a lot of gas just parked along side of the building [ I ended up turning my engine off for a few minutes ].

Mostly everything they offer here is deep fried.  So gurd your arteries here... it is fish, so the protien is probably better for you than a normal beef patty, but the batter doesn't give a strong case to making it any healthier than that.  Sides include:  hush puppies, fries, and cole slaw...

The staff is very nice and depending on how slammed the dining room is, there can be a wait sometimes.  Nice assortment of sauces to chose from, tarter, malt vinegar... and dip to your hearts delight (or fright - depending on how much you consume)."}
