{"text":"Great little cafe with plenty of selections. Salad options are great and reasonably priced too.

No wonder my coworkers always come here. 

Friday's special is Wonton soup. Their soups sell out fast."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is popular with the people who work in the nearby office buildings. They make good sandwiches and have daily specials too. The staff work quick to get the food and I like sitting in the quiet environment. They also have good baked goods and coffee if you're on the run."}
{"text":"Seems like a lot of people working in the surrounding business buildings comes here to pick up a coffee, a quick bite and some sweets.

The interior is surprisingly well decorated and love those armchairs if one want to chill a little.

No free parking, so I doubt I would come here much unless I have some business to attend in those offices and business."}
