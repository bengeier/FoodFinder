{"text":"By far the best Greek food I have ever tasted! The portion sizes are huge, staff are incredibly nice and upbeat. Absolutely love walking in there and being greeted with a big hello. The food is always so fresh and hot to order. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Thanks to that plate of food i just swallowed up,  my new yr resolution (going on a diet) went out the window!  The plate was bigger than my head.

To be honest, i was a bit afraid of actually not being able to finish that.  But, who am i kidding... couple of bits into it, i couldn't stop eating.  We ordered the chicken yeero dinner with rice and potatoes and a pork pita with greek  fries.  

The pork was actually better tasting than the chicken was.  Which is not usually the case.  The fries needed some work.  It was, fries... nothing exciting at all.  It was actually a bit weak.  They need to make the fries more crispy.  Same with the potatoes... they need to spice that up as well. 

All in all,  food was pretty good.  Dinner was just under $30 for two and i was pretty full. 

Will i come back... definitely!!!"}
{"text":"Greek Brothers is a casual restaurant where you order and get your food at the counter before taking a seat (if you're dining in). The food here is actually pretty good, and the portions are super generous. We ordered a chicken and pork yeero dinner, which came with a salad, pita bread, tzatziki and a choice of two sides (we chose potatoes and rice) - it was definitely more than enough food! Everything tasted great except for the potatoes, which were cooked in a tomato sauce that I wasn't a fan of. But after a seemingly good meal, we were really thirsty for the entire night. I have no idea which part of the meal made us so thirsty but it was very unpleasant and I would think twice before coming back here."}
{"text":"I was really interested in trying out this place, and as someone who doesn't eat red meat, I knew my only option there would be the chicken. As I was waiting in line, I saw the chicken and pork (yeero & souvlaki) get heated together on the flat top grill, touched with the same utensils,  etc. That was very unappetizing to me and I left. I wish restaurants were more mindful of food separation and cross-contamination. Plenty of people have food restrictions for many different reasons, and it would be nice to see more consideration for that."}
{"text":"If you want real authentic Gyro on a pita...you have to try this place. Putting fries in the Gyro is brilliant!"}
{"text":"Consistently good gyros that come in big portions. A little too oily at times but hey that's what it makes yummy right. Looks to be family run which is nice."}
{"text":"Not really that good had the chicken Greek salad wasn't that bad the chicken had a lot of flavour but the chicken wrap is really small for $12 with a drink in my opinion you definitely need two to be ok."}
{"text":"Chicken Pita was dry and tasteless.  It had a funny taste,  it had to be day old. Tzaziki was less than desired for the flavour. Needless to say, I won't be returning ."}
{"text":"Fabulous new Greek QSR. You can grab lunch here for about $10. The gyros are full of meat and their spicy tazikki (spelling?) is awesome. Happy I found this place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Foods amazing, but service is horrible. I would never go back just cause of the service."}
{"text":"Much ado about nothing and the customer service is atrocious! The food is just \"ok\" and the portions have gradually become smaller.

What makes this review turn for the worst is what followed however. I was having lunch with a colleague when a gentleman ordered a Chicken souvlaki on a pita. As he was going through the toppings, the owner (kid with a beard) told him he could not have cucumber or salad on it. After the client volunteered to pay extra, he still refused to give the paying customer what he wanted. Now, the client was polite and soft spoken, the owner became belligerent after the client said fine, he didn't want it any longer and simply walked away without having further confrontation. However, the owner said he was expletive stupid and slammed the pita into the garbage. It was incredible to see a business owner treat his clients in this fashion, and from what I have discovered, it is not the first time this place has treated clients this way. I'm from the service industry, and I will tell you this behavior is simply unacceptable by any stretch. I must say, this owner has peas for brains because there were a few people eating watching him act so obnoxious and rude. He lost more than one customer that very day."}
{"text":"Service was fine but have to go back to find out why the 4 star average. Nothing really to complain about but wasn't too impressed overall. Much better than the runned down Mr Greek down the road."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on here I was excited that Vaughan has an authentic Greek place.. However, it was a disappointment comparison to Greek food in Greek town.. I got the chicken gyros and husband the pork gyros,  both were bland and way to greasy/fatty and so were the fries..if you ask for Greek fries you barely get any feta cheese on it. The salad was dry and barely any dressing in it. Won't come here again, rather go to Messinis at the danforth or even Jimmy the Greek or Mr Greek express at Vaughan Mills."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, it's only a matter of time before they are a chain.  Great food and love the selection!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but service is horrible. When I ordered a cup of water, the person who I thought was the owner got upset and asked me to buy a bottle and when I refused, he told me that I can't do that and \"if I really wanted water, I would have to pay for it, nothing is free in life\". He then proceeded to charge me 25Â¢ for the cup.

That is not the way a successful business should be run. What a disrespectful way to treat a first-time customer. I won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the owners behind the counter has a real attitude problem.  If you are a regular you know the guy I'm talking about. He has a soup nazi mentality (Seinfeld). If you think you will be in the service industry and get away with Yelling at a customer you are sadly mistaken! Put this angry, ugly guy in the back! Last time I'm going there after being a loyal customer 2 times a week for 3 years..."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about greek brothers and read all the reviews here.  I trekked out to woodbridge anticipating a good gyros dinner with some good greek salad.  I was fairly hungry as i was doing a 3pm lunch.  Fairly disappointing food, even the tzatziki was not authentic at all.  2/10 only because salad was mediocre.  Meat was fatty and greasy and potatoes for sweet tasting.
The portion was huge but i could not eat the rice as the sweet sauce from stewed potatoes covered the rice. 
Staff was friendly and the lady warned me i would be addicted.  
I am not sure who is rating the food to be amazing as you can get way way better gyros in greektown. 
I was hoping for a good greek joint but i am afraid in my opinion this place was not good at all."}
{"text":"Visited here for first time after hearing about it for a few years.  Started with a big lineup so that's always a good sign.  Ordered the pork souvlaki with salad rice and potatoes.  The meat was dry, not the best seasoning either.  Saw them taking chicken skewers out of a box to grill i guess they don't make their own.  Salad was ok.  Potatoes not the traditional unpeeled potatoes with the lovely sauce...they were dry.  The rice was tasty and ok.   Overall not bad but not great."}
{"text":"This place I like supporting because they make quality food for a decent price. My go-to is always the spicy gyro wrap.

The gyro wrap is just my favorite here, better than Jimmy the Greek or Mr. Greek, it tastes more REAL, and doesn't look like dry shriveled carvings of rubber. I prefer this just because I like the flavors better than souvlaki and its more juicy. The only critique I have of the wrap is that although its super fatty and juicy and oily, it somehow is dry to me. I think it's because of the thick wrap and the added fries for starch. Maybe a saucier sauce would help? Other than that, it's great. 

The price is just a bit high for me. It's about $9 something for the wrap, whereas if you were to go to Mr. Zagros for a wrap, for an extra dollar, you get almost double the amount. But I know those two are different places, but the food is similar ish. If you do wanna get your bang for the buck, and if you're super hungry, Mr. Zagros for the portion. Here if you want the gyro meat that isn't shriveled looking rubber."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is a fast food but the quality is way better than other Greek fast food chains. I got the chicken gyro dinner and my husband got the pork gyro in pita. The chicken was very tasty. The side of roasted potatoes had an orange-colored sauce and were cooked perfectly. They drizzle the sauce on the rice as well. The salad that came with the dinner had a generous amount of feta unlike other fast food chains. The pork gyro was well-seasoned with fries inside the pita. The spicy tahini provided a great kick. We were so satisfied that we took some stuff home for our 2 teenagers and they loved the food as well. We will be back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go here the food is absolutely delicious! I am a huge fan of the red sauce that they put on the potatoes! Their Chicken Yeeros and Chicken Slouvaki is amazing! My boyfriend and I go here all the time! I suggest this place if you are ever around the area!!!"}
{"text":"Very filling chicken gyro. Spicy tzatziki was a nice change. Liked the addition of French Fries as well."}
{"text":"Amazing pita wrap,  chicken is very crispy and flavourful, option for spicy or regular tzatziki sauce, both are good. 

New owners as of couple months ago, great guy. 

Couple TV's which is nice.  Was able to watch the soccer game."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had! Really good deal for the portions and quality of ingredients! I will definitely keep coming back to this place when I'm in the area (I.e. when I head to Vaughan mills!) I had the chicken yeero and Greek fries - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I didn't like the food the service was terrible... They think their the only Greek place in town I guess. They didn't have any pork souvlaki at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.....hmmmmm....ill take Zets over this crap !!! Never going back!!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to check this place out. I had heard really good things about there Poutine. As I was in the area, I thought might as well try it. 

It's a small location, with fair amount of seats to sit. As I got in, there's a pretty big menu located near the register that has all the options available. I knew what I came to try, so I ordered Greek Brothers Poutine \"The Davide\". Which comes with fries, your choice of meat, feta cheese, tzatziki sauce and your level of spice. 

I paid about $10, it is a really big portion that really stuffs you up. The Poutine was hands done amazing! It had the perfect amount of tzatziki sauce. The only thing I personally didn't like was the feta cheese, I found that it tasted very salty with that. Next time I'll just not add that. 

But if you guys haven't tried it before, make sure you do. The Poutine was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my work, so I usually go once a week for takeout.  It is HEAD AND SHOULDERS above any Mr. Greek or Opa.  It puts them to shame.  It's a smallish looking place in a strip plaza, but there's actually quite a fair amount of seating. It's very clean.  There is usually a long line up to the door at lunch time, but it goes quickly.  I refer to the two brothers who run the place as the \"souvlaki nazi's\"  If you are in the line and they ask what you want and you don't know, they will take the next person behind you until you make a decision.  It's ok.. we know the drill now so we already know what we want when we are asked.  I have had the Chicken souvlaki pita.. comes with regular or spicy tzatziki, onion, tomato and french fries.. yes french fries ON the pita.. you would be amazed at what the fries add to the pita.. so yummy! They put 2 huge skewers of chicken on and wrap it up. The chicken is the most delicious, moist chicken I have ever had on a pita. It's not easy to eat..keep it wrapped up while you eat it, if you unwrap it you will have a mess on your hands (and everywhere else)  I've also had the chicken souvlaki greek salad.  Huge and fresh and lovely. They don't skimp on olives or feta. I always ask for a little extra vinaigrette.  The prices are reasonable and you get more than enough food. I highly recommend this place for lunch! I see some reviewers complaining about the service, but when you go there regularly they really warm up to you, it's not that they are rude, they are just business like and efficient, and they have never given me a problem if I ask for lettuce on my pita or extra this or that..."}
{"text":"Best chicken yeeros! Went in for the first time after reading many positive reviews on Yelp and and it did not disappoint! Everything tasted fresh and delicious, including the chicken yeeros, rice, potatoes and salad! Will most definitely be returning and will highly recommend to friends and family!"}
{"text":"First time and it was great.  Fresh and crispy salad, chicken souvlaki was juicy and delicious.  They don't give an option to get more Salad with only one side with the dinner.  We instead ended up ordering a chicken souvlaki and salad, then got a small side of half rice and half potatoes.  Pita doesn't come with the Chicken and salad, for $ 1.00 more can get a pita. 
Will be back for sure, good service, reasonable prices, great food and clean establishment."}
{"text":"I'm usually not into Greek food but these guys were exceptional. Great customer service, advised me on the portions. Food was juicy and full of flavor. Their spicy tzatziki was defiantly different. Their poutine was a great portion and filling. Place was clean. No complaints at all. Defiantly would go back next time I want Greek food. If your looking for Greek food, defiantly advise to go here."}
{"text":"Great spot.

Yeero was great and had fries in it like I have been told you see in Greece by friends which was a delight to try. 

I also tried the greek fries which was priced well and very tasty. 

I am a new regular customer."}
{"text":"After spending a week in Greece this place is very legit. 

I always get the chicken or pork yero dinner and it's about $13.00 including tax. I get 2 meals out of this if I make it last. 

Try the Greek poutine with feta and tazaki , very good!!!! 

One of the best in Vaughan"}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant because it was a halfway point between my bf and my location and had a good rating. When I arrived 10 minutes earlier I started yelping around me and found a popular Italian hot table around the corner... when the bf arrived I was so tempted to switch the dinner place but glad I didn't. (ITALIAN PLACE YOU CAN WAIT TIL NEXT TIME)

We took awhile to actually meet up since there was two entrances and we were coming from the east and west. Finally after getting out of the cold we ordered a chicken souvlaki pita, chicken gyro wrap and greek fries. While the two chefs behind the counter was putting our food together (freshly cutting the meat off and putting them on the grill) we all had a fun conversation. The service brought it up for me, they were playful and made our date a bit more fun! 

The chicken souvlaki came with two huge skewers of chicken breast which was rare among fast food greek places. My gyro was unfortunately a bit dry, I'm thinking cause the meat was cooking for awhile before we came around. But it was loaded with a lot of meat! The pitas came with fresh fries in the sandwich which added a nice crunchy texture and a first for me. The greek fries are just feta cheese and olive oil over fresh fries, I probably wouldn't have ordered them if I knew I was getting fries in my sandwich. 

All in all it was a good stop over (not going to drive from mississauga west) and the service was great! Even as we were leaving we all said good byes."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure what the fascination of this place is I was extremely excited to try this based on the previous reviews. I ordered the pork dinner Gyro I would say at least 35% of meat was filled with fat that I did not eat and there was a lot of grease as well left over after the meal on my tray. The potatoes were excellent however the rice was very bland... I left hungry and wishing I went elsewhere. The people were also extremely rude as I walked in and out with a hello or goodbye."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy the food at this restaurant. However, my dining experience is never pleasant. Out of the 4-5 times I have been here, this has happened twice. The last times I went one of the young men (the one with the beard) putting my plate together yelled at the man who's cooking right behind him. He literally yells at him in front of all the customers and it's humiliating. Despite those two bad experiences, I really enjoy the food, the price and the portions."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Spacious. Greek inspired
Cleanliness: Really clean. 
Constructive criticism: Could stand to use more Greek decor or color. But i understand as this is not a fine dining restaurant. This is a quick eatery. (maybe im just being picky).
Cuisine: Greek!
Facilities: N/A
Food: Very good. Fresh, and tasty. Excellent quality. Try the Greek fries! they are out of this world! I also had the Greek Chicken salad. I substituted the Chicken skewer for the Chicken Souvlaki on the rotating spitt. This was much tastier and fresher!
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Frequent customer - has already reccomended.
Parking: Private
Portion Sizes: Large. You wont be hungry when you're finished! Satisfaction Guaranteed
Price: Fair. I paid $17.95 for my salad and fries. A little steep for salad and fries, but great quality. 
Service: Friendly. Especialy the lady at the cash. Quick service and attentive.
Selection: wide variety. Although, i was disapointed when i didn't see the Saganaki (friend cheese) on the menu. This is a classic Greek staple.

{"text":"Best greek food I've ever had. Meat was tasty and fresh along the rice and potatoes. So glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  The food was delicious overall.  Specifically the salad, tzatziki, pita, potatoes and fries.  

The Gyro was super greasy and fatty.  Nothing like the Gyro I have ever had in other Canadian restaurants, Greece, or the US.  They spell it yeero, which was all new to me.  That's definitely how it is pronounced but not spelled.  After all - it comes from the word \"gyro\" which means to rotate or spin.

As I said it was greasy, and super fatty.  It's also pork and not lamb.  Don't expect the thin slices stops you normally find worldwide.  This is tiny pierces of fatty, mixed meat.  None of us are it received a lecture on how \"this was the real gyro.\"  

I don't know.  My parents are Greek.  They own Greek restaurants.  I have eaten gyro in Greece.  None of what I have experienced matched what they served.

It appears folks really like it.  And that's great.  Just too creepy for us and not what we were expecting. And definitely did not need a lecture.  Save it for someone who doesn't know better or better yet, keep your opinion to yourself when the customer shares feedback."}
{"text":"Location - Good
Store Environment - Good
Service - Good
Menu - Small but Good
Food Quality - Good. 

One of the better tasting Greek restaurants I've been to. You can tell they take great care in what they do. 

The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is lack of vegetable options for those who don't want starch or carbs. That's it. But the rice and potatoes and fries look amazing so don't be turned off by it. 

Ingredients for salad were fresh, chicken was cooked through and seasoned nicely. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!
There yeero's are amazing...pork or chicken....really cool touch how they add fries inside.  But wow do they stuff it with meat.  It's like another meal with the meat that falls out of it.  And its tasty!  

Staff is very friendly, after coming in twice, they all remember who you are.  Always talking joking around.  

Price..you cannot beat the price.  6 bucks for a loaded yeero/gyro.  seriously, a big mac costs more!

Cons: can't think of any.   You come here for a quick bite, your not looking for date night.  Eat and go.   All that matters is the food, and that is no problem here"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The staff there was super friendly, kept is laughing the entire time. My boyfriend and I ordered two Greek poutines and the man behind the counter asked us if we wanted to get one instead to share since the portion is huge. It was nice that he told us about that before having us pay for two enormous portions. The service was speedy and the food was incredible. Will definitely be going back to this little hidden gem and trying something new!"}
{"text":"I see the really amazing hardworking people here, I see the time and effort they put in the food and I can 100 percent taste it. The portions are amazing and I usually can never finish it. I've never had one problem with the service or the food, they don't give me a dirty look when it comes to giving me a water cup and they sure as hell don't skimp on the meat. 
I would love to come here more unfortunately my wallet doesn't allow me to do so  but honestly an amazing place to eat and I have been back and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"There is lots of seating and the place is relatively clean. The serves was very friendly. 
I am not a fan of greek food, but I had a chicken gryos and it was made with lots of tasty chicken and a soft pita with my choice of toppings. It was enjoyable very filling. 
I would go back when I crave a gryo again."}
{"text":"Got the chicken gyro dinner, and wasnt impressed.  The chicken is not freshly cut off the gyro spit when you order, and is instead kept in a warming box and i guess every so often cut off.  This is not authentic, because you do not get crispy meat but rather a chewy mess.

The WORST part! I had a piece of chicken cartiledge in my food which is the grossesst thing ever!!! Eww

Only reason i'll give it 2 stars is because the portions are pretty decent and the rice and potatoes were pretty good, but then again it taste just like jimmy the greek..."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious food! Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots. Love the spicy tzatziki!"}
{"text":"Seriously good authentic jeero at a reasonable price, with huge portions. The only way I shovelled that whole jeero dinner in my face was by not having eaten anything for lunch. 

They are quick and friendly, the tzatziki is awesomely garlicky, and thick. The portions are huge, which is great because this stuff is amazing to the taste buds. My personal preference was the chicken over the pork, but both are good and juicy. The roasted potatoes are nice, the sauce was delicious, and I liked that they threw extra on to the rice."}
{"text":"Had the chicken souvlaki pita with spicy tziki and french fries. Was blown away! Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Food was really good, the guys working in there are great. Got two chicken souvlaki meals with rice. The Greek fries weren't great, they just pour the Greek salad dressing on them. It's super oily, would have been better with tzaziki. Wouldn't order those again but the souvlaki was great, their tzaziki is amazing, especially the spicy one. The restaurant has a few tables but seems more like a takeout place. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Gyro places in town!

The portions they serve here are very generous. A gyro itself will put you in a food coma instantly. They literally stuff as much meat as they can in the gyro without it breaking apart. This is what makes the place so good! 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is in Vaughan!"}
{"text":"Great Greek food. They give you plenty of meat and their pitas are amazing. 

Just be precise on your ordering as they talk fast, but whatever you do get. Will be great!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star

I like Sandwich that is packed with Meat! Oh so delicious meat!   

Here at The Greek Brothers you can find traditional Greek Sandwich Yeero which is really Gyros packed with either Pork or Chicken or both at a reasonable price.

My Pork Yeero ($5.91) was juicy and well flavoured! Top with Spicy Tzatziki, Tomato, Onion and Fries!   

Service here is fast and friendly. 

There is also dinner portion if you want something more substantial. But their sandwich is great as a quiet lunch option!"}
{"text":"UGH GREEK FOOD!

Went with my mom who now if officially my food date every Friday. We went to Greek Brothers because we were in the mood for not only Greek food, but for a quick meal and this is the place!

I ordered the Pork Gyro with a side of DELICIOUS feta fries while my mom ordered the Chicken Gyro on a pita. Great food, freshly made, and not expensive (total around $25 for the whole meal).

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with adorable posters, paintings and sarcastic, satirical sayings like 'go greek once a week'

5 Burps out of 5"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their gyros are amazing. The staff is fast and courteous. Food is always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a packed weekend that had a line towards the door.  It's crazy how busy they are during their peak times but stay strapped in because it's totally worth it for the wait.  Family owned business so they're super nice, not the most cleanest of places but it's cool.  

Definitely try out the Chicken souvlaki pita as it was amazing.  The seasoning of the chicken is mouthwatering and all the ingredients are very minimal and feel very whole.  I got full eating this meal with fries and I usually don't get full eating out at fast casual places! The fries were cool, nothing fancy but I would try out the greek fries next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"After reading about Greek Brothers for quite some time I decided to give it a try and I was really impressed. Normally with 'fast' Greek places, I expect a taste similar to mall Greek food or the dreaded Mr. Greek (express). 

This was much much much better! The gyros were really juicy and the toppings were all fresh. What put this place over the top was the spicy tzatziki which was amazing and generously applied.

My one knock would be the menu is a bit confusing. I was unsure how many sides you got if you made it into a combo. Turns out its one side, I opted for fries which were good and plentiful. I'd like to have 2 sides of half portions, I didn't ask, maybe this is possible(?). This isn't enough to knock a star off. 

I'll be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Been a while since my last visit to the Infamous Greek Bros house. Today, I was craving that old Pita I had chock full of tasty Tzaziki and meat. Walked in, same table and decor as years ago, nothing changed. I ordered the Pork Souvlaki, It's a Greek staple and a sure bet, so I thought.

Took a bite and was left wondering what happened to the flavor? It truly tasted of bland meat and yogurt, Shouldn't the Tzaziki have some garlic and onion in it, meat seasoned and not dry? I mean, these \"Brothers\" charge premium prices for their food, why should I go here when I can get better at any Mr Greek?

As I Looked around, I started to notice the cleanliness...so off on my rant which this place did not disappoint, Kitchen floors were filthy, you could see the stainless appliances and kitchen fans were smeared not cleaned. They kept touching the same garbage bin behind the counter where they toss the sticks. Peeking into the back kitchen, more of the same dirt and smears on everything. Bathroom door lock was busted and overall upkeep minimal. There was plenty of black dirt which was stuck to the tile everywhere, way along the boarders of the tile due to minimal cleaning effort in this area...Our health is at stake here, I'm no longer accepting because you got a pass it's Okay to not clean and make sure get sick!!

I did not experience the poor attitude that my fellow yelpers seem to have mentioned in their reviews, that being said, conversation was minimal, I ordered, waited and went to the table, no small talk whatsoever.

I found out this place underwent an ownership change since may last visit, this may explain the differences in the food."}
{"text":"Usually come here with my buds when were craving it. Great services, amazing food! I etheir get the mixed dinner or pork dinner."}
{"text":"I'm writing about the atrocious customer service (or complete lack of there of) I received at Greek Brothers. 

I dined in today with my coworkers for lunch. Food was quite average - rice was particularly bland. In my opinion Jimmy the Greek at Vaughan Mills tastes better and is cheaper.

I couldn't finish my food so I wanted to get a takeout container. I went to the front counter and the lady said I could use their flimsy clear pastry sized take-out container - same ones they use to package their baklava. I had quite a bit of food left over so those containers were not ideal and also I see a lot of ppl getting takeout and there's no way they're getting it packed with these small flimsy containers. On my way back I notice round takeout containers at the food service area of the line which were more suited to be used as takeout so I reach for it only to be yelled at by the man with the beard \"EXCUSE ME, YOU CAN'T TAKE THESE CONTAINERS, PUT THEM BACK!!!', he then proceeded to scream expletives at me. I was completely taken aback at the confrontational nature of this food service worker and didn't want to escalate  the situation so put back the container and went to sit back down. As a paying customer I had already spent $20 for a water, dinner plate and a baklava and you can't be bothered to let me use a round container?! WOW Who are you? Guardian of food containers?

A customer from another table who was watching and who unfortunately  was also yelled at by the man before spoke up and told the individual with the beard that he  was being extremely rude and that he can explain things nicely next time. But the bearded guy just doesn't know when to stop and kept arguing back and continued to make a big fuss about the situation so everyone in the restaurant could hear, even though, mind you, at this point I had already put the round takeout containers back. Clearly this indiviudal had nothing better going on in his life than to try and start fights over petty things, such as a container.

From reading some of the other reviews here it appears my experience isn't a one off and they don't value their customers at all. I will never return - why would I pay for overpriced food court calibre food only to be yelled at?! No thanks."}
{"text":"Solid Greek food. I had the chicken souvlaki and a salad to go. The salad's ingredients were obviously fresh and high quality (esp. compared to franchised Greek restaurants), the chicken was well spiced, and the spicy tzatziki to go with it was great. The service was also very friendly. The workers behind the counter were very polite and precise with my order; reminding me about certain options I had forgot to bring up. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience and would rate this establishment 4 stars - only knocking off a star because the price was slightly higher than what I expected for what essentially amounts to Greek fast food. 

Next lunch I'm in the mood for Greek food, I will definitely check this place out again!

Updating to say that during my second experience, the chicken souvlaki was somewhat dry. Not sure how consistent the quality is here."}
{"text":"Amazing and fast! Family ran express style spot.  Service with pride and a smile. I deconstruct recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Greek.  It's so authentic they didn't even let my girlfriend ruin her gyro with lettuce. Traditional only!"}
{"text":"Don't see the hype. It's basic Greek food. Nothing special here guys. Honestly. Staff are rude. I can contest to that from my personal experience. The food is also very greasy and oily, can't say I would come back here. 

This is absolutely not the best Greek food lol. People are hyping It up way more than it should be. Don't come here with high hopes, you will be disappointed. 

One yelper said she received a lecture on how \"yeero\" is the real thing and gyro is not, blah blah blah. I unfortunately sat through that same lecture. Lol.  They took offence when I asked for GYRO and told me that it's crap and they don't serve it. They serve the \"real thing\". Far from it bud. The two brothers or cousins, whatever they are, working behind the counter are enough to keep me away from this place. Never again."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town. Always get the chicken yeero, the pork is ok but I love the chicken. The plate comes with the chicken yeero( similar to shawarma style chicken) a toasted pita, a Greek salad with fresh crunchy romaine lettuce, Greek style rice, roasted potatoes in the tomato sauce( so good) they even pour the sauce on the rice for you so you get the extra flavour. Then you choose your tzatziki - regular or spicy. You have to do spicy all the way! The chicken is fresh to order, the cut it off when you ask for it. It's seasoned perfectly and is heaven when you have it with that spicy tzatziki. The portions are really fair and I've never left this place feeling hungry. At around $12 it's a good deal. 

Also try the Greek fries, fresh fried fries with a bunch of feta dumped on it with Greek dressing - simple but amazing.

I've been here at least ten times over the course of the past 2 years and it has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"So much hype and so much anticipation!  Meh...wasn't what I was expecting.
The YEEROS as they have posted on their menus - phoentically correct but most of us have grown up with the GYROS spelling.  We just pronounce it with a silent G when speaking to Greeks - we really didn't need a lesson and history on the meat.  Though interesting to learn.
For those of you that grew up with GYROS and DONAIRS - processed and packed meats on a rotating burner, it is not the same here.  For those of you who grew up with Shawarmas, it is similar.  The YEEROS here are bits of meats and not long strips.  There are pork and chicken yeeros.
I had the pork yeeros dinner with rice and potatos.  The bits of pork were abundant but was quite greasy.  There was a hefty amount of it pooled at the bottom of the plate on top of the paper liner.  The bits were salty and not all that tasty.  The potato and rice was good and the a fresh salad is always nice to have.

Maybe I'm too conditioned by Greek Town on the Danforth.  This place was maybe too traditional greek for me!?!  At $16 for a dinner and a drink, it's a little expensive for such an experience.

2.5 stars for me.
Cheers...ER...OPA!"}
