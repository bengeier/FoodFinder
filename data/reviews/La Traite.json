{"text":"Except for the old-school LED ticker above it, La Traite looks an unassuming Belle Province knock-off. To be fair, they do specialize in the same greasy spoon staples like fries, burgers and hot-dogs, and the open-kitchen layout has more than a passing resemblance to the diner chain's. The food is about as solid as you'd expect from a great diner, but the real kicker here is the breakfast. Their big breakfast plate is to be reckoned with, and their French toast is really good. An excellent diner experience."}
{"text":"Breakfast - this nice diner makes a pretty fine brekkie.  I had the supreme omelette, and it was actually very good.  Service was great, and the diner itself is very clean, good atmosphere.  Was not busy at all during Sunday morning brunch.  While not the most *amazing* breakfast EVER - it was a pretty good spot, and I would gladly go back again.  Happy with the food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Huge portion of fries, good simple burger, good ambience, very fair price, ONE HAPPY CUSTOMER!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now and it's still just meh. Great staff, lovely restaurant (very clean, spacious, and well lit), good prices, big portions.   It had all the ingredients to be a 5 star in my book but the food is just so bleh. The fries and onion rings taste very oily, the meat in the burgers tastes the same as frozen patties from Costco, and the hot dogs are forgettable.   This place has a typical dinner vibe but I've had better than what they offer here.  It's a real shame."}
{"text":"I went to La Traite for a late breakfast after a long Saturday night prior.   We were literally the only people in the place. It was nice and clean and everything seemed really well kept. A nice little classic diner feel to it.  I ordered a classic bacon and eggs breakfast. Took a bit longer than I had expected for the food, maybe about 15 minutes. Most likely because everything was being made fresh since we were the only table of customers.   Breakfast came with some nice extras. A side of beans and a slice of orange and honeydew melon. My major complaint about the food was that I asked for my bacon extra crispy and it was anything but. Very floppy. So much so that I didn't eat much which was too bad because they give you quite a bit. Four strips! The eggs were prepared perfectly though (over easy).  Overall, great value and lots of food. A bit slow on service and an unfortunate \"bacon experience\" make it a 3 star with potential to hit 4 (maybe even 5) star rating."}
{"text":"I had a poutine at La Traite. It was yummy and the price was reasonable. The staff was very accommodating and served the food very quickly. If you're looking for a poutine, go to this restaurant. You'll eat delicious one!"}
{"text":"First of all I was VERY impresses with the way the staff was able to easily switch between French and English for the different needs of out group. No breaks or misunderstandings; just to the point business.  The food came out fast, though they did set the fries on the tray well before the burgers were done; so they were not as hot and crisp as I would prefer. However, there were A TON of the fries. My carb low light was quickly extinguished!  The smoked meat sandwich (viande fumee) was piled high with meat, pickle, mustard on rye bread. The smoked meat (beef) was very tender and was closer to a pastrami flavor than a strong beef flavor. Still very good though. The mustard really married the flavors of the sandwich.  The hamburger was a basic grill flavor with a myriad of accruements as toppings as standard. Good flavor, but not fancy.  I would return again."}
{"text":"6 février 2013 Au détour d'un coin de rue, Bleury et Mayor, je tombe sur un petit trésor de snack-bar qui ressemble, en apparence, à tous les Belle Province. Et pourtant, en entrant, on sent bien la bonne odeur de la frite fraîche doublement cuite traditionnelle. On découvre les spéciaux trios hot-dogs, frites, boissons, etc... Et sans oublier le Club sandwich. Je choisis donc le Club ! Portions généreuses, et surtout la salade de choux .... enfin ! une salade de choux préparée de la bonne façon : assaisonnement fin, pas de liquide surnageant, une arôme marinée. Pour la première fois, je goûte à la vraie bonne salade de choux. Vous n'aurez jamais vu un cuisinier couper un Club comme il le fait devant vous ! Des coups de couteaux clairs, nets et chirurgicaux.  L'endroit est très accueillant, bien ordonnée, bien éclairée, décoré d'écran où on vous présente la dernière partie de hockey avec écriteau géant à l'extérieur sur lequel on lit les derniers résultats du Canadiens. L'endroit était occupé, jadis, par le magasin de fourrures Hercules.  February 6th 2013 On a hidden corner, Bleury and Mayor, I find a small treasure of a snack-bar, looks like any Belle Province, but it's not. Once you step in, you can smell the rich enticing odour of doubly cooked fresh french fries, traditionnal way. On the menu, usual trios, hot-dogs, cola, fries, etc... Don't forget the Club Sandwich. I pick the Club ! Generous portions and don't forget the savory coleslaw made the perfect way for clubs : mildly seasonned, not watery, sweet marinated aroma. For the first time, I taste a real coleslaw made for club sandwich. You've never seen a cook cut a Club like he will do it in front of you ! Clear knife cut, clean and surgery-like.  The place is well maintained, well lit, nice deco, sports screens with an outside screen band indicating the latest hockey score. The place was a fur store, before, called Hercules furs."}
