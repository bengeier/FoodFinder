{"text":"1st round:   \"Donald Trump Taco\" lots of tongue with no brain... (see round 3)  \"Bavette\" (Arrachera)= 90% a touch on the dry side, but regardless, full of flavor;  \"Contre-Filet\" (Bistec)= 95% really  C really good.  Round 2:   \"Longaniza\" (agárrame confianza!) solid 95%, specially with the fries wall centred with coriander, onion and double tortilla!  Round 3:  The infamous \"DT (tongue) Taco\"= 100%. Truly amazing prep, just for  connoseurs!  Friendly staff, nice urban deco, stand up concept, just like in Mexico!  All in all, an dream addition to the taco offering on the island. Made rememberu the \"Chupacabras Taco Stand\", that good! ;o)"}
{"text":"Luv this place, luv the people who work here, the concept the food, everything, perfection. I love the extra hot sauce, the torture it brings is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love tacos and I love these tacos! They are HUGE! I had the chorizo and the shrimp and loved both. The sauces were also amazing and a must! I have never had french fries on a taco but it worked. I will be back."}
{"text":"Meh.  The tacos are too expensive, and I don't understand the french fries served on them.   I would have to disagree with the previous review, one taco doesn't make a meal.  I had their Tamarind drink as well. It was very underwhelming.  Sorry but $6.00 for a taco is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Meh. Almost walked out wen i saw the prices... 6$/taco are you kidding me? They are bigger than average and stacked with french fries (??) i guess. Meat (i had bavette and shrimp) didnt taste like much, french fries kinda ruin it. Horchata was a flop as well; tiny plastic glass and very watered down. Not going back..."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! $6 seems like a lot for a taco, but they are big. Great flavours, excellent salsa, this is worth a try."}
{"text":"Good tacos, a little dry, only very spicy salsas. Two tacos make a meal, one is not enough. That's $12 which is reasonable. Good drinks, but the portion was small. I don't totally understand the fries on the tacos, but hey, free fries! I'll be back, but I think I'd order the shrimp or the chorizo which were more moist than the beef. I'd love a truly mild salsa or the option of guacamole! The value is good which is why I'll be back."}
{"text":"After hearing a few rave reviews about this place from various friends, I finally tried these famous tacos and all I can really say is meh..  The fries are yummy but the tacos kinda taste like nothing. Had a beef and a veggie one and neither had much flavour. Not sure if the flavour is supposed to come from added hot sauce but I was hoping that the contents of the tacos would be marinated or flavoured somehow.  Anyways, not much to say. I see awesome reviews so maybe I came on an off day but I won't be returning unfortunately!"}
{"text":"This place became a favourite. Sure the choice is limited, but we can't get enough of Victor's tasty tacos.  For 6$ you get a taco with fries. Everything was tasty (sauces included)! I eat a lot and two tacos are a lot for me.  Plus the owner and staff are super friendly with us."}
{"text":"Victor is the Taco Boss!!!! Extremely juicy tacos with fries in the mix... It was literally food sex with every last bite.. And now I'm craving another dose!!"}
{"text":"C'est assez bien, tu as un énorme giga tacos pour 6$ avec des frites qui goûtent comme les frites maison de ta mère. Il y a seulement un choix végé avec des champignons; évidemment mon coeur aurait envie de leur dire \"faites-en plus...\". Hélas je devrai attendre... Leur ceviche est merveilleux une fois que tu rajoutes assez de jus de lime (nous avons rajouté une lime de plus!). Puis après, ça fond dans la bouche et on est au paradis du poisson cru. Leur différentes salsa fait maison sont de la bombe aussi."}
{"text":"Tacos Victor isn't the best. They put French fries in their tacos and that's just whack. They've got a dearth of vegetarian selection. The French fry/bland Métro market Saputo plastic mozzarella/mushroom taco is unpleasantly stodgy. People of the world ! hear me with your heart of hearts when I say to you that, I, your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man doth love and respect the French fry as well as the taco ... but never, ever, should the twain meet. French fry is French fry and taco is taco and never shall the twain meet again in my mouth ever; fo' 'eva'eva. The horchata was also meh. It was rather sweet and tasteless. I want more rice and more true cinnamon in my horchata. Anyway I'm going to hightail it on over to Taco Tijuana on Ouest Sherbs and Royal where the tacos are double the size and half the price! I gots to get my taco on full frontal."}
{"text":"Location: On Notre-Dame West. Street parking is available - I don't recall seeing meters, but I wasn't paying attention. The closest subway is probably St. Henri and you'd have to walk from there.  The place: It's tiny and meant to be more of a take-out joint then a sit-down place. They do have bar-type seating at the front with about 4 chairs. The two other counters don't have any seating so you'd have to stand. There's one tall chair and I was lucky enough to snag it because I'm quick like that.  The goods: I stopped in for a quick lunch and went with the shrimp taco. The shrimp were perfectly grilled and flavourful, served on two soft taco shells with fries on top (!). Cucumber, radish and cilantro were served on the side. I enjoyed the taco, and one was enough for me. The fries were great too! Now, pay attention when you go or you'll do like I did - totally miss the salsa and guacamole that's located right next to you when you pick up your order. Literally. It was RIGHT there.   Service: Friendly.  Price point: To me, $6 for a taco is expensive. Back in Vancouver, you'll pay about $3 for the same size but there's more variety in terms filling. That said, this place is a great place to stop in for a snack."}
{"text":"It is hard to find authentic and delicious tacos in Montreal. Taco Victor is near my place. I always passed by; and it is almost always packed.   Today, the day came for me to render a visit there with my sister(my food buddy). It's is tiny place; with high stools and tables, plus mini spot outside. We decided to sit outside. I placed my order, we got ceviche with pita, and three different tacos (bavette, chorizo and shrimp). Beside the cash counter, there are three large mortars with three types of sauces(mild, hot and very hot) for you to take in tiny little containers with your food plus with wedges of limes. The hot sauce was the best. Plus, we got non alcoholic sangria soda, Jarritos orange soda.   Finally, our orders were presented to us. What a delightful surprise, our tacos were sprinkled with French fries.   We bought our food outside. We devoured the food like animals. It was so good that I don't have words to describe. For my sister, it was the best tacos ever... and she is already asking me when are we coming back again."}
{"text":"Went here with my family upon a recommendation from a friend (who had yet to suggest a bad spot to me). It was really busy but we were served promptly.  We tried 5 of the 6 soft shell tacos on the menu, and liked all of them. The 3 salsa options of varying intensity were good.  After 5 tacos among the three of us we were pleasantly full, with no room for dessert... Definitely would go back..."}
{"text":"Tacos are dry, lacking so much seasoning no salsa or any kind of sauce, the soggy fries do not add anything to the taco, just not texturally appetizing.   This is my first one star rating for a mom and pops shop. It was my first time at victors and I asked the cashier for two of the best tacos. She ordered us the steak and pork, then the steak... First off why did you suggest TWO steaks!?! When I checked the bill and found out it was two steaks I asked for shrimp and instead of accommodating to a first time customer. The cook said no because he put the meats on the grill already and made it so difficult when I asked to pay to replace the steak. Why would you not make a new customer happy?? Their turnover is so quick that even if they didn't give the steak to me, someone right after me would order it.   Overall I will never return and the tacos f***ing sucked !"}
{"text":"This is probably my new fav taco place as the tacos are freshly made and so delicious. I had the shrimp and vegetarian ones and they were both full with flavours and tasted so good. The sauces on the side were my favourite. I also love the fact that they had fries on the tacos, add fries to any meal and you'd be a happy camper but on tacos; totally rocked this idea whoever had it :)"}
{"text":"Yummy and filling taco for $6.50. Not bad! The flavors were really good, the bavette and shrimp were cooked perfectly and I loved the 3 choice of sauces. It's a small place with counters where you can stand and eat, or 4 chairs to eat at inside. There are benches you can sit at outside the resto too. Cute & basic decor. Loving all of the Mexican options around the Sud-Ouest area!"}
{"text":"I hit this place twice already this week. If you're craving tacos, it's worth the drive, from wherever! They're that good and that's all they make!   NOTE: If you like tacos, with a twist (stuffed French Fries inside), you'll love these!   They are extremely fresh, tasty and cost effective! $6.50 per taco is extremely reasonable, especially for the shrimp or contre filet (beef)!  Very friendly staff, clean and cooked right in front of your eyes. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from NYC and I've never had tacos like this before. My friends and I visited Montreal for 3 days. We originally planned to go to Arthur's Nosh, but unfortunately it was closed. Our hunger forced us to walk around near our Airbnb place and we came across Tacos Victor. It was the best decision. We got the Campechanos and the Shrimp Tacos. A-mazing. Each bite had a burst of flavor, especially with the choice of 3 hot sauces. We actually ended our trip with Tacos Victor LOL. I'll miss this place.."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in Mtl! Finally, a restaurant that makes real Mexican tacos. Friendly, happy staff who are proud of their food"}
{"text":"k not bad but reason I'm giving one one star is cause it's all the hipsters there seem to like paying 6 bucks for a small okay taco with gross soggy fries on top (whhhhy). I went next door to Frida.  same thing for 2.50 and no stupid fries"}
{"text":"I do love my tacos but was disappointed in this place. Whereas the pricing is very reasonable, the tacos are 50% soggy french fry which is both odd and deceptive when you think you're getting a full taco. The tacos took a long time to prepare and in such a small place with alot of people waiting it gets a bit uncomfortable pretty quickly. They also double up on the tortillas also so between that and the mound of fries it lacks the flavor of the other ingredients."}
{"text":"For $6.50 you get an overstuffed soft shell taco with some fries. The ingredients are of great quality, the service is quick, and there are like 6 menu options total.  That being said, the fries should come on the side, the staff need to be more outgoing and ready to take customer orders, and the way they have their sauces displayed is (sadly) very unhygienic.  Would definitely stop by on a weekly basis for lunch if I worked nearby."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos!!just love the beef tacos. Not enough choices of meat but overall the tacos was to die for. I will definitely go again soon."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to come here because of the pictures that others posted: fries in tacos?? How can the taco taste any good?? I was wrong because the tacos are delicious here. Every Mexican knows that sauce is the key to a good taco - it brings out the soul of a taco and they have three authentic and delicious sauces for you to serve on your tacos.  Something that I would like to be able to do, is to separate the two tortillas and make two separate tacos with each serving. Kinda difficult to do if they're stuck together."}
{"text":"The tacos at this place are flavourful and the service is friendly. I can see that there are a few people here who are criticizing the price point and portion size but it worked well for me (and trust me when it comes to tacos I start to really identify with the \"bet you can't have just one\" mentality). I walked by and got 1 taco for 6 dollars with fries piled on top and it filled me right up on a hot summer day. The salsa is delicious and the menu is sparse because NEWSFLASH it's much easier and better to concentrate on making small delicious menu than to have a lot of choice but sacrifice quality.  I've brought several of my friends since and they have all exclaimed that it is the best taco they've ever had in the city. I don't know if I can say that (because of childhood allegiances - I think I may have a blood oath with another place), but it's the best one that I've had in St Henry and very high on the list!"}
{"text":"Good location; and nice decor. Little menu is very simple and doesn't explain much.  We ordered three tacos, shrimp, Bavette and carnitas. All very basic. They are served with soggy fries on top of them and cilantro, Not great but not horrible. The shrimp one was good but i chalk that up to the really good hot sauce/salsa you can choose from.  Hot and very hot were delicious.   Probably wouldn't go back.  Just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos. Great spicy salsa. Cool atmosphere. Perfect for a quick inexpensive eat!"}
{"text":"Tacos Victor, in concept, is a really great idea, and for all intents and purposes should be a really great place.  They keep it simple, focusing just on tacos with a few drinks, with awesome choices for cuts of meat (e.g. beef tongue, sirloin, and flap steak) and other proteins, but in the execution of everything together, the taco at the end of the day fell a little bit flat for me, especially for $6 CAD/portion.  Ironically though, I have no complaints about the meat!  I had the beef tongue taco when I stopped by and they gave me a decent-sized portion that was soft, tender, and still juicy as if it just came out of a long-braise or pressure cooker. If I'm remembering it correctly, they also sprinkled some coarse sea salt on the top of it as well which really made the flavor of the meat come alive.  The problem unfortunately was on the bottom AND the top of the taco.  For some reason completely unknown to me, they put thinly-cut soggy fries on top of the meat, and then below, they layered it with TWO not-at-all-toasted corn tortillas.  Now two corn tortillas is not totally uncommon based on a few encounters I've had here and there, but for me it almost completely ruined the dining experience.  There's nothing worse than biting into far too much bread when trying to enjoy a protein.  Whether you're having a burger, a lobster roll, or even a taco, too many carbs surrounding the goodness within will downpour rain all over your day anyday.  As much as I was trying to enjoy the lime, salsa, and salted tongue, all of the flavors kept on being torn away by this awful chewy double-tortilla with soggy potatoes on top.  I eventually just removed the awful breadiness myself to try and enjoy the meat more, but at that point it was already too late.  If they just served the meat on a crisp tortilla with your standard taco accompaniments, I feel like they would be far more successful.  Unfortunately as it stands today, the entire dining experience is weighed down by an egregious amount of dough.  If you do happen to stop by, please keep this in mind and maybe ask them to add more \"customization\" to your order to get a really fine product, because at the very minimum, the meat they cook is very good."}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit! On aime tout d'abord le décor et l'ambiance et quand on goute notre taco, on aime encore plus. 6$ pour un taco bien rempli avec de la coriandre et quelques frites sur le dessus. Trois choix de sauce (aussi bonnes une que l'autre). Comptoir pour commander, quelques places à l'intérieur et 2 petites tables à l'extérieur. Choix de tacos: bavette, chorizo, crevettes, végé, langue, contre-filet. Rien de plus, des tacos et rien d'autre. Rien de négatif! Et ils prennent débit et crédit."}
{"text":"Very delicious tacos! As a resident of Chicago where we are blessed with an abundance of taquerias and surrounded by Mexican natives, I was worried that Mr. Victor's tacos wouldn't compare but they were satisfying. Adding the special Quebecois food favorite of fries is a great touch."}
{"text":"Bien content de ma première visite chez Tacos Victor! Ça faisait longtemps que je voulais l'essayer, mais avec l'explosition de restaurants style mexican dans le sud-ouest de Montreal.....on dirait que j'étais un peu  sceptique.  Le menu est fort simple (j'adore)! 6-7 variétés de tacos à coquille molle avec aux choix: crevettes, bavettes, chorizos, végé, contre-filet..... tous accompagnés de patate frite et sauces piquantes (légère, moyenne, forte) et C'EST TOUT!!!! Pas de guacamole, de burritos ou autres!  Il faut dire que le resto est vraiment de type casse-croûte/take-out. On va pas là bas pour y passer une heure ou deux mais vraiment pour manger un snack!!!  J'ai essayé le taco mélangé au contre-filet/chorizo/bavette et c'était goûteux et bien assaisonné! Beaucoup de saveur en bouche sans oublier un Jarritos à l'ananas pour rincer le tout! Combo parfait !!!!  Vous avez une fringale et vous êtes dans le coin......je vous le recommande!!!"}
{"text":"Good price. Great vegetarian options.  Welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Given that it was packed and that there was a huge line-up for the outdoor takeaway service, it seems pretty clear that others agree. Ex ante, I was a bit skeptical about putting fries in the tacos - but it works well! The people running the resto are super nice and the price is very reasonable as well. I had the bavette and chorizo taco and the shrimp taco. Both were excellent but, at the margin, I preferred the shrimp one. I will definitely come again - probably with some regularity even."}
{"text":"A super fresh, tasty, filling and cheap taco for lunch time!! I love this place. 6$ for a beef bavette taco (one is enough for lunch time) that is filled with cheese and topped with some delicious fries! All the meat choices on the menu (short menu) are marinated there.  The salsas are homemade as well. I will go back, soon and often!"}
{"text":"Delicieux !! Menu simple mais efficace, rapide,  savoureux mmmm . Petite place donc pensez à apporter ... sauces picantes self service dans un grand boll au comptoir."}
