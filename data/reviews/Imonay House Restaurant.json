{"text":"Do you want Korean food? Do you like nice service? Do you appreciate side dishes?  Recently renovated and very welcoming with all the English on their menu.  I wouldn't necessarily go for pork bone soup (Why not go to Owl where it's their specialty? ).  Try something else!  I had their kalbi and it was sooo good.  The marinade is something else.  The cold soybean noodle thing was yummy too.  I think their kalgooksoo is what they're known for, but it's just not my thing.  I would try being adventurous here though, they make tasty food.  Look in at lunchtime and you'll see mostly Korean workers in the area stopping in and c'mon you know that's a good sign.  Oh, and when I asked for a refill of all the side dishes, I was given a limit of 4.  Which was totally fine, but just ask for the ones you really like and don't be a greedy cow like me-- we didn't even end up finishing the second round, hence the limit I guess.  My bad."}
{"text":"It used to be very homey Korean food with kalguksu (knife cut noodles) and chungukjang (smelly soy bean stew).  It had gone thru few changes in owner and the taste isn't the same as before  and price has gone up over the years..."}
{"text":"We came here based on the Yelp rating only to be utterly disappointed with the prices and quality. The prices were outrageous compared to nearby restaurants and for the quantity of food. I ordered a \"large\" pork bone soup which was the same size as small in other places but more expensive. Their signature noodles were mostly just broth and noodles, no meat. My friends ordered Bibimbap which did not come with meat! We realized after that you had to order meat for $3 extra. The side dishes were not very good and when our group of four wanted refills, they never came back even after we asked twice. Tea was also never refilled. Overall service was bad and the food was worse."}
{"text":"Edit: changed it to a two star because the last time I went the restaurant, it smelt really bad, I should have gotten up and left but the waitress already served me tea.  Flies in the summer and smelling bad in the winter; i'm not going back again. Check the discrepancy in their recent reviews vs their old reviews.  I really wanted to give this restaurant a 4-star, but I was just so repulsed by the flies flying around me during dinner yesterday!  It really ruins the ambience when you have 4 flies (yes, I counted) flying over your food and you have to keep fending them off. The possible cause of this could be the warm temperature of summer; the owners did not turn on the A/C and have the fan on instead.  The amount of flies made me question the sanitary conditions in the kitchen...   I ordered a small pork bone soup (they have two sizes - small/regular), and the soup and the meat were tasty. Even though it came in a smaller bowl (because it was a small), the amount of meat was decent (I was still stuffed after the meal).  Instead of plain white rice that a lot of other places give you, I was impressed that they serve black rice (the kind that looks purple).   Do you like side dishes?  If so, they give you 8 different kinds!  And like many places, you can ask for refills if you want.   Final verdict:  I would go back, I really want to try their other dishes (such as the knife noodles mentioned here), BUT only when the temperatures have dropped and there won't be flies flying around the table! :)"}
{"text":"This was our FAVOURITE place, until recently. Apparently the place has new management since last week. We used to go here at least once a month, but do not plan to go back. They've jacked up the prices, aren't offering half of the things (that are still listed on the menu), and the quality is awful. The side dishes used to be homemade and made with care, and now you can tell they are store-bought. They aren't nearly as friendly as Imo was. It's really sad! This used to be the best place, but now, the overpriced, low-quality food is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Incredible bimbimbap, and my vegetarian husband was very happy with his noodles with perilla leaves....very good service, definitely loved the banchan.  Will definitely go back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Imonay today and it was so delicious! It's recently gone through new ownership and with some renovations, the place is clean and bright. The owners are so cheerful and helpful with the menu. I've been to many Korean restaurants on Bloor and not only do they have your favorites (pork bone soup and hot stone rice), they have some authentic local Korean foods I've never had.  We had thie chicken soup noodle and the broth was so rich but not salty. We also ordered the pork bone soup and if you order the larger size where you can share a big pot over a butane gas stove, they help you cook rice in the the remaining soup, it's sooo good! Reasonable prices and big portions!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh and great quality. They are known for their handmade noodles in soup (kal guk soo, kong guk soo). The kimchi is consistently perfect. Great little spot with only about 9 tables."}
{"text":"Imonay has become my favourite Korean restaurant downtown. The side dishes are always changing and excellent (garlic marinated eggplant and garlic scapes were two of the best I've had). They use only black/purple rice, which is great, and their bibimbap gets nicely crisp and has a good balance of veggies with the meat. I've also had their bulgogi, which is really nice if you're looking for a meat-centered meal. Recently I had the kal guk soo (knife noodles) in chicken broth which was flavourful and not too salty.  Overall Imonay is one of the most consistent and delicious places I've been to!"}
{"text":"Found this place by just wandering in. Ordered the kimchi stew.  The service was very friendly, and the restaurant had a warm, familial atmosphere. Definitely liked that a lot.  The food was very good. Generous selection of sides. Kimchi was well-made. You get a lot of food for what you pay for! Using purple rice instead of white was a nice touch.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Korean I've eaten, excellent service at an extremely affordable price."}
{"text":"Good price, but quality is not comparable to others in the area. $23 for a regular pork bone soup, fried glass noodles and a kimchi pancake.  The pork bone soup was tiny, soup was sweet, not spicy even though I asked for extra spicy. The glass noodles were hard to chew, felt like it was not well cooked. The pancake was blend, flavorless. Also there are 7 side dishes... They were OK, nothing special.  The restaurant is small, not very comfortable seating, even compared to the restaurant next door (sunrise). Still would prefer sunrise over this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my second time trying Korean food. My first wasn't so great, but this redeems korean food for me!   The glass noodles was delicious! The  vegetarian pancake was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The noodle soup was good and steak and mushrooms was yummy!  Overall I think i've found my place for korean when Im craving it."}
{"text":"Uh oh. I have to painfully retract my glowing review of this little place. They appear to have new management as of a year or so ago, and I have to say, I'm no longer a fan. While some of the charm of the restaurant has remained, the atmosphere is pretty different. The service is still very nice, but I would no longer recommend eating here as a vegan or vegetarian as when I requested to only be served vegetarian banchan, the server looked confused, and said \"Ok!\".. only to have eomuk bokkeum banchan (fish cake) appear a few minutes later... Please note that I understand that vegetarian is sometimes a strange concept and I know it's a special accommodation -  It's only disappointing because they were VERY understanding of this in the past and if they are to continue to advertise a \"perfect vegetarian\" menu, they should be able to provide that.   Overall as well, the food is no longer as fresh or as spot on as it was in the past. Bean sprouts did not taste fresh and noodles were sort of watery. I have been disappointed the last few times I've come by the lack of clean tables, strange service and underwhelming food. I kept hoping that it would get better, but it hasn't. It's a shame because they offer some vegetarian dishes here that are among my favourites, but I will no longer be coming here because of the dip in quality. I'm pretty sad about it."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. As a regular there, their side dishes are by far the best in town.   My favourite main dishes include:  -kalbi, meat is marinated to perfection -pork bone soup, slow cooked meat is probably the best I've had -kong bi ji, ground soybean soup is so authentic and hearty  I will keep going back as long as I could. When we miss the way my grandma used to cook growing up, this is the place we go.   It's true that the service can be a bit slow, but the wait reading the old national geographics menu is worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious. This is our go-to in Korea town for a pork bone soup fix. Service is excellent, side dishes are plentiful and yummy."}
{"text":"I am a foodie korean with a korean mother who was a chef in Korea so I know what real Korean homecooking tastes like. well that was a lot of Korean loving in one sentence, and thats essentially what i feel for for Imonay Restaurant. Their food is simple and authentic, they dont use excessive amount of salt let alone msg. They use fresh local/seasonal ingredients (esp for their sidedishes) to create their staple dishes. I highly recommend the Kalguksu aka knife noodle soup. Both the broth and noodles are divine. Another fav on menu is 'Cheonggukjang' which is fermented soy bean soup. There are not too many restaurants that do this right but Imo (translation 'aunty'-which is what i refer to the restaurnt owner lady) has the right recipe for this soup. Overall, youre going to get the best korean meal at the best price at Imonay. No1 resto in Koreatown handsdown!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in Korea Town, good place to taste traditional Korean food. Recommend to try the kalbi and the potato soup. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Great value for money & delicious side dishes! Vegetarian and vegan friendly dishes, they even gave me vegetarian kimchi! Loved the food (I tried the jol myun) and had great service. Small, quiet, clean establishment. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the bibimbap and it was okay, I found the rice was a little too watery for me however the side dishes were absolutely delicious. I was served a pickled zucchini of salad (I think), which I haven't gotten at any other Korean restaurants but I became ADDICTED. Favourite side dish for sure!  I'll definitely go back and hopefully enjoy it a little more. I found the staff really pleasant and sweet. It's a bit small so I wouldn't recommend it for large groups.   Will return!"}
{"text":"Small family restaurant so nice homey feel. The rice cakes in fish sauce was not that special. But, their apps and pork bone soup were all excellent and quite unique. Would love to swing by again."}
{"text":"This is my go to Korean food place. The quality and amount is extremely good. In the last couple months, I saw three servers, but they were all nice. Highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"This is hidden gem!!  Good place to experience traditional Korean food.  This will be my new go to place for my Korean kick.   Can't go wrong with the kalbi and the spicy squid.  Service was good!"}
{"text":"We got:  Potato soup- (gamja tang) and knife cut noodles (kalgooksu)  This place is getting 3 stars and not 2 because  their potato soup was pretty decent.   The knife cut noodles was really bad. The soup was glossy (in a bad way) because of the preservatives in the noodles.   Banchan was mediocre.   The restaurant is very clean and the server was very nice."}
{"text":"I always go here to get my bulgogi fix. Theirs is the best i have had in koreatown. Affordable pricing and lots of side dishes too. Staff is very friendly and service is quick."}
{"text":"Reasonable, tasty and friendly. Made my winter stay in Toronto so much better. And they give you a lot of appetizers :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  favourite bibimbap in the city, come here all the time!  great prices, great service, I'm never disappointed when I leave.  I'm not a fan of the fishcake so I always ask for another side dish and they totally are cool with bringing me something else in lieu of my dislike.    Delicious every time.  I never leave here disappointed."}
{"text":"I am thoroughly confused by the majority of the positive reviews regarding Imonay. First off, to establish some street cred, I have lived in Korea and eat Korean food 1-2 times a week here in Toronto. I consider myself to be a connoisseur of kimchi and have a good understanding of what Korean food is supposed to taste like.  I came here with my group of friends after our two usual Koreatown haunts were packed to the brim and with lineups out the door. A quick search online showed that Imonay had good reviews and so we settled on it.  I had a kimchi jiggae (kimchi stew) and kimchi pajeon (kimchi pancake), as well as had my fair share of the standard banchan (side dishes) that accompany Korean meals. I had made a remark to my friends earlier in the meal regarding how I can usually tell how good the food is going to be based on the quality of their kimchi.  The kimchi was the least flavourful kimchi I have ever ever had in my life, full stop. I have encountered some places in Toronto with bad kimchi, but this place takes the cake. The kimchi did not taste properly fermented and was obviously very new kimchi that had not yet developed its flavour, which takes time. Even mediocre kimchi can be bought at local Korean grocery stores for dirt cheap, so I don't understand why we'd be served such terrible kimchi.  As such, the kimchi stew, which was made with similarly tasteless kimchi, had zero flavour. It appears that no salt was used in the stew, nor was their hot sauce very tasty either. The kimchi pancakes were only a tad better than the rest of the meal because of the small plate of salty soya sauce to dip it in.  By the end of the meal I was unsatisfied and asked for a refill of the side dishes, which is customary in Korean restaurants. Side dishes are bottomless and you never have to pay for refills. When I had requested more side dishes the server smiled in acknowledgement but did not bring them. When I asked a second time a few minutes later, she said okay and left. Upon returning a third time, she asked which side dishes I wanted refilled. When I said all of them, she said she could only do one.  Now I do not blame the waitress for this because it is obvious that she is only following the protocol set by the owners. A long time ago I went to Seoul House on Dufferin and Orfus and they too said that side dish refills weren't free and that we would have to pay for more. This is UNHEARD of in Korea and in 99% of Korean restaurants in Toronto. Only Seoul House and Imonay have done this, and I shame them for not being truly authentic Korean experiences in this sense. In Korea they would have been laughed at by their communities and be forced to shut due to such ridicule.  So in other words, the food was not good, the experience was not good and I will not be returning here. There are plenty of great restaurants in Koreatown and hopefully this place will one day be shut down to make room for better food and nicer experiences."}
{"text":"I had the joy of dining here today and ordered the Gamjatang (pork bone soup),  the meal came with  8 side dishes (fish cakes,  kelp,  radish,  leafy greens, zucchini,  cucumbers,  bean sprouts and nappa cabbage kimchi) and a bowl of rice. I particularly enjoyed the kelp sidedish,  but all were wonderful. The pork bone was tender and meaty,  and the broth was well seasoned. Staff were very friendly as well.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Crisis! My partner and I have been going here every two weeks, sometimes more for years. They are now under new management, and the quality has taken a dive. The chef and the menu are different and most importantly our dear Imo isn't there anymore.  The side dishes aren't as good and less plentiful, the dishes didn't have that home cooked quality, and many of our favorites are missing. Not sure where we will go now but it's time to find a new staple for sure! A sad day folks."}
{"text":"i have been there a few times and they were quite decent. if you want something authentic, this place will do nicely."}
{"text":"Great food, cozy atmosphere, and generous staff. Everything looked good and would definitely come back to try more things. Portions are huge and fairly cheap too."}
{"text":"Pre exam jitters call for... kimchi fried rice! I got this delicious meal to go and it came with the four side dishes: fish cake, some fermented leafy greens, bean sprouts, and kimchi with radish. These four side dishes are equivalent to the four leaf clover! Nonsense aside, I called ~20 minutes ahead, picked it up, and now I'm feasting. You should definitely try this affordable and yummy Korean restaurant when down in koreatown!"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian bibimbap I've tried in Koreatown. Serving is bigger compared to other restaurants and comes with way more vegetables! The servers and the owner are incredibly sweet. The place is clean, but doesn't have as much seating as other restaurants. It looks cute though, and it's cozy. The decor isn't so harsh, I find that other restaurants paint their walls a really striking colour and have intense bright lights. This restaurant is comfortable. Suitable fore dates, going out with friends or family. I will be back."}
{"text":"Must have Korean ... Tried seafood pancake, kal guk soo seafood, fermented soybean soup.    The menu was misleading as it noted hand torn noodles but what I got was the regular noodles which were still tasty.  I've had better Seafood pancakes.  You do get a nice selection of banchan though.  Overall okay.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Had the kimchi stew here and it was quite good. Got it spicy and the spice level was manageable (although I could probably go a notch lower next time). I like that it comed with mixed purple/white rice.  8 side dishes! My fave is the seaweed followed by the cucumber dishes."}
{"text":"By far the best bibimbap I've had and keep coming back for. Huge plus for using colored rice but there's also something else that's just special about it.  All the ingredients in whatever you order as well as the side dishes are always very fresh.  The gamja tang and bulgogi are also very good."}
{"text":"We had kong biji and gamja tang, both delicious and warming in this awful weather. And they're generous with the banchan :)"}
{"text":"So disappointed, this used to be my favourite Korean place. When we arrived, we heard the waiters say there was new management/owners. That's not always a bad thing, but it is in this case. There were half the usual side dishes (which were okay but not as diverse as normal), and my favourite seafood pancake was soggy and the ingredients weren't evenly distributed. My army stew didn't have the right noodles, either. The usually helpful staff I was used to seeing were replaced by so-so people who didn't fill our water. To top it all off, their card machine was broken when we went up to pay."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is always friendly and they make very wholesome Korean dishes. Very cosy and everything I've had here has been delicious. I love a good bibimbop and their version of the dolsot (hot stone bowl) is a winner for me. I'm very picky with Korean food because a lot of places use MSG which makes me feel really ill but I never feel bad after eating here so I know it's all natural. I'm so happy this is only a few blocks away from where I live!!"}
{"text":"Best Korean food in town! This is coming from a Korean dude.  Small and cozy restaurant.  Very affordable prices.  Feels like home made food and it tastes good!  They have a nice selection of food and the owners are really nice.   I go there whenever I need my fix of Korean food!"}
{"text":"Loved this Korean spot. As a couple other reviews mentioned, it gets hidden amongst the other restaurants in Koreatown. However, we had no trouble getting in with a group of six people with no reservations whereas other restaurants had a fair bit of wait time on a Saturday evening. The food was delicious and huge portions. The waitress was fantastic, always smiling and very attentive. I would certainly go again. Get the kimchi pancake as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and the food tastes amazing. It was my first time coming to this restaurant and will definitely not be my last time visiting. I ordered the beef sizzling plate that came with rice and miso soup. Also came a variety of side dishes that were absolutely delicious. I enjoyed the home-like atmosphere and the overall experience was great."}
{"text":"Will start this review to say my best friend really loves their pork bone soup. As in she will basically force us all to come here. This small little eatery with seating for 20 is located next to the convenience store and across from the fruit market at Bloor St W and Manning Avenue, on the southwest side.   We were given menus upon our arrival and two cups of water. The restaurant has ample seating and can accompany a large party. They've got a fridge in the front for cold drinks. The menu has your standard fare Korean foods and the servers are friendly.   Their pork bone soup is a large portioned, tasty and homey bowl of wonderful goodness. I didn't personally taste too much MSG and rice is included in the cost.   Love coming here for an affordable meal that leaves me stuffed to the brim. My tummy and wallet are both happy"}
{"text":"Somebody took me here after researching korean restaurants that a vegan can eat at (so sweet, right?!). They even have a vegetarian menu at the front with all the meatless options (some are not vegan, so just be careful what you choose)   The banchan were all standard, and the girl working was extremely sweet and caring. She told me specifically which ones were vegan friendly and which ones weren't, because if you didn't know, kimchi is NOT. She made sure to check on me several times throughout the meal, which was unnecessary but definitely a nice gesture nonetheless.   The veggie dumpling soup I had was warm, filling and hearty. I loved it and was so happy to find a place that served vegetable dumplings!! That is seriously something I rarely find outside when eating. My dining companion ordered the gamjatang and said it was just 'okay, nothing special'   Generally, I'm super impressed about all the options for vegetarians at this restaurant. It's kind of a small place and I can definitely see it being filled up quickly during the rush."}
{"text":"Hands down the friendliest restaurant I have ever been in, like walking into a Koreans mom's kitchen.  Authentic food and side dishes. Enjoyed pickled cucumber with the right amount of spice, all dishes we enjoyed were seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"I love the food here, especially bibimbop and pork bone soup. There aren't enough seats if you go in group. The utensils are bit hard to harness because of its flat shape but you will get a hang of it."}
{"text":"Came here for the  (Cold Soybean Soup) a hard to find summer speciality. Absolutely delicious! Also tried the  (Spicy Cold Chewy Noodles) which were also fantastic! The place is small but on the plus side we were served quickly and the sides were good as well."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times, it's still my favourite to have Korean food. This time we ordered pan fried udon  with teriyaki sauce. I like it but my mom said it was too sweet (she has diabetes). We also ordered sizzling beef,pork bone soup and bibimbap.. the food is so good as usual. Service is always good. It may be a little pricy but the food taste worths it. Love this place."}
{"text":"This place provided authentic Korean cuisine and relaxed atmosphere for costumers. It seems to be a family-owned restaurant and all the staffs worked with each other nicely. But the menu was not as various as many other Korean restaurants in Korean town and the price was not competitive enough.  My friend and I came there at Friday lunchtime. It was not busy but full. We ordered one pork bone soup and one kimchi stew. Both served quickly and had 8 side dishes for each table. We all love the side dish - fish cakes, but other dishes were just so-so. Pork bone soup was not very delicious and my friend thought some other places do better. My kimchi stew was not bad. I love the sour flavour of the soup but it was a little expensive than other places.  Overall, it was a good place to go but not worth coming back."}
{"text":"My friend suggested coming to this Mom and Pop style place to fill up before checking out exhibits on Nuit Blanche.  Good thing for us that around 6pm the place was not busy and packed so it was easy to get a good table and we were promptly given our  menus and a cup of tea each.  I wanted to try something different this time and took awhile for me to decide between the Spicy Beef Stew and the Rice Cake and Dumpling Soup. Finally I decided to go with the Spicy Beef Stew which I was happy that I did :-) My friend chose the Stirred-fried Spicy Chicken.  When our meals were brought out I was impressed with how the beef stew looked. Ok, first of all, the way I pictured the beef stew was that it would be as thick in consistency as the Sundubu Tobu stew with slices of beef visible in the broth. Instead it was this mingled mass of stringy looking vegetables in a steaming red broth with a partly-cooked egg detectable among the reed-like mass. Now, the surprising part of this mass of vegetation was beef. It was shredded so well and mixed in with the vegetables that I couldn't differentiate from the \"gosari\" which also was a similar color. This was good because it made the beef easier to chew. Other vegetables in the soup were green onions, and bean sprouts and it made the stew look hearty and nutritious, especially when eating it with the rice and banchan. It was would have been so comforting if the temperature for that evening had been colder. The flavor of stew just like most Korean stews was spicy enough and had to be toned down by eating it with the rice and a few of the banchan.  My friend also liked his stir-fried chicken and even though I tasted some it, I had to gear my mind and tongue to accept the flavorful taste of it because my tongue was still transfixed on the flavor of my stew :-)  I think for a non-Korean like me I have given all the Korean eateries that I've been too a thumbs-up because they each present their own-take on what they serve and the food that I tried at Imonay also made my mouth and stomach happy."}
{"text":"According to their signage in Korean - which translates to \"Auntie's Kal Guk Soo (which is like pasta made from rice flour, flattened & cut by hand - similar to fettuccine noodles)\" which implies that their Kal Guk Soo is very good. So I went in. I believe this to be a sign that it will be good - it's not GREAT but it's definitely good - I have tried a few different dishes there and they have been delicious. The service was a bit on the slow side but, no complaints.  it's nice and tidy inside, and I love the hand written chalkboard menu. What I thought was kinda funny was their menu is glued to National Geographic Magazine!!!   I have to note that, they are also the only restaurant that brings out white Kimchi - which I thought was interesting.   Overall, good experience - I'd do it again!"}
{"text":"Reminiscent of the low level style buildings in off the beaten path food districts in Seoul, Imonay restaurant is also in a similarly designed building on Bloor St in Toronto. The unassumingly simple architecture almost looks like a pop-up style restaurant that you might see in California or along a beach front, and that's part of the charm of it: simplicity in its design.   I was introduced to this place by a friend who told me of the meaning behind the restaurants name. It means \"Like your aunt makes it\". Sounds like Korean home cooking!  The menu is pretty simple and straightforward, it's no frills. It's separated into apps, sizzlers, hot pot and soups and stews. I've typically ordered the Bulgogi, Kalbi (beef ribs), and Japchae noodles. The food is great. It is more expensive than the average Korean restaurant but the quality of food is amazing. Presentation also gets top marks, as does the service. Friendly and hospitable, there does not seem to be a weak point in their offerings. The fact that the restaurant is small only makes it a cozier experience.  This is the real deal. Go!"}
{"text":"Korea Town.  You don't know what good Korean food is if you eat outside of Korea Town :) And this place is one of the Top 3 in K-Town.  Small, but clean.  Usually crowded, but the lady will do her best to sit you and make you feel comfortable.  You can smell the amazing food inside.  The pork bone soup is out of this earth.  If you don't eat pork - your (great) loss :) The chunk of meat on the pork bone is enough to fill you up by itself. The Kalbi ribs are so good you keep gnawing on the bones after you're done :D An entire spread of side dishes, and they all taste amazing and fresh, unlike some other places.  The Kimchi Soup is probably one of the best you will ever taste outside of Korea! And they hand-make all their noodles!!  Amazing place! If you don't like it - it is on you for having skewed expectations :)"}
{"text":"Unless you have an awesome Korean Mother-in-law who knows how to make authentic Korean Dishes this is the BEST place ever. For the price, quality of food and service you may never anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, which was good enough to warrant another visit. They are usually quite hospitable and friendly, which is why I go back. However I'm not so sure if I'd be back again anytime soon after tonight.  There was sometimes an odd smell or two coming from their kitchen. My friend remarked that it smelled like smelly shoes or BO, which would make me (or anyone else, really) lose my appetite quickly. This place needs better air circulation.  I ordered dumpling and rice cake soup and couldn't finish it all, so wanted to box it for leftovers when I regained my appetite. I was told by the waitress that I shouldn't box it up for leftovers because of the rice cakes would expand and it wouldn't taste as good. Um, okay? I will decide that for myself, thanks.   I suppose I was a bit greedy by wanting to take some of the kimchi daikon and lettuce home. It was that good. However when I asked the waitress if I could box up the kimchi, I was told by the manager that I could this time, but I cannot box up the side dishes next time. I admit that I was confused, mainly due to the language barrier. At first I thought the manager said I should bring my own tupperware to box it up, but then she continued talking and clarified that I should not be asking to take the side dishes to box it up, because.... it's not allowed. While she did say it was 'her fault' (for the misunderstanding), I was still miffed about the reluctance to allow me to box up my soup earlier. I just really don't like to waste food, sorry.  The thing that really got me was that as I was paying for my bill, the manager asked me to 'help her'. I.. don't know how to interpret that. Help her by tipping her more because she told me that I shouldn't ask to box my food up? Help her by tipping her? Isn't that like asking for a tip just ...because? Ugh...."}
{"text":"I had a great time at this place. First of all, the staff are so so so friendly. They were smiling and in a good mood. The food was also very good. At the table we had the pork bone soup and the Korean army stew (first time). Both were delicious and whole place had the feeling of a home cooked meal. The eight side dishes were good too - so much to eat. I will definitely be back to this place for my next craving!"}
{"text":"okie, it wasn't awful, but for me, it did not meet the standards of other restaurants in the area.  I ordered the gam ja tang (pork bone soup), in regular (vs. large).  by all means, not spicy at all! more like the bulgogi flavour (a little sweet, absolutely NO spice). it came with only TWO bones. not massive ones either.  was really disappointed!!!   usually I would think minimum four.    and as standard with any korean meal, we got the banchan appetizers.  a gd amount I would say, about 9 different ones. amazing! quality i thought was very.... not impressive, but not bad.  all in all, would not return.  though the price was only 8 dollars after tax.  though i do love how this is a mom and pop shop.  they are very sweet and provide excellent service."}
{"text":"Definitely a great restaurant and I don't even know where to begin. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted politely and shown to the table. Tea and water was offered immediately from being seated. Decided to go with the hot pot pork bone soup with the Korean noodles.   Side dishes arrived quickly with the gas grill set up. The grill pan filled with the pork bone soup arrived quickly after filled with pork ribs, noodles, potatoes. Most Korean restaurants that I have ordered the pork bone soup usually came with very little meat, but was I pleased with the amount of meat in this dish. The noodles were unique as I've never had this type of noodle before. The noodles help the soup flavor well and gave of a bit of a chew which was nice. Side dishes was standard, but the only draw back was that it was not an all you can eat side dish (not unlimited refills). Service was extremely attentive as a server came to watch the gas stove constantly to make sure the soup didn't dry out or boil out of control.  Will definitely be coming back to order the same dish."}
{"text":"Had some appointments downtown, went to one of my all-time favourite Korean restaurants. This is a small place, with a loyal Korean clientele who have been going there for decades.  Coincidentally, this place is under new ownership.  They have been there for 2 weeks.  The standards are the same.  Stellar, attentive, polite and courteous service.  The mul-nyengmyeon was absolutely gorgeous, strands of cold silk-like nyengmyeon going down my throat with a perfectly acidic/slightly tangy \"broth\".  Fresh cucumbers and lean beef.  I always ask for mine without the egg - only because I am not an egg person.  Panchan was good - kimchi solid - greens delicate and fresh odeng.  HIGHLY recommend this place.  Quiet ambience.  My kind of place."}
{"text":"In my experience this is the best Korean food in Toronto... according to my tastes. I've lived my whole life in small town New Brunswick and rural British Columbia, so keep that in mind... But, As good as it gets for Korean in Toronto in my eyes.  I love that I feel like I'm visiting family when I visit: the atmosphere, the kindness and care of service, and the quality of food all come across as from a place of authentic respect for customers.  I eat a lot of whatever they'll make vegan for me, so read the other reviews to find out if the pork bone soup or animal parts are good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful place for lunch.   Wasn't expecting my bimbap bowl with bulgogi to be cold but it was still very tasty."}
{"text":"With so many restaurants to choose from in Koreatown, Imonay stands out to me for their incredible service. The servers are very friendly and check up on you during your meal, something I find rare in Asian establishments. They also refill the side dishes without me having to wave them down. It's a small family owned restaurant but the food is amazing and made fresh to order. We always get the kalbi combo for $8 more and the meat is always tender and well seasoned. I like that they make an effort to add vegetables to the meat dishes, so you'll see mushrooms with the kalbi. The squid is a favourite of mine. It's slightly spicy but I like the way they cook it. It's become another great go-to spot for lunch."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was not satisfied but then I decided to come back a second and had a better experience. Initially, I ordered the yakisoba and it did not taste like the traditional japanese yakisoba. It was really sweet and salty and there was too much sauce when it should be a stir-fry dish. Second time I came, I got their kal guk soo and they gave a lot like A LOT of noodles which surprised me. It was just white flour noodles with cucumbers and cabbage, sauce on the side. You will get your money' s worth here for sure. To add, their rice cakes are really good as well, not that spicy."}
{"text":"This review is mainly about one particular dish I've always eaten at Imonay. When I was a kid, I used to go to Imonay for chicken kalguksoo, which is Korean-style wheat flour noodle (kinda like Japanese udon but a thinner cut). They were the best noodles I ever had in my life, \"slurp 'em down\" amazing. Thick pieces of chicken, steamy flavorful broth, and noodles that you gulp down they were so good. It was my family's favourite place to eat whenever we were in Koreatown. Since then, ownership has changed a couple of times, and the kalguksoo has never been the same...  Having said that, the current ownership seems to have the dish almost right. They serve it with smaller pieces of chicken, but the broth is still tasty, and the noodles are good (although I don't slurp them down like I did when I was a kid... perhaps for the better). Whenever I miss kalguksoo, I'll go here to get an experience that is almost (but not quite) as good as the one I had as a kid.  The \"Imo\" (aunt) is a kind and friendly woman who serves as front of house."}
{"text":"Came in early for dinner around 4:30 PM since my friend and I got tired from exploring Korea town. A friendly server sat us down and gave us time to look over the menu before coming to take our orders. My friend ordered a sizzle sizzle bulgogi plate while I ordered the pork bone soup after seeing the reviews on Yelp!    They served us six side dishes while we waited. The restaurant was petite but very cute since it was a family  restaurant.  The food arrived fairly quickly and I was surprised at how big the portion of meat was in the soup! The soup and meat was really filling so I ended up not getting dessert as I had planned to.  It was a yummy meal to eat while it began to rain outside.  Definitely enjoyed my experience here and I can't wait to drop by again in the future!"}
{"text":"Imonay is an unpretentious Korean place that gets lost in a busy stretch of Bloor.  This came recommended as a place that has a lot of vegan and vegetarian options. The menu notes what's vegetarian, but they can make most of these vegan for you. The server acted like this request was nbd.   The food was good, the portions were large, and the prices are pretty great."}
{"text":"Great wholesome Korean food made with care. Generous selection of fresh side dishes. Perfect apart from the dive interior, if that bothers you."}
