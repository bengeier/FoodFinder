{"text":"Amazing thin crust pizza! They also offer a great topping selection. Best pizza in montreal !!!"}
{"text":"SLOW A$$ delivery. MORE THAN AN hour. multiple calls

Ordinary food, was definitely not fresh out of the oven when it arrived

I can't imagine ordering from them again when there are so many options and the product is average quality."}
{"text":"This is a good little neighborhood pizza joint. The ingredients are fresh and plentiful, the prices are pretty reasonable and the owner's are down to earth and friendly.
My favourite pizzas are the Mascarpone, the Bruschetta, the Grecque, and the Bagnara. I assume the others are all as quality but I wouldn't know, never having tried them.

My neighbours and I pretty much rely on their take-away option given that we live so nearby that we might as well nosh in the comfort of our own homes. Pizzas are normally ready more quickly than the competition's so it's a good place to call if you're hungry \"Right Now!\""}
{"text":"Pizza incroyablement goûteuse!  J'adore commander là. Cependant je voulais aller manger sur place et le site ne disait pas si c'était possible. En me présentant la j'ai bien vu qu'il y avait seulement 2 petites tables ..."}
{"text":"We ordered a greek pizza with no olives because of allergies. We received the pizza full of olives so then proceeded to contact \"Jack\" the manager on January 20th at 6pm. We then asked to be compensated with a complimentary dessert. \"Jack\" rudely responded with just NO. Needless to say we will never order from this place. Our time was wasted and it took over 2 hours to get the pizza we actually ordered. Very bad customer service."}
{"text":"I was so craving carbs and felt like pizza, so decided to order delivery from this spot as opposed to my regular joint a few streets down which is know for its crazy thick over the top gooey pizzas. They have a variety of interesting combinations with ingredients like goat cheese or mascarpone but I decided to keep it classic with a pepperoni pizza. 

I placed my order and I received it a half hour earlier than expected, yeah! Although not piping hot, my pepperoni pizza was very flavourful, great sauce, not too much cheese but they were generous with the pepperoni. The pepperoni was so a good quality meat as opposed to the cheap small slices you usually see. I really liked the thin wood oven crust too! The size was decent for a large (8 slices) and the price, although maybe higher than the other chains, was well worth it. Delivery was free too! 

I'm definitely keeping this place in my speed dial.."}
{"text":"I recently ordered pizza from here and I really enjoyed it ! A bit pricier than your every day chain like dominoes but worth the extra money. Wood oven pizza with very flavourful cheese and toppings , you can't go wrong ! I did not wait long for my order to arrive and my pizza was hot when I got it which was great . I've tried a few different pizzas of theirs  but my favourite is the four cheese. I've heard the princess pizza is also excellent . I haven't yet been to the location itself so I am not sure if there is any sit down dining but I can say I was very satisfied with my experience ordering in. My only complain was that they don't have much if anything in the way of side dishes but the pizza is so good it makes up for it. I look forward to ordering from here again ."}
