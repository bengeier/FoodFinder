{"text":"Terrible sushi...stale seaweed paper that is chewy when you bite into the rolls, just awful! And service is slooooow...went for takeout, restaurant was half empty and my order took over 20 minutes. When I asked if it was ready the server said I will call you when it is when I clearly saw it sitting on the counter behind her. She went on to serve several other tables and then finally decided to give me my food... I felt like a hostage! Never again!"}
{"text":"This place is really great. It's cheaper than most places, you get your money worth. Service is great. I based this on other Japanese restaurants I have been to, so far this place is on my top list. I have came back from time and time again, where as, other places I would only go once based on presentation, taste and service!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place on a short notice. Today I was very disappointed. The service was minimal and there is a mandatory 10% tip calculated in your bill. For 2 people $39. and that was only lunch!! Will not be recommending this place any longer."}
{"text":"Went to Sail Sushi last night, was not impressed at all!! First of all, the waitress dropped a bowl of hot Miso soup on me, getting all over my top, pants and boots. 
To which, the waitress who was serving me and another waitress laughed, didn't help me. And then proceeded to tell me the waitress who was helping was new. 
I didn't make a big deal at the time, the waitress came over to tell me I would get a discount because of what happened - which may I just say the manager of the restaurant at the end laughed at the fact that they dropped soup on me and then brushed off the fact that I would get a discount. 
At the end of the night, it still cost me 70.00 for 2 people, no alcoholic drinks. Just water and the manager didn't even give me a receipt.

Although the sushi is average, the service is beyond awful and the manager doesn't care about how the customers are treated. In fact, she was extremely rude. 

Do NOT go to this sushi place. Overpriced and shitty service. I mean come on, the waitresses and manager laughed about dropping hot soup on a customer and then didn't even honour the so called discount they said I was getting.

Don't waste your time with this establishment. There are plenty more all you can eat sushi places around with better sushi and MUCH better service."}
{"text":"food was fine for the price. but you actually charged me $5 for a couple pieces of left over food. ive never been charged anywhere else. the charge is really just try not to waste the food. we had 2 pieces left and she wanted me to pay extra. Good luck getting me to come back."}
{"text":"For some reason I just find the sushi and dishes at this place much more superior than any of sushi restaurant. The service here is quick and the place has a relaxing atmosphere that I enjoy but I stopped coming here because I personally think it's overpriced."}
{"text":"Went there with family (4) a couple of days ago as we had a $10 off coupon (did not notice it had expired - bummer).  Most tables were empty but service was still quite slow.  None of the staff seemed to be happy to see us.  The restaurant is clean, though utilitarian. 
We ordered a sushi party tray as none of us was very hungry for the \"all you can eat\" deal.  The sushi was very mediocre and not much better than what you can get from an asian supermarket.  I usually give restaurants at least 2 visits before writing them off, just in case they have a bad first visit.  So I will update this review when I visit the second time but they really need to do better."}
{"text":"Surprised to have such a good quality sushi restaurant in an area that you wouldn't expect to find Ayce sushi. Food was delicious, and price was decent. We'll definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"What a joke.  Yet another of these cookie-cutter AYCE \"Japanese\" places that give you an iPad to place orders, in order to avoid problems of waiters misunderstanding orders, or the kitchen sending out the wrong food.   At this place, the iPad didn't help at all, on a busy night.

This review is based on 2 visits. Our first time, we found service to be maybe a notch slower than Dragon Rolls (similarly designed restaurant in Pickering with almost identical food and iPad software), but for a lower price point, sure, it wasn't horrible and we decided we'd return.  Did get a laugh out of the signage on the front door, and the empty box of frozen spring rolls left there (so now we know where they get their food from...)  See photos....

Second visit 2 weeks later, but this time we went on a Saturday night when the place was a lot busier.  Their staff could not handle an 80% full dining room.  Almost an entire order we placed somehow \"disappeared into the ether\" so the manager lady (after finally noticing we were sitting for more than 15 minutes without any food in front of us) had to come over and MANUALLY write down by hand our order, reading it off our iPad, then carried the handwritten order back to the kitchen!  And even then we were still missing items.  We even re-ordered things and of course only 1 was delivered, so more missing orders.   The \"sushi\" guys seemed to be able to keep up with most of their orders, but whoever works the kitchen at the back (especially whoever handles tempura frying) is slow as molasses.

The table next to us seemed to have similar issues -- after they were served DESSERT a server came by to deliver an order of sushi, to which the frustrated customer answered \"I ordered that two hours ago. Too late now! I don't want it...\"

At Dragon Rolls every visit, we are in and out of there (and full) in an hour. This second visit at Sail took TWO HOURS with a lot of waiting for food delivery.

If you're going to dine here, avoid busy times unless you plan on wasting 2 hours of your evening frustrated and hungry...."}
{"text":"It's good if you're looking for a cheap all you can eat option but service isn't always the best and the food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"The food was good, the atmosphere was nice, the place itself was clean including the washrooms, and the service was pleasant. Much better than the sushi place this restuarant was before. The prices are reasonable and they have an iPad menu - with pictures and dish explanations - which is where you place your order. My only complaints would be the lack of options in the dessert menu and the cardboard tasting japanese tea (I've had better)."}
{"text":"Good menu selection, reasonably priced and decent quality. 

I must start this review by saying I love sushi, but I have only really eaten it at AYCE places. Point being, my palette isn't as refined as say someone who eats a la carte sushi. That being said I really like Sail! Firstly their location is about a 10 minute drive from home so we can decide we want sushi at 1 pm and get the gang together with ample time to eat. The AYCE actually ends at 3:30pm for lunch so that's a plus. Now down to the actual food.

I like the size of their maki rolls. You know sometimes you get these huge monster pieces that you can't fit into your mouth so you sacrilegiously bite into and ruin the whole experience all together? That doesn't happen here. They have regular and speciality rolls. Random ones like teriyaki chicken while is interesting. Standard for the most part. You can also get a very small selection of dim sum (3 options) which isn't a lot but still good. Their appetizer chicken wings, chicken skewers and mango salad are a few of my favourites (random I know). They also have the standard miso soup and a more extensive \"Chinese food\" section if that's your fancy. 

Dessert leaves something to desire, although I haven't gone to an AYCE sushi place where I'm like \"wow that was great dessert\". Students get 10% off with their student card so generally the price is around $18 for a weekday lunch. Also to note they use iPads to order. I personally like the use of iPad ordering because I get to see exactly what I'm ordering and there's a record of what you've ordered in case they miss something or give you the wrong order (which have both happened and they have remedied)."}
{"text":"Ordered from Skip the Dishes. Great portions and tastes good. Well priced. I havent been to the physical location yet, but so far we enhoy their food."}
{"text":"I went here after the renovation from Omi Sushi. So the place did get a bit of an upgrade; that is the iPad menu only. There are new owners and I didn't like them that much. I've eaten at Omi sushi several times before with leftovers and didn't get charged for it. My friend and I had AYCE lunch and we left about 5 sushi and 2 tiny sashimi. The manager came to take it away and said because you're ordering more food, we're going to have to charge you for the leftover. I said sure but how much is it? This woman (the manager) didn't even have a standard pricing for the leftover, she eyeballed everything and said each sushi costs 50 cents while the sashimi costs $1 each. Didn't make sense because duh it didn't add up to to what we had leftover. Truly pissed time off but I just let it go. Staff was hard to get at times. 

Other than that, food was good, variety of menu items to choose from. Great place to stay in and have lunch and dinner with friends or family. Food came out in time. 

Oh the sign at the cash out is hilarious... had to read several times to figure out what they were saying."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The price is not bad and the food is decent. The service is not that great. They always try to rush you and when you ask for help they do not always understand. Do not go at night when it's busy because it will take forever to get your order. If you go at 9 and it's not that busy, they will rush you so they can get out once the restaurant closes at 10:30. Other sushi places do not rush me even if it's close to the closing time. I understand you want to get out on time but do not constantly tell us that you are closed. Good sushi place because of the great food and close by the area, but the service needs more training."}
{"text":"I went with the Groupon on a Tuesday evening. It came out to be around $20 for AYCE dinner after tax and tips, which is pretty cheap! The food was as expected from an AYCE. I have no complaints, especially for the price. The iPad made it faster to order and food came out quickly.

My group went on the day of our friend's birthday, so we went ahead of time to give it to the staff. They were very accommodating and made sure to bring out plates and forks. The staff member who brought out the cake also sang Happy Birthday with us to our friend, which was a nice touch. I didn't expect it from an Asian-run restaurant. Service was quite nice.

I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We came here by accident and was pleasantly surprised by our decent experience. Service was good and food was good. Lots of items to choose from.  Just bare in mind that this is a NO WASTE establishment meaning you may have to pay for what you can't eat so don't order crazy. I really wish they served half portions of the rolls because there was much more that we wanted to try but there is no way two people could eat so much. So come hungry or with a group."}
{"text":"Worst sushi place ever. Ordered a California roll and Avocado roll and got laughed at by the waitress because I \"wasn't eating enough\". In an empty restaurant I had to wait over 20 minutes for my food, watching the cooks walk away for 10 minutes after being told my order before they came back to make it. When I finally got my rolls, half of the avocado was brown and rotten. I had to pick half of it out of the rolls. No tip, and definitely never going back again."}
{"text":"My go to all you can eat sushi restaurant in Scarborough. A little expensive but I always enjoy the food ."}
