{"text":"I would like to preface this review by saying that my most recent visit to Brownstone was by far my best. I left a negative review previously, and everything was true - but this time around it was FANTASTIC.

Julian was a very nice waiter and was fairly quick in accommodating us. I started with the house Malbec. It was a great glass & I recommend it. Our appetizer was the braschetta. It was very fresh and the bread was nice and crunchy.

My girlfriend ordered the chicken special that was stuffed with berries, (I believe blackberries,) and goat cheese. It was topped off with a very nice mushroom and chicken gravy. It was served on a bed of mashed potatoes with fresh veggies. This was a truly savory dish & I made sure to tell them how much we liked it.

I ordered the ravioli of the day - a lobster ravioli. When the dish came out it was actually a mushroom ravioli. I told Julian about the mistake, and he apologized about the error & quickly brought out a fresh plate for me. Because of the mistake - he comped our appetizer & boxed the first dish for me too. The funny part was that I actually  like the mushroom ravioli better.

The food was awesome. There was a slight communication error somewhere between the front & back of the house - but Julian made up for it with excellent customer service. I would recommend this place & TRY THE GOAT CHEESE CHICKEN!

{"text":"Came here for a dinner with friends 2 weeks ago and everything was great! I'd never expected this from the outside, but the dishes all came in looking pretty and they taste even better. I tried their cod and we also ordered the smoked Simon flat bread for appetizer, both were delicious. Their bar area looks great for an after-work drink! Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"My wife and I attended on a Friday evening. She ordered the tenderloin sliders and I ordered the meatball linguine. This was after ignoring the \"clean\" fork that had old food caked on. 

The food came very fast, but this turned out to be the downfall. My wife's first bite into the slider exposed a bright pink, raw burger. We aren't talking a bit pink, we are talking bright red like a blue rare steak. And it tasted COLD, which is just nasty. 

We had a side of sweet potato fries as well. I dipped one in the aioli sauce. It was a bit chewy. There was a piece of PLASTIC in the aioli! At this point, we couldn't believe it and thought we were part of some bad joke. 

It is UNSAFE to eat here, so don't do it. 

We didn't make a huge fuss, but we did tell the server that we had enough and were leaving. They removed the dishes and some awkward man came over and said \"sorry, how about a free appetizer next time?\"  What a complete joke and insult. I'm not sure what they could have said at that point, but they definitely didn't offer and explanation or apology. Now date night has turned to puke in the washroom night, literally. 

We will never be back here, despite living in the area. The health inspector should visit here and have a field day. It's unsafe to eat here. If you want COLD, RAW processed meet and plastic in your food, this place is for you. 

Just disgusting and an obvious lack of care from management. I normally am laid back but this is just unacceptable."}
{"text":"I've visited Brownstone three times in the past year and I have yet to be disappointed.  If you want to impress your date then you're at the right place.  The ambience is very cozy even on the patio right by Yonge St.  My girlfriend and I had the lamb skewers and chicken tenders (comes with pickles and chips).  We're both big fans, however, we thought the skewer portions were a bit small ($12 for 5).  The bar has an interesting selection of microbrewed beers.  I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very decent food

I've passed this place hundreds of times, and have noticed it busy at brunch time, but for whatever reason never considered it until recently. We went on a Thursday - their Martini night. I opted for the Raspberry Cosmo, hubby the Chocolate Martini and they were pretty good. $8 for 3 oz - great deal.

Our waitress was fabulous, she was perfectly balanced in terms of her attention to service and hospitality.

I ordered the Chicken Marsala - not normally a dish I would order out, but the chicken was very tender. Surprisingly good. Hubby ordered the Calabrese pizza, and our two other friends the Lasagna. All of us cleaned up our plates! A good sign. 

Ambiance is OK, we were by the front door; I think I would have preferred to sit on the other half of the restaurant (seemed cozier).

I'll definitely be back, this time for brunch."}
{"text":"TLDR- I would strongly recommend this place - good food, good prices, vegetarian friendly, high quality steaks & grilled perfectly. 

Firstly whoever categorized this as only Italian food is totally out in left field. This is a Bistro serving Italian & american food and is comparable in style to the Keg. They even have a special steak night menu - which is available friday, saturday and  sunday night. After having a terrible time with the food in Mexico on my vacation, I came back home to Canada looking for a good steak. I wanted real food and good food and immediately Brownstones popped up in my mind. I ordered the 16$ \"FILLET MIGNON 4oz Bacon-wrapped beef tenderloin topped with gorgonzola butter demi glaze\" and my dinner partner ordered off the steak night menu which included a AAA steak, garlic shrimp and a side of mixed vegetables and rosemary potatoes for under 30$. I enjoy my meat bloody and rare and  Brownstones delivered a perfectly rare filet minion. My dinner partner ordered his medium rare and again it was grilled to perfection.  The steak night includes an appetizer of soup or salad and then of course the main which is large in portion size. The food was professionally plated and had a very appealing presentation. If you want to impress on date night without breaking the bank, I would highly recommend this place. The steak it self was juicey, wasnt overly chewy, and had overall a good consistency and texture. The price was comparable and if not cheaper than the Keg. I would say the quality of food is better than what is available at the Keg. From a vegetarian perspective you will mostly certainly find foods on the menu suitable for your needs, which includes pasta, pizza, salad, wraps and of course this magic portabello  mushroom. This menu really leaves no one behind. The atmosphere is gothic chic, and the service is professional, timely and the waiter is very attentive. I knocked off 1 star as i felt the food was a bit slow to come out to the table, however, it does take time to make master pieces."}
{"text":"Three of us went there for dinner. All our menus were dirty, and so was everyone's cutlery. I ordered mushroom soup, got tomato soup instead. The beef Wellington special was way over-salted and overpriced; both the meat and the vegetables looked and tasted like something you'd expect from a cheap frozen dinner. Plus, the waiter interrupted conversations at our table several times to babble about nonsense like his fancy bottle opener. The guy who served our food threw my soup spoon (also dirty) on the table. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight for their winterlicious menu after seeing all the positive reviews. Must say the restaurant gives off a wonderful first impression. The decor is lovely, very cozy and inviting. I saw prior to arriving that they took part in restaurant takeover, and since it was my first time visiting I have no idea what it looked like before but it's absolutely beautiful now. We also had a delightful waiter, can't remember his name however he instantly brightened up the table with his quirky jokes and attentiveness.

For the appetizers we had the risotto balls and the miami shortribs. The risotto balls were nice, but a bit bland without any sauce (there was only a small amount on the plate). They did however have a great texture, crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The short ribs were nothing special and a bit bland as well. 

Onto the mains, we had the pepper crusted striploin and the roasted beet ravioli. The striploin was decent, the fries were fresh and the gorgonzola butter was heavenly. However, the home made ravioli stole the show. Hands down some of the best pasta I've ever had. The sauce was so creamy and had a slight sweetness which complimented the earthy beet perfectly. My only complaint is that I wanted more! I could have eaten 20 of them instead of the 4 large ones I received. Hopefully this makes it onto their regular menu as I would return again and again for it. 

Overall our experience was good. Great atmosphere, great service and good food. Took one star off for the meat appetizer and entree being a bit mediocre, but still above average compared to plenty of other restaurants. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and got my favourite table both times!  Right in the corner window to watch Yonge St. pass by!  Only ever ate Chicken Penne (AMAZING), Caesar Salad (big enough for two) and their fish and chips (out of this world!) but I LOVE this spot!  Can get busy in the evenings, so get there early if you don't want to wait for a table.  Only downside is there is only one washroom for men and one for women....(not elaborating on that but I'm sure you catch my drift)."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on jazz night, which was lovely. And had a great time but the food took a very long time (only ordered pastas and calamari app). The waitress also seemed a little bit clueless which made us have to repeat ourselves a few times. The prices are a little up there for the portions but for the atmosphere it was expected."}
{"text":"The food was great! Very tasty! And the price was very responsible! From appetizer to desert were surprise me!"}
{"text":"I've been to Brownstone Bistro many times. Definitely a place to go if you just feel like having a good dinner. I think there is something for everyone. If you feel like having a classic or something a little different. I'm always full and satisfied. It's not overpriced for it's perfect portion sizes. I will especially rave about the BRUNCH here though, I look forward to it the most! So delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here last week for a late dinner with friends. Service was slow because of the crowds but beer was served in branded glasses and drinks were quick to keep us happy.

The food quality is middle of the road, with traditional American choices. I tried the quesadillas this time around was happy with the meal. They were served with some sweet potato fries which I enjoyed. My friends ordered different dishes and seemed pleased. However, there is nothing distinguishing the menu from similar spots around town.

What makes this place worth visiting is the atmosphere it creates for engaging dialogue with friends. We sat there for hours ordering pitchers as our group of 4 (which grew to 6 over time) loquaciously wore the night away."}
{"text":"Saw that they had a new menu so thought we would try it out. They have great daily specials and amazing cocktails. 

We came here for brunch one Sunday and it was pretty good actually. Apparently they were voted top ten brunch places in Toronto the waiter said."}
{"text":"On the plus side: decor and ambience are perfect for a bistro, and after a big initial hiccup, the service was excellent. My guest was very pleased with her order, so that was a plus.

The negative: they have to focus on execution. We ordered the seafood special (grilled salmon, shrimp, calamari trio), and it was simply not very good. The portion of salmon was small, and 1 piece was still raw in the middle. The calamari was rubbery and tasted like it was previously frozen. The menu advertised a 'spinach-potato quiche', which was just mashed potatoes. For $24, I expected a lot more.
My pasta order was decent, but definitely nothing to rave about. The fantastic sauce didn't mask very overcooked chicken and sausage, which was a shame.

The other issue was the wait for service. It appeared that our server was doubling as the bartender, which makes no sense for a restaurant of this size. We finally had to go order our food from her at the bar after waiting for 15 minutes after she delivered our drink order. 

I wouldn't rule out another visit, but I would definitely order something else that (hopefully) delivered better value."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 7:30 tonight. When I arrived there on time, there was a long lineup from the front desk to the door. Everyone was waiting for their seat even though they made a reservation just like me. The manager kept saying to people to step back. It was a chaos. I asked the front desk girl about my reservation and mentioned there was an empty table for 2, but she said that was a table for people who made a reservation for 7:00 and who were not there yet. Meanwhile, the restaurant was full of people waiting for a table. My friend and I just decided to go somewhere else. WHAT IS THE POINT OF MAKING A RESERVATION IF YOU CAN'T GET A SEAT WHEN YOU ARRIVE ON TIME?????????????? I will never go there again. Horrible experience although I haven't had a bite of their food."}
{"text":"I was at Brownstone Bistro last night for dinner with a group of 7 ladies. First, how to enter the restaurant is confusing as the door you think you should enter is blocked off. I was greeted immediately but it seemed they didnt have a table for our reservation so we were placed in the awkward booth table in the back corner. This table was awkward to get into your seat as you had to slide across sticky on a hot day leather to sit at a spot with too many pillows and not enough room to cross your legs. Good luck getting to the bathroom if you ended up at the back of the booth. It was also a huge table, making it very awkward for being served, as even the server pointed out. Which she pointed out on one of the few occasions she remembered to visit our table. We sat for a good 20 minutes before she returned to take our drink order, which was the only time we were offered drinks during our 2 hour meal. The food was good but I would have preferred my steak be served on a cutting board without cracks so our table didn't end up covered in steak juice. Our dishes were cleared promptly, however my steak juice leaking cutting board was left with us for 20 to 30 minutes, with another 15 or so minutes passing before we could ask for our bills. Overall, the service absolutely sucked here, badly enough that I would not return for another meal and have been driven to write my first ever review."}
{"text":"The quality of service stunk, which is why the rating I have given is low. The waitress was not very friendly and snubbed us because me and my friend were using a coupon for lunch.

I got the chicken pot pie, which was quite tasty but very oily. 

Pass!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on December 13th and I'm very much impressed.
 The atmosphere was obviously jolly due to season,  the venue was half full. The hum was constant but not overbearing. The Christmas decorations were very tasteful. The tree was magnificent.
The waiter was nice but not overbearing. He screwed up our order a little bit (I ordered my steak raw and my friend wanted it medium), but we quickly figured it out and just switched the steaks. (the sides for our main courses were right). My friend's steak came with a creamy carrot soup, that was just heavenly!!!
If you are gonna go for dessert, choose the chocolate/caramel cake. It is delish, and the waiter nodded approvingly.
I also, hear that their pastas are to-die-for, so I'm looking forward to going to Brownstone for lunch soon."}
{"text":"The worst winterlicious experience ever!

Service: I had made a reservation. But when we arrived, the waitress said the restaurant is full and we can either choose to leave or wait. In the end, we waited 15 mins to be seated.

Food: Goat cheese appetizer was delicious. But my friend's soup was too spicy and taste watery. Main course was average. They were running out of desserts. End up we were served with a very tiny bite of cake.

Food recommended: Warm goat cheese appetizer
Service: 2/5  Food: 3/5  Value: 3/5
Return: No"}
{"text":"Brownstone needs to lower its prices to get a better rating. I paid 100 dollars(tax plus tip) for dinner service which was only worth 50-60.

The cutlery and silverware were dirty and seats wobbly (outside seating).

Food was reasonable but not worth 30 dollars per entree."}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate st patty's day in style at this venue with 8 of our friends. 

We received an appetizer platter topped with grilled shrimp, chicken skewers, calamari, and a deep fried veggie potato cheese ball. Everything was delicious.

The servers came around to take our drink orders and were very attentive all night.

I ordered the angus burger for $13 which came to $17 with tax and tip. It comes with a choice of sides (soup, salad, fries, and sweet potato fries). I ordered the sweet potato fries. The burger was very good with red onion, lettuce, a pickle. tomatoes and a side of sauces to add to your liking.  They however did not ask how I wanted it cooked and it came well done (I prefer medium rare). 

My friends ordered the risotto, salmon and oven baked chicken penne. None had any complaints. The food looked very good. 

We also sampled their dessert menu. We tried the cheese cake, the chocolate mousse cake, the tiramisu, red velvet cake, and pecan tart. Everything tasted very good. My favorite was the tiramisu.

The venue had high ceilings in the dining area with fancy glass chandeliers. Mirrors and paintings adorned the exposed brick walls. The furniture is modern minimalist. The bar side had a couple of stools and 2 giant screen televisions. 

The owner is a spunky asian gal called Rain who is extremely friendly  and greeted all the guests going from table to table to introduce herself. She was telling us about the new chef they hired for the restaurant.

Since it was st. Patty's day, if you ordered a litre of a specific kind of beer, you got to keep the mug and received a free T-shirt. 

I give this place a 4 start because the food and service weregood. I would definitely go back. Apparently they have steak night on Fridays. I definitely want to try the steak."}
{"text":"Before beginning my review, I want to emphasize that Brownstone Bistro has been a favourite of my boyfriend and I's since we moved to Toronto.  With that said, it has ALWAYS been hit and miss.  The food is great and the prices are even better.  The service on the other hand, is the big miss.  Almost every time we've come the servers have been a little on the unfriendly side, as well as painfully slow.  I'm not going to fully blame the servers because it's obvious that they need to have more people on during peak hours.  

Last night my boyfriend and I decided to go with what we know and head to Brownstone.  We made reservations so our table awaited us.  I love the atmosphere of this place.  Exposed brick, candle lit and funky paintings on the wall.  Good start! From there, disaster.  First, my gin and tonic and his rum and coke served in small martini glasses.  Um, ok? My drink was spilling all over the table when the server brought it over.  That's fine though, I'm really not too picky about those things.  We ordered the crusted goat cheese appetizer which was delicious.  After ordering dinner we had to actually head up to the bar to order or next round.  The waiter was no where to be found.  Finally our meals arrive. The veal parmesan and the chicken scallopini.  To my surprise mine was freezing.  Now, I'm not one to really complain, but when my vegetables and gravy are cold to touch, I'm going to get a little frustrated.  After deciding it was uneatable, we searched for our server who was again, no where to be found.  Once again we went to the bar and sent our food back.  Our server finally came back in after a long smoke break and apologized and told us we could have a free desert.   

Our meals came back out, and the second time around they were delicious, just what I was hoping for! My boyfriend and I decided that we would be too full for desert, so we were planning on asking for an entree or drink to be taken off the bill.  Before we could approach our waiter about this he came out with some sort of coffee cake desert thing to split.  I was really bothered by this.  Brownstone Bistro sends out cold meals and doesn't even give me the option to choose my free desert? At this point the only option was to reflect our disappointment in our tip, which is something I hate doing.  

I really hope the owner of Brownstone Bistro looks at this review.  They have an amazing restaurant with excellent food and obviously dedicated customers.  Why ruin your reputation by trying to save a few bucks on Servers? 

I will not be returning to Brownstone Bistro for a while..."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant because I was given a coupon for a free appetizer while walking by. No where did it say that the coupon was only to be used for spring rolls but apparently it was. We ended up trying 2 appetizers and both had the burger. The food was below average and I probably wouldn't go here again. The space however is really cool. Love the exposed brick interior."}
{"text":"We truly savoured and treasured a wonderful Sunday brunch at The Brownstone Bistro on Sept. 2, 2012. It seemed to be one of those occasions where the stars were perfectly aligned and you think to yourself \"Who could ask for anything more?\" The sun was shining but there was a cooling breeze. The restaurant is on a busy Yonge Street corner with lots of pedestrians so the people-watching is unparalleled. The food was scrumptious (especially the Eggs Spanikota). The service was prompt and attentive; the owner even pitches in and helps his staff when needed. And $5 Caesars ... need I say more? The best brunch that we have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Went for weekend brunch and weeknight dinner. Awesome brunch menu and good dinner menu. Food is reliably good quality service is okay. Will go back at some point"}
{"text":"Visited here last night after a very long time. Very relaxed atmosphere lots of candles and subdued lighting. Food was good and very reasonable, Cheerful server, was not up to par on things but went out of her way to find the answers Prices are very reasonable except the special wine being promoted. Stick to those listed on the wine list.
Will try their Brunch soon and report back....

{"text":"OK spot especially for breakfast or brunch. Good service and quantity of servings for the price is worth it. As a baked been guy, the ones they serve tasted like they came from a Hinze's can."}
{"text":"Came here before our Potted Potter Play, we really enjoyed this place, the food, service and atmosphere was fantastic.

I had the chicken club wrap, very delicious.

Will be returning :)"}
{"text":"Came here a Sunday evening with some friends. In regards to food, it was not bad. Our table had steaks and pasta. It was good but nothing special. Prices were a little high. 
The interior of the restaurant was empty except for us. The patio had a little more tables filled. With this, I thought service would be better but it was a little lacking."}
{"text":"Good service, excellent food selection. Wouldn't recommend the sirloin steak as it was dry.  However, everything else was excellent!  Looking forward to visiting again"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and lasagna, pizza was good lasagna was a bit undercooked. Otherwise the patio and the smokers beside us was a great experience! Overall not bad!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant many times and have always enjoyed an excellent meal.  The service has improved much since last summer and the owner is always friendly and courteous even when my 2yr old is cranky.  It's a great place for brunch or some appetizers with friends or to enjoy a drink on the patio on a nice summer day.  I recommend this restaurant for anyone if you're in the area.

{"text":"Food is great for the price point. Caesars Sunday specials for $5 is decent. Also great patio to people watch."}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoyed brunch at the brownstone.  Not one of us was disappointed with their selection.  The service was attentive and polite.  They atmosphere was cozy and relaxed with the nice touch of exposed brick walls."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant on three occasions, most recently yesterday for Winterlicious. Each time I visit, I am impressed by the restaurant's decor and friendly service. The owner(?) is an especially likeable guy and has, on a previous occasion, waived off a drink from our bill due to painfully slow service. It was a very nice gesture that I cannot forget.

I like the quality of food here. So when I saw it listed on Winterlicious, I gathered my colleagues and the six of us ordered various combinations of their prix fixe lunch specials. I loved their smoked salmon appetizer that came with some beet horseradish - it was smoked to perfection, very artistically presented (or maybe it was just thrown haphazardly, who knows, but it worked for me) and came in a decent amount. I would give it four stars. I was looking forward to the next items.

Sadly the rest of my meal went downhill from there. The main (vegetarian lasagna) tasted like it was just defrosted in a microwave and put on my plate. It could use some more cheese and bit of garnish. I must mention that their simple sesame-lime tossed salad side was tasty. The dessert (blueberry mousse) was a complete shock and rather disappointing; in retrospect I should have sent it back. When you say \"blueberry mousse\", it conjures images of whipped egg whites or cream and blueberries; what it doesn't say is a scoop of icecream and blueberry sauce on the side. Had this been clarified before, I'd have opted for something else.. (I dont quite like icecream and I love mousse).

However, since my friends at the table (who ordered tacos for main course and either banana tempura or apple crumble for dessert) enjoyed the food and also because I had a good time on previous occasions, I am encouraged to give it a good rating.

As for the winterlicious menu selections that I had, two stars would be generous.

{"text":"So so. The drinks are fairly priced. Service was great. The starter portions however are very small. We ordered a fried calamari appetizer and found the $12 dish to not only be small, but disappointing too. Half the plate was full of mixed greens. We ordered calamari, not a salad, but that wasn't what we got. The calamari that was included wasn't enough for two people. Not a great place for a casual drink and snack."}
{"text":"One of the most friendliest neighbourhood bistro, amongst my top choice of a summer patio kind of spot in the area.

Had a huge platter with couple of friends, I'd say enough for for people to share happily. Price was very reasonable for what quantity and quality it was.
Always very quickly seated whether it's for dinner or brunch.

15 tables inside and 10 tables on the patio.

Right on the corner of Yonge and Gloucester, great spot to people watch and just chill with couple of people or an iPad.

I like their decor inside a lot more actually, intense painting by the inner round table and just the mature vibe at the bar. 

Overall a place to count on if you want a drink after work, chill with friends with some good bites to eat or get a steak for yourself, our y bring a laptop or book for a sunny afternoon under the umbrellas."}
{"text":"I was wondering the streets with my sister for a place for Sunday brunch and we walked by this place, decided to try it and as we walked it were greeted right away and asked if we had a reservation, we did not. However the greeter was able to get us a spot within a couple of minutes. 

He somehow ended being our waiter as the others seemed to ignore us (that is the only reason I didn't rate a 5, would've been a 3 but he was great help). The speed to get our meal was very fast and very yummy!

I had a spinach cheese with poached egg (don't remember the item name), delicious!!!!! Every bite was phenomenal!  It also came with a green salad wi a nice light sauce. 

My sister had a French toast with portobello and chicken with a poached egg. She enjoyed it a lot. Also included a similar salad. 

I will defiantly come here again, maybe with a reservation and see if we get an actual waiter/waitress. But the greeter (who seemed to be a manager) was top notch and made up for the poor waiting staff. The only time a waiter came by was after I paid and looked at me funny because the receipt wasn't in the book... The greeter already took it."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious and it was awful. The server was rude, inattentive, grumpy. It took over an hour for our first course to show up (and it wasn't busy... the place was half empty) And when the food did show up it wasn't great. Sirloin was tough, fatty mostly inedible with flavourless gravy. The dessert options we ordered: chocolate moouse that tasted like a snack pack. Creme brule that tasted like eggy marshmallows?? The cheesecake was the frozen grocery store variety. Ick. Definitely won't be back!"}
{"text":"I came here last night for a drink and app before a play, and returned after the play.  It was a Tuesday and magically the beer I ordered was on special for $4 a pint!  The apps we got were simple (fries and magic mushrooms) but amazing.  But even better was my sweet and charming server Nate.  The owner (killing myself because his name is escaping me) was also a doll.  Hardworking guys who seemed to love what they do. But Nate....attentive, charming, and witty.  Good vibe here also!"}
{"text":"Note: Based on my experience from Winterlicious

First, I made a reservation for 7PM but my group still had to wait over half an hour for the table. They definitely overbooked as the waiting area was small and overcrowded with people. They should've put a limit on the online reservation website.
Then, it took another half an hour for our appetizers to arrive after ordering. I ordered the warm goat cheese. However, my food came cracked and the presentation was definitely off. When the entrees came (took another 30 min. after appetizer), they were barely warm. My friend ordered a medium NY striploin but the insides were still too red for her to finish; it was redder than my so-called blue rare, which looked more like a medium-well. I had to substitute my chosen dessert for a lunch dessert (poached pear) because they were all out of creme brulee.
Definitely wouldn't recommend or come back."}
{"text":"New management, what happened!
The Eggs Benedict, the house once advertised as the best of Toronto, is no longer. A bouquet of fruit wedges and crispy home fries no longer complements the dish and the eggs were hard. I don't wish to think how other dishes are created, sorry to see this landmark loose the respect it once had for it's valued local and theatre clientele."}
{"text":"Terrible service and a less-than-enthusiastic waiter. We waited for a solid 15 min before realizing we need to wave the waiter to us if we wanted any hope of having our order taken. Waiter seemed surprised we called him and didn't bother telling us the specials for the night. He brought bread but somehow forgot to bring butter. Never introduced himself. Never came by to ask us how things were going after the food came. Food was okay, but nothing amazing and certainly did not compensate for the poor service.

Terrible. Never returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and good portion sizes.
Stingy with the vegetables a bit on the main (probably as a result of increasing vegetable prices in Canada).
Initial waiter was somewhat rude and abrasive (one who took the orders). The other waiter serving was was great.
Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was given a recommendation by a friend to eat here, but I was fairly disappointed. I went with two friends. The service was slow (it took a very long time to wrap up at the end, and they seemed disorganized when we were trying to pay). I have heard from many people that the service used to be better than it is now. Not having been here before, I can't judge, but I wasn't impressed. The dish that I had (one of the specials that I decided to try at the time) was decent, but it wasn't any kind of exceptional. The restaurant is not expensive in itself, but I feel that it was a bit expensive for somewhere with the quality of food and service that we received. One of my friends loved her (vegetarian) dish and my other friend was not a fan of his.

I would go back for the atmosphere with friends, (and to give it another shot- I know that lots of people really like it) but I am not going to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Man, I was sort of disappointed.
Places like this are very hit or miss. Sure, the food may look good, but the flavour is always off.
Prices are pretty high and the wait time was long. Also, for a restaurant, they sure picked some kietche-ass decor. Doesn't blend with the overall feel of this place. Not only that but their specials are also expensive. Doesn't that defeat the purpose?
I don't think I want to go here again.."}
{"text":"I tried the Brownstone today after it being recommended by the front desk at the Marriott.  I was a bit skeptical as I walked down Yonge Street, but I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the place.  It's well furnished, and has a posh modern look to the inside.  It's also very open, so you don't feel cramped in it (granted it wasn't very busy for a Wednesday night and I sat at the bar, which is small).  

I tried the grilled calamari as an appetizer, and you have to try it.  Much healthier than the fried style, and very tastefully prepped and cooked.  I also got the strip steak, and it was very good by any standards.  

The service was also very good and friendly.  My drink was never empty, and they even talked me up a bit.  

The only thing I would recommend is trading the paper napkins for something a little higher quality or linen."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I eat here very often as the food and atmosphere is just great. I had a previous 4* review for them due to the slow service, but they improved on it. Only good things to say about Brownstone."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see a Groupon deal for Brownstone Bistro since I was a big fan of their Monte Cristo back when I lived near Yonge/Wellesley. So, I was very disappointed when the waiter informed me they took that off the menu. 

I guess I should try something else on the menu - why not the Mushroom Benedict? Oh, and I'll have the $3 mango juice too! My friend ordered the California Melt, which I had before, and it seems like there's been a change in chef or something because it definitely didn't taste as great as before. The chicken was dry and my home fries were pretty burnt and for some reason mixed together with burnt roasted pepper (not a fan of that). My English muffin was burnt on the bottom as well, and the mushrooms were cold. The waiter didn't ask me how I wanted my eggs, but they came out pretty runny, the way I liked it (thankfully). 

The interior renovations were certainly gave them an extra star, but seriously, what happened to the food? 

I have one more voucher left for $40, hopefully something will change the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, amazing prices!! Ambiance is great and the owner is so welcoming. They have half priced bottles of wine on Monday and food specials throughout the week"}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant walking down Yonge St, it's super cute from the outside and the menu looked appetizing, so we went for it. 

Cute updated decor inside, a pretty good feel to it overall. We started with the Bruscetta and fried goat cheese appetizer which was delicious. 

The rest of the food was just okay. We ordered the pasta bolognese and a pizza. The pasta dish had two notable issues. The first was that they did not take the time to warm the dish they served it in so it turned cold very quickly, making the dish less appetizing than it could have been. The second is that it desperately needed more salt in the cooking process. It was extremely bland. It wasn't bad, it just was not stellar.

The pizza had a good taste to it, but it was clear that they do not have a hot enough oven to get the bottom of the pizza crispy. The crust had a good texture, but the middle of the pizza was almost soggy. You could not pick it up to eat it, a fork and knife were required.

The one other thing that through me off was the clash of certain things. The decor and the food menus were nice, but the drink menu looks like it was from a cheap dive bar. Colorful and laminated. The bathroom was nice, but the advertisements in the mirror were tacky.

I think they have potential to be a very great dining and drinking option, they just have a few basic hurdles to overcome."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here to eat!  I was extremely disappointed with my experience here.

I came to Brownstone for lunch with my co-workers.  We made reservations in advance, got there on time and we still had to wait 15 min before we got seated (which is a long time considering we were there during our lunch hour and had to return to work shortly thereafter)!  We all ordered the 3-course winterlicious lunch, save one of my co-workers.  And I cannot emphasize HOW LONG it took for the food to arrive!!  Some of my co-workers had a meeting at 2pm, and had to leave without eating anything because it took so long!  Which is ridiculous considering we were there for 1230!  

When we politely asked if they could speed up the service, the server simply stated \"oh this is normal.  It's winterlicious so we are really busy\".  So you're telling me you didn't anticipate how busy it would be when your restaurant signed up for winterlicious?  The server was also UNAPOLOGETIC - I didn't hear a single \"sorry\" uttered out of her mouth.  We had to ask repeatedly for our courses, take out boxes (because it was taking so long and we couldn't stay to eat) and our bill!  The server also forgot about one person's order (the non-winterlicious order) and just said \"oh - the risotto was MIA\".  We didn't even know what to say at that point.  Not to mention the food isn't even good.  Mediocre at best.

The manager came to apologize after, although the reasons she gave for the delay were the same and still unjustifiable .  She gave us 20% off our bill and free coffee and tea,  but considering there is a mandatory 18% gratuity for large parties, that discount actually amounted to nothing.  

I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN, and I suggest you do the same.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else!!!!"}
{"text":"They have deliciously crafted dishes, that are eclectic and diverse,  there's something for everybody. The atmosphere is casual chic, laid back and comfy. Bathrooms are clean. Staff very helpful. Try the sea bass  it's very good. Everything is reasonably priced. I'm knocking one star off because they could work on the interior to make it more romantic since they seem to be going for that vibe, not sure lol"}
{"text":"Brownstone is very cozy and has a fairly extensive menu.  They have soups, salads, appetizers, sandwiches/wraps, pizzas and pasta.  I had trouble deciding, but eventually found the calzone at the end of the pizza section and ordered it.  The portion was huge and it came with a Caesar salad.  Not bad for $12.  

The meal was good, the service was good, the atmosphere was good.  Nothing overly impressive about Brownstone, but a good experience overall."}

{"text":"This place is great for brunch or dinner. Their sangria is amazing, actually, all of their cocktails are. 

The food is delicious but a bit overpriced for the portions and complexity. 

One of the best patios in the area, shame it couldn't be bigger.

Eclectic mix of people always, last time there was 2 Yorkville princesses and across at the next table were two dudes who brought their hooker to breakfast. 

I've gone back many times, it's not cheap so it's a \"treat\" brunch compared to most places just over at Church."}
{"text":"There are a lack of places in this area to actually sit and have a bite to eat, so we opted for this place out of convenience.  Trip advisor eluded to a 4 star rating.  Well, upon being seated, both the table and my napkin were dirty, which was not a great start.

They have a vast menu, but the skill set of the kitchen seemed lacking, and therefore the food was not well executed.  I had fish and chips.  The chips were fine ( sweet potato fries ) but the fish was overcooked and greasy.  Sometimes, less is more, so maybe shorten the menu and offer quality instead of quantity."}
{"text":"I can't begin to say how impressed I am by the outstanding cuisine, and gracious service I experienced at this establishment. As a former fine dining server and pastry chef, I was blown away.  From soup to nuts , if you fancy yourself a foodie , you owe it to yourself to experience this bistro.
     Lobster risotto can be a crap shoot. The amount of work that goes into it makes it a trial for most restaurants. But the Brownstone Bistro surpassed my expectations with a Lobster risotto that most fine dining restsurants would have trouble surpassing."}
{"text":"Go for brunch. You will NOT be disappointed on the weekend here. Banana stuffed French toast and I recommend getting an order of chorizo sausage on the side. So yummy and filling. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious tonight and was not impressed. The service was terrible and our waiter was rude. The one star is for the steak and the atmosphere.

Service: 
From the moment my cousin and I walked in it took 5 minutes before anyone greeted us. When we were finally seated it was at a table that was pulled out into the aisle and we kept getting bumped by passersby. After taking our drink order we never saw our waiter again, having to flag him down to get his attention. At the end of the night he asked something related to the bill, but I didn't quite hear what he said. Turns out he asked if we wanted one bill, which we didn't, and so we took out our cards thinking it shouldn't be a problem to split them at the table since we ordered the same thing. When he walked over and saw that we had two cards, without saying anything, he abruptly snatched the bill up and went to print two separate bills. Yikes! 

Food: 
You can't beat $25 steak and I love crème brûlée, so I was excited for my meal. The goat cheese appetizer was good. The steak was nice too, but they didn't ask how we wanted them to be cooked. I like my steak medium, which it was, so I was fine with that. What I was disappointed about was the dessert! I came here specifically for the crème brûlée, and they didn't have it. Our waiter started listing off a bunch of desserts that were not on the Winterlicious menu and when I asked about the crème brûlée, he didn't give any explanation, he just said no it's not on the menu. I had a cold pear dish that wasn't very good. Needless to say my sweet tooth craving wasn't fulfilled, so we went to Moxies after for a white chocolate brownie and a bellini."}
{"text":"3.5/5

FILET MIGNON - 28.5 - 8oz beef tenderloin topped with wild mushroom demi-glaze
The beef was deliciously tender and flavourful. However, the demi-glaze overpowered the steak. Be sure to ask to have the glaze on the side so you have control on how much you want to put on your steak.


NEW YORK STRIP LOIN - 27.95 - 10z striploin
We ordered medium rare but we got medium, bordering on medium well. There was a strong char taste to this steak that was soooo good! However, since it's striploin, I found the steak a bit tough.

I wish they had Rib Eye as an option since that's my go-to for steaks.


LOBSTER RISOTTO - $25 -  Lobster meat, shallots and arborio rice topped with rock lobster tail

My favorite here! This was so delicious. Perfectly aldente risotto with a lot of lobster chunks in the risotto itself, plus a lobster tail to top it off! I'd go back for this alone!


FRUTTI DI MARE - 22.95 - Calamari, P.E.I. mussels, baby clams, scallop and black tiger shrimp in a garlic tomato sauce served over linguini

The pasta is homemade, but I didn't find it perfectly aldente. They gave a lot of seafood here, which is a win! Didn't see much baby clams, but there were a lot of mussels. Didn't like the tomato sauce that much - it was pretty watery (e.g. wouldn't stick to the pasta).


HOME MADE ANGUS BURGER - 12.95  - 8oz house-made AAA Angus burger
Considering it was sort of sitting for a while already by the time I got around to try this, I can only imagine how good it must be when you eat it fresh.

The burger is very delicious and you can actually taste chunks of steak inside.


AMBIANCE 
New interior is modern and trendy. It has a very welcoming feel to just sit down, relax and have a drink... or more (tip: they offer $5 Fridays Special for bottled beer).

They recently started offering Steak Night (from Fri - Sun, 4pm-10pm)."}
{"text":"Came by for drinks with a couple friends the other night...big disappointment.  Like other Yelpers have mentioned, the service was our main beef.  It was probably around 10pm on a week night, and maybe that's late.  But if you don't want to serve us at that time, then simply tell us you're closing.

We sat on the patio and ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was fairly unremarkable.  Our server let us know it was last call, and we ordered a pitcher of beer.  About 5 minutes into the pitcher, a server came out to start moving tables and tarping things up for the night.  A few minutes later the other server basically came by to tell us they were closing.  He kept a close eye on us from the doorway, and it made us feel very uncomfortable.  A few minutes later he came by to rush us along again.

I understand that since the patio is outdoors it can be tough to control the environment, but seeing a mouse darting around between your feet is just kind of gross.  Won't be back at this place again."}
{"text":"In my recent visit to Toronto I stumbled into this cute little restaurant. The food was ok but I was more amazed by the service! Especially by our Irish waitress, Rose. Not only was she super attendant, she was entertainingly hilarious. I was so happy with my visit there that I signed up for a Yelp account just to leave this review and recognize Rose for her amazing job. I'll be back in Toronto at the end of April and will definitely be coming in for a drink."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, attentive servers and delicious food! The bruschetta appetizer was perfect. We also tried the fish and chips and linguini carbonara and it was really tasty. Excited to go back a try out more on their menu."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the Brownstone in years, and I was pleasantly surprised. They have obviously had a reno at some point, so the room is much more modern and less worn than I remember it.

I had the quesadilla with honey ham, and it was so, so good! I wasn't expecting much since it's not a Mexican restaurant, but it really delivered.

They have a few beers on tap, and the service was excellent. In the summer, there is also a spacious patio.

I definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness; disaster from the moment we walked in the door. The service was terribly slow and they blamed it on the business being busy at that particular moment. Lame. We had to ask for everything from water to silverware. When the meal finally arrived, one of the steaks was prepared med rare instead of med well and had to be sent back. The veggies were way overlooked and rubbery. They offered us dessert for free, but we didn't even want to begin to imagine what would happen with with it. After 2.5 hrs, we waived our white paper napkins and surrendered and begged for our bill. Go somewhere else, anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went here last summer for summerlicious with my friend. Menu sounded delicious. The food was presented well, the patio had a nice atmosphere. But that night we both were throwing up. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for both brunch and dinner and I've got mixed reviews on this place.  As a brunch restaurant the place is great and the options are all delicious.  As a dinner restaurant, the food is good, but not great.  Their beer selections are also fairly limited for a place with a full bar.

I was here last night for a birthday dinner and my party ordered various meals including the top sirloin steak specials, pizza and I ordered the angus burger with fries.  The steak was good for the price, it's no Jacobs, but a great value for $16 nonetheless.  My burger however was very dry and tasted previously frozen.  The fries with my meal were also mega salty.  I'm talking more salty than Puff Daddy after he lost JLo.  All good though, I had beer right?  Well our server mixed up our order and gave us pints instead of pitchers and we had to get the bill adjusted afterwards.  No biggie, just a bit of a hassle and the price difference was huge. 

Overall I'd come here again for brunch, but this wouldn't be my #1 choice for dinner downtown.  They did have good service, which was nice to see.  Also they had a chalk drawing of the Yelp logo by their back wall, which was cool!"}
{"text":"Is it fair to write a review when you were so hung over that you can't remember all the details? You be the judge.
We stumbled in because: 1. we weren't legal to drive, so short walking distance was our limit; and 2. it looked far better than the fast food alternatives in the vicinity.
I recall being amused that some of the staff didn't look far better off than us, and this would have been the start of their shift, so a long day was in the making for the unfortunate crew!
I think the food was good because I took pictures of it and didn't delete them, which is what I do when the food sucks. I'm pretty sure I had the Big Brownstone Breakfast, but I can't remember what the other dish was. Nice picture, though.
The staff were pretty chill and had a good sense of humour, which goes a long way in life.
Was it a gourmet experience I'll never forget? No, because I already forgot it. Will I go back? Most likely, because I am sure to be in the aforementioned situation again some day soon. Maybe next time I'll be able to relate to you a story more germane than telling you about the squirrel than ran in the side door during deliveries. It was funny."}
{"text":"I just love the Brownstone! My wedding shower was held here early in June, and they did an amazing job. We did a brunch/lunch party with prosecco, and the guests loved it. The space looked beautiful, and the food was delicious (as always). Plus, the team is wonderful - many thanks to Mishelle, Alisa, and Giulia for making the day so special!

Ps. If in doubt, you can't go wrong with the eggs benedict! Also, gotta love the touch of the homemade muffins at the start of the meal :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have mostly come for brunch through the years and quite enjoyed it.  Well, until now.  First off, the place used to be PACKED at brunch.  Today?  Dead.  I don't know if it was because of Father's Day, but there was only one other table with people.  The place just looked...sad.

Now for the food.  I ordered one of my usuals, an egg white vegetarian omelette under their \"light\" section.  The meal comes with a green salad and a small portion of fruit.  The eggs weren't bad, but considering that it's a lighter choice, why bother using a THICK, CREAMY salad dressing?  I don't care that it's mustard-based.  A light choice should have a light dressing. Oil and vinegar isn't hard to make.  My husband's eggs benedict looked pretty standard.  As for the drinks:  the coffee was nothing spectacular.  We wanted cappuccinos, but their machine was broken and the restaurant was waiting for a replacement.  

Service was okay. Our server was friendly, but she had more of a diner vibe (you know, the ones who call everyone \"hun?\") than someone who'd work at a mid-range sit-down in downtown Toronto.  I did appreciate that she asked whether we wanted additional coffee.  Some places don't bother - even if they do complimentary refills.  

I really wonder whether this restaurant will be around much longer.  The menu hasn't changed in years and it just doesn't seem as good as it used to be.  Perhaps that's why it wasn't busy.  Oh, and they don't offer complimentary mini muffins at brunch anymore. :("}
{"text":"Had the Eggs Benedict and  it was wonderful..loved the atmosphere and had great service.  Looking forward to another meal when we visit again."}
{"text":"I came here during Winterlicious for lunch. I ordered the Bruschetta, the steak and fries, and the tiramisu. They had run out of Nanaimo bars, but that was fine, the replacement tiramisu was just as good. 

My friends and I enjoyed our time here. Though our waiter seemed tired and was not overly enthused about serving us, the hostess was super nice and friendly.

The portion sizes were very good for the price, but I felt that the steak was slightly over-cooked and a little on the salty side. The bruschetta fell apart and I could barely taste the guacamole. 

Overall, this place is a nice place to meet up with friends. The decor was very nice, but the food was just above average."}
{"text":"I always get the locations for Brownstone and Volo mixed up! But after having been to both I wouldn't complain too much if I did walk in to Brownstone thinking it was Volo. This has a more open feel about to it and I do like my restaurants not to be overly cramped up. 

I came in here on the second day they started a brand new menu, so our server and a manager (or someone higher up) were very excited to hear our feedback, suggest items and even invite us for a wine tasting later in the week. So in terms of all that, service was very friendly and being close to the Panasonic Theatre they understand the need to be quick as most people here probably go to a show right after as this is the best place for a meal within a 3 minute walk. 

I ordered the penne bolognese and had a bit of their 4 cheese pizza finishing off with the homemade tiramisu. Everything tasted great and came in very satisfying portion sizes. Had a sangria as well which had more of a carbonated feel than the sweet juice filled taste you get at some other places. So good marks for that as well especially for $6.

I believe the price could be a little cheaper but I doubt anyone comes in here for a cheap meal, there are tons of places on Yonge than can fill that need.

Overall a very solid place for a nice meal out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"So good! I've been for brunch quite a few times, the service is great, always very warm and inviting! The food is amazing! My go to brunch spot for cure! I'd recommend the mushroom eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Overall I liked it and would come here again. I've been here once for lunch and once for dinner. The decor and ambiance are definitely quality. However I feel that the cost for value could be improved. At lunch, I had salad/burger fare. The vegetables were fresh and the meal was good. More recently, I tried dinner and was not satisfied with my options. Both me and another in my party felt the same way...the food was OK, but not something we couldn't have just had at home. The chicken rose penne I had was FAR too rich, and I was expecting a full breast on the pasta, not just diced meat. I expect meals of this quality to cost around $9-$12, not the $16 I paid.

All this being said, the food was well-presented, I got a free refill on my soft drink, and the service was good. I will definitely give this place another try, but I will make it a point to be more discerning over what I order and ask more questions."}
{"text":"WOW - we walked in on a Friday night with no reservation and were seated right away and ordered wine and a caesar, which arrived in lightening speed. 

There was a very large table of ladies and we thought the service might be slow - to out surprise the service was outstanding. 

It was STEAK night so, that's what we ordered a JR Sirloin and  a NY with salad and a mushroom / toast appetizer. 

Well within 5 minutes our salad arrived and I kind of thought the salad would be on the same plate as the steak but not. So I pushed my plate aside waiting for the entree. 

The restaurant  was busy but not loud and had a great Friday night vibe ! 

Within 5 more minutes a server came over with two plates of steaks and we said they can't possibly be ours because we haven't received our appetizer yet. 

A couple minutes later the plates came back again with the owner and he said he forgot to order the appetizer. Not to worry....we'll skip the app'y. 
Dinner was amazing - Steaks cooked PERFECTLY and the salad and vegetables  were just fantastic !! 
Love that this place is a short walk from my place and it's so yummy !!"}
{"text":"The food, ambience and the draft beer options are perfect to enjoy the summer by the patio."}
{"text":"We walked in here based on Yelpers review and we were not disappointed at all, I highly recommend the spinach salad full portion the wild mushroom risoto you can add chicken if you want proteins . Service was great! Time between starters and meal was perfect. 

Awesome food awesome atnosphere music isnt crazy loud just how i like it."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Brownstone was based upon my walking by the pretty little restaurant and wanting to eat there based solely on aesthetic purposes.. of course, I did hope that the food would taste good. But for myself, a lot of 'the dining experience' has to do with 'ambiance' and/or 'atmosphere'. 

So, I had walked by the restaurant and when my parents came to town, we needed a place to eat asap as we did not have the emotional energy to fritter around side streets seeking out  a place. We walked to Brownstone and all decided the menu looked acceptable for our taste buds that night.

I love this restaurant when it gets dark out and they turn the lights down! It is cozy, romantic and intimate. The first time I ate with my parents there, it was wonderful and brightened all of our dreary moods. I have since eaten there a handful of times, and am never disappointed. The staff is friendly and helpful. I have never, ever felt rushed whilst dining here despite the fact it can get extremely busy. At many restaurants, this is the problem I experience: it gets so busy that the servers/staff want there to be a 'high turnover rate' in regards to customers so as to keep the waiting people happy, get more tables through, etc. This is something I cannot stand and it kills the dining experience. I have never had this problem at Brownstone, they allow me and whomever I'm with to take our time, regardless of whether or not we keep ordering food, etc.

The open-faced veggie sandwich is so good, even without the mayo. The fries and sangria are also top-notch."}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped cheese stuffed pork chop special was better than it sounds if that is even possible. The atmosphere was good, friendly staff but the only negative is they seemed to be fairly understaffed."}
{"text":"After a little trouble finding parking for the RV, me and the fam pulled into Brownstone national park mid afternoon on a Saturday and were immediately impressed by the ultra-modern looking registration area. A camp counselor greeted us right away and told us to set up shop wherever we liked! Comfy seating and basic roofing meant we could leave the tent in the RV for another time, which was a huge bonus because honestly, as much as I love the wife, she's like a soggy taco shell when it comes to holding stuff.

Earlier in the week we were razzin the kids about making them sleep outside the tent with the bears! Haha. Hell, it got them to do their homework, brush their teeth, groom one another, etc. Unfortunately, the camp employee we spoke to said they only had beef, chicken and fish up there most of the time. Shame. 

As our first night at Brownstone wore on, I decided to leave the roofed area and take in some of those pearly white southern Ontario stars! While outside I met a LOVELY fellow camper by the name of Big Dwayne. Big Dwayne if you're reading this.....I want you to know that you made me feel something I've never felt before. Also: \"TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT WIGGLE WOGGLE ZAM!\" ;) Hahahahaha!

Overall me and the fam had a great weekend at Brownstone park. After that first night we weren't allowed back in the roofed area, which was f-i-n-e by us since fresh air is the elixir of the Gods! I'm not sure what that Amanda H is on about. Sounds like she thought she was at a restaurant or something and her and her friend's steaks got switched. Then they sat there like a coupla dum dums and ate each other's steaks and complained. ROTFL. 

P.S. Try the special camp drink \"Delirium\". The kids were out like lights by 6pm, and still haven't woken up! Cheers! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday evening,  and was greeted with a grumpy waiter. The Cozze in Padella was delicious,  but the Magic Mushroom was far from magical as the cheese and the bread were dry.  My boyfriend got steak dinner, which was decent but portion was small.  It has a nice patio which is the only reason I would ever go back.  There are many places in Toronto with  better food and nicer patios for the same price."}
{"text":"Ordered smoke salmon linguine via foodora and it was good .. they even included utensils .. good job"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Great staff. Delish selection and very comfortable environment.  There is something for everyone.  My daughters ( 9 and 11 yrs) had the best chocolate chip pancakes, while my husband and I had more unique dishes. The spinach soufflé was incredible!  Prices very reasonable.  Would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Would I go again? Nope. 

Service: server was great but he felt harried and rushed.

Chipped water glass: not cool

Summerliciois menu
Food: spinach walnut Gorgonzola salad; nothing creative just all the above and berries thrown on a plate. Yummy by default
Main: lemon chicken. Truly delicious, flattened breast that wasn't dry and was flavorful throughout. Enjoyed the presentation as well
Dessert: we shared all 3: tiramisu tasted like it had sit in the fridge too long or just been defrosted; lady fingers dipped in coffee and called tiramisu.
Creme brûlée: nasty texture, not good at all
Chocolate mousse: had everyone forgotten how to set a mousse? It was runny and unappealing."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there during the Pride parade and World Cup so it was fairly busy. Our waitress was serving us inside the restaurant along with a full outdoor patio - while several indoor servers were standing around. Needless to say, placing orders and receiving drinks was slow. 

We both had the eggs benedict off the brunch menu. It took a while for the food to come out and mine didn't have enough hollandaise sauce. For the price, I would not get it again.

Atmosphere wise, it was very lively. The Pride Parade along with the World Cup made the restaurant fun and enjoyable. 

All in all, I would like to appropriate the mishaps in service and food quality to the parade and world cup, but something tells me it was more then that. Would I go again or recommend it? No. Would I blame someone for trying it out? No."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were here for the steak night on a Friday night. I really liked the atmosphere, it's dark, candle lit and has good music (it was Christmas music at the time). The seating beside the window is the best, especially if you like to people watch. The service was great, we had a female waitress. I ordered junior sirloin and my boyfriend ordered BBQ chicken pizza. The food quality was great. 
The only pointer I'd make is, the food took a while, about 45 minutes, which I found was too long but I'm not sure if it was because of the steak- I ordered well done. Overall, great place and lots of selection."}
{"text":"The service is very slow and a little but clumsy , i went with my wive a couple of friends with his baby to have brunch last week.Somebody told us that the food in this restaurant was great sadly it was not.

As soon as we enter we were greeted by a server that kindly told us  there was no space for us in the patio, i suspect it was because of the baby as people was coming and going to the patio with no server telling them  there was not space.

The server was slow but it was not her fault as the place was busy at the time. We ask for a jar of water but we got 4 glasses instead. I order a diet coke and me and my gang were was refilled only once in more than an hour

Im going to speak about my food and not about the for of my companions. I order something call la casserole ,i was greasy hashbronw ( that i can do better on my kitchen )with bacon an 2 scramble eggs that were barely cook ,on a side they gave me fruit that looked old and without any flavour.

I will not come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Great sample appetizer dish, the calamari was huge! We also got a pitcher of beer to split between two of us which was $16 and equaled out to give us 4 beers total. It was a great stop for a mid day snack their other menu items looked great too. Not high end but a decent stop."}
{"text":"I love going to Brownstone for brunch. The quality of the food has greatly improved over the years.. the service is excellent the eggs benedict are my favourite. The home fries that come with the eggs benedict have some nice spices to them."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE !!!!! HORRIBLE !!! Worst place I've ever been to. 
I ordered
SALMONE AFFUNICATO
CON FRITTELLE
Crispy potato with smoked salmon,
mascarpone cheese, red onions and capers. I got a crepe with mascarpone cheese ONLY.  Didn't have any crispy potato nor smoked salmon. I should have actually taken a picture. I wanted to tell the waitress but she had disappeared. So after 10 min of waiving at the manager there he finally came over. I told him about the salmon (at the time I forgot about the crispy potato but I was sure the thing should have salmon because it's called SALMONE). So anyways the manager says he'll bring me some salmon to add to the crepe. And he actually did bring a plate with few salmon slices. Like really what kinda service is this??? 
And here is the best part at the end he asked me how was my food. I told him it was ok (I should have told him terrible) and that it had too much cheese. So he responds back by saying \"cheesy is good\"!! I live in the US and I was visiting Toronto for the weekend. I was very disappointed because you would never get this kinda service anywhere in the US."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on early Saturday morning at 10 am. There were only 3 tables full, so no problem in getting a seat.

I ordered the la casserola (fresh made hashbrowns au gratin style with vegetables and fresh fruit on the side). Portions are not big but enough to fill you up for under $15 after tax. 

The ambience is cute for a bistro styled place on Yonge Street. We had a window seat, so had breakfast overlooking the street.

Service was attentive with water being refilled instantaneously. I did not order coffee this time around, but will definitely come back, order another brunch order and coffee!"}
{"text":"Very hungover and tired me the bf and a couple friends decided to give it a try. I like the atmosphere, its very laid back and calm. Our server knew alot about the food which was good cause its fairly large. I had a wrap (cant remember which one) and it was actually really good. There was some sauce in it that was just fantastic!  Everyone was satisfied with there food and not just because we were starving, but it was pretty good. I would like to go back and try some other stuff and see what other amazing flavours will come about in my food lol"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised with this place. They have a really nice secluded patio just off Yonge street and they have really good food. I had their lunch special which was an open faced chicken sandwich with a whole wadda stuff and it tasted magnifico. Also tried their tomato soup and it was much better than what I expected (although I wasn't pleased to be unexpectedly chewing pieces of garlic and dried leaves). The chicken and shrimp kebabs were well made and tasty too. The service was a bit slow but the owners / staff were friendly and hospitable. Although this place might be a couple dollars overpriced, I'd say it's one of the better places to eat on Yonge street.

Lunch for two came out to be appx $29 - no drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past and have generally had a good experience; however, I came for brunch on Sunday and I was quite disappointed. 

In the past I have often ordered the mixed house greens salad (tomato, cucumber, red onion and shredded carrots, tossed in our famous balsamic dressing, $10) and have asked for it to be topped with grilled shrimp (it's not an explicit option listed on the menu, but you can ask for it, $5). It's typically a pretty good dish that I enjoy. This time I had a number of issues with my experience at Brownstone Bistro

1) There were ice chunks in my shredded carrot! (I think there's enough said with that)
2) $5 for 3 measly pieces of shrimp seems quite excessive, especially when the shrimp were not very good. I don't know how they were cooked, but it tasted as though they were soaked in butter or oil. They were not very good.
3) Out of green tea - how does a restaurant run out of green tea for brunch?!
4) My dish did not come with fruit but my friends' did. I noticed that they received much less fruit than they had on previous visits.
5) Our server was rather slow and inattentive especially towards the end. We ended up sitting around waiting for our bills for quite some time. It wasn't too bad because we were having a good conversation, but It would have been nice had she checked in on us sooner.

Overall a disappointing visit."}
{"text":"Place is amazing from brunch ! Great patio and awesome food  . Also Patrick is an amazing server  he takes great care of you :) highly recommend this spot in town !"}
{"text":"After we escaped from prison at the riddle room down the street,  we needed a place to grab a drink and watch the tail end of basketball game. We happened upon brownstone which had a buzzing patio and 5 empty seats at the bar. Looking around,  I could see that the restaurant was very modern and displayed great at work. We were greeted by very friendly staff despite it being very close to closing time.  We were served our drinks immediately and with style. One of the guests in our party didn't enjoy their drink,  and the staff were kind enough not to charge for it.  Overall I'd come back,  especially for the recommended brunch!"}
{"text":"I came here for Brunch with the wife for my birthday Brunch and we sat outside.  I walk past this place all the time and always see it busy and wanted to know what the buzz was all about.

Came during the week on an afternoon and sat on the gorgeous patio that they have Ordered a BLT with fries and a beer as well wife ordered the same minus the beer. 

Food came promptly and was really good fries were crisp and fresh and the BLT was great.

The server we has was excellent so i find it confusing when i read that the service was bad as ours was really courteous and funny.

Overall great atmosphere and experience will definitely be back.

Keep up the good work after seeing you guys on restaurant takeover i like seeing local businesses thrive and especially ones that care about their customer base and not all about making money."}
{"text":"In search of food, my sister and i set off down Yonge from our hotel, looking for that just-right combination of eggs, meat, and potatoes to set right the damage we'd done the previous night while fending off TFC and Blue Jays fans at another pub.  Cussing out the 28oz sippy-cup of Carlsberg at the soccer game the night before, she was in no mood for a long walk, so unusually enough i made the executive decision to try one of the first places we saw.

Happily enough, the Brownstone was a perfectly fine choice, with a slightly frazzled waitstaff doing their darnedest to keep people fed (the fourth star is for taking away empty, tiny Coke glasses and bringing us big tall refills; a cold Coke is awesome for a hangover).  The food selections are a mix of typical and atypical breakfast fare, and everything i had was tasty.  I don't know what typical prices are, but it was moderate to expensive, i'd guess.  

In short, we left recharged, refueled, and would have been ready to start drinking again, if it weren't for the 9-hour drive home after the Sox-Jays game."}
{"text":"Even good during their \"restaurant week...

We happened into the Brownstone Bistro during a \"restaurant week\" type of deal where the food is discounted across town at lots of places. Often this means staff are harried and the food is not as good. In this case we really liked what we had and the service was friendly and attentive. We both had a chicken dish with vegetables, a Chardonnay and an iced latte. They added in an 18% tip and made sure to point it out. In total we paid $92 CAN and it was well worth it. If we had had more time we would have gone again."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times. Decor is nice (should be,I'm pretty sure it was on one of those restaurant makeover shows). Menu is fine. Price is average for downtown. 

This time we arrived at happy hour. The server was friendly. There were only one other table outside (where we sat) and another inside. The drinks were average but fine. We ordered the spring rolls and coconut mussels. Took a long time to arrive. Once they did, the mussels were tepid at best. Most shells were empty (and only 2 or 3 on the bottom of the bowl, so that was odd). Sadly the creamy broth had the consistency of undiluted canned cream soup. The flavour was okay but how do you eat mussels if they're cold and so is the sauce. I felt as though I'd been served someone's leftovers that had been sitting in the bus pan for 20 mins before arriving at my table. I finally realized that just because appetizers are half price, I shouldn't settle for sub standard food. So I explained the situation to the server (who was very nice about it) and he took them back. Awhile later he brought back (what looked like the same bowl, which is fine) and it was only lukewarm. I was tired of waiting and having to send it back again for a $5 dish. For a well situated restaurant whose prices aren't cheap, I would expect to have my food arrive warm, if not hot! The fries that I had ordered to dip in the sauce (at the server's suggestion) were fine. And hot. Disappointed overall."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

Brownstone has amazing homemade ravioli- if you're there and it's the mushroom ravioli on special then you're really in for a treat!

Really great service. Variety of menu options. AND, they also do a FANATASTIC brunch!

Super happy hour specials for half-priced apps. Peach Lemonade is a wonderful summer patio treat!

Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"this was a real mediocre restaurant at best. the food was ok, but nothing special. the menu had a good variety, but nothing really stood out. 

i ordered the veal Parmesan and i was not impressed. there was too much pasta and the veal was too thin. my girlfriend ordered the pizza. it was a thin crust, but not enough sauce. 

it wasn't busy, but for some reason the food wasn't coordinated properly. the mains were brought out while we were in the middle of the appetizers. 

otherwise, the atmosphere is nice. there are lots of windows and you can face Yonge while you eat."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for Summerlicious. The ambience was romantic and classy with chandeliers hanging down their veining and dimmed lighting. Very convenient to get to by subway as well, right outside Wellesley station.

The only downer is they took about 30 minutes to deliver the food. 

As for the Summerlicious menu ($28) I tried the:

Appetizer
Wild Mushroom Devil's Toast - tasted very fresh as you can see the the cheese stretching out as you take a long bite into it. 

Entree 
Orange Panko-Crusted Salmon
Couldn't taste any orange but the salmon was deliciously cooked and the rice was on the crispy end with added salt. I like my rice crispy and salty however some of my friends found it to be a little stale.

Dessert 
NY Cheesecake - how can you go wrong with this? I love how smooth and creamy this cheesecake was and didn't taste as though it was taken out of the fridge. 

Drink
Just tried their virgin Caesar drink (sorry Yelpers, I don't consume alcohol) which you can also not go wrong with. 

Overall a good experience. I'd stop by here if I'm ever around Yonge and Wellesley in the future."}
{"text":"We had the mussels and they were absolutely delicious! A very unique sauce, and the bread it came with was amazing! Friendly staff and a nice looking restaurant, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"So disappointed!! I went once for lunch and it was pretty good. Came back for dinner and we were pretty much ignored all night. Our food was awful and we told the server but he didn't care at all. He joked and said he would discipline the chef and walked away. For a 100 dollar meal for 2 we were not pleased at all and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great ambience creating a very lively atmosphere. I enjoyed my time at Brownstone and was there for the steak night, great deal on the steak and shrimp. I would go back there again."}
{"text":"We've been here tons of times for brunch. It's our go-to spot when we are meeting friends. The staff are so friendly and the food is incredible!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner for the first time tonight - made a reservation as it was Friday night - busy place - nice atmosphere - good service - enjoyed Bruschetta, salmon, stuffed chicken and pasta primavera!"}
{"text":"I ordered Zuppa Di Pesche which is including all kinds of seafood. It tasted really good but totally not enough for a meal even for me, a little girl!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Toronto we ate here 3 times and each time we were not disappointed.   They introduced us to Mill St organic beer and the steak special was excellent, also beet salad very, very good.   Hamburger for my husband and salmon entree for me, both  excellent.   Staff very helpful and location great using public transportation."}
{"text":"Had a great burger here last week. Service was prompt. Food arrived in good time. Side salad was large and excellent. It was all good."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard neighbourhood joint. It's a solid, low-key place for dinner if you're in the area and want something nice-ish but not expensive. I came with a friend who recently moved into a nearby condo. Immediately, we were warmly greeted by this guy who we *think* is one of the owners. He showed us to a table on the patio and came back a couple of times during the evening to make sure everything was satisfactory. He remembered my friend's name and treated her with such familiarity that at first, I thought they knew each other from some other context. Turns out, she had only eaten there once before! I'm not sure if he is this nice to/remembers everyone or if it had more to do with the fact that said friend is gorgeous. I like to believe the former though:) 

Upon his recommendation, I tried the homemade meat lasagna. It was really, really good. The noodles were light and thin, not too dough-y and the sauce was hearty and flavourful. As a starter, we shared the veggie spring rolls which was tasty. They have a reasonable selection of affordable wines by the glass, 1/2 litre, or bottle. They also have 'martini night' on Thursdays. We were actually there on a Thursday, but our waiter didn't tell us about the martini special (I only found out when I looked at the website later). 

The inside area is very pub-like, with TV's playing sports. The patio is small but nice. Just do NOT sit on the tables along the side of the building because there are bird nests above and well, you have to be careful. A piece of bird poo just nearly missed my friend's plate. After that we moved tables to one that was along the street side."}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends and I wanted to go to Bar Volo but it was packed so we walked a block north to check out Brownstone.

We were greeted right away by the waiter and he was very friendly. We took some time figuring out what we wanted and he never rushed us. We only got drinks so I can't comment on if the food taste good or not but from the other tables, the food looks good.

Overall, this place is good."}
{"text":"Ok, so I have had a serious change of heart about this place that I used to love.  Went to Brownstone on 10 September 2010 for my birthday/ anniversary.  The server was rude to not only to us but also the table next to us.  I could have forgiven the serivice a little if the food had been good, but alas it was not.  Started off with a pitcher of Sangria....tasted like cool-aid and no alcohol.  Then we got the baked goat cheese appetizer which was ok.  The next round was the caesar salad....not dressed at all....just lettuce and croutons in a bowl. Sadness:( We then ordered the filet mignon......big mistake.....ordered medium rare and got the cow still bleeding and moo-ing.....totally inedible.  Would have sent them back to be redone, but it took an additional 25 minutes for the waiter to show his face, so just left it on my plate until he finally came around.  He was completely unapologetic and an ass.  Finally got my bill and left.  The table next to us and one behind us apparently had issues too, but only one of us got the manager to actually come out and remedy the situation.....and it was not us:(  Extremely disappointing experience.  They are now black listed for the next year."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times. First time was a good experience, with good atmosphere (though a little crowded). The second time was during Pride, and it took forever and a half for our order to come, and the order was incorrect. It was very unimpressive and the food was made terribly. The third time I came the service was better, but the food was still unimpressive. I feel like the quality has definitely gone down over the time and won't be giving this place a fourth chance unfortunately."}
{"text":"I would like to give two stars in order to 'encourage' them to maybe make things better but the super friendly vibes of the only server/bartender took away all my positivity. 

I went there with two of my friends on a Wednesday afternoon when the place had barely any customers. There was only one guy serving and making cocktails and cleaning the plates etc. From the moment we sat down, he clearly had an attitude. Maybe not personal, maybe he simply hates his job but we aren't here for that. 

I ordered a negroni. He gave me a cloudy cocktail on a tall pina-colada glass with a maraschino cherry and slice of orange garnish on a toothpick. I wanted to double check with him, since I've always had my negronis clear. He said this is how they serve it. Ok, whatever. 

We all ordered the same basic burger and fries on the menu. The patty was really tasting bad, like seriously bad. I had better ones in mc Donald's kind of bad. The pickles and tomatoes on it were at least fresh but patty is what makes the burger. So skip any kind of meat at this place. You will end up paying $12 for a Costco- or worse- quality processed thing. 

The service was pretty bad. This server really hates his job. Too bad. We still ended up tipping him %15 for his attitude. 

I will not go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I called in for a reservation and Jessica answered the phone. Very nice and suggested I come at 7:45 instead of 7:30 to avoid the huge theatre rush. 
Service was fast, our dishes arrived within 5minutes of ordering them. I had the Atlantic Salmon paired with a (suggested) Sauvignon Blanc. The wine was fantastic, and really paired with the freshly cracked pepper on the salmon. Raspberry vinaigrette was superb finishing touch on the dish. 
Cherry cheesecake was very good and the espresso was nice as well. Dinner was a little bit better than dessert though. An excellent dinner all around though."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing extraordinary, nice place the service was ok but the waiter was snobby and did things that we didn't ask him to do and it was kinda annoying."}
{"text":"This is based on my experience there during Winterlious.  I would say never go her during Winterlicious.  They over booked reservations so decided to completely disregard them.

I called few days before to make a reservation and was told they were really booked up got a 7pm reservation. 

Arrived at 6:50pm to the Brownstone and there was lineup of at least 20 people.  The weird thing was no one ever asked you to confirm you name, or reservation time.  They were basically taking people on a first come first serve bases.  Which was very aggravating especially since people were cutting in line.  Which if they had your name on a list or given you a number as you came in then it would at least have been fair.  I had asked most of the people around me and most also stated they had a 7pm reservation.  The girl directly behind me had a 7:30pm reservation.  She was behind me though so that was fine since she never tried to cut in line.

It just stupid to take reservation and then not have them honoured.  Don't take reservation just say it will be first come first serve but then at least have a list as people enter.  It took about 40 minute wait before being seated.  They Never offered an estimated time to be seated or an apology for the wait.

The food was very good.  I had WARM GOAT CHEESE APPETIZER, NEW YORK STRIP LOIN  & CHOCOLATE MOUSSE.  The appetizer was very delicious.  I had wanted CRÈME BRÛLÉE for dessert but they had run out when it when were ready for dessert.  The mouse was good tasty though.  

The atmosphere was nice, the food really good.  Also considering price paid $25 for everything it was well worth it.  If it had not been for the complete disregard for reservations and the long line of people waiting they would have probably received 4 stars."}
{"text":"Our server (an older gentleman) was visibly annoyed when we initially only wanted to order drinks and not food. When I ordered a second drink, he didn't say a word to me in response.

We did end up ordering a sampler platter, which was very disappointing in terms of taste. At one point I dropped my fork. Without having to say anything, a [different] server delivered a new fork within 30 seconds, which is the only positive thing I have to say about the service.

Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were going to a show at the Panasonic Theater and wanted to grab something to eat before.  Brownstone Bistro was only a few minutes walking distance so we dropped in on a Saturday night. Mind you we did not have reservations but the owner Chris quickly accommodated us. We mentioned we were had limited time because we had to go to a show at 8pm.  Chris personally looked after us and ensured our meals would be ready on time.  He was phenomenal I can not believe the reception we received I have never been treated with such kindness of service. The food it self was exceptional the steak was cooked to perfection and the peppercorn sauce was to die for.  Everything was locally sourced and fresh! I totally will go back worth the trip to T.O."}
{"text":"They have appetizer specials on the weekdays. The sangria is tasty and the patio is nice."}
{"text":"Go for the half price apps. They are large and filling  so you can get away with ordering one or two as a full meal. My co-diners enjoyed the wine list. 

The deocr is minimal but clearly updated. The exterior now contrasts the interior, in an odd way. The serving bowls and presentation are beautiful. Be sure to order the half price chicken tenders app. to see nice plating. 

I unfortunately had a bad personal experience. This was my first time. I went with people who had been once before and wanted to go now that the restaurant had been featured on Restaurant Makeovers. I ordered the lobster ravioli (ravioli of the day) and while it was good, it wasn't noteworthy. I only ate about 2 ravioli though since I was full from my yummy bruschetta appetizer. When it came time to clear the table is when things went horribly wrong for me. Throughout our service our waiter was pleasant but very hurried. When he cleared our plates neither he nor I clarified if I wanted the remainder of my main packed to go. I don't dine out often but the times I have the waitstaff would usually see there is food left over (in my case, nearly the entire dish) and ask if I want it to go. At the VERY least, a good server would ask I had not enjoyed my dish hence, a nearly untouched plate. So sadly once the bills were paid, I realize I was not going to see my lobster ravioli. Rather than make a scene or demand a new dish be prepared (so wasteful) I filled out a comment card and learned my lesson!"}
{"text":"I came here for a leisurely lunch.  Nice atmosphere with interesting artwork hanging on the walls.  Food was about average, I had the house tomato soup and artichoke/spinach dip.  Satisfying, but lacking somewhat in flavour - I've definitely had better.  The service was snail-like, so definitely only go if you are not under time pressure."}
{"text":"This is our first visit to Toronto and we decided to stay on Yonge Street, Downtown. Day two, early evening we started our walking tour.  Our first stop was Brownstone Grill because it looked nice, modern and classy from the outside.  Inside we were pleasantly surprised to see beautiful chandeliers with modern dark brown decor.  They also have a very nice outdoor patio for the warm summer nights.  We were warmly greeted by the owner who offered me a tasting of their featured wine of the day.  I prefer a big red so he recommended the Argentine Malbec which I loved.  We plan on going back tonight for their mozzarella stuffed meatballs and pasta and perhaps something else yummy to eat.
The service was excellent and I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Brunch Review

VIBE

I got the sense that this restaurant bordered on diner/bar/fine dining. They have a nice bar near the entrance; cool leather couch seating in the back for a larger party, and then they have multi-coloured dinnerware that reminds of what you would find in a diner. Another diner-esque moment was when I had to dig through a metal basket for a mini container of milk buried below the peanut butter and jam packets. Sugar also came in packets, not in a bowl with a spoon. I have absolutely no problem with the mixed feel, though it made me wonder why there was no clear direction.

The restaurant itself is warm and inviting, and full of patrons. With so many restaurants in the downtown core, Brownstone must be doing something right if they can attract a full house.

One pet peeve of mine is dirty furniture. When I sat down I put my camera on the table and it got dirty. I did not realize that the table had not be wiped clean, and my camera got wet and dirty with sugar particles. Not a huge deal, but a clean eating surface is important to me.

FOOD

Menu

The brunch menu is large and it is split into 9 sections (Classic Breakfasts, Benedicts, Healthy Choices, Sweet Tooth, Omelettes, Soups & Salads, Signature Dishes, Sandwiches and finally, Beverages).

Prices

The food prices range from $6 (soup) to $16 (steak and eggs). Though most items are $13.

Sides

They do not have a list of sides on the actual menu, but you can certainly request one and they range from $1.50 to $3 (according to my server).

Coffee is $2.50 and you get free refills.

My order

After being told by several staff members that I should order the Grilled Chicken with Portobello, I went with their suggestion, but instead of a salad (comes with a salad) I asked for their breakfast potatoes with no onions. I also ordered a coffee and a smoothie.

Food Details

GRILLED CHICKEN AND PORTOBELLO: Chicken breast, portobello, mushrooms and spinach on French toast, topped with a poached egg and chipotle hollandaise $13

SMOOTH MOVE (smoothie): a blend of orange, strawberry and banana $4.25

COFFEE $2.50

MINI STRAWBERRY MUFFIN was complimentary

What did I think?

Coffee: I found the coffee to be too bitter, and had to use cream to tone down the bitterness.

Mini strawberry muffin: It was tiny (I took a photo of it with a milk container), but it was really nice and moist. A tasty little thing!

Smoothie: I thought it was too small for the price and also too sweet. I asked if sugar was added to it, and was told that no sugar was added (it was taken off the bill=good customer service).

Grilled Chicken and Portobello: Wow! As soon as the plate was put in front of me, I was in awe. Everything looked so perfect! Just the array of bright colors had me captivated. Also, before the order came out the chef came over to tell me that the potatoes may have onions on them, so he asked if I still wanted some. I said no, and decided to go with the salad after all. I guess my disappointment was obvious because the chef manually removed the onions from some of the potatoes and brought some out to me. How nice was that?! Very!

Honestly, I could not believe how perfectly cooked each individual element of my dish was....

Eggs were perfectly poached

Hollandaise was light and creamy and did not overpower the dish (sometime it could be too thick or tangy--hate that!)

The chipotle is not actually IN the hollandaise. They drop a teaspoon of it on top of the dish, so if you do not like your food spicy, you can easily remove it. I love my food spicy, so I happily ate it

The chicken was moist and without an ounce of fat!

The portobello was tender, but not soggy. I loved that the pieces were large so the earthy taste of the mushrooms did not get lost in the dish

Potatoes were in fact delicious. They are oven roasted with herbs and olive oil. A nice change from deep fried potatoes

The fruits were fresh and more importantly, there was watermelon! I love watermelon!

I usually don't eat salad, but this salad I devoured. Even the balsamic vinaigrette tasted better than most. Large pieces of tomato and cucumber was a hit for me since I do not like to eat plain leafy greens

The French toast was surprisingly a good conduit for all these ingredients. It was not too sweet or too soft for all these elements combined. It held its own, and for that I give it props.

The spinach was well-blanched and still had texture. It is easy to over-cook spinach, but it was neither chewy nor soggy.

I rarely finish every element of a meal, but at this sitting, I cleared my plate. Inasmuch as there were some minor hiccups, I am incredibly impressed by this meal. So much so, that I am already planning on returning this month with friends.

{"text":"Our hotel recommended this place.  Great food with stellar service.  I took a chance and ordered one of their virgin drinks.  It was called the \"RedMed Sour\".  It was a magical blend of help oil, orange juice, lemon juice, agave, and a FRESH-CRACKED EGG!!  This blend was terrific.  It sounds a bit crazy but it tasted great and not at all earthy.  Unique drink everyone should try!"}
{"text":"Nice and central. Wine was ok. The server was kind of strange. Food was pretty decent but nothing memorable. I wouldn't rush to go here again but I wouldn't be opposed to it. It works if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Walked by here a thousand times and finally went in for dinner. Great menu with lots of options and specials. I had the steak with lots of roasted vegetables and everything was delicious! The servers were attentive and the prices were reasonable. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I popped into Brownstone one Thursday night when Volo was too crowded - and though they don't have the same beer list, I was not disappointed! 

The service was a little slow at first, because they were quite crowded, and it was too the point that I wasn't super happy about it - but it's almost as if our server read my mind and started being more attentive! 

On Thursdays, they have martini specials - $6 2oz, $8 for 3oz - so I had to take advantage of that. I had the \"especial\" martini, which has espresso, kahlua, baileys, and... another coffee based alcohol... either way, it was absolutely delicious, to the point I had to have another! Then I mixed it up at had a $6 glass of peach sangria, which was also quite good, though it could have used a bit more fruit. 

At the end of the night, I decided to fill out a comment card, and included my name and email. By midafternoon the next day, that manager had sent me a personal thank-you email, as well as a free appetizer the next time I visit! This definitely put me over the top of \"impressed\" and I will certainly be back. I want my free appetizer after all!"}
{"text":"I love this place but the new girl they have there is awful. She does not know hot to socialize with people, she's extremely rude, and is just unaware.

Great food and great atmosphere and I've been a recurring costumer here for years and always very kind and fun but she needs to go!"}
{"text":"The food here is just unreal. I've come twice already, just for the ravioli. This last time I tried the arancini appetizer and it was heaven. My bf had pizza and it was superb. I seriously wanted to lick my plate. I even asked to send compliments to the chef for that amazing sauce (the ravioli one). It's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend.

Spinach Souffle ($14)
This was really good. A spinach and goat cheese soufflé topped with a poached egg, gorgonzola cheese, toasted walnuts served on a piece of French toast, and topped with hollandaise. Comes with mixed greens on the side. The souffle was super soft, and really tasty. The poached egg was made just right as well, nice and runny. All the ingredients went really well together.

La Casserola ($14)
A baked breakfast with homemade hash browns and delicious scrambled eggs with sausage, bacon and fresh veggies, topped with hollandaise. Comes with fresh fruit salad on the side. The homemade hash browns weren't the type of hash browns I had in mind - it seemed more like panko crust crumbs to me instead. This dish wasn't much of my liking as to me it felt like the hash browns should have been the star, but it was missing and I personally don't like fully done scrambled eggs (I prefer them slightly runny and creamy)."}
{"text":"I had just about the worst dining experience of my life here. Let me start by saying this was my first time in Toronto and I found the majority of the people in Toronto extremely nice and accommodating. On Sunday my two friends and I decided to have brunch at The Brownstone Bistro. Two of us arrived earlier than the third and were quickly seated by the host who brought water and some great muffins. 30 minutes later we had not even been asked if we wanted a drink, despite the fact that several other groups had been seated after us and served fairly fast. Several servers were coming around but we did not know who ours was since no one had been over. We finally got the attention of one of the servers and asked if we could order drinks. Without any apology, He told us he would let the girl who was our server know we wanted to order. He returned and said he would be taking care of us. We ordered drinks, one of which was a mimosa since it was brunch. At that time we were told they were out of champagne. My friend was offered a wine spritzer which he declined, instead he ordered an espresso. He was never offered another drink for the remainder of the meal.    By this point my friend was a little frustrated, at one point the server got in his face and asked if everything was okay. My other friend ordered a drink but was also never asked if he wanted another, despite asking me several times. If felt as if they were being deliberately ignored.

Then we placed our food orders. I ordered a crepe with apples and Brie. No Brie. I ordered it with Gruyere since another dish on the menu had Gruyere. No Gruyere.  Finally I settled on Swiss cheese. I also ordered a potato galette. When the food came, the crepe was very good, the galette was inedible. The sliced potatoes on the bottom were cooked but the top potato slices were either raw or dried out. Either way, I could not get through them with a fork or knife. Although the crepe was good, one crepe was hardly filling for a brunch meal. 

Finally when we asked for the check, the server did tell me he took my meal off the bill but when we asked to split it three ways he reacted like it was a huge problem and that he would have to go inside to do that, despite the fact that every other establishment that weekend had no problem dividing the bill. After arriving back at the table with a machine he preceded to calculate the bill by hand and charging everyone accordingly. 

At no point throughout the entire experience were any of us apologized to.  Not for waiting 30 minutes before we were asked if we wanted a drink, not for being out of champagne at brunch, not for being out of two main ingredients for two dishes. The part that is hard to describe in words is the attitude of this server. He acted offended that we asked him for drinks, he acted offended that my friend did not want a spritzer instead of a mimosa, and he acted offended that we wanted to split the check. The whole situation was uncomfortable and I just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"I went there today for winterlicious with some friends for a late lunch and I have to say that I won't be back anytime soon. My boyfriend got the salmon tartar which was okay, my only complaint is that the bread was super crunchy (though overall it tasted pretty good) but other than that I was severely disappointed.

I had a very gummy piece of something in my fish cake, and my chorizo sausage roll was fairly tasteless (except for the overwhelming taste of cheese). My boyfriends veil cutlet was pretty good though. 

The server seemed pretty bored and/or upset, I'm not really sure but I feel like she may have been having just an overall bad day so I didn't take it to heart (we're all human after all) 

Overall my experience was mediocre, I've had better and I've had worse. I just don't feel like I'd plan to go back there any time soon and even a spur of the moment idea would probably end somewhere else. I'd rather take my chances on another restaurant. 

Also according to all the men with us they have a very awkward mirror in the mens room, if you don't want to see all of yourself don't bother going in there, or maybe use a stall instead"}
{"text":"I've been here  for brunch and more recently, for dinner. 

For brunch:
They have the classic choices, \"healthy\" choices, omelettes, and the more enticing section....\"Our Signature Dish\". I like choosing from here because it gives me a better idea of Brownstone can do differently. I wanted to get the Spinach Souffle, but this was sadly sold out. Good sign? I'll bookmark that for next time. Instead, I got the La Casserola, because anything that includes \"bacon\",\"sausage\",\"hollandaise\" and \"scrambled eggs\" sounds like a winner to me.

La Casserola was served with some fresh fruit, small garden salad, and in a hot casserole plate. I thought it was quite delicious - there was some sort of crumbly, crispy SOMETHING on top that was just amazing. I'd put that on top of anything, and make a meal out of it. Also ordered a caesar for $5, and this made for a solid 3.5 to 4 star brunch experience. 

For dinner:
I came on a Friday night, when it was Steak night. I ordered the Junior top sirloin for $16, which comes with soup or salad. I ordered the salad, but my friend ordered the soup which was a chicken minestrone. Note - for some reason when we asked what soup they had, the server seemed unable to recall. They really need to brush up on that a bit. 

Steak itself was a small 6oz steak, which for me is a perfect portion. It came with an assortment of veggies, and you can choose the sauces (red wine + fig was my pick!) The salad was sizeable, but not filling - all green, all leaves. 

We had a bit of a problem with the bill, mainly because the server brought us individual beers rather than the requested pitcher - he then said he will just give us the quantity that we would have gotten in a pitcher, and charge us for the pitcher - didn't happen. He charged for all individual beers, which was at least $10 more than a pitcher. 

Overall, dinner was less impressive. 

Anndddddd just for reference:
All week happy hour 4-6pm
Mon 1/2 bottles of house red
Tues $4 pint of Mill Street Tankhouse Ale
Wed $5 sangria $17 pitcher
Thurs 1oz well drinks $4 2oz $6
Sun $5 Caesars"}
{"text":"We went for Saturday brunch in the afternoon. Their blueberry pancakes are delicious, moist and fluffy. Also tried their mushroom Benny which was a highlight for me! Side salad was nice but they had some wilted greens which were disappointing. Bottomless coffee was also great. Will return to try other brunch menu."}
{"text":"We made a reservation but we still needed to wait 15 minutes for our table. Service was just okay. The food was good."}
{"text":"I came here for an impromptu  brunch this morning with my friend. I've been here before for dinner as I only live around the corner from the restaurant. Brownstone seems to be very popular with brunch goers here in Toronto, the place was buzzing with people of all ages. The brunch menu is extensive and although I'm not a vegetarian I was surprised at the number of vegetarian options. I thought it was a really nice touch that while we were waiting for our food to come out, we were served what appeared to be strawberry friands, on the house too! 

My friend ordered the Brunch Spanikota and I ordered the La Casserola. The food was delicious and the service was good. I'll definitely be coming back again to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is a great well-run local restaurant.  It used to be a gigantic piece of shit until it hit one of those \"restaurant makeover\" shows a couple years ago, and thankfully since then it has not only seen the same quality if not better itself even more!

They often have good drink deals and daily specials, including steak nights and sangria nights that even better your value.  I often go to this place both with co-workers (I work close by) and/or with friends and it is typically a delight with either crowds.

I would say that the only downside is the quality of food - if you're looking for O&B style eating you won't find it here, however if you want a decent steak salad, sandwich, pizza, or baked pasta definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I love Specials!!

I never like paying full price!

I came to Brownstone Bistro meeting up a bunch of happy Yelpers for an UYE. (happy because they all started drinking before I got here)

Creemore on Draft sounded good. Waitress was really attentive and checked on us all through the evening!

Time to go home! And when I asked for my bill, $4.52?! for my pint of Creemore? I got a little confused until I got home and looked at their website..

\"Tuesday Creemore Night!!\" 

Now I am eyeing the Wednesday Sangria for $5 and Thursday Martini Night with Martini for $6!

And of course Happy Hour 4-6 pm!!"}
{"text":"It pains me to say this. Really, it does.

I had been in love with this place since I went for my birthday two years ago. Frankly, something has changed here, and it is definitely not for the positive. The service is awful, and the food often deviates from what is described in the menu.
 
After waiting over ten minutes to even be asked for our drinks and after I impatiently ushered the absent minded and forgetful waitress that we had been waiting for too long,  I ordered the salmon afficianto (sp) off their brunch menu and rather than being served a crisped potato pancake with mascarpone cheese, I was given a floppy eggy crepe like thing with a generous dollop of goat cheese (which I cannot stand the gamey taste of). 

The service is slow and actually quite frigid, I even caught one of the male waiters tying his shoelace atop the bar for any with a wavering eye to see.  Such a drastic change from the warm hellos and the personalized birthday card I received a few years back. I have also recently ordered the brownstone big breakfast and was sad to find that I was left unsatisfied and the portions quite small compared to how I remembered it last, for example 4 meagre slices of sausage vs what I recall as being a whole link. And they struck out 2 out of 3 for over cooked poached eggs, and I am one of those who is particular for well cooked eggs (I mean... when it comes to brunch/breakfast...terrible eggs = terrible start to the day, no?)

As a brunch place, this bistro fails miserably. I would much rather go to 7 West,  Cora's for their similar options and pricing, or (gasp) good 'ole Frans... or even to the slightly skivvy Coach House down the street, if I don't want to pay extra for the snootiness. I feel like overall, this place has become yet another \"kitchy\" place for tourists to overspend. 

This, has been my final straw with this place. I will go back once the prices reflect what the customers are paying for, or if management changes."}
{"text":"I was leafing through Wikipedia when I came upon this definition of a bistro: a small restaurant serving moderately priced simple meals in a modest setting. This will suffice for Brownstone. It's a cozy space with Mediterranean vibe that serves largely Greek and Italian cuisine.

It's located at the corner of Yonge and Gloucester which is just north of Wellesley subway station. The restaurant has lots of seating and its well-suited for groups. The deliberate lighting and casual atmosphere also makes it a suitable choice for a date.

The food here isn't too thrilling. I opted for the grilled (versus fried) calamari, and it was a bit dry and overcooked. It was served with a sweet sauce that helped somewhat. They certainly do better with drinks. There is a full bar, and there appears to be drink specials every day. $4 Creemore on Tuesdays, $5 Sangria on Wednesdays, $6 martinis on Thursdays, and happy hour from 4-6pm where you can get cheap apps with a drink. Me likey.

Though nothing blew me away about my Brownstone experience, I can freely admit that this is a small restaurant serving moderately priced simple meals in a modest setting.

Obligatory Title Pun: I've been dancing with Mr. BROWNSTONE.

Menu Readability: Not sure why they are leatherbound, but yeah, they have a menu.

Need to mention: They have a lovely south-facing patio.

What this place teaches me about myself: GNR rules."}
{"text":"I was here for a Summerlicious dinner. When deciding, I saw that the menu was only $28 and yet included a great selection of foods. Made a reservation on Friday for 8PM and I was promptly seated. 

We had Jonathan who was very attentive to us in terms of service and water throughout the entire meal. 

Here's a summary of my meal:
1) Warm Goat Cheese Appy: Basically deep fried goat cheese on toast along with two pieces of bruschetta. The sauces and toppings on the bruschetta was great - had a slight sweet tangy dressing that brought the bruschetta together. The deep fried goat cheese was also heavenly. Definitely a 5/5 in my books
2) New York Striploin: knowing that it is $28 for a three course dinner with steak, I know the steak can't be the best of quality. And it really is not - it's a tougher cut of meat and it's fairly small in portions for my liking. It was done medium without a choice - which is also unfortunate as I like my steaks medium rare. 3/5
3) Creme Brûlée: I love Creme Brulees. It's my favourite dessert. However, there were some serious flaws. There was still sugar that was untorched on my Creme brûlée as I can see the sugar crystals. That's unfortunate. The Creme tasted great and the parts that were caramelized was also great - but it's quite an amateur mistake for a Creme brûlée to leave parts untorched. 3/5

Overall, I had a decent meal and I enjoyed it - it's worth the price. However, the food quality was not as great as I hoped."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The setting is one of a kind!  We thought it was going to be tiny, but there are multiple levels to pick from.  We had a great time just sitting and talking as well as a great brunch.  

My only major negative was the menu. It's printed on flimsy paper that folds out bigger than a newspaper. That makes it very challenging for everyone to try to open and read. Also the picture interferes with some of the printing because it's dark ink over a dark picture. This is very minor, and just intended to be encouraging words of advice. 

PS. Make sure you stop and check out the washroom!  Again, one of a kind!!"}
{"text":"Town Inn Suites gave a free chef's appetizer to this place; the staff lead you on with menus hastily so you order the apps listed, thinking that's what this promo is. Another wait staff gave me the menu again after I ordered. Shame because the mussels were great but the wait staff didn't listen and are incompetant."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant nestled on Yonge Street. The service was good, the food even better and the patio was perfect for a summer evening with drinks and people watching. The butternut squash ravioli was amazing and the grilled salmon fresh and delicious. This is a quiet retreat from the gay village I block over and the tourist area of Dundas Square a few blocks south. I will be back to experience more if the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere, the food, the staff. I always visit this restaurant when I'm looking for a casual, comfortable outdoor patio to enjoy a tasty meal on a nice day. I had the sole there recently which is melt in your mouth delicious but honestly I like everything I've tried here."}
{"text":"Mom and I walked in on a Monday afternoon for drinks and appetizers and received terrible customer service. The place was not busy at all, the waitress took forever to bring our drinks. first the drinks were half made. martinis were half full and she said they would be more full if we ordered a double?? yeah because that makes sense! my vodka tonic had no ice and she brought me a full glass of ice after I finished my drink (10 mins later). I could see her in the back just standing around. 

terrible service! never coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place probably 5 times and every time it's just great all over - their menu, their specials, the atmosphere, the service. My favorite is the grilled calamari salad :)

Highly recommended, especially if you're looking for a patio in that area."}
{"text":"Sad to say this place was a disappointment tonight. The magic mushroom appetizer was cold and the mixed grill was sooooooo salty. This was not worth the venue for a much needed date night. I've been a supporter of this place for the past year but tonight's food (not service because they are great) will probably be the reason I won't come back again."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend before seeing Potted Potter..I chose the place based on Yelp reviews and I looked at the menu online beforehand. Good prices and I'm a pretty picky eater so to see a menu with a bunch of things on it that I could eat was nice! 

I liked the place right off the bat, the host and our waiter were friendly and I loved the atmosphere. The decor was very modern and there was cool art hung up on the walls.

We both got drinks, he got some wheat beer that he likes and I got a cesar (my favourite) a little smaller than usual but tasted very good.

We shared a greek salad, it was a good size for 2 and a good start before our meals came. 

He ordered some oven baked chicken pasta with rose sauce and I got the chicken marsala. Both were delicious and the portions were big and very filling. 

Would definitely come back here! Great location and there were a bunch of other things on the menu that I wanted to try."}
{"text":"3 of us went there with a voucher. We had appetizer, main course and dessert. The chef is a big fan of grilled red pepper (I'm not so much), every dish had quite a few except the desserts.The food was nothing memorable, but OK. The desserts are below average. The service was on the slow side although the place was just half full. 
We definitely liked the atmosphere. The place is very hip and modern with nice decor. Very trendy and chic. 
The front of the house was professional, friendly and charming as he escorted us to our table and explained the specials. I cannot say the same about the water, He was a kind when \"I hate my job\" was written in his forehead. The check out went smoothly with our coupon.
I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I love this spot! We first went there about a year and a half ago and was amazed by the staff and the goat cheese bruschetta lol. We get it everytime. Highly recommend it:) we've brought our friends as well and they all really enjoyed it. One little thing we noticed but appreciate greatly is they always seat you in the best spot available to make it that much better. :) our old spot on king we would go to for date night had great food and a romantic environment but the staff weren't accommodating. He was proposing to me that night and made a reservation for a good spot.. And they sat us in the worst spot between all these people. That's what made us not go back. But brownstone cares about the experience!"}
