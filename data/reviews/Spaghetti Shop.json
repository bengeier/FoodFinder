{"text":"Cheap. Quick. Tasty.  

Mediocre pastas, good sandwhiches.  Pizza Bread is money. Uncle Louie Sub is the best thing on the menu.  All you can eat pasta deal on Sundays (??)."}
{"text":"I live a block away from where the Spaghetti Shop WAS, and I can promise that this restaurant no longer exists.  It's been torn down, and a Burger King is going up in its place.  I hope that Yelp deletes this restaurant from its listing or recognizes that it is no longer an establishment.  If you're interested in Italian food in C-U, try Biaggi's or Bacaro's or Cafe Luna."}
{"text":"CLOSED FOR 3+ YEARS
Being replaced currently by a Burger King.
Burger King is now open along with other quality fast food joints and restaurants."}
