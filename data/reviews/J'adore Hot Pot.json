{"text":"2.5 Star The cooked food (deep fried mantou, skewers, takoyaki and dessert fondue) was surprisingly quite good and even better honestly than their hot pot offerings.  Meat was not the best, didn't have much of the ingredients natural flavour? Not that much variety on the menu to choose from either. For broth, My friends picked soy milk which was really thick and took long to boil, was not like a soup at all, and not that great tasting. Others had the miso one which was a bit sour from too much miso and salty. I had the mushroom one which was fine but likely due to it just being chicken broth base.. or that is what it tastes like anyway. So all in all the soups did not help with the taste. The sauce station was regular like others and good.  Main gripe about the place is how anal they are about their bday promotion. Staff have no idea what the policy is and kept having to go ask the manager and come back and forth. I went on Thursday and my friend's bday was the upcoming Tuesday. It's only 4 days away, within a week ....  but they said it had to be within the ACTUAL calendar work week for the bday person to have a free meal . Seems quite lame. Did however get the 15% off for entire bill and they allowed us to split bill and pay on credit card individually (shockingly).  Overall I prefer morals village and that would have been my top choice but figured to try this place out since reviews were good + the discount potential."}
{"text":"This is the worst hot pot I ever had.   My wife and me went there on Sat at 9pm.  My wife asked for Miso soup based and they out of it.   Me asked for diet or Coke Zero and they ran out of it.  My wife asked for watermelon juice and they ran out of it. We tried order for the food and some of them ran out of it.   Come on 9pm on Saturday? We stayed there for only 45 mins coz most of stuff out of stock.  Never recommend anyone go there."}
{"text":"This place has nothing to eat, including noodles. They ran out of food at 7pm.... but there was no customers there. All I had way just beef lamb and chicken, tofu and someone veggies. But the good side is, the beef was good. That's it's. Oh good customer service too."}
{"text":"AYCE hotpot with a high tea atmosphere. I came here for the buy 1 get 1 free grand opening promotion. Arrived at 5pm, but we didn't make it for the first seating. We were the first for the second seating and got a table around 7:45pm. By around 6:30pm there were more than 30 groups waiting for a table, hence, the host encouraged new customers entering to come back tomorrow or the following week and offered a $10 coupon. I thought it was a pretty kind gesture of them to offer.  We were told that there was a 90 minute time limit for eating so the host told us that the wait would be around that time. At around 7pm, everyone in the first seating was still eating. The host did not push anyone to leave. Many hotpot places actually set a timer, but they did not. Some people continued eating for at least 2 hours until they were asked to leave. For an event like this with so many people waiting, it would've been much better if they stuck to their time limit.  The host gave tables to people who didn't have their entire party here which was quite odd (should be first come first serve right?). Also, many pairs of 2 were given tables for 4. The host didn't allow the sharing of tables nor were the tables separable. They could've easily accommodated for more people. There was also a VIP room free until around 6:30pm when two girls were let in. I guess it was reserved for these TWO people?!? It was quite a big room that could accommodate at least 10 people. A lot of other customers and myself found it very weird that VIPs could make a reservation while normal people have to wait hours for a table when the promotion was FIRST COME FIRST SERVE.  Anyways, the soup bases were quite unique. I ordered the Japanese soymilk soup and it had a strong soya bean taste. The fish maw soup base was also pretty good - some herbal taste to it.  Some of the food (like meat and fish products) was much better quality than many other hotpot places for AYCE. The selection is similar to other places. The shrimp paste actually tasted like shrimp and the texture was great. The meat with cheese balls have no cheese taste but it did taste like beef. However, the veggies were not the freshest. The cabbage had a lot of black spots. The holder for the meat and other round plates made it quite difficult to get the food from the bottom and middle sections.  They also included bbq skewers for the AYCE. We ordered a few skewers but we didn't know that they were supposed to be heated up using the burner/heater thing on the table as the server didn't light it up for us. They were warm and we ate them as is. They were pretty good and well-marinated.  For dessert, they offered chocolate fondue as a part of the promotion. IT IS NOTHING LIKE ADVERTISED. We were given 2 marshmallows, 2 tiny pieces of banana, and 2 tiny pieces of donut. No strawberries, no melon like in the pictures for media.... The donut even smelled sour... didn't want to even touch it.   The servers mainly speak Mandarin. Some understand English and Cantonese, but still got a number of our orders wrong.  I don't think I would've come if it wasn't for the promotion."}
{"text":"Poor business practice, mediocre food. Giving 1 star because I will not be returning to this place.   If you're familiar with ayce places, there typically is a surcharge for weekends and holidays. Fine. This place charged a holiday charge because today was HALLOWEEN. We were told upfront and laughed and thought maybe there was something special. Nope. Same menu.   Like many hot pot places, there is an additional charge for soup base ranging from $4 to $8. Current new opening promo of 10% off, cash only. Remember to ask about this because it wasn't offered to us.   Decor is nice. Reminds me of dazzling but in blue. Wonder if they are related... Hm...   Food is mediocre. There are other places with much better beef. Good variety but low on quantity. They ran out of watercress although there were only 5 tables.  More flair than substance."}
{"text":"I love the interior design in here ! It's so fancy! It's like I'm at high tea but I'm at hot pot! I love how beautiful the decor and the colors of the wall are. The seafood and meat were very fresh! The veggies were fresh too. My Favourite part of this whole experience was the different soup base flavours they have. It's super unique the different soup bases my favourite was the miso sumo one. The menu was so pretty too ! I'll def be back here soon !"}
{"text":"Atmosphere 4/5  Food 4/5 Servers 1/5 Overall: 3/5  When you walk inside the decor is very cute and nice like a high tea place. I came with friends and had to be seated at two different tables, which was fine but it really wished we all sat together.   The menu is in Chinese so if you are a Floyd Mayweather of the Chinese world, you are out of luck. We were greeted by a waiter that is practically Squidward that hates his job and wants people to know he hates his job. If you see a dude with a smiley face tattoo on his right hand you might as well just ask for another waiter. It was worst than talking to a wall, because at least walls won't roll their eyes at you and ignore you. His service was so bad another waiter, Jaden, had to intervene. Then everything got better since this dude you can really tell he loves what he does and he even ask for our opinions and suggestions in the end.  The food was the typical hot pot stuff like meatballs, meat, veggies, and the deep friend rolls (yum!). I really enjoyed my meal and I would love to give it more than 3 stars but the first waiter really just blew it."}
{"text":"The food was good, quite different from your typical hotpot, the broth was quite tasty, and not covered in grease, unlike other hotpot places. I personally really like the idea of individual hotpots as you can customize the soup base that you want. I thought the miso sumo was quite flavorful and different from the chili oil base broths from your typical sichuan hot pot. Otherwise, no other complaints. The ambiance is quite classy for a hotpot restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried this place a while ago on a whim since we were tired of the competition. When we looked in from the outside, the place definitely does not seem like it serves hot pot at all. The French-inspired decor of blue and white panelling along with the high-backed chairs made the place look intimidating.  Food 2/5 Food is average, nothing spectacular or anything to write home about. I can't say that the food was exceptionally fresh or homemade (meatballs/fishballs etc.) so it's hard to want to come back for the price. I got the Tom Yum soup base which was flavour but had a few too many ingredients making it hard to cook any of my food. I do appreciate that the pots each come with a ceramic cover to protect you from touching the boiling pot and hurting yourself. I do want to note that some of the food comes out on 3-tiered trays commonly used for high tea. It was quite unnecessary but I guess they're trying to sell the experience and stand out from the competition. The thing that peeved me the most was the lack of portion control. I only went with my s/o but the server over ordered every single item that we asked for and the quantity was enough to feed 4-5 people PER DISH. I enjoy eating as much as the next person but we can't humanly eat for 5 so there seems to be a waste if this happens to all the other tables.   Service 2/5 Same as food, nothing to really write about...Service was mediocre, average at best. One of the servers did end up spilling water all over our table and took them a while to come and clean it up. Nobody was friendly or even asked us how we were doing - they simply delivered our food and walked away. I'm not asking for 5 star service, but even for a Chinese place there was little to no service.  I can only assume this place wants to be different with their decor but at least be consistent in that. The menus were printed a few A4 sized pieces of paper that was pretty mangled (probably due to excessive use). All in all this place is a little over the top for and seems more like a place for high tea than something that's supposed to be no frills such as hot pot."}
{"text":"AYCE Hotpot | Chinese menu only/ limited English speaking servers | LLBO | Good service  Nice new little hotpot place designed like an English high-tea place but serves all you can eat hotpot.   Mon-Thu: Adult prices $24.99, Children (ages 3-14) $12.95, senior (ages 65+) $18.95 Weekend prices +$2 each ON TOP OF THE PRICES LISTED ABOVE, each unique soup base is charged in addition to the per person cost depending on which you choose. It ranges from $3-$9. Soup bases though are quite nicely flavoured.  Selection of hotpot items are not wide but good enough. Quality is also decent however the menu is only in simplified Chinese. You may require assistance from a friend who can read it.  Items include your tofu selection, beef, lamb, ox tongue, pig's blood, vermicelli, red sausage, mussels, all kinds of fish/meat balls, veggies, mushrooms, noodles etc. No additional items for extra charge at the moment.  Currently giving out 10% off whole bill for grand opening. Tips not included in bill. Does have credit/ debit machine.  Currently have juices, pop and beer paid per order.   Service was good aside from the fact that communication may be an issue to some. Design is nice and modern. Still a cleanly renovated and bright restaurant.   I came in at around 8:45pm and they close at 11pm. My table was the last table by around 10:15pm. Last call was at 10:30pm. I saw that the servers were already changed out of their uniforms and waiting for our table. I personally didn't like that because it seems like they were really eager to leave so I felt bad staying although they do close at 11pm. They didnt push us to go but by 10:45pm they were sweeping around us. I understand where they are coming from and they were not too pushy but it would give the guests pressure. When we left all the servers gave us a warm goodbye each.   Overall, I would come back to this location if this kind of service maintains. I would like to see more items on the menu though."}
{"text":"This place has a certain feel to it right as you walk up to its doors. They chose a theme and colours and stuck with them. J'adore seems like it going for a fancier high tea setting but it's a hot pot place through and through. You pay your set fee for the AYCE and then you pick you soup base which is an additional price.   Be prepared to pick all you hot pot veggies and meat when you pick you soup. The server will be asking you what you would like all at once. We asked to keep the menu and we ordered as we went. The ordered the Tom Yum Soup base to be frugal. But then we added the plum juice, which wasn't available this time, they gave us complimentary pops but we sent them back to try their fresh pear juice. The pear juice is full of delicious pulp and corresponding froth that you get from a juicer. It was refreshing with the natural fruit sweetness that you expect from an Asian pear.   Everything here came out quickly. The portion sizes for the meat is quite substantial and even as we were nearing the end of the meal and wanted to add just a little something they accommodated us with a half order or quail egg (what service).   The highlight are the sauce station which I know can be standard but I still like the choices. The soup bases were good with our Tom Yum soup having both the spicy and sour notes that you expect. There isn't too much to say other than we were pleasantly surprised and would come back to try and have a lighter dinner so we can have the fondue dessert next time  I gave this place 4 stars because there isn't much that is wrong with this place so it would be unfair to give it a 3. But in terms of improvement those scoops would be a nice addition as would any communal chopsticks for the raw meats."}
{"text":"For all the glamour and class that this restaurant oh so proudly advertises itself to be, they definitely got their appearances down with the baby blue interior design, ceramic hot pot bowl covers, and silver high tea trays. The atmosphere is all there and even the customer service is great (with employees checking in every so often to ask about the meal).   Unfortunately though, I can't say the same about the quality or value of their food. After having tried a wide selection of items, my party of 4 collectively agreed that the dishes were all very hit or miss and overall, the food was subpar compared to other hot pot restaurants. Luckily we came for the BOGO promotion but at their regular price on a weekend? $27 + $3-9 soup base plus tax and tips? Noooooo thank you. There's MUCH better food to be had (hot pot or not) at that price!   Noteworthy, their \"handmade balls\" were all very unimpressive even though they should be the staples of hot pot. My table was very disappointed that the \"store bought\" fish balls were the only tasty ones. Further, while some of the soup bases were delicious (black chicken base and mushroom variety base), the miso base was ridiculously over-salted.   I guess the one positive that did stick out for me was the chocolate fondue, which was surprisingly very delicious. Although it was a bit too runny, they used a darker cocoa which had a very rich and deep flavour. I wish that part was also all you can eat!!   In summary, my party of 4 has decided that we won't be coming back. It was a cool experience and this restaurant has definitely created a very intriguing new take on hot pot but at that price point serving mediocre food - we'll pass."}
{"text":"The restaurant was cute and the soup base I had was pretty unique and good (soy soup base). But I found the foods that they had were very average and the soy sauce at the dipping sauce station was often empty. Overall, I'd say it's good to try once or twice, but not necessarily a place I'd go back again and again."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is probably like a hot pot version of the Dazzling cafe with very cute blue decor instead of pink. Located in the New Kennedy Square plaza, there is plenty of parking if you come during dinner time. This place has opened for 3 months and not many people are aware, so I thought I'd take my two friends here on a very cold Saturday evening. With few very mixed reviews on Yelp, I decided to give it a try. I had made a reservation for 6:30pm and walked in to a few tables of people already eating. The place eventually got busy after 7pm. The environment was very clean and brightly lit. There were two party rooms on the left hand side when you walk in through the doors facing the reception area perfect for larger parties for privacy. On the right hand side was the main dining hall with a few tables on the ground floor and more seating on the elevated platform. There were a good mix of sofa seats and free standing tables. The theme of the restaurant gave me sailor vibes because of the blue and white contrast in the paint colours and furniture, but the chandeliers gave off a little more elegant feel.   In terms of pricing, this place is cheaper than Xiangzi Hot Pot with some similarities and differences. It is AYCE with the food brought to you. At Xiangzi, you get your own food at the buffet tables. The only thing you need to get on your own here, is your condiments and sauces next to the reception area. The menu was written all in Chinese, so thank goodness my friends knew how to read it. To make it more customer friendly, I'd suggest maybe putting out English menus or you'll be limiting the number of people who can dine here. Like Xiangzi, each person pays a fixed price depending on the day of the week or holidays, and then you pick your soup base which is an additional charge. The individual pots were protected with a very pretty exterior rim that prevents you from getting burned from the hot surface. A very thoughtful touch I'd say. The service was great, the servers were very well mannered and always made sure our pots were filled with broth.   The menu is made up of several categories of raw foods to choose from such as: veggies, meats, handmade meat balls, seafood, etc. A very interesting fact about this restaurant is that they serve the raw meats on the tall trays used for high tea / afternoon tea. You'll know what I mean when you see my photos. I guess it saves room on the table and looks a little more aesthetically pleasing. I must say though I was fairly impressed with the quality of beef they served. Although frozen like many hot pot places, it was still very fresh in terms of colour and marbling so we helped ourselves to a few plates of that. The soup base that I had selected was very enjoyable as well. It was well flavoured and not very oily all the way until the end of the meal. Overall, I had a great dining experience with my friends and will be back :)"}
{"text":"This would have been a 3 star review had it not been for the ridiculous service we got from an incompetent waiter  I went with my friends, we were a group of 6 and we called ahead on a Saturday and they told us they didn't have 6 tables left and said we could have 2 4 seaters next to each. ok that's fine.  We didn't all arrive at the same time so we just kinda sat there looking at the (Chinese Only) menu and grabbed our sauces/desserts. Since only one of us knew how to read Chinese she was busy telling us what soup bases they had right in the middle of her talking a waiter interrupted and asked for our order in Mandarin. We tried to tell him we weren't ready yet. HIS DAMN REPLY WAS \"WHAT?!\"-firstly it was his attitude that was a complete turn-off. He said it in a tone of \"what do you mean you are not ready?!\" then he kept speaking in Mandarin (which only one of us speaks) and she had to tell him to give us a second. When he did come back to take our order when we were ready he was completely incompetent. Since half of us didn't speak Mando half of us were already POINTING to the soup base on the menu and he was still struggling. It got to the point where one waiter stepped in and said he'll do it. Jaden our new waiter appears to be the only one who speaks English there and acts like he actually cares about his job. What I don't understand is why didn't the other waiter just ask Jaden to help in the first place?! Instead, he kept standing there with an attitude and rolling his eyes at us like WTF. Oh they do have an English Menu which was not supplied to us until afterwards -.-\" The Chinese menu is nicely priced on a trifold and bound with leather. But the English one was a 3 page  Word doc printed and stapled together...  The only saving grace of this experience was Jaden. I could tell half my table was ready to rage after dealing with the other waiter.   The decor is cute but kinda odd. It looks like a English High Tea place but hot pot. You get an individual pot with a cute decorative covering around the pot.   Price is 24.99 for adults weekdays then weekend and holidays is +$2. Soup bases range from $3-$10. The food is mediocre, typically hot pot offerings. There were 3 types of desserts that you can grab for yourself next to the sauces. But by the time we were done our dinner, there was only one dessert left.    TL:DR: The only server who knows how to do his job is Jaden. The other guys are useless. Food is okay, fancy decor."}
{"text":"Quiet hot pot place with a confusing design. The interior and everything of the meal is designed as if you are at a cafe for high tea, yet I can't imagine hot pot ever being exquisite, it just doesn't mix.  That being said, their beef and fish are really fresh, but if you don't eat either and/or lamb, you don't have much choice of anything else. For an all you can eat hot pot joint, there's not a lot to offer.   The soup bases are quite flavourful, but they do range from $3 to $10 and you have to get one. I ordered the mushroom and it was flavourful with earthy tones and a variety of mushrooms giving it texture.   Not sure if I would come back per se, but the place is rather unknown to people and so if you want a quieter place for hot pot and don't mind your typical toppings of beef, fish, balls, choi, and lamb, then go for it!"}
{"text":"Came here with my parents on a Monday evening around 7pm. The first thing that caught my attention was the huge teddy bear at the reception, looks cute and cuddly.  We were welcomed by a young guy and took us to a table. We were seated at the lower level of the restaurant, you can take a few steps of stairs and get more tables, but I didn't go there so I don't know how big the restaurant actually is. On the level that we were, there are about 5 or 6 tables of 4 people, and half of them were occupied.   I ordered the tomato ox-tail soup, my parents ordered the Miso soup and Fish soup and we all loved it. Mine had actual tomato pieces and 2 generous pieces of ox-tail. The soup was salty enough and I didn't need to dip in salty sauces (soy).  I like how we can easily change the temperature of the hot plates to our own liking and I love the table setting, it helps save space on the table. The waiters were patient with us as we were ordering while looking at the menu. They came twice to refill the soup, not with the soup that you actually ordered but with a plain broth. I don't know if soft drinks are free, but the young guy who greeted us came and gave us 3 cans of soft drinks for free. Most of the foods that we ordered came in a quite small portion except the beef and lamb slices came in a full plate each.   It was a really good experience for me and my parents. The only reason why I'm putting 4 stars instead of 5 is the price and their lack of desserts. They only have chocolate fondue, which they give 1 marshmallow, 1-2 grapes and 1 slice of banana per person (it's not AYCE). Weekdays adult prices are $24.99 (+$2 for weekends) + you have to add your soup base which ranges from $3-$9 I believe. Minimum $27.99 an adult for an AYCE hot pot, I'd rather go to an AYCE for same price which offers different cuisines altogether (chinese, japanese, thai).  Food: 4/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 4.5/5 Cleanliness: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"My husband and I went Monday night after the huge snowstorm hence we were one of 4 tables in the restaurant.  The service was good which I'd expect with just 4 tables to serve. However, i did notice some of the servers with their heads down on the phones instead of paying attention to the customers. Their ordering system is on an iPad which the server uses as you rhyme off all the different items that you want. There was a good variety of dishes to choose from, the portions they bring out are just right and a selection of spicy and non spicy soup bases. They had an a la cart menu for higher quality beef but we opted not to pay extra for it. Their standard meat was still soft and flavourful. For 2 people they did give us a lot of meat. They also made grilled skewers which were tasty and if you order a lot of them they would light up the stone grill at your table to keep them warm.  The only thing wouldn't recommend is the Handmade Lamb Cake Mix.  It had a weird taste and a super chalky texture which was not pleasant at all. The Handmade Shrimp Cake mix was acceptable but not something we'd care to order again.  Dessert was a chocolate fondu which was a nice touch but again, nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"I came here last week with my boyfriend just around dinner time. It had really nice design concept, the staff were extremely welcoming and very nice. The soup selection was not bad. Tom yum was pretty much on par as what it should taste like. I am a hotpot queen lover and sometimes when ordering TomYum it can be very sweet- not my liking. The rib eye beef was excellent in terms of the quality. Its a nice experience to go, however if they offer more selection of sides definitely will consider. They don't have a drink menu as well as they are still new. Would recommend adding watermelon juice options or other fun juices. Overall staff were amazing!"}
{"text":"First Impressions ============= Cute!  And up-scale type of feel.  Friendly staff greeted us.  Not your typical hot pot decoration, it's pretty classy~  The place looks pretty clean as well but it is also quite new.  Food ===== SOUPS: delicious.  MEATS: All their meat items were delicious and seemed fresh.  Make sure you try the marinated meats as well!  The Angus Ribeye was good Ribeye.  The quality of meat did not decrease as we ordered more (like some ayce hot pot restaurants)  SEAFOOD: selection was not a lot but enough for me.  We ordered mussels, shrimps and they were good.  VEGE: They have a large vege selection.  We tried watercress, lettuce, lotus roots, all were cleaned, and seemed fresh!   Would I come back? =============== Yes yes yes!! Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Me and my brother went for their opening BOGO event and we were there around 4:30 pm(they started at (5pm). We didn't eat for the first round, instead we waited for the second round (at like 8:00pm).  The food was good except they ran out of the  Japanese soymilk soup base. We had the curry and the mushroom soup base. The curry soup base is a bit too strong that you cannot even taste the food itself. The mushroom soup goes go with the food.   They also have different kinds of skewers which are very delicious and worth trying. The server were nice and not pushing their customers to leave after 1.5hour.   Overall, 4stars, it's a nice hotpot place to try."}
{"text":"I'll give this place a 4 star. I generally don't have high expectations with hot pot places 'cause I think most places are generally the same.   I called them this morning wanting to confirm with them about their birthday promo as they just introduced it yesterday on their Instagram. One person is free when accompanied with three other people and 15% off your bill for the entire month.   Unfortunately when I called them this morning, the guy who picked up the phone had no idea what I was talking about and said he would ask his boss and then call me back. Already I was disappointed with this place. Two hours later I haven't heard back from him so I called again and he said he'll call his boss right away and give me a call back. Ugh. 10 mins later he called back confirming the birthday promo and when I asked about the 15% off, he stuttered for awhile and then said that it'll apply. Yay.  I arrived just before 6:30 and was surprised to find that my family and I were the first in the restaurant on a Friday night. Not sure if it's too early for some people to eat or it was the weather but it made me hesitant cause I wasn't sure if the place was bad or not lol.   The food came out quickly and service was attention seeing that we were the only one there. Halfway through our meal the place started to fill up. I personally thought the skewers were a nice touch to the hot pot and you can actually drink the soup unlike other places. We ordered the mushroom soup base, black chicken with flower soup base, and Korean kimchi soup base (best of the three in my opinion). My absolute favourite part of dinner was the AYCE TAKOYAKI!!! Btw, on the skewers menu it says Japanese Sweet Rice Ball, but it's actually salty. The rest of the food was fresh and the portions for the meat (beef, pork, lamb) were quite big.  For dessert, they have fondue.   When asking for the bill, first they charged us all original pricing without the promo, so then I had to explain to them that I was the one calling them earlier. So then they changed it and stupid me didn't check the bill, and I realized that we didn't get the 15% off. Kinda disappointed.   Would I come back? Probably."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend who had heard quite a bit of hype about it so we decided to check it out. Thinking it might be super busy on a Saturday night, we decided to go early to avoid a line. When we arrived, there was only one other table occupied. Actually, over the course of the evening, it never did quite fill up.   The room is very bright and unique in the decor - white and blue walls with chandeliers hanging from mirrors in the ceiling. Totally reminded me of going for high tea with my girlfriends.   For our meal, we both chose the mushroom broth and went about selecting our items. I've only got one other place to compare to for hot pot, but I felt the portions of meat were quite large. We had ribeye and lamb, followed by a big selection of vegetables and seafood. We also had some satays, which I found extremely disappointing. They were just dried out bits of meat on skewers, \"heated\" over a tea light. I suggest you avoid them as they were really bad.   The veggies were good but I thought the portions were kind of confusing. Sometimes it would be a big pile of something (spinach) and others would be just a few pieces. Perhaps that's my inexperience showing, I don't know. I like when things are consistent, so I know how much to order.   The sauce bar was interesting, and I appreciated that part of it. You can mix and mingle to your liking, which I assume results in less waste.   We also had some fresh pear juice, which I quite enjoyed. A pitcher shared between two people is a good deal, as it gives you about two full glasses. A bit 'pulpy' but nice and refreshing. The chocolate fondue for dessert was a bit gimmicky and I personally did not enjoy the taste, but my friend thought it was decent.   Overall, I'd say it was an enjoyable meal but aside from the decor, nothing really special."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends for hot pot and although it was just the 7 of us, we were fortunate to get the VIP room. The staff were all very friendly and attended to our orders very quickly. The decor was very nice, bright and well lit. The price per person is also very reasonable. Will definitely come back again with a even larger crowd."}
{"text":"TLDR:  Overall rating is a solid 3.5 stars.  We came in a slow evening, so we didn't wait for a table or experience slow services like some previous reviewers.  This review, hence, focuses on the food and the ambiance.  The unique and glamourous ambiance hit me in the face upon entrance.  The whole place is decorated like an European high tea place.  There are blue walls, white furniture and chandeliers.  Some food plates are placed on a stand that is usually used to hold tea biscuits and cakes.  Servers wear uniforms.  They line up along a wall when waiting for requests from customers.  I like the decoration, but the servers lining up waiting seems cheesy to me.    The meat and vegetables are all you can eat.  The variety are pretty good.  We ordered too many things to list (or remember).  All items were delivered to table promptly.  I found everything we ordered was fresh.  I seriously didn't find anything stale.  For a hot pot place, this was a must and most important.  My favorite meat was the ox tongue.  I know ox tongue might sound weird, but do order it to try.  I mixed my dipping sauce at a separate table.  With all the extravagances, I find the off side, self-serve mixing table out of place.  You should allot a few bucks on top of the list price, as the broth costs extra, and ordering plain water is not an option.  I had the spicy Tom Yum broth, and it was indeed spicy.  As Little Sheep Hot Pot allows customers to order a pot of plain water to avoid the broth fee, and J'adore doesn't, I take 1/2 star off the rating, thus the 3.5 stars rating."}
{"text":"This will be the classiest all you can eat hot pot experience that you're going to get.  I loved the dreamy blue interior ambiance setting at J'Adore accompanied with their High Tea style platings. Presentation is definitely on point here that's for sure!   There are 3 exclusive soup bases available including the Japanese Miso Soup, Japanese soymilk soup and Korean Kimchi. In addition, they also serve chocolate fondue for dessert! Lastly, don't forget to order their BBQ skewers. My favourite was their cheesy pork skewers.  Hot pot dish wise, you must try the house special shrimp paste. It was very soft and chewy.  I also think the price is more than reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that you will be getting.  I mean...all you can eat hot pot, skewers, and fondue for dessert?! That's unheard of.  Weekday Prices: $25.00 (adult) $12.95 (age 3-14), $18.95 (seniors) $2 extra on weekends. Go hungry friends. ."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and overrated. The soup base was salty with lots of MSG. The beef was very tough. The \"fresh\" shrimp paste was frozen solid. The place isn't fancy enough for me to pay this price n have such quality of food to be honest. I don't think I will recommend any of my friends to go.  The two stars are for: 1. Friendly and attentive staff. 2. Chocolate fondue was the best part of the entire meal. What can possibly go wrong with dipping banana n marshmallows into chocolate."}
{"text":"This place was all over social media. So lets give it a try. Hot pot was never something fancy, just a pot of boiling broth, everything stick their chopsticks in and cook whatever you desire. The idea of individual pots has been around for a while. But this place definitely brought it to a whole new level. Cute decor, blue themed, afternoon tea racks. Everything was so fancy. They also offer some unique flavour for broth. Everything was fresh, no complains. Service was okay, servers not fluent in english. Best with mandarin and some canto. Had an opening promotion going on for 20% off. It came to $35 per person all you can eat. Would i visit again? Not on a regular.   What I ordered: House special tofu broth Miso broth  Tomato ox tail broth Pear juice Various items on the all you can eat menu Various skewer items"}
{"text":"Food - Food was just alright. Nothing outstanding. The meat slices could be a little thinner, but it had a good selection. From seafood, to lamb, and beef and everything hot-pot like. Each person gets their own individual hotpot, which is great. I ordered the J'adore beef spicy soup base, and it was great :) I would come back if it were craving hot pot if I were in the area, but to be honest, I have had better. Their selection is good!   Service - A little on the slow side. Could benefit from having paper to fill out instead of going down the menu every time to order. We were here til about 30 minutes to close, and was told last call was almost an hour before close. We kind of felt rushed.   Atmosphere - Aesthetics is probably what would hype this place up. It looks like a high tea place. As soon as you enter the hot pot joint, you're greeted with a big hugging teddy bear, and bold blue walls with white outlines. It's adorable. Their plates are stacked in a high-tea fashion, stacked upwards. They do earn presentation points, as you can definitely see the hard work and effort put into the aesthetics. Even the pots around the individual hot-pot are cute and colourful.   Recommend this place if you are craving hot-pot but overall alright. I think it's been hyped up on various websites for the grand opening. Would probably try it out a second time."}
{"text":"This all you can eat hot pot place is way over price. $24.99 for weekday. $26.99 for weekend & holiday. And you gotta pay extra for the soup base which is starting from $4 (mix mushroom soup). So technically you are paying for at least $28.99 plus tax & tips on the weekday.  I went there yesterday on Halloween Day. They gotta charge us extra $2 for \"Holiday/weekend\" price. We were like WTF. And the place is quiet as hell. Anyways, since we are there, let's give it a shot to see if any good. Nope, nothing is good.  So don't waste your money."}
{"text":"After my friends and I ate here, all of us when back with diarrhea...  When we first entered the restaurant, it was absolutely beautiful. The staff were nice and friendly as well. We came in the afternoon so we were the only group at the place.  I got the tomato soup base, and everyone else got their house special. They have a nice variety of choices of food, but nothing very special.  The price per person was around $40 including the soup base (which I don't understand), but in the end, they had this cute little dipping desert where you dip the marshmallows/ banana into the chocolate. The chocolate was not hot and it wasn't the best fondue I had, but it was the only desert they carried ;( I do not think I will be ever coming here again after what happened. Not clean..."}
