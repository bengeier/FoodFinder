{"text":"My friend introduced me to this restaurant a while ago and I've never looked back.  They have 3 different soups daily.  Meat, vegetarian and a vegan option so it's perfect for everyone.  The soups are so fresh and tasty and since they are different every day you can never get tired of going back.  The restaurant is really small so your best option is to grab a cup and enjoy it somewhere else.  They also have sandwiches and salads but I've only had the soup.   Try this place out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's too bad, but this joint has closed. It probably will be replaced by another bar masquerading as a restaurant."}
{"text":"Le Bar A Soupe is a great little soup joint on Ossington. They have three different soups every day of the week (a meat, veggie and vegan option) and their menu changes each month. The service is super friendly and the soup is delicious! They also serve sandwiches, salads and sweets.  The place is pretty small and there is limited seating so it might be better to bring your own thermos (yes, they fill up home brought containers) and head over to Trinity Bellwoods for a summer lunch in the park.  The only issue I have with the place is that they use styrofoam bowls and plastic spoons when you dine in. Regardless of that, the variety, price and tastiness will definitely draw me back for more but I'll probably start bringing my own container. I also can't wait to go here in the winter/late fall. Soup in the winter is the best."}
