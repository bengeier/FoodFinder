{"text":"Delightful!  Delectable food, good wine, very friendly waitstaff.  We had the pear salad, escargot and chicken in a chili sauce.  Everything was great including the fresh hot bread served to us with a tapenade and butter!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome - it's just down the street from me and I am SO thankful for it. Since moving to Beaconsfield, the restaurant choices nearby have been limited/very disappointing. Plus, the rest of the West Island kind of sucks. But this place is excellent. I'd also say it's fairly priced.   The restaurant is located in a converted home, making it very cozy. The staff are so warm and friendly, and it's clear that the restaurant is family-owned and that the owners actually care about their customers. Despite its location, this place could compete with what you find in the city, no problem. It is also consistently excellent. I would definitely recommend that you check out this gem!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice for different occasions   Both times were fantastic. Wait staff is friendly and very attentive. Food is excellent. I had the appetizer of goat cheese with balsamic reduction and it was amazing.   Everyone at my table on both occasions were very satisfied with the food. Good wine, great food and excellent service. I don't need more than that. Owner comes to the table to ensure we are happy. Nice touch! Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Was nervous at first bc the place was small and empty (came on a Friday night at 630), but the staff was beyond courteous (Karine was our waitress), had great drinks (including flights of whiskey), and the food was awesome. Highly recommended."}
