{"text":"They were very disorganized and don't seem to know what's going on. We went a few days after opening and it was a bad experience.  Dishes were dirty.  I don't mean there was a piece of food stuck to the plate, I mean that the entire plate was covered in brown oil spots.  This means that they didn't even put in new cooking oil before they opened. Or apparently bothered to wash the dishes.  Food was lukewarm, not hot.  How does soup come out warmish in a Chinese restaurant??  Food was very oily and given the condition of the oil on the plates, I didn't really eat much of it.    I gave 2 stars bc the servers seemed genuinely embarrassed by the situation and did try their best to ratify their mistakes."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. This restaurant changed their Chinese name to ??????. English registered name is still the same as previous, I guess they weren't doing too well before.  Service was great. The lady server always says thank you, no matter what the situation is - whether she is bringing out our dishes, refilling our tea pot or giving us extra napkins *thumbs up*  Presentation of dishes were on humongous plates! Our table can sit 6 people, three dishes already covered the center of table lol. Nevertheless, dishes still look pleasant to the eye.  Our adventure tonight was quite a roller coaster ride. It started off pretty rocky in the beginning with a rather diluted complementary soup. The meat for the standard chicken dish was a bit too soft for my liking. Pork and veggies dish was standard. Love that they have a large variety of veggies. They finally redeemed themselves with their honey and garlic ribs - they were very tasty! But by dessert time, it went down hill with an extremely watery purple rice soup with barely any purple rice, so it was just purple rice water lol. I am glad that was complementary too.   It was rather expensive for the 3 dishes we ordered (it was over $50 with tips even with 15% discount) Will I come back? Possibly. Still want to try their seafood. But my mom swears that she will not come again lol."}
{"text":"1.5 star  No dim sum? Seriously? The ad in the newspaper for Fu Kou Le scream dim sum special till 4 pm.   Lunch Special items for congee, noodle and rice.   New and really unorganized. Got our order wrong and asked if we want to just take the wrong item instead?  Lobster Congee ($10.99) and Homestyle fried noodles ($6.50) both sub par.  Congee was really watery with no flavour and where's the ginger? Noodle with zero fresh off the wok flavour?  I doubt I will be back for dinner...."}
