{"text":"We came here for a Sunday dinner, and as it was the week-end, a wait was expected.  The line actually moved fairly quickly, so it wasn't too bad. After being seated, our waitress came, and she was quite friendly.  It took about 30 minutes before we got our food - longer wait than we expected. It seemed there was a hold-up of some sort in the kitchen though because once the food started coming out, a lot of food was coming out. We had onion rings for appetizer, and it was delicious. The batter was light and crispy, and the sauces were very good.   My husband had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, medium rare, and he really enjoyed it.  I was a bit boring and got the ultimate cheeseburger, medium well (since I'm pregnant and shouldn't eat anything too rare). The waitress asked if I wanted any toppings for my burger, and among other things, I requested extra pickles on my burger. When the burgers came out, it was obvious to me that the waitress wrote down that I asked for \"extra\" pickles because my burger was loaded with pickles - a good sign that she listened, and the chefs made the food as ordered. While I wished I would have ordered my burger medium, it was still quite good. The cheese flavor was quite strong, but overall, a very good burger.  Perhaps it's because I'm pregnant, but the sweet pickles were delicious - I had to ask for an extra side of pickles and actually finished all of that too. The burger was quite large for me, and after eating half of the burger, I took the buns off the other half so I can finish my dinner without overstuffing myself.  Overall, great place.  If I'm in the area, I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Let's just say to start that I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay. This restaurant however, shows some serious irony as to how he shows himself on television when it comes to running a kitchen.   To start we had the kettle chip nachos. These had a nice flavor and the meat was tender.   We ordered the Hog Burger and the Ultimate Cheeseburger with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries. We ordered the ultimate cheeseburger medium rare and the hog burger well. We were told that the burgers take at least twenty minutes to come out since they are made fresh to order. We had no problem with the wait.   The burgers arrived.... the ultimate cheeseburger was cooked perfect and had great seasoning and flavor in the first bite... the next bite and the rest ended up tasteless and boring. The cheese even lacked flavor.   The hog burger, that was just under cooked. When getting to the middle of the burger the pork was cold, mushy and well... was just raw.   When we brought it to the attention of the waitress, now this is where it gets good, her response was, \"Well that is the type of pork it is.\" We showed her that the middle was cold and raw and she continued by saying, \"The chef says that it is the type of burger that no matter how long you cook it the meat stays red and that the center doesn't cook all the way, that it is the way it should be.\" I tried not to laugh. Kitchen Nightmares flashed in my head and I could picture Gordon Ramsay saying,\"You bloody idiot\".   The sad part is this restaurant bares the name of Gordon Ramsay a man who prides himself on how food is prepared and consistency of what comes out of his kitchens. I am just hoping that serving raw pork is not what his chefs think is best for his customers.   In this case they should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this restaurant as a coworker said it was the best food she had ever had.  We got in line (Thursday night) and after 10 minutes of the line not moving an employee walked down the line to verify everyone in line was group's of 2 or less - asked for an ETA and was told 10-15 minutes.  Shy of 30 minutes later we were seated - it was very nice, but loud, in the restaurant.  Menus were waiting, and within 5 minutes we had water and placed our orders (Tandoori Chicken and the Hells kitchen burger, plus an order of the parmesan fries).  We were told the wait for food would be 25-30 minutes.  The burgers were good, not that much better than a Red Robin burger.  Fries were amazing.  The service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Amazing burger, got there 10 mins before opening on a Sunday, waited a few mins.  Ate the recommended Anniversary burger without sides or appetizers, it was so good.  The price was $22, but compare to other places, it was worth it."}
{"text":"Did come here to see how the chefs from Gordon Ramsay team would prepare the burgers and other items. Would say a complete let down.   I had some uninvited guests in the form of stone/broken chicken bone spec. When asked about it to the waiter he was kind enough to send his manager to speak to us and imagine what, I was told that these kind of things can be possible and sounded so obvious.  My question would be, who would have been responsible if I broke my tooth trying to chew that bone? Gordon Ramsay or his manager?   Before I was assigned my table, I saw almost all tables having fries so I thought it might be the best item in the menu. I think it should have been named as wedges instead of fries. Moreover when they were served they were not served hot. Not sure when they were prepared.                                                  Not quite a standard when you are selling stuff with GR tag to it."}
{"text":"I binge watched kitchen nightmares for hours last year, this restaurant lives up to my standards and then some. Long wait, pricey food, but amazing food and huge burger. Very fancy Parmesan fries, a must buy. Servers are extremely nice, the menu is pretty good. The highlight was definitely the meat and cheese. The mozarella tasted like heaven and made me regret not getting a double cheese burger. I even got a hat.....I don't know why...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a late lunch so we only waited 20 minutes for a table. The service was okay, and the food was decent but it definitely is not worth waiting for 1 hour+. The prices are reasonably priced but it's not worth the hype. We probably wouldn't come back next time."}
{"text":"Ordered the F@&K burger, because it's a limited special and I know I won't be back to Vegas for quite awhile. It had a great flavor, and the meat, which I could taste the higher quality being aged, was cook exactly as I asked. My party of six was extremely satisfied. One of whom refused to finish his burger because he said \"I do t want it to end\". Top notch burgers!"}
{"text":"Overrated. I had the truffles fries and the shrimp curried salad, neither was good. The fries tasted old. The shrimp with the salad was cold when served.   The wait to a table was one hour and the wait for food was another hour (even though the waiter told us 30 min)."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth it. I got the portobello mushroom burger and it was delicious. Best one i've ever had. I'm assuming wait can get long though, so prepare for that. We came on a monday at around 1pm and waited about 45 minutes from waiting to get a table to actually getting the food. Not too bad for vegas at lunch time."}
{"text":"The burgers were good but I have had better. The fries were stale and weren't as good as we were told. The service was decent, but we received our burgers and then our fries about 5 minutes later. I really believe the rave about this place is just because of Gordon Ramsey's popular name and because it's in The Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Hell's Kitchen show, so I wanted to eat at one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants on our vacation to Las Vegas.  Sadly, this one was a bit of a let down.  I naturally ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger which was pretty good, but I felt that I could get better burger flavor from Red Robin.  My wife ordered a set of chicken prosciutto sliders which were, admittedly, awful (over cooked).  I really wanted to leave this place a five star review because of my liking for Hell's Kitchen but three is all I can manage."}
{"text":"The food was simply amazing. I ordered the crown burger, truffle fries, and a shake (must be the kid in me). The food was exactly what I expected from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The food had big bold flavors with seasoned burgers and fries. The staff was extremely knowledgeable about their menu and service was perfect. We waited about 25 minutes for our food but it was well worth the wait. Thank for an excellent meal and great final experience as we get ready to leave Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger out there. It must be something with the meat they use I don't know. I come here every time I go to Vegas usually two times per visit. Get the Euro burger. I fucks with it. Also all of there fry options are amazing."}
{"text":"Long wait times to get in, although food was flavorful and delicious. Wine choices and dessert choices were stellar. Honestly saw wear and tear on the bar stools though. The truffle fries were not \"snappy\" like French fries should be... they weirdly had a stale like consistency. The Hog burger was great, but destroyed my intestines that night. I don't know what ingredient did it; but I'd love to know so I could do an \"elimination diet\" experiment with the ingredients. Overall, I'd give it four to five stars if it wasn't for loud atmosphere and wear in the restaurant."}
{"text":"What has happened to my favorite burger stop in Las Vegas.  First the jalape√±o poppers are off the menu... something I always ordered when I came.  But it took over 60 minutes for them to deliver a medium well burger.  First it was well done, then it was medium well.  They said they would take care of the cost because of the issue in the kitchen.  But starving at the table for an hour is just unacceptable.  Just disappointed in an otherwise great establishment.  I did like the fact I saw a portobello mushroom burger on the menu.  Might try that, if I ever come back.  For now.. I ill try something else"}
{"text":"Tried this place because we'll they have a celebrity chef owner and would like to see why so many people are waiting for a hamburger.  Well to start off her the chef recommendation. It's huge and worth it.  The other burger in the menu are smaller than the chef recommendation but it's cheaper.  Fries are good size and looks fresh.  Server is friendly and attentive.  I'm surprised how smiling they are even though the place are packed."}
{"text":"Still the best burger I've ever had. These guys don't F'around. Had the sirloin burger with parmesan sprinkled fries but that burger stole the show. I've been here several times and it never disappoints. They have some really good tasting strong beer as well."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay Burger has a permanent spot on our things to do list when we come to Vegas. This was our third time eating GRB and I must say superb. The burgers are so good you over look the wait, about 25 minutes or so. I would definitely recommend GRB to everyone but keep in mind the burgers aren't cheep."}
{"text":"I had the backyard burger it was really good and the fries are big enough to share for two our wait time was about 20 minutes ."}
{"text":"Amazing burger. It is well worth the wait. You can have anything from a traditional burger to a crazy concoction. A must have while in Vegas. I suggest making a dinner reservation at 4. There will still be a wait, but something that is \"reasonable.\" The service is very good. Definitely what I would expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant."}
{"text":"1. The food was SO salty. There is no way Gordon Ramsey would approve.  We ordered Bluecheese Burger, Crown Burger and Truffle Fries. I asked for a well-done patty, not a jerkey. It was so dry and salty.    2. We had to wait 30 minutes after ordering to get the burgers and the fry. The fry was on the shelf in the kitchen for about good 15 minutes before we got them.  (Because it was an open kitchen, we were able to watch our fry getting dry.) Thanks to the long waiting time, the fry's texture was like a baguette.   3. It took 10 more minutes to get the bill.   4. The server looked really angry. She looked like Gordon Ramsey when he's pissed off."}
{"text":"Not worth it. Although I did not have a burger, I ate with a group of 7 and all of them had a burger. One loved the burger, the others just thought it was mediocre. One person asked for a well done burger and they gave it to him medium rare. My other friend asked for her burger to be cut after it was already out and presented and the guy who delivered the food said sorry but he could not cut the burger in half because the chefs are \"you know\" and it would ruin the presentation, there were also no knives provided that were good enough to cut the burger. I ordered the ahi tuna sliders and they stuffed the slider too much to eat with my hands. I had to use a fork and it ruined the experience of what a slider is supposed to be. On top of that, they tasted like nothing. The bun was my favourite part of the dish. I will say, our server was excellent. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The selection of beers and craft cocktails at Burger is awesome. I ordered the Farmhouse 14 Burger, which was incredible. I had prepared medium rare, and it was loaded with dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon and a fried egg. Yummy!!!  Highly recommend the food and beers.  Unfortunately, I had to give Gordon Ramsay Burger only 1 star due to the service. It was not good, specifically one person. The actual service was good once a tall bartender named Michelle helped my girlfriend and me. The other bartender named Petey was solid, too.  Eric was a total jerk. He was very condescending and rude. It seemed as if he was unhappy to be at work and it was an inconvenience to serve my us. He was making rude comments about a prior customer to us. Uhhh, it was tacky.  Topping it off, Eric was extremely disrespectful and sexist to the girl bartender. The constant barrage of talking down towards the girl bartender was such a turn off. My girlfriend and I decided to leave after paying our bill, heading over to Heart Bar for drinks instead.  If Eric had a better attitude towards us and his co-workers, we would have stayed. Hopefully this was just a circumstance on which he was having a bad day. It still doesn't excuse the chauvinistic and disrespectful attitude directed at women our entire meal.  I will definitely be back for the food and beers, but not if Eric is working. Well, I could handle it, but no chance my girlfriend would want to be served by him ever again. Glad there were other bartenders available to help out and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Definitely a great burger experience. I got the farmhouse burger, and my wife guy the forest. We shared fries. The beer selection is good with many choices from IPAs to lagers, and our server, Alex, was a pro.   The burger. I don't know how to explain the bun, but it was awesome. It was light, but kept all the burger ingredients in place. The egg on mine was cooked perfectly, and the beef was seasoned nicely. I didn't think I could eat the whole thing, but I did. Perfection on a bun.   The fries came with two dipping sauces, ketchup and a house made aoli with black truffles and garlic. Super delicious.   We waited in line for about 15 minutes, but the food was served fast after we ordered. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on Thursday around 5:15pm. After a very small wait in a very busy restaurant, we got seated and placed our food order around 5:21. Our server was very prompt and got us our drinks (he got a beer and I got the jalape√±o 'rita) right away and we got our onion ring appetizer within 5 minutes.  Our burgers and fries arrived at 5:36.   The burger was cooked beautifully and was very tasty, but not nearly as spicy as we were hoping (Hells' Kitchen burger). We love spice and were just a little let down about that, but the overall flavor of the burger was very good. We got one order of fries to split and that was enough for both of us, and they were cooked well.   I decided I couldn't leave without trying a creme br√ªl√©e milkshake, and I was not disappointed with the Oreo one. It was delicious and generous enough to share if you feel like it.   I mention the times we arrived and were served because this was the FASTEST food we had gotten anywhere in Vegas during our entire stay there, and the food was delicious.  When I saw how packed the place was, I was expecting a long wait for food and was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the burgers (although the people I was with did like them). I'm allergic to sesame so I figured I'd get the hot dog. I love hot dogs and I knew the burgers had sesame on the buns. However, apparently the hot dog buns did too! (I've never seen a hot dog bun with a sesame seeds). They were very understanding and took the hot dog back; however, they didn't have a seedless hot dog bun option. My two options were either the hot dog wrapped in a flatbread or in lettuce. I chose flatbread. By the time I got my hot dog, though, everyone else had finished eating, and the hot dog was just a normal hot dog. The staff was friendly though, and everyone else seemed to enjoy the burgers. I would just suggest not going there if you have a sesame allergy."}
{"text":"The hamburger was one of the most flavorful and juicy burgers I've ever had! Didn't even need any mayonnaise or ketchup! The fries were ok, told my hubby the fries were like a Prius compared to the burger which was like a Cadillac. But wouldn't deter me from going back. Everyone was so tentative, and our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. All around great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing got the F burger you have to ask for it, it's not on the menu   Get the Hell's Kitchen!!!  If you have a hard time to figure out what to get just ask them it's pretty good all around"}
{"text":"(A little later review on this one....)  While I had high hopes for this place, I got to say, I was really disappointed.   I strolled up on a Friday afternoon, a little after 12:45pm  to place a take out order, as I was staying at PH and just wanted to grab something and take it up to my room.    The girls up front were friendly and eager to help, but seemed to be having a problem with swiping their cards and being able to log in to take my order.   They went back and forth between 2 different machines and called over like 3 different people to try.   Eventually they got it figured out and took my order.   I ordered onion rings, (asked for an extra cheddar ranch) and a burger cooked medium rare.   She repeated my order, but neglected my request for an extra ranch, so I kindly asked if she got the extra ranch part.   She said \"Oh yah, don't worry\"  MMMMMMoK.  So I pay for my order and she tells me it'll be 30 minutes.   I was a little surprised, but was fine with that, hoping that since it was just a single burger and a side that it may come closer to the 20 minute mark.    It's now a few minutes before 1:00pm.    I go off and gamble in the casino a bit and come back at 1:30 thinking that the order should be ready.   I go back to the counter and ask the girl if my order was ready.    She tells me to wait on the side and she'll go check.   She goes off in the back and comes back a minute later and is just having a good time with her friends up there.   She's helping other customers and then talking story again with her co-workers, having a great time.   All the while, I'm just standing there.  5 more minutes go by and I go back up there and kindly ask if she found out if my order was ready because she clearly had no intention of letting me know what's going on.   She tells me \"oh yah, they're checking on it\".   Oooooooooook, well you could've at least told me something.    Another 5 minutes go by and now I'm just starving already.   Finally after 50 MINUTES, the girl comes up with my food like nothing ever happened.   She tells me thank you and is about to walk away.   I ask her is the extra cheddar ranch in there? and she tells me \"Oh, did you want an extra one?\"   Uhhhhhh yes please, I already had to ask for it twice when ordering, why not one more time right?    I mean is that a difficult request to get correct?    She gladly gets it for me and I'm on my way back up to grind!    I'm all excited when I get back to my room thinking this meal is going to be hot and delicious......NOT!    No joke guys/gals, the burger and onion rings were not even warm.   Seriously, not even warm at all!   Oh and my burger was almost cooked well done.   On the flip side, Gordon's onion rings are BOMB (even when cold)!    The burger though was super disappointing.    Obviously because it was room temperature and over cooked, but it was also under-seasoned too.   Sooooooo disappointing.     I thought about calling down and letting a manager know about it, but was just over it already.  We went through our apps, sides, and steaks in less than 50 minutes at Gordon Ramsay Steak earlier in the week, and it was amazing.   The Burger joint.......not so much.   So many better options in Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here and tries Hell's Kitchen Burger.  Best burger I have had in quite some time!!!  Top it with onion rings and a Guinness!!!  Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best burger, ask for the f burger ia not in the menu. Don't forget the onion rings and the truffle fries"}
{"text":"We got a lovely surprise... My fiance took a bite of our lovely nachos and ended up with a mouth full of cheese flavored plastic. The waiter scooped it up and had it replaced immediately but after spitting up a huge chunk of plastic we were like \"ehhh,no thanks.\" The waiter persisted and quickly brought out a fresh plate. We were surprised to see that they were not taken off our bill. We didn't even get an apology from the manager. The burger was good enough but my hot dog was pretty gross. I was so excited too. Gordon is my absolute favorite. Oh the disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is a 2.5... I didn't really care for the burger at all! The only reason you should come here for is for the onion rings! They do have great customer service though.."}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy. We decided to do take out instead. I gave them my cell so they could text me when my burgers were done. It was going to take 35 mins. Lucky for them, it's part of a casino/mall so we had plenty of things to keep us busy. After almost an hour and no text, I returned to see how the order progressed. The girl returned w my order all ready. To my disappointment it looked like it was sitting there a while and the burgers were not hot.   We had the Hog and it was well made. Pink in the inside and favors well balanced. I also had one w curry spice. Wasn't what I expected but it was still good. No sides w order. Spent almost $40 for 2 burgers n tips. Great to try but I won't do it again. It's not bad but also not that that great."}
{"text":"My God, this was the best burger I have had in a long time. Besides the wait, I guess other people like great food too, the food was pretty quick and our sever was really nice and personable. Even though it was twenty something for the burger and a couple bucks more for the fries, I will definitely swing by the next time I'm back. While you wait, walk around the corner and check out Tipsy Robot. Fully customizable drinks from a robotic bartender."}
{"text":"I have never had a burger that was so good in my life. The burger was cooked to perfection and the truffle fries were incredible! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"What an amazing burger. I ordered the F word burger which wasn't on the menu yet. Wow! The best burger I ever had. I really hope they open up a place out here in New York. If I ever go to Vegas, coming here will be a must!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, the Hell's Kitchen burger was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Considering this is a \"Gordon Ramsey\" restaurant, the food was delicious at a surprisingly good value. (Paid $16 for the burger, $9 for the Cheddar Ale Soup) Since the restaurant is quite a landmark, the wait time for us was around 1 hour and 45 minutes, but we didn't have to wait in line and just waited for our text notification. Our waiter, Paul, was super warm and friendly. Overall the atmosphere was great, the staff was pleasant, and the food was extremely filling."}
{"text":"We came last night after trying Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris hotel. We only waited about 15 minutes for a party of 2. We came with high hopes and left extremely disappointed after the service we received. We both have worked in the service industry for years so maybe we were a bit critical but this bordered on ridiculous.  After 12 minutes of being seated, our server  greeted us with \"Did you decide what you want yet?\"   Not a hello, not a \"welcome, have you been helped?\"..poor server looked bored and tired. With an unapproachable demeanor she made us and apparently her other tables look a little hesitant to ask questions. We ordered water and cocktails, but our water glasses were empty for 25 minutes and cocktails didn't arrive until our food did.   Appetizers arrived briefly, chips and curry were slightly cold but good.   A whole 45 minutes later our burgers arrived. The meat was delicious and the flavors mixed perfectly, but the server never checked up on us after we started eating. Server was no where to be found when we wanted some limes, and only saw her maybe twice the whole evening.   We had to remind her several times to refill our water, and at the end of the meal when we asked for a box she looked at me as if I spoke to her in an alien language.   If you want to truly experience Gordon Ramsay: try the steakhouse and their amazing beef Wellington and ask for Victor, he will treat you like a proper server should and make sure your experience is worthwhile. You won't wait nearly and hour for your food and you'll leave fat and happy."}
{"text":"One of the best burger in town. Queue was pretty long for about 1 hour, although there are several empty seats inside. Meat is tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming. The best part of the burger was the bun. We should have known this! Gordon ramsey is not known for burgers.   I ordered the Crown burger (mimento cheese, arugula, sun dried tomatos). Their burgers do not come with sides so you will have to order separately. We ordered onion rings and those were delicious. They came with 2 dipping sauces.  Would recommend going somewhere else for burgers...or food for the matter. Their only salvation was Gordon's pretty picture on the wall."}
{"text":"I figured a burger with Gordon Ramsey's name connected to it would be delicious. I was wrong. The burger had very little flavor and the toppings only seemed to cover half the burger. The truffle fries were awful and after trying a few bites, it wasn't worth it to eat anymore for wasted calories. The fries were thicker spears and were not crisp on the outside and the \"truffles\" and cheese seemed to be an afterthought. I could have gone to Five Guys and paid a 1/3 of the price and had a delicious burger and fries for takeout. Gordon would be screaming in the kitchen if he knew or cared. Plus it took 50 minutes just to get a burger and fries to go."}
{"text":"OMG!!! The burger was spectacular!! Yes, there was a long wait, but IT IS WELL WORTH IT!!! I will return for this divine food experience! Thank you"}
{"text":"The food was DELICIOUS!!!! My burger was as juicy as ever and full of flavor. And our server, his customer service was 1st class. I am happy to say I look forward to coming to Vegas more often and definitely will be eating here again. @gordonramsay my friend says these burgers were made with a lot of cuss words  YOU'RE THE BEST GORDON RAMSAY!!!"}
{"text":"I walked up to the place, inside of planet Hollywood, and there was a giant line. So I saw a couple of single seats open at the bar, so I asked the hostess if they were available, and got instant seating. I got the burger with the egg on it it was fantastic. I also got the truffle Parmesan fries and they were terrific as well.  I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"If you love burgers, and are tired of Burgers as usual, then this place is for you.  The restaurant is located inside Planet Hollywood Casino and can be a little challenging to find depending on which entrance you come through.  Dress code is casual. There was a little wait to be seated but the food was delicious!  I took a recommendation from my server and got the Uber burger with mango chutney added.  It was a 10! I also got a side of the truffle fries which are large enough to be shared by two people.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviews our service was excellent. Our fries arrived cold, and old. We received another batch which was just as bad. At the end or server removed them from our check without us even asking. I had a Hells kitchen burger which was good but it was just a burger. After waiting in line for 30 minutes I felt kind of silly."}
{"text":"Been to this place numerous times. When Gordon Ramsay ran it, it was the best place in town. Now that the casino runs the place, the quality and service has suffered greatly. Menu changes were disappointing.  There are better burger places in Las Vegas. Not going back and will no longer recommend to friends coming to town."}
{"text":"Came into this spot with high hope and buy they didn't disappoint. I had the Hells Kitchen Burger and it was by far the best burger I've ever had. I tried the truffle fries as well and they were also amazing! I couldn't be more happy with the service I had either. Our server was amazing and fast. Best bite I had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on our last night and have decided that this is definitely a must eat place for us! The hog burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger were to die for. So many flavors and a decently sized burger. The down side is that your burger does not come with fries you have to order those separately, definitely get the truffle Parmesan fries you won't regret it! Also the \"spicy\" Hell's Kitchen burger is what this white girl calls white/old people spicy, it does not pack much heat but was still a fantastic burger! The service is amazing as it should be, just ask your waiter what they had to go through to be a waiter there; they'll have quite a story for you!"}
{"text":"The burger was out-of-this-world good! It was very juicy and flavorful. By far the best burger I've ever had. The wait to eat was very short and the wait for food was about 20 minutes. The staff was great and the environment is open and casual."}
{"text":"Spectacular... now I know watching Gordon's shows why he get so upset about the taste of other ppl food because there is nothing that compair to the flavor of his food. Like no other"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best burger I've ever had.  We were so pleased with our meal the first time, when we went back to Vegas a year and a half later, we returned and the burgers continued to live up to what we remembered.  I highly recommend the parmesan truffle fries."}
{"text":"Okay, four stars because the food was amazing. Best sliders I've ever had- buns so fresh and soft, light crisp. Chicken cooked so well. Just a medley of flavors. I forget the name but they were the ones with \"Parma ham\" and an aioli. Will post the name soon.  Tandoori chicken burger - awesome. The texture IS a little drier than I would have liked but it worked really well. I think it's meant to be like this. Definitely not something I could make at home I don't think.  Wouldn't give 5 stars bc the wait honestly was a buzz kill. I would have just liked to hop on the bar and eat there but the line included bar spots too. And no one was taking them regardless.  Plenty of TV's to watch the games that are on.  Order right when you sit down-- take a menu and check it over while waiting. Each burger takes 30 min to make  so be sure to snag a menu in line.  Also didn't like how slow the service was all together. But it was relatively crowded when we were there. I'll keep it at 4 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant ruined my experience in Vegas. My family and I heard of this restaurant and were told it was one of the best. When we went to eat we started off with a 50 minute line. Once we got to the cashier we were told that we would have to wait another hour and a half. After waiting for so long we just wanted some water. There was a bar right next to the cashier with a Gordon Ramsay background so we asked for water. Surprisingly the person who worked there needed an ID to give us water so my aunt showed an ID and she said that she would not give us the water until we back away from the bar, so we did. Once the table was ready we went in and ordered drinks and food. I never knew I would enjoy the drink more than the food. We ordered 3 hamburgers, 2 regular and one with no onions and to add mushrooms. We ended up getting 3 regular ones which one contained a long piece of hair which couldn't have been ours for sure and another with no mushrooms and with onions. We politely told the waitress that the order was wrong and that there are no mushrooms. She then started raising her voice saying she \"sees the mushrooms inside\" and we opened up the burger showing her there are none. The waitress kept saying we were wrong and wouldn't ask if she could do anything to help. We then asked her so please call the manager so we can figure this out. She started yelling at our table in front of everyone saying \"your so rude no costumer ever talked to me Like that\" as if we did something wrong. The manager came and heard us out and in the middle she started shaming us on how it's our fault for not being \"clear.\" He then told her not to talk or go near us but that didn't stop her from cussing out every one of us every time she would walk by. We walked out of there not wanting to ever go back even if the meals were free."}
{"text":"I'll be positive as this was not a positive experience. But, a lot of it was the service, not really the food.  Long line - go hit a slot machine first for your drink to stand in line.  35 minute minimum wait Sat at bar. Bartender w no personality. Never seen this in Vegas before. I asked if he had an eta and he said on what? Lol. My food bud. He said 35 minutes. I said well we are at 34 minutes. Thx for the notice.  Don't know if I ever got asked for another beer or refill. It's cool. I'm at a bar at a restaurant I'm Vegas. Lol. Burger was ok. I make a good burger, wanted excellent !"}
{"text":"I came here with very high expectations. I was very disappointed, I thought it was only me but after we left I asked my husband what her thought he said, \"it's alright\". The onion rings are good and crunchy. They taste like a Funyun potato chip. So the star of the show should be the Burger, right? Uh, no. It took 45 minutes to get our food. Our waiter apologized because it takes usually \"30 minutes\" as he said in the beginning. I think 30 minutes is too long so for me, 45 for a forgettable burger is just ridiculous . Our food comes and I'm excited.   My medium burger had zero pink. The grilled tomatoes looked like it was just thrown on there.  I take a bit and it taste whatever. Not bad, not good. Tasted like a dry well done burger. So I'm hungry and definitely not going to wait for a new one. Well I start eating and I realize the Burger becomes extremely hot tasting. Burn your mouth off, all you taste is chili, hot. I open the burger and the end of the chili they didn't take out all the seeds or forgot. It was so hot I could no longer eat it. Thank God it was only at 1 end, about 1/3 of the burger. My husband even said, \"WOW that is super hot, no way will I eat that.\" So I won't be coming back. Our waiter was nice and the staff was on it. The food was not anything to make a special trip over. Definitely not worth the average time of 30 minutes. Mediocre at best. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Holy shit Ramsey! Your food awesome! I love your youtube channel. I have learned so much. But your greeting staff is absolutely fucking terrible!! I have always loved you proficiency, this is not what I accepted from you professional standards. They told us 30min we waited 55min and there where 10 tables open. We were only a part of 2 and 4 parties of 8-12 went before us. What the fuck happened. Sort this out! Horrible just horrible! Rude staff that didn't give to cents about the eager paying customers. Please come down and whip some ass. Turn over the greeting staff ASAP!"}
{"text":"Burger was really good....expensive but good. The truffle fries were also pretty good."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere,  the burger taste very good.  The beer batter onion ring taste delious."}
{"text":"Best Burger In Las Vegas ! We sat on the bar where you can see the kitchen and was a great experience Will go back to this amazing place !"}
{"text":"The burgers are worth coming for. The hellfire wings don't taste that great not enough sauce on them tastes pretty bland, the fries ugh biggest disappointment of the night. Super thick starchy and not even crispy literally ended up not eating any of the fries ordered because they were way too thick. Tried telling the waiter, didn't look like he cared said it was something scientific to do with how the fries were made."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've ever had. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, it didn't dissappoint. There was a bit of a queue to be seated. It probably took about 40 mins for the food to arrive but it was worth the wait. The prices were reasonable too for a celebrity restaurant."}
{"text":"Burger was delicious. I had the Pork Chop and Applesauce Burger! Truffle fries were on point and waiter made sure everything was perfect! The wait time can be a bit long so get a few drinks and prepare to hang out in the line for a while. Wish you could make reservation priors but it's still worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We dined at Gordon Ramsay Burger on Friday evening. Our service was very good.  Six of us ordered the hamburgers since this is the specialty of this restaurant.  All of us ordered our hamburgers to be prepared medium to medium well.  Three of the six hamburgers were bloody and very undercooked. We had to send them back to be cooked longer.   The French fries were good.  This was my first and probably my last visit to this restaurant.  We were all quite disappointed by the quality of our meal."}
{"text":"Honestly, I can give 2 stars or even 1 because of the wait time, but the service of the waitresses is very good so I give 3 stars. We came almost 9pm, wait to get the seat for about 30-40 mins. I think since this is a famous restaurant, so it's reasonable. But the burger and the fries came almost 1 hour after we placed the order! I know that the restaurant is busy, but I don't think that it needs more than 30 mins to prepare burger, (especially because of Chef Ramsey's famous image) The waitresses keep coming and check on us and say sorry for the wait, they are very nice and friendly. About the burger itself, I was order the hell's kitchen, it is good and I give it 4 stars for the taste.  But the fries is just ok."}
{"text":"Thought it was another chef with his name on a regular burger... best burger I've had. Been coming here every time the last few years."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and was super disappointed. I asked for a burger med/well but more on the well side and it came out bright red. The waiter tried to argue with me that it was med/well when a friend next to me had a med/well with barely any pink. I'm pregnant so it is a big deal. Then it took FOREVER to get my new burger. Two friends finished their food and another waited to eat with me so hers was cold. Worst meal experience in a long time. Only reason I gave two stars instead of one is due to the fact their truffle fries were really good. Ps the burgers themselves aren't even very good."}
{"text":"Favorite burger place ever! The nachos are a must! The Oreo creme br√ªl√©e shake is fantastic! Each of us had different burgers and they were all excellent."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best burger I have ever eaten. Planning on going back before leaving Vegas!"}
{"text":"My Pick-up Request: After a long work day and several flight delays, we land in Vegas around 9 pm. We planned to pick-up the order and eat in our hotel room.   Right when I got into the taxi, I called the restaurant and asked if I can place an order for pick-up. She said \"no, you have to come in and order.\" When we arrived, we went straight to the restaurant to place the order.   However, the hostess said that I cannot place and order. I had explained that I called 15 minutes ago and was informed that I could. The hostess continue to say that I can only place the order for take-out before 5pm.   This was super frustrating! We were starving. So, we dropped off our stuff and ran down to wait in line for a sit-down meal. We waited in line for 30 minutes and ordered dinner around 11pm. We waited about 30 minutes for our burgers.   We ordered truffle fries, forest burger and blue cheeseburger. Everything was tasty except the forest burger. The forest burger is bland.   After the meal, I'm still annoyed about being misinformed."}
{"text":"This place ruined burgers for me. It was absolutely delicious, and even the appearance of the the burger was stunning. I love burgers and I am always searching for a good burger. My first bite was so juicy and the balance of the cheese with umami of the beef was such a great balance. I got the blue cheeseburger, my boyfriend got the farm burger, and his cousin got the U.K. burger. Everyone at that table was amazed on the flavor of their burger. The fries weren't something new to me and the reason I'm giving a four star is because of our server. He got our order and gave us the check. Other people checked up on us, gave us the drinks, and the food. Also when he asked for our order he just starred us down instead of speaking up like \"and what would you like to order,\" honestly is it that hard to do? There was a line but they got us in pretty quick. And as I've already mentioned the burger was spectacular and would love to get another burger from here again. Thanks to the chef who made our burgers!!!"}
{"text":"Ive been to this restaurant 8 times now and it's very consistent in quality, but they menu keeps changing. The burgers are very good and the service is great. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"By far the best burger I've ever had. I don't eat red meat and I got a turkey burger. I've eaten a lot of turkey burgers but never one they tasted exactly like a real burger. This one tasted like the real thing!! Ruined for all other burgers. Service was superb as well from the hostesses to waiter."}
{"text":"i have eaten only one time food is excellent i enjoyed the backyard burger ($15), sweet potato fries ($9), chocolate caramel tart ($7), pepsi ($4) cost plus tip $45.  if you want the one time experience eating gordon ramseybetter then go. as for a local i am going to in-n-out."}
{"text":"I really had my standards set high considering how many Gordan Ramsay shows I've watched. First, it was difficult for me to find this location considering that I'm a tourist lol. Parking was terrible but that's to be expected I guess. The decor was great. A wall on fire, multiple tvs. But why is it so squished? They truly tried to fit as many tables as they possibly could in here. Since it was the 2 of us we were seated within a minute. The waiter (I think his name was Sergio, I feel bad to have forgotten) was awesome. He let us know the burger would be at least half an hour, so we went ahead and ordered Just fries, truffle Parmesan fries, and the mushroom poutine. The just fries and the mushroom poutine came out first. The fries was deliciously crispy and lightly salted. I wasn't a big fan of their curry ketchup nor the Chipotle ketchup. The mushroom poutine was so bland! All of the toppings, and honestly had no flavor at all. Our waiter made no deal at all about taking it back and the manager came out to apologize and ask if he could get us anything else, so we asked for the sweet potato fries. Ommgggg. They come with a vanilla powdered sugar with its own shaker. SO BOMB. We ordered the Hells Kitchen burger and it came out at the same time as the truffle Parmesan fries. No words. The meat was juicy and just as I ordered, medium well. The chunk of avocado was perfectly ripe and had no imperfections. The avocado sauce it had was full of flavor. The bun was perfectly toasted and soft. The truffle Parmesan fries were amazing!! Bursting with flavor, perfectly crispy! We ended our meal with the chocolate creme brulee shake. Wow. Speechless. The chocolate shake was rich,decadent. I don't even like chocolate ice cream but wow. Our ending total was $68, so for the average person it is pricey, but honestly worth it. The customer service was incredible and I hope they continue to treat every customer the way we were treated."}
{"text":"The burger was good except for the amount Gordon Ramsey gets mad on his show, I'm surprised his workers don't know what a ripe avacado is. Our burger had a hard avacado on it."}
{"text":"I was curious try this place. Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area, we have many great burger places. We went around 3:30 and waited about 10-15 minutes. We opted to sit at a high top table.  I ordered the farm house burger. I really wanted the fried egg. I asked for my burger to be medium rare - basically red in the middle. It came more medium, pale pink the center. The burger was very tasty and well constructed.   My husband had the jalape√±o burger. He ordered his burger medium. It came closer to medium rare. He felt there was too much jalape√±o for him.  We also had the sweet potato fries. These were the best sweet potato fries! They were perfectly cooked and dusted with powdered sugar.    We also ordered the Oreo shake with 1/4 creme br√ªl√©e. That was the right amount of creme br√ªl√©e without it being overpowering. The shake was too thick for straws so we spooned it up. Delicious!  Service was very good. Our server was prompt and just attentive enough. Overall, it was a little spendy for burgers but very good."}
{"text":"We live in Las Vegas and have been going to BurgER for the past couple of years whenever we have company.  I always get the Britannia burger and the truffle fries!  Oh my gosh!   What a delight.  My mouth waters just thinking about the not too sweet burger.  Well, now I want another one!"}
{"text":"The service I received was genuine and very personalized, I can't say enough good things about their customer service. The food took some time to prepare but was well worth the wait. The flavors in the burger complimented perfectly and they had a great beer selection to along with it. I ordered the Parmesan fries and the Farmhouse Burger and it was plenty of food, in fact the fries could have been shared with someone else easily. Great atmosphere and great food, I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Every year that I come back to Vegas I come here. Burgers are amazing including their chicken burger. Fries are fabulous. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"Called while walking from the top of Planet Hollywood to the bottom (where the restaurant is located) to check on making a reservation and wait time. Jessica stated that they did not take reservations, that there was currently in line, though she did not promise it would not change. As it took me and my family less than 6min to get there after the call I was not worried. When we arrived, there was a huge line. When I went to the front desk, the person in charge was rude and dismissive. I asked why if I had called less than 6min ago they didn't inform me that it would be a 40min wait with a possibility that they would close before my family and I could go in. He stated \"I don't know why someone would say that, this like has been that big all day today.\" And walked away without a knife ounce of acknowledgment that Jessica had messed up and furthered ruined our plans. It was terrible customer service and there was no need to lie."}
{"text":"I would just like to thank all of the team members at Ramsay Burger.  Saw Gorden plug on it and took my family a few hours we got in to town.    Later that night I spent a good 10+ with food poisoning. The Dr. Said it could be from not washing there hands, bad food etc.   You have provided the most amazing start to my hard for time off.. Thanks you and your team of donkey!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. Our server did not check on us as often when we needed things. He was in the corner talking with other employees, we had to waive him but otherwise everything else was amazing"}
{"text":"Welp. Wanted to be like the cool kids and give this a shot.   THE GOOD:  1. Line moved quickly. We took under 10 mins at 7.30pm to get a table.   2. Whatever ketchup they used was awesome!  THE OK:  1. Service was slow.   2. Food was ok. I ordered the Forest Burger, which had mushrooms, cheese and duck bacon. Bacon tasted good. Beef pattie was tough unfortunately, and the mushrooms were overlooked little rubber tires. I asked for lettuce wrapped and they were great with that. So that was good. But the food was forgettable. Wouldn't come back.   3. Husband ordered The Farmhouse Burger. He tells me it was a 7/10 so that is good!  3. The fries were good. Not perfect, but good. Solid effort.   THE BAD:  1. My biggest complaint was the ambience and NOISE!!!! Good grief, if I wanted my ears to bleed I would have gone to a frikken Iron Maiden Concert. There is No carpet anywhere and the noise just resounds to the point where you have  to SHOUT to be heard. I am in the audiology industry and 85 dB is where hearing loss begins to occur as a result of noise damage, and I clocked an average of 83dB in this restaurant. So damn loud to the point of super uncomfortable. Just bad form Gordon.   2. TVs were broken down and not playing- kind of added to the vibe of lack of care.   All in all, for the price, I wouldn't come back due to the noise and lack of ambience. For my money, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The wait was too long. The food terrible. For all Gordon Ramsey brags about... not worth."}
{"text":"Best burger ever.  Best onion rings...EVER.  and the milkshake while it brings all the boys in yard...I wouldn't share because it was too good to share."}
{"text":"Burger was good but the truffle fries were a shame. It was overfried making it so hard to bite."}
{"text":"Realistically this is 3.5 stars, but that's not an option on yelp. While our waitress was friendly, the food itself was only mediocre/decent. Had the truffle fries and Hell's Kitchen burger and also tried the F Word burger. Everything was decent but not perfect. I've had better truffle fries at other restaurants and my burger was pretty tasty but one large jalape√±o pepper was in the middle and burned my mouth because it just came out of nowhere. I personally think that the F Word is much better. Overall, not bad but not amazing. Location is great though."}
{"text":"Chef Gordon Ramsey is my favorite chef. Burgers are amazing, shakes are amazing, the atmosphere is amazing as well. Good service, great food what else could you ask for."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal here with great service and reasonable pricing. The line to get in was a little long but it went surprisingly fast. We used the time to meet some great people from New Zealand. I would suggest a burger, the meat is fresh and hand prrssed. Great seasoning and buns."}
{"text":"The best burger Ever! There was a bit of a lineup, but patience really paid. They were kind enough to offer to text us when our table was ready, so we didn't to have to wait in line when so much can be done around! They have a very decent wine list by the glass. The ingredients are superb, and the taste combination, truly awesome! The Hog burger was absolutely perfect, as were the other burgers chosen by my companions. They also offer a few appetizer options, but you really ought to go there for the burgers!"}
{"text":"Always entertained by Ramsay's TV shows..so thought we would give one of his restaurants a try.  Disappointed!  Every bite was pure SALT!  Had the mushroom burger, turkey burger and truffle fries.  It all tasted the same...salty!  Giving 2 stars for good service only!"}
{"text":"The hype isn't all that. The server got our order wrong and service didn't exist here. I've been to Vegas multiple times and as a food network fan I have always wanted to try one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. But every time I walk past it the long lines make it real discouraging.   I've finally got a chance to try it. Typical wait but much shorter(about 20 minutes). When we were finally greeted by the host and brought inside It was empty! There were at least 10 tables that were open so I don't understand what the wait was about. When we finally sat down the waitress took forever to come take our order. When she finally did we ordered a 'Hells kitchen burger' and truffle fries. The burger took awhile to come and when it did it was the wrong burger! They gave us the ultimate cheese burger! When we told her it was the wrong burger she didn't ask if we wanted a new one made she took another 10 minutes to go get the rest of the toppings and came back with a plate of it. She gave us a small plate with roasted tomatoes, avocado, and a cup of aioli sauce as if she was saying 'here make ya own damn burger.'  The burger was very mediocre. It was too dry for my taste. I expected a juicy burger filled with flavor. For someone who made a living off of criticizing other people's restaurants maybe Ramsay needs to check into his own."}
{"text":"I went with my family and got stuck at the kids table  unfortunately. But nonetheless, server was super nice and accommodating! The fries were the BOMB and the burger was delicious"}
{"text":"By far, the best burger I've ever had! I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger with side of Truffle Fries to share. The meat was tender and juicy with a kick of spicy-ness. The customer service was friendly and attentive. Be prepared to wait to get a table, I checked in with the hostess, and killed time gambling in the Planet Hollywood casino until I got a text message that my table is ready. I highly recommend calling ahead of time to see what the wait times are."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved our two visits to Ramsay's Burger restaurant. Each time I ordered without the bun and my husband ordered with the bun. We were both enjoying every bite. The Parmesan truffle fries and decadent and tasty.  They come with two sauces which are fine, but next time I want mustard (just my preference.) I tried the chicken tikka burger without the bun, and loved the spices! I would order this again. My husband ordered the same thing both times because he loved it so much, and it was served exactly the same on both occasions. The beer is pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. We arrived at 2:30 but waited for 20mins, which is acceptable cause Ramsay has so many fans. We ordered sweet potato fries, hell kitchen burger, blue cheese burger and farm burger. They are just good/ok/not bad. They are not WOW. Maybe I expect too much"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had in my life, period! As a die-hard In-N-Out fan, I used to view Burger as a fast and convenient eat. After trying Gordon Ramsay Burgers, it totally changed the way how I used to perceive Burgers, I had never thought Burgers could be this delicious. I was totally awed by their creativity in combining so many different ingredients to make each burger so unique and delicious. This is not only making a burger, but this is also making an art!   During my stay in Vegas, I had the opportunities to try the following:  1. Farmhouse Burger(Rating 5/5)-The bun which grilled over the apple wood has a slight sweet taste to it and combines so well with beef, cheese,duck bacon and egg. This is a very traditional style burger can be served in many places, but the way Gordon Ramsay does it and the ingredients used making it THE BEST!  2. Lobster and Shrimp Burger(Rating 4.5/5)-The pickled vegetables, aioli combined with the lobster and shrimp patty was incredible. You get the taste of the sweetness and sourness of the pickle vegetables and the ocean taste of the shrimp and lobster all in one bite. The only downside is that the shrimp flavor overshadowed the lobster.  3. Hog Burger(Rating 4.5/5)-The pork patty combined with bacon tasted very juicy, tender and crunchy at the same time and the pickled cucumbers gives a slightly sour taste. Very very good.  4. Just Fries(Rating 5/5)-The potatoes they used were so fresh, clearly hand cut, not frozen and were fried perfectly. It comes with two different sauces: traditional tomato sauce and the spicy tomato sauce, both you can tell easily are home made and both taste are OUT OF THIS WORLD when you dip in the fries. I have never had any fries this delicious before.  The price is significantly steeper than a fast food chain like In-N-Out or Shake Shack, but I believe the quality and the taste made it worth every penny.   I sincerely wish Gordon Ramsay Burger can be opened in LA one day. I will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Forest Burger is life...yum. One star off because it's a little hard to get a table and it took us two tries to make it to get seated. Really good!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had! The garlic truffle Parmesan fries are AMAZING!!!! I got the crown burger which was great. Almost got the Hell's Kitchen burger but wasn't too crazy about the jalape√±os. The sweet potato fries were so so. Nothing great. My mom got the blue cheese burger and said it was amazing!!! Long wait but so worth it."}
{"text":"The name alone attracts most tourists (I really wanted to bump into Gordon Ramsay and have him yell at me for my lack of cooking skills), but the food will not let you down.  The menu describes every burger down to the T, so if you like your burger a certain way or enjoy the creativity the choices offer, then definitely go with your instincts and let your stomach order. The burgers are huge and the fries are as well so you can always share with a friend if you need to. I will say though, be careful of the truffle fries... the taste is really strong!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!!! No words to describe this place. I came here with high expectations and they were definitely exceeded! You really cannot expect nothing but the very finest from Gordon Ramsay. The never ending line out the door speaks volumes as to how amazing the food is here.   My husband and I came here for lunch right before the rush started so the wait in line was only about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad compared to other times we checked to see the wait time and it was at 2.5 hours!!! (Insanity!) we finally got to the front of the line and we're seated. Service was great here (Gordon Ramsay has trained everyone very well here lol).   We ordered the Caesar salad was the best I've ever had. It was a unique twist with Romaine lettuce, baby kale and thinly sliced green apples and radishes which added a nice zest to the salad tossed in their house made Caesar dressing which was phenomenal. Then we got the onion rings, French fries, and the portobello mushroom burger.  We enjoyed every bite of our food!   Definitely deserve five stars! We will definitely be coming back thank you so much for the amazing food and service!!"}
{"text":"Okay...let's start with the positives. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was amazingly delicious! The reason for the 3 starts is because 1. I ordered my burger well done and it has soooo much pink that they had to take it back to recook (3 other people at my table had the same issue) 2. The service was mediocre and the waitress didn't come buy enough to check on us 3. The burgers took 45 once the order was placed 4) For the price of the burgers and fries it wasn't worth it.  I got the Parmesan truffle fries and I did not like them at all. There was way too much Parmesan cheese on it  The manager was very apologetic about the burgers not being cooked how we ordered them so she gave us 10% off and everyone got a free dessert! Now the dessert is amazing!!! I tried to Oreo and chocolate shake and YUM!! The Oreo shake tastes better to me as the chocolate shake was very rich.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have been twice now. Once on my own and once with my wife. On my own I was able to get a seat at the counter right away. With my wife we made an effort to get in line at 10:30am so we could be sat as soon as they open. When going here expect a wait. It is very popular and for good reason. It is located in Planet Hollywood on the north end of the casino.   Service was excellent both times. The burgers are extremely flavorful. The bun is delicious. There are many good options to choose from.   On my visit with my wife, Gordon himself actually stopped in. I was very impressed that the first thing he did was walk around and shake every single employee's hand and thank them. Clearly a good guy to work for if you do your job right.   Plan accordingly for the wait, and I think you will find this place to be worth it. Plus a 30 minute wait really is no big deal."}
{"text":"My gf and I had about an hour before our show was going to start so we wanted to grab something to eat. We walked over to Planet Hollywood and we saw there was no line here at 6pm. My gf was craving a burger and had always wanted to eat here, soooooo off we went. There was a wait of 5 minutes to which we avoided by sitting at the chef's table. Normally we love to sit at the chef's table, but this table was different. We sat right next to where the servers roll the silverware. So the staff would dump the silverware into the bucket and it was like nails on a chalkboard over and over again. We did our best to ignore it, but it was tough for sure. We looked back outside and there was now a line of 20 people!   The benefit of sitting at the chef's table is you get to see all the food as it comes out. In addition there is plenty of staff there to help if you need more drinks, items or just have questions. When our server greeted us, he immediately let us know there was a 30-40 minute wait for food. We decided to chance it and order food possibly missing a few minutes of the show. Plus at most places they over estimate those times to cover themselves, usually it's half that time.   We decided to go w/ their specialty burger of the day, to which they only make a certain amount of. I'm not sharing what that is due to not knowing if they only serve it particular days of the week, certain months or if it's a one time thing. I wouldn't want to get your hopes up. In addition to that burger we ordered the 'Hells Kitchen' burger - asadero cheese, roasted jalape√±os, avocado, roasted tomatoes, jalape√±o aioli  We kept watching food come out and hoping it was ours. It was starting to close in on that 30-40 minute mark. We hadn't see our server since dropping off our drinks and taking our order. Like magic he appeared when the food arrived. To which I quickly asked for the check. The manger on duty came to us to apologize for the wait and ask if we needed anything else. I informed her of the lack of attention our server gave as we sat there and how our waters weren't refilled during the time we got them until the time we got our burgers.  Once we started digging into these burgers, we realized it was worth the wait. Typically it can be hard to wow me w/ a burger at a particular price, but maaaaaaaaaaan were these burgers good! The specialty was $25 and the Hells Kitchen burger was $16. Both well worth the wait and price.   If you are craving a burger on the strip, def check this place out! Just make sure you get a table and not the chef's table."}
{"text":"Nice waiter but the food was bad. My nachos came out in like 10 seconds and it's cold. Fries were awful and burger was okay"}
{"text":"Three stars takes into account the price, time of wait and quality of meat.  This was a very good burger overall. The cheeses, sauces, shoestring onions were all tasty. The bun with light and fluffy and was a nice complement to the meat. The burgers were cooked appropriately to my medium request. The house ketchup was excellent. However for a 45 minute wait and 20 dollar burger I expect to have some kind of unique beef like an aged prime beef that is ground in house. The burger itself was bland. The toppings were all unique and quite good. But For 18-22 dollars per burger and 60 dollars for lunch I expect more. Save yourself some time and money and go to earl of sandwich right down the hall."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to get a burger. I've been here a couple of times. The consistent highlights are the milkshakes. Specifically the Oreo Milkshake with Creme Br√ªl√©e topping is possibly the best milkshake I've ever had. It's small and expensive, but we're in Vegas so it's worth every penny.  The burgers themselves are pretty good too. The Hell's Kitchen burger is spicy and balanced whereas The Crown burger I found to be over seasoned and a bit bland otherwise. The burger buns stand on their own though. They're soft and pillowy but also sturdy and soak up the burger juices without falling apart. They're buttery and have a good flavor from the sesame seeds. A perfect bun really.  The fries are pretty blah. I've had better many places. I like my fries crisp on the outside and soft in the middle and I feel like these lack a bit on the outside crispiness. The poutine is OK if you like mushrooms, though I've had better back home.  So if you're a Ramsay fan stop here and grab a Hell's Kitchen and shake!"}
{"text":"Excellent! My son and I just happened to pass by and decided to stop. The wait time was about 20-30 minutes for a Monday night. I ordered the farmhouse burger and my son order the shrimp and lobster burger. Both were excellent and the truffle fries with the aioli sauce were absolutely delish! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying this place so I hate giving it two stars but the burger and fries just weren't good. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and my husband got the Blue Cheeseburger. The patties were cooked well but there was NO flavor. It tasted like an unseasoned mash of beef and avocados. If I didn't know that there were jalape√±os in there, I would never have been able to guess. I had to asked for ketchup and slathered mine in it to finish it. My husband tried mine and said his was only slightly better. I didn't try his since I don't like blue cheese so it wouldn't have been a fair assessment. The fries were the same consistency throughout, no texture on the outside. They were just slightly limp cuts of potato. The only saver of the night were the onion rings. Now those were THE BEST onion rings of my life, and I don't typically go for them. The servers were great so with that and the onion rings, I think two stars is fair. WAH, I so wish I would give a better review but that only comes with a better burger."}
{"text":"I really thought this place would be all hype. Granted, I went anyway, but I didn't actually expect to get what I paid for.   If you are in Vegas, go to Gordon Ramsay Burger. PLEASE!! My friend and I each got a different burger. I got the bleu cheese burger, she got the Hell's Kitchen burger. Get hers. The Hell's Kitchen burger was so freaking delicious!!! Mine was great, but I really can't get over how good hers was!  The burgers are so juicy. We both ordered ours medium well, hers actually came out over cooked, well done, and was still juicy. We later learned that if you tell them that, they'll get you a new burger within minutes. Our server seemed pretty bummed that we didn't tell her sooner. So please note that. They really care that you enjoy your food.   I also enjoyed that you can keep the menu as a souvenir. I initially thought it was a little cheap for a Ramsay establishment to have laminated paper menus, until she said that, then it all made sense.   If you're hungry, I'd go another day. It takes around 20 minutes for the burgers to come. And they're pretty hearty, so I'm not sure if I'd load up on appetizers. You know what you can eat better than I.   Also, I must stress to get the truffle fries!! It comes with their house ketchup AND a truffle aioli. We actually added the aioli to our burgers and it took them up a million notches! Do it. You won't be sorry!!! This is coming from someone who dislikes mayonnaise, it's so good!!! And you can literally see chunks of truffle inside. Totally worth it.    I will point out that burgers and fries are separate. Entries don't come with sides, but the burgers are so good they really can stand alone! I'll be back the next time I visit to try another sandwich. I know it'll be worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the uber cheeseburger. How can a burger be so good that's just meat, cheese and bun? Best thing ever!"}
{"text":"Finishing a trade show at 10:30 and trying to find decent food is a challenge, especially with four sober men who need a beer and some burgers. Stoked GRB was open. Great beer selection and menu. Buddy had a lobster burger and liked it, I had the farm stand burger and felt -yeh. It was kind of like eating a fancied up Johnny Rockets burger. The truffle fried and onion rings made up for it. Worth and shot just know its pricy... like all burgers on the strip."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. My husband is a huge GR fan so we had to get to one of his restaurants while in Las Vegas. The downside is there is usually a pretty long wait. We arrived at 5pm on a Thursday and had to wait approximately 30 min for a table. The service could have been better/more attentive and the dining room is very, very cramped and crowded. But the food more than makes up for it. One of the best burgers I've eaten in awhile."}
{"text":"It's a very good option for gourmet burgers. The F-Burger is not listed in the menu (beef and barbecue pulled pork) and Lobster & shrimps are the best. Include chicken wings as entree. Ask fries with truffle mayonnaise. A drafted beer like New Castle it's a must."}
{"text":"I mean, can you really go wrong with one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants? Everything was delicious. I definitely recommend the blue cheese burger and the crown burger. Don't waste your time and money eating burgers anywhere else in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great burger, great appetizers, great desserts, and most importantly great service!  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was very sophisticated in flavor and very well composed.  The pickled  Jalapenos were a bit too spicy for my taste but I enjoyed every bite of it.  Appetizers and fries were very unique and also very rich in flavor.  The fries were soggy and wasnt freshly fried, hence the one star knocked off.  Desserts were a bit overwhelmingly large in amount, simple and nicely done. I had the crem brulee oreo shake which was very well balanced, not too sweet, not too chunky with oreo.  Overall, I would come back to Gordon Ramsay Burger on my next visit to Las Vegas, and I can assure you it is well worth the extra price for a nice burger."}
{"text":"Ordered poutine and Hell's Kitchen burger. Best burger I've ever had! Service is also good. Had margarita the other day. It's too sweet to me. But definitely will recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had a Curried Shrimp Salad on my visit! Are at the bar and had great service! My drinks were perfect and the salad was memorable. Delicious big shrimp with tasty dressing, almonds and apples. No it's not a burger...it is still worth a visit!"}
{"text":"2nd visit with the husband and 1st visit with the kids. Everyone loved their burgers and my husband couldn't stop talking about the Mediterranean Burger. Everyone in this restaurant is so friendly and accommodating. It was a long wait to be seated, but completely refreshing when the staff thanked us for our willingness to wait. Jonathan the GM introduced himself to our table, and was buzzing around the restaurant greeting other guests, seating guests, and removing dishes from tables. The food is amazing, the staff is out of this world, and we will always come back. My kids were only disappointed that Gordon wasn't there yelling at somebody."}
{"text":"Visited on 1-6-18. We loved it! A bit of a wait to be seated and for your food. Got the cheese burger and we shared fries. Definitely would recommend and go back."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay definitely knows what he's doing! Been here twice and I really enjoyed it. It's usually busy but I came here at 10pm on a Sunday and didn't have to wait at all. The first time was with a big party and I think we only waited for 20-30 minutes, so not bad.  We got the ahi tuna sliders as an appetizer - it was really good. But heads up, it's only two sliders on the order! I got the Farmhouse Burger, which comes with cheese, bacon and an egg. My boyfriend says you should always get it done Gordon Ramsay style, medium rare. Delicious, juicy and flavorful! My boyfriend got the Hell's Kitchen burger and he said it was alright. We also shared an order of Truffle Parmesan Fries. SO GOOD. Definitely enough to share between a couple.   The menu has many other different kinds of burgers, even hot dogs and milkshakes. I saw a lot of tables order the onion rings too, and it smelled and looked so good!"}
{"text":"This here place puts together an honest burger at an honest price.  Be prepared to wait in a long line if you decide to show up at normal dinner hours."}
{"text":"This place has some awesome burgers and very good fries. The spicy jalepeno burger is great if you like spicy food. I gave it a 4, because it's very expensive. Look to pay at least 30 or more per person if you want a burger, fries and a drink. Burgers are approximately $16 each and fries are $8 on up. It's definitely a great place to try if you haven't been. Ask for your burger to be cooked well, if you don't want any pink."}
{"text":"One of my friend wanted to check out this place after passing by the restaurant. There seems to be a long line for lunch and dinner, but if you have a party of 4 or more, they will give you a pager and you wouldn't need to stand in line.   The food was mediocre. To me, it was nothing more than an all-American burger joint with Ramsay's name (and price tag) attached to it. Burgers were about $17, which was not worth the money. The patty is a generous portion, so it's definitely possible to split a burger and order some gravy fries to share. Overall, we thought that the food was a bit too salty.  It was a fun experience to check out a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, but would I come back again? Probably not..."}
{"text":"Skip it. Skip it. SKIP IT! I have been in Vegas for a week and literally couldn't find a bad meal. I let my guard down. Fool me once... This was horrible. We ordered chicken wings and they were ice cold in the middle. Clearly precooked and reheated. So gross. I had to insist that I wouldn't pay for them, rather than being offered a comp. Burgers were sub par. Definitely nothing to write home about. Disappointed for sure. I expected way more from Gordon Ramsay. So sad."}
{"text":"We came here at around 4:30 and only had to wait less than five minutes before we were seated. We ordered truffle fries and some beer on tap. My husband ordered the blue cheese burger and I ordered the farm burger, both medium. We did wait a while to get our food but the waitress let it be known that there was an average of a 30-minute wait to get our food. We didn't mind. Shortly after being seated we saw the line get very long. The average wait time was about 40 minutes to be seated. Our burgers were excellent. Can't wait to come back and try some more."}
{"text":"So good and so juicy. Very large fries that was good for 3 people. Ypu need to wait in line if you a couple but definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is over rated. Except the the piece of meat, the rest of bun and veggies were below normal quality. Over priced for what you pay! It's just a one time try!"}
{"text":"Totally surpassed my expectations!  The truffle fries were off the hook!  Both of our burgers were amazing!"}
{"text":"I think Gordon would f*kng appalled and would tear into the staff here, especially the scruffy moist-lipped manager, standing there in his shiny-elbowed jacket with his shirt untucked, while his staff put drinks on our table, right under his nose, then shortly followed up to slide coasters underneath. Similar thing with our shared starters -- side plates for them arrived about 10 minutes later. The burgers were fine, but again, I'm not sure \"fine\" in that sense it what Gordon is after. I got The Crown Burger which has rocket/arugula and dried tomatoes. Sounds good but here's a thing: more arugula does not a better burger make, especially if you don't offset the dryness with more cheese. I love mimolette, surely everyone loves mimolette. give us more of that! This isn't fine dining, it's just fine. Prices are fine, wait was fine, service was fine, if a little amateur. Food was fine. F*ked off home."}
{"text":"Waiting over 45 minutes to get our food the service is horrific!!! The attitude of the waitress was like what do you mean the service is taking too long I'm a look at one of the good burger I guess I came to the wrong place"}
{"text":"3.5 stars Despite having been a life-long fan of Gordon Ramsay's TV shows like Hell's Kitchen, MasterChef, and the F-Word, I've never actually visited one of his restaurants, so on my recent visit to Las Vegas, Gordon Ramsay Burger was the place to go! Located in Planet Hollywood, the place has a casual \"sports-bar\" vibe, along with an open kitchen, and there were people of all different ages and group sizes eating at this busy restaurant. We started our meal with the parmesan truffle fries, which came with a spiced ketchup and truffle aioli on the side. I didn't find the fries particularly special (there was a distinct lack of truffle aroma/flavor), but the truffle aioli was chock full of amazing umami unctuousness, though the ketchup was just dominated by sweetness.  And then what we came for--the burgers! The Hell's Kitchen burger was a must-order, and it came with melted asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, roasted tomatoes, jalapeno aioli, and avocado. Plenty of fire and spiciness indeed (and the burger itself was nice and juicy), but otherwise, the flavors of the burger weren't all that interesting, and the bun turned out to be overly greasy with butter. I much preferred the Forest burger, which came with salty tremor cheese, forest mushrooms, arugula, and duck bacon. The flavors of this burger were very umami (thanks to the mushroom, cheese, and bacon), and the combination with the refreshing arugula worked very nicely! Again, however, the bun was way more greasy than necessary.  The burgers at Gordon Ramsay were good, but I can't say that they were the best I've had or necessarily worth the celebrity-chef price tag. I won't be in a rush to come back, but perhaps some of Gordon Ramsay's other restaurants in Vegas would be worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came on Sunday Night, late, line was short but wait about 15 minutes.  Young female hostesses laughing about things in their life as the customers wait with not even a greeting or an estimate or anything. I definitely felt there was no caring for the customer and wished Gordon Ramsay had walked in causing the hostesses to stand at attention and get people seated. The burgers are excellent, maybe the best I've ever tasted, but the onion rings were not 100% done, a bit doughy on the inside. For the price of these hamburgers I would have like to be treated with a little bit more respect.  Just not feeling anyone cared."}
{"text":"I'm a huge GR fan and this was my first visit to one of his restaurants. However, I'm pretty disappointed.   My waitress asked how I wanted my burger done, and I said well done. I don't like pink in my burger-- it grosses me out. I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger. I also ordered the truffle Parmesan fries. The cocktails are very strong! And yummy.  In less than 4 minutes my burger and fries came out. My burger looked delicious, until I bit into it. So raw, I could mush it (all I thought in this moment was that the cow was literally walking bc it was so rare, clearly I am obsessed with Ramsay). However, the ingredients were definitely fresh, the bun was perfect. The avocado was so huge, it was impossible to eat my burger without making a mess. So I mushed the avocado and then put it on my burger. No big deal, because it was a delicious and generous amount of avocado. The fries were a bit dry, somewhat crunchy, needed some salt, but tasted good once I dipped them in ketchup. You get a bunch of the French fries to share ($11).  I ate what was brown enough. The waitress said the manager took care of my burger which was really generous. I would come back for sure. But would probably choose a different burger and hopefully they make it well done next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was one of the best burgers I have had so far . I loved the ambience of the place . It was amazing , not over prized at all . Burgers ranging from 15-22. Also try there wings and fries in apps."}
{"text":"BurGR was always a staple for us during all of our Vegas trips. When we passed by on our most recent visit and saw that it got rebranded to Gordon Ramsay Burger, we were a little surprised, but it makes total sense seeing as how GR seems to be taking over the strip with new places.  The menu has been revamped. There are definitely new items, and there aren't Total Rewards discounts anymore. The shakes have also been redone so that they aren't just named by numbers anymore. All that being said, the quality of the food is just as good as it was. Juicy, medium rare burgers with heapings of mouthwatering toppings that will just barely fit into your mouth.  Farmhouse Burger. Still our classic go-to. A juicy burger topped with bacon and a fried egg. You know, just in case the burger itself wasn't enough protein for you. The bacon has been upgraded from duck bacon to mangalitsa bacon, which we're told is like the kobe beef of pork. What's mangalitsa, you ask? Google it. You won't be sorry.  Forest Burger. This one offers up more greens in the form of arugula and 'shrooms. Duck bacon still comes into play here though, so don't let the name fool you into thinking this is just made of rabbit food.  Just Fries. Because sometimes, you just want to be fries. Thick cut fries served with two sauces. One reminded me of a curry-like sauce and the other was more a traditional ketchup with a kick.  Didn't have room for dessert this time, but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. Quality not good enough for this price, overpriced IMO. We did order the truffle fries and onion rings, both were dry and really nothing special.   I think the habit burger grill (chain restaurant) is way better than this."}
{"text":"Really great Valentine's Day destination.  Saw over a dozen cute couples leaning towards each other whispering sweet nothings.  Unique menu with fun stuff to see."}
{"text":"Delicious Hell's Kitchen burger and truffle fries. The wait for four people was approximately 45 minutes (not bad for a Saturday) they texted and called us when our table was ready. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Long wait-time for very slow service and an average burger makes this an over-rated, over-hyped tourist restaurant just to check off a celebrity owned Vegas restaurant. Biggest issue here is the service. Our 45-minute wait time on a Friday afternoon was expected, but it took 1 hr between ordering and our food to come out, and an addional 20 min to get the bill after requested. There are a ton of workers buzzing but hardly come around - even just to refill water, let alone order. Fries are thick-cut, and average. Burger was good....but worth $15...no, however they did cook it to a great medium-rare. Curried shrimp salad was big for $15 with lots of shrimp and spiced well.  Ordered -Hell's Fire Burger -Backyard Burger -Curried Shrimp Salad"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie. I'm not GR follower so my expectations were nominal. We got right in on a Monday evening at prime time dinner time. The night before we passed by & there was a HUGE line way out into the casino. So I'd recommend reservations for sure. The burgers were stunning. Stacked high with toppings & a fresh baked bun. I had the lobster shrimp burger that was tasty wasn't impressive. It was on the dryer side due to preparedness. The rest of the table had juicy, delish perfectly prepared burgers. Kind of jealous I didn't order a more traditional burger. The table ordered & shared fries, sweet potato fries & onion rings. The fries were all thick cut crispy outside & pillowy delish potato on the inside & the dipping sauces were yum. The onion rings had a crispy beer batter & also a couple of traditional dipping sauces. The cocktails were as delicious as the were strong. The check did have a Vegas GR price tag on it so come prepared to spend some cash & enjoy your burger."}
{"text":"Ramsey would be pissed I sat down with a party of 4 host was very nice but the server was non existent we waiting over 10 minutes before we just got up and left it seemed all the severe wanted to do was chat with each other at their computer station should have expected it since as we walked in another group had approached the host table and asked where do we pay cause they had not seem their server in a long time very disappointing"}
{"text":"Hell's Kitchen burger and fries were the best I've ever eaten.  Tender delicious beef.  Perfect bun and delightful heat!  Not so hot it sears taste buds, but very very warm. Every bite was great!   Fries are huge hot planks and extra delicious with special dipping sauce.   Extremely organized and friendly staff managed a very large holiday crowd with ease. We will return!"}
{"text":"We had Kettle Nachos, Hells kit burger, Farmhouse burger and Truffle fries. Food and service were great. Nice and warm hospitality."}
{"text":"I had one of the best burgers ever here! I came with my staff, and the food was off the hook! We all enjoyed it immensely! The fries were super good! It's super busy so get there early or get a reservation!"}
{"text":"Food was 5/5, Hilary (our server) was 0/5. First off Id like to say I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay restaurants and in my recent visit to Las Vegas I made an effort to visit every single of his restaurants (Steak, Pub, Hells Kitchen, Fish and Chips, and finally Burger). All the other restaurants were fantastic and I loved the food including this one! So you might wonder why a 2/5.... The service was terrible our server was Hilary and I cannot say one good thing about her, after sitting down we waited about 15 minutes before she made our way to our table after coming to our table she looked like she was not interested in serving us because we looked younger and maybe wont tip as much as the table next to us who she was all over. After asking for a drinks menu it came about 10 minutes after I asked, then took another 20 minutes for our drinks order. Every time she came to our table she was terrible and I saw her going up to other servers laughing and just chatting. She was terrible and if you have her as a server please ask for someone else."}
{"text":"Normally when hubby & I travel we'll dine at a steakhouse & initially planned on going to Gordon Ramsay Steak at Paris until our son & his girlfriend convinced us otherwise to get burgers. So, why not? Our visit landed us here on a Wednesday evening about 4pm & we waited 5 minutes for a table. Appetizers looked amazing- especially their Cheddar Ale soup (which I really wanted to try $9) but- it didn't offer options for different portions. If there was a cup portion- I'd be all over it. Maybe next time. I really wanted to try Bangers & mash... but, kept scoping the menu til it caught my eye- Foie Burger!! How often do your tastebuds land on this?!  Foie burger: Foie gras spread; Chevr√® (goat milk cheese); fris√©e; port wine a√Øoli. I had to cut this burger in half- not that it was some huge gigantic thing... but, I wanted to see how it was layered. I'm neurotic this way, pardon me.  Foie gras spread on both buns- optimum juices flowed beneath burger patty! It took me a quick one to realize what caught my tastebuds attention! It was the Ch√®vre! I really don't like goat milk- but, it wasn't slathered thick at all.... and I was actually dealing with it well enough to eat every single bite of this burger! Super proud of myself.  The order of truffle parmesan fries comes w/ 2 condiments- ketchup w/ Tabasco sauce and truffle a√Øoli (you'll see flakes of truffle). Servers were kind enough to bring the curry AND chipotle ketchup too! That curry ketchup blew my mind! So glad these fries are steak cut!  Since we were told Gordon Ramsay liked the Innes & Gunn oak aged ale- why not?! There are notes of vanilla and toffee! Whoa! This ale was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This was the best part of my trip to Las Vegas.!! My wife & I were so excited to eat here. Best food ever!! Next time we are in Vegas this is going to be another for sure stop on our adventures!!"}
{"text":"For 15 bucks just for the burger you can get a much flavorful burger at shake shack for way less   Fries where waaaay over cooked"}
{"text":"We went here back in March & were in love. We went back in May and were disappointed the menu changed. The burgers we got were still amazing and we left stuffed. Be sure you stop by hostess stand if you have a larger party. All small parties have to just wait in line."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place OMG!!!! We went for late brunch and when we fall in love. Words can explain how amazing this place"}
{"text":"Our server Rick made sure we were set up. Just as if we were sitting on the set of Hells Kitchen. Rick recommended a burger for my son, and I. Also I let him pick the beer I washed my burger down with.  We started with a order of onion rings, fantastic. Lots of flavor. Light. Not greasy at all. Our burgers, and a order of fries that we split came out quickly.  Burger was done perfect. It was honestly 1 of the best burgers I have ever ate. Rick did a awesome job taking care of us both. Did a great job with his pairings. If you head there for lunch, or dinner...Rick is your guy"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had! Definitely don't go to Bobby's Burger Palace. Gordon's is waaaaayyy better and similarly priced. Also make sure you get the Fries!"}
{"text":"The service was awesome. The recommendations on point. Get a medium burger. Live your life (we didn't die) and it was amazing. Get two burgers. Skip the fries. The hot wings will melt your tits off. Ugh still thinking about how good the burgers were....it obviously is a very busy place but the best restaurant in planet Hollywood for sure."}
{"text":"Food is ok... I had no service at all for my table. Appetizers put in last.... I had to flag down food runners to get some service. Then a manager comes and resolves my water refilll. But still you call yourself a Gordon Ramsey restaurant I better receive that type of service... Disappointment for a vacation food."}
{"text":"So this week I am in Vegas for 2 days for my daughters roller derby game. My 2nd time in Vegas, my daughters 1st. We arrive at our #Airbnb which is 20 minutes from the strip at 4pm. I've been driving since 10 or 11am and at this point I am #HANGRY. So we start going back and forth about where to eat and not steer away from our #Whole30 ways. All of a sudden it was like a lightbulb went off. Wifey and I were like BUMP THAT!!! Where's Gordon??? \"I want a burger\"!!!  So we head over to the strip get to the restaurant and of course, there's a line from the door well into the casino. However, because we were only a party of 3 we didn't have to wait in that line. We did have a 45 minute wait time. So we walked around for a bit then came back after 30 minutes and ordered drinks at the bar. I look at the drink menu (which is a tablet) the bartender hands me and like a jerk, I start looking at the list of beers. First off, I hardly ever order a beer in my home state. It's a rule for my family, if you're out of town you do not order something you'd ordinarily get at home; if you do you are a jerk!   Anyway, I ordered the Honey Tennesse Jack Daniels peach cocktail for me and wifey and when I say we were so happy with those drinks I ordered 4 more for myself (in my mind). But I needed to eat and I was conflicted because everything sounded so good. Plus I wanted that seafood burger and the Anniversary burger so I got both and a poutine. I ordered it the way chef recommends and so glad I did. So flavorful and perfect portions. My only critique would be the seating booths are slightly too low, I felt kind of awkward at the table. Other than that the staff was great, warm a personable. We enjoyed every bite and will be back everytime we are in Vegas. #BaptisteClan"}
{"text":"Best of the best  Should try if you are in Vegas. Highly recommend the HK burger,it was really good."}
{"text":"It took one hour to get our food, but it was worth it. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger, and it was amazing. Although, it was overprice, I recommend this burger joint if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend and boy was he right. From the moment I stepped in the, the hostess Ms. Zeleida, greeted us, let us know there would be a few minute wait time, however,  got us seated immediately. She was very efficient, proffesional, and had excellent customer service. The server was aswell excellent, the good was amazing. I have to give this place inside the PH 5 stars all the way. Just how a friend refered me her, i will as well try to convince others of how good this place is. The service and the food will make you come again."}
{"text":"Well worth the extra cost related to the name of the Chef. Truffle fries are legit, my son said the sweet potato fries w/lemon infused powdered sugar are the best ever. Waitress was super knowledgeable & helpful for us. Oh yeah, the best Onion Rings ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ryan is the GOAT of all waiters! Best service I've experienced in the past 3 years of coming here, and at any restaurant for that matter. Brandon did a  stellar job as well. Outstanding service. 10/10 will be back."}
{"text":"I got the Farmhouse burger sans cheese and it was perfectly cooked and delicious! The fries were excellent as far as steak fries go even though they're not my favorite. The service really was excellent also! The waitress was very attentive! The only negative is the line to wait is right next to the beautiful fire display - I totally don't mind waiting but it feels like you are waiting in the steaming hot kitchen!  (no pun intended!)"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty and the burgers combinations makes you want to try them all! There's a bit of a waiting time but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place was amazing.  The service was awesome.  Waiter was super attentive and very courteous.  Food was delicious and perfectly cooked.  My kids loved it. The picky eater said it was the best burger they ever had."}
{"text":"After watching the Bruno Mars concert, the wife and I headed back towards our hotel and stumbled on this gem of a restaurant inside the PH. It was about 11pm and didn't expect to wait as long as we did. I should have known better, this was Vegas! We stood in line for about 45 minutes before we got seated. Took off one star for this experience. They have a dedicated line for couples and trios; larger parties skip the line and head straight to the hostess for seating. Why penalize the smaller parties. When we got to the front of the line, we counted three parties of six that were seated before us. How about clearing one or two couples in between seatings for the larger parties to make it equitable?  We got seated and proceeded to order. I went with the cheeseburger with bacon and egg and the wife went with the one with arugula. And some fries. In about 5 minutes, a runner came with a plate of tritip nachos. We didn't touch it and waited for our waiter. Asked him what it was and he immediately realized it was wrong. To our surprise, he took the plate away. Why didn't he just leave it? It's not like he could have served it to another party? He came back a minute later and offered it to us no charge. It was excellente! Found out later that it was intended for the trio of drunk girls next to us, to which we had some good conversation.  The burgers came out, and it was perfectly cooked. Medium as we ordered. These burgers were legit, the bun was great and the fixins were perfect. Great great burger. Bacon was thick and crispy and the egg yolk made a de facto sauce for the beef. Wish I came back. And surprisingly didn't feel too gross after. Fries - just ok. I've tasted some awesome fries and this here is lacking. (my baseline for great fries? Lazy Dog)  Legit burger!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I was in Vegas back in September. This was the best burger I have ever had. I am glad I didn't order fries because that Made me appreciate the taste of the burger even more! I had the ultimate cheeseburger with bacon. I can't wait to go back when I am in town!"}
{"text":"Burgers here are delicious! Fries are amazing! Also had their shakes which were just has delicious. We had to wait about 40 minutes for two, but according to people in the area that's normal.   Staff was very friendly and attentive. We were sat at the counter. Stools were cushiony and comfortable. The counter wasn't very romantic, but there were tables further in that seemed more romantic. They have a wall that appeared to have a gas fire going on which was really cute.  Staff was great. I was hoping to get a surprise appearance from the man himself, but maybe next time haha."}
{"text":"Vegetarian impossible burger is trash. Paid almost as much for the lobster burger and was definitely not worth it at all. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger. It came with avocado, grilled jalape√±o, cheese, grilled tomatoes and somehow it still didn't manage to taste good. No flavor at all and, it was super dry even though I got it medium rare. Probably one of the worst veggie burgers I've ever had. Tilt in Oregon still the best one I've had. They had truffle fries which were really freaking good I just wish the rest of the dish was just as good. Our sever was awesome too! He even brought us extra sauce. Don't think I'll be coming back for more though. :( l really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Waited in line 40 mind just to find multiple empty tables inside... service was so slow! Burger was good but not life changing. Was not told about the specials and they were probably better than what I got... what a let down...."}
{"text":"Great food, very nice atmosphere!!! I was super high but didn't feel out of place still.. the only downside is the line is ridiculous and Silver 7 members can cut to the front of the line the so the person just wanting a burger who is not staying at Planet Hollywood can end of waiting quite awhile.. ours was around 1 hour 20 minutes..  But if we can wait it's well worth the food they give you l!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, perfect simple burgers. The bun and the patty are the stars, as they should be. Our server, Alex, really made the meal enjoyable too. Good people, great food, didn't have to wait more than ten minutes for a table because we beat the 1130am lunch rush."}
{"text":"This place lived up to it's name! Everything was amazing, delicious and best burgers we've had. The Ahi Tuna sliders were my favorite, very fresh and flavorful. We also ordered the Hells Kitchen and 2 others (forgot the name) and they were perfect. Got the reg truffle parm fries and sweet potato, but the sweet potatoes were our favorite. Highly recommend the Ahi Tuna sliders, Hell's Kitchen burger and Sweet Potato parmesan fries."}
{"text":"I have tried other GR restaurants and have been pleased in the past. The best time seems to be Saturday between 2-4. Parties of 3 or more can check in with the hostess but 2 or less must stand in the line. On Friday and Saturday nights, this is a very long line. My food was good but I was not about to stand in line for 60 minutes plus.   I chose the patriot burger which is a turkey burger with cheese, a spicy mayo, and potato sticks. It was crunchy and very flavorful. I paired this burger with the truffle fries which were terrific."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staff rocks . Sosa was very nice and sincere he made us feel very welcome even though we could see him running around like crazy from behind the counter. I will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had in my life. My friend recommended me this place and I didn't understand what all the hype was about. As we walked into Planet Hollywood there was a line (an hour wait). We put our names down and walked around for a while. Once seated we looked through the menu and I eyed the Hell's Kitchen burger. My friends all opted for different burgers and we ordered some truffle fries for the table. My burger was cooked to perfect and the cheese was perfect too. Something about the sesame bun just made it even better. Our table ate the fries so fast, so I'll tell you now...its a must!!! This place won't disappoint you with its good service, clean environment and amazing food."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and fantastic burgers!  The decor and flames are great too!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ever had (and I live in NYC). I shared the Hell's Kitchen and Blue Burgers with my mom. Both had so many layers of flavor all on a well seasoned burger. We got it well done, yet it wasn't crunchy and burnt! The steak fries weren't my favorite, I prefer slimmer cut fries, but over all they were ok. My sister got a hot dog and it was literally a foot long. She ate half and still had plenty left."}
{"text":"As some one else said, if you only have 2 people in your party be prepared to wait in a long line.  Other than the wait everything else was fine. I had the Hells Kitchen Burger, the meat was very tender and tasty but honestly it wasn't anything special. This place is one of those places you just have to try once. I would come back here but probably not any time soon."}
{"text":"Where a burger and fries feels like fine dining!  The chipotle ketchup makes an otherwise average French fry into a taste explosion!  I recommend going off menu for the delicious anniversary burger. Medium rare and it's a party in your mouth!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Gordon's work, there's only one word to describe this place. Perfection. From the staff to the food, its exactly what you'd think it would be like. Everything was on point."}
{"text":"Got there just before opening and seated right away. Wife wanted to try the Foie Burger but our waiter, Jaime pointed out that burger will be phased out next update on the menu and suggested the Farmhouse Burger. I ordered the Backyard Burger and Truffle Parmesan Fries with Diet Pepsi. Wife wanted GF so Jaime suggest lettuce wrap as an option. She complimented the Burger with coffee. Both burgers came out perfectly cooked and very tasty. Jaime and his assistant, Don kept my Diet Pepsi and my wife's coffee replaced without being ask. That shows me that they pay attention to their customer's needs and aware of their responsibilities. Definitely be back next time visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"The farmhouse burger is DELICIOUS! The brown butter shake is AMAZING! The ultimate burger was good - but a little strong on the cheese. Onion rings were crispy and a good size; Parmesan truffle fries were also good - although I wasn't a fan of the truffle mayo dip it came with, but my boyfriend really liked it."}
{"text":"For the price, the long lines and all the Hoopla around Ramsey, I'd expect the burgers to be phenomenal. They were decent, but nothing that justifies all the above. I give it 2 stars because about a year ago, I ordered the fish and chips dish (which I believe is no longer on the menu - and thank god for that!) and what I got was appalling. That fish was so greasy, I literally had a POOL of grease on my plate. When picked up there was grease dripping from the fish. I made the mistake of taking a bite and had a real gag reflex. Yes it was THAT BAD. It felt like I got a big tablespoonful of oil in my mouth. I couldn't even swallow it. I had to spit it out into my napkin. For someone who was seen so often yelling at other restaurant owners about greasy fish and chips (on Kitchen Nightmares), the guy should go taste the version his own establishment serves. I think it takes special talent to get the batter that full of grease.  Perhaps it was a fluke, but a dish like that should never leave the kitchen at ANY restaurant. Or maybe that's why the dish is no longer on the menu...?  We were 4 people at our table and nobody really liked their food very much. All other dishes ordered that day got very mediocre responses from our table. Anyway, we never went back after that."}
{"text":"Spent our son's 21st Birthday here at Gordon Ramsay Burger at this has been his request forever!  Was Weds after Christmas. Wait wasn't bad. We had a party of 7 so we got to put our name in with the hostess and not wait in line and was called in an hour.   Was busy but the staff was very attentive!  Questions answered. Recommendations made.   Ordered apps that were WOW. Recommend all of the selections we made. Hummus, Kettle Chip Nachos, and Fries. You will not be sorry.   The burgers were probably the best burgers we've ever had. Between Turkey Burgers, Backyard Cheeseburgers, even the spicy burger (name escapes me) they were perfection. The Hot Dog was the biggest hot dog ever and was scrumptious!  We also ordered fries, truffle fries, and sweet potato fries. O M G!!!  We had no room for dessert which was sad but we will definitely be back!!  Plan on special occasions though because the bill can get hefty.   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Now this is a good burger...yess there are others . But after you wait 20 mins online it tastes so so much better. Out of the 40 burger we have tried in the past 2 years. This is in the top 5. But also top price.  Enjoy .!!!"}
{"text":"Id like to start off by saying im super infatuated by ramsay. Ive been wanting to try his steakhouse for the longest tine, but we wanted to try out the affordable option first....ramsay burger. Because of my infatuation, i had HIGH expectations.  We waited in a 20 minute line. And i was getting nice and toasty by the front glass where the fire display was.  While youre in line, theres a touch screen menu you can scroll at. Pretty economical. There are tvs around, if you wanted to catch a game.   We sat infront of the cooking line. It was amazing to see how efficient everyone was working and how fast food was getting expedited without losing quality.  We both werent super hungry, after eating all day. So we split a burger and app  We ordered the pork special. Pork burger wrapped in bacon for 18$ as recommended by our waiter, his favorite burger. I trusted him....and wish i went with my own intuition. It was good, dont get me wrong. But i felt i would have liked another burger much more.  Mushroom poutine: ive never had poutine and ive always seem ramsay go around the world poutine-ing this and that. So i was excited to try it out. I actually like it better than the burger. Definitely my favorite and most memorable. I went there sunday, and im sorry to say i cant remember the pork. And i love pork. Every single component in the poutine had its own tune. After awhile i started to disect it and try everything on its own(im such a brat foodie like that) and i wasnt disappointed. I could taste all of the ingredients put in. So much love into that poutine! And im sure it was prepped and reheated. Lol  I will definitely return and choose my own burger to my liking. And go for the poutine again. I wish i ordered another one to take home!  I cant wait to try the steakhouse next!"}
{"text":"This burger was hands down the best burger I've had. The price was reasonable and it's a good amount of food. I had the backyard burger and fries. The fries were enough to share with someone else. I gave it 4 stars only because we were waiting for our food and no one came to check in on us or give us any updates until we basically got our food."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hells' Kitchen burger and the truffle Parmesan fries. I really do like my burger. I gave it a 5 stars. The fries is just ok. Wish they cut the fires thinner and had less Parmesan to make it more crunchy  and less salty.  The service is pretty nice with friendly attitude and the restaurant is pretty nice and clean."}
{"text":"I only give four stars because of the service and cost overall. The price of the burgers at nearly $20 without any sides isn't worth making multiple trips here but, it was fun to say we tried it and visited one of Gordon Ramseys restaurants. The meat itself was delicious and cooked to perfection! I just can't justify spending nearly $100 with tip for three burgers, one order of french fries and onion rings. The onion rings were the best I've ever had! As much as I wanted to try a refreshing alcoholic beverage being on budget I couldn't do it but, I would love to return for some onion rings and a cocktail! Very loud busy environment but, fun to try with the family. I followed the tips here on Yelp and it did help to not get confused and wait in line as this is only for parties of two."}
{"text":"BEST Burger I've ever had! Must try in Vegas. Had the sweet potato fries and were delicious as well. Service was on point. The only set back was a long line to get seated, But definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"One of the best Chicken Wings we've tried, and of course those Burgers are incredible, service was great, the line to get there was pretty long, waited about 45 minutes to get seated, but this is Vegas! If you are traveling to Vegas and looking for a great burger spot, then this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Was here a few years ago while attending a Britney concert and apparently this place has been re branded a bit? I couldn't really tell but nevertheless the food is still amazing!!! Before my flight I got here shortly after they opened and was offered a nice table for one. The service was very slow to start but after my order was taken, things definitely improved. I started with a glass of prosecco and settled on the Hell's Kitchen burger medium rare. The burger was absolutely delicious and the meat almost melted in my mouth. I'm pretty sure I scarfed down my burger so quickly and with so much pleasure that people at an adjacent table asked me which burger I was eating haha. The jalape√±o peppers and aioli combined with the avocado and toasted tomatoes made for quite a delicious combination. I normally only eat half of my burger buns but with this one, I didn't leave a single crumb of bread left. 2 glasses of bubbly and this burger definitely made me a happy camper on the flight."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best burger I have ever had.   The bun is perfect, the meat is perfect..and OMG how about those sweet potato fries with powdered sugar?!? DELICIOUS!  Probably the best french fry combo ever. I will make burger a stop on every trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to visit a Gordon Ramsay establishment and I must say I wasn't too disappointed. I'll admit I thought this place could be gimmicky but after a 40 minute wait in line plus an additional 30 minute wait for my food I was not disappointed! Got a counter seat looking into the chaotic kitchen. They were very busy (of course) but when I finally got my first item, the Creme Brulee Shake, I happily enjoyed sipping it! It was a very good shake as I could taste the Creme Brulee on the top but to be honest the actual chocolate shake underneath it tasted just like any other chocolate shake anywhere else. Next was the UK Burger which was very juicy. Juicy as in every bite I took of that meat patty was dripping of meat juice, not oil! What made it unique was they had some sort of sweet jam spread on it which balanced out well with the cheese. And finally the winner of the meal was the amazing Parmesan Truffle Fries! Now if you don't order this you'll be missing out, these fries are delicious but it is that truffle sauce that just blows it out of the water! Each time I dipped a frie into that sauce and took a bite I felt like I was melting into a sea of buttery truffle goodness. Overall I enjoyed the experience very much, I only wish the wait times weren't as long but hey it's a popular Gordon Ramsay establishment! Great things are worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"Best lobster and shrimp burger I've eaten, Farmhouse burger were also delicious.  Burgers were juicy, loads of flavor! Onion rings and truffle fries were insanely addictive.  Wait time for burgers took awhile, definitely worth the wait if you are seated along the chef's table. Time flies by faster watching the line cooks and food prep."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Vegas, I come here! Gordon Ramsay really nails the perfect spicy  burger  and Blue Moon combo. Great place, will be back!"}
{"text":"Wife ordered the Kale salad and said it was a 5/5. I had the backyard burger. It was maybe a 3 or 4/5. Fairly costly for a burger and salad. Place was packed so obviously Gordon is happy! I asked to speak to him right away to discuss this mediocrity!. Anyway will say not bad!"}
{"text":"As the vegetarian at the table I ordered the poutine and an Oreo Creme br√ªl√©e milkshake. I liked the milkshake but sent the fries back because they looked and tasted gross. There were no cheese curds, the dish was warm not hot, and the gravy was thick and looked like...unappetizing.   Four stars because this IS a burger place and all the meat eaters at the table loved their burgers!"}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE!!! Even though it's always packed with people, they still manage to provide an efficient and fast service. Their burgers are AMAZING! Best burger I've ever had hands down."}
{"text":"I love coming to Vegas; checking out new places to eat so I couldn't pass Gordon Ramsay Burger. I came on a Thursday evening around 6pm; there was no wait time in line and grabbed a seat at the bar. I was greeted by Bianca V. who suggested the backyard burger. Everything looked great! The burger was delicious and super juicy, for the price its definitely the quality you pay for! Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"We ordered the best and largest cocktail shrimp I've ever had.  I dislike horseradish and this was the best horseradish I've ever had or will have.   I followed up with a corned beef sandwich with a Moscow mule.  They were both very yummy and would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"The food was okay. But our server TAMMY was HORRIBLE. She never acknowledge us. But she was more focused on the other costumers. She had a whole conversation with them until we finished our dinner. That was a disappointment."}
{"text":"We love their Foie burger and Farmhouse burgers. It's so good. Their shakes aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Everything has been thought through and works like a well oiled machine. Exotic ingredients like duck bacon bring up the price point. All the food was cooked very well but the flavor profiles didn't WOW me. Skip the mushroom poutine and get the chicken saltimbocca sliders."}
{"text":"Craving a burger in Vegas?  Look no further because this might be one of the best burgers in town.    Came here with a group of friends after driving in from LA. Got to the restaurant at 4pm and was seated immediately. When you first look at the menu you might think the burgers are pricey, but each burger comes with a considerable amount of beef.  I ordered the Forest Burger for myself and our table got the Parmesan truffle fries and sweet potato fries to share.  The Forest Burger comes with mushrooms, tremor cheese, arugula, and duck bacon.  This is my definition of a gourmet burger! The combination of all the ingredients was perfect; no item dominated the other.  If you aren't super hungry, sharing a burger is definitely reasonable, but be sure to ask for a knife to split the burger.  The Parmesan truffle fries are a MUST.  They might have changed up the way they serve this because the first time I ate here (maybe a year ago) it came with shoestring French fries, melted parmesan cheese, and truffles on top. My most recent trip, they came out with thicker pieces of fries, truffles, and shredded Parmesan.  Both times the fries were phenomenal and full of flavor.  Make sure to dip your fries in the garlic aioli sauce that comes on the side, you will thank me later."}
{"text":"were delicious. The wait was a little long but it was definitely worth it. I definitely recommend this place to start the day off."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here. The burgers are SO good! They are totally worth going to the strip for. The first time we went, we ordered a bunch of items to try and we were too full to enjoy our burgers. So this time we only ordered burgers. We REALLY enjoyed the burgers. Juicy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Visited restaurant expecting a great dining experienced butafter waiting a long time after ordering, my backyard burger needed seasoning ( the burger patty could have used salt and pepper).  Conversely, the french fries were too salty and were too crisp ( on the border of burnt). This \"gourmet\" burger and fries are over-rated and way overpriced. Plain old ketchup would have been more appropriate and less salty that the curry and chipotle mixed ketchup preparations they served with the french fries. I had to beg the waiter to come and provide a refill of my beverage...The place was a clip joint!  In and Out with its mass produced burgers and fries are much better prepared and their staff are more courteous.  I was very disappointed with the food and the service, the place was also very noisy, you couldn't hear your dining partner across the table.  Nicole O:  Thank you for your note to me regarding the aforementioned review, the staff person was a shaven headed fellow working about 7:30pm - 9:00 pm on January 18th and he had the section near the register/order computer near the flame window and the booths.  He served the two-person tables.  He gestured rudely to me when I signaled that he come to our table for water, it seemed he was overwhelmed serving the two tables on the sides of ours.    Unfortunately, we will not be returning to Las Vegas for a good while. Truly, I appreciate your offer to return to your restaurant and give it a second chance. Thank you very much and best wishes."}
{"text":"Gordon ramsay is fucking brilliant. Enough said. There was a little bit of a wait when we went, but it was totally worth it. Got the Bleu cheeseburger and my friend got the hells kitchen burger. Along with some parmesan fries. Everything was absolutely delicious! Go if you're in town."}
{"text":"We got burgers & fries. I got the backyard burger cut in half, I forget what my bf got but it is pictured below, but we shared the Parmesan truffle fries. Everything was excellent quality cooked to perfection. It's cool to be able to say I ate at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant but it's not really something I'll keep going back for. My boyfriend raves about it tho so our opinions vary. We both agree the French fries were bomb!  Waited in line to eat for about 45min. Ambiance was romantic & dimly lit. Fancy burgers in Vegas but I think I'll just let them stay in Vegas. I'm happy with my in&out burger any day. Lol."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for my 30th birthday and this was on our list of places to check out. We ordered the nachos which I was really disappointed in. The toppings were cold but the flavor was there. Our burgers were one of the best things I have ever tasted in my entire life!! I really wish they would build one here in Chicago. The burger was juicy without being soggy and the bun was as grilled to perfection. The truffle fries with the aioli were to die for! We can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. The size of burger patty is on the small size relative to price and other burger places. 2 out of 3 at our table were over cooked. Service was fine but hurried then slow. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Best esxperience ever. It started out with amazing host service, continued with an amazing waitress who really stayed on top of things and then the food. Had a burger, medium rare to oerfection! Last but not least the desserts, sticky pudding and chocolate trifle. Didn't think that there would be a restaurant that actually can be that way. Any time again"}
{"text":"First of all, I HATE the wait process for this restaurant. If you are a party of three or more, you can submit your name and phone number and be called back. However, if you are only a two top, you have to wait behind some rope and get called in one table at a time. I'm sure this is so a crowd develops and sparks interest but it's really annoying to feel trapped in this line. The wait time we were quoted was way off...and not in our favor. There's nowhere to sit. You can't explore the casino while you're waiting. You have to just stand in the line at their mercy. It would be better if you could at least make an Open Table reservation and the overflow had to wait outside to attract a crowd but this line is your only option. We waited at least 45 minutes at 9:00 on a weeknight!   Anyway...my other con to this restaurant is it kind of smells like a dirty rag at the entry way. Like that dirty bar smell that you sometimes encounter. I was SHOCKED by this two years ago when I first dined here and I was even more shocked that it still had this odor two years later. Very disappointing and it should be taken care of. Not up to Ramsay standards (that he prides himself in on TV) and his name is attached to this place.   It is VERY loud in this establishment. It's totally open to the casino at the front and back of the restaurant so you have restaurant noise, casino noise, bar noise, television noise, music...on this particular day I had a migraine so I was really overstimulated. If you want ambiance and a private conversation...this is not the place for you!   Our server was excellent. He noticed I wasn't feeling well. He sympathized with my migraine and even offered me Advil. He stooped down to our table to talk and take our order and I told him how much I valued his personality after our long day (we just returned from a 12 hour excursion). He was absolutely the star of this visit! He told us the burgers were running long and he would bring us our fries first. He was just so kind, attentive, efficient and great at his job. This establishment is lucky to have him and there should be more servers like him out there!   They don't have Heinz ketchup here. Only homemade ketchup. For me, this was a major flaw. I just don't like the homemade ketchup. It doesn't taste anything like the flavor I enjoy from Heinz. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was ok. It wasn't particularly flavorful which is surprising  considering how much stuff is on it (jalape√±o, roasted tomato, avocado...) My mom got the backyard burger which she said was delicious. We split fries. If I was feeling better I would say we definitely could have gotten away with an order of fries per person. I love french fries and the orders aren't THAT big. If you love fries and don't like to share them...go with one order per person.   I wanted to love this place more than I do. My migraine, I'm sure contributed somewhat. They need to figure out that smell...and get some regular ketchup for those of us that prefer it. Stop forcing the homemade stuff on us! And please make Open Table available!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot, based on the very good reviews of this location and previously great experiences with Gordon Ramsay establishments. I was quite disappointed. I ordered my burger medium, which should have some pink remaining. It came out quite well done. I ordered and Old Fashioned and they muddled a cherry and put a quarter of an orange in it. I know this is not a cocktail bar, but an Old Fashioned is probably the most basic cocktail and at $16 each, I would expect them to get it right. I would expect Gordon would not be happy with the product they are delivering in his name. Consistency and accuracy are his hallmarks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch having dined at both Steak & Fish and Chips. The standards here are no different. Everything is top notch from the table setting, to the decor, to the food. I ordered the hog burger and almost contemplated cutting it in half since it was so big. Quite delicious. I also ordered a side of fries. So damn good! Service was fast and friendly, the only negative I saw was wait staff appears to stand around a lot in the center of the room. I do not care for having the feeling that I am being stared at. Its just a bit awkward for me. Otherwise I highly recommend Burger and cant wait to go back and try something else from the menu. Its pricey but I feel the food was really worth what you pay for."}
{"text":"Fan-freaking-tastic. One of the best burgers I've ever had, and it was honestly not as pricey as I thought it would be. There's a reason his restaurants have earned him 16 Michelin stars. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger, and if you're into spicy, this one packs some heat behind it's amazing flavor. I also sampled the truffle fries and the sweet potato fries, and it was tough to pick which one I liked more. The service was great, and the staff was amenable. There was a line out the door to get inside, but I think that was to be expected at a place like this."}
{"text":"** update ** - manager came by and apologized. Gave us discount. And they started telling tables about the food wait time. So ... gotta give credit where do. Fwiw - food was hot and delicious when it arrived. Subpar experience overall tho  Writing this from our table. 30 minutes into sitting here. No food.   Waitress just said burgers take 25 minutes. Not for tables around us. And not mentioned on the menu. Just ours. So that's great.   The line out front is a lie btw. They have Plenty of space, just want you to think it's great. There are multiple empty tables.   Gordon - they are shitting on your brand mate. Step it up."}
{"text":"Unfortunately our experience was not a good one. We asked when we first were seated how long we should expect to be waiting for our food, because we are on a time crunch. The waitress said it takes about 25 minutes to have our burgers come out. We ordered, got our drinks and even got a refill on our drinks. Then almost 40 minutes later we are told by our waitress that our food will be right out. Guess what? Our food never showed up. The manager on duty, Zach, came over and was apologetic and helpful. He found out that our ticket wasn't ever put in. That is a damn shame. Zach then took our order and told us it would be out in a few minutes and on the house. He kept to his word, and our food came out within 5-7 minutes. The waitress came up to us and apologized and stated it was her fault and not the kitchen's. I appreciate her being forthcoming and all, but that didn't help that we were now running late because of this mess and still had not eaten lunch! I thought things were looking up, but then when our food came out my burger was f*cking well done!! I asked for medium. -- So to start out our waitress forgot to put our order in, then the kitchen messes up my order, and we are waiting over an hour. I didn't even finish the whole burger. The fries were over done;almost as if they had been sitting under a warmer for a period of time. So incredibly unimpressed."}
{"text":"Starting from the beginning,   we waited maybe 15 minutes to be seated.  1STAR seating was nice and comfortable  2 STAR waitress fast, attentive, and happy to answer the wife's 1,000 questions with a smile.  3 STAR Additional wait staff did not allow our drinks to get low  4 STAR FOOD WAS AMAZING  5 STAR  This place was more then we expected. We waited forever to try this place. My wife went outside her comfort zone and surprisingly wasn't disappointed. She has very picky taste and to please her is a challenge and this place did it with ease.   We will be back and we will spread the word to our friends and family in TX!!!"}
{"text":"+ THE FOOD This is the best burger I've ever had!! It was so good that we came back again during our short trip to Vegas before we left. The first burger I tried was the Hell's Kitchen burger. This was absolutely perfect since it had nice spicy flavors to it and huge portions of avocados. The burger was extremely juicy- so much that I spilled it all over myself. The flavors were perfect- not too salty but still good enough to keep you wanting for more. The second burger I had was the Farmhouse Burger. While this one wasn't as the first burger I tried, it was still pretty good. A lot of the flavor came from the egg only. The truffle fries were amazing. There was a lot of truffle flavor to it but the best part came from the dipping sauces! There is a garlic aiola type of sauce and a sweeter ketchup, which might be curry ketchup. Definitely would pay a visit whenever I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Burgers were awesome! No words for it. Especially the creme brulee shake! We were so full, but the food didnt stop us from having more. It was that good"}
{"text":"It's a simple pub food type menu.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  Overall we were happy and will be back."}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas my whole life and I don't think I've ever been to a celebrity chef owned restaurant yet. Well, there's a first time for everything.   I'll make this short and sweet: this place is kind of overrated. $15 to eat a burger (price of fries not included) in front of a giant portrait of Gordon Ramsay. I had the Crown Burger which is just a fancier version of the DGB from Red Robin. Tastes exactly the same. We waited an eternity for our burgers to come out: the guys who were seated much after us got their food at the same time we did. Our fries were cold and stale. Only thing I liked about the meal was the dipping sauce for the fries. I was also pretty impressed with presentation, but presentation can't fix mediocre food."}
{"text":"The burger was probably the best burger I've ever had. The fries were nicely spiced and perfectly crisp. The desert.... oh the desert....the chocolate caramel tart was so delicious we discussed the desire to lick the plate"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and I can say each time I have been satisfied some times were more and other times were less.   the first time was the best, it was amazing, service was on top of everything and the meal was incredible. I remember this marshmallow dipping sauce and it was amazing.   the 2nd time i got the jalapeno poppers (not on the menu anymore), burger and my date got a hot dog, we both left so satisfied and excited.   this last time the menu has been changed, they dont have a lot of things they had before which is kind of sad. I loved the jalapeno poppers and they are gone. I enjoyed the hot dogs and there are only 2 now.   I ordered the anniversary burger which was nice and the meat was flavorful, they only had a veggie option that was mushroom and my friend is allergic to port mushrooms.   Everything was good but just lacked that something special the 1st 2 times provided us.   This  last time was for my birthday and it was very nice but I wish i would have stopped after the 1st or 2nd time because the 3rd time was a bit of a let down. I will be back again hope they bring back some of the things i enjoyed before."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries turned out terrible because they covered them in powdered sugar. The food took an exceptionally long time to make for two burgers, but the burgers themselves were very good. I had the Portobello burger. Our waiter was great :) too pricey for Burgers and fries though."}
{"text":"Best burger in the country.  Taste, quality, pricing, location.  It's a reason I bring friends to Vegas"}
{"text":"In my opinion the restaurant is overrated. I was there yesterday and unfortunately I am very disappointed. I was always have very good opinion about Gordon's restaurant, but the reality was different. I ordered Lobster&Schrimp burger and Hell's Kitchen one, also the Trufle fries. The fries was so salty it wasn't tasty and for Lobster burger I also had higher hopes. The Hell's Kitchen burger was very good and I can recommend it at least.   Also the service was very bad poor. For sure it isn't good memory."}
{"text":"Wow, I was expecting to be let down or disappointed at yet another celebrity restaurant just using the name of the chef to sell its product.   This was clearly one of the best hamburger places that I have been too. I am more into a \"blue collar\" type of hamburger experience with traditional toppings and lots of beefy flavor. NOTE: so being from the Carolina's I love the Carolina-style hamburger but 1) I wouldn't even try getting this out of the Carolina's and 2) I wouldn't get a upscale Carolina-style hamburger (would be a oxy-moron concept).  The service and all the food was very pleasant and professional. My wife and I really enjoyed out lunch here. Highly recommend...  we almost went to Heart Attack grill but so glad we went here instead.   What we had:  Farmhouse¬†Burger : dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon, fried egg Beer¬†Battered¬†Onion¬†Rings parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip Hells'¬†Kitchen¬†Burger: asadero cheese, jalape√±os, avocado,roasted tomatoes, jalape√±o a√Øoli Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake: BrownButter ice cream, pecan shortbread  crumble  Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e Shake: chocolate or oreo milkshake with a cr√®me br√ªl√©e top"}
{"text":"The burger was so delicious! They had unique toppings,  simple but good combinations.  The burger was very flavorful and the service was friendly and fast.   I like the fact that the server let us know that it might take a while for the burger to come so we would be prepared to wait.  It turned out that it didn't take as long so that was a pleasant surprise.  My favorite item on the menu would be the onion rings!!  They tasted amazing and had a good crunchy texture.   They also had a good drink menu with good cocktails.  Overall this is definitely a place I will be back to whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"This is between 3-4 stars. I have eaten here before and experienced much better than service/ food. We waited in line for a party of two for half an hour. Then it took another half hour to get our food.  The burger this time around just didn't cut it for me. Truffle fries were OK. Sweet potato fries are always good. Can't go wrong with those. Fairly priced for a burger spot in Vegas, especially when a celebrity chefs name is on the joint. Props to them for keeping the pricing decent."}
{"text":"My husband and I really wanted to try Burger and we were not disappointed. We didn't wait but 5 minutes to be seated at the bar. The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly! Highly recommend give truffle fries, they are a large enough portion to share between 2-3 people!"}
{"text":"BurGR quietly changed their name to Gordon Ramsay Burger.  There is virtually no change to the restaurant except all the GR branding is gone.  If your making a weekend visit, I recommend coming to the restaurant early or face a line.  I went during the week and I was immediately seated.  We ordered an Oreo cookie shake to start.  It was incredibly decadent.  The bottom was the normal Oreo shake, but the top is filled with Cr√®me Brulee and whipped cream! As for the burgers, they are delicious.  I tried the Blue Cheeseburger.  It had blue cheese, manchego cheese, figgy jam, arugula, cider vinegar reduction, and a spicy mayo.  The flavors really worked well on this burger.  I couldn't stop eating it.  I liked the sweet with the savory.  I've learned my mistake with the fries.  There's enough for 2 people to share, so only order one.    I really like the family of restaurants Gordon Ramsay has been putting out.  If you can, you should make it to his Fish and Chips north of Burger."}
{"text":"I was really excited about trying this place.  The wait was kinda long and after we was seated we had to wait a while for the food.  The burger I had was ok, and the truffle fries was just ok...nothing really spectacular."}
{"text":"Gotta hand it to Gordon, he lives up to the standards he demands of others!   The burgers are succulent (we had the hog burger which was incredibly tender) and all of the sides were delicious - truffle Fries, onion rings and sweet potato fries. Each came with their own yummy dips. Totally worth the wait!  The service was great! My one gripe was the brown butter shake that came highly recommended was just too intensely sweet to drink. Other than that great place and definitely a great Vegas spot to eat!"}
{"text":"Great service and food!! You have to try the oreo shake my first Gordon Ramsay restaurant and I loved it."}
{"text":"The burger was as good as advertised!  I had the hell's kitchen burger and truffle fries, and everything was excellent.  One order of truffle fries is large, so good for sharing."}
{"text":"Egg slut is way better. This place is Not worth the wait.  First it took us 30 min to get a table.  One we ordered it took 30 min to get the food.  The burger came out looking great but when I took my first bite there was no wow factor.  Just a plain unseasoned burger.  The bacon was the wow factor."}
{"text":"My buddy insisted we go here and was hesitant at first, as I'm not big on celebrity hyped restaurants.  Well I'm happy I went.  I can say that it was one of the best burgers I had. I ordered the farmhouse burger with side of yam fries.  My buddy ordered the special which was an sirloin burger and side of eer battered onion rings.  I did try his onion rings and though they were good, one was enough as didn't feel like deep fried battered that night , as it was very filling.  My burger ordered med-rare and was cooked perfectly.  Beers on tap are plentiful and actually pretty good priced starting at $7 (remember this is Vegas I paid at some places $13 for the same beers).  Service was awesome and constantly checking on us. Usually I am not a fan of burger places that charge around $14 for just a burger, with sides extra, but this is one place where I found it worth it.  Just be warned of you don't have reservations then it could be a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"For starters, we went with the Onion Rings. Nice flavors in the sauces that accompany them. The Burgers are all they're hyped up to be with service to match! I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. (I'd rate the \"hot\" factor as a 5/6 out of 10 for the jalape√±o factor.) The Forest Burger went over just as well. There are quite a few burger spots in Vegas. Make sure you put aside a couple of hours for Gordon Ramsay Burger."}
{"text":"Favorite burger place ever! Get the hell's kitchen if you can handle spice, you won't be disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"My friend had been here before and wanted to take me there. We had quite a wait. Our server was so friendly and that always makes for a nice experience. The burger was good. The beer battered onion rings and truffle fries-ABSOLUTELY delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here next time I'm in Vegas!! I had the curry burger, which was veryyy delicious! My boyfriend got the hog burger which was waaay tastier than mine but nonetheless I was very happy with my choice. Also great customer service!"}
{"text":"Waited in line 45 min. Then once we were seated waited another 10min before anyone came to our table. We had a weird thing happen when a second  waiter came up and said our waitress had gone home. We witnessed her the whole time waitressing other tables right next to us. Finally ordered our food and it took 45 min before we were served. Food was good but not worth the wait.  Gordon  Ramsey you need to work on service here."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try out Gordon Ramsay Burger. But we were disappointed. We ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, forest burger and chips and curry sauce. The burgers were good but not great. Fries were rock hard. We waited 30 mins before the food came out. I dont think Gordon would approve. With so many burger option in vegas, don't think we will come back."}
{"text":"Best burger, Best wings, Best drinks, a little bit of wait.  The food and the drinks all had unique flavors and were worth every penny. Everytime you eat or drink something, it has a few different flavors you experience from the first bite/sip, then while your chewing/drinking and then the aftertaste. I don't know how they do it but it's a spectacular feeling! Kind of like that scene from Ratatouille when he makes his friend eat a mixture of good cheese and nuts. See here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qtEjJuGo_U"}
{"text":"This place was the first place my wife and I went every time we went to Vegas.  In fact we would plan our trip so that we ended up in Vegas at lunch time just so we could go straight here after we checked into whatever hotel we checked into.  The burgers were great but the poppers were our favorite and basically the main reason we went.  They have discontinued the poppers so now we will have to find another place to call our favorite because this place no longer is.  The burgers are great but you can get a great burger anywhere.  What a shame"}
{"text":"Le nom ne refl√®te pas la dite notori√©t√© ... Dommage ! L √©tat des toilettes : no comment !?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm not huge into burgers I usually like more of a foodie scene but this was great!  We had a bit of a wait but the food was worth it.  Loved the fries with curry sauce and the Forest burger was delicious. Hell's Kitchen burger was really good too (could have had a bit more of a kick).  I loved all the British touches, being a Brit all all, with the decor and menu, super fun!"}
{"text":"No reservations. There is a line and you give your party size at the front. We waited in line for about 15 minutes and that was ok. I didn't mind waiting and we got in quicker than expected.  Food took a little long to arrive but it was worth every minute. We started with a cheddar ale soup and a Cesar salad. Both were absolutely amazing. Soup was hot, creamy and had perfect texture. I ordered the blue cheese burger and my husband ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. The blue cheese was of really good quality and the meat cooked exactly how I asked. The Hell's Kitchen burger was off the charts fantastic. Don't be intimidated by the heat! It's perfect. Just the right amount of kick and all the flavor! Finally, we had a chocolate shake. There's pudding on top of the shake! Pudding! Enough said!  I was beyond satisfied at Gordon Ramsay's Burger. I'm a big fan and think he's fantastic. This place lived up to my Ramsay expectations as far as cleanliness, quality and service. Please open one in LA!!"}
{"text":"Great burger and would recommend when you're looking for a nice juicy burger. It is the hotel and you need to walk around to get there. We were seated quickly but when we left around 7 there was a line and I had read they usually have lines. So go earlier if you can.   Service was just okay. But again, recommend if you're in the food for s burger! The sweet potatoes are also so tasty."}
{"text":"This is one of the few 1 star reviews I'll ever give and I didn't even go to Gordon Ramsay Burger. This review is of the reservation system they have set up there.   It all started with me calling them to make reservations about a month in advance for July 3rd. I wanted to reserve a dinner for my family of 15. Everything went fine until they emailed me. The email said that because we have a large group, it's a minimum of $95 a person and we have to pay an estimated down payment ahead of time. I thought they must be joking. How can you bill someone a meal BEFORE they even eat it? Probably the most absurd thing is that even though it's $95 a person, they sent me a list of set menus that had a couple of three course meals for $70-80 each. That means pay $1500 up front? That means that every person has to have a drink? Well, we have 5 children a couple of my family members that don't drink.  So when I tried to talk to the \"Sales Manager\" Heather, she just so happens to be on vacation for the week. As popular as the Gordon Ramsay name is, I can't believe this is how they function when someone tries to book a party ahead of time. There's no way I'm going to pay money ahead of time for food we haven't ate and I can't believe people actually would. Even though I expect great food and great service, it's a people's business and all it takes is one person to have a bad day to ruin our experience. How do you expect us to pay for that in advance?"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this  Went for lunch.  Quick seating if we sat at the bar.  What I like about Ramsays restaraunts is the menu shows the ingredients. I like knowing what makes my plate.  Had a bleu cheese burger, which was lovely, and truffle fries, which were fine.   I would recommend to anyone who is willing to eat a burger and fries on a 30 dollar budget"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant only one star because the expectations were so high for the best gourmet burgers ever.  Coming from the Midwest where we have the best beef in the world, I expected the \"gourmet\" to build on the perfect juicy, tasty burger (which even I know how to cook.). We were also very excited to see poutine on the menu, as my husband is from the birthplace of poutine (Montreal) and GR could only make it better, right?  Wrong on both accounts.  The patty in our burger, although cooked medium, was dry and tasteless.  Now a medium burger is pretty hard to dry out!  It was as if they took gourmet ideas and plopped them on a little bit bigger (being generous) McD's patty and put GR's name on it to make people think they were getting something g special!  The poutine was equally disappointing.  The gravy was a VERY strong pepper gravy (some people might like... for me a bit too strong.)  But the biggest SIN was to hardly put any curd chees on it at all!  That's the best part of poutine, and we were left fighting over the tiny, tiny morsels of chees sprinkled throughout.  Curd cheese is CURDS of cheese!!  Plus the reservation/call ahead/ you're screwed if your're only a party of 2 check-in system is wonky and ilexplained.    Bottom line... don't go!  GR would be embarrassed by these burgers!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Worth the hype, worth the wait.  The burger patty was cooked just right. It has an amazing taste and was juicy. Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Best burger ever is all I have to say. You have to get their shakes they are amazing also! The creme brulee oreo is my fave!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my husband. Got seated right away but service was very poor after that. I got the potato chip nachos. They were so salty I could barely eat them. My husband got a burger and loved it. It's annoying that there is no bathroom and you need to walk through the casino."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a Hell's Kitchen Burger with the truffle and Parmesan fries with a Belvedere mule. So damn good!"}
{"text":"Currently at the restaurant. Friday 3/9/18 only reason why I'm rating low because the food is above 30 minutes and not out yet. A table came after us and got the food before. The server is nice as well as the Hostess who walked us to the table."}
{"text":"Yumm! It was worth waiting in line for.  Great experience for our vacation.  Fun selection of burgers and they were cooked perfectly. Recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"When entering the casino at 9 o'clock on Tuesday the line looked daunting but after a 20-25 minute wait we were seated. The menu is filled with burgers, a couple salads, a few appetizers and some sides. Cone filled shaped sundae cups came out overflowing with truffle garlic fries but sad to say I didn't try them. I did however have the Farmhouse burger and found it to be cooked perfectly, with the bacon crisp and the yolk on the egg just right. My husband had the Hells Kitchen burger pictured below topped with green chiles and avocado slices. $36 for two burgers ? It's Vegas after all. Would I go there again, probably not because though everything was delicious I wasn't blown away. I would reserve for his Hells Kitchen Restaurant in advance though."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever eaten! My boyfriend and I went to Gordon Ramsay's Burger on a Friday night. We waited about 10 minutes in line to be seated. This restaurant pretty much always has a wait so I recommend coming early for lunch if you don't want to wait in line. Service was good and I like that they have a wide variety of burgers to choose from. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our burgers very much! He ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger with asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes and jalapeno aioli. I ordered the farmhouse burger with dubliner cheese, mangalitsa bacon and fried egg. We also enjoyed the truffle parmesan fries! On our last visit we got to sit at the bar next to the kitchen - if you are a true foodie and want an inside look I would recommend asking to sit there."}
{"text":"Wow, the burgers here are freakin good. One of the best I've had. Meat is so juicy and full of flavor. The burger also has a nice kick with the jalapeno peppers. YUM!!"}
{"text":"The wait is a bit long but my husband and I think that it's worth it. The burgers were delicious and the truffle fries.. yum! Tip: If you do go here, it's better to have a party of 2. For parties with 3+ people, the wait is a lot longer."}
{"text":"Short line to get seated and didn't take more than 10 minutes on a late Friday night... to be seated in the middle of the damn dining room, my fave spot for utmost comfort btw. I wish they would've asked what we preferred or gave options.   My hubs ordered the Hog Burger medium done and enjoyed it more than my Hell's Kitchen Burger. I thought mine was pretty bomb, good flavor balance. They really do medium to perfection!   Since everything's a la carte, we ordered truffle-Parmesan fries and some wings. Truffle n Parmesan fries were aromatic n wings were deboned n delicious; be sure to smear bleu cheese onto each bite.   Finished w a nicely plated blood orange creamsicle, homemade from scratch, that tasted really nice.... except I wasn't sure why it was so soft n melty.  Overall: Great upscale ambience, perfect gourmet burgers n spotless service. Iced teas kept coming before we even thought to ask and our waiter never failed to check on our alcohol situation. Solid place, so glad we tried!"}
{"text":"This is a great location with a wonderful upbeat menu.   There are multiple choices for burgers as one would expect as well. As many other main course selections.  The appitizers are a plenty and well worth the attention as Everthing has explosive tastes."}
{"text":"Oh boy the longest wait ever in the world! I guess that's to be expected from a celebrity chef restaurant.  I ordered the Patriot Burger, which was a turkey burger, smoked Gouda, spicy mayo, cherry compote(?) and crispy onions. DANG this burger was so good. I chose the turkey burger simply because it sounded healthier, but when I read all the dressings that came with it, it very quickly made my mouth water. And it did not disappoint. My friends ordered standard burgers like the kinds with eggs, avocado, or bacon. And they were upset. I mean, this is Gordon freaking Ramsay. You have a higher expectation!  But the Patriot Burger was amazingggg!   Because of the celebrity chef owner, the line here is long. You can put your name down and they'll text you when your table is ready. This basically means you have time to gamble in the casino, or shop around in the stores nearby.   Would I come back? Probably not, but if you find yourself dragged here get the Patriot Burger. It's the only one worth it on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm never down to wait more than 30 minutes for food, so if you're impatient like me then SKIP the long line and order burgers to-go.   Food-wise, the Hell's Kitchen burger definitely lives up to the name. I usually get the wheat bun along with a patty done medium well. The burger comes with huge pieces of avocado and jalape√±o aioli, which comes as a surprising (but tasty) kick. Everything was cooked to perfection and the burger itself just effortlessly melts in your mouth. However, I'm not a huge fan of their fries. Think thick-cut steak fries on the soggier side with no seasoning at all. Not even a pinch of salt or pepper - lacking some love, I'd say. Plus the curry ketchup was very much an acquired taste. The flavors just didn't mix well at all in my opinion. Skip the fries, but the Hell's Kitchen burger is a must."}
{"text":"This location you can save a few bucks compared to some other options in the area but if you're not careful can definitely blow up your wallet.  The burgers here really are top notch quality! Lamb burger was super juicy and moist! Just be prepared to fork over some cash.  The irish nachos were subpar, the cheese sauce is amazing but the pork had inedible chunks of fat on them."}
{"text":"Going in, I was a bit of a skeptic, having been burned by \"celebrity\" chefs in the past, but my \"anniversary special\" burger was unique and flavorful, while the onion rings were verifiably TDF!!   The staff were very friendly, always on time, and accurately split the checks for our large group. All the meals were on the table within about 2 minutes of one another.   We were able to get an \"arrive at\" reservation time and then it only took about 15 minutes longer to get seated...no small feat considering the size of our group (almost 30).   This was a great all-around experience....highly recommended."}
{"text":"Service was good.  And the nachos were delicious.  But we came here for burgers and fries, and those were a major letdown.  I think it comes down to fundamentals with a burger:  the preparation and arrangement of the components, the cooking of the burger, the presentation on the plate....those were all failures for 3 of the 4 dishes.  (One eater liked his Hells Kitchen burger).  Burgers were red-to-pink for medium-well!  And the pickles on one burger were all haphazardly centered in the middle so half the pickles had to be pulled off and the burger rearranged.  Minor quibble but we ARE talking about an $18 burger!  Bacon was soft and chewy on two burgers, and hard as a rock on another.  And the fries!  Just terrible.  Oversalted, and some strange ketchup/tabasco(?) combination, we left the fries alone.  Overall, very disappointed in the Brits' re-imagination of an American classic!"}
{"text":"Of course we had to come here to get something after seeing Gordon Ramsay killing the game on tv. I was trying to set realistic expectations for this place but it's really hard with a chef of this caliber in its name. For me, the burger was only alright. We got the forest burger and it was just too fancy for us. I guess sometimes simple is better, and this is definitely the case. The buns were really good and didn't look or taste like it came from a bag. The meat was well seasoned and cooked medium just like the way we liked it. Somehow the meat wasn't very juicy though. I wonder what the ratio of fat is in their patty...The part that threw me off was the cheese. In my opinion, the tremor cheese just doesn't go well with the burger. It tasted like goat cheese and I felt like it overpowered the burger. I was really surprised about the arugula though. It wasn't too bitter and actually went well with the burger. However, I still feel like normal green leaf lettuce would've been better. But I did really like the mushrooms which gave it a different change of texture. We also got the truffle fries and it was phenomenal. The truffle and cheese gave it a unique, creamy flavor that tasted best with the normal ketchup. Service here was great and our server was very attentive. To justify the price for just a burger I expected this to blow my mind away. This didn't happen today. If it wasn't for how good the fries were, I would've given this place 3 stars. I hope I just got the wrong burger and the others are actually very good. Probably wont be back for a second chance though."}
{"text":"While all of our burgers were exceptionally delicious, what really stood out on was the parmesan truffle fries. They are exquisite!   It was a lengthy wait to get in, close to an hour, but the food was worth waiting for, the staff were friendly, knowledgeable and knew the menu inside and out."}
{"text":"Came after reading a bunch of good reviews and was extremely disappointed. We arrived a little after midnight and the place was not busy. There were 3 girls at the to be seated booth. We stood there waited to be seated and not one addressed us and ask how many. We looked like idiots standing there until my girlfriend utter maybe we should just go somewhere else. It was then, one of the girls turned around and seated us. Our waiter was good but the lack of service from the beginning really sour the experience. I ordered the farm burger, truffle fries, and wings. Farm burger had no taste, wings was cold, and truffle fries taste old. Aside from our waiter, we would have given this a negative 2 stars. Not what we expected for a Ramsey restaurant."}
{"text":"Best burger you'll ever taste in your life. Awesome environment and service! There was about an hour wait but it was so worth it."}
{"text":"I make sure to eat here every time I am in Vegas. I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan so I may be biased but I think this restaurant is fabulous. It is so affordable and the burgers are to die for. Most recently I ordered the 'Patriot Burger' which was actually a turkey burger and it was amazing. I also really enjoy the 'Caribbean Dream' drink. Although I'm not positive what is in it, it is delicious.  Atmosphere and decor are different and fun. Good for families or date-night."}
{"text":"Decent ingredients, burger was undercooked, fries were great, server was attentive.  Restaurant is on the border of the casino, so the smell of cigarette smoke still permeates into the restaurant."}
{"text":"We started off with drinks of course, and the Truffle Parmesan Fries since they said it takes a half hour to get your burger (I don't know why it should take so long to cook a burger! Especially when Gordon's biggest grips on his tv show Kitchen Nightmares is the speed of service!) The fries were very good though! For the burger, I went with the Ultimate¬†Cheeseburger, and I had them add bacon to it, but when I received my burger there was n bacon added to it! So if you order something like that to your burger CHECK IT FIRST! All they did was give me an option of either having it on the side- ya right! Had them take that part off on the bill! They should have offered something more- oh well. So wasn't impressed there, but the burger and the bread was very good!  My wife went with the Forest¬†Burger with Duck Bacon, which worked real well! Maybe I should have had that one minus the mushrooms!"}
{"text":"The burger wasn't FAWKIN RAW. IT WAS DELICIOUS. It was really good and that is the point, it was quick too. Even with the restaurant seeming like it was full, our burgers still came quickly. They were hot too, and cooked the way we wanted them.  It's really good."}
{"text":"The foie burger and truffle parmesan fries are a match make in heaven. I finished everything with my Modelo. Pleasantly surprised because this is the first time I've come here and it surely won't be my last!"}
{"text":"I thought this burger was just ok. They have a variety of burger choices and toppings. I had just a regular bacon burger which was average. I wanted regular ketchup but they only had one that was homemade and in my opinion not good. Parmesan fries was cold and hard.   Save the extra money. This is just a high priced burger served at a celebrity restaurant."}
{"text":"Always a 5. I would recommend Burgr to everyone! Especially if you own a restaurant! This is how a restaurant should be run. First Class service is followed up by the best food you'll eat. This place is a must, but fair warning, go EARLY, if you 'pop' in after 6 looking for a table, you'll be waiting for a long time."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers!!!! Even better,  the wait staff was superior and the comfortable decor.  We'll worth the visit."}
{"text":"The wait was long for just 2 people took about 40 min and then burgers took another 30 min. The patty was a little dry and very plain. I'm not sure they seasoned their patties or not but the buns were good. We ordered chicken wing, 2 burgers, and truffle fries. Our total came out to be $70. Wouldn't come back again. Recommend going to other burger joint or go to Gordon's steakhouse over Gordon's burger. Portions were a good size because we had appetizers the burgers filled us up. We did not finish our truffle fries."}
{"text":"First time here and now I understand why there's always a line!    Food:  all of the burgers and dishes are well thought out and flavor execution is as good as it sounds on the menu.  Our favorites:  the chicken saltimbacco sliders are tasty.  Perfectly breaded, thin, fried chicken topped off with arugula salad that is dressed on a crispy toasted seasame brioche bun.  The onion rings were crispy and not oily, served with house made spicy ketchup and mayo. The mangalica pork burger wrapped in mangalica bacon and pulled pork is divine!  The forest burger is also amazing. All the flavors work well together and the meat temp came out exactly as ordered.  Service:  all the service staff was quick, friendly and attentive.  Our drinks were quickly refilled before empty.  Even though the restaurant was full, service was impeccable and food came up quickly.  I'm totally impressed with how well run this restaurant is and the food is deserving of the Gordon Ramsey brand.  Will be back to try some of the other burgers."}
{"text":"Went here on Thursday evening.... there was a long line but it moved quickly.... I tried the Blue Burger --excellent Really tender meat and great flavor great burger!  The onion rings -beer batter with grated  cheese... sides of ranch and ketchup Chipoltle ... unfortunately the onion rings were too salty and ranch also--like someone lost control of salt shaker !  The ketchup Chipolte was less salty  but still no good with onion rings still having sooo much salt! Service -I eat at bar was fine... people tending to eat their burger and leave .. quick turnover..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is nice, with modern decor and a beautiful fire display in the front as you enter. I was surprised by the food here, as my expectations were pretty high for this place given the name, but I was incredibly disappointed. There were 4 in our party and two ordered burgers. One was ordered as medium well, but it was medium (bright pink center throughout) at best. The second was ordered medium and it was closer to medium rare (bright red center).Our server only checked on us once right at the first bite, so we never had a chance to voice our complaint. She was very nice and did a great job otherwise.  The truffle fries were way over cooked.  Check out some of the other burger joints in this area as there are TONS and here you are really only paying for the name.    *Edit: I added a third star to my review as I was contacted by the management team in regards to my review. The individual who reached out has shown genuine concern for my experience and promised follow up will be made with staff to ensure this does not happen in the future.  I personally feel exceptional customer service is essential in this industry, so this was very meaningful to me. Ownership is essential and they seem to want to genuinely provide a great experience to their customers, including recognizing they made a mistake and ensuring they catch any that may occur quickly enough in the future so it can be resolved."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers! Gorgeous decor/ambience. Server was great! Want to come back again, and again and....."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the hype, but this place wasn't THAT good. It was a good burger but nothing special, if I'm honest. The staff was good, from the hostess to the waitress to the bussers. I'll probably be back, but I won't be expecting a meal I've become accustomed to from other GR establishments."}
{"text":"Best Damn burger and truffle fires I ever had in my life!!!! You won't be disappointed if you are your just hater and don't know quality....."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers!!!    but this review is based off of service and it sucks ( what was the waitress doing) I wish Ramsay came in and put two slices of bread on this waitress and ask her \"WHAT ARE YOU!?\" .....and I think you guys know the response to that, if not then just look it up.  There was a party of 2 that sat 15min after us and received their food way before us; we had to wait an additional 10min for our food to come out. What a bummer."}
{"text":"The review is for the Tandoori Chicken Burger only. It tasted overly salted and was inedible half way through. Really sad as I had high expectations for this place. The other burgers seem good though. Maybe I had an off one."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Gordon Ramsay's Burger restaurant and it was everything and more. The decor, the menus, the whole ambience was amazing. I was in a group of 7 people and they told us it would be an hour wait which was fine since we were on the casino already so we just gambled until we were notified through text message that our table was ready. We arrived and were told they were clearing off our table, okay cool but it literally took them 15 minutes to clear a table off which I felt like was a little bit long to wait after you told us our table was ready. Anyways, the food was great! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger because it had jalape√±os which i thought would be spicy but it really wasn't but good none the less. Our table also ordered the sweet potato fries and the truffle Parmesan fries. Both amazing!! The swear potato fries were just so damn good! Can't really figure out way but they were not your ordinary fries! And you can't go wrong with truffle! Those fries were amazing as well! Our experience was overall great! I'm docking a star because of the wait but everything else was top notch!"}
{"text":"Riktigt bra burgare, ganska dyrt s√• om det √§r v√§rt det √§r en bra fr√•ga men helheten med upplevelsen av restaurangen och en bra burgare √§r bra."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday night at around 9. The place was super busy and Poppin but it was worth the 40 minute wait. The service was fantastic and the servers are attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was semi casual and very clean.   The food: My girlfriend ordered the forest burger. She says it was amazing and the mushrooms were fresh and the patty was cooked to perfection.  I ordered the crown burger and the aioli was great with the meat. I added bacon and it was crispy and flavorful.  We both agreed that the buns were the best component as they were fluffy and had some good sesame seeds on top.   The truffle fries and aioli were the best things I've ever eaten. I would die for those fries.  The only negatives were the patties themselves as they were a tad underseasoned, but the ingredients and buns help with that.   Overall: if you like burgers and Gordon Ramsay, this place is worth the wait and the moderate pricing. However if the novelty of a celebrity chef isnt your shtick, you might not be too impressed"}
{"text":"Went here with a group and all enjoyed our burgers. But what really made the experience was Caleb who was assisting our server with drinks etc.  Before we could even finish our drinks,  he was already there with a refill and smile on his face. The whole time we were there, he was running around helping the whole restaurant. It was so refreshing to see someone who loved their job with a positive attitude!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after years of hearing about it and wanting too but never wanting to wait in the long line but my friends are diamond rewards members so we didn't have to wait in line last night!!! We started with the burnt ends poutine which was absolutely delicious!! I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which comes with roasted jalape√±os, roasted tomatoes, and avocado. I asked for my mine medium and it was perfectly cooked.  My friends both had the forest burger which comes with grilled mushroom and they both loved it.  Also had the truffle fries which were just okay (nothing special)  Our server was very attentive and kept checking on us.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"No exaggerations here. Top 3 burgers I've ever had and I've had quite a few. It was juicy and flavorful like a ribeye almost. I went around 2 so there was no wait and service was wonderful. Our waitress literally gave me a new glass of lemonade half way through my first. They have a weekly special that changes but I didn't try because I wanted a beef burger and it was pork. For my first time in Vegas this was a must have on my list and it didn't disappoint. I had the farm house. House cured bacon, egg, and dublinar cheese. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town. We also tried the truffle fries were excellent as well and big enough to share between 3. Sorry I didn't get a photo my friends attacked before I could act but the photos of my burger are more than you need to decide"}
{"text":"Dined in here the day after Christmas. Wait time was around half an hour to 40min. We ordered the truffled Parmesan fries, Hell's Kitchen burger and Hog burger. Price was reasonable. The Hell's Kitchen burger was ok but Hog burger was really good. It gave you different layers of flavors with burger patty, bacon, beef, brisket, and the fried onion layer offers a crispy texture. The fries were also very tasty and not oily at all. Recommend this place."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place and wanted to give it a try. Ordered Caesar salad and lamb burger. The salad was very salty. When I told the waiter that he said it must be the cheese(!?!?!). The lamb patty was very dry and again the burger was very salty. Food was a big flop here. And the wait was 30 min for the food to come to your table. I recommend to skip this place. Not worth your money and time."}
{"text":"Well...we waited 1.5 hours to eat here. It was edible. All I can really say about the flavor is that it lacks flavor. I gave it a three stars because the root beer was good. I got the parmesean fries and the ketchup that came with it was funky tasting. I hope Gordon Ramsey reads this, your burgers are not the greatest buddy, stick to British food and leave the American burger alone."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever eaten! Got the Blue Cheeseburger. Made all my foodie dreams come true. Parmesan Truffle fries were great too. Ambiance was great and wait staff were very accommodating. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsay... from his shows, books, and restaurants. This place did not disappointment. I'm a pescatarian and found the lobster/shrimp burger more than satisfying. The wait was very long... but it was expected. This place was more than exceptional."}
{"text":"Truffle fries are to die for!!! Pre drink with the pear wine sangira and you've reached bliss."}
{"text":"Sunday, March 4, 2018 @ 1:16am Bad experience!    The service was good.  BUT the food (burger, fries) were bland and cold.  Had to ask for salt and pepper to give them flavor.  Not worth the time and money.  Manager was equally cold and rude!"}
{"text":"Meh. Came here last night. I will say service was 5 stars. Wait took forever, they sat us next to the fire wall but we were way too hot and the staff reaccomdated our seating which made them get 5 stars in my book. Our waiter was helpful and really knew the menu. Reason for the lower ranking is that I had really high hopes for this place. Now I ate the entire burger because I was so hungry. The ketchup is home made and I was not a fan, it was spicy almost like a cocktail sauce, but just not good with their fries. Fries were overly seasoned. I preferred the regular ones over the truffle. The onion rings were bomb. The burger I had was good, but dry and I did not like the cheese on there, very stinky like goat. I prefer red robin over this place."}
{"text":"I am giving this four stars for the service. The food is not up to standard of the other Ramsey Gordon locations in our opinions.  It is good, but the sliders that we had were on the salty side, and the burgers that we had were not the best that we've ever had. I like the Gordon Ramsay pub burgers better.  The service however was first class, and everyone was more than welcoming."}
{"text":"Omg I ate the best Parmesan fries there! And my forest burger was delicious. Everyone liked it. I would definitely come back here when I'm next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Gordon Ramsay, just like me, this is the place. It's just Wow!!  Don't forget about a long long line tho. Awesome!  Two Thumbs up!!   Food: Good Price: Good Service: Good Parking: Good"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect but it was damn good, I'd say worth the price. When we went wait wasn't very long. Great atmosphere, bar seating as well as table."}
{"text":"First let me preface this by saying I'm not a burger person.  I probably only eat one or two a year but my husband, well it's his favorite food on earth.  The big thing with this place is timing.  If you go in off hours it's no problem.  During a regular dinner or lunch hour it's packed and there are lines out the door.    Since it was an off time, I can't say if the service is always this good but on that day it was perfect.  We sat down with our menus, had the server there in minutes to take our drink orders.  They have lots of appetizers and stuff on the menu but since I never eat a lot I opted to just eat the burger and fries.  Think maybe they make their own buns or source them from some bakery because they didn't come out of a package.  The burgers were juicy and just the right amount of toppings.  Fries seemed like they might have been double fried, crisp on the outside and moist and tender on the inside.    If you're a burger lover, don't miss this place, even though I'm not a fan of Gordon Ramsay"}
{"text":"Wow!! The best burger and fries I ever had I'm sitting here almost a year later reminiscing about my meal from here! Thinking to myself \" Gordon Ramsey can be as mean as he wants producing food like that\" I got the burger with the duck bacon and egg and it was amazing and the truffle fries are bomb too"}
{"text":"The food itself is 4 stars. Good burger, great onion rings, awesome brown butter shake. But man, I really don't think burgers for 2 should cost over $100. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here when visiting Vegas. It was an hour wait but worth it. They have great food, I had Hells Kitchen burger with their truffle fries. I remember it like it was yesterday. And not to mention good beer to go along with it. Try the Innus & Gunns with your food. We got seated at the bar near the kitchen. The sous chef in the kitchen talked to us and didn't make it feel like we were sitting right there but it was nice to see where all the action took place. Next time I'll want to sit by the nice fire."}
{"text":"2 stars for service. Place was empty. 3 ladies in the front were friendly. Seated quickly but then nothing. No server. No water. Nothing. We got up and left after 10 minutes waiting to order which is probably a good but overpriced burger. $15.00 and up with no sides from the menu only. As we left the gal said thanks for coming not remembering we had just walked in. Who knows if tbe food would. E good. We are now at PBR Rock Bar. Already better service. Hopefully the  food is good."}
{"text":"I was ready to rate this place a 1 until I ate my burger. I have to admit the burgers are good. That said, the weird wait system is ridiculous.  If you are a party of 2 you get to wait in a line and 3 or more you put in a reservation and get a text when your ready. So I waited in line for 30 mins even though they quoted 15 and the line was short. It goes REALLY slow. So I'm watching a bunch of larger parties getting seated before me.  When I complain about this to the overstaffed hostess stand, they explain that they have way more two top tables. This is a flat out LIE because they put many of them together to accommodate larger parties. Then after waiting a half hour, they break down a large table at the front with the sun blaring in to make four 2-top tables and offer it to us, after I complained about the wait and larger parties going before us. The four hostesses that were working didn't have enough sense to skip that question. You would think that between the four of them, that was a bad offer. Then they went down the line to offer that.  So then we order the signature burger, but are told no substitutions. Come on Ramsey, don't be like that. Let us take off the lettuce, especially since they are little pieces.   I will admit tho, the signature burger (once we removed the lettuce ourselves) was delicious. Short ribs with rib eye, and pickled onions were to die for!!!!! The farmhouse burger was also really good."}
{"text":"The best burgers in Vegas! This place is worth the long wait in line."}
{"text":"Had the \"Foie\" Burger with some onion rings. Rings were good. Reminded me of Funyuns in a good way. The burger was delicious. I'll definitely come back here when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was okay but staff needs some fine tuning     I just got the feeling that business was good so they really didn't care about your experience.  Burger was good but not good enough to bring me back.   I don't need to be fussed over but a simple greeting isn't too much to ask.    The checkin process was also very chaotic and disorganized.     Food was 4 stars  Service was 2 stars"}
{"text":"Excellent burger .   The atmosphere is nice. Very clean and quiet place. The service is a little slow. But my waitress was polite and nice.  Would have loved to take a picture of my mushroom burger but my battery died on my phone."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my son a few months back and have been meaning to write a review. I got the Farmhouse burger and some sweet potato fries... and my son got the Big Dawg. Mind you my child is 6 and took down this humongous hot dog. The little bit that he let me try was delicious. Now my burger... OMG. This burger guys. This burger? OMG. I just about died and went to burger heaven if south a place exists. The Dubliner cheese and the duck bacon and the fried egg just blended so well together that I could've ordered another had I not been trying to watch my calories. This place is definitely worth a try and worth the wait if there's a line out the door like there was when we went."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was beyond anything that I had imagined. The burger was by far one of the best I have ever had. We had a great time talking and laughing with our wait staff and it made for a memorable night. Do yourself a favor and try a milkshake!!"}
{"text":"If you're going to pay 40 bucks for a   , this is the place. Food was good, service was good. Its a churched up burger joint from a British celebrity chef. It's everything you'd expect, + and -."}
{"text":"Yep... Gordon Ramsay knows what he's doing, but was there really any doubt? The burgers were seriously fantastic. Came here on a double date and we all ordered different burgers so we could try a little of each other's. Each of them were excellent as well as the drinks. I ordered the antioxidant one. I cannot stress enough how delicious all of our burgers were so which ever one you choose to order will probably be delicious.  There was a really long line, but... there was a sign that said for parties of \"three or more\" to see the hostess. We did and boy am I glad we can read. They put us on a different list for bigger parties and we were seated in a reasonable amount of time without having to wait in that long line we initially saw. So we gambled a bit more and were then texted when our table was ready. We waited approximately 30 minutes total and if you saw the original wait line, it looked like a busy day at Disneyland so 30 minutes was great in our minds. They don't take reservations either so FYI.   I honestly can't wait to go back the next time we're in Vegas. The burgers are so worth the wait."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood hotel off of the Vegas strip. The restaurant is fairly easy to find since it is not fully enclosed. The exterior is decorated with a cool window displaying a fire design.   The menu is built around gourmet burgers. I ordered the Forest burger and Parmesan truffle fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned well with the Parmesan and truffle oil. It is enough for two to share as a side. The burger marinated well with the combination of mushrooms and tremor cheese. J was skeptical of trying the duck bacon since I am not a huge fan of bacon in general, but it complimented the burger itself, which was a thick patty. It was also topped with arugula and the sesame seed bun was toasted to a perfection and not too thick as to take away from the toppings.  I would definitely return to try one of the other burger options. The price point is decent considering it is a well crafted burger that will make you full. The menu offers a handful of burgers, but unfortunately you cannot substitute other toppings free of charge."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed! Terrible service!  Cold fries, no refills and no server for most of the meal! I have watched Gordon Ramsay for years and I went in there expecting top notch service.... not at all what we got! We spent over $100 on a burger and a drink and it was not good.  The service is what really killed it!!!! I know when it's busy you have to juggle your tables... but at least acknowledge us and let us know you will be right with us..... it took 25 minutes just to get waters. Such a disappointment!  Lisa Shaw"}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch at Godon Ramsay Burger. The onion rings were cooked perfectly. I had the forest burger and my husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger. We shared and both of the burgers were delicious. Forest mushrooms on the forest burger were amazing. The staff here is great. They're polite and attentive.  Strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went to this place because of the Gordon Ramsay name. I'm a big fan and the line is always long at this place. I have no complaints about the burger, it is good. However this place is pretty expensive. And keep in mind (atleast when I went there) the sides were not included so if you wanted fries you had to pay separate when most places included this in the price. The sweet potato fries though are great! My biggest disappointment was the desert (we got some sort of pudding) and it tasted just like a high school cafeterias pudding. Other than that I would give this place a shot and I like the design of it."}
{"text":"Here is a tip:  when the line is long and you can't wait an hour and a half to eat, get it to go. We did that last night because we were short on time and trying to make the Britney concert. You order from the hostess and pick up your food in about 30 minutes.   We sat in the casino sports lounge next door. I would totally do that again!  The tuna sliders had a lot of textures and flavors, I liked it. My favorite was the fries with curry sauce, I would get this again.  I want to try the portabella mushroom sandwich because my friend loved hers, she said it had the perfect flavor combination."}
{"text":"Expected way too much for this place, only to get disappointed.    Wait time: 40 minutes before we got seated, there was a line, ahhh must be fuxking good plus it's Gordon Ramsay for Christ sake!......then another 40 to get our food. That anticipation game is just adding up to the hype of eating burger of the famous Gordon Ramsay. (Not good when you have this type of mentality)   Location: Cozy, with \"Gordon Ramsay\" everywhere, plates, menu, coasters, even the little stick on the burger,  he also has a big picture displayed inside. Overrated.   Server: Good looking attentive tattooed chick  Food: I ordered the crown burger and bf ordered the \"hells kitchen\". Mine turned out to be salty and his is supposedly spicy but they must have used fake jalape√±os. French fries are ok.   Overall, don't set your standard too high just coz a famous chef owns it! In and out is better than waiting almost 2 hrs for a 15-20 dollars burger alone!"}
{"text":"Although the burger I had was delicious and the staff was great.  I was disappointed in the fact they way over cooked my burger and the fries completely sucked.  I would expect better after getting the top $22 burger it should at least be close. I asked for med rare and got med well to well done burger 0 pink.  The fries looked like they were the end of a bag.  Each fry was like 1/4-1/2 inch long.  I understand they are high volume but I would expect more even from  a chain burger joint how hard is it to cook a burger to proper temperature?"}
{"text":"I have been waiting a long time to try this place and I was not disappointed. The service was friendly and knew their stuff. After recommendations I decided to try the Hell's Kitchen burger and the Farmhouse burger. Both were delicious and cooked to perfection! The Hell's kitchen burger was not too spicy and the flavor was out of this world. The Farmhouse burger was like a  breakfast explosion in my mouth. The egg was cooked just right and not over done like some places. The onion rings and dipping sauces have changed my whole perspective and expectations when it comes to this side. The prices were reasonable, the staff was friendly, and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a mixed review.  5 stars for service, excellent staff and speed.  2 stars for the food. I gave a 2 star because the experience left me feeling like I don't want to go back. I love a good burger, this place has big but underwhelming burgers. I've had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, the Hog Burger (separate occasions), the fries, and the onion rings.  The taste blends together too much. It's just a hot mess of meat and bread. They have few sauce selections. The house ketchup is too pungent, and the ranch is a cheese ranch, too much on the cheese flavor. Nothing fresh that cuts through the burger flavor.  There are much better burgers nearby. Don't let the fire display distract you, I think this place has little to offer in terms of special Vegas experiences or in a special dining experience."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite lunch places when I am in Las Vegas.  Previously this restaurant was named Gordon Ramsey Burgr.  The quality of food and cleanliness has gone down substantially since the name change.  The Fire decor at the front of the restaurant is so dirty and grungy.  The sweet potato fries were hard not soft and crispy.  The dipping sauce for the fries tasted fishy.  The Hog Burger was still very good.  Service was still excellent."}
{"text":"What can I say about Gordon Ramsay? I can tell you if you're coming for a burger you will not be disappointed. The options are endless, and if you're willing to wait 30 minutes or so for your meal you'll be very pleased. My burger was outstanding. The set up the delivery of the presentation or on par. Excellent job. I would've given it five stars if it was just a little bit quicker but the food was so good that again as long as you have the time you're gonna be the supportive whatsoever."}
{"text":"I came here last Sunday before driving back home. I was going to eat-in but seeing the long line, I asked the hostess if I could get it to go, and hopefully, I could sit somewhere on the strip and eat it. I ordered the farmhouse burger and truffle fries. I was told that it would take 25min and that I could sit in the adjacent lounge. There was no space there because football games filled it up and I'm sure you have to buy drinks to sit there. I thought that I'd have nowhere to eat, so I asked if I could change my order to eat in and asked if there were seats for one. She said I could sit at the \"chef's table\"-(stools facing the kitchen). While I waited, I took my Rubiks cube out and started to solve it. I noticed the worker stop doing what she was doing and watch me solve it. Afterwards, she gave me a high 5 and I got a fist bump from the chef.        The girl (Lydia) asked where I bought my cube and I told her if I could write it down. I had said that I bought mine from eBay when the first came out with stickerless 7x7 cubes for about $50. Now that more companies have been making them, the price is now $23 from www.cubicle.us, a company in upstate New York, which is good because you don't have to wait for it to come in the mail from China. She said she wanted to buy one for her sister or was it her daughter. I told her how I learned to solve it by watching how-to videos from a Prof. Arthur Benjamin, the creator of Mathemagic. I told her that I took a month to \"master\" the 3x3. and that I watched YouTube to learn the 4x4. I told her that you need to learn how to do centers with the 4x4, and if you know the 3x3 and the centers of the 4x4, then you can solve any sized cube.       Next, the maitre d and I talked about how to solve it, and I told him that the night before, I went to Wahlburgers and drank to see how much is needed to slow me down. I said its more fun when you are drunk because now I have to think harder instead of solving it on \"auto-pilot\". I drank 3 drinks and still didn't slow me down much. He told me that I should eat now before my food gets cold. This was the best burger I've eaten yet. It's too bad I was still stuffed from the last night. I'm glad I decided to eat in. I ate half my burger the fries. The fries were great and was probably made with all natural truffle oil. I've bought a Perigord truffle once and I've bought artificial essence of black and white truffle that you mix with olive oil. After being halfway done, I stopped and played with my cube until I was able to eat again. Finally, I chatted with the chef and asked him if he had met the man himself. He told me that he his nothing like the Hell's Kitchen persona and that he is very mellow nowadays. I told him about how I love the UK version of Kitchen Nightmare, where he can curse, but it is more evidence that he cares. Check it out on youtube. I will try other burgers next time and I hope the chef there will go far in his career just like Marcus Wareing. I wish I knew the name of the chef. Lydia had told me, but I didn't hear her clearly. I also wished I learned the name of Maitre D'. I totally recommend this place and recommend sitting at the chef's counter."}
{"text":"Surprisingly it wasn't as good as I was hoping...  The wait wasn't too bad, they told us about 2 hours for a table of 8 but it ended up only taking 1 hour.   We got a poutine to split for the table, and I just got one of the burgers and truffle fries... No clue which burger it was, I think the hell's kitchen burger that had avocado in it. It was nothing spectacular though. In the end, service was pretty slow and food was just okay.   I had really high hopes for this place, but I only have myself to blame. I hyped it up for myself, next time, I'll just stick tot he buffets or something."}
{"text":"There are long lines for sure. I had the U.K. Burger and it was super tasty. This gourmet burger was worth the wait. Yes, all the hype is real. The Chutney sauce and the cheese makes the burger exceptional. I would definitely eat here again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was worry this place was all hype but the burger was very delicious. It is inside planet Hollywood right near an entrance. The wait was 30-40 mins on a weekend. The burger did not take too long to come. Service was decent.   We got the Hell's Kitchen and lobster/shrimp burgers. I enjoyed the lobster/shrimp burger a lot. The burger patty was very flavorful and you can taste the shrimp and lobster. The patty texture was very good too - doesn't fall apart and not mushy with a slightly chewy texture. The pickled carrots in the burger was nice and crunchy and added the needed acid to the burger. The buns were light and didn't feel too heavy.   I thought the burger was gonna be my caloric heavy weight but man the Oreo creme br√ªl√©e shake stole the title! It's super decadent and delicious but probably 800+calories! Definitely would order it again if we ever go back and workout like crazy to burn it off!   Glad we try this place!"}
{"text":"HUGE disappointment!  Come on, GR!  You may want to come check on this restaurant of yours.....  Server Ryan- rude.  Food- eh.  Would I return?  Probably not.  Mentioned to my Uber driver that we had been there and she said it's a common thing to hear her riders say they were disappointed with their experience.  I will say though,  the glass fire wall was super cool!"}
{"text":"I visited here on 7/9/17 during lunch. Our server was friendly and efficient (don't recall her name) and the place is very modern and cool. The flames in the glass wall leading inside were a really nice/different touch. All the food my friends and I ordered tasted great but there was one major snafu! When one of my friends took the first bite of his Portobello mushroom burger, a LONG BLACK FABRIC STRING CAME OUT THAT HAD BEEN COOKED INTO THE BURGER! WTF?!!! We called our server over asap and she apologized profusely stating that the string was probably from the towels used in the kitchen to handle hot plates. But still - gross! If Gordon himself had been there that day to see that, he would have cussed someone out royally! She took the burger away and ordered my friend a fresh one. Then the manager came over and apologized and comped our bill for that order. A new burger came out perfect and we enjoyed the rest of our meal. But that incident definitely tarnished my opinion of this place. It was our first time here and other than that, everything else was on point. There was only about a 5 minute wait time too. My cheeseburger with several different British cheeses was delish as were the onion rings we shared, Cheddar soup, and truffle fries with chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch. All-in-all and despite the \"string incident\", I would give it another chance and I plan to soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I traveled from Southern California to Las Vegas to try a Gordon Ramsay burger. I have to say that after waiting 45 minutes in line and another 45 minutes to get our order I was surprised how mediocre the food was. The burger was okay the fries were nothing special. I won't be back it was not worth the travel, time and wait."}
{"text":"Backed by a famous chef for a reason! This place blew the away when we were here on vacation recently. Location was in walking distance from our hotel, and wait was only five minutes even though it was super time. Food too a little while to come out but man oh man, what a delight it was. Will have to be back whenever I'm back in town. Hopefully soon"}
{"text":"The location was great in Planet Hollywood where we stayed. The burgers looked great. Considering  we waited for them to be cooked. My burger was not hot and it just came off the grill. My husband was in the middle of eating his. I contacted the manager. I informed her I waited for the burger to be cooked and I an in the restaurant so why was my burger not hot. She was accommodating and I waited for another burger to be cooked. The second won was hot. She said they have to be at a certain temperature. I understand but it still should be hot. It seemed it was pre cooked an d tossed on the grill to heat up but not hot all the was through. I love burger from medium well to well done. This on was requested well done. I had saut√©ed onions and no bacon or fancy topping added to it.  I didn't see anything special about the burger but  a bit over priced for the name."}
{"text":"You are paying for the name. Buffets are wasted on me, and I really wanted a Hell's Kitchen burger ... 1 burger and 2 lemon shandy beers later, $40 bucks was worth it for me. Was it a life-changing-melt-in-your-mouth decadent experience? No. But it was flavorful and spicy with every bite. Definately something to do once in Vegas! If you're complaining about price, hit up In-and- Out ... A cheese burger with anilmal style fries will fit your budget and you're appetite. :)"}
{"text":"My second time here. My friends ordered the burger and I customized one of the sandwiches to have mushrooms avocado and cheese and it was sooo good. The first time I was here I had the mushroom burger and it was also great! Our waiter was quick and friendly and made the whole experience even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here! Started off with a order of Kettle chip nachos! They were  then we ordered a grilled cheese for my son, and my wife and I got the Hells Kitchen burger and the Farmhouse burger! And boy they did not disappoint! We ordered them medium rare and they were cooked to perfection! Definitely would recommend coming here. Wait time to get a table was about 45 min but it's really worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great food and great wait staff! Long wait time but for good reason and worth it. The appetizer and burgers were cooked perfectly and the portion was just what we needed to feel full. The interactive tap list was pretty helpful as well."}
{"text":"Wow!! We were a party of 12 gave us a time frame of25 - 30 min wait. After waiting for 45 min still not ready. They were waiting for two party's to get out. After 55 min of waiting we finally got a table. Ramsay say the F all the time well this is one of those moment for us. F F"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place as I know Gordon Ramsey has high standards for his restaurants. Sadly to say I was a bit underwhelmed flavor wise, with my Forest Burger. The meat patty wasn't flavorful though I do like the duck bacon. Also my chips were really chewy and hard, like to they were overcooked. Are British chips supposed to be like that? If so, then I guess I just prefer fluffier fries."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to try this place out the last time I was in Vegas so this was bookmarked as one of the first places to eat when I came back.   Wait time: 45-1hr wait  Ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger - Medium rare and Parmesan truffle fries  - the burger was juicy, cooked to perfection, and had a nice kick from the jalape√±os. The burger looks small but it was soooo filling!  - Truffle fries were good with 2 sides of dipping sauce  Overall it was 3.5, the burger was good, the service was good but probably not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay gets so much hype that I had to at least try one of his chains. There is the Gordon Ramsay Burger at Planet Hollywood (there's also a Steakhouse, which is super expensive). I walked in thinking I would need to pay $50 for a burger, but it was surprisingly affordable at $16 for my Blue Cheeseburger. I really like the sweet taste to it (not overwhelming, but a tint) and remember you will need to order fries with it if you want. I think the burger itself was enough for me.  After trying the burger, I cannot tell if it's a special GR burger or just a regular homemade burger. Nothing too special but with a GR stamp.   Also, you get to take the menus for souvenirs in case you want it (which I left)."}
{"text":"Light, airy, and jam packed with pungent and juicy flavors that are a step away from melting in your mouth. Favorite burger so far, I got the Blue Cheesburger (blue cheese, figgy jam, arugula, cider vinegar reduction; I put the spicy mayo on the side).  10/10."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try a Ramsay joint and was super excited to. With all the hype around Ramsay I was sure this place would be good. Boy was I disappointed!! Are you kidding me!? This place was horrible. Can't believe I waited an hour to eat at this place when there were so many other options, it is Vegas. First the fries.. ordered extra crispy and when the food runner brought it out we asked if it was extra crispy and she was like sure. Then when we tried it, it was all soggy and def not crispy. Server came to check saw it wasn't right, took it away and brought us a new one. Same thing, no flavor and barely fried. Burgers.. there were 8 of us so we got to try everything from the lobster to the regular burger. Not sure if it all sat there a while before getting to the table but even the center of the meat was cold. The buns was stale and cold, probably didn't even get toasted. Not sure why this place had high ratings maybe cause of the name? However we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I had one of their most expensive meal, foie gras and it was my first time trying out. The meal was extremely delicious and their sangria was on point. For those two, I paid $43 including tip/tax. The meal wasn't too fulfilling for how much I paid, but it was somewhat expected. The servers seem to discriminate me a bit early on because I was a young Asian kid, going in by myself at the bar area. They were fine later on though."}
{"text":"Craving a good burger and staying nearby, we decided to give Gordon Ramsay Burger a try on a Monday evening. They do not take reservations but we figured we'd get in line and see how fast it moved. After about 5 minutes a girl came by with a tablet, took our name and number, and said we would get a text when our table was ready. She estimated the wait at about 30 minutes, which turned out to be quite accurate.   Our order taker-I hesitate to call him our server because he basically just took our orders-was clearly not interested in chitchat. His first words to us were \"are you ready for me?\" I can probably count on two hands how many words he spoke to us after that. We never saw a drink menu, which is apparently tablet-based because we saw other tables around us looking at it. We all ended up ordering iced teas, which was OK but we might have ordered something alcoholic...so basically they lost some of our business.   Anyway, we all ordered burgers of some sort and sweet potato fries to share. To his credit, our order taker warned us that the burgers would take about 30 minutes, which again proved to be pretty accurate. Our burgers were good but the fries were not especially hot. Portion sizes were decent and prices seemed reasonable, at least for a celebrity chef/gourmet burger joint on the Strip. We don't regret going but it probably won't be high on our list of places to visit next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger (Hells' Kitchen Burger), great service and a nice, friendly vibe, cant wait to go back and eat again"}
{"text":"This was the best aged burger I have ever had in my life. They have this one burger that they only serve 100 per shift that's made with aged steak and it's just the greatest thing ever! I love Hell's Kitchen but the Hell's Kitchen burger is too influenced on the sauce rather than the burger itself. The fries themselves were crisp and ultimately ended up melting in your mouth. We all loved every burger except ironically the Hell's Kitchen burger"}
{"text":"This is because of the incompetence of being able to seat us with the most dumb system ever. Waited over an hour and thirty min for a tuesday lunch. Not worth the wait after getting the food. Use your own system of vibrators than a cell phone text. Thought this would have been thought of by now."}
{"text":"Third time dining here.  Gets better every time.  Place was PACKED, but service was quick.  Ordered a kale quinoa salad that was probably one of the best I've ever tasted.  Loved every bite and quite large too!  Will be back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I just went here for the first time while we were on vacation in Vegas, and we were so glad we did. Those burgers were definitely worth the wait, and the staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Service is just okay, but the burgers are always worth it. There's usually quite a line to get in, but it's Vegas after all, so grab a drink and hang tight, I promise the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Helluva place. The service was amazing. Even after I screwed up my burger order, the staff moved to fix MY mistake like it was their own. I had the \"Hells Kitchen\" burger and it was awesome. Further more the truffle fries were amazing. My gf had the fish and chips which she loved.  Again the service here was phenomenal and the food great. I would go back just for the truffle fries and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a must for anybody who loves a good burger. We had sweet potato fries and the burgers were bursting with flavors. If you want to eat here with out waiting in line some after 2:00. Regardless, it is worth the wait! It is on the pricy side, but worth the experience. The waiters are friendly and it was a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for the quality. I'm speaking about the burger I had. The wings were pretty good, but I expected a better experience with my burger."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Ramsey Burger is a must stop during our trips to Vegas! They recently updated their menu which was disappointing because I wanted the Yard Burger (chicken), but it's been removed! I tried one of the other burgers which was cooked perfectly. Tons of flavor. I ordered the Parmesan Truffle fries as well and they are addicting! The service was alright. The waitress was familiar with the menu but I had to ask for refills which was frustrating."}
{"text":"Update: 10 stars for this place if I can give it!! They lost our ticket and we had to wait for over an hour. How does that warrant a 10 star rating? Both the manager and the waiter came to apologize. They comped the entire meal and even give us a shake to go! I highly recommend this place! We will definitely need back!!  P.s. shout out to our waiter Christian! You were amazing! We hope to see you soon!"}
{"text":"The wait wasn't extremely long when I came in on Saturday. Maybe a 15 minute wait to be seated, but for the food was around 30 minutes. Service was on point though! Very attentive service.   I got I believe the Hell burger (I think that's what it's called). It was good, had jalape√±o, avocado, tomato, beef. It's was a great burger, but it's just a mediocre burger anyone burger restaurant carries. Delicious and satisfying but not finger licking.   My boyfriend got the farm burger (again I think that's what it's called) and just the same as mine. A burger you can get anywhere.   Our friend for the Foie burger (again I think that's what it's called) and he said it's a legit burger. Like the best he's had. I believe him because it was one of the most expensive burger on the menu.   We all got the truffle fries and it was delicious! I love it, but I hope I didn't just love it because I was starving... I did notice it was extremely salty so I couldn't eat a lot.   Overall, it's a great restaurant to try once and say you've eaten here. But the price is a little high and the food just isn't something I'd pay for because I can get the same meal elsewhere but for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"I ordered a hotdog, it was subpar in comparison to the reputation of the restaurant. The service was not great, our waitress never checked in on us. However my friends had the specialty burgers and they absolutely loved it. The burgers were juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"This is one of the most delicious burgers you can taste. I had the anniversary burger (not on the menu) and it is amazing. The service are quick and good. The wait line was not that bad (15 min), but worth the wait. If you in town and craving a burger, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We were excited to go here on our first trip to Vegas in over 10 years but little did we know we should have passed on this place. We waited 1 hour to be seated and 1 hour for our food.  Service was terrible, the waiters never asked us how our food was or even refilled our drinks. The 17.00 burger was good but the bun was very greasy. At the end of our meal, we waited and waited for our waiter to bring our check.  Then we had to walk up to the register to pay because the guy never came back to pick up our check and payment. You'd think for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant at their high prices would have extraordinary service. But unfortunately Denny's would have been a better experience! Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality burgers at a high price.  If I'm paying this much for a burger, I expect the quality that Gordon Ramsay Burger brings to the table. Each bite is full of richness. I also really liked their truffle fries.  We put our name down on the waitlist and ended up waiting about 2 hours. Fortunately, Gordon Ramsay Burger takes down your phone number and you will receive a text to make your way back to the restaurant. Since it's located in the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mall, you can shop while waiting to be called. Once you get the text, your entire party has to present itself and you will have to wait in a line at the front of the restaurant for a bit.  --  taste / 5 aesthetics / 5 vibe / 5 service / 4 price for quality / 3 OVERALL / 4.4"}
{"text":"I am happy to be here. it was very delicious. I recommends hog bugger! french fry also was very good."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay is basically my food idol. I've always wanted to eat at one of his restaurants ever since I heard about them. I got the fries and they were pretty thick which filled me up a bit. It was good though with nice flavor but a little too filling. I also got the forest burger which was cooked to perfection! The meat just softly melts in your mouth and it's so juicy and flavorful. The buns were the perfect texture to complement the soft meat. Overall I was in love and I can't wait to try another one of his restaurants.   Gordon Ramsay,  teach me your ways!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 and a high chair. The wait was an hour long to be seated. They texted me my table was ready but made us wait another 10 mins. We places our orders and it took another 30-40 mins for our food to be ready. Food was good, but not worth the wait. Plus it was like 16 dollars a burger not including fries or drink. Our tab was 180."}
{"text":"This place is excellent for burgers for sure. I came here after looking at yelp reviews and I must say I am impressed. Good burgers, beers and fries. When I come back to vegas this will definitely be a place to come back to. Long lines but worth waiting for."}
{"text":"I went here with my classmates while TDY to Nellis around September of last year and I was not impressed. My burger was not that great, just okay and it was expensive. It really was unfortunate since I took the recommendation of the waiter that said that was the feature burger of the week. The service was good so that was redeeming and a couple of the folks I was with said they liked their burger but not for the price. I'd recommend other lesser known burger joints over this one that are cheaper, tastier and a shorter wait time."}
{"text":"Got off to lousy start. When I pulled out my chair, it was covered in filth,. Seriously, a nasty amount of food, like someone had wiped down the table and was trying to sweep it on to the floor but missed. Amazing buffalo wings? Nope... your local pizza joint probably has better. Crisp onion rings, not so much. Who doesn't love French fries with curry catsup? Me, if you buy them here. Beer selection was really good. The \"blue burger\" was well above average."}
{"text":"I found this to be the best burger spot ever! They have so many options which is not typical. Who knew a pescatarian could find both a veggie burger and a lobster & shrimp burger! Resturant has a waiting line most of the time Resturant very busy however the staff was very attentive and happy to get anything you needed!  Will defiantly seek out the Ramsay Resturant in NYC next month.  Resturant decor may scare someone off because the presentation would lead you to believe it would be very expensive....... but honestly the menu is priced quite modestly and the quality of food exceeded expectations! Treat yourself"}
{"text":"We ordered the shrimp lobster burger and it was one of the most amazing burgers I've ever eaten. The burger was juicy and full of flavor. It came with truffle fries which was very good as well. The wait time was long but we were prepared for that."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience the first time so of course I went back. But the second time I went, it was a much different experience.   I had a horrible visit with our server Janet and the manager Eric. If you are looking for great service, this is not the place to go!   After we were seated we ordered waters right away and when she brought them we were ready to order. It took 55 minutes to get our food and when we finally did there was a huge problem. Last time I was there I ordered they turkey burger and loved it so I ordered it again and it looked much different. It looked like chicken this time and last time it more resembled beef. When I questioned Janet, she went on about their spicy chicken patty...listening was just not her thing. She then said that I was probably given beef last time. I asked to speak to the manager. I explained to him the problem and he said there was nothing he can do.  I took a few bites of the burger and did not like it, leaving over half. I told Karen that I did not like it and had lost my appetite and she said \"Excellent, no worries.\" Who says that?!  She then charged me for it and I asked her to take it off because she took it away. She sent Eric to our table and he took her side and told me there was nothing he could do. He then proceeded to get in an argument with me and refused to leave my table when I asked I'm to.   Dont' waste your visit to LV on this place."}
{"text":"Decided to have our last meal in Vegas here. Waited in line for about 15 minutes which wasn't to bad. Ordered the Crown Burger and the Blue Cheese burger, the burgers were cooked well bit disappointed as was expecting more flavour in the burgers. Also sampled the truffle fries which were delicious. The meal was expensive and not sure if worth the money"}
{"text":"2017 Review 33/100  5 stars for some of the best food and best service I've ever received at a restaurant. I'm a Gordon Ramsay fan and this was my first time at one of his restaurants and I was very impressed.  The food was the shining star, as it should be. We had the hummus as an appetizer and W.O.W. It was probably some of the best - if not THE best - hummus I've ever had in my entire life, no exaggeration. After we finished the dish I immediately looked up Ramsay's recipe and I plan to make it very soon. Funny enough, neither of us ordered burgers and this burger joint. We had burgers for lunch so we were feeling something different. My friend ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca Sliders and I had the Wheatberry-Quinoa Salad. Both were extremely good. And the burgers looked amazing. I really want to return again and try one. For desert, it was the Blood Orange Creamsicle. Tangy orange popsicle goodness with a creamy center. We also ordered drinks. I had the Skinny Screw and she had the Acai Lemonade. Again, very, very good.  Our waiter, Ryan, was the best. He was super personable and knew the menu extremely well so he was able to make some great recommendations on what to order. Since he seemed to be such a foodie we even asked him for a recommendation on where to go for breakfast the next morning and his recommendation did not disappoint (see my review for Mon Ami Gabi).  It's worth noting this place does not take reservations. You will have to wait in line to get a table. How long you have to wait just depends on the day and time you choose to dine here. We went on a weekday for a little bit earlier dinner and only had to wait about 15 minutes. But I have heard from others the wait can get up to 2 hours, so plan accordingly, particularly if you are catching a show afterward.  The hype is real and I highly recommend you add Ramsay's burger joint to your Vegas foodie \"to do\" list."}
{"text":"This was on my Vegas bucketlist so my friends and I had to come here on our visit. There were 10 of us and we were seated fairly quickly. They even text you when they have a table available, however they don't take reservations. I had the specialty lobster and shrimp burger and it was delicious. My drunk self definitely thanked myself for saving the other half for later that night. Most of my friends thought it was the best burger they had ever had."}
{"text":"Been here twice and it was okay both times.  Nothing about the food or atmosphere justifies the long line.   Must be fans of the show that come here because the food just isn't amazing enough to justify standing in line over 30 min.  The fish sandwich was bland.  It didn't have anything to give it Pop!  I wish there was a spicy tartar with lemon on it. The Ribeye Special burger I had was ruined by the shredded beef that was all over the burger.  Ribeye burger is by itself supposed to be more than enough.  I just didn't like it.  The best part of the meal was the truffle fries.  If you come and eat here, those are a must!!!  If I ever return, it will be for those yummy fries."}
{"text":"I didn't really want a burger for dinner, but after walking the strip, we ended up here. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen (hot) burger. It was very good. My daughter ordered the Farm burger and loved it. The skinny screw was very good too."}
{"text":"Great food and staff. Definitely a bit on the expensive side for a burger and pub restaurant.  I would love to return but would need to save up some $$$$ first."}
{"text":"We ate here last weekend with a group of 20 people. The service was great. The ambiance was relaxing and comfortable. I loved that they put our name down in the beginning and texted us when our table was ready. So in the meantime we shopped around! Now about the food. Delicious. I was honestly not even that hungry because we had a somewhat late breakfast, but I definitely did not want to miss out, so went ahead and ate anyway. We started off with 3 kinds of fries - sweet potato fries, the just fries, and the truffle parmesan fries. The parmesan fries were hands down the best! And the sauces that came with were so good. Next came our burger. Our entire group was basically divided in half between the Backyard burger and the Hells Kitchen burger. The latter sounded more appealing to me, so I went with that. And It. Was. Good. So Good. We are definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"By far the most juicy burger I've EVER eaten! Cool restaurant & we were seated quickly for being prime dinner hours! We got the Hells Kitchen burger & the Crown burger, both excellent with awesome flavors & textures. They say their most popular is the Hells Kitchen burger, but I personally liked the crown a little better! I will be going to more of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants in the future!!"}
{"text":"Solid burger joint with the man, the myth and the legend, Gordon Ramsay, slapping his name on it to make it famous. We were seated immediately because we went at 2:30 in the afternoon, but be warned that it isn't a large restaurant so wait time can be bad. After ordering, burgers take about 30 minutes to come out, with the option of your fries coming out before or with your burger.   My fianc√© got the Hog Heaven which is a pork burger with BBQ pork and tons of other meaty toppings. Although he went in with a huge appetite, he could only polish off a little more than half. I ordered the Patriot Burger, which is a turkey burger with smoked Gouda, cherry chutney, spicy mayo and crunchy topping. I LOVED it, and after peeling off over half of the bun, I was totally able to finish mine. The fries were tasty, and we found it more than enough to share an order.   I would certainly be back during non-peak times, but I'm interested in his steakhouse now, too!"}
{"text":"Had to try Golden Ramsay for that one time! Located inside the casino, the line was super long even on a weekday so get here early! I believe if you have 3 or more people, you can bypass the line to the front and check in with the hostess. To be honest, I expected more from a restaurant named after Gordon Ramsay. Waitresses were nice but they were sort of unprofessional, talking about calling in sick and such. Also, the service was slow, I know it's busy, but it shouldn't take 10 minutes or so just to get our order in or to get water. Food took over 45 minutes after it was ordered, which was a bit long. I was looking forward to the chicken burger but they replaced it with some other burger, so I was disappointed. I ended up getting the cheese burger which was pretty good, I wish it came with a side of fries (which has to be ordered separately)."}
{"text":"Excellent burger you get here. Wait is pretty serious here. They text you, when your table is ready, within 10 minutes you have to show up, unless they give your table to the next. It happened to us.. So we had to wait another 45 minutes, but it was worth it! It located in side of Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"I was honestly underwhelmed by this restaurant.  If Gordon Ramsay had actually been here, I hope he would have sent our food back.  I don't know how a burger with bacon, egg, and cheese on it can be bland, but they managed it.  The patty itself was seriously underseasoned, which makes for a sad burger.  The fries (thick wedge-style) were also completely devoid of any salt - we actually did send these back, because they were not tasty at all.  It wasn't a good burger, and definitely not worth waiting 40 minutes in line for."}
{"text":"Well, we waited in line a long time for a good burger, but I certaintly won't eat here again. It was still just a burger. The fries and onion rings were different from the typical place and were far above average. I will say that the seats were surprisingly comfortable. Otherwise, it was louder and more crowded than I would like after sitting at casino tables all day. Our server was excellent and the other servers all helped each other out."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed with this place.  I thought for a 25 dollar burger it would be amazing but it just tasted very beefy.  I couldn't taste anything else on the burger.  I will say the serving of fries and the burgers are huge.  It was definitely way too much food."}
{"text":"I Had to wait 1 hour to seat, another hour for the food, but the food is delicious, hamburger was great and natchos was really yummy! I think  he should open another location , so it would not be so crazy busy, it is the reason i give 4 stars not 5, because the wait is a joke."}
{"text":"We waited almost an Hour to be seated, after which it took an even longer time to get our food. --minus 1 star A menu was present near the initial line so we were able to decide our food even before we reached the table.  The FARMHOUSE BURGER was great, though the fried egg could have been a little more runny. The proteins blended together to create a very satisfying taste. The HELL's KITCHEN BURGER was super delicious yet not too heavy midst all that goodness! (Avocado + jalape√±os are a great combo)   Both burgers were worth the wait. But not sure I'd come again on a short visit- the entire experience takes up A LOT of time. (Could be due to the popularity and its Vegas after all!)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service, and one of the best burgers I've ever had. We had to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant while we were in town and opted for burgers for lunch. Not the most family friendly place so I wouldn't take little kids but older kids do just fine. The fries are excellent and two orders fed six in our group. Try the Hog Burger if your up for a challenge - think upscale Cheeseburger in Paradise."}
{"text":"I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and the kettle chips nachos with beef. The nachos were great as the kettle chips mixed with the sauce and beef had a great blended taste.  The burger however was a major disappoint! All I could taste was the avocado. It took over the entire taste of the burger. The bun was soft and delicious but everything else inside was not. The patty was cooked just how I liked it , but I couldn't enjoy it because of the dominant avocado taste.  Came out disappointment as the place wasn't anything special"}
{"text":"I typically am basic with my burger, but I branched out a little here. I ordered the Farmhouse Burger which has bacon, egg, and cheese...I was not disappointed! I also got the truffle fries which were great! People traveling with me loved the sauce/dip that came with the fries."}
{"text":"Everything was exceptional. As I think about my meal my mouth is starting to water.   RECOMMENDATION: if you're going with a small party or even another guest, I would recommend getting two different burgers and splitting them. There are so many delicious options to pass up on!   Truffle fries: a thicker cut fry sprinkled with parmesan cheese and comes with ketchup and another dipping sauce. (Perfect for sharing) They were perfectly cooked, meaning they weren't soggy or over cooked. The other dipping sauce had a touch of garlic to it which made the French fry experience that much better.   Blue cheeseburger: Holy mother of flavors. Comes with blue cheese and manchego, fig jam, cider vinegar reduction and spicy mayo. From the first bite to the last, there is an explosion of flavor. The sweetness of the fig jam compliments the savory of the two different cheeses while the heat of the mayo gives it that extra kick that you didn't even know you needed. This is by far one of the best burgers I've ever had.   Hell's Kitchen burger: more of a classic style burger with extra heat. We opted out of the roasted jalape√±os but the jalape√±o aioli was more than enough to bring the burger up a notch."}
{"text":"The presentation of the establishment is nice, even if no thought about the environmental impact is taken into account with the 24 hours a day flames. The fries tasted stale, and the burger meat was a bit on the dry side."}
{"text":"Literally the BEST burger I have ever had in my life! I still salivate thinking about it."}
{"text":"Shouldn't be this hard to rate an establishment. While I would have rated it higher, if you are comparing, I went to Guy Fieri's place the night before. That became my number one all time ever, and after visiting Gordon Ramsey's Burgr, Guy's is still my number 1. In fact sorry I can't say Gordon's is my all time number 2. Don't get me wrong, it was good. But not the best.   So if you are out for the best, I've compared for you. I think you will be happy with my honest burger opinion. ."}
{"text":"Second time trying this burger place and it was not very impressive again. I've had the truffle parmesan fries and foie burger. I could not taste the foie gras spread. The patty was cooked perfectly but it was quite bland. Our fries were thick cut so it's not really crispy and lack of truffle flavors. I tried my friends onion rings and it was surprisingly good. Sorry but it was not worth over an hour wait.."}
{"text":"Go for the burger! Ha! This place is self explanatory. The flames are very eye catching with a mesmerizing motion to draw you towards the long line of people waiting to have a bite of one of these mouth-flavoring burgers.   It's conveniently located near an entrance which is great if you want to avoid the cigarette smoke when walking through the casino area."}
{"text":"I'm torn with this place. I love Gordon Ramsay and perhaps my expectations were too high. The burger was good, but for the value and wait it wasn't worth it. First, you only get the burger for the price. No fries or side items. I can deal with that but not at $15-20 for the burger. Second the desserts sucked. I got some pudding that tasted very plain like a 99 cent pudding. The line was very long and we waited but if a place is popular kudos to them. The staff is nice, the place is clean, no complaints in that department. The fire pit thing in front is a nice touch as well. I would give this place a 3.5, it is good, not great considering the name it has."}
{"text":"This was a good burger. Was it the best I've had? No. The meat had great flavor but was too dry for me. I did ask for it to be cooked well done and that was probably a mistake. I always get my meat well done and I've had very juicy burgers. But here it wasn't that way. I loved the batter on the onion rings but not the Parmesan cheese they added on top....it made it too salty. Service was outstanding. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"I had high expectations considering it has Gordon Ramsey's name on it. The burgers were outstanding (we had the farmhouse and ultimate) and they were cooked to perfection. The truffle fries are definitely sharing size so don't let the $11 price tag deter you. The beer selection could be a little better but has some decent staples. Now the not so great...the service. Even my 16 year old recognized that that our server was clueless. He kept forgetting what we said and seemed totally distracted. I get that it's a relatively new place but perhaps a bit more training would help."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fun and the service was great.   The onion rings were a big hit at our table. Unfortunately, two of the three burgers we ordered were overcooked. Outside of that, it's a good restaurant and fun place to eat."}
{"text":"We had the Hell's kitchen burger , Butter Pecan Milkshake and Beer battered onion Rings.  Onion Rings were good , could have improved on the portion though.  The burger is one of the best I've ever had. My 2 cents -- Add the Roasted Jalapeno to it . The milkshake is so good ! 2 of them a day is definitely worth 2000 calories though :)  Highly recommend !   -Pradeep"}
{"text":"If you're a Gordon Ramsay fan and you're in Vegas you need to check out one of his restaurants. We were all craving a burger and went here. The line was around the corner to get in for dinner but we were able to get on a list and they called us. They said 45 min wait but it was much faster. We went and got a drink while we waiting in Planet Hollywood. I liked how they let us bring in our outside drinks to our tables, server even got us a glass to pour our beers into to match the restaurant atmosphere. We had two couples and shared two orders of delicious parmesan truffle fries. I split a 16$ burger with my wife that was really good.  Only unfortunate thing happened was when I got up to leave my pants got stuck to some gum on the chair. No fault to the restaurant but was not fun to try and get off. Server felt bad and hopefully changed the chair for the next guests."}
{"text":"Burger is a great spot to visit in Vegas. For parties of two or less, stand in line ( next to the amazing wall of fire at the entrance) and wait to be seated. For parties of three or more, place your name on a list wth the hostess. If there is a wait, you will be texted once your table is ready, a very convenient feature which allows guests to go elsewhere on the Planet Hollywood floor. We were seated after a 20 minute wait. Our booth was roomy and comfortable (note-the majority of seating in the restaurant was booths...a feature I LOVED). Drinks were ordered and the server provided helpful tips across the board. We ordered the kettle chip nachos as a starter-the brisket was tender, the chips were thick and well-seasoned, and the cheese was creamy (English cheddar cheese blended in with sour cream-delicious). I ordered the Blue Cheeseburger, and it was sensational. Juicy, tender, and bursting with flavor. The figgy jam and cheese were an amazing combination. The bread was soft and delicious. This burger was hands-down the best I have had in a while, definitely this year:) I even ordered mine \"well done\" which can frequently be too dry...it was not. It was a juicy flavor-explosion, and I am already planning our next visit.  We ordered truffle fries as well, to share. I love the thick-cut style, and the seasoning was nice. The truffle aioli, which accompanied the fries, was okay-honestly, the aioli seemed better suited to plain fries, since truffle on truffle was just a lot. But they were very good fries, and the ketchup was tangy and flavorful. Two thumbs up, definitely visit if you are in town."}
{"text":"The hummus and pita here are by far the best I have ever eaten. As a Gordon Ramsay fan, I was stoked to try this place out and it definitely met my expectations. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight and ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, truffle fries, and onion rings. The burger was a perfect medium well with a nice crunch on the outside and pink in the middle. The burger itself was seasoned so well! The toppings gave every bite a great taste. The fries were great and so were the dipping sauces. I enjoyed the onion rings especially the dips they give with the rings. The service is wonderful, truly. The food took a bit but for this case it was worth it. Go here!"}
{"text":"Which chef doesnt taste his own food? I Was at this restaurant, i Got appetizer, main course and dessert, it was good expect The dessert, i Got a White chocolate parfait and it tasted like cheese, really strong. When i complaint The server told that no one Would taste it?? They asked me If i wanted a new dessert, but seemed like they didnt Care.  If it was my restaurant i would always taste my food"}
{"text":"It pretty much lived up to the hype! Huge line for lunch but we were able to give our name & phone number so we could wander around or gamble. We did split up to do that & the wait was shorter than the 40 min. It was about a half hour but felt a lot faster.   Walking by, there were a bunch of empty tables. And we were seated at one of them later. I never understand why places do that, is there not enough staff or does it take that long to seat people?   Anyways on to the food:  Chicken wings (5+)- Prob the best damn chicken wings I've had in my life. The sauce was perfect. It was not a normal chicken wing but like a lollipop style where it's cut differently and the meat literally just falls off the bone. The blue cheese sauce is a must with it, my cousin wanted to opt out since he's not a blue cheese fan but he's so glad we got it on the side so he could try it & he was a fan.   Blue Cheese Burger (4 stars)- This was my favorite out of the 3 that we had. I love blue cheese & ah fig jam brings the sweet & salty aspect of it. I've had better burgers so it's not quite 5 stars but def satisfied the craving.   Hells Kitchen Burger (4 stars)- my second fav and others first. So I guess it's also all personal preference. This was a tasty burger though.   Forest Burger (3.5 stars)- I found this one to be a bit dry. Thank goodness for the duck bacon which made the burger have flavor but as a whole nothing to write home about.   Truffle Parmesan Fries (5+)- god damn these were good. You know how you order these and all the Parmesan eventually just falls to the bottom? Well this place knows how to do it right. Perfect seasoning on each fry & homemade dipping sauces (truffle aioli & homemade ketchup) were excellent!! A must order!   Overall if I were craving burgers in Vegas I may come back or try another place. It was surprising to me that the things I enjoyed most weren't the burgers though. So maybe I need to try different appetizers, sides & dessert next time!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to Gordon Ramsay Burger, especially because we had Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips the day before and absolutely loved it. Unfortunately, it did not meet the hype. It was a 45 minute wait for a table of 10, and another 15-20 minutes for the actual burger.   We ordered the truffle fries. I don't agree with some of the reviews here, about the truffle fries being amazing. I've definitely had better. The fries were thick cut and not crispy, and the sauce that accompanied it was just okay. Gordon Ramsay Burger has their own homemade ketchup which none of us was a fan of. The onion rings were slightly better than the fries but again, I've definitely had better. For my entree, I've had one of their \"secret\" burgers which consisted of NY Strip and Ribeye and cost $22. The meat itself was amazing - very juicy and tender, absolutely delicious. My boyfriend had the Forest burger. He did not like it at all and only had a couple of bites. He thought it was dry. My friend had the hotdog, which he thought was good.   Service was great and the restaurant itself was beautifully renovated. I'd probably go back to Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips and Gordon Ramsay Steak and skip this one."}
{"text":"I'm not into burgers but the alternatives are delicious. I ordered the wheat berry and quinoa salad. It was amazing! For dessert I ordered the chocolate parfait. It was also delicious, creamy and there was a bite of fresh berries in each spoonful.  I don't drink alcohol but husband does and he enjoyed the Squatters IPA. The alcohol is pricey @ 11.00 for an average size beer. The rest of the food was a good price."}
{"text":"All the burgers here are great!! The onion rings were pretty thick to my liking! However the truffle fries are a must have. If you have a total rewards card and rank in the platinum or higher you do not have to wait in line which rocks because this place can definitely get busy.   Their home made truffle aioli, ranch and chipotle ketchup are all amazing sauces. Definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"If you are a party of two there is a line for you to wait, but if you have a bigger group, they'll text you when your table is ready so you don't have to wait in line.     My friends and I all got one shake of different flavors.   I got the Cr√®me Brulee pudding with oreos milkshake, it was the best one out of all them.   But, even with my sweet tooth, I couldn't handle all the sugar, it was straight up diabetes in a cup.       All their burgers are delish but it is very salty.   A fair warning.   This is definitely a man's meal, if you know what I mean, not for the faint in heart."}
{"text":"Just finished one of the best burgers I've ever had! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and the sweet potato fries. The experience was what you would expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The presentation was spot on. The cook on the meat was perfect. It was juicy without being messy. Everything was perfectly seasoned. The waitstaff were friendly and knowledgeable and the food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. I couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"I was actually very surprised by \"Burger\". I ordered their \"hells kitchen\" burger.  I didn't expect much since most restaurants believe it or not don't know how to make a good burger.The meat was very delicious and perfectly seasoned. Juicy and not over seasoned to hide the taste of the meat. The buns were toasted perfectly and the jalape√±os were a delicious option as well. Our waiter was very friendly and pleasant. Despite how busy they were I was surprised at how fast the food came as well. I would love to go back to this place again!!"}
{"text":"Dawg, I haven't been to Bachi Burger yet, but dawg these burgers right chear, these burgers right chear!  Greats buns, ingredients, and perfectly cooked patties.  Just plan to wait in line.    If you're a burger dude like me, you will absolutely notice that these are qualities burger that won't disappoint....As of now this is my favorite burger spot in Vegas.  Still got to try Bachi, Bobby, and Holsteins."}
{"text":"BLOW MINDED! I only gave 4 stars just because the line was 2 hours!  But the food is amazing Truffle fries: i know everyone recommend it but for me they smell weird and taste bad Anniversary burger was BLOWMINDED go for it"}
{"text":"I think the portabella burger here is incredible. The sweet potato fries without the sugar topping also good... but not great. soggy. What is NOT GOOD are the sauces that accompany the fries. Ew. So nasty I don't get why these are something Gordon gets behind. The yellow one is waxy and tastes like lemon. Gross. It also looks like pudding. The red one is not ketchup. They don't have regular ketchup. Bottom line, I don't want to spend $20+ on a burger if there aren't good fries to pair it with and good sauces.   I wish they amp up their game."}
{"text":"We had lunch on Friday. Seated immediately- got there a little before noon, by the time we were done there was a long line. Compliments to our waiter, John. Explained the choices very well and made very good suggestions. Happened to also watch him find a package that another table left, picked it up and ran out the front after them to take to them. I had the Farmhouse burger. Didn't like the duck bacon but just removed it and enjoyed it without. I really liked the Parmesan truffle fries, husband didn't, he thought it tasted garlicky. He had the backyard burger and really liked it. It was more on the medium rare side and we asked for medium but overall good. Prices very reasonable.  The star for us was the dessert orange creamsicle- blood orange and a total surprise. I do get tired of similar desserts and this was a very pleasant ending to lunch. The manager was very present and engaged in what was happening with the patrons. Overall a very good experience"}
{"text":"Get the short rib nachos. You won't be disappointed. I took off 1 star because my burger was overcooked and the $11 truffle fries were lack luster. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Prepare to stand in line but good thing they accept reservation and they will text you when the table is ready. So while waiting, why not play some slot machines in the area!?! The burger is definitely gordon ramsay's style. Worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointing: I ordered a Hell's burger to go on a Sunday afternoon. Restaurant was busy, but nothing out of the ordinary for what they are used to. The order took about an hour (which was totally Ok and they prepared me for). However... when a person spends $18 on a burger (without any sides), they expect it to have some good flavor and at LEAST be hot! I was waiting for the burger at the nearby Extra Bar and as soon as I received the text notice, I made the 30 second walk to go pick it up. When I sat down to eat it (30 seconds later) I was sadly disappointed by it's lack of flavor and the fact that it MIGHT have been luke warm(ok, nope... totally cold). I tried to convince myself that it was better than it was (since it was a little $$$), but in the end... lesson learned... In-n-out burger tops Gordon Ramsey burger any day of the week"}
{"text":"When I order a burger medium well it shouldn't be extremely pink inside.  Did my order get mixed up with someone who order their burger rare!?!? And then to not even offer to remove the burger from the $130 check is very surprising, being it was obviously your mistake and you were made aware of the situation.  Sorry, but how can I leave a tip in this situation.  Very poor customer service Tammy!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big Gordon Ramsey fan because I think he's mean..LOL.  However, my fiance is a huge fan and had to have something from one of his restaurants while we visited Vegas this past Dec.  So we tried his burger spot.  It was the best burger that I have ever had..literally.  We didn't dine in, my fiance got it to go, so even with that said (note, I like my food piping hot) it was such a flavorful burger.  I can't tell you the exact names of the burgers we had, but we both had something different, and felt the exact same..best burger ever.  So bottom line it's not even what you get, the quality of beef used and the execution of your burger will always be on point.  We are definitely going to make a return visit the next time we are in Vegas and we'll dine in."}
{"text":"Had to see what the hype was about.  It was better than average but nothing mind blowing or life changing.  Presentation wise the burger looked perfect.  It tasted excellent.  Price was expensive but you are paying for the name.  French fries were expensive unless it was all you can eat.  The Big Dawg was huge and very tasty.  Be prepared to wait some time before your food arrives.  It is not McD's."}
{"text":"This place was great. Truffle fries a crown burger and a beer. Meat was perfectly cooked and the buns felt and tasted like they were made just for our burgers. Some say it's hard to f up a burger.... but it happens all the time. Over cooked... stale bread... yuk.  But not here! Perfectly done! Cheers Gordon. We will return!"}
{"text":"Best tasting burger. The meat is so delicious and flavorful. The bun. The truffle fries. The cheese. Omg I just love this place. Had the ultimate cheeseburger, truffle fries, and a sangria. Together on of the best meals I ever had."}
{"text":"Sorry for the long review, just thought I would explain everything that happened.  So I was flying from Iowa to Sacramento with an overnight stop in Las Vegas. Thought I would stop in at Gordon Ramsey Burger Restaurant and get a burger.  I got there around 5:00 pm on a Monday and there was no one in line. That was good for 1 star.  Sat down at the counter instead of waiting for a table.  GORDON, GORDON, GORDON!!!  What happened after that was a testament for not eating at the bar.  Ordered a drink, Captain Morgan and Pepsi (they don't have coke, mistake #1), was a little watered down or else Pepsi makes it taste funny.  Ordered the Forest Burger cooked medium and some fries.  Waited about 30 minutes before the burger arrived which is normal for this restaurant.  Ordered another drink just before my food came, Captain Morgan and Pepsi, that is even hard to say. No improvement in the drink, actually was more watered down than the first (mistake #2).  First bite, no pink, no flavor, no rush of \"Whoa, that tastes so good\".  Took a few more bites, no pink whatsoever in that overcooked burger (mistake #3).  The duck bacon was overcooked, but at least the bacon had some flavor along with the mushrooms and cheese.  I slow ate the burger waiting for someone to come over and ask me how the food was.  No one ever asked me how the food tasted or was it cooked right.  There were three of us customers sitting next to each other.  We all got to talking and we all had the same problem, overcooked food and no one asked us about the food.  Back to my situation, the bartender offered me another drink, I declined and said \"I'm good\".   About another 5 minutes later, the bartender finally noticed, which was about 25 minutes after I started eating and said, \"I see you are slowing down there buddy\".  Finally, I get to let them know about the food, which should have happened 3-4 minutes after I received the burger.  I let him know that the burger was overcooked, I still had only eaten about 2/3 of the burger, so it was there to be seen.  He asked, \"Was it cooked medium well\".  I raised my eyebrows and then he said, \"Oh, Well done, eh\".  He then let me know that he would get the manager.  The manager came over asked what the problem was and I proceeded to tell him the burger is way over cooked and had no flavor.  He said I should have let the server know that it was not cooked to my liking. I let him know that the server/bartender never came over and asked me about my food.  I told him, anyone, and I mean anyone, can cook a burger correctly the second time.  I let him know that I was not the only one here at the counter having this problem.  He apologized politely and left (mistake #4).  The bartender came back over to me and asked why I had not told him about the burger.  I let him know that I was waiting for him to ask me about the food and he argued with me that he had asked me earlier. Big Mistake #5!!!!     So my lesson that I learned here was that bartenders are bartenders and not food servers. Don't eat at the bar.  Don't eat here on Mondays, as the part time chef works on Mondays, plus the chef needs to learn the difference between, rare, medium and well done.  Gordon Ramsey Burger Restaurant gets many 4 & 5 star reviews but not from me. FIVE MISTAKES for one customer, let's see.  How many stars is that worth!  I gave it one star because I got seated right away.  After that, all downhill as they say.  Oh wait.  The bill for the burger, fries and 2 drinks was $51.96.  They gave me a nickel back, so they gave me a penny tip back!!!  I left the nickel....will I be back or eat at a Gordon Ramsey establishment again...time will tell, but not anytime soon. Thanks for listening!!!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good hamburger! We came here not knowing what to expect and were pleasantly surprised.  We both had the Hells' kitchen burger cooked medium with fries.  The meat is seasoned well and the roasted jalape√±o adds so much flavor!  Service was great for as busy as this place was (we had about a 15 minute wait at 2 in the afternoon).  Come early if you are too hungry to wait!  Our only issue was that the fries were not very good.  When a restaurant can execute a burger so well, it always makes me wonder how they can mess up french fries?? They were not crispy from the moment they hit the table.  We did enjoy the two varieties of ketchup that they were served with.  We would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Pros: -Farmhouse burger was cooked a perfect medium as ordered. Tasted so great. -Others in my party ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and they loved it. -Great service with a very knowledgeable staff.  -Fries and added sauces were great. -For Vegas, I think it was priced right.  Cons: -None   PS: Also saw Gordon Ramsey. He came in, waved at diners and seemed like a good dude.  Noted- Gordon Ramsay's surprise visit did not influence or mold my excellent review."}
{"text":"I think the name of Gordon Ramsay is the big draw. We ordered two burgers and neither was what I expected from a big name chef. The wait is also very long and the fries were disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this place. Just not worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were so excited to come back here after a year but everything was a big disappointment. The hostess was super unfriendly, the waiter didn't have enough information about the menu and finally those burgers didn't,t have a good quality like before. I,m sorry but we are not going there anymore."}
{"text":"I've been dying to go to this place for a long time but always happen to miss it when I come to Vegas. I found time this visit and I'm glad I got to go. There was a line of people waiting, but my mom went straight to the front and checked in and they have that text service where they'll just text you when your table is ready so you can walk around instead of waiting in line. So make sure you check in instead of just standing mindlessly in line!  We got a text no more than 5 minutes later that our table was ready. We walked back to the front desk and they made us wait like 15 minutes for a table to be cleaned, and they they got frustrated with my mom for standing at the desk instead of further away which was not cool. I didn't witness it but my mom said the front desk girls were super rude and gave her attitude.  After we got seated the manager came over and apologized for everything that had happened which was nice.  So my family all ordered the \"Hell's Kitchen\" burger which was AMAZING. I got the \"F Word\" burger which is actually not on the menu! They only sell 50 a day and it's pricier than the rest of the burgers at $22 instead of $15. It was good, but if I came back I would def get the \"Hell's Kitchen\" burger.  I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes but my boyfriend got those fries and he loved them. I got the truffle fries which were delish as well. The fries are like $12 so they're big enough to share between 2 people.  Overall great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is good, yet pricey-but it's in Vegas... Everyone has covered the food angle in their reviews so I am going to skip to the service. It was top notch. We came fairly late after just landing and the wait wasn't terribly long. Our server was on top of everything. A glass was never empty or even close to empty. If you enjoy good service, even at a faster pace, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger! Our waiter Alex was great! I had the Blue burger and it was cook to perfection on a tasty bun. Onion rings and fries are separate but 1 tower is perfect to share. My pick,  onion rings but fries were tasty.  Definitely worth the walk over to relax with a beer and burger!"}
{"text":"Very delicious.  Great service no wait to order. Had to wait about 15 mins for food to be made but duh it's made to order right there gourmet.  Boyfriend said best onion rings he ever had but his burger was a little too cheesy ( ultimate cheese burger) Mine (blue cheese) was very good. So much flavor.  Drinks were a little pricey but super cute and delicious and strong.  Always a server always by to help  We left full and happy"}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the wait! Excellent service and friendly!  Had superfruit antioxidant drink and WOW! Burgers are amazing and huge! Definitely add  onion rings to your meal... Love love this place!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Love the beer batter onion rings and yummy fries with truffle drizzle ! Great service"}
{"text":"$70 a bit pricey for pub food but it was really good! Enjoyed it! We got the Oreo milkshake, hog burger (great) and basic wings. The fries were also very good!"}
{"text":"Ramsay restaurant is worthy of being in kitchen nightmare. to start the staff on Monday night 4/17/17 seemed to hate their job. me and gf order. she orders the ahi sliders  ( she didn't want a regular burger. ) I order the hells kitchen burger. and we share fries.  the water is nasty..  the ahi sliders arrive about 10 minutes before my Burger. I get it's an appetizers but, the server could have realized that was my gf main course. when the burger comes they bring another plate of ahi sliders. I think \"oh cool they realized what they did and are giving us another order of sliders\" the server realized they already brought them and decided to take them back. I asked if she could just leave them with us since they are already made. she said no. I guess they are selling to let them sit until someone else orders them. 1 stars since the actual burger I got was great.   now the worst of all things. the 8 dollar fries \" just fries\" they were the most stale fries I've ever paid for. they were cold and hard to bite. I'm not picky at all when it comes to fries and was hungry. but, I just couldn't eat them..i tried..  no one ever asked how was everything so I didn't complain."}
{"text":"Are you in Vegas?  Do you like burgers?  GO HERE.  RUN.  There was always a line when we went... if you have more than two people you need to check in wtih the front desk. We waited about 25 minutes for a table for three.  Our service was great, he answered every question we had and was super knowledgable about the menu.  The food took a while, but that was a little expected since the place was packed.    The burger I had was the best burger I have ever had in my entire life.  My friend also thought the same of her burger.  This was my first Gordon Ramsay experience, and now I want to do all the others just to see if the food is this good everywhere."}
{"text":"This place is so good. There is a nice variety of burgers. The meat tastes very good. Be sure to ask the server if they are serving the anniversary burger that was great.   Make sure to read the menu and understand everything that comes with the burger. There are all kinds of cheese and spices or sauces so you have to make sure you know what you're getting.   The staff takes care of the huge line and all the people very quickly and efficiently you'll have to wait but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We had a midnight dinner here on our last night in Vegas and we're glad that we did. We were considering eating here since the first day of our trip. But every time, we turned back because of the long wait time. This place does not take reservations so there's usually a queue of people waiting to be seated. And on holidays, it can be a while before you can get in. So, we decided to check it out one last time during the trip, and thankfully, there was no queue at the time.   We ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries, the vegetarian Portobella Burger and the Hell's Kitchen Burger (replaced with a Chicken patty). The fries were good. The mushroom in the Portobella was a tad bit overpowering for me towards the end. But nevertheless, it was delicious. My husband had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. He prefers white meat to red. So, they offered to replace the patty with a Chicken patty. The Hell's Kitchen is a spicy burger. It could be a bit too hot for someone who does not eat a lot of spice. But since my husband does, he loved it.  The atmosphere is great and so is the service. We will definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"WHAT?  They changed the menu this past month and took away the jalape√±o poppers??? They figured out that their is an \"E\" in Burger so changed the name to Burger instead of Burgr.  They revamped their menu but some of the classics are still there like the farmhouse burger (my favorite) The sweet potato fries are still great and unchanged.  But come on, you can get a good burger anywhere on the strip.  The Jalape√±o poppers truly was my big draw to this place."}
{"text":"Well well for the first time in years I had a good f.....ing burger well flavor and cook perfect well season the fries touch my heart too I would recommend anyone if they in Vegas to try this place"}
{"text":"My boyfriend I went here as one of our first pit stops in Vegas the night we arrived.  We were so excited to get a Gordon Ramsey Burger and have some drinks.  First, the Manhatten that my boyfriend ordered wasn't drinkable there was so much Vermouth in it.  We sent it back and decided to go with beer....mistake too! He ordered a Brooklyn Lauger on tap and it was flat, no suds and the glass smelled.  The beer was skunk and tasted like those beers you got back in the day of HS.  Then, the burger came- was JUST ok and the onion rings were gross! To top this all off- not one drink was comp'd And bill was expensive.  Huge disappointment from a restauranteurs establishment that prides himself on quality!  I make better manhattans and burgers at home!  Bartender had no idea how to make any cocktails!  Manhatten was in a highball glass...."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for dinner. Totally underwhelmed with the food. The only thing that was really tasty were the fries. The service was excellent. Our waitress was there for us!  If Gordon actually tasted his food there, he would be cursing."}
{"text":"Decor and layout of restaurant was average. Well lit and plenty of pictures of Gordon in case you forgot where you were. Ordered the Farm Burger ($17) which included bacon, over easy egg, cheese. Overall, good service good atmosphere, good name and that's what you're paying for."}
{"text":"Poutine was great but s but salty and scant with the cheese.  We enjoyed three different burgers and all were fantastic.  Our server Alex was lovely, very informed, honest and exhibited a level of service that far exceeded expectation."}
{"text":"All I have to say, is that this place was not only cool especially with the fire display in the front of the restaurant but omg! The Hell's Kitchen burger was one of the best burgers Ive ever had! The meat was so tender and juicy, overall the burger just melted in your mouth. I couldn't stop eating it, and I normally don't finish a big meal.. but this burger...I made it a mission to eat it.. I made it a goal! And boy, I was sad once I was officially done with it because I knew it will be forever until I get this burger again.:(  It felt like I woke up from a great dream. If you are unsure on what to get from the menu.. GET THE HELLS KITCHEN BURGER!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss on food.  Can be really great, but can be really disappointing as food will end up flavorless.  Seems to be a cycle. Get one good run at it and then the next one is absolutely tasteless. The hostesses are always condescending and have an attitude.  The servers are generally pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Food was so incredible. Had the brisket nachos and ale cheese soup as well as blue cheese burger.   I want to try everything on the menu!! The waitress wasn't too friendly, but I didn't care. Food was worth it and just the beauty of the restaurant. We went mid afternoon on a week day and no wait!  Go!!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers at a reasonable price. I've never had such a delicious bun like this!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch. Nice atmosphere, didn't have to wait. Ordered the chips with curry sauce to start. Chips were very crispy but great with the sauce, we really enjoyed them. We also ordered the bangers and mash and a burger with cheese, bacon and egg. We both enjoyed our meals and I would recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries, and shakes.  Employees were incredibly friendly and attentive. Our server was excellent, he did a great job explaining everything to us and we never had to ask for anything. Our water cups were always full. He had a great personality. Their burgers are made with quality ingredients and you can taste the difference. The bun held everything together and was fresh. The meat patty was juicy and seasoned well. Their fries are also cooked to perfection. Our shakes were amazing and was a meal in itself. I highly recommend getting one and sharing it. The shake, burger, and fries was a lot. You can also share the fries too, their portions are generous. The ambiance is relaxed.   Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Order all the burgers and split them between the table.  Crazy? Stupid? Both, maybe?  We ordered the Hog, Hell's Kitchen, special F-Word and the Lobster/Shrimp. Split the burgers four ways between our party of four so we could all try each one.   None of them really stood out...we decided we all liked the hog burger the most, but we could skip this place next time we are in town.  Surprisingly, we ALL really enjoyed the poutine.  It wasn't authentic poutine, but the flavors were awesome.  That mushroom gravy...delish!!"}
{"text":"Chef Gordon Ramsey has never disappointed me. The best meal from start to finish I've ever had was at his signature steak house at the Paris resort and casino. Now I can honestly say that the best burger I've ever had in my life was here.  My picture will not do it justice, but the Farm Burger is simply awesome and definitely with every penny. While the cool fire display might bring people in, the food will keep them there.   As a burger lover, this place is a must for me every time I'm in Las Vegas now."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and ordered to go. The food came out fast! Was still hot when i received it!! It tasted amazing and the customer service was just as good!!!! Definitely recommend the truffle fries. Although they don't have bbq sauce (which i love on my burger) i didn't need it . I didn't even put any condiments because the pickles added soo much flavor ."}
{"text":"Everything was delious amd we can't wait to be here for good. Hopefully one day we will gey to meet Mr. CHEF RAMSEY hi.self soon."}
{"text":"We waited about 30 minutes for a table and it was worth every minute.   I ordered the Hells' Kitchen Burger ($15.00) and my husband decided on the U.K. Burger. ($15.00) Both of these burgers hit it out of the park. They were amazing!! Cooked to perfection!! The Hells' Kitchen was prepared with asadero cheese, roasted jalape√±os,fresh avocado, roasted tomatoes and jalape√±o pesto aioli. The U.K. had dublinar cheese, major grey's chutney and arugula.    We also tried an order of sweet potato fries. ($9.00) They were fresh and hot."}
{"text":"If you're foodie or just wish to enjoy a simple yet sophisticated burger, this is your place.  We were fortunate to be served by a waitress that worked with their restaurant from the opening. She was very informative and attentive.   Although our party of 8 weren't fortunate enough to see Mr. Gordon , we were still very content....it was all about the food.   Burgers  are simply flavorful!!  Try their truffle fries and Hell's Kitchen burger.  I'll also add, There are very few places that you notice how comfortable your seats are....this place has very comfortable seats.   Highly recommend if you're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Good burgers for the hype, pretty popping for midnight so always gonna be good vibes here! Their anniversary burger that's not on the menu is so so compared to their pork burger for those looking for pure taste."}
{"text":"Nice check in process for parties of 3 or more. Give em your number and they text an update.  The service was excellent, very personable and prompt.  The food was hardcore meh status. I ordered a chicken burger, it was dry and kinda lame. The rest of my party ordered other various burgers and quite enjoyed them! So avoid the chicken burger and you'll be fine.  Kinda pricey, but nice vibes. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. What can I say about this place. I'm a big burger fan and this was a very good burger. It's not your regular burger joint like a shake shack or a five guys but it is a higher quality place. The staff are very knowledgable and honest. I would recommend a visit to here for a one off meal. It is a bit pricier than other places but you pay for quality and quality is what you get."}
{"text":"Worst food poisoning I have ever experienced. I ate the farm burger, which was a major disappointment; I can do better at home. I ended up in the hospital because the vomiting wouldn't stop. (10/23/17) That was the only thing I ate that whole day. (No, I do not drink alcohol.) After being down for a couple days, I came back to my convention for work and found out a fellow member was sickened by Gordon Ramsay Steak the day after me becoming sick. Never will I ever eat there again!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best tasting burger, but considered  the time to prepare the food and the price I give it 3 stars. The service was excellent, waitress are very polite and friendly, one of them even show us her son video. From the time we sit down and ordered our food, took about 36 minutes, 2 Hells Kitchen burger, fries, and a soup. Drink are coming right away though, water and couple of glass of angry orchard. Total bill is $71. By the time the food came out we kinda tired and lost our appetite a little."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was excellent. It can be pricey depending on what you order and it does take time to get food but it is 1000% worth it.  Will definitely return the next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Ok sucks I have to say this but it sucked! The waiter Sergio ruined my wife's surprise 46th birthday! He was horrible! No respect no courtesy, no professionalism! When the food was served we moved and added three chairs to accommodate my cousins who where un expectedly in Vegas and the waitstaff literally threw a fit over us adding and moving chairs.  Like it was our fault!  The manager on site was informed of his employees service by my best friend of 20 years and the manager said he would handle it! My wife watched as they talked and laughed at us! I respect Gordon's reputation to service and his food but this staff ruined it for us! The manager comped our three orders of fries they forgot to serve with our food, and our server, frustrated, immediately brought out our fries and with no remorse said the chef apologizes! Not the server! Then we were ignored and arrogantly ignored! As a higher level government employee and 20 year navy veteran I have never been disrespected so horribly! The manager is a joke and a failure to Gordon's impeccable reputation! I will shit on this mans grave for the horrible way he handled the whole issue! A simple table side apology and maybe a desert for the kids would have sufficed! Get your act together and represent Hell's Kitchen as your chef so deserves! What a disgrace to me, a veteran, my friend, who thought this was a once in a life time experience, my wife who's 46th birthday is ruined, and my kids who had to watch this bullshit! Two stars only because the food was good and Gordon is my wife's favorite chef! The management is shit and the server needs to learn respect to his clientele."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  I had the original burger and it was fantastic. Service was a little slow. Waitress said they were short 5 cooks and it took 45 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"I had a mix of emotions at the beginning. I was very excited to try this place, but was very disappointed that was another open wall restaurant into the casino/hotel. For luxury restaurants, I usually expect a private restaurant experience and I feel like the open places feel too much like mall food and not enough like a luxury restaurant. But the location was great, easy to find and right on the strip.  The atmosphere on the inside was very appropriate for what it was. Thematically he was going for the American/British burger joint and it was set up that way. Large TVs with sports (which don't anything for me, but I thought was smart) and the blue and red color theme. Merchandise and photos of Ramsey made it seem more like a destination dining location and less like a luxury restaurant.  The menu was perfect. Small, to the point, and cute. It had burgers, but also offered vegetarian option for burgers which is highly appreciated, modern and makes the burger menu feel complete.  The service was good. We were seated fairly quickly, food didn't take too long to arrive, we were checked in on and my water stayed full. Nothing complain about! The food itself was played beautifully. My chicken was a bit dry. But I will say that I was very much pleased with the flavor design. The idea of the creme brule milkshake is a brilliant twist on the classic beverages! And it was delicious. My chicken sandwich made me feel like a journey to the Mediterranean and it was almost a gyro burger, but without the tsatziki sauce.  The onion rings also were great and the dipping sauces were good too."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food, well worth the 45 minute wait we had. We ordered truffle fries, hot wings and a burger that had foie gras on it, not sure what hat the name was, and it was all delicious.  Probably the best truffle fries we have ever had and the quality of the burger was top notch. I would definitely recommend this place and will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"The first time I went here was 2013 and I fell in love with this place. Food is superb and every time I come out to vegas I make sure I eat here. Suggestions: come by the time they open so you don't have to wait so before the peak of lunch time and before the peak of dinner. Just keep in mind there will always be a wait. It's a very popular restaurant. The smaller the party the better, but if you have a large group expect that you will wait a long time."}
{"text":"Went on a Wed night and was seated in 25 min. Had the farmhouse burger and onion rings. Both of them were great! It's a little pricey but your getting an amazing burger!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the service is very slow. It took one hour to get a table, then another hour to get our burger!!  Why Gordon is not applying his own rules is his own business!!   Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a hard one. Am I grading it for the food or for the experience? Eating at any Gordon Ramsay restaurants is always an experience..the decor, ambience, and crowd make everything so much more exciting. Of course, the service is amazing, even for a place that serves burgers. The burgers are reasonably priced, but the fries and onion rings are a bit expensive. I ordered the truffle fries as well as the Farmhouse burger while my wife ordered the blue cheese burger. They were both good, but is it much better than Inn and Out, √çlands, or Red Robin? I'm not so sure. At least I couldn't tell a big difference. I think Red Robin's onion rings are much better. Overall, it's still a great restaurant if you just want to eat burgers, munch on some bar foods and chill out with some friends without going out to a fancy restaurant. For #Thinsulin fans, you can eat the burgers without the buns but you'll probably want to order two if you want to be full."}
{"text":"Waaayyyyy overpriced! Burger was meh, truffle fries were not real truffle, just over cooked potatoes with nothing special. 2 burgers, 2 beers, 1 fry, 1 salad =$91.  Pro tip - go to a real burger place not a crappy hotel restaurant fancied up with that jerkface dude's name on it....people should be able to yell and fuss at him by this sub par nonsense.  Highly disappointed.   Ask a real local about better burger spots cheaper."}
{"text":"We found hair in the sauce for the fries.....forgot to take a pic since they already took it away"}
{"text":"Service was fine, burgers absolutely flawless and especially the \"F-Word\" and the \"Hells Kitchen\" were remarkable"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service. Highly recommend getting the Truffle Parmesan fries. Right near the slot machines so you get to people watch :)"}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had. The onion rings and truffle French fries are to die for. And the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"As a grown ass woman who just witnessed the glory of the Backstreet Boys Vegas comeback, it was only fitting for dinner's first course meal to be the immaculate creme br√ªl√©e Oreo milkshake at Gordon Ramsay Burger. No, sir waiter, you did not hear me incorrectly - I am requesting my non-alcoholic dessert drink to arrive, flying on a beautiful unicorn, well before my humongous burger and onion rings. Sil vous plait.   Yah. That milkshake was fan-frickin-tastic. The creme br√ªl√©e is a delicious layer resting on a creamy Oreo milkshake.   Tried the farmhouse burger - the meat was cooked to perfection, and the fried egg on top just makes everything ten times better. Sides are ordered separately at this joint, so the table ordered the Parmesan onion rings, truffle fries, and sweet potato fries. Onion rings - crispy and delicious. I was told the sweet potato fries were amazing thanks to the powdered sugar shaker they serve with it. I was told the truffle fries were meh. Everyone seemed to like the burgers they ordered.   The vibe is hip and the service was great. I hear the average wait time is 30-45 minutes, but they do text you when the table is ready so you could roam the casino in the mean time. We got there around 11 after the concert and had no wait. Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Staff were SUPER friendly. The GM was especially nice to chat with as I sat at the bar area by kitchen. Burger was good, but it was not mind blowing or worth the long wait in the line and for it to arrive. Disappointed with the fries..... a burger paired with bad fries totally brought down my review. On a brighter note, their new cocktail (cannot remember name but it was pink) was on point! Not too sweet and strong!"}
{"text":"We moved from a table to the bar after the service was taking a little long. A big burly bartender made amazing drinks. We got the Scottish egg, mini burgers and the chip nachos. All were pretty yummy"}
{"text":"The hype is real folks, this place is awesome!!! Came here for dinner to fulfill my longtime desire to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Add burgers to the mix and bam, paradise!  First off, the wait is a little disheartening. For a group of two, you wait in a line next to the hostess' booth until a table opens up. There were about 20 people and the wait was about 45 minutes long when I was there, but continued to grow and grow as the night went on. It sucks, but it's Vegas. Just suck it up!  After we were seated, I ordered the blue (yeah, not bleu) cheeseburger and a side of parmesan truffle fries. After about a 20 minute wait, it came out and it was phenomenal. The burger wasn't the absolute best I've ever had, but it was damn good!!! Definitely a top contender. It was very well put together, it wasn't sloppy, it was perfectly cooked, and a great great burger. Perfectly moist. So good. Next, the fries. Holy cow, the fries were freakin' amazing. The fries were the best I've ever eaten. Simply perfection!  Very good restaurant. A few cons, but the pros greatly outweigh them. I would come back over and over again!"}
{"text":"This place is SUPER OVER RATED.. Burgers were dry.. food was basic.. and the wait was even worse... only reason I am giving it 1 star is because of the good service we got from our waitress.."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 4 because a lot of the appetizers were spectacular, but the emphasis of this restaurant is the \"Burger\" and I wasn't too thrilled with what I had.  Sadly I wasn't able to take a photo of it but I had the Farmhouse burger. Now it didn't taste horrendous (I've had far worse), but this just didn't live up to its expectations. The bun didn't cut it for me. It tasted like it came straight out from a plastic container and they decided to brush some melted butter on it to mask the flavor.  The meat was also really dry. I didn't feel like I got my moneys worth. It was good that I experienced it, but so far all of Ramsays restaurants for me have been a hit or a miss and most of the time his appetizers are always killin it but when it comes down to the main course, it's nothing great.  To end on a brighter note, the nachos were excellent and the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I really love my burgers and walked in with the expectation that this could be an overrated celebrity restaurant with a huge line up for a disappointment and yes the line up is quite long !!! My first reaction when I saw the menue was that it was actually reasonably priced and there was a lot of original burgers with high end ingredients!  I decided to go for the forest burger as I like my classic bacon cheeseburger but this one had tremor cheese, forest mushrooms and duck bacon !  When it came out the burger looked gorgeous and the onion rings were huuuuge haven't ever seen them that size and thankfully we were sharing them!  So the burger itself did feel like it was mass produced but one of the best tasting one I have ever eaten and as for the onion rings very crispy but more then 3 would probably blow up my stomach so definitely a good dish to share. I really have to say that for lunch it's the perfect experience in Vegas! Casual, good value and fun !"}
{"text":"I am such a Gordon Ramsey fan so when I was in Vegas I had to stop here. There was a line with a wait of 30hr around 3pm Tuesday but we opted to sit at the bar which was available immediately.   We ordered the \"forest burger\" it had duck bacon my boyfriend loved it, it was an acquired taste. I ate the ' kettle chip nachos\" it was sooooooooo good. Def the short rib. I could hve just ate that. Ughhh I was mad because we we never preferred the Parmesan fries which surrounded the room. Def would hve to come back to this place just for the truffle parmasean fries.   Finally tasting his food makes me love him even more. Muah to chef Ramsey."}
{"text":"Delicious! The lines can get long, but if you put your name down, they'll text you when your table is almost ready :) I came on a Sunday night around 7:30pm and had to wait for about 45 minutes for a party of 3.   I got the:  -Farmhouse burger  -Hells kitchen burger  -Hells kitchen chicken wings    The farmhouse burger was soooo yummy. It wasn't as dynamic as the Hell's Kitchen burger, but it was simple yet delicious. There was an egg in it, which went perfectly with the bacon and meat. The egg was made perfectly... the runny yolk actually squirted out when I tried to cut the burger.   The Hell's Kitchen burger had spicy jalape√±o aoli and really just so much going on. It was delicious!!   I actually didn't like the chicken wings that much. It was pretty juicy, but I'm not a huge fan of tangy flavors so it wasn't my favorite.   The restaurant's front has a huge fire lining the wall and a 'Gordon Ramsay Burgr' sign- super cool! Gordon Ramsay's picture was everywhere hahahah  who is that again?? Some decent chef, right?! ;)"}
{"text":"A really long wait about 45-1hr. But worth it!! Burger was so delicious added truffle Fries too. It was cooked to perfection. Best burger I have ever tried coming from an enthusiast. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"I am writing this review because I am seeing negative reviews with regards to their gluten free menu. They DO have gluten free options; however like any burger restaurant the burger will be on a lettuce bun. I ate the Forest burger on a lettuce bun cooked medium well. The burger was cooked perfectly. I had never tried duck bacon before and I loved it. They also have gluten free fries. The menu is very clear about what is gluten free and what is not. I did not have a reaction and I am not gluten free by choice.   If I didn't have to eat gluten free I still would have ordered the forest burger on a glorious gluten filled bun. Either way the burger was delicious. The service is slow but it's Vegas and the restaurant was full. The line does move quickly. I recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Bar none the best server in Vegas, Alex. Not only did he make me an off the menu iced coffee, he made me three! Nice atmosphere, but Mr Ramsey, I need more cheese on that burgr!"}
{"text":"I wish we had this place in Los Angeles! We had the Hell's Kitchen burger and Blue cheese burger, both of us agreed that these were the best burgers we have ever had.  The Hell's kitchen burger jalapeno was perfectly seeded to give it some heat without it being overwhelming. The avocado was fresh and gave a great texture. Overall delicious.The blue cheese burger has a fig jam, this combination makes the burger. Blue cheese is a very salty cheese, delicious but salty; the sweet from the jam mixed with the salt of the blue cheese was heaven. I typically like thin burger patties as the heavy meat flavor can throw off the flavor balance, this was not the case, they are a thicker patty but the flavors are spot on and they were cooked perfectly. The one thing we didn't like is the truffle fries. The flavor was ok (super salty) but even the uncovered ones were lackluster; tasted frozen, not sure if they were. I came for the burger not the fries so I understand why there is a line out the door to this place. Next time I go to Vegas I will be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First off, the place was hard to find.. there are no signs and Yelp location is not accurate. The restaurant looked good but my first impression of the environment was not so good as the bad cigarettes smell of the casino was also in the restaurant. Then there was a slight wait and the hostess were wasting too much time chatting than helping customer. Once we sat down the service was friendly, but a bit too slow.. as it took at least 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered it; on top of that, they got my wife's order wrong. The only reason I gave a 2 star was because the servicer was friendly. Overall, the experience was a disappointment and my wife and I definitely will not be visiting the restaurant again. So sad because I had high expectations from a place that had Gordon Ramsey's name on it and I am a big fan of his shows."}
{"text":"I thought it was strange when the listing for Gordon Ramsay BurGR was marked as \"closed\" on Yelp. Then I find out they remodeled. But.......what was even remodeled?! Everything practically looked the same. Except for a menu change.   Yes, burgers may be expensive at $15 an order and that's WITHOUT fries. Adding a side of fries will be an additional $9-11. Get the parmesan truffle fries....yum!!!!!!! The burgers are  delicious and full of flavor. It's a perfect size, enough to make you feel full but it doesn't make you feel like a bloated person waddling outta there. You can request how well you want your burgers cooked and they're pretty on point with that. The Hell's Kitchen burger is all that I order. It's spicy with jalape√±os, cheese and avocados. Typing this is making me salivate.     Keep in mind, DO NOT come here when you're starving/hangry. Not only will you have to wait for a table since it seems like there's always a wait here. My party of 4 and I were here for dinner on a normal Thursday evening and we still have to wait about 20 minutes. So after our waitress took our orders, she informed us that the burgers will take 30 minutes to make. WHATTTTT.....30 MINUTES!?!?! Urmm....okay, that caught me off guard. Wow...patience is a virtue here at Gordon Ramsay. I mean, she gave us the option of having the fries out first so we can munch on those but we didn't wanna spoil our dinner and get full off fries. But....different strokes for different folks? *shurgs*  All in all, this burger joint is definitely a must. Much better than Shake Shack in NY NY or this burger place at Fashion Show Mall. Come here instead. I will forever be returning here for my gourmet burger fix."}
{"text":"After seeing crazy long lines at Gordon Ramsay Burger year after year, we knew we had to see what the hype was all about.  During my family's most recent trip to Vegas we finally got try their much anticipated burgers.  Overall, the dinner had some hits and misses. Despite the hustle and bustle, all the servers were all friendly, welcoming, and attentive.  We ordered many of the burgers recommended by the staff (i.e., Hell's Kitchen and Forest) as well as some others we thought just sounded delicious (i.e. Ultimate, Hog, Portobello). My favorites were the Ultimate and Portobella.  Both were bursting with flavor and cook to perfection. I would definitely order these two again. The other burgers left me unsatisfied.  The Forest was overall very bland. The duck bacon was flavorless and chewy and meat was unfortunately overcooked (based on how I wanted the burger cooked).  The Hog just had too much going on so it was difficult to appreciate all the ingredients.  Although the burger was definitely huge and filling! Hell's Kitchen tasted good but was under seasoned.  For sides we ordered the fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. The onion rings were AMAZING. They were seasoned well and had a perfect crispy batter.  Both fries were pretty average.  They were not very crisp or seasoned.I was not a fan of the homemade sauces. I was in need for good ol fashion Heinz Ketchup. Overall, I had a good experience but I was just hoping for more consistency throughout their menu."}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas, we were in the mood for a burger and decided to give this place a try. We've passed by it before and the line always deterred us from going. We had some time to spare so we decided to try. We did wait in line for about a half hour before being seated. They had a opening at the chef's table so we took that spot. We both tried the ultimate cheeseburger which was very tasty. With the burger, we ordered fries and onion rings. Both of which were fantastic. It did take about 30 minutes for the burgers to arrive which the waiter did advise us. I suggest ordering the onion rings or an appetizer before the burgers come out like we did.   If you have some time to spare to wait in line, I highly recommend trying Gordon Ramsay Burger."}
{"text":"Chegamos em tr√™s as 17:00 hs para comer. Restaurante 70% vazio. Antes de nos levar a mesa mostraram o menu e pediram para confirmarmos se realmente quer√≠amos comer. Ap√≥s confirmarmos disseram que t√≠nhamos que sentar no bar. N√£o conseguimos comer. A estrela √© pela recep√ß√£o e atendimento. Quanto a comida nao consegui provar."}
{"text":"Medium rare burgers came out well done. Brown in center and no juices. Tasted dry. Manager comped meal though as we had no time to wait for a remake. House made ketchup wasn't that great, watery. Where's the Heinz?"}
{"text":"The Blue cheese burger was delicious. Lots of flavour. I thought the parm truffle fries could have had more truffle flavour. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in the change in the menu. Less selection than what there was 4 years ago. Sat at the bar since I was by myself. The bar tender (Robert) was less than attentive and doesn't remember an order. Doesn't know the menu either, when asked what is in one of the menu items, he couldn't recall. As a professional bartender one of the BIGGEST skills needed is the ability to mingle with the clientele, to start and carry on conversations to help pass the time and also entertain a little. For some reason the ART of suggestive selling to help guide the guest through an experience has been lost.  I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger Medium Rare (The only way to order a burger)at 17:45(according to the time on the ticket) delivered at 18:19 (time on my phone when it arrived)wow what a long time. It was cooked to Medium Rare+ (just on the outside cusp of Medium Rare edging towards Medium). The flavor profile was somewhat bland with the exception of the mild heat from the roasted jalape√±o and roasted tomato. The beef had absolutely no flavor. The fries were warm (not hot) and quickly cooled to a spongy soft potato. The flavor of salt and herb quickly disbursed. No follow up to insure the meal was prepared to satisfaction nor was a follow performed for either of the two guest sitting next to me.  The 2 guest sitting next to me were also displeased with their experience as we entered into a conversation about their experience after I spoke up and mentioned an incident to a bartender (explained below). I informed a bartender that the guest to my left burger was over cooked and the bartender seemed dumbfounded and when I explained what a medium temperature should look like the bartenders response was \"I don't know, I'm just a bartender\". Wow - that really sealed it for me. My experience was ruined.. A moment later the guest was asked if they wanted to have the manager come by.(WOW really!! There should be NO question there a manager should have been informed immediately without asking anyone)  To add insult to injury, when a different bartender uses a bar towel to wipe his head and then leave the towel for future use on the bar that kind of turns my stomach. When I confronted that bartender his reply was (I wasn't using it) then I explained that he had JUST wiped down the back bar top with that very same towel  he just turned, shook his head in disapproval and said OK and took the towel and put it away.   Overall, this experience was disappointing and only confirmed by the disappointment with 2 other guests dinning at the same time. It is obvious that Mr. Ramsey no longer is involved in this concept and the company that now owns the restaurant is milking the name for all they can. Overpriced drinks ($15 for a cocktail), poor quality of product and execution along with a poor service level brings this experience to a close.  I was SO looking for a great experience like the one I remembered from years past. Unfortunately that didn't happen. It causes concern for my next experience coming up Ramsey's Prime Steak House (I have reservations in a couple of days).."}
{"text":"It bums me out having to write this review because my expectations of this place were super high.   It was 10 min from the time that we got sat before our server came to introduce herself to us. She came over and asked if we were ready to order, my husband needed some more time, so she said she would come back. She could've easily taken our drink order but she never asked. When she came back, took our order, then at that time she asked us what we wanted to drink. It seemed odd due to the fact that everywhere we go, we get asked what we want to drink before anything else. Anywho, we never saw that server again, a younger gentleman came out with our appetizers and sat them down, it wasn't until shortly after that our drinks came out...   The food was okay. We ordered the Kettle Chip Nachos, it was a little disappointing with the small about of shredded short rib it had! I'm pretty sure I would've been able to count the shreds of beef on these chips. We ordered some fries for our 2 year old to eat and they were so hard and tasteless, she gave up after 2 bites and would shake her head no when we offered her some more. This little girl eats crayons and she refused to eat these fries.    Next up was our burgers. I ordered the Ultimate Cheeseburger, it come with different kinds of cheese and just the meat. My son ordered the Backyard burger, just a basic burger and my husband ordered the Hog Burger. These were actually pretty good. They aren't served with any sides so we ended up ordering some beer battered onion rings, but just like the drinks... these didn't come out until later, way later.   Basically, service needs to improve. All food should come out at once except for the appetizer, don't bring out the side to my burger when I'm half way thru with it, at that point don't being me anything at all. We found out that the server never came back to our table because she got sent home, there was no introduction to the person that was going to be taking over her section. Really? And on top of this bad service, I'll still expected to tip 18 %  I don't think we'd come back, we have reservations for Hell's Kitchen in a couple of weeks, hoping that it will be a much better experience."}
{"text":"Credit fraud.  That's what happened when I dined at Gordon Ramsey burger in April 2018.  Our waiter overcharged a pre-paid Visa card, and kept some of the cash to himself.  A $90 dinner for three has turned into a $320 dinner.  It's been 7 days since I alerted management to this situation and have not had anything credited back.  Check your bill and do not pay with a card!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Thats all i can say about the burgers!! Soooooo good!! Service was eh ok i guess but the food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try the burgers here, I mean cmon! It is Gordon Ramsay! The service was awesome, and food came out quick, unfortunately, the food did not wow'd me.  We had the following:  - Beer Battered Onion Rings - parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip - typical onion rings, nothing out of the ordinary or anything  - Mushroom Poutine - gravy, duck bacon, cheese curds, vinegar pickles - flavors were good, but a little too salty.  Since the mushroom was the medium for this dish, it did not mellow out the flavors well  - Truffle Parmesan Fries - your basic truffle parm fries  - Farmhouse Burger - dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon, fried egg - I was highly disappointed in the burger, the bread was amazingly cold and dry.. the works inside were good though..  Maybe I went on an off day?  Hopefully I did, I do want to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Very good burger. Got the \"Hell's Kitchen Burger\" cooked well. You can actually taste the meat, not smothered in ketchup and mustard like most burgers.  Every bite is flavorful. Getting good food for the price! And really.. not that spendy. Had it inside planet Hollywood, was not disappointed! Highly recommend trying it out. Between Gordans, burger, steak, and fish + chips you can't go wrong. Skol vikes"}
{"text":"5 stars to the burger! The burger was so delicious. Delicious meat. Delicious cheese. The \"just fries\" were $8 and nothing beyond less than ordinary. I could have made them better at home. The server was an a$$h*** and couldn't even deliver regular ketchup. Only chipotle ketchup that tasted terrible. This is American food. Get some regular ketchup. Server said I'm just not used to it. No salt and pepper within reach. The server was rude to his trainee in front of customers. He had a bully attitude. Server asked me how I want my burger done then tells the customer next to me that the burgers only come one way. Inconsistency. The fries were stale and chewy. The servers name is Robert at the bar. Attitude problem from *ell.  He automatically judged me for being in my 20s and told me if I don't have money walk up and down the strip and do nothing with my time. Very rude and unprofessional. I understand it's Vegas but coming from the perfectionist Gordon Ramsey cmon now. The server is what made the experience beyond terrible. I would've ignored the terrible fries had I had A+ service."}
{"text":"Appetizers and fries were very good (nachos, onion rings, sweet potato fries and truffle fries). Burger came out medium rare vs the medium I ordered. Not sure if that's common but my table of 8 had the same comments about their orders as well. I advise you to check with your server before ordering. Service was excellent which is why this wasn't a 3 or less. Would go back and try again, making sure that I get the burger cooked to my preference."}
{"text":"Had the Impossible burger for the first time!  It was amazing!   I wouldn't expect anything less from GR!  I love seeing a vegetarian and vegan option at his place!  Long wait but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is all hype! My wife had the $26 lobster and shrimp burger, I had a blue cheese burger, honestly I've had better burgers at super duper. I wouldn't waste my time going here again, we should have eaten at Pink's"}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, so I had to try this place. I had a plane to catch an hour later so I took it to go, I think the experience inside would've been better. They took about 45 minutes that day when promised around 30 minutes for a to go order (anxiety)! Regardless they were nice and didn't seem bothered when we kept checking in on them.   The burgers were about $15 a pop, which isn't too bad, I've seen worse! I got the hell's burger. Medium well, my friend got it well done and it was very dry! It was tasty! Had all the right things inside for my liking!   The truffle fries and sauce they used on them were amazing, get those with extra sauce!   This place was good, I would definitely go back and try out some other things the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey really likes himself, his face and name is plastered on everything here, but he has a lot to be proud off. We came for dinner with a group of six, surprised to learn that large parties are given priority seating. Our waiter was very efficient and skillfully described the menu, including the special off the menu burger for the day. Everybody choose a different burger and everybody loved their selection. I shared with a friend and got to try the fish and chip burger as well as the farmhouse burger. Can't pick a favorite because both were on point and absolutely delicious. No one left anything on their plates.  We even ate all three orders of truffle fries and sweet potato fries.  I am glad I choose a very healthy (lol,not really) cocktail to wash it all down. This dinner felt like a splurge but was very reasonable. Burger prices ranged from $18-$25, which is very inexpensive for this quality and ambiance in Vegas. Thanks, Gordon."}
{"text":"Can't wait till my next trip to Vegas to eat the Hog burger  I wish Gordon had a location in LA that served the Hog burger  Service was great"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean, and the servers were pleasant enough, but just try to get a water refill. I dare you! A weird guy kept hovering, who wasn't our waiter, but rather than fill our drinks, he just gave the awkward look and kept moving. I made my husband stop him, finally because most of our glasses were empty.  I think Gordon forgot to heed his own advice because I ordered Hell's Kitchen burger, because I like spicy. Well, if it says \"Hells Kitchen\", it  really should be spicy. Nope. The bun to burger ratio is sad. We named the buns Sir Mix A Lot buns, because baby got back. Too big for the tiny patty. Speaking of patty, where was it?!?! I thought it would be handmade and/or big and juicy. No, no and no! Such a disappointment! One and done. I pulled the top of the bun off, for the picture or you wouldn't be able to see anything."}
{"text":"WoW went here Excited and was let down .. the service here was bad , everyone in red and grey shirts or blue and grey were more interested with socializing with eat each then getting the food out.. there was constant orders waiting while they stood around and talked . You can see the order up in the kitchen and they just constantly sat there it was so bad and I was really let down. If my name was on this place there would be a big overhaul."}
{"text":"If you like burgers, you might love this place. I thought it was overpriced and not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect.  It's Gordon Ramsay!  I will say that my burger, the Forest Burger was exceptional.  However, she ordered the Farmhouse Burger and she ordered it cooked medium but it came much closer to rare, the fried egg was supposed to be over medium and it was over hard.  But she says it was still an awesome burger.  The Mushroom Poutine appetizer was to die for!!  It was very busy and the service was about average.  Would I come here again?  Definitely!!"}
{"text":"Really this should be five stars for the food and one star for the front staff. Had to come back a second day just to get in because the wait time was hour and a half at 10:30 at night! Not going to wait that long that late even for Ramsey food! We did get a txt in half an hour but had gone elsewhere. How could they be that far off?!? Anyway, second try same dumb staff out front who could barely understand simple questions! Geez! If Ramsey knew you know what he would say! Food worth all the bother. Totally memorable! I will never look at a burger again without thinking of the one I had. Cooked to perfection. Truffle fries were incredible. I will come back again. If you go, go before 5PM. We had practically no wait with a party of 3."}
{"text":"Bomb burger and a great time with my wife.  Our server was great and the food met our G.R. expectations.  Only thing we didn't enjoy was the jalepeno ketchup.  Did not taste like jalepeno at all.  It tasted oddly like carrots which was weird.  I would definitely return for another burger :)"}
{"text":"We were eventually seated and our waitress came over and sat at our table with us to take our order. We received our hummus which was very good and then she came to sit with us again and take our order.  When my wife ordered Med Rare she asked if she's good with red? She said yes and then I ordered and I said would like M R also. They brought out the burgers and truffle fries which were good but underwhelming.  I then took a bite and realized my burger was not just well done but well well done. I asked my wife about hers and she showed me her well done burger. I was in shock since we watch every show that Gordon does and couldn't believe they couldn't get the cook right. Our waitress or I should say order taker took them back to the kitchen. We tried not to eat the fries but figured they would only get cold. The manager brought our burgers back, set them down and asked us to cut into them to make sure they were right. He didn't apologize or say anything about the error and it felt like we were being unreasonable to ask that it be cooked properly. Then he started small talk \"what brought you here\" etc and said he is the manager if we needed anything. The whole situation was very strange. The burgers were the best burgers we've ever had but would not go back there for all the other nonsense. Thought maybe they would comp a drink or something but should have figured.  We have been to Gordon Ramsay Steak and had the best food and service you can imagine."}
{"text":"Literally best burger ever! The onion rings are SO good. Would drive 4 hours just to go there. Definitely a must when in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Wow, rock solid burgers. Went with a party of 6 and all of us loved the food. The onion rings and fries were really good as well. It's Vegas so yes the place is busy but if you're craving a great burger this place has them."}
{"text":"OH boy can you say that this place is the BOMB! Since I have been to Gordon's Steak House I vowed on my next visit to Vegas that I would come to this place. First and foremost I want to thank the new GM Laurence from Gordon't Steak House for arranging a table for my family and I will forever be grateful for it was perfect.  Gordon Ramsay Burger is located in Planet Hollywood which is right next to Paris. This location is on a first come first serve bases. When we went to the counter to announce our arrival we were greeted with a very welcoming smile and they informed us that they were expecting us and they were preparing our table. As  we awaited the few minutes for them to finish preparing our table we had a chance to review the menu which was in Gordon's style; simple and elegant.   In the front of the restaurant there was a bar with several TV's for watching current sporting events for those who wanted to enjoy some appetizers with their drinks. As we were brought to our table we were seated in a lovely blue colored booth with the traditional Ramsay white table setting. My brother was amazed by the weight of the cutlery, which I love a nice balanced fork and knife. Our waiter Jared was just amazing, he answered some of questions about the various types of hamburger's that were offered on the menu. Jared also informed us that they had a special F Word burger that was not on the menu and of course you knew I was going to have exactly that. I also informed Jared of my allergies to shellfish and nuts, which he had made a special note so that the staff would be informed to use equipment that were not used with any products that could cause an allergic reaction.   Some the of things we ordered along with our main dishes was a delicious Cesar salad with green apple slices minus the kale, I am not a kale fan. We also ordered regular fries and the truffle fries with parmesan cheese. The funny thing is that the pictures makes these fries look small but they are actually fairly big and even with 3 of us we could not finish all the fries. The nice served with different sauces too and came out hot and crispy golden.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very relaxing and it has this wonderful wavy fire wall display. The temperature in the restaurant was perfect, yes I am one of those people that get cold easy lol so things like this are very important to me. Jared was very attentive and informed us that our special burgers will take about 20 minutes and I do appreciate that he served all our burgers along with the fries at the same time and they were all nice and hot. We were able to enjoy our dinner and Jared was very attentive by removing dishes that were not needed anymore and keeping our drinks constantly filled. If we were not so stuffed we would have ordered one of their delicious desserts but again the 3 of us shared a salad and fries and we all had our own individual burgers and we were stuffed.   I wish I could describe how delicious this burger was but I have to let the picture speak for itself.  I know that there is no doubt that I will come back here again and I would hope they still offered the F Word burger. If you have a list of things to do in Vegas then put this on your list for you will not be disappointed. Everything is well thought out and you may think 23.00 for a burger? Well it is one of the best damm hamburgers you will ever have I can promise you that."}
{"text":"Perfect Burger is Ramsay burger. Nice interior with fire and it looks modern and it's just a burger place shouldn't expect anything else. We tried Tandoori Chicken Burger and Lobster & shrimp burger. Lobster & Shrimp which is a specialty burger which is worth 25$ too pricey but worth the penny. They don't serve any fries with the burger. I tried onion rings they were a bit salty. The tandoori burger was good they made the filling paneer or tofu, cucumber, and some lettuce. Pretty good place to try on the strip."}
{"text":"Although the food was up to par, but the wait for our food was nearly an hour...Even with the understanding of this being gourmet burger and all, over 1.5hr to eat a burger and some overpriced parmesan sprinkled fries was not pleasant to say the least.. they must be slaughtering the moo moo back in the kitchen to take this long to make burger.. come on now, i've had much more complex dish that come out half the time. Ramsay needs to get his butt in this store to figure what type of time waste his business is causing. BTW thanks for saving me the trouble of eating your dessert, which took another 30mins to come out. Ended up cancelling the damn thang~"}
{"text":"We dined here Friday night around 1130 pm. Our server was very attentive and polite. He did a great job and we appreciate that.   We tried the backyard burger, ultimate cheeseburger, and the Hog burger.  The backyard burger had great flavor. A little over done but tasted great The ultimate cheeseburger was a bit of overload. But still tasty. The hog burger was pretty damn good. Lots of pork and the onion straws gave it a nice crunch. No complaints on the burgers. Our only complaint was our fries. They were cold. We were starving so we ate our burgers and left most of our fries. Other than the fries we enjoyed our food.   Tip: do not sit on the wall where the banquette is. It is extremely uncomfortable and not padded well. By the end of the meal my back was sore. As was my daughters."}
{"text":"Delicious  the burgers are to die for and the sweet potato fries are the best ever! The dipping sauces are unlike anything you will find anywhere and all of them are amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of burgers but this place was bombbbb. Got the UK burger and it wasn't too big but definitely filling. I'm very critical of the bun in burgers but the bun was nice and soft. Surprisingly, it wasn't $37293739 so I'd say it was well worth the price.   Came on a Monday morning right when it opened so there was no line."}
{"text":"Burger was delicious. Fries were delicious. Service is great!! Can't wait to go back again the next time we are in town. Not the best burger I've had but it was still really good."}
{"text":"This is my hands down favorite burger spot. Every time we make it to Vegas, we make a stop here. Well worth the money spent. The whole time I didn't have to worry about asking the waiter to refill my drink since they always had someone deliver a new Arnold Palmer when it had less than a 1/4 of a glass left. This place is exceptional on service and quality."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. The beef was delicious, the cook perfect, and the tomato, homemade ketchup, and bun were tasty. The sweet potato fries were a nice blend of sweet and salty, I loved that they were coated with powdered sugar. Add to that, the beer selection was great, and service was fast and friendly. The only downside was that it was a bit hard to find, and really loud, but I'm sure that most places in Vegas seem that way for first timers! I would definitely recommend coming here if your craving a good burger."}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing we ordered hells kitchen and forest burger yummy!! Service was good he was very knowledgeable and explain things really well.  In addition, my son ordered an oreo shake and it was so good because it had creme brulee on top of it.  Definitely a must go if you haven't.  #firsttimers"}
{"text":"Service was great, venue was clean and fun. There is definitely a wait if you come at peak hours. A member of our party was able to bypass the line for us, however.   The burgers are delicious. We all thought the the bun to meat ratio was a little off- but that is just personal preference."}
{"text":"Like burgers and WAITING?? Then look no further.   We decided to visit Vegas on a whim. Also we wanted to eat at a \"celebrity chef\" restaurant. Btw Gordon Ramsay has like 4 restaurants on the strip. We figured we would give Chef Ramsay's burger place a shot.   We came on Monday night and there was no wait for a table. But according to the server sometimes the wait is two hours!! I ordered the UK burger which had arugula, Dubliner cheese and a mango chutney. I prefer my burger or meat to be close rare. The server asked how I would like my burger I told her MEDIUM RARE BUT MORE RARE. She took my order and my hubby's and friends' orders. My friend wanted to modified or substitute an item. The server was nice about it but she did explain that the chefs are picky about modifications they usually DO NOT do stuff like that. But she would ask anyway and the chefs refused. So orders were finally placed. We waited 30 MINUTES!! Still NO burgers in sight!!! We asked our server about our food. She said it's a standard 30 minutes. She could tell we were irritated. She felt that management should post it somewhere but of course they wouldn't!!  Our food finally came out 5 minutes later.   The burgers and fries (btw everything is al la carte) looked good. We were starving too!! My girlfriend order her burger medium. When I cut into my burger my patty was medium well. My girlfriend's burger was more rare and she ordered medium! I was upset!! Not only did we wait 30 MINUTES plus, the chefs DID NOT ALLOW CUSTOMIZED BURGERS and this place's speciality is burgers and they STILL COULDN'T get it right!!!! The burger had good flavor but the patty was OVER COOKED and DRY to me. For almost $20 this burger should be magically! It's was the cheese and chutney that saved it.   I told the server my issue of my overcooked patty. And of course when you're a vegetarian YOU HAVE TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE WORLD!! I don't know why the server felt it was necessary to tell me she doesn't have issues with overcooked meat because she's a VEGETARIAN!!! *hand clap* very helpful you millennial! I told her I didn't want to wait 30 minutes again because I was hungry. I asked her what can she do for me. So she said she would check with her manager. She returned and gave us 10% off the bill. Thank you millennial vegetarian working at a burger joint! *thumbs up*  SUMMARY  PROS: the mango chutney  CONS: LONG wait for just the food, self righteous vegetarian server, OVERCOOKED DRY PATTY  LAST THOUGHT: Chef Ramsay would shame this restaurant and staff! Never returning!"}
{"text":"Daniel is awesome and the team is incredible.  Couldn't ask for a better experience!!!  Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Worth every penny! Get there early the lines are long because everyone wants a Gordon Ramsey burger!!  Mine was spectacular & I devoured it quickly. With so many choices at such high prices it was nice to see a high end Chef serve up burgers. Just because it Las Vegas doesn't mean you have to have caviar"}
{"text":"In regards to burgers and appetizers, this is the best I have ever had in my life. We started it off with the chips, the chicken wings, and the ahi sliders. The wings did not have too much flavor, a very basic staple, but were perfectly cooked. The chips had the best cheese with a carrot garnish that totally complimented the starter and wrapped all the flavors together. But the ahi sliders were the best thing I have ever tasted, anywhere. If you eat fish at all, this is a must have. It is truly incredible, so much flavor. For my entree I had the lobster and shrimp burger. This was exactly how I would imagine a seafood burger and so much more. Perfect everything. On top of that, the service was absolutely exceptional, the best I ever experienced, anywhere. Gordon does not mess around. Five stars across the board."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers that I have ever had in my LIFE! Believe the tails of Las Vegas, you will never forget it. There are so many flavors that were going on in my mouth, not a party but a riot! Mind blowing bbq flavor and after eating this density of a burger you will say yes to a light walk! Now let's not ask for the check before,....you guessed it finishing that great paired beer. Blue moon was the one with this one. An IPA too hoppie for a burger this dense. Burger was the pork burger wrapped in bacon (you already know my weakness) topped with pulled pork. The pork butcher deluxe is what I call it! Gordon, your welcome.   Keep it fresh and clean (hands that is) with a cut down the middle. Sit back take it in...1...2...3 NOW ask for the check and treat yourself to a walk on the strip maybe a little gamble dessert at the blackjack table followed by a nap.   Overall, you can't go wrong with this place just get in before dinner time 5pm because it gets crowded. Don't forget, TYS, always!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food. I had the Farmhouse Burger, fries, and onion rings. The ketchup was so good. Everything was delicious. Even the desserts!!!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving three stars as I am a huge Hell's Kitchen fan. The stars were how long it took to get our food by the time we sat down and hardly any alcohol in our drinks.We sat down at 7:00pm April 26th and received our food at 7:55pm. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. The flavors were there but mostly bun needed more meat. My mom order a burger with mushrooms and she loved it. The truffle fries were greasy and not my favorite truffle fries. They were on the thick side and just absorbed all the grease. The flavors were there, I think the fries sat too long before coming to our table. I and my mom ordered two cocktails(cannot remember the exact name) pineapple juice, rum and midori sour. What the cocktails were lacking was a balance between alcohol and juice. We paid $12.00 each for nothing but Juice. I already sent one drink back the Moscow Mule because it tasted like medicine. I  had drinks at Gordon Ramsay Steakhouse and I was hoping the same quality. I have ate at all of the LV Gordon's Ramsay restaurants and this will be my last visit here. I did take the survey at the table and when asked to speak with a manager I opted out. The reason I was so irritated with how long it took to get our food that I just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Get there before dinner otherwise you'll be waiting in line to get in. The burgers are very well prepared, the service was probably the best i've experienced and the only reason why it's a 4 star is because everything is sold separate. The burgers and fries are sold separate with the burgers being about $15-$20 and the fries are $8-12 which is ridiculous and they're small and not special.   nevertheless, I recommend if you don't mind paying the extra bucks for the fries."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks but really amazing food!   We tried the wings(topped with shaved carrot and fresh blue cheese).... best wings to date especially in VEGAS. Duck and cow burgers were great topped and trimmed perfectly.  Truffle fries knocked me out with greatness.     The hotdog which cost $18 was thee best hot dog and $18 dollars spent in VEGAS!    I am a annual visitor in Las Vegas and i always stop here regardless.       The only con is the looooooooong wait for a table."}
{"text":"Goood f***in BURGRs!  After a long day of starving and drinking at a pool party this was the perfect carb and protein boost at 5pm! Tried their tandoori chicken burger, Hell's Kitchen burger and truffle fries! Truffle fries  Hell's Kitchen Burger  Tandoori Chicken Burger   The chicken was really tender! But it didn't do any justice to the name. The taste didn't really hit the spot and it didn't really give the punch of a tandoor! Would say it's something that you can try once to judge it for yourself.  But for a die hard lover of Real Tandoori Chicken, this was a slight let down."}
{"text":"The most amazing Lobster burger ever!!! My husband and I ordered the cheddar soup kind of salty but still good.Then sweet potatoe fries that came w powdered sugar and a dip soo good as well.Finally, it came out Lobster burger and the curry shrimp salad.Took a bite of the Lobster all kinds of flavors in my mouth it was fabulous!!!!!! Going back next time and we both are going to get the Lobster burger,can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"Skip the burger, get the truffle fries DIP!  Have you ever seen that meme where Gordon Ramsay slaps two piece of bread around a persons face and makes them admit they're an idiot sandwich? That's how I felt after I tried two burgers: like an idiot who paid $20 per burger.   We waited for an hour before being seated. The line was frustrating because every time we peeked inside there were available tables that were clean and ready. Not sure what they were waiting for since the cutlery and napkins were already set.  ANYWAYS - we got the burger with goat cheese/arugula and the one with foie gras. Both were (and I hate to say this because I had such high expectations): underwhelming. The burgers were cold and I did not taste the melding nor complimentary nature of ingredients.   The highlight of the dinner was the truffle fries dip. I asked for an extra helping and was pleasantly surprised when there wasn't an extra charge. I used everything (burger, crust, fries) as a vehicle and excuse to enjoy the truffle dip. SO GOD DAMN GOOD that it raised this rating from a 1 to 2*."}
{"text":"This is my first Gordon Ramsay restaurant and let's say I was expecting a bit more, but still enjoyed my experience overall. We decided to each order a burger and share so in case we wanted more, we knew what we would order. We ordered: The Hog Burger: surprise burger of the group, as my party and I didn't expect much because our waitress sold us on the special burger (\"F Word\") on our particular visit. This is layers on layers of pork, it isn't wasn't saturated in grease, and it was quick flavorful. All of the flavors mended well together and was the surprise \"favorite\" pick amongst us (party of 4). Being as hungry as we were, we decided to try Chef Ramsay's take on poutine. It was winner for us as we enjoyed the mixture of gravy, duck bacon, cheese curds, and vinegar pickled shallots. My friend even said on her next visit, maybe she'll just have an order of this by herself. It satisfied our taste buds and piqued our interest on what else was coming our way. Shrimp and Lobster Burger: had a nice texture and though I liked the curry that seasoned the patty, I felt like it muted the shrimp and lobster flavor (as we know those aren't prominent to begin with). Still a pretty good burger, but I felt it could have been better. Hell's Kitchen Burger: had a subtle kick to it from the jalepeno ingredients, but wasn't overpowering. The avocado did help quell the heat and add another flavor profile to the burger itself. I would say this was the second best burger of the group. \"F Word\" Burger: this was the special (off menu) during my visit, which is constructed with a patty that is a blend of a 27-day, dry-aged New York strip, ribeye and barbecue short rib. It's topped with frisee, pickled shallots and lemon vinaigrette. Though sold as soon as we heard the ingredient list of this bad boy, we felt like all the flavors were not pronounced enough, but was still a good hunk of a burger. We noticed all the beef patties were consistently good (they have that process down) and the difference on the beef burgers were just the toppings/condiments associated with each \"specialty\"."}
{"text":"I along with a couple friends thought we would try this restaurant back in March. Fortunately the wait during a busy weekend was not to bad, about fifteen minutes. Once we were seated the waiter approached the table and promptly asked if we wold like to order anything to drink. We chose not to order any alcohol and simply ordered waters and soft drinks. It was very obvious from the waiters demeanor that since we did not order any alcohol this was going a low ticket table and assumed his tip would reflect that. Never assume! The burgers were about average, good but nothing to rave about.   The little things are what made the difference. When our burgers were brought to the table they came in stages, not all together. Once we received the burgers it took about ten additional minutes for the fries to arrive. Why is the table not served together? Toward the end of the meal one of my friends finished his burger before the rest of us. His plate was clear while we were still eating. Is this common practice to start clearing the table before all the patrons are still eating. It made us feel as though they were trying to push us out the door quickly so they can get the next party seated asap. Maybe they were going to order alcohol to jack up the tab.  Overall, our expectations were much higher and under delivered from a Gordon Ramsay establishment. I've eaten at Chef Ramsay's restaurant in London a few times and always received exceptional service. I know you can't really compare fine dinning to burgers but some sort of consistency would be great."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a work thing. The wife and I, being fans of the shows, thought we would try it. The burgers were sensational. The service was great(unlike our Gordon Ramsay Steak experience), the truffle fries were good but not what they could have been. Could hardly taste the truffle oil. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"The burger was great but the service did not come close to the expectations of a restaurant with Gordon Ramsey in the name."}
{"text":"Hell's burger was awesome with nice blend of mushroom patty ,jalape√±o and avocado. AMAZING Taste"}
{"text":"Hella kitchen burger is really good, has a great kick with the jalape√±os. I also got the kettle nachos but it was drowned in sauce, made it sauggy and too rich for me. I wish i tried the hog burger. Overall good service and iconic spot to visit."}
{"text":"If it's a Gordon Ramsay-owned restaurant, you know it'll be good."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure exactly where in Planet Hollywood the restaurant was but we found it after walking around the casino a little. Waited in line for an hour but man it was so worth it. I got the Forest Burger and shared the Truffle Fries. Wow it was so amazing. The service was surprisingly really good as well which is surprising due to how busy they were. Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here. Wonder why no other info or pictures, because we ate good food too fast. The food here is good, it's always good, thats all I have to say about that.   This trip we ordered the hog burger, yummy, crown burger yummy, uk was ok, farmhouse burger yummy. We also ordered onion rings, super yummy. The  fries are ok but I'm not into this restaurants  fries, but the dipping sauces that come with it are good though. The sweet potato fries are okay, my girls like them a lot.   Overall, I will continue to come back when I'm in Vegas, as often as possible. I have nothing but good things to say about this Gordon Ramsay Burger."}
{"text":"Flipping amazing! Not too expensive, everything is delicious. Everything is gourmet, cold beer on tap, great staff,right in the middle of the strip.  Definitely recommend if your in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had the Farmhouse burger and Ale Dawg. Both were amazing. The burger was juicy and the dawg not greasy at all. Waitress was super helpful and never let thedrink glass go empty."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after seeing it on a worth it episode on buzz-feed. There was around a 40 minute wait. The waiter was nice. I ordered the mushroom poutine and the onion rings for appetizers. My table had also ordered the U.K. burger, the patriot burger, the hells kitchen burger and the crown burger. The poutine was very good, i would highly recommend. But the onion ringer were terrible and very oily. All the burgers were very good, but the waiter did mess up my order and brought a different burger. After notifying them of the mistake they brought my burger about 10 minutes later and they took it off the bill. All together a good experience."}
{"text":"I have to say, it's a bit over-rated.  Every time we walked by, there's a long line, so we assumed the food must be damn good.  As a result, we decided to check this out at non peak time so that we didn't have to wait as long.  Our wait indeed wasn't that long but the food disappointed us. We ordered: Farmhouse burger: bacon and patty a bit dry lobster&shrimp burger:  delicious!!!  The best of all we ordered.   backyard burger: dry onion rings: good but nothing to rave about and hellsfire wings:  dry and soggy.  Should have skipped it.   Service was great except for one hostess.    Good thing we didn't have to wait long for a table.  Would probably stick to Bobby burgers instead."}
{"text":"Ordered the HogBurger , Hell's Kitchen burger with a side of Ahi Tuna Sliders and Truffle Parmesan Fries... food finally arrived after an hour wait.   Trust me it wasn't worth it.  The burgers were oily and bland...sadly there wasn't any Sriracha on the table to give the burger some taste.  Fries barely had any hint of truffle flavor... McD's fries are better:)  The pushy photographer was not appropriate for the dining experience. I would not be going back again."}
{"text":"This takes burgers to another level.  Unique toppings like duck bacon, arugula.  They also serve salads and some ribs.  Good looking appetizers.  Try the truffle fries with an awesome dipping sauce.  They also have a pork burger and portobello mushroom burger.  Prices comparable for the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"I came here with zero expectations. I had just thrown three jack and cokes at the dome-piece (courtesy of NGINX during Re:Invent), and needless to say I had worked up quite a sweat hiking down from the Venetian. My point is that I was buzzed in a number of ways but I am still confident that my culinary judgement was clear.  I sat at the bar, slammed two pints of Las Vegas's finest tap water, and had my order taken before five minutes had passed by. I ordered the Forest Burger (tremor cheese, seasonal forest mushrooms, arugula, duck bacon). I list those ingredients because they are the only thing that brought life to this burger. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare, and received a dry overcooked piece of meat that would have sent Gordon Ramsay himself straight to the kitchen to tell the cook it was \"as f***ing dry as a camel's a**hole in a desert storm\". Yeah, that's a real quote.   The toppings were stellar but the tasteless patty and sub-par meat quality are going to weigh this down to three stars. Watch out for the $8 up-charge for fries, yoinks!"}
{"text":"Just go, don't overthink it! This place has an absolutely perfect management, great food, and reputable service. The menu is simple, food is high-end and the service is fast.... and if they ask you if want  dessert say yes and go for the milkshake, do not say you are too full, there is always room for great delights. This one is really special, you will thank me later. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food, any burger can sub with chicken too. Truffle fries great an our waiter was very responsive. A bit of a wait so be prepared."}
{"text":"There are plenty of places to eat while in Vegas. Competition is fierce and relentless. The masses dictate the survival or death of an establishment with their thumbs, like back during the Roman days of the coliseum. One key to unlock the success of a restaurant is to appeal to the majority and even offer a selection that simply can change ones mind about a dish or entree. Gordon Ramsey's Burger has done that. I hate onion rings. I've never been attracted to the concept of wasting batter on an ingredient that's used as a topping or for just flavor. I absolutely love these onion rings! They are by far the showcase menu item to me because the level of excellence it presents overshadows the delicious and decadent selections of burgers that the famous F-you chef's menu offers. Cheers to you sir!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The service was amazing, & the food was delicious. We had a terrible experience at a different restaurant where we ended up leaving hungry. Came into this one and told them about our cruddy night. And they turned our night completely around with the service and the food. I'm vegetarian so it's hard to find a good veggie burger but this place has delicious vegetarian options! Cooked perfectly with flavors I never even thought to put together. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay Burger is located in Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. This restaurant originally opened as BurGR. The specialty of the restaurant are burgers. They serve a variety of burgers including a vegetarian. The beef is ground in the mothership kitchen at the Paris kitchen. They are serve appetizers, snacks, salad and milk shakes. This is a full service restaurant with a full bar.   This restaurant always seems busy with a long line to get in but it moves fast. The atmosphere is very fiery, loud and energetic. Our waiters were both very friendly and gave us a briefing on the menu and were able to answer any questions we had.  We started with the Truffle Fries. We received a very large portion of Truffle Fries with two dipping sauces, house made ketchup and truffle aioli. The fries and very creamy and soft but not soggy. The top fries taste the best with the cheese and salt but as you dig down the taste builds up too much and the salt collects and the fries also turn too salty. I'd get plain fries next time.   I tried the Tandoori Chicken Burger. The bun was buttered and grilled just like a grilled cheese sandwich. The chicken almost seemed chopped and was INCREDIBLY MOIST and juicy and full of flavor. It was an absolutely delicious burger full of flavors.  My husband had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. It's bigger than the chicken and is a 7 ounce patty. It was made Medium/Rare just like he asked for and was prepared just so and also was delicious.  The food and service really was good but on the pricy side for what it was. Two burgers, fries and some wine sets you back about $100.00."}
{"text":"Awesome service, up to par food quality. Will def come back when in town! We had the F word burger which is a new burger that hasnt even been added to the menu was the bomb!!! And also the hell wings best buffalo i have ever tried! Im not a fan of buffalo sauce so asked for it on the side jeez!!!! Was delicious!!! We split both plates with my husband and we were soooo full after! People may think is expensive but we are from San Francisco so these are in the cheapest/average prices for us but the portion size is at all comparing to SF here are huge!!! So at the end we save money... win win..."}
{"text":"So we came here to Mr. Ramsay's burger joint and the wait was an 1 and 30 minutes. Luckily our waiter was so awesome. He took very good care of us. Kept the drinks filled and the food came out really fast. 10 stars to Guy he totally rocked our socks. Now i didn't enjoy my burger all that much. But that's not taking away from Guy's 100% amazing customer service."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I visit Vegas and it never disappoints. The Hell's Kitchen burger is amazing along with the fries and shakes. The only criticism is that for parties of 3 or more they want you to visit the desk and they will text you. This is great except hardly anyone in line is aware of that, as its not clearly posted and the line is usually long. Another note about the line and that is it's usually hot in Vegas and they have you stand next to a firewall. This is an actual wall of fire, it looks neat but not so neat if you're hot. One you're seated it's great, friendly knowledgeable staff and the food is impeccable."}
{"text":"I normal don't write reviews but this i have to.Service was great 5 stars.the food had flavor BUT was not fresh and I'm sure Mr Ramsay would not be thrilled knowing his name is serving that food. I know I should've said something but when your out on that las vegas strip for a bit and hungry as heck who would you jus want to eat. Burger was barely warm and fries were stale if it wasn't for the chipotle ketchup I probably would've said something it did take a little bit to long also  so. my bill was about $65 for 2 people that's about the norm i guess in vegas but I've could've gone to in and out burger and it be cheaper and fresh."}
{"text":"The burgers were really good! I asked the Bartender if they had a rum punch he said no but he would make me one and he did and it was GOOOOD!"}
{"text":"Went to make a to go order and the blonde blue eyed ostess working Wednesday the 14th at 5:30 claimed the food takes thirty minutes to make and when I inquired why she said \"because that's how long it takes\" with her snappy attitude instead of explaining that to go orders take longer or being nice about it. Idk if you guys take pride in having girls work there with nasty attitudes or what be nice you're in the food service industry I'm a paying customer :)"}
{"text":"This being a Gordon Ramsay place, I held the food to a higher standard than I would ordinarily. I know of the guy, and I know he demands quality and precision. Would he have been in the kitchen that evening, I wouldn't have heard a barrage of profanity, but I would not exclude a bit of yelling.   First, the server I had, Alex I think was his name was awesome. He definitely knew his stuff, and not from a handbook or manual, no, this dude has tried literally everything. The fact that the food took a little longer than I would expect to come out he let me know ahead of time, which was much more appreciated than the \"It'll be right out\" when guests start to get antsy.   I had ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, cooked medium. Let's start with the good, so it doesn't seem like bashing this place is all I came to do: the flavor from the combination of ingredients was good! The burger wasn't overloaded to the point where you couldn't bite, but everything still came together nicely... or was supposed to.  Now, the not-so-good. If this were some little pub, I would give them more slack. In this case, I expected the same level of precision and quality Mr. Ramsay seems to demand of his chefs.   The meat in the burger was overcooked for what I ordered. Per the server, medium is supposed to have lots of pink. In my case, they had overcooked it, as I got a medium-well, with tiny hidden areas of pink in places. I also found the meat slightly underseasoned, a pinch more salt and pepper would have done this place quite a bit of good.   Then there was the overall execution which I found quite lacking. To me, when I bite into a burger, I'd like to get the same experience with the first bite, last bite, and each one in between. The avocado was more or less evenly dispersed, yet the roasted tomato(es) were very unevenly dispersed. Only a handful of bites got this taste, hence the quotes. As for the jalapeno aioli, it suffers the same problem... it was as if it was slapped on without regard. There was so little of this stuff, I don't even recall tasting it.  I'm hoping the photo I've attached from my meal will at least somewhat corroborate this point.   One of the final points I'd like to make is regarding the fries. If you are here with someone, the portions are great for splitting with a friend or two. However, if you come here alone as I did, the portion of fries it too big for one person. That said, it would be awesome if they had smaller, individual sized portions for those not wanting to eat for two."}
{"text":"Where do I start??? I'm not a typical burger and fries gal, but believe in giving things a fair chance. I do have to admit, I did have high expectations of a \"Gordon Ramsey\" restaurant.  Everything from service to quality was absolutely unenjoyable.   Small patties are hidden under an oversized bun. I expected a nice handmade patty, plump, and juicy, but the patties were undersized and all perfectly shaped and well-pressed under the flame. I ventured to order a \"special\" burger: lobster and shrimp... boy-o-boy was that a bad idea. The patty tasted like a rubber tire! I took a couple of bites just to make sure it wasn't me and tossed in the napkin. It ruined my appetite.  Quite some time after I'd tossed in the napkin, a manager stopped by to ask how our meal was. I commented on the poor quality and preparation of the lobster and shrimp burger. He did apologize and asked why I didn't let them know, as they could have made me another, but when I said I wouldn't want to try it again he said he'd let the kitchen know and simply moved on.   The sides were just as disappointing. The sweet potato fries were soggy, barely warm and covered in powdered sugar. They were served with a sweet opaque sauce they called a spicy aioli, but there was absolutely nothing spicy about it... it tasted like desert.   I'd put burgers, sandwiches and fries at this establishment in the same class as Red Robin, Johnny Rockets, Applebee's, etc.   If you want a good meal, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are delicious ketchup isn't traditional little weird for my liking but the food is great and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is worth the prize. Burger is delicious and the meat is juicy and tender and packed with flavor melts in your mouth delicious. Fries and onion rings are nice a crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Dipping sauces are flavorful too...worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent service, amazing food, came very quick, vintage Gordon Ramsay. If you ain't a big burger fan my mate had hot dogs he also really liked them. Best food we have had in Las Vegas by miles."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the servers are fantastic! The bartenders are so outstanding from being so friendly and super knowledgeable about \"Gordon Ramsay's\" menu. I give them all a 5 plus ******, Victor, Robert and Robert!!!! He is very lucky to have them on his team and as amazing employees.   Ok now the food! OMG, my husband and I can't get enough and have been here 5 x's in 3 days. If you have not tried it, it's a must come to place and try... you will be hooked.   Thanks to all the amazing people from the cooks, servers and bartenders that make this place happy and be a 5 star!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience at this restaurant. After short wait in a line outside, we were let into the restaurant. All food came out fresh and warm. We had the onion rings for an appetizer and they were great. I had a burger that was essentially a ground pork patty topped with shredded pork wrapped in bacon and it was good, I wish I would have gotten a regular burger. The Truffle fries were fantastic, as was the aioli that it came with. Next time I come I will try a different Burger, but if there is a line outside this place is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my bday and we had a show at 9pm to see. We were in line waiting from 7:40pm. We got seated at 8:45pmstill hoping we could eat something. We were informed that the burger will take 25minutes to cookimagine our disappointment. So we sat for a few seconds and stood up and left very hungry and disappointed. There were more seats when we were inside so I didn't understand why it took the 3 lady hostesses so long to seat waiting guests in line. I am a local but we rarely go to the strip because of the traffic and parking but this was a special night so we braved all that. We proceeded to JLo's concert which was incredibly awesome but we were very hungry.  Gordon Ramsay burger was such a tease"}
{"text":"Don't believe the bullshit from the Elites here it's not true, it can't be because I came here today and was not impressed.I was looking for something familiar and affordable and hey also because its Gordon's restaurant it's gotta be good right? . Although I was completely wrong about all my expectations. The wait was long about 1hr long wait for a table for four. The customer service was okay, it wasn't above average. My wife and I had already ate but the kids where hungry so we got them some grilled cheeses and we ordered the blue cheese burger with the truffle oil fries. And about three drinks at the end of the day we spent a whopping $70. The grilled cheeses were nothing impressive and the burger was so so, not what I would expect from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. The flavor combination was overpowering, too salty the bun was swamped with butter or an oil. The fries were ok they were not crispy but super chewy like bubble gum, it was like trying to bite off the cartilage of a chicken leg bone. Would I come back? Neh, for sure would go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Beautiful burger at beautiful venue! We could not enjoy our burger at the restaurant as there was an half hour wait at 6pm Monday night! Plus our children were restless then. So we bought two burgers and ate at hotel. Even then the burgers were destroyed by us in seconds while fighting over who will have the last bites! It's that good!   The buns were tasty and fluffy with sesame seeds.  The beef patty were real quality meat that was cooked perfectly to our order, medium well done, while succulent with a bit of red inside.  The matching of the sauces, herbs and condiments bring unique flavors to each burger but retains the original flavors of the star, the burger itself.  I don't know much about Godon Ramsay but having gone to both his fish and burger restaurants, this man really knows food!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and that's enough for me. Was good at all. Burger was way under cooked and fries average. And that the good part. We waited an hour for this meal. Much better and cheaper burgers on the strip."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful restaurant with delicious food and service.  The line was long but was still totally worth it.   I tried the hummus with veggies and the poutine.  Both were fantastic."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great burgers, great fries, great beer, and great service! Definitely a restaurant I will return to when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Even at 11pm there was a 1hr wait and let me say, absolutely worth it! Our party of 7 ordered all different kinds of burgers and they were all a hit. The Forest Burger is awesome with the duck bacon as is the mushroom poutine. The brown butter pecan shake is the perfect sweet note and is like a dessert dish on its own. Other favorites include the Hells Kitchen Burger and Farmhouse Burger. The burgers dont come with fries so you can order those on their own. One order of fries can easily be shared between 2-3 people. I do have to say that fries were a little dry and bland. Still, we loved this place! Oh, and they split our bill as we needed it without hassling us so thats a hug help when trying to figure out the bill after a night out in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped by and so glad that we did. I had the Farmhouse burger and was probably the best burger in my life. The burger itself was a perfect medium and the egg was so incredible on it. The chicken wings were also amazing and high quality. Would recommend this for any burger fans looking for something a little different but amazing in taste."}
{"text":"I've been really excited to try Gordon Ramsay burger after hearing great things about it (and watching his show!) unfortunately, it was a bit of a flop for me and disappointed.   After reviewing the menu, I decided to get the Hells Kitchen burger, which was supposed to have roasted jalape√±os, roasted tomatoes, jalape√±o aioli, asadero cheese, and avocado. Sounds spicy right? Not at all actually. I saw the roasted tomatoes and stuff in my burger, but it was not spicy at all. In fact, I couldn't really taste anything except for the avocado. Not even the jalape√±o aioli that was supposed to be in the burger. I ended up just dipping my burger in the ketchup and aioli sauces we got from the Parmesan fries because it was so dry. This was really disappointing.   The second thing that was really surprising was what happened with my friend's blue cheese burger. While this burger tasted much better than mine, the kitchen somehow messed up and there was PAPER in the burger! I could not believe that there was actual paper that somehow ended up in it. We complained about it to our server, Elijah, and he was very nice and quickly corrected it for us and replaced it with a new burger. Shoutout and thank you for correcting the situation. I was just really surprised that this type of thing happened at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.   I'll end the review on a good note with the Parmesan truffle fries - although I was hesitant about the $12 price tag, the fries were really good and you could taste the Parmesan and truffle sprinkled evenly throughout all of the fries. They come in a cone and sometimes because of that the seasoning may not be evenly spread out, but this was not the case at Gordon Ramsay, thankfully. I would have preferred the fries crispier, but they were still good.   Overall, the paper in burger thing was really the biggest surprise at this higher class establishment. That aside, the food was just okay to me and not mind blowing. The service was a saving grace and I appreciate everyone on the team who contributed to that!"}
{"text":"The burger place is excellent the burgers are fairly expensive but it's worth the price they try to do a very good job with the french fries really interesting twist on it I would try it out and don't let cost for a burger Scare you off"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The rings and fries, not so much. Definitely a little pricey. So, burger 5 stars, atmosphere 5 stars, server 5 stars, rings/fries 3 stars, value 4 stars. I live near Bobby's Burgers and we eat there often, this burger was definitely better, but I paid for it. Had the fries/rings matched the burger, I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!!! The thing that really amazed me was the pickles! I honestly hate pickles and i asked them to not put any in my burger, they put it on the side, i tried one pickle and it was the best thing ever!!! I highly recommend everyone to try, it has this mango sweet like twist to it!!!"}
{"text":"I've visited 3 times and every trip is phenomenal. I highly recommend the Hells Burger, not as big of a fan of the duck bacon & lettuce burger (too salty for me). The burgers are amazing and perhaps the cheapest way to experience a Gordon Ramsay inspired menu. The servers are excellent, if not perhaps a bit over-the-top.  I will say, though, that on my last trip (5/10/18), The bald bartender without a name tag was ridiculously unprofessional. He threw a fit in front of everyone that \"every shift needs to do stock\" then continued to gossip about other employees right in front of everyone sitting at the bar...I really disliked being stressed by his negative attitude & rants."}
{"text":"Burger was good but nothing really special. Took a while for the food to arrive. A bit too long for me. Ordered fries well done and they were not. I was not too happy with the service. Very slow. Also, i was sitting at a counter seat. I don't like employees standing right in front of me, checking their cell phones every time.   At the counter, they are close to you. Shouldn't you be working?  Overall, just ok. Will not go back."}
{"text":"This last trip to Las Vegas we were in search of the best burger on the strip. It was found in Gordon Ramsay's burger house in Planet Hollywood. Everybody's plates and that which we ordered were all spectacular. This is a must try you are into gourmet burgers.   All of the burger should attempt to come close to the quality and taste of Gordon Ramsey's burgers.   If you are looking for the same for the french fries don't hold any hope because the French fries were actually disgusting. If you want fantastic french fries go to Bobby's Burger Palace. The burgers are good there too but the french fries are fantastic!  Grab your burger at Gordon Ramsay's and head  over to Bobby's Burger Palace for the fries on you are in for a fantastic meal.     MANGA!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of really good restaurants but this by far has the best burger I have ever had. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and my  Girlfriend got the blu burger and they were both amazing."}
{"text":"Have eaten here before and was content waiting in line, however service was under par. Once sat, the first comments out of the waitresses mouth were \"prepare to wait another 40 minutes to get your burger\" We ordered drinks right away but it took 15 to 20 minutes to get those to us. The staff appeared to be unorganized. Our waitress was inattentive, not really checking in with us at all. After 40 minutes we recieved our burgers which were cooked perfectly and very delicious, however overall was not a good experience. Plates could use some updating as the Gordon Ramsey logo was very worn."}
{"text":"Staying at PH they gave us $ credit for RGB and everyday there is a line out the door.  So we must!  Our 4YO likes it!    What I ordered, traditional cheeseburger.  Used one of my faves for baseline, Hopdoddys.  It's bigger but probably not double the price better but it's convenient on the strip.  The burger is good but found the bun to be too commercial.  HD makes their in-house so always have a fresh-soft-buttery bun.    Overall a good burger and worth it with the credit!  PS dig the nachos!"}
{"text":"staff friendly attentive trained really well able to deal with customers that may or may bot be high and drunk i didn't remember what i ordered but when i got the fish and chips burger i was not disappointed they where surprised by the way i danced to jamacian music"}
{"text":"Our first stop in Vegas and we were starving.  There were maybe only 5 parties ahead of us so the wait wasn't too long.  Once we got seated, our server immediately grabbed our drinks and helped us out since it was our first times.  We started off with the kettle chip nachos.  They came out fairly quickly, maybe 2 minutes from ordering them.  It came with a good amount of short rib and corned beef but thought it was a little underseasoned.  For our burgers, my boyfriend ordered the farmhouse burger cause he really wanted an egg and I ordered the anniversary burger (aged rib eye patty topped with short rib).  Burgers were juicy but we both thought they were just ok.  Our server was very friendly but had to wait around since she was busy.  Burgers are reasonably priced, starting at around $15, but fries are not included in the order."}
{"text":"We were able to cut the queue and sat at the bar!  The brown butter and pecan shake was amazing!!!  I got sliders and shared poutine.  Both dishes were nice but I was pretty stuffed and couldn't eat it all!  We waited at least half an hour for our food after it was ordered but I guess it was pretty busy!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty but there's a long wait to be seated and the food comes out late as well. If you don't care for salty French fries ask the server to go easy on the salt. Great atmosphere and I reiterate good food"}
{"text":"Casual, sports bar feel.  Friendly service.  Yummy burgers and really great truffle fries!"}
{"text":"I come here every so often when I visit Vegas (maybe 2-3x a year?), and each time I've had a decently good meal with decently good service. Not really impressed with either, but I'm not necessarily disappointed. It's overly rated in my opinion simply because of the name on the restaurant."}
{"text":"For late-night dinner I tried the beer-battered onion rings ($9), burnt ends poutine ($14), truffle parmesan fries ($12), and the pork chop and applesauce burger ($16).  The onion rings seemed well-battered. The batter did not overwhelm with oil and possessed a fluffy texture.  The burnt ends poutine seemed at times over- and under-garnished. The burnt ends, in their limited quantity and size, made no apparent change in flavor profile. The shredded carrots' hard texture did not juxtapose well with the rest of the dish; future iterations should omit the carrots. The cheddar cheese curds also arrived in such limited quantities that they made no significant effect. The only redeemable element of the poutine, the black pepper gravy, had a lot of black pepper but needed a thicker consistency.  The truffle parmesan fries seemed satisfactory.  The pork chop applesauce burger contained a pork patty, dubliner cheese, branston pickles, apple braised pork shank, and cabbage-apple slaw. While these items individually sound delicious, their combination seemed underwhelming. The base pork patty seemed subdued in flavor, and the apple braising dominated the palate, relegating the other flavors to afterthoughts.  With the majority of my meal (burger + 1 appetizer) resulting in mediocrity, I will pass on future opportunities at this establishment."}
{"text":"This is  my favorite  Burger place in town. From its 30 foot long fire display and keg showcase., the atmosphere is as  exciting as the menu itself. We ordered ( the 3 of us cousins) the same . Lobster & Shrimp Burger, Hellfire Chicken wings & Their hand cut extra crispy Truffle Parmesan Fries with their signature curry ketchup . It's sinfully delicious!!! We top it with the ultimate sweet fix . White & milk chocolate Parfait.  Service is excellent! Celebrity Chef Gordon Ramsey delivers!"}
{"text":"The burger and fries were so extremely dry. So disappointing... I was expecting a deliciously juicy burger and amazing truffle fries. Unfortunately, the fries were dry as a bone!!! I mean horrible... the burger (crown burger) was so dry I had to slather mayo and ketchup on it. Just wrong!!! From Gordon local I expect much more. I understand they had a chef missing, but that's unacceptable. And yes, to not comp us anything or a free drink, is not right. Service was mediocre at the bar. Overall dissatisfied. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here at the last minute.  Got in quickly and was very impressed with the staff and organization.  We were greeted promptly and had a very nice server.  The manager was great too! Our food was excellent.  My husband said that it was the best burger he ever had.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a monthiversary with the bf & had such a good time!  THE WAIT: - there was a 20 foot line of people around 1PM on a Saturday but we only ended up waiting around 20 minutes!  THE FOOD: - Sweet potato fries +4/5 They sprinkle powdered sugar over the fries, giving the plate a unique, yummy taste. Feel free to ask for extra condiments (chipotle aioli, ketchup, etc..) on the side too!  - Hell's Kitchen Burger +4/5 This was my first time trying this burger & wow - it was good. I'm not a burger person so this says a lot too. The jalape√±o added the perfect spicy kick to it & trust me - add an egg to your burger to reward your tastebuds. The only downside was that the burger was pretty salty.  - Hogg Burger +4.5/5 The bf ordered this and we both didn't expect how big the burger was going to be. He couldn't finish all of it but devoured as much as he could. If you've already had the Hell's Kitchen burger, definitely try this one next!   SERVICE: - was amazing. Despite the restaurant was super busy, Daniel - our server - made sure that we got our drinks/food/check in a timely matter. Thanks, Daniel!  If you're visiting Vegas, definitely make an effort to come visit this spot - you won't be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"Long wait, rude hostess and very expensive mediocre burger....ordered the \"f burger\" after waiting an hour even though I saw tables available the whole time.  The burger I requested was supposed to be medium done and when it came out after 15 minutes it was well done and was dry plus I think ingredients missing....then the bill was sky high for this burger"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here with my mom and little sister for her birthday. We are all big Gordon Ramsay fans! Sad to say...we were all quite disappointed. The onion rings we had heard about were clearly pre-cooked and served to us super dry and tepid (probably from right under a heat lamp). My ahi tuna sliders were pretty good! But then my little sister, on her birthday, got sick from her cheeseburger :(  Very average, and definitely not up to Gordon's standards!"}
{"text":"After watching a concert at Planet Hollywood, I was starving! When we saw Gordon Ramsay Burger had no line, my friend and I decided to grab dinner here. We walked in on Wednesday, May 10th around 11:30pm. We were seated immediately at their counter with a view of the kitchen. A friend joined us later and we were able to grab an extra seat.  *Beer Battered Onion Rings: parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip ($9) *Hell's Kitchen Burger: asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes, jalapeno pesto aioli ($15) *Ultimate Cheeseburger: aged provelone, dublinar, boursin ($15) *\"Foie\" Burger: pate foie gras, chevre, port wine aioli, frisee ($21) *Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11) *Just Fries ($8) *Black Butte ($9) *Coors Light Draft ($8) √ó2 *Guinness Draft ($8)  I got the foie burger with truffle fries. I should have read the description closer as I thought it was going to come with seared foie. Instead, it was a foie pate. It probably would have been fine, but paired with the chevre, the burger was too rich. And not in a good way as the chevre added a tanginess I didn't like. It also seemed like the cheese and foie were fighting each other instead of complementing each other. I did enjoy the truffle fries, but I think it's hard to mess those up. We'd been drinking all day, so I just decided to get a couple Coors Light. It was easy to drink. The boys got the rest of the food and thought everything was okay. Not worth the price was the consensus.  I don't mind paying more for a good burger, but these are just okay."}
{"text":"I decided to bring my best friend to Gordon Ramsay Burger for her birthday! We always do the high end steak house type of thing but this time I wanted to switch things up. Gordon Ramsay is one of her favorite chefs and she loves burgers! So this place couldn't have been a better decision. I called in advance to try and make a reservation and was informed that they DO NOT accept reservations and it was a first come first serve type of situation. Yikes! Say what? Yeah I was bit nervous about this because being that we were going on a Saturday night I could only imagine how packed they were going to be!   When we first arrived the line looked like people ready to get on a roller coaster at six flags. I just knew the wait was going to be 2hrs! To my surprise I saw a sign that read \"For parties of 3 or more see host\" That worked out for us because we had exactly 3 in our party! Score! Gave the hostess my number at was told we would be seated in about 45 minutes! Not bad at ALL! The Miracle Mile Shops are good to wonder around when you have a wait like this but we didn't even have to wait the full 45 minutes I got a text message saying our table was ready in about 30 minutes. Wining points already!  Once we were seated our hostess came right over and gave us a cool little introduction about the place and explained the menu. I appreciated her acknowledging my best friends birthday and made sure that we were brought something out in celebration for that. The cocktail menu is on an iPad which I don't know why I always think this is so cool! No drinks for us though we had plenty before at Fat Tuesdays and at this point starving was an understatement!   Food:  Beer Battered Onion Rings- Parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip  Truffle Parmesan Fries  2 Farmhouse Burgers- Dublinar cheese, Mangalitsa bacon, fried egg  Backyard Burger- American cheese, butter lettuce, tomato,pickle, onion  Overall everything was fantastic! We really enjoyed ourselves and most important my best friend said that she was so excited to try this place. The service was top notch and the food came out exactly how we wanted. NO complaints just kudos and handclaps for Mr. Ramsay!"}
{"text":"Not the best burgers, but the best fries I've ever had with the best presentation of onion rings in a loop! I ordered the Swiss with mushroom and I think the grilled onion hamburger; it was too salty and soggy. To be honest, I just came because I thought it would be good in reference to Gordon Ramsay. I loved the restaurant setting and placement, it felt very chic and we'll put together but that's about it. I hope you have a better experience"}
{"text":"horrible. The food is EXTREMELY greasy and buttery, it tasted like I was eating pure butter. There was not much flavor in my burger at all. I eventually just stopped eating it. Secondly, the presentation was so plain. Just the burger on a plate with the logo of the restaurant faded and coming off. Lastly, there was a hair in our truffle mayonnaise. Not coming hear again and don't get why there's so much hype.   Looks like this restaurant needs to be on Kitchen Nightmares"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant that were quickly dashed by the slightly above average burger joint that is Gordon Ramsay Burger. We got into the restaurant very quickly and actually got to sit in front of the kitchen and see the food prepared. However, our order took 45 minutes to cook all the while several people came and got their food quicker than us even though they ordered later. I got the barnyard burger which was rather bland and mediocre in general. I also got the Parmesan fries; they were much like the restaurant: high hopes quickly dashed by an average product. In the end I would like to give them another chance but I am certainly going to give preference to other restaurants in the area first."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Foie\" Burger, which the waiter warned was a hit or miss due to the pate on the burger. I thought it was worth the price for the uniqueness of the ingredients. I also ordered truffle parmesan fries along with burned end poutine. Both were very delicious and enough to share with four people."}
{"text":"Husband went here last weekend on a business trip and hit the strip in search of a good burger. The burger was decent, not the best he's ever had but it was okay. He had set his expectations high being it was the \"Godon Ramsay Burger\" and it was meh...so so. Other thing that earned a 2 star rating was the payment error made by the server. My husband had to place the tip on his personal credit card because he can't tip with his business credit card. Though he asked the server 3 times, she still managed to put the entire bill $$$ on his personal card. Now I'm jumping through hoops with the bank to get the charge removed :("}
{"text":"This place is OKAY. Got the crown burger ($15) our waiter asked how I want the meat to be and I wanted it medium well done. Once the burger arrived and I took a bite into it, the meat was soooooo dry. It was so hard for me to swallow it down. Like wtf I can make better burgers that has juice coming out when biting into it. Disappointed. The waiter was meh.. only came to our table 2-4 ish time? Parmesan truffle fries were aight."}
{"text":"We came here because a friend of ours recommended it saying their burgers were amazing. That being said, we went on a Thursday morning, right before they were about to open, at 11am, and already there was a line of at least 15 ppl waiting to be seated. Definitely come right at opening time if you don't want to wait, this place fills up fast.   I ordered the forest burger, which had duck bacon and mushrooms which was pretty good. Portion size, I actually expected their burgers to be a little bigger than what was given to me...but overall it was a good sized burger. Definitely tender and juicy. However, what I really loved about this place were the truffle Parmesan fries! One order was enough for 4 ppl..and we definitely asked for a side of extra truffle sauce!"}
{"text":"nikki, johnny, callie, & eric are the best.   f word burger is here! delicious array of diverse tastes in burgers with great service & celebrity chef atmosphere.    most notable burgers include the hog burger as mentioned in vegas weekly, the f word from the new hit series by ramsay the f word, and the farmhouse burger with dubliner cheese, over easy egg, & mangalitsa bacon!   f word is sweet & savory with a bbq glazed beef short rib, fris√©e wrapped in a lemon citrus vinaigrette, & pickled sweet shallots. worth the time & price for aged ribeye & new york strip steak!  truffle fries are a good blend of buttery and rich flavors & cocktails/beer selection is expansive. the wait is definitely worth it for such a delicious experience at one of ramsay's best price points on the strip."}
{"text":"I ate here when it was still Burgr a few years ago and loved it. Had lunch here with a group of 7 on a Wednesday around 11am and there was no line. Had the Crown Burger, truffle fries, and Creme br√ªl√©e shake. The burger was somewhat dry and needing more seasoning, the truffle fries were too salty, aioli overpowered with mayo and didn't taste much of garlic/other flavors, and the shake was good despite being too sweet (it's a desert shake so I guess that's not too much of a shocker?). The service was great-the server checked in with us a few times and accommodated a request to switch out a burger because it was super dry (switched a Hog Burger to a Farmhouse instead). Restaurant was clean. (They recently switched from Burgr to Gordon Ramsay Burger)"}
{"text":"We went there  for lunch, we had to wait 15 minutes to seated. Nice sitting and environment. We ordered the truffle fries ( was good), lobster and shrimp burger ( was ok but too greasy) and the hells's kitchen burger ( I loved the bun and the burger too) but the I had better burgers, I was expecting more from Gordon Ramsay. It is quite expensive, average $16 for a burger sandwich. But overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a rare burger, thinking that I was at a ramsay restaurant it would be perfect. It took an hour and came out well done. I was very disappointed and my time was wasted."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay should do an episode of Kitchen Nightmares on his own restaurant. The burgers were below average, some of the \"snacks\" were gross. The only thing good about the restaurant was the service."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. The hostesses are incredibly rude while we are waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"There are lots of burgers on the strip so we had high expectations from Gordon's place.   He did not disappoint, the whole experience and the food was worth the extra bucks."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers off date. Irrespective of whether I know or not about Gordon Ramsay..we will definitely like the ambience, well managed staff. Would love to go back again. Bit on an expensive side, but worth it."}
{"text":"My friend and I really wanted to try this place and we were not disappointed. I got the \"Hells\" Kitchen burger while my friend got the Backyard burger. The burgers were soooo good omfg. We both got medium rare and it was nice and juicy. We also got the truffle Parmesan fries which comes with garlic aioli and something else. The garlic aioli gmfu in a good way though. Legit I would eat that garlic aioli with everything haha. The other sauce was just too sweet so we didn't like it very much. The servers are friendly, but we waited 30+ minutes for our food. People that came way after us got their food before us or at the same time so that's why I knocked off a star. Would def come back if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place out. There was a 30 minute wait so they gave us a beeper and we went to gamble. When it finally beeped we went to check in and were told the table will be ready shortly. Well...shortly meant 20 minutes! Once we were finally seated we ordered promptly just to wait another 40 minutes for our hamburgers. We were starving. The burgers were pretty good just not spectacular. Looking back I would have just found a nice hamburger joint off the beaten path. Would have been cheaper and just as good if not better and wouldn't have had to wait so long!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with friends. Service was good and it was definitely one of the better burgers I've had. The truffle fries are a must! Only gave 4 instead of 5 stars because my boyfriend's old fashioned was a little off."}
{"text":"Fans of good food and fast service will have a good time here if my lunch here was a good indication. We were greeted immediately with a smile when we walked in and were seated right away after walking in around 20 minutes after the restaurant opened.  A wall of flames greets guests as they enter the restaurant and the restaurant has a good mix of decor that might interest Gordon Ramsay fans in addition to sports bar appeal.  The onion rings are bomb!  Delicate shavings of cheese topped a large cone of crispy, beer-battered onion rings and the  ranch dressing made the each bite melt into my mouth. My brother and I agreed, these were the star of our lunch. My tandoori chicken burger was good, cooked perfectly with a fresh bun and my tangerine cocktail was so juicy, I wanted more, a great balance between sweetness and alcohol content. The tables have a subtle British theme from the glossy menus with Gordon Ramsay flanked by the British flag to the blue place settings with red cloth napkins, adding a nice touch to the table. One suggestion I'd have is to include plain fries with burgers to provide a more complete meal; it'd allow guests to still choose from their tasty-looking appetizer menu if they wish but would be a more traditional way to enjoy a burger without paying extra. We had a great experience, our waitress was friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  A fun lunch and an affordable option in Vegas!"}
{"text":"In town for Caps and Knights game, ate a late lunch beforehand. Had to wait for a table for 5 people but they texted us when our table was ready and it was worth the wait. Order the burgers as they come, do not add anything!!!! They are awesome just the way they are. You don't need any sauce or any thing extra. I had the backyard burger and my husband had the farmhouse burger. Awesome burgers, awesome fries, awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our group of friends from Seattle last night came for dinner. Everything was excellent. They sat our party of 7 within 10 minutes. The burgers and drinks were delicious. To top it off our server Adam was very friendly and punctual. We will definitely be back before we leave!"}
{"text":"Great food! !great place !!  I had hell's burger it was amazing with grilled jalape√±o and asadero cheese (I added bacon ) fries  and a root beer.. as appetizer had the wings they were so good... .Four stars instead of five because service could have been better . Server seemed to be distracted by the football game playing on tvs. After getting my food realized a lot of tables had the onion rings so  I order them but never got them... but  I was charged for them. Told server and she did fix The bill.  Great place !"}
{"text":"best burger! truffle fries...omg! so damn good. of course it's pricey and you're going to wait awhile..worth the wait...worth the money..you won't be disappointed:)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best burger I've tried!  Food & drinks are great our server was friendly and welcoming. Definitely coming back next time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night and the wait wasn't too long. Staff were friendly. Ordered the special hamburger that was not on the menu (limited to 100 per night). It was priced at $22. It was a strip sirloin and ribeye grounded together and topped with a little bit of brisket. This was a disappointment. The burger was dry, not tasty and I ordered it as suggested by the server. The bun was excellent.  The nachos tasted good but had way too much cream sauce. The onion rings were tasty. They come in this cone holder. The not so good part was the bottom rings got soggy with oil. Which made them unappetizing. Would I go eat there again? Probably not."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to rave enough about this burger.  The wait time here was minimal, we stood in line for ten minutes, tops, and spent that time gaping over the menu on the outside wall.  Once we were seated, we were waited upon in short order, by a friendly server named Guy.  I forgot the name of the burger I got, but it was the once with a fried egg on top (farm burger?  barnyard burger?) and it was exquisite.  I like my burger medium rare, and usually I struggle to get a place to cook it for me medium rare, but this one came out right at the perfect temperature.  It was juicy, and flavorful, and all the accoutrements included upon it were scrumptious, also.  The fried egg was perfectly fried (overcooked eggs are a huge no-no for me) and the yolk was velvety, and rich.  Just an all around excellent burger.  The fries were okay, the onion rings were okay.  For those you are provided with a few sauces, one it a curry flavored ketchup, which lo and behold tastes like curry.  There is also a chipotle ketchup, which was tasty, but I didn't get much chipotle out of it.  The third is a cheddar ranch which was mindblowingly out of this world.  I would have ordered more fried to get more of this cheddar ranch.  It tastes like ranch dressing, without the acidic finish, instead replaced with a creamy smooth cheese flavor.  I've never had a ranch quite like this, and I lament that I will probably never find a comparable copycat recipe.  Overall the burger was worth the price, really tasty, cutesy restaurant, good service...a good experience for the low to mid budget gordon ramsay fan."}
{"text":"Wait was ridiculous; over 2 hrs for Saturday lunch, but you can skip the line if you are total rewards platinum, diamond or seven star members.  Ordered Hog burger, Hells Kitchen burger, fries and chicken wings. Wings and fries are above average and burgers are so delicious. The burgers are very juicy. Hells kitchen burger is probably the best burger I have ever had in my life.  Price is insanely cheap. $15 for a burger in Vegas is like $5 elsewhere."}
{"text":"Boy I can't wait to come back! Gordon Ramsay you did not disappoint.  We went during the weekday so the wait was minimal.   I love how they had vegetarian options. You can replaced any of the burger with the portobella patty. Don't forget to order a shake with your burger. Let me tell you, it was probably the best shake I've ever had. I've been craving it ever since.   We ordered Hell's Kitchen Burger with the portobella mushroom patty, Truffle Burger, truffle fries, and Creme Br√ªl√©e Shake."}
{"text":"Our service was fast and we got our tables pretty quick. It was a party of five and we all ordered their burgers and side of two different types of fries. I wasn't really into the truffle fries but the regular ones were good. We all enjoyed our burgers and the server was really nice too!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey burgers are soooo amazing.  It's located in Planet Hollywood hotel and definitely worth stopping by if you are craving for gourmet burgers in Vegas.  There is always a line no matter what time of the day.  So expect a wait.   The wait time isn't too bad since there is a lot of things to do at the hotel while you are waiting.  Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, its always a good time to stop by for a quick bite anytime.  They serve gourmet burgers, fries, sandwiches, and shakes.   The ambience is modern and hip which you can either get dressed up or casual depending on the occasion.  The staff is friendly and always checks in to make sure you are enjoying your experience.    Food also was served fresh and fast.   We didn't have to wait long before our food arrived.   I highly recommend trying the turkey burger, sweet potato fries, and truffle parmesan fries.  I normally don't like sweet potato fries.  But it is so amazing  It was hot, fresh, and served with a homemade garlic aioli sauce.     Overall, it was a great experience.  I would highly come back again and try different food on the menu."}
{"text":"Best burger in town! Hell's Kitchen burger amazing! Friendly service, amazing food! Shakes were awesome! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We too the Hill's kitchen burger with sweet fries and Parmesan fries. I went starving and I thought that wouldn't be enough but it's actually bigger than the pictures.  There was a bit waiting line but worth waiting. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Good burger, awesome curry sauce for the fries!"}
{"text":"This is a go to spot every time I'm in Vegas! Every time we go there is a wait but they text you when your table is ready. Plenty of time to explore the casino while you wait. Every burger I've had here has been amazing and I love the jalape√±o popper appetizer! I've never had a shake here but want to try one when I come back in October! See you soon BurGR!"}
{"text":"The wait is long as usual but the systems were also down so it took an extra 30 minutes for the food to come out which was understandable. Burgers are always good as usual especially the poutine! The milkshakes are to die for so you have to get it or your meal will not be complete...seriously. Mind you the portions are pretty big so plan accordingly lol"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I make it a point to stop by GRB, ( 5th time) the Hells Kitchen Burger is my fav, and I've never had an issue here.. until..... Monday May 29, 2017 @10pm, Waited 40mins in line, (which was to be expected since it was Memorial Day wknd)... was seated and had to wait another 15 mins to be acknowledge by anyone, or served water, finally was able to place our orders and then proceeded to wait another 38 mins for our food to come out. Burgers were suppose to be Medium rare, and they both came out over done and super dry, we had ordered fries that literally tasted like the bottom scrapped ends of sand paper, I'm giving this review 2 stars because at least the crem√© br√ªl√©e shake was amazing. Very disappointing GRB was always one of my go to restaurants in LV. Not anymore."}
{"text":"After a long drive, it was nice to find a place to sit down and eat. The line for this place however is ridiculous. It was near closing time and the line went beyond the their fiery design. Luckily we had a card carrying member and we got to skip ahead. The place is good but I think that the popularity is carried by his name. A man who made his name by being mean. The burgers were good but it was the truffle fries that won me over. Stop by if the line is short other wise go on ahead and skip it."}
{"text":"Damn tasty. Excellent burgers and bar food, very friendly staff, upbeat and sporty ambience. Went back twice in one weekend!"}
{"text":"Best Nachos ever.  Also our grou had the blue cheese burger and the ahai sliders amazing.   Lobster seafood not so much other then that fabulous to pout. Craving the Nachos."}
{"text":"So lets start with the venue. The restaurant has a clean look and feel that tilts towards a group setting or even a casual date. Service is great, the decor is eye catching, and the music is not in your face.   Now onto the food:  Truffle fries: Straight fire. But ask for extra ketchup.   Sweet potato fries: Yes I know the name says sweet, but I guess personally most of the time I have sweet potato fries they're not really on the sweet side. These ones also had a layer of sugar on top which really gave it that side, so personally I wasn't a fan and would've just struck to the truffle.   Forest Burger: I am a big mushroom person which is why I was leaning towards this one, and I will say that the mushrooms had a TON of flavor. The burger overall was pretty tight. I will say that there was a unanimous decisions that all of the burgers we had were slacking on saucing. So it really tasted like a patty and then your veggies on top. Similarly, i'd recommend asking for an extra sauce.  Finally the milkshakes were very very underwhelming. They only had three flavors and they weren't thick at all. I like true diner style milkshakes and this wasn't that. Of the three flavors I would recommend the butterscotch, even though I typically go for oreo flavored."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium burger. I confirmed with the server that medium will be medium cause some places with error on the more cooked side. Burger came...it was well...the server took it back an assured me that they will fix it...burger came back rare. There was blood on my bun."}
{"text":"I came here expecting to hear Ramsay dropping 'F bombs' but I settled for the 'F burger' instead. What is the Gordon Ramsay Burger restaurant? It's literally the physical brick and mortar restaurant embodiment of the man himself.  In true Gordon Ramsay fashion, his restaurant takes on the famous chef's personality, with flames engulfing his patrons as they dine. His menu offers a selection of delicious burgers, fries, and beverages in a sit down and flame infused environment. Make sure to come early, and put down your name - the wait time can be excruciating!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I shared truffle fries with my boyfriend and got the forest burger because sometimes people say I am a woodland creature, whatever that means. I was not a fan of the trumpet mushrooms on top but other than that, this was pretty good. The truffle fries were quite salty and definitely well-made. Gordon Ramsay did not disappoint, but I don't think I will come back. I loved the decoration inside and the mini waving fingers of fire in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. We got there at about 3:30pm and there was a queue. We waited about 15 minutes before we were seated ( we were a party of 2). So the wait wasn't bad at all.   Our waitress was really lovely! We ordered quickly because we decided what we wanted while waiting in the queue. I had the blue cheese burger , hubby had the Gordon Ramsey ( Hell's Kitchen) Burger and we shared fried ( the fries are huge and enough for 2 -3 people). The food took really long to come out of the kitchen ( like 30 maybe 35 minutes). The wait was worth it because the burger and fries was delicious! Probably the best burger I have ever had. I'll definitely be going back to try a few other burgers while I'm in Las Vegas.   For vegetarians - they have a portobello mushroom burger which sounded amazing! I might have that one when I go back.   Tip- it's quite warm sitting by the glass window as there's a display fire ."}
{"text":"I had high expectations and GRB did not deliver. I've had a better burger at Denny's. Leave it to this Brits, who eat fries with mayo, to mess up a simple thing like ketchup. The ketchups here pretty much suck. My advice... bring your own ketchup."}
{"text":"Pros: variety of tasty burgers and sweet potatoes are a must!!  Cons: Long wait, longtime for burgers to come out"}
{"text":"When it comes to gordon ramsay's place, it has to be good! The burger and the fries were awesome! Service was okay, but the ambiance of the place was great."}
{"text":"Not all it's cracked up to be. I ordered the blue cheeseburger based on the recommendation of the waiter and was not overly impressed. The meat had no real flavor of its own and you could hardly taste the blue cheese. I can see now why the waiter was pushing hard for fried onions and bacon on everyone's burgers since by themselves they tasted  like they were missing something. My friend ordered an egg on his \"Anniversary Burger\" and it came with a half inch piece of shell in it. The waiter apologized but then only reimbursed the charge for adding the egg. Poor customer service move.   One positive was the delicious Poutine we ordered for an appetizer. That was done extremely well. Overall, this place is not worth the wait or the money."}
{"text":"We're both huge fans of Ramsay, and we try to go to all his restaurants, burger was one of the few that we were so/so about.  It's great food but giving the name behind it and the cost (cost increase do you being on the strip) it's a tourist restaurant for sure. For those who live here in Vegas there are local places with just as good burgers for a cheaper cost.   I would still recommend going for the experience after all you are here on vacation"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. We waited for 40 minutes in line, then waited another 40 minutes for food!The $11 fries were not fresh, dry as if left under a heating lamp. The burgers were cooked unevenly. Three people ordered the same burger medium...one was dry, one was raw, and one was actually medium. Gorden Ramsey where are you?  I'd be ashamed to have my name attached to this place."}
{"text":"Good but beware, the lines can get ridiculously long. That's why you gotta get your Seven Stars or Platinum buddy to come to the rescue. It just cuts everyone in line like a hot knife over butter.  -- Got to try 4 burgers and 3 fries --  Let's start with the BEST, the burgers:  1) Forest Burger $17 - AMAZING. Wow, the juicy tender incredibly flavorful patty with even more flavor from the tremor cheese, forest mushrooms, arugula (dressed, no naked ingredients here!) and duck bacon. I just wished my stomach could handle more but the sides we got were killers [I would not order 3 sides of fries for 4 people]  2) Farmhouse Burger $17 - This was great. All protein and not a sight of plant here. I think the fat afrom the mangalitsa bacon does the trick here, a shiny burger doused in liquid lard.   3) \"Foie\" Burger $22 - My friend got this and she didn't love it. I thought it was okay as I am not a fan of foie anymore. I think it was just too heavy in all aspect, fat, foie, cheese... I personally think burgers should have some vegetables to balance the heaviness. The last two did not.   4) There was also a Lobster and shrimp burger but it isn't on the menu anymore. It was good and lightish but here, you gotta get the beef.   Then there were the sides which really felt like the main courses too (not my favorite and next time, I would skip these altogether)  1) Beer Battered Onion Rings $9. Good but honestly, too much in terms of dough and the salty parmigiano-reggiano as they were very generous with it. The additives make these heavier than your usual rings. Plan accordingly because we did NOT finish any of the fries and we are not slim people.  2) Truffle Parmesan Fries $12. There were aromatic as expected. Thick cut, loads of potato action here. Possibly a tad dry and a little too hard for my liking.   3) Sweet potato fries. Disappointing because they were limp and not hot. They were clearly not freshly fried. I think they were SO busy that night that the quality of the food kinda dropped.   We asked them to bring us freshly fried ones but the next batch was simply hotter and a little darker but did not feel fresh. We left them. Service was slow, it was a busy night."}
{"text":"I'm glad I stopped in but wouldn't go out of my way to do it again. Shared the forest burger and an order of truffle fries. Waiter asked if we wanted the fries as an appetizer. Seems like waiters might recommend that because it takes so damn long to get your food. I think we waited just shy of an hour for a gourmet burger and fries that were both mediocre in relation to price and wait time. The forest burger was nearly devoid of mushrooms (only two little morsels on each half) and the fries were kinda dried out steak fries and came with two sauces. The one sauce was a truffle aioli which was good and the other was a \"ketchup\" that I am pretty sure was house made and not very good. I could taste the worshi sauce and celery salt and other ingredients independently and it wasn't very well balanced. Heard management dealing with other customers regarding wait time and seemed very service oriented. Perhaps the wait time was a bit more than usual. I would recommend giving this place a try maybe during off hours in between lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not too much on chef named restaurants because everyone I've ever tried including his were not very good but I must say the hamburgers pretty damn good I will return the service from the bartender where I sat was excellent I wish I could remember his name"}
{"text":"The line was scary long. Luckily they let Total Rewards Platinum and higher levels cut the line. I know it's not fair but I'm not complaining. I would say it's not worth the wait but if there is no wait then it's a pretty good burger spot.  The hell fire wings were not spicy. It had a sweetness that I rather it didn't have. It also didn't come with any dipping sauce. I had to ask and was told they don't have blue cheese. They did have ranch but it's just not the same. I was happy to see that the wings were partially deboned.  I got the farmhouse burger. It comes with bacon and an egg. It was really good but the burger came dry, no sauces. I had to ask for mayo. It also doesn't come with fries so I ordered the truffle fries. I don't like the fact it was the thick steak fries. I wish it was cut thinner however the truffle aioli that it came with was ridiculously good.  They also had a lot of unique burgers but I was not feeling adventurous that day. Great burger spot if you don't have to wait. Otherwise it's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great burger food and service! They got the order wrong but it didn't matter the food was great and the waitress was amazing."}
{"text":"Great flavored Blue Cheese Burger. Cooked perfectly medium. Fries are good, find fry sauce  okay. It's fresh, but just not my favorite. Would give higher but the list more order. Manager was proactive and comp'd the meal."}
{"text":"Oh my god yum! Best burger I have had. Totally worth dealing with the trash on the strip!"}
{"text":"Its everything you would expect from a Ramsay restaurant.  The food was incredible, the service impeccable, the place was spotless, and it was truly enjoyed"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing. The wait was about an hour, but we got to put our names on the list and walk around the mall until we get a text. We ordered as soon as we sat down, since we heard it takes about 25 minutes for the burger to be made. I got the Mediterranean Burger and Truffles Parmesan Fries. Both were so flavorful and delicious, totally worth the wait. The services was great. There's absolutely nothing to complain about. I highly recommend coming here if you're going to Vegas for a mini-vacation, I promise you will not regret it."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!! I got them nachos! Wow the cream cheese was delicious! And got the Poutine! The meat on the pountie was was sooooooo good! And the sauce with it was absolutely and eye opener. The burger I had was the Hog Burger. It was so juicy that when I took my first bite, the meat juice dropped on to my pants! It was worth it! The text message was a plus!"}
{"text":"Hog burger are crazy good. I'm not a fan of bluecheese so bluecheese burger (in my opinion) is not that crazy yummy. Every piece in the burger makes it worth with the price. Pork meat in hog burger is thick. Pickles are homemade fresh and unique taste. I don't like pickles in general but pickles in hog burger are bomb. Veggie in bluecheese burger is fresh. 2 appetizers (fries with curry souce and mushroom poutine something) are ok but not crazy good.   Service is decent. Waiting line is not bad (I got the table right away when I got there. I came there around 7ish Sunday night). Location is easy to find and decoration in there looks nice.  Worth to try at least one time in your life!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas on Vacation. We decided to check out Chef Ramsay's burger, since we are big fans of the show.   Restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood.  As we arrived, there was a long line. The host was going down the line taking names. For a party of 3 or more you do not have to wait in line. They write down your cell phone number and call you as soon as a table is ready.  Wait was 1hr. 40min.  Finally we sat down!!!  Restaurant looks very clean and Nice decor.  Ordered 3 Hells Burgers and 1 hot dog.   Took about another 30-45 min. For our food to come out! A total of almost 4 hours from the time we checked in to the time we left. Wow!!!   My Party and I where really Disappointed!   $15 Burger does not come with a side.  We ordered a side of wedges and onion rings.   \"Hells Burger\" the description seemed like if it would be a spicy burger includes jalape√±os and avocado. Nope!!! The presentation was really nice, but my burger was tasteless, it needed something, no sauce, I did not taste like jalape√±o, it just needed something. It just seemed like a burger I could have prepared myself at home.   Fries and onion rings, nothing special.    Hot dog is huge, but nothing special.   They don't offer a children's menu.   I was just expecting way more. I have had a way better burger somewhere else for cheaper, with a side, and without the almost 2 hour wait.   I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"To die for! I love their burgers and their sauces. This time around we tried their Creme br√ªl√©e shake. Oh yeah you better get it! It's delicious! The wait time is very long so don't wait in line hungry because you'll just starve but if your stomach can wait then go for it. This is our go to spot when we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers. Time to try the lobster and shrimp sandwich and creme br√ªl√©e shake."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. I absolutely love their Oreo Creme Br√ªl√©e shake... it's ridiculously good. The line can get a little long, but they are great at moving people through pretty quick. The decor is pretty cool, especially the fire decorative accent near the entrance."}
{"text":"First off, we were told it would be roughly a 20-30 minute wait... literally over an hour wait, although they took multiple large parties who got there after us.   Second, the food took quite awhile. The truffle fries came out quick, but the burgers took about 30 minutes.   Third, the burgers were not great. The beef patty is pretty small. And it was kind of dry and didn't taste very good. I got the blue burger and my friend had the farmhouse.   Absolutely not worth the wait or the money."}
{"text":"Ordered the Turducken burger.  Took my first bite and choked on a large bone.   Showed the waitress, who showed the head chef.   Guess they didn't give a shit.   Otherwise, good stuff."}
{"text":"Tourist trap!!  Waiter warned us it takes 35 minutes for the burger.  40 minutes later we got our food and no one in our party of 4 ordered a burger.  Food is just ok."}
{"text":"The burgers are honestly amazing I've had almost every burger! And there all good. My favorite is the farmer burger. There homemade ketchup is to die for. The price is really good and the staff is really sweet and nice i recommend this place to all friends that come into town."}
{"text":"Went here when I got my wisdom teeth pulled out and it was a great experience! Really enjoyed the cheeseburger I got from here and the Oreo milkshake, really made my day better! Service for superb and the food was awesome. Wish I didn't live so far, I'd come all the time!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Gordon Ramsay for as long as I've been a foodie. We picked this place over the other GR restaurant because it was within our price range. It's located in Planet Hollywood and you're greeted by a line of fire with the words Gordon Ramsay Burger. The wait wasn't bad, the line moved pretty quickly but please note that if you have a party of more than 3 people, go to the front and tell the wait staff. We had a party of about 15 and we didn't see that sign until we were near the front so it was too late for that. Our wait was about an hour on a Monday night. I think if you have a smaller party, the wait should not be as long as ours. And reservations aren't available. The neat thing is you don't have to be there waiting until the hour is up, I was able to give them my number and they would text me when the table is clearing. We walked around outside and saw the Fountains at the Bellagio.  I ordered the Hell Kitchen's burger with the truffle fries. They warn you ahead of time to share the truffle fries with a couple of people so don't let the price deter you. This was probably the best burger I have ever had in my life. It definitely beats a few of my favorite burger joints in Dallas. It's also big so you'll be super satisfied. I split my burger with my friend who had the Farmhouse burger. The Farmhouse burger was interesting, wasn't my favorite exactly but it was still good. It had interesting toppings. The truffle fries were super flavorful. Every bite you took had good flavor. We were able to dip it in an aioli sauce and ketchup. The ketchup here is SUPER fresh, not packaged in a Hunt's ketchup bottle and you can definitely tell. I'm telling everyone who goes to Vegas to check this place out. Definitely worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Review for truffle fries, forest burger and oreo cookie cream brulee shake   * Fries: tasted amazing! The yellow dipping sauve makes it 10 tines better. 10/10 recommend. * Burger: patty tastes super juicy, yumm. I don't like the cheese at all, maybe it's not my taste. I could only finish half of the burger. * Shake: if you can't comprehend a cup full of sugar then don't. 60% of the shake is the thick, overly sweet cream brulee cream, the rest is oreo shake.   I still give it 5 stars because I really like how the food is cooked. I will come back to try other burgers, and more truffle fries!"}
{"text":"I personally love this place, aioli ketchup, curry ketchup---truffle oil Parmesan fries---priceless.  Especially get those out first because burgers take some time.  Really great beers on tap.  I love the farmhouse-juicy beef with bacon and egg.  Love it.  Buns are great.  Don't pass up this place, in the Planet Hollywood.  Highly recommend.  The only downs are always a wait(good sign), and burgers take a minute to come out.  Make sure you order the fries------"}
{"text":"The experience was great.  Food was delicious.  The company outstanding.   The curry dipping sauce was out of the world.    The Carmel Pecan Shake was delicious,  more shake less whipped cream next time.   See you soon Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very slow service even when not busy  They have a very large staff but slow in cooking the food. It's only burger and fries. We ordered dessert. A tart. It took 20 min for something that requires no cooking."}
{"text":"After a 40min wait for my burger it was just \"ok\". In n out or Eureka is way better, pretty disappointed, I wanted to like it! :("}
{"text":"Best mushroom burger. Every bite was full of flavor. The cap was grilled to perfection, no watery residue !"}
{"text":"Very good and different food paired with just the right combo of salty sweet and flavor packed dishes!  Only thing bad is the wait which is normally pretty long unless your a diamond or platinum then it's great but don't forget your iD"}
{"text":"Wait was 30 minutes on a Friday night (not bad at all). The burgers were delicious (we got the Farmhouse and the Swine) but the highlight was the Parmesan Truffle Fries, they were thick cut, well-seasoned and not too truffle-y."}
{"text":"My first time here was back in February and there have been some changes since I last came. My recent visit was around 10/16/17 and it was still amazing. Just letting you know now that there will be a line and you will have to wait. My Boyfriend and I were a little disappointed with the Menu changes and it looks like Ramsay did a lot of consolidating on his BURGR menu. The favorites were still on there but the appetizer section was lacking and we didn't order any because of that. BUT YOU DON'T NEED IT- trust me. We both got Burger's (can't remember which ones) and a side of Truffle Fries. It's delicious, and when we advise them we want it cooked Medium Rare you best believe it comes out exactly at that temperature!! This place is amazing and you have to try it at least once if you're skeptical!"}
{"text":"It was good. I liked the bun and burger itself but all the toppings were kind of bland. The fries were probably my favorite part of the meal. And for being Vegas, I didn't remember thinking it was crazy expensive.   And that's all I have to say about that.   Jackee"}
{"text":"We were seated right away so that was nice. Love the location of it so you don't get lost in the Casino looking for it! My mom and I split the Crown burger, and it was pretty good but not life changing. My Dad however had the Farmhouse burger and said it was the best burger he'd ever had. He's an old man from the South who's had a lot of burgers in his time, so that's saying something. The Truffle Fries were AMAZING. Just wow. It may be an extra add into the price but they are more then worth it. Just get them."}
{"text":"Just an FYI: this restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood. Now for my review:  My husband loooves Gordon Ramsay. Lately he's been watching reruns of Kitchen Nightmares, and I've been trying to avoid hearing it in the background (yuck!). When we were staying in Vegas, I knew we had to go to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. If you're dining at Burger, there'll likely be a line. We waited for about 20-30 minutes, and were offered a seat at the bar and we took it. The line seemed to die down around 10 pm (on a Sunday night).   Yes, this is a splurge. You're paying for the experience of eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant. That said, my burger was outstanding. I had the U.K. burger and it was honestly one of the best burgers I've had, if not the best. It had fresh green arugula and chutney on it. I'm not sure if they grow their arugula, but as someone who's currently growing lettuce, it usually only looks and tastes as fresh as it did if it was harvested recently. The other standout of the night was the white sangria. It was amazing. It has apple, pear, and cinnamon - just fantastic!  I'm only knocking off a star, because of a few things:  - I wasn't a fan of my husband's Hell's Kitchen burger. The flavor was just odd to me. - The online menu needs to be updated. - I wasn't a fan of the sweet potato fries. Maybe I wished they were more savory. They were kind of sweet, but not like dessert. It seemed like they were having an identity crisis.  Otherwise, if we're in Vegas again I might have to come back for the U.K. burger!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 2 and went for snacks around 4pm. This place is located in Planet Hollywood and since we were staying in the same hotel, it was a no brainer for us. There was hardly any line when we arrived. But after leaving the restaurant I noticed there was a long line of hungry people wanting to eat.  I had always wanted to try a Gordon Ramsay place, and this place is true to his name.   We ordered Portobello burger and Truffle parmesan fries. Each of the fries had the perfect seasoning and right quantity of cheese. It had a perfect crust and was so flavorful. Each of the fries felt just melted in my mouth. Wanted to curl up can use them as my blanket and sleep Loved the burger too.. they perfect just perfection..  Place is definitely worth your money and time."}
{"text":"I had a farm burger with truffle fries. It was great for the price (very affordable burgers). Not incredibly memorable, but would come back over other local burger joints.  The atmosphere felt like a modern retro diner. I really liked the simplicity of the place despite it carrying the Gordon Ramsay name."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing, and they are incredibly reasonably priced. My bloody mary was weak, which was a bummer, but the food was mega satisfying to me and my friend so that outweighs the drink experience.  I will definitely hit up this place again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I liked  my Lamb Burger.My dad ordwred fish and chips  and they were very ordinary. Nothing  special.I guess I was expecting  outstanding,when  it  comes  to Gordon Ramsey"}
{"text":"Never say you've had the best burger till you've tried the burgers at gordon ramsay burger. Honestly, there's no joking around here ^^  I tried their Crown burger and it was life changing. Gotta say it kinda sucks cuz they raised the bar so damn high! Definitely get the truffle parmesan fries. It's amazing plus it comes with in house made ketchup and truffle aioli dipping sauces. And their jalape√±o poppers were fire. Is it weird I only look forward to eating here when I think about vegas ^^"}
{"text":"What can I say? The burgers were something else! We tried the anniversary burger and OMG so delicious. The ambience is casual and the price is a bit high for a burger but the burgers are not a regular burgers so it was worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch before heading home from LV. I thought the burger was really good; I had the Ultimate Cheeseburger (3 cheeses, provolone, boursin and cheddar). Mine was med well and it was cooked perfectly.  The bun (the unsung component of the burger experience) was really good and fresh.  The fries were meh - nothing special and it did not measure up to the burgers.  The fries were steak fries, which I'm not a fan of.  It comes with 2 house ketchups; ask for Heinz and they'll bring it to you. They have sweet potato fries, which comes with a shaker of powdered sugar and an aioli.  I'd go back when I'm in the area; it was good and not outrageously priced."}
{"text":"Steak was burned on outside and raw on inside, $68.00 bone in ribeye, told the server I wanted it medium rare, not rare. Complete failure and disappointment. Wanted a tasty crust, not a burned crust sear. Step your game up Gordon, you let use down."}
{"text":"We had a large party of 9 people and we were excited to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. We left our name with the hostess and were seated after an hour. Service was decent and friendly, but we did have to ask for water and condiments twice. We ordered a variety of burgers plus some side orders of fries (burgers are a la carte) and we all agreed that they were good, but nothing amazing. It wasn't worth the $24+ price tag. I ordered the Forest Burger which promised duck bacon and seasonal mushrooms and a side of Just Fries.The bun was nice and soft. The meat was cooked perfectly to order, but the it could have had more fat. The \"seasonal\" mushrooms were just criminis and shimejis which can be bought at many grocery stores. I was expecting something more exotic. The duck \"bacon\" was just a crispy piece of duck meat with barely any skin or fat. When you think bacon, you think a nice mix of meat and fat. The burger also had unmentioned goat cheese. I am not a big fan of goat cheese, but it worked with the burger because of the aforementioned lack of fat content.  The \"fries\" are thick cut British chips, not bad, but a little misleading. I can get a better quality and better priced burger back home in the San Francisco Bay Area."}
{"text":"So let's see two years ago when we stayed at Planet Hollywood we ate here eight times.  And now we're back!  I love this place. I've gotten a lot of items on the menu but my favorite dishes would have to be the Hell's Kitchen burger and wings.  The burger is cooked perfectly to your specifications and doesn't come soggy like most places. The bun is crisp and goes really well.   I asked for the wings to be cooked extra crispy and naked and they came out perfectly. I recommend doing it this way so the wings aren't soggy because if the sauce is on the wings too long it'll happen.  In conclusion if your staying at Planet Hollywood do yourself a favor and come here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few years ago but it looks like that Yelp page has been closed so I guess a new review is in order.  While they don't take reservations, if you get there early enough, the line is maybe a 10-15 minute wait. This is absolutely one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. I don't think you can go wrong with any burger at this place but I've got to recognize the Ultimate Cheeseburger, which is my go to item. The buns are quality, the burger is juicy and flavorful, and it has three kinds of cheeses mixed together in what can only be described as my version of heaven. My husband had the Lobster/Shrimp burger which has a shrimp/lobster type patty and pickled veggies on it. It's really a different option then the traditional burgers.   Lastly, you need to get one of their milkshakes. We didn't last time we were there so we made a point to try the Oreo Creme Brulee Shake on this trip. It is so rich and the flavor is better then just your average oreo shake because of the creme brulee pudding on the top. The cocktails we had were also on point. I don't remember what they were called but the white sangria I ordered was our favorite because it had this really nice cinnamon after taste. Do not miss this restaurant!"}
{"text":"60 mins for a burger on a Friday at 1:30pm - this is ridiculous- its a  burger  not a entree- all we have gotten was food will be out shortly and two refills.  We had to call the manger \"zack\" which was very helpful but what happen was our server never put in the order - wow - food will be on the house but just wasted 1.5 hours of our time in Vegas- finally got our food and wifey burger came out over cooked wow def hells kitchen"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I try to go to Food Network star restaurants when I can to see if they are as good as I would hope.  This did not disappoint.  I ordered the Blue Cheeseburger and Truffle Fries.  Amazing burger (albeit pricey).  If you are debating this venue vs Bobby Flay Burger Palace definitely go to Gordon Ramsay Burger."}
{"text":"Not a burger person but had to stop in for a try. Service was amazing. Good was well priced. And the burger was one of the best I had"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  This place was soooooo good!!!  I'm not a huge fan of burgers, but I am a fan of Gordon Ramsay so I was willing to try with hubby.  We had the Hells Kitchen burger & Fries with Curry Sauce.  Absolutely delicious.  We would go back!  I did see children in this restaurant, but I'm still saying it's not good for children because I'm not a fan of children in Vegas.  Too much for them to be exposed to at such a young age."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Gordon Ramsay. He is an amazing chef and I applaud all his hard work. The first time I came to this restaurant was a couple years back when they had on their menu this amazing delicate fancy fish sandwich. I came back here early june to find out they took it off their menu which was a bummer to hear but Instead I tried one of his other options I got the tandoori chicken burger I believe. It was VERY moist and had amazing flavor to it ! I highly recommend it, My husband got the hells kitchen burger and he was it was pretty damn good. and My in-laws also got great burgers but unfortunately I cannot remember them at the moment. I suggested we get the onion rings because the batter (from what I last remembered) was out of this world! His recipes are to die for and his kitchen runs so smoothly. I love how immaculate everything was. We would LOVE to come back next time."}
{"text":"I finally went to GR Burger, and hands down my new favorite place to go to in Vegas! Everything from the food to the service was phenomenal! If I could give it more than five stars I would! The hosts were very cheerful and accommodating. Once we sat down, Justin greeted us and gave us the complete run down of the menu. You can tell he is very passionate about what he does and has a lot of knowledge of everything on the menu. He made everything so personal and reccomended a few things for us to try. I am a total sucker for Buzzfeed Worth It episodes so I HAD to go with The Hog Burger. We also got the Truffle Fries. Everything was absolutely delicious and I cannot wait to go back again and try a new burger. A huge thanks to Justin for making our visit great!"}
{"text":"We've heard nothing but good things about this spot. We've always wanted to stop in and get a bite but the line is always long. We finally waited in the line and it was worth it. The burgers are really good. The onion rings are the bomb. We started with the ahi sliders and they were awesome. It's definitely worth it to wait in the line."}
{"text":"Maannnnnnnnn I LOVE EATING HERE!!!! I used to be a dealer at Planet Hollywood so I remember when this place was first constructed. My friend at the time who was food and beverage manager for casino ended up taking over the manager position here. He kept telling me to come and that it was really good. I finally take him up on his offer and bring my friend along. When I tell you that everything we had was delicious......I mean EVERTHING! He decided to pick out all the courses for us from appetizer to the dessert. I can't remember what I had that time because it was many years back, but I do know that it was the most delicious burger I've ever had. I mean the meat was cooked to perfection and just melted in your mouth with every bite! I'm hungry thinking about it now. Been back a few times since then and the only thing that has changed is the five course meal! Everything else is exceptional and service is 5 star. You want a burger, you will not want any others after going here!"}
{"text":"Very slow service, It took an hour to get my food and the other person at the table didn't, 10 minutes later I had to ask our server if the rest of the tables food was coming. He had to retake the order and then I had to return my food as it now was cold. They seemed not to know serving one person at a time was not normal. When we got our food 1.5 hours after sitting down. The burgers were good.  Service sucked The person came by that I assume was a manager but as she didn't speak up we couldn't hear a word she said! Don't even know if she was a manager.  They didn't seem to care!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for the weekend of 6/30 to 7/2, we stayed at Planet Hollywood and this restaurant is conveniently located in the hotel. When you check in you give them your phone number and they text you when your table is ready. Which is a really nice feature because you can walk around the casino or even go back up to your room if you are staying there.  The food was delicious! I had the ultimate cheeseburger since I am a big fan of cheese, it did not disappoint really juicy and the cheese is fantastic.  We shared the truffle fries and onion rings. Personally, I liked the onion rings better, they were light and not oily. The sauces they give you are also very good. Both of my sisters really enjoyed their burgers, one is vegetarian and got the portobello mushroom burger she loved it and it did look very tasty, the other one got the blue cheeseburger she was very satisfied with the burger. All in all we all really enjoyed our food and would definalty come back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you expect for a burger with the backing of Gordon Ramsay. In my opinion it is reasonably priced $15-22 depending which burger you get. Even the truffle fries priced at $12 is not bad especially if you share with one other person.   The only con is see is because of the wait time- but for me that doesn't warrant losing a star. If you plan accordingly and go off peak times, you should be okay.  I do not believe they have a reservation list. I came on a Monday at approx 6:30pm with my parents, we waited about 15 mins for a table (or could have been seated right away at the bar high tables). But when we came out a while later, there was a line all the way to the gaming tables- yes still on a Monday night. I've gone on a Saturday during peak time before and have waited almost 2 and a half hours for a table for 4. So don't do it and let it spoil everything.  The service was great, and the burgers are not monstrous. You will feel full and satisfied but not bloated, even with the fries. I recommend that everyone try this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Always tasting great and service is amazing. The manager always comes to our table to check how we're doing and if there's anything he can do to make our experience better."}
{"text":"What I ordered was only worth 2 stars.. I'm sure the other burgers might be good. The truffle fries was not good, and the lobster & shrimp burger wasn't either. I didn't taste any lobster.. i'm vietnamese and while eating the burger all I could think about is fish cakes my parents make. That's what resemble the patty's taste to me.. 5 of my other family members also got the lobster and shrimp burger. They didn't like it, but I think the other 6 enjoyed their beef patty burgers. Next time I'll know not to get a seafood patty for a burger lol"}
{"text":"No.  Its not all that.  I made the mistake of ordering the pan seared lobster and shrimp burger, which our waitress, who was very attentive by the way, said was a favorite on the menu.  The menu didn't describe it as a patty.  Which is what they made this burger into, and not a good one.  The flavors just really didn't go together.  Lobster meat should never be made into a patty for F@cks sake!  I should have gone with a regular burger:("}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy watching Gordon Ramsay's shows and how dedicated he is to making his food perfect. We decided to dine here for lunch on a Thursday morning. We came a bit after they opened. Surprisingly, there are already a lot of people seated! The seating weren't as comfortable and really close together. We were seated next to another couple and basically watched them eat their burgers.   The menu offers a bunch of different items such as appetizers, soups, salads, and list of burgers to pick from. We ordered   *Farmhouse¬†Burger 15 dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon, fried egg - My husband loves fried egg in burgers. This was juicy and really delicious.   *Crown Burger 15 aged mimolette cheese, arugula, fine herb a√Øoli, dried tomatoes - I ordered this as I love arugula and aioli. I cut in half but it was so good that I finished the half in three bites.  True Parmesan Fries 11 - Enough for sharing. I would not order individual fries. We finished about 4/5 of our fries. The aioli sauce that came with it was bomb. Definitely the fries to get if you are dining here.   Overall, the experience was very good. One of the better burgers we've had."}
{"text":"Best burger my daughter has ever had! All 4 of us tried different burgers. Yummy! Cesar's salad was great we split it this is half size! Want to find out if he has other burger restaurants anywhere else! Want to go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ever had. My boyfriend and I shared the truffle fries and they were phenomenal! We were just back in Vegas and disappointed that we didn't eat here again. We'll definitely go back next time we're there. There was a really long line so we sat at the bar but the service was still great there. We enjoyed watching them prepare everything. Gordon himself even stopped in which was awesome. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was in a Food coma the food was so rich and good. Line gets crazy long but food is worth the wait. Get there before they open when the line first starts. Anything on the menu is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Overrated! A tasty burger but I guess you can't expect to get Gordon Ramsay class meal in 30$"}
{"text":"Burgers aren't normally my thing, and Im typically disappointed with restaurants that have big name chefs associated with them, but I reluctantly agreed to eat here with some friends after a Britney show. Holy sh*t, this is all I wanna eat the rest of my time in Vegas! I got the blue cheese burger and it was hands down THE BEST burger I have ever ate in my entire life!!! Everyone at my table ordered a different one and they all agreed... Best burger they've ever had. The staff was welcoming, knowledgeable, fast, and friendly... but honestly the staff coulda been rude and I still would've given this spot 5 stars because the food was that good. OHHH I almost forgot! The creme br√ªl√©e shakeeee! I died."}
{"text":"My wife doesn't like turkey burgers like I do, but she lived this one!  I really was surprised by how big and thick yet juicy and flavorful it was.  The only thing I didn't like was that they charged $12 for a small order of truffle fries.  My burger was only $2 more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a good experience here.  Split a hog burger and ultimate cheeseburger.  Service is top notch, but it's a tad on the expensive side -- two burgers, fries, onion rings, and a tip for $66.  Taste-wise it was really good, with perfect levels of seasoning.  Oddly, though, after getting our food our server was sure to tell us how expensive this food would be if we got it anywhere else.... OK?"}
{"text":"Completely worth the wait! The poutine fries were to die for and they're burgers are perfect! They also had some great craft beers on tap.  We would absolutely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and the potato chip nachos. Also awesome. Definitely coming back to try the other burgers. Service was super fast. Very friendly server and she knew her stuff. Ashley was fantastic"}
{"text":"Wow, This was an amazing place and an amazing burger.  The wait was about an hour but well worth it.  The price was reasonable for Las Vegas.  The food was to order and the appetizer was good.  Definitely go here for lower priced Gordon Ramsay cuisine."}
{"text":"It's good. It's worth all the hype. Great burger, great sides, great service, and the wait isn't too long either. Highly recommend eating here when in town. For eating on the strip, it's reasonably priced. That being said you are easily $60 with tip for two people. Check it out!"}
{"text":"WOW.  Let's start with the onion rings. No doubt the best I've ever had and I ordered them as appetizer at the suggestion of my waitress Julia to nibble on while they make my Backyard Burger. Great suggestion. Now it's time to move on to the Backyard Burger. The burger was delicious, sweet pickles were a great addition to the burger. Lettuce, onions and tomatoes were fresh. So with all that being said. Hats off to this amazing burger.  Ok. What about dessert? I had to try the Cream Br√ªl√©e Oreo Shake.  It sounded good on the menu and was even better on the taste buds. Great food and service makes this an easy  5 Star Review from me."}
{"text":"Two people in my party complained about the food but mine was pretty good.  It's a neat atmosphere and my meal was what I expected.  I do think it's overpriced for what you get.  However the burger is really good."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here from service to food!  Hostess greeted us promptly and provided a very accurate wait time. Once seated, our server was very prompt and exceptionally courteous.   After making our selections for drinks and food arrived rather quickly. The lettuce wrap for burgers is very well done and I was actually able to hold it and eat it and not use a fork and knife like I do at most places. The Parmesan truffle fries were fantastic! Definitely order these! They were perfect!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try since we are locals and have our of town guests visiting and has heard of this guys t.v show. The waitress asked if they wanted fries with their burgers and they said yes.  I saw chips on the menu and didn't know it was also fries I figured actual chips? Either way the food came out cold and boring not what this guy Gordon Ramsey would allow on his tv show so I too wanted to throw a fit like he does on the show but showed way more class. Not worth a $17 burger and $8 cold fries. Normally I'd give a place a second chance but they weren't even busy enough to excuse for the cold food."}
{"text":"Got the blue burger at the bar. Ordered it medium (comes out pink but not raw). They brought it out after about 20 minutes. The burger looked great (see photo). As for the taste, I was underwhelmed. Given this burger is about the blue cheese, I was surprised how little blue cheese flavor came through. Certain bites showcased the cheese and figgy jam nicely, but too many did not. Like the cheese, I wanted more jam than what was provided.   The meat itself was okay. If you want a juicer burger, you may want to try it medium rare. For a gourmet burger, I found it fairly generic.   The bun was solid. Not spectacular, but fresh, tasty, and the multicolored sesame seeds were nice.   I paid ~$21 total with tax and tip. My burger was $16.   Takeaways:  -if I could do it again I'd order the forest burger (I'm a fan of mushrooms and bacon on burgers, and the duck bacon sounded good) -worth trying for the experience, and the menu has several burger options, but don't expect to be blown away"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a few days and decided to give this place a try because it was where we were staying.  We started off with potato chip nachos.  OMG, it was delicious.  We also got the hells burger and hot dog.  They were both super delicious.  The hot dog was just a little to smokey for me, but that was my only complaint.  We also ordered the plain fries that came with a curry and chipotle ketchup.  The fries were just ok, I dont think it is worth $9.  The curry ketchup was a fail.  But over all I will be back when im in Vegas and ive been telling everyone I know to go."}
{"text":"Ordered a farmhouse burger and took an hour and 20 mins to get it to my table. Never coming back"}
{"text":"I have to say the Hell's Kitchen burger was BOMB! It  was worth my money, so much flavor i would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time on a Friday afternoon around 2pm, waited in line for about 10 mins (reservation not needed).   SERVICE - As good as it gets! Very friendly staff all around. Our server was great and very accommodating even though we only ordered a burger and a soup for snacks.   AMBIENCE - Very lively and crowded but you don't feel cramped. Great place for lunch or a snack when you need a break from the casino :p  [HELLS' KITCHEN BURGER] - $17 - Perfectly done. The jalapeno (actually spicy) and roasted tomatoes added a very nice kick to the flavor. The patty was super tender and juicy. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  [CHEDDAR ALE SOUP] - $9 - Overly salty..... How is Gordon Ramsay ok with this?! (our server was kind enough to take this off our bill)"}
{"text":"Finally tried Gordon Ramsay burger, I've attempted to come many times before but the line was always super long. I stopped by late Friday night and there was no wait at all. We ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was just okay, the avocado pieces were cut way too big and we had to take them out and cut them in thinner slices. Also ordered the Hog burger and it was really good, I would recommend, the patty was wrapped with bacon and all the flavors worked well together. We also ordered a side of truffle fries and it was not worth it at all for $11 it was too salty and it was giant steak fries. I think it would be better if they were regular thinner fries. The creme br√ªl√©e Oreo shake was amazing, I would recommend as well. Overall I would probably return if there was no wait."}
{"text":"I had written a review previously for Burger PRE-renovation but after coming here not too long before the renovation in mid-March, I have to admit small details disappointed me on our last visit a few weeks AFTER the renovation, and would disappoint the great Mr. Ramsay himself as well.   My family (fianc√©, my pregnant sister & her husband, my big sister & her young daughter) and I came during the late afternoon and were told there'd be a 35 minute wait but were actually seated quickly. We noticed there was a slight change in decor and table setup, but for the most part things looked nice and new. At the table we were given the menus and ipad.   IMMEDIATELY my sisters noticed that their favorite jalape√±o poppers were abolished. Lol. New burgers were introduced but they kept my favorite Hell's Kitchen, and changed up the farm burger to a farmhouse, with a different cheese. Basic sides were the same. I thought I'd like to try the forest burger next.   We were waiting a solid 15 minutes before our server came and asked what we would like to drink. She was busy I could tell but I felt that she was also flying through everything, NOT in a good way. As a former server I could just feel the tension from her juggling us, adding us to her pile of mounting mental madness.   We ordered quickly (my sisters pushing for them poppers to no avail), and then waited a lengthy 40 minutes for our food. When our food came, presentation was not as it had been before. My fianc√© had a piece of old cheese melted and stuck to his plate from either another plate or from a bad dishwashing. Our server had also forgotten one order of fries which we waited til the end of our meal for. We all needed refills for tea a few minutes into our entrees because they had not been filled after we had gotten them.  Although I have had the Hell's Kitchen burger a few times previously, it wasn't the same as it used to be. I feel like in the name of profit, the restaurant has become more for tourists and not for taste. Before, whenever we got our bill I had always thought \"I can't believe I'm paying so little for such a great meal and time.\" Now, when we got the bill I thought \"This is just another typical Strip Burger joint bill for a typical Strip Burger experience\". Which is sad, because it had always been a place we loved to go for a treat on the Strip every other month or so, and whenever we had friends or family in town.   Needless to say, we all won't be returning. Sorry, Gordon."}
{"text":"Prepare for a lineup. Hubby, baby and I were staying at PH so every time we walked by there was a line, no matter what time of day. They don't take reservations. We decided to brave it on our last night at the hotel. We waited 45 mins. We had a view of the kitchen and were shocked to see a guy without a beard net on his beard.  Our waiter was friendly. There are lots of unique burgers to choose from. I wasn't feeling brave tho so I ordered the backyard burger. Hubby got the Hell's Kitchen burger. We also shared the Oreo milkshake with creme br√ªl√©e on top. Unfortunately, fries don't come with the burgers, they are sold separately.  I got my burger cooked well done and hubby got medium. Two bites into my burger I realized that there wasn't any ketchup or sauce on it at all. It's also not provided at the table. I decided to roll with my sauceless burger and actually quite enjoyed it. The lack of ketchup and mustard allowed me to take notice and enjoy the flavour of the grilled burger and the delicious American cheddar cheese. I really enjoyed all the individual flavours.  Hubby was not blown away with his burger. He was expecting to have the best of the best and said it definitely didn't meet his expectations.  The milkshake was yummy and certainly big enough for the two of us.  Not very baby/stroller friendly."}
{"text":"This was an amazing burger !!!!!! Me and my boyfriend both for different ones and they were both awesome. Line was out the door all the days we were down here but we went here in our last night in town and luckily it was no wait. Eat here !!!!"}
{"text":"$16 dollar burgers without fries. A little expensive, but the meat is so tender and in my opinion worth it.   What we ordered:   Appetizer- nachos. These were great. They come with meat and some sort of sauce. They could reduce the sauce and add a little more meat but they were good!   My fianc√© ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger: a little too spicy to enjoy it. The peppers are HOT so just know that. I took a bite and couldn't believe how hot the peppers were! Fianc√© says it was still delicious  My burger: the farm burger wit a fried egg =delicious. 5 stars.  Check it out. Although  expensive it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh my god! The meat the meat the meat! I got my burger medium and I couldn't have made a better choice! The flavors exploded in my mouth!!!! Who needs anything else on it besides the cheese! The bun was unusual and not like anything I had had before. But it was very good and soft and paired well with the burger. The fries were a cut above and the ketchup was more than I'd expected.  A curry ketchup and a chipotle ketchup. I preferred the curry. Well worth going to."}
{"text":"It's not worth it. We waited in line for 40 minutes starting at 3:45 pm. If you're in a party of two, they won't take your phone number and send a text when a table is ready. You just have to stand there.   My knees were aching by the time we finally sat down. The food is good, but it was also expensive ($62 for two burgers including $4 for a tiny bit of avocado, lemonade, and a shared order of fries.   So wait time + expense means I won't go again. If they start using text messages or buzzers for parties of two, maybe. But no way will I stand in a 40 minute line again so I can pay $25 for a burger)."}
{"text":"Went in with high expectations after a 30min wait. My fries and brown butter milkshake were delicious. However my chicken sliders were rubbery and if Gordon Ramsay himself was eating them he'd go \"f*ck me.. this is ghastly\""}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint . There was a long line but if you are diamond card or greater you can skip that . This 30 minutes wait at prime time only had us waiting 3 minutes .   Service was a little slow but the place was packed . Every table on a Monday night taken .   The draft beer list is is 30ish beers Long . Great for a strip non yard house restaurant    There were 3 of us for dinner .   Poutine fries - duck bacon !! Cheese and gravy  Hell's Kitchen burger -really good burger packing some heat .  Crown burger - mimolette cheese ! One of my favorite cheeses .   Overall top top burger spot in town . The Bill for the 3 items above and two draft beers $68.00 .  Not too bad and definitely worth it for the quality of burgers ."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when going here. I thought it might be one of those places people go just for the name of Gordon Ramsay. The Hell's Kitchen burger was absolutely incredible. It was moist, cooked perfectly (medium just how asked) and the bun was just the right amount of toasted. We also got the truffle fries which were delicious. The aioli that comes on the side is something you will just have to try! We will be back here again. The Only thing I didn't enjoy is that they didn't have any kind of kids options so our 4 year old helped us with the fries and had some crackers."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait in line for a long time but that's OK because they have a wonderful view of a fire wall on display in the window m. the burger that I got had fried egg in it and the meat was a little tuff."}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere, good food, good selection of draft beers. Good, attentive and prompt service.  Hells' kitchen burger - Perfectly cooked with excellent choice of condiment combinations.  Must try IMO.  Curried shrimp salad- Perfectly seasoned and cooked shrimps with fresh and balanced salad. Highly recommended.  Hellfire chicken wings - Great flavor and great choice of wing section. It will be better if it's more spicy or have a choice to pick how spicy.  Baby black kale apple Caesar salad -  Nice salad. Wish there were more kale and the croutons were not soggy."}
{"text":"My husband and I are not from Vegas and whenever we think of it our mouths water over the thought of Ramsay Burger's shakes. Whaaaat!!! You have not had a great great shake until you try these.  In four days we can easily order 10 of them. They cost around $9 but it is totally worthy. Their creme br√ªl√©e one with either chocolate or cookies and cream ice cream OMG. I crave it all the time and I do not even have a sweet tooth. Also, forget about eating healthy, we are talking SHAKES. They are big and filling. They may take a bit to make but again, worth the wait. The staff in the front is helpful, some more than others but the servers, the manager and the food make up for it.  Cannot recommend it enough."}
{"text":"For dinner we order hummus. It was outstanding.  However for the main course i ordered veg burger which you not pleasing.  I am vegetarian and served with a burger that looks like meat and tastes like meat is not appetizing.  I hope Ramsey reconsider his recipe for veg burger.  It is not worth paying extra $6 for it."}
{"text":"You might have to wait to get a table, but overall the  experience was very good. A good selection of very flavorful burgers, but I was not a big fan of the truffle fries. Everything else including the service was top notch!"}
{"text":"After waiting in line over 45 minutes, ordered our food. Got there refill of Pepsi (?). We still did not get a single pice of our food. That's pathetic.    Food came!   Soggy fries Under cooked bacon  Terrible service   The worst ever experience.   Topical Vegas attitudes, big entitlement"}
{"text":"Just, YUM. $$$$, but YUM! We waited a bit for a table and it was expensive but it was worth it. Possibly the best burger I've ever had eating out. We also had the poutine and, again, YUM."}
{"text":"We came here around 10pm on Memorial Day weekend & were pretty excited to try it out since everyone had said it was amazing. We were seated within 10 minutes and a waiter came to take our order shortly after. We decided to share a burger and couldn't decide between the farmers or the Hell's Kitchen burger so the waiter told us to try the Hell's Kitchen burger and add an egg for $3. We also ordered a cheddar ale soup. The servers seemed to be gossiping amongst themselves the whole time; we were seated near the kitchen area so we could see & hear everything such as which tables sent their food back & which tables were complaining, etc because the servers were talking pretty loudly. Also, our food took forever to come out; I think we waited for at least half an hour for our one burger to arrive at the table. By the time it arrived, we were so hungry that we didn't even notice that they had forgotten our egg until we were almost done with the burger. We informed our server & he looked at our food and asked if we wanted to get the egg now -- obviously we didn't because we only had a few bites of burger left -____- the cheddar ale soup was good but a little too salty. The burger itself was pretty good, but the overall experience and wait was blahhh."}
{"text":"Originales y creativas las hamburguesas, pero para ser un chef, desilusionado y atormentado que las papas fritas estuvieran crudas. Esperaba m√°s de un chef tan conocido no solo en Europa sino en Am√©rica"}
{"text":"I will be coming here again and again! I had to try this place out, because I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan. This place did not disappoint! We had about a 15 minute wait to get seated for lunch on a Monday. I had the farmhouse burger with truffle fries. As far as burgers go, they are a little pricey, but well worth it. I couldn't even finish my fries because I was so full. The fries were so good that I tried to mimic the recipe when I got home from the trip, by using left over duck fat from a big family dinner. In conclusion the best way to rate this restaurant is NOM NOM NOM!!!"}
{"text":"This isn't a review of the food at Gordon Ramsay Burger - but rather my parties' experience - and specifically the customer service at this establishment.  My wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating my 50th birthday with 2 other couples on 2/17/2018.  It was during the dinner hours and were happy that the wait for our party of 6 was only 30 minutes.  We were all excited to try his restaurant - having been fans of the TV program and having dined at another higher end Ramsey restaurant on previous business travel to Las Vegas.  Upon putting in our reservation at the hostess stand, we stepped to the bar, placed an order for 6 cocktails ($75 for the round of beverages), and began to watch the Winter Olympics on the TV at the bar.  After a few minutes a hostess approached my wife and explained that we couldn't stand were we were  (at the bar).  Upon surveying the area - I at first thought that the server was saying that we couldn't stand near the area of the bar where they pick up bar orders (i.e. near the rail) or we were in the way of the servers -- we were not.  I totally understand this -- so I made a point of moving down, making certain that we were well clear of the server area.  A few minutes later the server returned -- and very RUDELY told my wife and friends that we \"YOU NEED TO MOVE\"  (no \"please\" and in a very rude tone)  *** Important note *** several seats were EMPTY at the bar.   I explained we were having our drinks that we had just ordered -- and the server explained that it was \"against policy\" and that we would have to stand outside of the restaurant \"on the carpet\".  We walked back to the hostess stand --  I requested an explanation of the policy from the hostess and she reiterated the same.  Not satisfied with this, I requested to speak with the manager.  He came over - apologized, but said that was \"the policy\" -- the bar was \"full service\" and we would have to wait outside of the area.  I explained to him that I had just ordered a round of drinks and pointed out that ample seating was available -- I suppose I could understand if they had diners at the bar... but not really ... these weren't \"tables\" in the bar ... this was \"the bar\" -- and we were customers!  Unbelievable!   I explained to the manager that my friends and I were all frequent Las Vegas business patrons -- and didn't appreciate the terrible customer service.  Even if it was a \"policy\" - the server had no excuse to speak to my wife in such a rude and inappropriate manner.  He apologized for that (indicating he would speak to her) and offered to attempt to seat us -- but at this point I couldn't see giving the establishment another dollar.  Before leaving, I returned to the bar to put my $14 cocktails in \"go cups\" and the bartender also apologized for the policy.  Very unfortunate as I had enjoyed my other experience at GR restaurants - but given this experience will not return on future business or leisure trips.   I've been to many restaurant bars in my years of business and leisure travel -- but never experienced a policy like this - nor been treated so rudely.  Las Vegas has many great restaurants with exceptional customer service -  and we experienced several over our long weekend --- Gordon Ramsey Burger is not one of them."}
{"text":"A good burger place. You can stick with the norm or you can try something a little bit different. Service was fine, fast and efficient."}
{"text":"got the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($17), which was cooked perfectly (medium rare, as requested), an order of their regular fries ($8), and the Wheatberry-Quinoa Salad ($15).   As burger joints go, this one was actually pretty standard (compared to Au Cheval in Chicago, or even Five Guys), and the real taste probably came from the ingredients themselves, not the way they were prepared. That being said, it's pretty hard to go wrong with a burger, and the patty itself was pretty well cooked but didn't really give it the OOMF that separates a good burger from a great one.   Salad was...okay, but looking back I probably should've tried another burger (the wheat berries and all the fruits in there made the taste quite strange)  Of course, I could've had the one \"off\" burger of the night, as this place is cram packed with at least a 1hr -1.5hr wait during dinner, and they must've been churning out burgers by the dozens. Still, if I gotta be 100% honest, Cheeseburger+Cajun Fries at Five guys for much less money vs the Hell's Kitchen Burger at Gordan Ramsey....taste-wise and value-wise, Five Guys wins xD (insert a Buzzfeed video haha)"}
{"text":"Hot Dog = Food Poisoning  I've never had food poisoning until now, thanks a lot Gordo."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of those restaurants that you must try!  Be prepared for a long wait, or piggyback onto a Diamond VIP client for speedy service.  Burgers are outstanding!  Perfectly seasoned beef, cooked to your taste.   We ordered the Ultimate Cheeseburger:  aged provolone,!dublinar, boursin cheese over 1/3 ground chuck patty. Hog burger:   Mangalista pork, bacon, BBQ pork, white cheddar, crispy onions. Truffle Parmesan fries: crispy, tasty and excellent dipping sauces. Curried shrimp salad:  curried marinated shrimp, apple cider vinaigrette  Cheddar ale soup with pretzels- tasted like beer, cheese, and soft pretzels"}
{"text":"Super tasty burgers! Didn't know how big the side of fries were so I didn't end up finishing it. Only reason why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 5 was because our waiter sucked!! His name was Chase and he seemed to be in another world or just purposely ignored us the whole time. He would help all the tables around us but he wouldn't help us. After we got our food he did not come once to ask if we needed anything. We waited sooo long to get our check even after another waiter told him we were asking for it!! It was ridiculous. Other than that the food was great."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You get your money worth at this place. I ordered the farm house burger. It was delicious. I also ordered the truffle fries which too were delicious.   The waitress was great and speedy. Every time my soda was about half full, she was quick to bring me a fresh drink. AWESOME!!!!  I ordered a burger, fries and drink and left full with fries left over. This is a definite stop place if you're looking for a great burger."}
{"text":"Very good burger cooked perfectly. Fries were also great Homemade  Ketchup was the best."}
{"text":"I loved this place! We had a couple of burgers and truffle fries which were extremely delicious! And at the end of the meal we had a brown butter pecan shake and it was out of this world ! I absolutely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger places and I stop by whenever I'm in Vegas! Good food, nice setting and great drinks...you can't go wrong!There's always a line but don't be intimidated, it goes by relatively quickly! And you can always sit at the bar if you're in a rush!"}
{"text":"It truly was as good as it gets. Excellent customer service. Staff made sure to compensate for delay and unavailability of some items on the menu. Place was crowded but I can't complain."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burger restaurants I have been to in Vegas. Gordon Ramsay does not disappoint. I especially love the huge photo of him in the middle of the restaurant with his arms crossed, staring at all of his customers as if to say \"Yeah, you know that burger is delicious\"   My favorite here is actually the truffle fries. So so so good. Probably the best truffle fries ever. I have only had truffle fries as good as these in LA at a hot dog joint called Wurstkuchen.   I have ordered the Mushroom Burger here and it was ah-maaazzziiinnggg. The last time I came, I ordered the Ahi Sliders instead and pretty much doubled over, with how delicious it was. I was also a bit drunk too. My boyfriend ordered the burger with the jalapenos and the avocado in it ( can't remember what it was called) and I had a bite of it, we both loved it and didn't want to put it down.   We made some friends in the line waiting for a table and the staff was so accommodating and let us move our table to sit with our new friends.   It was also my birthday and they brought over free dessert, which was so sweet! Delicious. I don't really remember what kind of dessert it was considering how hammered I was, all I remember was that it was yummy."}
{"text":"Food was great and worth the wait! Staff was friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend you give it a shot, you'll probably be back for more! I got the hell's burger and two orders of fries for the table we would've been okay with just one for us three. Not expensive compared to other restaurants we've visited on our trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was so amazing we went two days in a row. The first day we had the Parmesan truffle fries and ahi sliders. The second day we had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Hog Burger. They were both packed full of flavor and absolutely delish. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here, so it's not like it is terrible. The burgers are fine. Because of the price and the hype, I expected them to blow my mind, but they are just ok. This time, we were there on a Tuesday afternoon, so it wasn't crowded, and yet the service was still slow. I think the part that got me was that when I flagged down a waiter from another table to point out the cockroach skittering across the floor, he didn't even speak to me; he just scooped it up in a napkin and went back to laughing with his waiter-buddy. I would have thought a comment \"oh dear\" or brief apology would have been in order. I definitely get a \"we don't care; we don't have to\" vibe from this place. Overall: Meh."}
{"text":"Great first time experience here, came early on a NFL Sunday and got table next to the bar. Server was excellent and told us all about menu and we chatted about Ramsey for a bit. Seems he drops by every couple of months to check up on things. Kinda of nice to know that he's not just selling his name.  I started with the onion ring appetizer which was probably the best I be ever had. The Maui onion lent a sweetness that really popped in my mouth like no other onion I've had. The batter was light and very flavorful and not greasy. My wife and I split the Forest  and Tandoori chicken burger and enjoyed them both, maybe a bit of an edge to the Forest because when I think of burgers I think beef, but can't go wrong with either. The service was a bit slow, but I don't mind when the product is this good. It is a busy restaurant and they want to make sure the experience is good, so just don't go if you're in a rush.  If you want quick service go to McDonald's. The only negative from me is the dining room is a bit bleh, just cafe style. Would have been nice to have been a little more upscale. But overall, I highly recommend and cannot wait to go back and try more items next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Huge GR fan , I love that man ! So of course  I had to try this place out . Being my first time here I had to order a little of everything   and it was definitely  worth it . Once seated service was great  and our waiter made awesome recommendations.  Once we got our food .. AMAZING .... jalape√±o poppers ...awesome ...gooey fries...delicious!I'm not a big duck fan but it was simply amazing ...we also had the  truffle fries ...which were cooked to perfection with amazing dip...ONLY one thing ...I sent my burger back because I did order my burger medium well and it was a little over well done ..nonetheless they redeemed themselves with a Hell's Kitchen  burger cooked to perfection. Of course I'll be back because I LOVE GR!"}
{"text":"We are fans of Gordon Ramsay and would love to try out his restaurants without breaking our piggy banks, so we decided to try Gordon Ramsay burger next after trying Gordon Ramsay fish and chips!  We started to wait for our turn since 7pm on a Tuesday evening and it took us about an hour to get a table for two. Our nice and friendly server gave us really clear explanations on items on menu and he even gave us a heads-up that our food would take at least 45 minutes to prepare, as the kitchen was busy.  We ordered the following for two of us without any sides, so as to not over feed our tummies: 1) \"Foie\" burger  The foie gras is just a spread on the bun. We weren't able to taste the foie gras spread as the taste of port wine aioli had overpowered the taste of foie gras spread. We probably won't recommend this burger, as it didn't look as appetizing as other burgers served on other tables. 2) Wheatberry-Quinoa salad The chicken skewer was tender and it went really well with the salad. The salad is slightly on a sour side. If there is some sweet mandarin oranges or sweet peaches added to this salad, this will be perfect! The portion is good to share among 3 or 4 people.   We will still go back to try other burgers."}
{"text":"So, I totally love this place. Been here three times and will continue to come back when I'm in Vegas.   I reviewed GR Burgr when it was at the \"other location\" but it was lost on yelp due to the alleged relocation. However, the restaurant never moved, maybe they redecorated, but it's still at the same spot in the Planet Hollywood resort right off the strip.   Parking is a B! The PH parking is in the back of the resort and the attached miracle mile mall. It's a true workout to walk from the parking garage to the restaurant so you'll be good to chow down when you get there.   We ordered four burgers and three sides and three drinks bill was $126. Well worth the price. The burgers are always juicy and delicious. There are a bunch of different topping combinations on the menu to chose from.   My beef (lol) with them is (1) they exchanged the goat cheese off of the crown burger for a melty cheese which is still good but not the same, and, (2) the chips, or as we call them fries, are dry. Idk if that how they like them in England but I stick with the sweet potato fries and the onion rings for sides because both of them are awesome.  Even with these two beefs, it's still the BEST burger restaurant I've been to. If you're on the fence, just go."}
{"text":"So sad... one of my favorite Las Vegas stops has gone to dumpster. For several years now I have made a tradition of eating here when in town for our annual trade show. This time was just so bad! First of all, after waiting in line for thirty minutes (understandable in the past) we were seated. Then it was no less then 15 minutes before a server came to our table. After we placed our order it took 40 minutes to get our food and even then the order was wrong. I asked to speak to the manager and instead of taking responsibility, which he should have (since these are management issues), he walked away saying he wanted to talk to the server. She returned with a check which instead of comping our meal or at the very least removing the entree that was wrong, he had the waitress remove the automatic 20% gratuity. Just so bad. If Gordon Ramsey new what was going on, heads would roll. We tipped the waitress anyway and left a tip for the manager (a note about what an ahole he was!\""}
{"text":"Had the Farmhouse Burger. One of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Great atmosphere, super friendly staff, excellent food. Five stars easy."}
{"text":"The wings are worth trying. They are a good size and have a great flavor. We paid around $75 for a party of two. The food taste good, but it's not the best I have ever had. It's all about the hype. Just a one time thing. Wasn't too impressed. Great service."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the high standards you see during the tv shows. There wasn't anything negative about our lunch experience and we absolutely loved the food!!   Parmesan truffle fries and farmhouse burger were perfectly prepared and DELICIOUS!!!!   You'll need to wait in a line to get in, but it moves rather quickly. Once seated and your order is placed, it does take about 40-45 mins to receive your food (which seems like forever when your hungry) but the results are worth the wait."}
{"text":"Our first night in Vegas for a work event and headed to burger. One of our friends had come here before and raved about it. We waited, maybe 20 minutes,  which wasn't too bad. We all ordered different items and had great service.  But what grossed us all out was that there was a baby cockroach crawling across the floor right by our feet in a walkway for customers and staff.  One busboy saw me see the cockroach, stepped on it, looked back at me with an \"oh $hit\" look on his face and scooted the cockroach from where he stepped on it towards the kitchen . Yes, the kitchen!! We never spoke to a manager because we were completely grossed out. The food was excellent but the bug issue totally turned us off. Call an exterminator,  Gordon!"}
{"text":"As advertised. All types of fries are amazing. Burgers outstanding. Great place if you don't want a fancy dinner or fast food."}
{"text":"Only wish you guys had brought back the jalape√±o poppers!!! Gordon, please bring them back!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner here last night after the Britney concert. We had to wait about 20 minutes and were seated at the bar. The bartenders were great and attentive. I ordered the wings and my husband ordered the ultimate cheese burger and onion rings. Best we have ever had. Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"The wait is long, but it's worth it if you have your heart set on it.  I'm not the biggest burger fan, but the patty was thick and juicy at medium-doneness without turning the bun into a hemoglobin sponge. I got the forester which has truffled goat cheese and duck bacon. There was plenty of truffle flavor, but the duck bacon wasn't anything memorable. It wasn't the best burger I've had, but it was still top notch.  My favorite part of the meal was the appetizers. The kettle chip nachos taste like an upgraded version of something you might find at the Tilted Kilt. They were good, but the hell fire wings were better. They're cut so that they're easier to eat, and they're fried perfectly so that the skin is crispy while leaving the meat moist. The buffalo sauce is not too hot and slightly sweet, but it's more like a glaze such that it doesn't ruin the crispy texture. Finally, they're topped with some blue cheese. I loved them. Still, my favorite dish was the truffle fries, and that's solely because of the truffle aoli. The truffle scent from the aoli dominates the atmosphere no matter what else you have on your table. It looks thick and heavy, but it instantly melts into a rich cloud of truffle flavor once it's in your mouth. I could've stuck my straw in the sauce cup.  Finally, that oreo creme brulee shake is great if you like rich desserts. The creme brulee pudding layer is very sweet and heavy, and the oreo milk shake layer is runny with no iciness. Getting a little bit of both in each sip is key.  While Gordon's was great, I don't feel right giving it 5 stars when comparing it to other world class burger joints. For example, I still think Chicago's Au Cheval has a much better burger. Still, it's worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Drool. I've been somewhat underwhelmed with some of the food we have had while in Vegas. And my hunt for something healthy and tasty has been challenging... This place is in no way healthy, but OMG is it delicious. I got a caramel butter pecan shake with my burger and truffle fries. I literally moaned and talked about the shake the whole time I was drinking it. And it was gone by the time our burgers and fries came out. The burger had 3 cheeses on it and was made perfectly. The truffle fries were the best I've ever had... And this may sound odd, but the chairs were so comfortable. It was a nice place to relax for a few after roaming around the strip. And I like the pyrotechnic decor at the entrance. It's a nice touch."}
{"text":"Being a fan of all things GR I've been here a few times.  It's a great place for Hell's Kitchen fans to reminisce about the episode/competition filmed here.  It is really too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"First, you give the hostess your number and they will text you when you're up. You have 10 minutes to get back. Great idea!  I got a turkey burger with fries and onion rings.  Burger patty was delicious but the bread was so forgettable. The patty itself had that smoky over flames on the grill flavor and was quite moist. Fries were subpar; I've definitely had better.  Onion rings were a dream. They are thick, juicy, flavorful, and addicting. Covered in parmesan cheese, I couldn't get enough. The ranch was amazing too as it is made with little bits of cheese that compliment the onion rings perfectly.  Service was good. Our waiter actually suggested that instead of us each getting our own fries, we share as there quite large. He was right. Thanks for the tip!"}
{"text":"Food awesome.  Long waits and pricey.  But the burger was the bomb.  Truffle fries should be shared.  Little pricey but good.  Long waits n"}
{"text":"Don't need to post the food. Wait time is a horrific 2 1/2 plushours. Okay its the New Year's weekend, but we started waiting at 10:15 p.m. on the couples line. The hostess at the front desk never informed us that a party of three or more needs to check-in for a table. We waited at the couples line for 45 minutes.   Once we got to the front of the line, we were informed that we needed to check-in for a party of three or more. We barely had our name on the list at that time. We waited an extra 40 minutes. I complained to the manager on duty that they should post signs in front of their establishment about check-in procedures. They shouldn't put signs that aren't visible at the couples line. They also should have their hostesses inform guest about their check-in procedures.  Meanwhile, after being seated at 11:40 p.m., we're still waiting for our food at 12:27 a.m. NEVER GO HERE."}
{"text":"Best Burger in Vegas/the world. The Hell's Kitchen Burger and off the menu F-word burger are both outstanding. Parm fries and onion rings will be the best you ever eat. They both come with 2 flavorful sauces that will blow your mind. Whiskey lemonade and Caribbean Dreams to accompany the meals were awesome and refreshing.  If you get there when they are opening don't panic at the huge line- it moves fast and the food is very much worth the wait.  Server was excellent. They are quick service and delivery, but you don't feel rushed out the door.  The atmosphere is casual and fun and the food presentation is on point! Fire feature adds a lot to the experience.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Expect it to be very busy! If you have a party of 3 or more, walk up to the hostess without waiting in line and inquire your reservation. There is also a sign with its instructions too if you did wait in line like me without reading the huge prints!! Lol the line is only lent for parties of 2 or less. When you request your reservation from the hostess, they ask for a contact number to send you a text when the table is ready for seating. Usually takes about 30 minutes wait time to get our table, so just stick around the area and/or do a little shopping.   I love the seating arrangements. There's quite a few bar areas and good lighting especially if you're next to the glass wall of fire .  Let's talk about their menu! It's like a British flag  that unfolds like an origami!! Lol jk more or less.   Now let me talk about the service! Gordon Ramsay trained their crew perfectly, cuz when you talk gourmet burger, my tastebuds felt gourmet expectations lol All the servers are very keen on our needs and all ways checked back on our table for feedback.   I purchased a Forest Burger = tremor cheese, forest mushrooms, duck bacon $15, Farm House Burger = dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon, fried egg $15, and Sweet Potato Fries $8.   I'll end this review with a famous quote, \"why did the chicken cross the road? Because it was way too f@#%*ing undercooked!\" - Gordon Ramsay"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time today and we both loved it . I had the Hell's Kitchen burger with bacon my boyfriend had the Farmhouse Burger we both really enjoyed our burger . Service was great too and the wait wasn't to bad , we will different be back here again"}
{"text":"I'm honestly not happy with any of the service I've received one bit...first of all it started with a friend of mine and I being placed at this wobbly table about the size of a nightstand that was directly next to the excessively loud kitchen(not saying the kitchen should be quiet but why have a table right next to it) but I then requested to be placed at a booth I had seen a pair of people sitting at and soon after left but the waiter said she couldn't sit us there because you need a party of 3 when I just watched a party of 2 eat Nd leave she then began to make the whole experience awkward as can be by literally staring me and my buddy in the face for about 20 seconds after we ordered....nothing said, just a weird blank stare and she continued to do this for the remainder of my stay.... I then requested to have a side of ranch which took 3 reminders to finally get and also never got a refill throughout the whole night I've been here before and spent countless hours and dollars at this establishment but I have yet to be absolutely satisfied with my stay nothing on my table that night was served properly and it's a shame I had to experience this but nobody is perfect even a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant."}
{"text":"The food at Gordan Ramsay did not disappoint. I ordered one of the more popular items on the menu (Hells' Kitchen Burger - $16). For the name and the quality, I would say that the burger is definitely worth the hype.  The only complaint I have is the wait time. I came with a party of 9 and we were promised a wait time of 45 minutes to 1 hour which is what we had anticipated; however, our wait time gradually increased until it hit 2 hours and 30 minutes.   On the bright side, the manager was very sincere and provided two plates of mushroom poutine on him.   Overall, I would recommend the place if you are in a smaller party (2-4) and willing to wait in a line for about 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"I recommend the Farm house burger!  Be adventurous and trust the fried egg!.  The Parm fries were also good."}
{"text":"Lots of times a \"celebrity\" restaurant falls flat...not in this case!  While they do not take advanced reservations, the line moves rather quickly, so don't get frustrated!  We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Bleucheese Burger along with a (mandatory) order of Truffle Parmesan Fries. Let's put it this way...the BEST burger I've ever had!  Don't fret, you will thank me later!!"}
{"text":"Had the Blue Cheese Burger and it was phenomenal. One of the best tasting burgers I've had!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. The food was DELICIOUS, TASTE WAS excellent,  BEST BURGER in vegas! Get the Hells kitchen burger. You won't regret it. Very happy with the quality of food here, this chefs resturant did not disappoint unlike guy fierries. This one you won't be disappointed that's forsure"}
{"text":"This place is sure popular at all times! We waited about an hour and a half to be seated. When we ate here in April (I know, super late review), they were in the process of switching over the menu so the server notified us of a back up in the kitchen and that the food could take up to 45 minutes to come out. Kind of annoying after having waited so long for a table, but whatever. The Tandoori Chicken burger was great. I really liked the vinaigrette. My husband got the U.K. Burger and really enjoyed it as well. We liked the food but felt it wasn't exactly worth the price or long wait. Overall, it's a yummy and trendy celebrity chef restaurant that you should at least try once!"}
{"text":"Love the burgers here. Every burger takes around 20minutes to make but it taste pretty good. My 2 favorites are the special 10 year anniversary burger they have and the lobster and shrimp burger. I really like the fries here, sweet potato fries with sugar coating on top and the parmesan truffle fries.    Anniversary burger - 22$, patty is delicious, can do workout the pork on the top Lobster and shrimp burger- 26$, light and tasty"}
{"text":"Great place to get some stunning burgers. I've been here three times and I've never been disappointed by the burgers or entrees.   One thing I must say about the chips (French fries) is that they can be so hard or stale sometimes. I'm not sure if this is affected by when I go in (the later I go in, the more stale the chips get), but it's a bit annoying because I love having fries with my burgers. The sauces are good but I would love some more universally friendly versions of them. I know the curry sauce had a very overwhelming spice to it.   The burgers are good. The salad (pictured) is also great. It's Gordon Ramsay, what else do you expect?   The only reason why I took two stars off was because the service is always sooooooo slow. I don't get it. I understand that it'll get a little slower when it's busy, which is fine, but even when it's not and there's barely a line, my server will always forget something or take forever to check up on me.   Otherwise, it's a great burger joint. Maybe avoid the fries if you can? Breading on the onion rings were stellar!"}
{"text":"The best burger I ever had!! All the sauces are great and milkshake was phenomenal! I'll go back to Vegas just for this place lol"}
{"text":"I tried the hog burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger as well as the curry fries and the nachos. The nachos I had here were the greatest nachos I have ever had mostly because of the English cheese sauce that they added. The fries were crispy and well done, but the curry was not as rest. Curry was decent but not really my taste. The burgers were extremely juicy and flavorful. I think I finally found a better burger place than. In-N-Out."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst burger joints I have visited in recent years. I waited 45 minutes for my order and I received terrible service. Staff behind counter were talking incessantly about non-work related affairs and servers were not attentive at all. After the ridiculously long wait, I received a burger that was dry, had no flavor and nothing at all what I expected from a restaurant with Gordon Ramsay's name branded on it. Do not come here if you are ever on the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"After waiting about 15 minutes, to get seated due to line outside of the restaurant, I was finally invited to come inside.  I ordered the hells' kitchen burger the wait for the burger and anticipation grew my curiosity why are people talking so much about the famous Gordon Ramsay Burger at Planet Hollywood. I didn't take a photo there are plenty on here anyways.  There it was the ultimate creation in front of me perfectly crafted. I had little doubt how would it taste with sesame seed bun, avocado, jalape√±os, roasted tomatos and cheese. After i took that first bite, it was like harmony of different flavors working as one not fighting but working together. I was really happy and enjoying every single bite of this masterpiece  burger. I don't know what else to say try it for yourself, I am definitely coming back for more...."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas so many times and finally had chance to try that famous burger. Maybe because i came after lunch time there was no line.  But i was so dosappinted, we ordered a hell's kitchen burger ,hog burger and truffle fries. And i asked the jalapeno on the side for my hell's kitchen burger. The fries had came first and it not crispy enough and sauce tasted very light. Then burger came i noticed there was only one set of silverware on our table. Meanwhile the buser dropped plates and cups while cleaning the table. The burger was over charred and i noticed i didnt see my jalapeno on the side after my first bit , guess where was it? yep it was inside my burger! so i just moved on the side. My server came and asked how everything i said its spicy and i thought its on the side then he just ignore what I said and walk away. Well i dont usually complain, but for the famous restaurant like that i expected more. We all know Gordon is a high standard person and thats why he is famous and successful. We expected his restaurants are same high standard. For people who want to have a nice burger i suggest you go in and out."}
{"text":"I am not just a fan but a worshipper of Gordon Ramsay and I have learnt to review a restaurant from HIM through each and every show and tweet and youtube video that he does. I am very very disappointed with the restaurant and to some extent the food. The service is very bad and the staff is clearly overworked. I ordered the Hog burger, the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the truffle fries. The Hog burger was welldone and COLD it must have been sitting around for a while. The fried we had to send back because they were stale and dry. The only good thing was the Hell's Kitchen Burger done medium well done to the T. The server was proactive and ready to replace our fried immediately but you should at least get fresh fried after 40 mins of waiting and not much crowd (most of the tables were empty since it was Sunday 10 p.m). No body likes cold fries or cold burgers. :( :("}
{"text":"This is the best burger place in Vegas. I just spent 5 days with the family in Vegas and we visited a number of burger places.    Pros - the service is terrific!!!  They have a very organize waiting process for table which is not the case at most places.  Everyone is friendly.  And food is delicious!!!  No cons  Burgers are great, also try the BBQ sandwich-I loved it.  Truffle fries are great and so are the onion rings."}
{"text":"My farmhouse burger was great. We will be going back before we leave. Also, this was by far the best customer service I have experienced in a long time. The wait staff was an example that there is no \"I\" in team."}
{"text":"Last time we were in Las Vegas we tried Gordon Ramsey's Fish n' Chips and liked it a lot. This popped up and we decided to give it a try. It is expensive for what it is, but not overly so for the venue and association. The food we have had all our life is given a different experience with different presentations, textures and flavors. Together, we shared the ale soup, Hell's Kitchen burger and onion rings. I don't think we can be regulars here, but we wouldn't mind coming back some day. Also, be prepared to wait. We came at the end of the day and there was still a small line; waiting 30-40 minutes. Others that came behind us reported the line was six times as long earlier in the day."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a challenge going here with a large party, we definitely waited much longer than just waiting in the line and sitting separately. After about a 50min wait we finally got to our seats YAY! We already knew what we wanted since we had 50min to decide before we sat. I must say it was absolutely worth the wait not to mention they make everything fresh so the burger wait time is another 30 min or so. We had these bomb truffle fries while we waited for the deliciousness. I highly recommend the Hell's Kitchen Burger with bacon so full of flavor it tasted like Heaven despite coming from the kitchen of Hell lol pardon the corniness. My son had the Hog burger which was yummy as well a 1/4 beef patty wrapped in bacon topped with pulled pork and some sweet pickles to add some balance yum. I would definitely comeback and maybe just play some machines if a wait is necessary. Thanks again Chef Gordon"}
{"text":"A must stop visit if you're a fan of Gordon Ramsey's work. That man knows how to slice and dice so lets see what his creation tastes like.   So glad that there wasn't a line or wait when we had came here. We get promptly greeted by the host and seated within minutes upon check in. The server came out to introduce himself and took our beverages and order. It was my friends and I first time eating here so the waiter was extremely helpful on pointing out which one to try. He suggested the Hell's kitchen Burger for me so I took his suggestion.  The restaurant was semi busy during the lunch rush so the food came out in a fairly decent time. Our server was amazing. He catered to our every needs so the customer service here is superb.  As I bit into the burger, I could immediately taste the seasoned, savory, juicy burger going down my esophagus. I felt the heat from the grilled jalape√±os and jalape√±os aioli spread swirling on my tongue. The egg yolk was gushing down the burger which gave it a nice syrupy coating to the sandwich. The cheese also gave it that sharp taste and creamy texture. There was so many flavors and texture happening all at once. The sesame buns was a great choice of bread. A solid burger if you were to ask me! Sweet potato fries were good as well but I could care less about it.   The ice cream smoothie dessert was great itself.  Nothing special but a delicious treat to eat none the less. Overall, it was an great dining experience for a first timer. And yes I would recommend it to a friend!"}
{"text":"Burger is not that great. Had high expectations before eating, kind of disappointed. The patty was not delicious at all."}
{"text":"True to Vegas style, Gordon Ramsay Burger has an over the top commercial vibe but a pleasant enough atmosphere. Service was pretty good. We started with the kettle chip nachos which had a decadent delicious creamy cheese sauce and tender short rib beef topping, pretty yummy. We also had the truffle Parmesan fries that were thick, crispy, while being soft on the inside, really satisfying. The burger selection was pretty impressive and definitely had something for everyone. I chose the farmhouse burger which I have to say was pretty delicious with a nice large juicy patty, thick chunks of bacon and an oozy egg. My one complaint is that the burger patty was a little under-seasoned for me. I heard no complaints about anyone else's burgers. All in all I would recommend this place if you're a Gordon Ramsey fan and your craving a solid delicious burger and satisfying pub food."}
{"text":"If the food weren't so amazingly incredible and the staff so wonderful, I'd take a star away because waiting next to the fire wall for 20 mins when you've been out in the 114¬∞ heat of Las Vegas is kind of frustrating. But geeze the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Holly Molly! I don't eat too many Burgers but... I will take Gordon Ramsay home with me forever!!!  Prime location in the Strip within the Planet Hollywood hotel. There are enough servers to take good care of the hundreds of people that have the pleasure to stop by in a daily basis.  I ordered the Blue Cheese Burger ($15) with Manchego cheese, figgy Jam, arugula, took off the Spicy Mayo and it was GLORIOUS!  The patty was perfectly cooked, it was juicy and tender but not runny, the Figgy Jam was sweet and was the perfect combination with the Blue Cheese chunks.   I also had the Truffle French Fries ($12). Steak fries, crunchy outside but soft in the inside.   The servers were welcoming and very attentive.    I will come back while in exciting Las Vegas.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"The service was very slow. It toke almost an hour to get our burgers.  Also it wasn't that tasty"}
{"text":"Best burger and great service with added bonus of being able create a chicken version to any of the burgers"}
{"text":"Not a hater by any means, but Gordan Ramsey might want to consider an undercover boss episode for his own burger joint to prove he's better at cooking than talking. The burger itself is a 3 star but considering the price and availabilities in Las Vegas, this doesn't live up to the hype at all. The worst part about the burger is the bun. The best part about Gordan Ramsey Burger is the drink refills."}
{"text":"Is it weird that I read everything on the menu in Gordon Ramsay voice?  Big dawg was huge and full of flavor. Crown burger cooked just right but feel like it needed more oomph. Still enjoyable. Parmesan truffle fries are amazing.  Wait is a little long so be prepared during prime times."}
{"text":"Came here for the weekend for my friends bday and she wanted to try Gordan Ramsay restaurants.   Order the tuna sliders for appetizer which was amazing! LOVED IT!   For entree, I order the FOIE Burger and Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Two of my most recent cravings... Foie gras and Truffles :) :) :) NOM NOM GOOD!   Got the burgers finally, took a little while. It was tasty and juicy but I didn't really see the foie in my burger and the truffles aioli was delicious, you actually saw the foie gras in the aioli. The burger was juicy and cooked to perfection. I couldn't finish it, def a big portion.   I enjoyed the burger and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to come to Vegas for an industry related event, so of course a group of us had to visit at least one of the celebrity-owned establishments on the Strip. We opted for the moderately priced Gorden Ramsay Burger, located inside Planet Hollywood and were seated faster than the given wait time (early weekday evening).  Ambience is definitely buzzing, and the establishment was smaller than expected.  Food was great, as stated by my group who had the Truffle Fries, Bleu Cheeseburger, Hell's Kitchen Burger, and their off-menu special, The F-word (in honor of G-Ram's new show).  Fries come thick-cut with 2 sauces, Hell's Kitchen was not as fiery as presumed, and the F-word was mouthwateringly delicious, with its dry-aged ribeye and short-ribs. I myself had the Tandoori Chicken burger, which was on the dry side and begging for more of the scrumptiously-described tahini & mint vinaigrettes. On the other hand, love the black & white sesame bun aesthetic.  Skip the jumbo onion rings.  Service was 3/5. Kept our waters filled but the food took a good while.  The experience was not as amazing as I expected, but I'd recommend stopping by for a good beef burger."}
{"text":"I love coming here every time I'm in Vegas!  Unfortunately, they changed their menu recently.   I always get the Hells Kitchen Burger! It has a nice heat to it. I always have to share because their burgers are pretty big.   Since they no longer have the gooey fries, I got the kettle chip nachos instead. They were a decent substitute, but still miss them!   The fries are more like steak fries. They had the texture as if the fries have been sitting under a heat lamp. It was crispy but a strange crispy.   Still coming back but I really wish thy bring back the gooey fries!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best burger.  This review is a few months late but wanted to put this here since I just did one for the Fish & Chips joint and didn't feel the same way there.  The fact that I am still craving the Hell's Kitchen burger after few months proves that it was memorable.  The patty was juicy and not heavily seasoned.  I could taste the natural flavor of the beef and each ingredient inside the burger added a different layer and dimension to the bite.  The whole burger felt thoughtful and made complete sense.  I've never felt that way about a burger before so that was a first.  I should've ditched Fish & Chips and went back here last vegas visit.    Truffle fries were superb.  I am picky about my truffle fries.  Sometimes they can feel like when you're trapped in an elevator with someone with way too much perfume.  Not this one."}
{"text":"Here's the thing...... my review is very limited because, for some bizarre reason, upon arriving in Vegas for a mini-vacation, I was battling some kind of stomach flu and/or was seriously overtired.  I did manage to take one bite of the burger my husband ordered, but that's all I could muster.  I must say, for that one bite, it was OUTSTANDING.  The beef literally melted on my tongue, and it was easy to tell it was very high quality.  The flavors were excellent, and while there was more waiting for me to eat, I just couldn't.  Everyone else devoured their burgers and 2 types of fries that were ordered (plain and truffle fries).  Oh, if only I was feeling better........ but for that one bite, yeh, I am reporting excellence on that.  Gordon Ramsey Burger is located in a very heavily smoke-filled Planet Hollywood, so if you are sensitive to smoke, beware.  Please also note that the wait-time can be quite long.... no matter what time you go !!  They do not accept reservations."}
{"text":"It's simply the best burger you will have in your life.   I did a review for this restaurant before but I see yelp created another page for it so I will update you guys on this one. This is my second time here and the experience was just as good as the first. It's located inside of Planet Hollywood not too far from PF Chang's. This time, we did have to wait about 15-20 minutes in line before being seated. The last time...we simply walked right in. If you have a group of three or more, you will be seated a lot quicker than those with just two people. The service is fantastic! Not one complaint there.   As per usual, the burger, the fries and the drinks are AMAZING! The flavor is intense and the burgers just melt in your mouth! The fries are big enough to share (try the truffle fries). As expected, it's not expensive but it's not cheap either. A drink gets is $13 and the burgers are between $15-$30.    I would recommend the Crown Burger or the Backyard burger if you are looking for something simple. I'm definitely going to try the lobster and shrimp burger next! I hear great things about it!"}
{"text":"Our table of 4 each ordered a different burger. For starters the nachos and I must say the shredded beef was delicious but with the cheese sauce and fried potato chips it was greasy overkill. Onion rings are delicious and fries are good not over the top. Ketchup = what is this imposter red sauce they serve with the fries and rings???  I get the I am Gordon Ramsey and a great chef but let's leave it at that and serve the best ketchup ever Heinz!    All the Burgers we ordered are very good! Cooked perfectly and meat has great flavor. Light handed on the sauces which is perfect for me I don't want the meat masked.   Prices are excellent!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the Total Rewards Diamond card, we were able to skip the *gulp* 2-hour wait that was quoted to another curious customer. In fact, our wait was 5 minutes max, which was great. The parmesan truffle fries were in fact kick-ass, and the Caesar salad with chicken was pretty nice (I liked the little fancy touches of 2-3 other greens besides the iceberg lettuce) and amazingly enough, adding chicken on was ONLY $1. Say what? This was two skewers of chicken freshly grilled. Usually chicken is $3 or more as a salad add-on, so I was impressed, skewer or no skewer.   The downside is, of course, the wait on the burger. Like don't come hungry, cause you will be left hungry for a-whi-le. We were quoted 25-30 minutes, but it was more in the 45 plus range. More accurately, an hour plus but we had appetizers so it didn't feel that bad. The couple next to us only ordered burgers though; it got to the point where they complained, and their burgers were delivered first with a free appetizer, so maybe it worked out?   As for our burger, we got the mushroom to split. They are able to cut some burgers in half, but ours had bacon, so it was no-go. By then, I had filled up on fries, water, salad, and wait-time, so I took two bites, one for the experience, one for good measure and gave up on the rest. It was good, but nothing I would care to order again."}
{"text":"Amazing hamburger. We stopped on a whim and we were pleasantly surprised. I don't normally eat at celebrity places (over priced and underwhelming) but this really was exceptional. We split the Bleu Cheeseburger with truffle fries. The burger also had manchego cheese and arugula lettuce. The Bleu wasn't over-powering and everything blended together nicely. The fries were a must-do as other reviewers have pointed out. The real star was the meat patty which was done absolutely perfect! I'd like to know how they do it. If you are a burger fan or would like a smaller bite for lunch, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Overrated, our family was a 2nd customer as we waited at the opening 11:00 am. Ordered, mediterranean burger, Dawg, signature Hells' burger, onion rings, milkshakes and a glass of beer: 1) waited 40 minutes for food!!! 2) Dawg visually wonderful, but tastes too salty, only finished half 3) burger too dry and again salty as well 4) However, son liked a mediterranean burger   Spent $100 including a tip, definitely overrated and it is not worth it.  Ramsay Hell's Kitchen is so much better - tastes, price, service and atmosphere, if you can get a table!"}
{"text":"A must if your in Vegas. Burgers are amazing. Try the F word burger. I would skip the fries or share them."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger. I also ordered the truffle Parmesan fries. The burger took about 30 mins to come out so i waited on the fries.  So much food! I would say share the fries The burger was delicious probably the best Ive ever had. The meat was cooked perfectly and the ingredients paired so well together i was not disappointed. I will be back to try something different."}
{"text":"Stood in line before it opened and asked to be seated at counter by kitchen as I Love watching a kitchen work. They tell you that the burgers take 25 minutes so we ordered the poutine and it was AMAZING. Creamy and rich with the burnt ends, it could almost be a meal itself. My son had the Farmhouse and he loved it. He also had the Creme Br√ªl√©e shake and all I could think of was the scene from Pulp Fiction where John Travolta asked Uma Thurman about a $5 shake and than said it was pretty good. It's REALLY good. I had the Pork Chop and Applesauce Burger cooked medium and it was super flavorful. My only mistake was ordering a side of fries, not that they weren't good, they were, but I had them w the poutine. I wished our server had suggested something different. Staff was friendly and I noticed that all of them were unusually attractive, so certainly an incentive to wait in line. The only thing missing was the yelling from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I used to love Burg(e)r but I'm disappointed in the recent menu changes. A few of my favorite items are gone but thankfully the Hell's Kitchen burger stayed. I tried the ale cheddar soup, which was just barely lukewarm so that was a little disappointing. Something was off with the staff tonight as well. Would've been 4 stars if my soup was warmer and the service a bit better. The seating process is also silly. If you're a party of q or 2, be prepared to stand in line for 30-45 minutes at dinner and larger parties be prepared to wait 2x that for a table. Why can't I just sign in, go gamble, and receive a text when my table is ready?"}
{"text":"The Poutine fries weren't bad; flavorful but needed a little more gravy.  The Hell's Kitchen burger disappointed me significantly.  I asked for medium rare and got a thin patty that was way over cooked. The bun was dry.  It had a little heat from the grilled jalape√±o, but I've had better burgers for the price.    Sorry Gordon, I'm a private chef and your restaurant disappointed.   On a good note, the beer was half way decent.   Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"What an opportunity to have to be in one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. Coming to Vegas, I have always been looking forward to this restaurant.  Soooooo I ordered the Forest Burger. I chose this because I saw that it has some sort of duck bacon which immediately caught my attention. Tried it and it tasted great and unique. The meat was my favorite part; It was perfectly cooked to medium rare and everything. When it comes to portion, at first I thought it was a bit small. However I realized that it was at a pretty good portion to keep you happy and satisfied without feeling bloated. A side of fries could also fit right in.   Service was awesome. They check up more often than not and they're super friendly and sociable. As for the wait time, it took about 20 minutes. Not ideal but it's fine.  Would come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. The fries is ok and there is long wait for food but overall they know what their doing and its not a simple burger."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burgers we've had in a long long time! We tried the hell's kitchen burger and it was simply magnificient, so good we came back the day after and had another ! The flavours all came perfectly together with the roasted tomatoes and delicious aioli making the burger! At some point there was meat that came out of the sandwich and just having the meat plain was also delightful, cooked perfectly ! We also had the Crown burger and both of them were so good you can't have them with anything else, i.e fries. You will want to bite in and take your time to allow all the flavours to be enjoyed. I didn't want my burger to end!  Service was also fantastic !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I got the  Backyard Burger (impossible /vegan). Really tasty. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Here is my review Chef Ramsay.... I did go to you LV site to have a burger and maybe if I would have followed my own advice I may have had a pleasant experience however I ordered the lobster shrimp burger... Hugh mistake on my part. Lobster and Shrimp are so delicate you have to beware of over seasoning them this location or this chef was not... I wasn't sure if I was eating seafood or sausage the consistency and flavor were that bad, it was unrecognizable, If it was truly Lobster and Shrimp it was over cooked to rubber consistency .... I was very disappointed"}
{"text":"BELIEVE THE HYPE!  Amazing burgers, even though it was a little too salty, but management made it right. Just be aware, it takes about 30 mins for the best burger, but just order a cocktail n be happy,,,,you're in Vegas!  Find a VIP, so you don't have to wait in line,,,,like I did lol.   Also amazing service (that always wins my heart)."}
{"text":"As far as Vegas food sites, there are more than someone could cover in a lifetime. This is my second visit in 5 years, and I will continue to come back.  Decor: They just finished up a rebuild, and it looks stunning. The same fireplace entrance is there to give people wanting selfies more than they could ask for. Comfortable seating and bar area.   Service: It's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, of course it was good. Just be nice and respectful to the servers and they will do the  same to you. I was a little off put when the hostess told me my party could be moved up if I gave her what everyone in Vegas wants...money.    Food: The food has always been spot on. I had a burger with a specialty pork on it. It was super filling, I had to force the fries down too. I can't comment on the drinks, I don't drink alcohol anymore.   Overall: This is a really nice place, great for tourists. It's expensive like all the food there, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I use to love this place they recently changed there menu and took off my favorite the jalape√±o poppers and they don't have the farm burger any more. The farmhouse is similar to the farm burger but it's not that great. Every time I go to Vegas I always stop by here it was always one of my fav to go spots but after this memorial weekend trip they disappointed me so much. I love Gordon Ramsey's restaurants from his steak house at the Paris to the pub at the Cesars and to have this spot change so drastically on taste and menu is such a disappointment it really doesn't uphold the Gordon Ramsey name brand"}
{"text":"I ate the Hell's kitchen burger and paid extra $6 for the veg impossible burger. Honestly the burger was ok but overall the burger was lacking sauce /flavor. The onions rings were good but too oily. The fries were good but nothing like English chips. No I would t go back to eat here. Ambiance was cool!"}
{"text":"My husband ate here for the second time last night. Last year we loved every bite. This year was a different story. My husband got the hog burger and he said it was just ok. I got the portobello burger which has no meat but still cost $18. The mushrooms were horribly salty, also the menu said it had shaved veggies.....I can cut thinner veggies by hand at home. The waiter was nice enough to take my burger off the bill. He said they tasted the mushrooms in the back and in fact they were brined in a salt solution and that they were way too salty. All I could think of is what Gordon would have said, \"You served this to a customer?!\"  I will say the onion rings were light and crispy and not greasy....they were the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner at around 6, and the place was swamped. Service was slow, burgers took 30 minutes, but failry attentive. Sides are okay at best, but burgers Al la carte are worth the visit. I had the farm burger and it was skillfully seasoned and cooked perfectly; Bacon crispy and egg runny. Bun was soft and everything seemed well thought out flavor and texture wise. Everytime I have been here these thing have been true. And I returned yet again. Not a perfect experience, but a damn good burger. ( And great beer selection)"}
{"text":"I loved it, the burger was AMAZING, worth the wait to get in, and the price. It is not often I order meals as they were designed, some say I am a picky eater, but there are things I don't like.   I loved every bite."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger, but definitely expected more out of Ramsey. The burgers are okay. I even tried out their anniversary burger with aged Ribeye and New York strip. No amazing flavor or anything.   The truffle oil I got on the side though was amazing. Lol   My wife tried out the farmhouse burger, and she liked the juiciness of the burger as did I."}
{"text":"The wait is long but I suspect they do it on purpose so the food will be delicious which it was. Had the sweet potato fries, wings, and hell something burger. Yummy but this review is for a worker that my plus one and I couldn't take our eyes off of. Found out his name is Levi. Whoever management is needs to take note of this employee. His heart and enthusiasm was in his work!  If I were local I would try to poach him. :) Half kidding"}
{"text":"I ate here with my husband about 3 years ago and the food and service was amazing. Tonight the food and the service was horrible. Our whole party came from all over the country to meet (before a wedding) on our recommendation and the party of 11 was horribly disappointed all around. So unhappy and SO expensive for poor food. Dont EVER order the poutin fries.  Tasted like a cafeteria microwave meal with dog food on it.  Nasty"}
{"text":"Wait time was ridiculous. Not just the lineup to get into the restaurant. Once seated it took far too long to order and receive our meals. The fries were undercooked and the burger was a bit underwhelming. It's quite possible that I came on an off day when the food and service wasn't up to its usual standard. I would try it again if I didn't have to wait so damn long to eat"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Our Evening!!! Hubby's Birthday!! Thank you Sister Evy Eve for treating Pops? He loved dirge Farmhouse Burger!!! I loved the Ahi Sliders!!! Great service!!!! So delicious and comfortable setting!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the blue cheese burger and was so good and the Parmesan fries was to die for..."}
{"text":"Only good thing about this place was the service, and the truffle fries. We had the blue cheese burger. I love blue cheese, but it had way too much. Honestly all that was tasted was the blue cheese. Would not order again. And we also had the burger with duck bacon. Again, way too much of whatever cheese was on there. It was all you could taste and I had to remove the top bun to even enjoy. Also had the wings. They were okay, but came out really cold. Probably would never go back. 3 stars for the truffle fries."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant that we went to.  The burgers were excellent, I got the ultimate cheeseburger as I am not really into fancy goods.   The onion rings were pretty good but the truffle parmesan fries were amazing!  Tried to go again on our last day but we ran out of time and the wait was too long.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"The last time I was in Vegas, there was a HUGE line so we called in ahead of time for reservations. Unfortunately, this place doesn't take reservations.  Luckily, our party of 4 got there pretty early so we were able to get a table almost right away. Our hostess recommended the Hells Kitchen Burger, which I was planning on getting anyway because DUHHH! Gordon Ramsay! My bf got the Forest Burger for the mushrooms. We also ordered the garlic fries and poutine.   The Hells Kitchen Burger was AMAZING! Cooked to a perfect medium and full of flavor! My bf's Forest Burger was really good too, but I still prefer the Hells Kitchen Burger. The fries and poutine were also very good. The burgers were a good size. With the fries, we were too full to finish everything and took half the burgers and fries to go.   I would definitely return here for a casual lunch on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I really wanted to like this place, and like other reviews I hold Gordon to a high standard.  2pm on a Sunday, after being seated we waited 15 minutes to order, then 30 minutes for the burgers. I ordered mine rare, and like the other review mentioned, I think they only know one temperature, plus the patty is thin. Even after remaking it so it would be rare, it pretty much looked the same."}
{"text":"The burger was great; exactly what I would expect(especially for the price) the fries however were terrible! $8 for fries that were bland and uninspired."}
{"text":"Ok. I'm just gonna say it. Straight up. And I don't want you to think less of me.   I went to Gordon Ramsay Burger and I ordered a salad. Yes, the wheatberry quinoa salad. And here is comes:   It was the BEST SALAD I have ever had in my life.   I'm just gonna repeat myself because I know you're probably in disbelief. I went to Gordon Ramsay Burger and had the best salad of my entire life!   I don't know when I became THAT girl that ordered a salad at the burger joint. I usually judge people who does that shit. It's like going to a Chinese restaurant and ordering fried rice and orange chicken. No! That is not acceptable. (I'm Asian if you can't tell). But I did. I don't know if it's because I'm pregnant and trying to be remotely healthy for this unborn child or because I've been eating shit all week in Vegas, but something inside of me was screaming for the wheatberry salad.   I was actually very hesitant to order it because I saw everyone around me eating burgers. And damn! Those burgers looked and smelled so good. So I thought I'd make the healthier choice and go for the salad. I knew I was gonna regret it.   But to my surprise, it was the best decision I've made in life. It truly was. (Am I dramatic? Maybe! But food is life!) That salad was incredible! The chicken was so flavorful! Not greasy at all! The salad was full of crunch with all sorts of nuts, dried fruits, fresh veggies, and quinoa. It was epic and it was everything I wanted and more. I couldn't have dreamt of a better salad. I had asked for the dressing on the side, and I didn't even poured an ounce of dressing onto my salad! It didn't need it! It was that good!!   The best part of the salad? It was massive! It can probably feed 3 people. Or one pregnant girl! Ha! I ate the entire thing myself even though I was so full half way through it. But I was determined not to let that deliciousness go to waste! Trust me on this- order the wheatberry quinoa salad!! You won't regret it. Your body will thank you.   I had a bite of my friend's turkey burger and truffle fries. It was pretty darn good. I won't lie! Truffle fries are pretty greasy though. You can tell it came straight from the deep fryer and you can see the oil dripping down as you dive in for your first bite. If that's your type of thing, then go for me. For me, it was too greasy.   I will definitely come back here! It makes me sad that we don't have this joint in SF. The restaurant is great- very modern and clean. Servers are attention and friendly. Prices are reasonable for the strip. And overall, it's just delicious! I don't know and I don't care who Gordon Ramsay is but man, he sure knows how to make an unforgettable salad!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype and the burgers are amazing! A friend and I stopped by here on a Friday night around 5pm. Although there was already a line, it wasn't too long and we were quickly seated in about 10-15 minutes.  The atmosphere is casual but classy and the waiters and waitresses are wonderful. Since this is called the Gordon Ramsey Burger, we both got burgers and truffle/parmesan fries.  The forest burger is a beef patty topped with tremor cheese, seasonal forest mushrooms, and duck bacon. It was sinfully savory and the buns are crispy and buttery without being overly heavy. The patty was cooked to perfection (caramelized edges with a hint of pink on the inside) and the goat cheese gives an unexpected tang to tickle the taste buds in a delightful way. The mushroom lend the burger an overall mellow earthy tone. Lastly, the duck bacon complements the tangy cheese well with its saltiness. However, I would have preferred the bacon to be thicker since this slice was too thin to bring out the meaty and fattiness of duck meat.  The tomato sauce and truffles aioli sauce for the parmesan fries are really good! The tomato sauce tastes like Italian sweet gravy and the truffles aioli is creamy, earthy, and savory. However, I prefer my fries to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The fries I received were dry on the inside and out.  The service was very good, but the burger could have been hotter when it arrived. When we received the burger, it was lukewarm which means that it was sitting out for a while before being brought to our table.  Overall, good meal and very good service. Gordon Ramsey Burger did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"OK. thay take soooo long to serve.. they are nice but u have 2 wait over an hour to get serve!!!! so if u are really hungry don't come here"}
{"text":"The best place in Vegas for casual dinning! Corn beef sandwich is out of this world!Ask for truffle fries instead of kettle chips! A bit pricy but hey it's Vegas ! $80 for a sandwich a hamburger a beer and a Bloody Mary ! But with it! Enjoy."}
{"text":"Was so excited to finally get to try out a Chef Ramsey establishment that I didn't mind waiting an hour and a half to eat hamburgers.  Apparently when you have a party of 3 or more, you can leave them your number and they will text you when you're table is ready vs less then 3 you just wait in this long looking line.  Either way it's a long wait.  When we got the text, we waited another 6 min for them to clean the table and finally we got seated.  Yay!  Most of us ordered the Hells' Kitchen Burger because of our waiter's recommendation for first timers.  We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries and beer battered onion rings to share.  And Creme brulee shake and brown butter caramel pecan shake to wash down the greasy food.  The patty was melt in your mouth delicious!  I ordered medium rare and it came perfectly cooked.  My issue with the burger was that it was INCREDIBLY salty.  I recall a bite where it felt like I was eating salt straight up and could feel the crunchiness of the salt on my teeth.  Maybe the salt was spread on unevenly or extra was spread on after?  Had the same issue with the fries where it was just too salty.  The onion rings were ok but nothing to rave about.  I loved the oreo shake part to my creme brulee shake but it turns out to be overwhelming with creme brulee on top and on the bottom.  It was just too rich for me to finish and felt kind of sick sucking up creme brulee on the bottom.  I'd recommend just order the oreo shake without the creme brulee.  Everyone liked the pecan shake but I prefer something sweeter when it comes to shakes.  I think overall maybe I just had a really high expectation for this place and it really fell short for me: food and service.  I love Gordon Ramsay and I'm a huge fan of his show and it saddens me to write this review but   everything was just okay and no way in hellz am I gonna wait an hour and a half ever again for mediocracy."}
{"text":"Cannot go wrong here!! I stop by every time I come to town, as the food is amazing and service is top- notch. Never had anything that was less than stellar. I miss the jalape√±o poppers they used to offer, but there are plenty of other great apps, such as the ahi sliders or poutine fries. The burgers are large and always cooked perfectly. Each one combines unique flavors that are just perfect. I recommend going early, as the line gets long during main meal times."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place out, we waited for 30 minutes which wasn't bad I guess, I ordered the shrimp and lobster burger, my husband had the blue cheeseburger. For $26 I expected to be wowed but was disappointed. My husband wasn't impressed either, he said he liked super duper burgers way better. We should have eaten at Pink's"}
{"text":"Waited maybe like 20-25 min.   $12 for a side of fries ??   The spicy jalape√±o burger was delicious! Cooked to perfection! Definitely recommend.   Got the nachos and they surprised me because they were kettle chips. It had meat and a white cheese. Never had nachos like that but my friend really loved it. It wasn't that flavorful in my opinion   The service was A1. She was very knowledgeable and helpful."}
{"text":"Great burgers for a tourist but hang onto your wallet! Mucho denero!  If U are really craving a Unique burger this is your place for a date! Right up the street is Fatburger for half the price and just as good!"}
{"text":"Talking about this place makes me salivate. The burgers are incredible. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the patty was so juicy, I was extremely satisfied with this burger. Don't forget to get their sides. Beware though, the line can sometimes go around the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome lol the seats are comfortable and they don't let you finish a soda before you got a fresh one and the food is unbelievable will behave again and try the forest burger with duck bacon it's the greatest..."}
{"text":"La primera vez no pudimos entrar porque la l√≠nea era demasiada larga, la segunda vez si lo logramos las hamburguesas s√∫per deliciosas, podr√≠an compartirse entre 2 personas sino llevas mucha hambre. Imperdibles las papas con trufa y la ketchup es casera"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Waited in line for about 30-40 minutes to get in. Ordered the Parmesan truffle fries right away, they were great! Our waiter was very friendly. I had the portobello burger and my boyfriend had the Hell's Kitchen burger. Both were delicious! The only con was that the burgers took a long time to come out."}
{"text":"Where do I begin so I had the lobster and shrimp burger and that was probably the most delicious burger I've ever had in a long time definitely worth the price!! Got sweet potato fries barely finished them cuz they were so generous with the amount they give lol highly highly treccomend!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but not spectacular. We all got the farmhouse burger (which was decent, but not great) and shared the onion rings (which, when dipped in their ranch sauce, were super good! ) and the parmesan truffle fries (also pretty good) but for 100 bucks for 3 people seems a bit spendy when all we drank was water."}
{"text":"Oh what's the big fuss about..it's the guy we always see on TV -  Gordon. It's just a another burger joint. Lol. But after the first bite of my Crown Burger, I'm sold!  Very juicy and tender and full of flavor. Will definitely come back again, but beware there maybe a 30 min wait..just go relax and grab a drink by the nearby bars."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in Vegas.  Even the fries were top notch.  Be sure to ask for all the sauces.  They have a couple of different types of ketchup that all tasted great, but the start of the meal was their ranch that was mixed with some cheddar cheese.  So good and worked perfectly on every item we got."}
{"text":"My burger was amazing. The creme brulee shake to die for. There is a long wait if you don't get there before they open but it is totally worth it.  My only complaint is that we didnt get our order of fries until after we had already finished our burgers."}
{"text":"The lobster burger was bland and the just fries had no salt on them-I had to ask for a salt shaker! I asked the people next to us who had onion rings and they said they were delicious.   Won't be a next time"}
{"text":"This place was good but didn't quite live up to the hype, I was told the high end beef burger they had in this week was one of if not the best burger they ever had. I expected it to be more like a steak burger but it was ground up beef. The fries we got with our order were 100% undercooked, if they were going for potatoes wedges they should have called them that. Worth a lunch but maybe not as hyped as it should be."}
{"text":"Not sure what's changed since it was BURGR except the name, color of mats and menus, but still seems to be the same type of place?  This burger spot is a must go to for me and my friend and never disappoints. Service is always spot on, and food is filling and tasty.  My friend and I both ordered a yummy tequila cocktail which was quite strong for me! We also both ordered the Forest Burger and an order of just fries. They both came out pretty quickly, and the burger was amazing! The mushrooms in it was the perfect compliment. The fries are steak fries, which aren't my favorite, but they give you a chipotle and curry ketchup. I don't like ketchup, but the curry one is nice. I also asked for a truffle aioli which was yummmmmmmmmy! Perfect to add to the burger too.  For the price, this place can't get any better! A must try for some good food!"}
{"text":"I think 4 stars is about right. Way too long of a wait for these burgers. They were good, but too much hype for them. Definitely not worth the 90 mins wait time and then another 30 mins for them to cook it. I tried the hell kitchen burger and the truffle fries. Fries were amazing. Burger was decent."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at this restaurant and I have to say these were the BEST burgers we've ever had! My wife had the Blue cheese burger and I had the Farmhouse burger. Both were completely different but they both had the perfect combination of complex flavors. We also ordered the Poutine fries which were impeccable!  Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Gordon Ramsay, but I felt like there is a lot of hype surrounding the restaurant. Yes, I understand that he is a world-renowned chef and that he has put time into creating these fancy, unique burger recipes. However, I personally thought my burger was good, but nothing spectacular.  Seating took a while (as expected), which is okay. However, it took us almost 30-40 minutes to receive the food after ordering. I ordered the Hog Burger - mangalitsa pork, mangalitsa bacon, bbq pork, white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion & slaw. The ingredients were fancy and the burger was flavorful. However, the pork was a little too dry for my taste and wasn't really juicy at all. I'd want to order something else next time before deciding if I like/dislike this place.  On the other hand, the Burnt Ends Poutine was good - fries, burnt ends, black pepper gravy, cheddar cheese curds & pickled onions. Incredibly savory and the black pepper gravy was perfect. I enjoyed this much more than my burger.."}
{"text":"The service was horriblr. 1st they texted me for a table for 5 i checked in and then they forgot about my party and said we did not make it on time. When the hostess told us they were setting up the table. Then we ordered our food and they did noy bring our truffle fries or onion rings until we asked for them because we were almost done with our meal! Although they wete eventually comped it was horrible service and ruined a birthday lunch."}
{"text":"Bad service.  Slow service.  EVERYTHING was far over cooked - even the fires.  We had to wait 18 minutes to even send anything back.  Awful!  Try something else."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had. The patty was nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection. I ordered the Hog's Burger which surprised me how good it was because it was an all pork burger! Also the fries were very good with housemade ketchup. The milkshakes and tart were a perfect finish to the meal. The service was also very nice and all the staff were very attentive and friendly. A great restaurant in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Worth the hype, worth the wait.  THE juiciest burger I've ever had in my life.  The exact flavor you want and need when you're craving \"that\" kind of burger.  Every mouthful has you pausing to take in the texture, aroma and savory bliss of the bun, meat and all your other toppings.  My mouth is watering all over again.  LOVED IT.  Other stuff: the poutine fries were - eh - for me; the star wasn't the fry, it was the pepper....a bit too much, actually.  There were some cheese curds that the menu said were included, but were not visible and didn't add anything.   The drink recommended and mixed by the bartender was good; I might go with a cold beer next time; it would just fit better.    Ambiance is fun, kids can eat there - it's pretty loud, so even if they have spunk and volume like my daughter, it probably wouldn't be too off-putting.  Loved that they sold regular memorabilia (t-shirts, hats) but also had glassware, coasters, bottle openers and cookbooks.  Cool place - can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"On previous trips had always shied away because of the line but this time went for it because the line was 'only' about sixteen people long (not even counting their party members wandering the casino), it actually moved along faster than I would have thought, our party of three was seated in under twenty minutes.  The beer menu had extensive offerings, I was so happy they had a couple selections of Stone Brewing available and would actually enjoy coming here just to have drinks.  We started with the onion rings and truffle parmesan fries, both of which transitioned into excellent sides for the burgers.  The burgers themselves were absolutely awesome, we tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which I did not perceive as being spicy in the least, only very, very delicious!  Also had the Blue Cheeseburger, which I was skeptical about because while I like blue cheese I am not a fan of figs nor jam and I assumed \"figgy jam\" would be something unpleasant to me, but I was surprised how the flavors all worked so perfectly together to make a burger I felt embarrassed about doubting!  I highly, highly recommend not being scared away by lines at this place, I could have been enjoying these burgers so much sooner if I hadn't."}
{"text":"Cons: long line. Don't take reservations.   Pros: accepts credit cards. Easy to find location. kettle chip nachos. Had this great sauce that the kiddos loved. My husband and I shared Some sort of Pork burger w/bacon and pulled pork. Well balanced flavors. Savory and sweet."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger. They were able to make any burger on the menu into vegetarian (by using Portobello mushroom).   Hells burger was delicious. (Jalape√±os are spicy so I had them on the side). Parmesan truffle fries were BOMB and came with truffle mayo (which was okay..).   I appreciated that they split the bill between 6 of us when they brought it in. Made it very easy to pay with a large party."}
{"text":"Best Onion Rings I have ever had in my life! A perfect mixture if breaded ingredients. While visiting Vegas, we were looking for a good burger joint near Planet Hollywood. This place definitely fit the bill. My burger was great as expected. The wait was a bit long and a lunch for two cost us around 60 bucks with a tip. Another thing worth mentioning, they offer a military discount. I think it was 10 percent off."}
{"text":"Burgers burger burgers      With burgers being one of may favorite foods.      Gordon Ramsey burger located inside planet Hollywood was my favorite burger that I had while visiting Vegas. The burgers were cooked to perfection and the service was great. We sat at the bar because if you want a great experience at any restaurant sitting at the bar has always been great for us. They had a few bartenders which was great to see because everyone was taken care of even with the huge dinner crowd that came in while we were there.       At 18 dollars a burger it better be good right? Well it was and we weren't disappointed with our choices. I of course picked the spicy jalape√±o burger and dh ordered the breakfast style burger. Can't remember the actual names of the burgers but they were delicious. So many fancy names on the menu I though using a description of what was on it would work. We had the chips with pulled pork and those were amazing for an appetizer not to big just the right amount before our burgers came out. No fries with burger but the guy next to us ordered the Parmesan truffle fries and offered us a few because they give you a lot and he was by himself and told us we could have some of his. Those were by far the best French fries I have ever had.       The bar area has about 12 seats across the bar and tables out side of that which has a view of the casino.     I will definitely return to this location on the next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Never fails. It's my second time here in Gordon Ramsay Burger and every order always tastes good. The first time I was here, we ordered the ahi sliders and the foie burger. The best we've ever tasted! I'm not a burger eater but I ate the whole burger. The second time we ordered Hell's kitchen burger and the lobster and shrimp burger and they both taste so good! A must when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Juicy, flavorful burgers. Delicious appetizers (hummus recommended). Great atmosphere, nice people. Decent service. Lots of menu options. This place is overall great and I totally suggest coming here."}
{"text":"Waited for two hours to get my chicken curry burger. Had my salad. A guy comes in a half hour after me and gets all his food. I ask the server where my chicken sandwich is and they say sorry. Ten minutes more I wait for my chicken burger. They only comp the chicken burger. Not my whole meal. I was here over two hours. WTF!!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't know a burger could be so good. It was a great experience"}
{"text":"If you're a diamond member for total rewards you can skip the long lines. The onion rings were incredible and the burgers were cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! I had the portobello mushroom burger, and my husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger in median rare meat. We both loved it. The portobello mushroom burger amazed me again and again, the burger was with lots of layers that I've never thought of a burger can be. The truffle fried was also a great choice, it came with two sauce, one is truffle mustard (maybe, not sure), the other red sauce is made of fresh tomato and some other ingredients that we couldn't figure out. But both sauces and fries itself were delicious!"}
{"text":"Was walking around Vegas looking for somewhere to eat and when we saw this the burgers called our name, I had gone here before and it was good!!!.  We were quickly serviced and seated. Then we ordered, and to our surprise the burgers came out 3 maybe 5 min after ordering.  At first, since we were starving, we were happy to just have food in front of us, however that feeling was short lived.  We quickly realized the burgers got there so fast that they must have been sitting there already cooked for god knows how long.  But again since we were starving, we continued to eat.  And let me tell you what a mistake that was, I've been having stomach pain since and wasted a lot of time last night and this morning in the room rather than enjoying my trip.  Very disappointed.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Grab an Uber and go to In n Out... Go anywhere but here. Most disappointing were the fries. The sweet potato fries were soggy and barely edible, so we ordered the regular ones (for $9) hoping for nice, thick cut fries and classic ketchup. Gordon - WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE KETCHUP?! Heinz 57 is beautiful and perfect the way it is... Yours is a disaster. This meal wouldn't even be passable if I were wasted."}
{"text":"You will never find a better burger. Simply magnificent. But be aware that the wait line can be long even in the middle of the afternoon. If you are alone and the line is long, inquire as to whether they can seat you at the bar."}
{"text":"OK so let me start by saying I stayed at planet Hollywood Hotel and I decided to eat here with my mom. Especially by the amount of people that were waiting in line to get in.  So I assumed it would be amazing. We each got a burger and we told the hostess to put it to go  because There was a long wait for a table . But what I didn't know is that our food literally took  like 40 minutes or more. Once we got it we saw that it didn't come with fries or chips or anything. Just a big box for a plain tiny burger. That doesn't have a taste to it and the worst part is that it was raw in the centerof the meat. I was so disappointed especially for the price that you pay for it. I guess i was just paying for his name."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was phenomenal.  Guy was a great \"front man\" recommending delicious drinks and burger choices. Kurtis and Rick brought the performance with their renditions on Happy Birthday to my friend Katy. Guy was clearly envious of the manager's jaw line and lush beard but he was able to work through that for the sake of good service. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Dining at Gordon Ramsay burger is a great experience if you are a fan of Gordon Ramsay. If you are all about the burger experience, you may want to approach with caution.   I didn't have a bad dining experience at GRB. The service was exceptional and the food was good. The problem for me was the prices. At the end of the day, it is burger and fries, yet I felt like I paid such a high price for what I was getting. Two burgers, one order of fries and three beers was over $90 after tip, which seems extreme to me. I get that you pay a premium on the strip, but this seemed out of hand. There are other places on the strip that have better burgers and for a lesser price.   Again, if you a Gordon fan, then definitely hit this place up. If you are just looking for a burger, you may want to pass."}
{"text":"The burger was good, but nothing to write home about. Gourmet burger places are pretty popular now and I don't think this one offered anything outstanding compared to others. Parmesan truffle fries were very good, but we waited 40 minutes (after the fries arrived) for our burgers. They told us shift change was happening - at 7pm on Friday!? Not a good idea. Also, best to come here if you have a group of 4 or less."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant!   Food: This place should be five stars! I had the Crown Burger, truffle fries and Baby Black Kale Apple Caesar Salad. The burger was cooked to a medium. The flavor was all there and everything inside the burger was A+. Truffle fries were bomb! The ketchup was amazing, I don't know how to describe it but I couldn't get enough. My brother who doesn't like ketchup actually wanted to finish the sauce. The Dijon mustard was suburb! Lastly the salad was light and filling. It was a great way to start the meal.   Service: Our waiter was hilarious! He informed us of all the specials and joked around with how we reacted to the food. He could see that we thought the food was delicious. I don't think there was a point where he did not check up on us. Keep up the great work staff!   Ambiance: I love the British theme. All the posters and color design are pleasing. The dragon with the fire up front was great to look at. The tables and seats were comfortable. I like how you can look into the kitchen and see the chefs cooking.   Overall a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Black Forest burger with arugula, duck ham, tremor cheese was delicious. Mushroom poutine was very porcini, I really liked it. We enjoyed our meal. Very popular place that's why we stayed in line for 40min to get seated. It doesn't worth going there again."}
{"text":"Great experience at GR Burger- we ordered a lobster and shrimp burger and the hell's kitchen burger - so tasty! Bun was light,  roasted jalapenos and the meat with the asadero cheese and avocado= perfection Oh and the sweet potato fries with the buttery jelly like sauce- yummy!"}
{"text":"Talk about a phenomenal burger! Everything this place has is worth trying out. Milkshakes are amazing and the jalape√±o poppers are a must try if you like jalape√±o poppers at any other restaurant. One of the best restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"My second experience for GR burger actually ended up being a subpar experience.  As where I am paying 4 times higher price per burger, I expected an equivalent service. However, our service was nothing but a disappointment. The server forgot our drinks. Once she brought them she spilled them all over the table and me. Broke a glass on us. Our food was served super late. No one came to really apologize us about the whole awful experience.  The food was alright. The beef was not even juicy to think that i got a steak in between my buns.   Would I come back? Not really unless a friend visiting wants to try it"}
{"text":"The burger was awesome. I got the classic burger, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions. We ordered french fries and onion rings. The onion rings were out of this world and it came with two different sauces, both delicious. French fries, I woudn't go crazy about them, a bit mushy. Just that we got seated next to the burning flames which I guess is part of the decor at the end of March, and the waiters were not willing to seat us somewhere else and would want us to go out and wait in the line again if we wanted a different seat. I am not sure what's Gordon's plan for those flames in the summer, it was only March and we were burning already. Maybe that would make people order more beers."}
{"text":"I found it mediocre at best. The burger was cold, bacon not crispy, fries truffle felt not fresh.  I felt dizzy as I left an hour ago, finally got to my room and got so sick I could barely stand to vomit.  I am not a drinker, so though in Vegas, I must be the only sober person around.  Those who rate above a star are comparing to McDonald.  Very very very upset."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked it we knew it would be fantastic! When you have a hostess like Evelyn who greets you in such a warm and friendly manner it sets the tone for an incredible dining experience. IMO Evelyn should be put on the fast track to management training. She certainly has the people skills.  And of course the food and dining service is as always marvelous."}
{"text":"The fries and the oreo cookie creme brulee shake came out somewhat quickly and were delicious. The burger was a tasty and appetizing, but seeing as though we got here and ordered a little after 11 and it just barely got served at 12:20, even thought we were told the burgers take 20-25 minutess, not sure it's worth it...especially when you're really hungry."}
{"text":"Everything was uniquely delicious and put together. I had the Lobster and shrimp burger with a spicy margarita. My hubby had the \"Hog Burger\" and we shared the Parmesan onion rings which were fried to perfection. I'm picky about shrimp and was so happy that it was not a lot of filling in my lobster and shrimp patty."}
{"text":"There was a huge line when I came across GRB one night in Vegas. I was alone, so went to the hostess and asked if there was bar seating available -- which there was, at the Kitchen Bar! I immensely enjoyed watching the kitchen staff execute at a pace and with a focus you would expect from a GR kitchen. I had the special burger. Of course it was great. I ate half, and had the other half for breakfast the next morning. Dare I say it was better cold from the fridge the next morning? 4 stars because of price... I had a burger, fries, 2 beers, and I spent $50+. Not a surprise given you are in Vegas, but... the value makes it a one-time visit.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty simple to sum this one up: 1.  Easy and efficient check-in 2.  Table was ready when the text came 3.  Super nice server and very attentive. Even during shift change 4.  Burger was outstanding and we knew it would take about 25 min. It did take a little longer but they were crazy busy. 5.  Would have liked a few more options on the burgers but this is his menu. Settled for the UK burger and was a great decision. 6.  Onion rings came out quickly and were outstanding. Very light batter that held up to frying and the two sauces provided. Sauces were nice mix between sweet and spicy. 7.  Despite delay, burger was cooked perfectly. Love the toasted bun with sesame (light and dark). Fries were solid. Not greasy. Nicely salted -- and I like a lot. 8.  Server was very attentive with refills, as we were just doing tea and soft drinks that afternoon. 9.  Everyone cleaned their plates and we got out in a timely manner to head back to casinos/shopping/people watching. 10.  Exactly what you would expect from Ramsey. Perfection expected and delivered.  He might have dropped a few F-bombs on the timeliness but the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"GIven all the hype, it was just okay."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and said the burger was awesome. Ok, let's give it a try.  I came here after J Lo's concert at the same hotel. It was around 11pm but the place was crowded!  However, a table for 2 usually doesn't take too long.  We started off with a portion of their fries. Delicious!!! Thick slices just like I love. They came with some dipping sauces and one of them was truffle aioli, which was so good! I ordered the Forest burger. I had never had duck bacon before and loved it! This burger was very very good. The bun was toasted so didn't get soggy throughout the meal.  The other guest had the Blue burger. I tried a piece of it and it was good too. For cheese lovers it is a must! It is VERY cheesy.  We decided we needed more fries so we ordered the sweet potato fries. They are served in very thin slices with some powdered sugar on top. I really liked them, it is a different twist. But their \"simple\" fries were my favorite!"}
{"text":"Based on all the reviews I thought the food was going to be something special. Definitely nothing really good. I ordered the tandoori chicken burger and it was on the dry side. Not much flavor. Not worth $14.   We also ordered the shrimp salad. Shrimp was extremely salty! Order it and try it for yourselves! It has good flavor, but the saltiest thing I've ever in my life tasted. The rest of the salad was a basic green leaf salad. Worth $16? NO.  Parmesan truffle fries. It was OKAY. Nothing special other than sprinkled cheese and garlic on fat soggy fries. Worth $12? NO.  Lastly service was extremely slow and lackluster.  Friendly employees at least."}
{"text":"Trying For The First Time,And We Loved It! Big Big Fans! The Hog Burger Is Honestly Really Delicious. It's The Best Burger I've Eaten,That's For Sure!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because it was right next door to our hotel and it's got Gordon Ramsey's name on it, so it's gotta be good, right?    Aside from the twenty minute wait in line (no reservations) next to fiery welcome sign (even behind multiple lanes of glass, I could still feel the heat), the food was great!   I ordered the Turducken burger with a side order of truffle Parmesan fries.  FYI, none of the burgers come with sides but the fries are worth the $12.  We started with the Poutine and scarfed that down in minutes - it was absolutely amazing!    Definitely come with your stomachs empty because the food is awesome and the portions are huge!  I thought I'd have room for a Creme Br√ªl√©e Shake after but, clearly, my eyes were much bigger than my stomach."}
{"text":"This place has a huge waiting line, any time of the day! :) For a large party of 6 people, there is a 2.5hour wait time, so plan accordingly. Once we got our table the service was quick.  Oreo Creme Brulee milk shake is a not to miss dessert here! Bluecheese burger is a must try. I also liked Hell's kitchen burger and onion rings. Chicken wings were decent. Not a fan of fries here though."}
{"text":"Loved our burgers and experience at this place! Our server was very knowledgeable and accommodating with our orders. I had the Blue. So good! The onion rings are perfectly done with a balanced amount of batter to onion."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas and on the strip and you're in the mood for a good burger, definitely visit Planet Hollywood! There's always a line but it moves quickly. I think I waited for about 15 minutes.  The Blue Cheeseburger which has blue cheese, fig jam, arugula, cider vinegar reduction and spicy mayo is a must! Pair it with some truffle fries. It's a pretty big order to share!"}
{"text":"You cannot make reservations and have to stand in line, but the line moves along pretty well and you can look at the menu too while in line to help you decide what to get.  Service was great!  They were very nice.   1) Tandoori chicken burger - it was a bit dry and the feta is dry too so the tahini sauce could not save it. It was OK.  I would get something else. 2) Lobster-shrimp burger - SOOOO GOOD!  I would definitely get this again.  The pickled vegetables are spicy and tangy and really makes the burger 3) Parmesan fries- they are shaped like chips or wedges rather than thin fries just so you know. Make sure to ask for all their ketchups - chipotle ketchup, curry ketchup and regular as they are all tasty.  The truffle mayo it comes with too is tasty!  Overall great place and our server was really nice. Its a tasty reliable place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was great, even though we had to wait for 2 hours, but they gave us estimated time so we could come back after a little bit of street sightseeing. We ordered The hell's kitchen, Foie Burger, Blue cheese burger, The hog burger, and truffle parmesan fries. Hells kitchen and foie were really good. And I loved truffle parmesan fries!"}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers for such a great price! One of the best tasting burgers I've ever had. The restaurant itself was quite busy. The food was decently priced, the drinks seemed over priced for their taste. Our waiter wasn't very attentive and spent most of his time chitchatting with people. We ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and Crown burger. My husband liked it so much he ordered a second one, but it came out very undercooked. Overall, the food was great and this will definitely be a regular stop anytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"A little over priced because of the name but it is great flavor and hell we are in Vegas! So go there and expect a large bill but all worth it"}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place and decided to try it out. I got the \"Hell's Kitchen\" burger and it's dressed with avocados, cheese, roasted jalape√±o, roasted tomatoes, and jalape√±o a√Øoli. Wow. Best burger I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"A 3.5 would probably be a more accurate rating for this place. We were in town for a bachelor party and decided a good burger would hit the spot for lunch.   I am not sure how it worked out but since we had a fairly large party, we didn't have to wait in line. They took down our info and called us when the table was ready. I guess they didn't want is backing up the line too long. This was great as we were able to wander around a little bit and grab some drinks in the casino.   Once seated, our server got our drinks and an appetizer order. She was very pleasant and explained the different burgers in detail for whatever questions we had.   The burger was good, but not great. Cooked to perfection but flavor was lacking a little bit. Let me tell you what you need to order are the truffle fries...AMAZING! I believe it came with a couple of different dipping sauces which was a plus."}
{"text":"Muy rica la comida, aunque cara (es lo que tiene ser famoso en Las Vegas). No se hasta que punto merece la pena ya que hay mejores hamburguesas por la zona"}
{"text":"Been here too many times and the Hell's Kitchen burger never disappoint! A must try because I feel like there's a lot going on in the burger as compared to his other burgers. My favorite part about the burger is the tomato, definitely not like any other tomatoes you've had! This place is generally a good 30 mins-1 hr wait average , but might be less if you go during an off hour."}
{"text":"Everyone I come to Vegas, I have to stop here. The burgers are beyond amazing.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  My favorite it Bell's Kitchen Burger with a fried egg."}
{"text":"At first I was hesitant to come here. I've read reviews about how theres always a line.. & i hate lines.. I kept thinking to myself how good can their burgers be? No way they can be better than In-n-out's...  Anyways so one day i was strollin down the strip, it was around dinner time, stomach is getting a bit growly.. figured its time to find a bite to eat.. decided to stop by Planet Hollywood and chilll there for a bit.. enjoying that free AC while searching on Yelp for my next meal.. had this place bookmarked for the longest time so figured.. hey, im here, why the heck not!  i absolutely love the exterior of the restaurant, the highlight of it being the \"fire wall\".. just a really neat piece and great for photo ops.  The food here was amazing! its not comparable to In-n-out, being that these are gourmet burgers.. but they are definitely worth the price you will be paying for these bad boys.. you really cant go wrong with any of them.. but their most popular one is definitely their Truffle Burger which was DELICIOUS!!!  INSIDER TIP!!! ORDER THAT MILK SHAKE TO WASH IT ALL DOWN!!  No lie, my favorite item i got here was their milkshake, their custard, creme brulee with oreo to be exact. it will cost you around $11 but it was one of the most satisfying shake i have ever put  in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Referred to me from one of my colleagues. i have visited twice now. two things to say Wow & wow. The beef. my gosh so fresh and so well seasoned. The brioche bun, the combinations of toppings. I will be back again for sure. A must whenever you're on the Vegas strip"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and wonderful service. Tammy took great care of us. We should definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Party of 8 in town for Bachlorette party. The wait is long if you go for dinner. They do not take reservations. Ala Carte ordering. I spent about $25 for burger and onion rings I think. Service could have been better, our waiter was getting off and his replacement took forever to start or come to us. Food took awhile, they were short in the kitchen. Still giving a 4 Star because baby that food is GOOOOOD! Would definitely return"}
{"text":"This place is OVERRATED.  Been here twice, I told my friends this place is overrated the second time I came but they insisted on coming.  I got the Backyard Burger, and to be honest this is just a burger like any other burgers. I would say a burger from Jack in the box taste as good as any burgers from this place."}
{"text":"There's constantly a line outside of this place and it usually takes 25 minutes after you order to get your meal but it's well worth the wait. Easily the best tasting burger I've ever had. The Hell's Kitchen burger isn't as spicy as I was expect but the food was great. Sweet potato fries are sprinkled with powdered sugar and I can't get enough! Drinks are pretty pricey."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMMM!! The service was beyond great, the food was amazzzzzzing! Im not a fan of sweet potatoes, but the sweet potato fries with powdered sugar is really good! This place is a must go when in vegas. It's kid friendly if you're with kids, which is a huge plus. The decor and atmosphere are also great. We'll definitely be back on our next trip to vegas."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and waited for our burgers to be delivered for over an Hour. Sorry. It don't seat us hear after being 5 couples front the front of the line. 45 minutes later we were told  that it takes 35 minutes."}
{"text":"This place brought me to burger heaven. I would die a million times if it meant I got to visit burger heaven if not just for an hour. I wouldn't recommend this place for a date, cus you'll completely forget about your significant other and fall completely in love with the sweet sweet burg. I'm drooling just thinking about it and my girlfriend is wondering what's wrong with me. Little does she know I'm fantasizing about putting those delicious buns in my mouth."}
{"text":"Yummm yummmm and yummmmmm!!!!! 1 of the best burgers I have ever had!! A super cute little restaurant, right upon entering Planet Hollywood. I am sure there will always be a wait to eat here because of how amazing the burgers are. This was my first time and we waited about 20 minutes to get seated which wasn't too bad. We sat at the bar and the bartender was super attentive and friendly. Greeted us immediately with drinks and gave his recommendations and what the best items on the menu are. We went with what he recommended which was the famous Hell's Kitchen Burger. It took a while for the burger to come out, which he warned us about, so we also ordered the truffle fries to snack on while we waited. The fries were okay, but I may be bias because I am a thin cut fry person and their fries are thick wedge fries. They were good, but would have been AMAZING if they were thin cut. All that matters is the main course, which was out of this world!! It was on the spicy side, but my goodness! The bun was absolutely perfect and the burger literally melts in your mouth. MUST GO TO BURGER JOINT BEFORE LEAVING VEGAS!! YUM!! Pricing wasn't too bad either, well worth it! I wish I had room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Absolute genius. He knows how to make a burger. The flavor combination is perfect. My blue burger was salty & sweet. Meat cook was on point. We sat at the bar wait time for a table can be timely especially if you have 3 or more in your party. The atmosphere is very upbeat and inviting. Prices are reasonable.  If you want a burger come here. You won't be disappointed. ."}
{"text":"Hmmm .. I recommend that girls shared their burger and order fires or onion ring.. I can't eat the whole burger after eating onion rings and salad.  Burgers are okay."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burgers I've had anywhere. Go for the Hells Kitchen burger you can't miss. Fries are delish too. Weekend evenings can get busy, go for lunch to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"300th review!  UPDATE: I love how they \"renovated\" so they could start over on Yelp. {/end sarcasm mode}  TL;DR: Go to Bobby's Burger Palace if you feel you must eat a celebrichef burger while in Vegas. Half the price, better burgers, better service, little to no wait, no tipped employees.  Don't believe everything you see on TV! I'm so disillusioned. Gordon, you were my favorite celebri-chef. I forsook Anthony Bourdain for you! I have been following Gordon religiously and watching every show of his I could get my hands on ever since I discovered F Word and the original Kitchen Nightmares on BBC America 12 years ago. My husband and I have been quoting him for over a decade. I have even made Amy's Baking Co references in a Yelp review. But the food here was NOT \"simple, fresh, and vibrant,\" as Gordon could often be heard barking at hapless failing restaurateurs.  The fries were hard and over-seasoned. The burgers, which we ordered blue rare, came out well done. Sending it back did not fix it (and I fear the saliva added by our disgruntled waiter did not improve the flavor either). They also tasted burnt and oversalted, and both burger and bun were dry and crumbly - the former because it was overcooked, the latter because it was old (tasted even older than the bread we used to throw away for being too stale at the bakery I worked at while putting myself through college). The shakes were too sweet to choke down more than a mouthful or two and had way too much crap going on. Not just the shakes, EVERYTHING down to the sauces was needlessly complicated: some additional flourish for the \"coolness factor\" or something, not actually contributing anything to the flavor, and often going one step beyond to actually detracting. The food was as gimmicky and smug about its cleverness as the name BURG(ordon)R(amsay). No hint of simplicity, freshness, or vibrance. Just over-complication, massive overcooking, and smugness.  We left 3/4 of our food untouched, which is like a 9th circle-level sin for us. The servers just cleared our plates without caring to ask if there was a reason we didn't eat very much of it.  So not worth the hype, the price, or the long wait.  If I were Gordon I would want to make sure that every restaurant that bore my name and likeness had service and food I was proud to put my name on, but I guess he would rather watch his bank account grow than work to protect the reputation he sweated blood for years to attain.  The only reason why I can't say this was the worst overpriced meal I've ever had is because BEAST exists."}
{"text":"The hype is real!  I know that Chef Ramsay was not behind the grill the night we came, but it seems there is a real attention to detail here that has earned the name.    This was our Thanksgiving dinner this year.  My older son and I came here because the younger son was acting up.  This was my son's choice.  I was game.  There was a bit of a wait for two, but not too bad considering it's Vegas, at early dinner time, on Thanksgiving Day.  When we were seated the server came over pretty quickly.  They have a pretty simple menu of burgers and sides, but all of the offerings looked very interesting.    They have a good selection of draught beers on tap.  I started with a Boddington's - delish.    For an appetizer, we ordered their take on nachos - kettle cooked potato chips topped with corned beef and smothered in a cheese sauce.  OMG!  Wow!  This was sooo good.  My son ordered the basic burger and I ordered the Hog Sandwich for our entrees.  My son really liked his burger.  He plowed through it like nothing.  My sando was pretty amazing.  It had a ground pork patty topped with pulled pork, bacon, and onion strings.  Whoa!  Porky heaven.  The only hiccough of the meal was that they ran out of two beers that I tried to order.  I ordered the first off the menu.  The server came back and told me that they were out, but he also brought two tasters.  I really liked one, so I ordered it.  He came back a few minutes later and told me they were out of that one too, but he gave me a free glass of his other recommendation.  I did not expect that at a big name Vegas restaurant, so all worked out fine.  Definitely a great place for a casual meal in Vegas.  Based on this experience, I want to try some other GR restaurants."}
{"text":"Recently tried this delicious burger place while out in Vegas. An absolute must stop if you are a fan of Gordon Ramsay and his delicious food. The line can be quite a wait but if you have a party of 4 or more can go by a bit quicker with preference for larger parties  Onto the food. I had one of the best burgers I've ever tasted in my life. Great quality meat and condiments. The ambience is amazing along with the friendly staff. Will def be checking this place out while in Vegas in the near future"}
{"text":"We were pretty impressed with our first visit so we decided to visit again this trip. The wait wasn't too long at 7-8pm on a Thursday night - about a half hour for a party of 2.   Since we weren't too hungry we decided to share the blue burger, chips with curry sauce, and a brown butter caramel pecan shake. Our server came by pretty quickly to ask us if we wanted to order any drinks (they're all listed on an ipad) but we declined seeing as how we already packed in quite a few drinks by that time. From there the service went a bit downhill, our server wasn't very friendly and also got our order wrong (order wasn't written down, just remembered). We ended up with the correct burger and drink but truffle parmesan fries instead - we decided not to send this back since it looked pretty good and the price difference is pretty small anyway. One thing to note, the food took a very long time to come out; we finished pretty much the entire shake before the fries came out.   As for taste, the blue burger is a solid if you like blue cheese, relatively simple but done well. I will say that I enjoyed my forest burger from our last visit a bit more. We loved the fries though, especially the truffle sauce which was extremely decadent. The shake was superb and I like how there were caramel pecans right on top - would definitely recommend trying out their shakes!!   We essentially didn't see our server for the rest of our meal and had to wait quite a while to get the check.   With everything said, I still like Burger- the food is great & well priced, plus the poor service seemed to be a relatively isolated incident. The tables in other sections near us seemed to have pretty attentive servers & our server from our last visit was also extremely friendly and attentive. Overall I'd still recommend stopping by if you're staying at Planet Hollywood or just craving a burger!"}
{"text":"It seems this place is always busy. We came here at 8 pm one night and were told that it would be a two hour wait. So, we decided to come back another night. When we arrived, we came here in a group of four at 9 pm and waited about an hour and a half for a table. By the time we were at the front of the line, we were super hungry - but we were told that a party of four would take 45 minutes longer, so we ended up splitting our party into pairs.   We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Kettle Chip Nachos. The burger was really good! The beef patty was tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. However, I was extremely disappointed with the nachos as the chips were basically drenched in oil. The chips were soggy from all the oil in this dish. One of my relatives felt sick to her stomach after eating this dish, and she was sick for the next few days of our trip.   Overall, I would not line up again and wait to eat those nachos. If I come back to Vegas, I'll be heading over to Ramsay's Fish and Chips instead!"}
{"text":"Meh. Ordered burgers and fries and shakes. Waited forever. Food was fine but nothing special. Even for the strip it seemed incredibly overpriced. After the long delay, they got two of the orders wrong, even though nobody ordered anything special. By the time they brought the re-do orders, everyone else had cold food. One of the re-do orders was still wrong. All of this took more than two hours and nothing was above average. Except perhaps the shakes. Those were tasty. The waiter never apologized which seemed tacky and just kept saying it was too loud to hear anything."}
{"text":"First the burger WAS GREAT! Can't argue that. But after all it is a $15 burger, it had better be, lol. The reason for the 3 star rating was the way they pile up extra charges without letting you know.  After my kids ordered their plain ole hamburgers the witness asked if they wanted mushroom or bacon. They, being kids said, \"ok\".......They don't tell you that that added $16 to the bill by doing that. Actually they way she mentioned it I too assumed it was part of the meal, she never said that it was extra, but then again I live in Vegas and know how they underhandedly gouge visitors. Shameful. Gordon, you don't need the money that bad."}
{"text":"The place feels a little more elevated and fancy. The fire by the doors gives it a true Gordon Ramsay feel. I waited in line and it moved rather quickly as long as you are in a party of two. They have to move tables to sit more than two people which is understandable. I got the crown burger which just melted in my mouth. My friend got the Hell burger. The server was great and took the initiative to have both burgers cut in half for us to share. Both were amazing in their own way. If you love burgers, check this place out. It's unbelievable. Highly recommend and plan to return."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and the service is great. The food though, isn't super surprising.  My husband and I ordered the onion rings, truffle fries, burger and ale dog.  The truffle fries were the best. The ale dog was SO salty I ended up having a bit and asking them to just take it off our bill.  Overall though, lots of food for the cost!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and it was such a good burger! The fries came with two types of specialty ketchup (Chipotle ketchup and Curry ketchup). Both had some kick to them and were great. I had the St. Archer IPA which was also fantastic. Do yourself a favour and go there for dinner if your in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Sub-par service.   +Crown Burger: My boyfriend ordered this and it was delicious, something about the dried tomatoes complimented the burger very well. +Blue Cheeseburger: I got this because I love blue cheese. I asked for the spicy mayo on the side because I didn't want it to be too saucy or spicy. This burger was not as good as the crown burger because it tasted so buttery and heavy. It was cooked perfectly and once I removed some of the cheese, the buttery-ness subsided, which was good.  +Onion Rings: Best onion rings ever! So glad we got these instead of the truffle fries. The breading was perfectly seasoned and crispy and the ranch and chipotle ketchup were amazing.   -The server disappeared after we got our food and we weren't able to flag her down to get the check for around 20-30 minutes. She tended to the tables around us but never came back for us. The bussers were extremely helpful though.  I would definitely come back but not if I'm in a rush to be anywhere."}
{"text":"Long line, long wait for the food, bad service, not tasty burgers. Overpriced. Didn't like it! Don't recommend!"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas ist der Appetit bekanntlich sehr gro√ü. Ich als gro√üer Freund von Rindfleisch zwischen zwei Br√∂tchenh√§lften musste dieses Lokal einfach aufsuchen. Bitte esst hier ! Alle Burger sind gro√üartig und mit viel Liebe zubereitet. Preis - Leistung ist ABSOLUT gerechtfertigt. Ich habe hier den besten Burger meines Lebens gegessen."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant as I was exploring Planet Hollywood, and of course me being a big burger snob, so I decided to check this place out. I found the exterior super exciting and cool looking. The wait was max 10 minutes.   Once we walked in and were seated, I was quite impress on how fast that was, however when I saw how big the restaurant was, my expectations of the quality of the food decreased. Thank goodness the ending was not a disappointment.  Being a huge burger snob of course I asked the extremely kind gentleman that assisted us for his recommendations. He gladly recommended a seasonal burger that was off menu. He provided the details of the ingredients and I was convinced so I ordered it ( forgot the name but it was beef with short rib, it was amazing!!!). I also ordered the fries that came along with a curry & chipotle ketchup. Me not being a fan of curry, chipotle nor ketchup, the thought didn't fancy my interest so in addition to what was already in front of me I still went ahead requested for regular ketchup. I ended up wanting to get the full experience of their touch to the fries so I went ahead and tasted both the curry and chipotle ketchup resulted in making my taste buds tingle and I ended up not being able to stop dipping my fries in the curry... wowsers..  Let's cut this long story to a conclusion...  The burger exceeded my expectations.. Yes, it did!! Would I try this place again.. Yes, I would definitely come again next time I'm in Vegas!!  Excellent Service and even though we were warned that we would wait a little while for our food, the wait was not as bad as we thought.   From a Beer Snobs point of view, the only downfall was that they don't have quite a large variety in Craft Beer and they don't support any of their local breweries... boo!!!! But the 1 DIPA available that I tried was a comfort to my beer & burger snob ways..."}
{"text":"Best burger and service I've had. The meat combination was perfect and so were the burger choices. Really hit the spot."}
{"text":"40 minutes wait and then 2 hours to finish eating. Service is very slow. Food is decent. Overhyped in my opinion."}
{"text":"If this is the standard for Gordon Ramsey, then I wouldn't try a higher end place. For as much as he talks about seasoning, there certainly wasn't any on my burgers or fries except for cumin in the ketchup which was less than appealing. I just went with the plain Backyard burger hoping for good flavor but apparently you need to slather it with 3 different cheese and sauces and bacon to make it taste good.  I would skip this place and go straight to Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Great service and food: fabulous atmosphere with British Invasion sound track. Love the fired signage. Sat at the bar where I was addressed by name. All about the details!"}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with the \"Forest\" burger it was cooked to perfection. The exceptionally juicy burger was topped with tremor cheese, arugula, grilled mushrooms and duck bacon. The combination of the arugula, cheese and duck bacon was a flavor explosion. Again, the duck bacon was such a unique twist on the traditional \"bacon\" burger. Everything was on point including the service. A must go! Reasonable priced as well. Dessert was ."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. The Backyard Burger was so good. The taste of the butter in the lettuce. Would definitely recommend eating here. The staff was good as well. I would fly to Vegas just to eat here. One of the best burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"The line looked long to get in but for two people we were seated pretty quick at the bar. Service was whatever not friendly but not rude either. Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger ($17) and my boyfriend got the blue cheeseburger and we shared some Parmesan fries ($12). The food wasn't as great as i thought, I've had better burgers. I ended up getting food poisoning and spent one of my vacation days in Vegas in bed recovering my boyfriend also felt sick after his meal. Save yourself the money and the stomach ache do not eat here."}
{"text":"You have no idea how much it PAINS me to give a restaurant named after the man himself anything less than a perfect score. Anyone who knows me knows that I have a strange yet justified obsession with all things Gordon Ramsey. That being said, my visit here was just not great. My friend and I sat at the bar because they said it would be a long wait and we just wanted to split a burger and truffle fries. The bartender told us the burger would take roughly 30 mins and I wasn't terribly upset about it because come on... perfection takes time lol in actuality the burger didn't come for an hour. And that was annoying because it was getting late and an hour to make a burger is kinda ridiculous lol   The burger itself was cold, very salty and kind of fell apart as you tried to eat it. The bartender was not attentive to us at all. After she took our order we didn't see her again. She spent most of the time talking to a friend.  In fact, when we finished a separate waiter saw us sitting there waiting and took our plates.  The only saving grace were the truffle fries but they are pricy.   Overall I wouldn't return if I visit Vegas again. Prices were too high for the product and the service during this visit wasn't great.    Still love Gordon though"}
{"text":"I ordered the short ribs and a glass of wine. The short ribs were very dry. I had to drink a swig of wine for the meat to go down.  Over cooked food with a name."}
{"text":"First time to try the Gordon Ramsey burger! I was delicious! Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"One of my \"have to go\" places before my first trip to Vegas. Waited a while in line and got seated by very pleasant hostesses. Wait staff also was amazing and very friendly. The food was what I had an issue with. It took FOREVER to get our food!!! Almost 40 mins for burgers to come out. The fries were cold when they came out. I was sorely disappointed!!"}
{"text":"1 word: YUMMY!  My husband and I went to Burger Saturday afternoon for lunch around 1pm.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table.  Once we were seated, we were almost immediately greeted by our server.  I can't remember his name, but he was GREAT!  He made an excellent suggestion about a secret burger (the F Word burger), that my husband ended up ordering.  It was a little pricey, but well worth it.  I had the Farmhouse burger, and then we shared the truffle fries.  So so good!!!  I must also add that this was not our 1st visit here, but probably the best food and service that we have ever received.  On that note, I am already looking forward to dining at Gordon Ramsay Burger again!"}
{"text":"Really overrated. Waited about an hour for a seat then another 30 minutes to get our food. This was at 2pm on a Sunday. I was looking around at the tables and seemed like everyone was just waiting for their food with empty tables. The hog burger was $18. the pork was overpowering. It comes in a super thick pork patty, wrapped in bacon, topped with shredded pork. They should've given more Cole slaw. I couldn't finish the pork patty because it was so thick and so I left it on the plate and the smell of it was making me noxious. Very strong pork smell. Everything was just mediocre. Can't say it's worth the money. Total was about  $170 for five people."}
{"text":"THE. BEST. BURGER. EVER.  Literally words can't describe how flavorful, tender, and juicy this burger was. I love a good classic burger that uses fresh ingredients that compliment each other, instead of relying on gimmicky crap. I got the crown burger and it was outstanding. The bun was perfection, the tomatoes and fresh herb aioli was perfect together. The arugula was a great addition to the burger. We also had the curried shrimp salad which was very tasty and full of good flavors as well. Drinks are good too. I will be back for those delicious burgers. Definitely lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Good once. Maybe their shake will bring me back for a second try.  $50 for a burger, fries, and shake...and quite a long wait.  I stood in line for about 1/2 an hour just before 3pm on a Saturday, which was understandable. After being seated at the bar, the server took my order within a few minutes.  I ordered the Hog Burger, Truffle Parmesan Fries, and a Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake.  The shake came out within 5 or 10 minutes, followed shortly by the fries.  However, it was somewhere between 35 to 40 minutes before my burger came out. The server had warned of a 25-30 minute wait, and I had accepted that. However, by then, the fries were lukewarm, and my shake had been devoured as it was absolutely delicious.  The overwhelming memory of the Hog Burger was its dryness. The generous serving of patty was cooked to a perfect medium as suggested by the server, but I found myself requiring a lot of water to offset the dryness of the entire burger.  On one hand, this was a nice change to the usual grease-drenched burgers at other establishments, but perhaps a light spread would make the burger more enjoyable.   The Truffle Parmesan fries were just ok. There was a light sprinkle of parmesan over the top of the fries, which lead to a rather uneven distribution of the cheese once you got to the fries hiding at the bottom, especially since they were served in a cone.  There were two interesting sauces; one was red and mildly spicy(chipotle ketchup) and the other was a yellow creamy blend(truffle aioli).  One of the barbacks/assistants made my service experience excellent. He filled in for my server and refilled water regularly and noticed that I was scrutinizing my prestained fork and offered to replace it without my having to ask.   Overall, not a satisfying first experience with their burger and fries, but I've only sampled a small portion of their menu."}
{"text":"Burgers are good. I ordered a hog burger and liked it. My friend ordered the hell's burger and it was good too (if you like spicy). Fries and crepe br√ªl√©e drink were alright. Like the fire display out front too."}
{"text":"This place was definitely over hyped for us.   I came here with my boyfriend around 11pm but called before to see what time their kitchen closes. The waitress said their kitchen is open until 11:55pm, which is nice since they actually close at 12am and they are willing to still serve you.   Upon arriving, we see the famous Gordan Ramsay sign lit up with fire behind it. We were super excited about trying this place out, especially after reading the reviews.   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger medium rare along with the truffle fries. Nothing stood out about it. I've honestly had better burgers for a better price. I usually prefer avocado in my burger to be more guac style but here they cut it into slices for you. Also, there is tomato in it and it was cold and stood out (in a bad way) from the burger.   For the name, I expected better food. The price was decent since everything on the Strip is usually around there though.   Would I recommend or come back? No."}
{"text":"Burger ottimo, patatine un po' pesanti. Meglio puntare al burger. L'attesa √® valsa la pena. Blue cheeseburger + backyard. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"}
{"text":"With a location bearing the famous Gordon Ramsay's name, I expected much more.   SERVICE: The service was the most upsetting as the waitresses were extremely frustrating. I came with a party of 9 with them originally saying 45 minutes. After an hour, I asked of the status and a lady stated that \"it'll be 10 more minutes since they are now cashing out.\" Half an hour later, we, again, asked of the status. Their response: \"oh, we gave it to another group. Sorry. It'll be 15 more minutes.\" Each time we asked of the status, they would change the story of which table was \"finishing up\" and that it would be \"another 15 minutes.\"  Guess what? 40 minutes later, they still have not gotten us a table and we are the longest waiting group. Total wait time was 2.5 hours when they originally promised 45 minutes.   The service is poor and frustrating for such a famous location. If this location were to improve, improve the waitresses as they are just willing to improvise false stories and wait times.   FOOD: We decided to stay for the food since they made us wait 2.5 hours for a table they kept promising. The food was mediocre at best. The poutine was extremely salty and would bring even the healthiest person into hypertensive crisis. The meat was overcooked despite ordering a medium-- just overpriced for the hype. I am disappointed to give this a poor review especially since I am a big fan of Chef Ramsay.   ADVICE: Avoid this place. Just check out the Bobby Flay burgers near by. They treat you with respect there and the food is superior."}
{"text":"Came here 20 minutes before closing and sat at the bar. The host greeted us and was friendly. The bar server was cool and attentive.  The hell's kitchen burger which is there best seller was soooo good. I added an egg which cost 3 bucks extra.  Their shakes are awesome. Their caramel with pecan sounds super sweet but wasn't too sweet at all.  Their oreo tiramisu shake is the bomb! definitely a must get if you're not on a calorie count lol"}
{"text":"Over priced, over hyped, mediocre burgers.  The wait to sit is long. The wait to get your food is even longer. Burgers are around $15 and up. Fries are not included and they will run you $8, $11 if you want truffle fries.   The burger patties are DRY. I wanted to try a specialty burger so I went with the Hog Burger ($18) and BF went with the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($15). Both of the patties were dry. We also got the truffle fries ($11) and they were steak fries which I am not a fan of. Also, they came out lukewarm. Now, I have no problem with the price if the burgers are good. I understand this is Vegas, on the strip, so I understand the high prices. But if I'm paying for those prices, I expect it to be good. I've had super premium dry age beef burgers upwards to $26 to greasy spoon burgers, and I love them all as long as they are good. I rather eat In-N-Out, Shake Shack, even Five Guys that I don't like that much over Gordon Ramsay Burger. Even if they are the same price.   The service is a whole 'nother thing. We waited close to an hour for the burgers to come out. The server explain that it takes them 45 minutes to an hour to cook the burgers. At least they could have given us the fries beforehand? And how come some people got their stuff quicker than us? We were highly suspicious they dropped our order or something went wrong in the back. Around 30 minute mark, we asked about our order and they said our burgers were next. Another 15 minute and no burgers. 50 minutes ish, the burgers come out and a bit later the manager comes over to apologize and explain, but there isn't much of an explanation. He says he'll get us a free beer or a shake but I know I'm gonna be way too full for that. I'd rather he comped the mediocre fries or something but oh well.  In the end, the bill was over $60 for two burgers, fries, and a beer. And a highly regrettable choice of meal for our short time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I went here on Friday night about 11 PM (party of two) and they asked if we wanted kitchen bar seating which we were fine with. Our waiter was quick and provided very good service throughout the experience. I got the Cheeseburger and it is AMAZING it has 3 different cheeses! :) for the price I wish that it came with fries but the burger was enough for a late night meal. I have gotten this burger before about a year and a half ago and I never have forgotten about it and it is just as good as last time!"}
{"text":"I didn't really wanna eat here, honestly. It looked frou-frou and overpriced from outside. I was glad we did, though. I was wrong. Burger was very enjoyable.  The food is not ridiculously overpriced. Pretty amazing food, too, actually. I can honestly say the Hell's Kitchen Burger was one of the best burgers I've had. I'd pass on the Tandoori Chicken Burger, though -- it's good, but nothing special.  The truffle fries with dipping sauces were delicious and big enough for two to share.  Service was pretty good, too. Friendly staff, drinks always refilled quickly. Food took 25 minutes to come out, but our server warned us about it ahead of time. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"My pregnant wife and I just got sat after waiting in line for over an hour, which I wouldn't have minded so much except that they were taking everyone it would be a 30 minute wait. Then, when we finally got seated and didn't see a waiter in the first 8 minutes, we were told as we ordered that it would be another 40 minutes before we got our food. If I would have know it would be almost exactly 2 hours from getting in line to receiving my food, I seriously would have gone to Panda Express. No overpriced burger is worth this. Las Vegas strip location."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a good burger and the first time I came here, I was beyond satisfied. The service was great, I never had to hound a server down like I do at some other restaurants. I sat at the bar and I love the fact that all of the workers were genuinely smiling, having a great time and getting along, stress-free. It created an exciting and very joyful experience and I will be going back.  Burger suggestion: The Hog Burger"}
{"text":"Terrible Experience! No reservations accepted...so after waiting an hour at lunchtime, we're seated at a table that is basically in the hotel entrance way. Then we waited an additional forty minutes for our food. We mentioned all of this to our waiter, who apologized, agreed, but claimed no ability to affect the situation. I  complained to the Manager, trying to be much more gracious than Gordon Ramsay. He as well claimed no accountability. I'm writing this YELP review, trying to be much more gracious than Gordon Ramsay. Either Gordon Ramsay has no idea what is going on at this restaurant or he is a SHAM."}
{"text":"Amazingly good burgers for a very decent price! The burgers are perfect, the paddies great. And the combinations are great! Have tasted the hells kitchen and blue cheese burgers. Both were really tasty. Also good service."}
{"text":"finally tried this over memorial day weekend. called ahead to see if there was a wait and they said about 25-30 min wait for lunch. walked in through the door and saw a long line but apparently that was for parties of 2? we gave our number to the hostess and they would text us when our table was ready. shopped around planet hollywood for about 15-20 mins and our table was ready. i rely heavily on yelp pictures so even though the menu sounded good i had to check yelp. i ended up getting the farmhouse burger medium rare, my friends got the hog burger (its pork so they can only serve it medium at the most), and the hells kitchen burger. we also got the onion rings (delish!), fries (amazing), and the sweet potato fries(ordinary). the fries are huge btw. can def share with your group. they also had a lot of different sauces you can dip them in. we also asked for the aioli which i looove with my burgers. everything was so juicy and delicious! definitely come here it is worth a try! gordon ramsay lives up to his name!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place high marks, because the food was fantastic. The foie gras burger was definitely the best burger I've ever eaten, but there were two things that bugged me about my visit. The glass that my beer was served in was not very clean, and had visible food residue from the previous customer on it. I'm pretty sure I got sick from it, and looking back I should have asked for a new glass, but it was pretty hard to get a hold of our waiter. Speaking of which, it took nearly 20 minutes for our waiter to come collect our bill. It was a busy day, but I feel like a restaurant with a high-profile name like Gordon Ramsay on the front should be able to handle a full load of customers with little to no difficulty.   Overall I was satisfied with the food, but the service and cleanliness could definitely be improved upon."}
{"text":"Stood in line for 45 minutes just to taste this burger. The wait was worth it."}
{"text":"I love Gordon Ramsay, however, it is not worth the price and the wait :/ I mean it's in Las Vegas so yes, you have to wait for almost everything but I really don't see myself from going back there even if I were to visit NV again.   The sangria is actually really delicious, but again, kind of pricey.  I wouldn't highly recommend but it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to try it here once in your life."}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! My husband surprised me with a trip to Las Vegas, and I was most excited about going to Gordon Ramsay burger! It did not disappoint! I got the farmhouse burger, my husband got the crown burger and we got delicious kettle chip nachos as an appetizer! Even though the burgers were delicious, the nachos were hands down one of the best things I've ever eaten. I was literally making questionable noises while eating them because they were that good. We also got truffle fries, which were probably the weakest thing we got, but still good. We got really in to truffle last year when we went to Italy, and when you order truffle anything in the US, they give you a little measly bit of truffle. Not GRB, they loaded it up. It was almost too much truffle. Other than that, I can't wait to go back!! My favorite part of Vegas!"}
{"text":"Everything was good except the seafood burger. It was really weird and did have a good taste."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner during our first night stay and I am in love with the Hog Burger. For someone who does not eat beef, this was the perfect burger anyone could ask for. It had a huge patty (see my pictures) and was filled with flavor. There was about an hour wait but luckily I was able to get seated within 5 minutes since I am a PLATNIUM member. GET PLATINUM PEOPLE, YOU SKIP LINES! The food took awhile to come since it was super busy. The Truffle Fries came first which were pretty tasty. I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"AMAZING burgers!!! Definitely will come back here when I come to Vegas next ;) Great service even tho they were super busy!! Sweet potato fries were to die for!"}
{"text":"It's good but is it worth the wait? I'd give this place 3.5 stars. The restaurant is eye catching, it has flames to draw you in. Oh and don't forget the star power name attached to the place. But once you get inside, it kinda feels like an upscale diner.   It has a mix of counter, low and high table seating which seems plenty but the place has built quite the reputation and can certainly draw a crowd. If you don't mind the wait the food is pretty good. They take your favorite burgers and fries and kick it up a notch. I had the anniversary burger and truffle fries. The burger is made in limited amounts so ask ahead to see if they have any. The gourmet beef patties are cooked over an open flame using prime cuts of meat. And of course the fries are generously coated with a taste of rich truffles.  If the line is short I'll probably pop in again."}
{"text":"Tried onion rings for the table, which were great. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger, absolutely delicious. Save room for dessert too! I tried the Creme Br√ªl√©e shake and loved it! Great stop if your visiting Planet Hollywood & Miracle Mile Shops."}
{"text":"** Good but I'm not sure it's worth $25 and the line!**  Happened across this new burger place located in planet Hollywood. There was a line and someone told us the the wait was 2 hours or 2 people.   We decided to order take out at the front corner and wander around the Casino while we waited  1 hour...  for a burger (yikes)  They have a lobster burger which was intriguing but we ordered the steak cut Truffle fries ($11 amazing) and 2 burgers: Hell's Kitchen (most popular) with jalape√±os  and the Patriot (Turkey burger with shoestring frites and cherry compote)   Total cost was around $48 or $25 each ( we shared fries). Serving size is reasonable. all in all a good burger but Vegas is  overpriced, he's a world renown chef, and I'm sure I won't return - there's too many options"}
{"text":"It was awesome 3 years ago but this time the burger patty was really dry. They dont have the coffee shake anymore either."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in Las Vegas!!! The burgers are absolutely phenomenal!!! My favorite is the Hell's Kitchen burger and the backyard burger!!! I always order onion rings as well they are so delicious !!! I highly recommend trying this place out if you haven't yet. There's usually always a line but in my opinion the food is worth the wait. If you have never had poutine you should defiantly try that while your here to. The burgers are huge so my boyfriend and I usually share one so go hungry. We usually make it a point to at least go once or twice a year. In my opinion it's the best burgers I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Probably the B E S T burger I have ever had that I didn't produce myself. They only serve 100 burgers of this style...when gone, they are gone. Aged NY blended with rib meat, and a true medium rare was spot on!"}
{"text":"Looked forward in trying Gordon's burger restaurant. Was it the best burger I have ever had? Nope. It was perfectly cooked (medium well) and very juicy. Cheese was fresh and a nice bun. Homemade ketchup was a nice touch. Onion rings were excellent. We left still feeling a little hungry as the burger size was on the smaller side. Service was outstanding!!!  Two burgers, onion rings and an ice tea came to $60 including tip. If you do want the best burger The Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay is the best anywhere and at half the price."}
{"text":"You're better off eating at Red Robin (it's cheaper and around the same quality). Poutine is absolute rubbish (it's basically just fries slathered in spicy pepper sauce). I've had better poutine from a Canadian Costco. Burger was majorly over cooked (ordered medium rare, got well done). Cheese looks and tastes like Kraft singles. For a man who has a show called \"Hells Kitchen\", the food here certainly came directly from hell. And I love Gordon! But the quality of food here is just atrocious. And there was cheese on the bill folder and brown crust on a \"fresh\" served plate. and it's basically a sports bar atmosphere. Step it up Ramsay!"}
{"text":"Just a Burger? I think Not Whats going on here? Whats going on here is that there is a flow of flavores that are dancing delightedly on my tongue. A melding of a symphony of flavors that were developed by a genius. I had the Forest burger and I would have it again and again."}
{"text":"I was worried that this restaurant being owned by Chef Ramsay would not live up to his standards that I've seen on his shows.  My best friend and I were on a girls trip and I wanted to check it out.  We waited in line for 30min not too bad considering.  We both ordered a burger, with a side order of fries and onion rings.  WOW!  Burger was juicy, had a lot of flavor and cooked the way I asked.  Just observing while I was eating noticed waiters were on it.  Cleaning tables and chairs as soon as people were done eating.  A+.  If you're looking for a great burger this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Annual run to my favorite burger spot! ($15 burger) Since I've tried 5 years ago, I've been going back here annually to enjoy the burger. The name has changed from \"BurGR\" to \"Gordon Ramsay Burger\" located at Paris Casino. All the names on Menu has been updated into new names but seems like the ingredients haven't changed.  I had to go back home right away so we decided to choose TOGO, and it was great experience. The girls at the front helped me with new menu and it was fairly fast. (Explained it's almost the same as other older menu) The food took about 30-40min to come out but looking at the Line, I would rather gamble some $ while waiting for food to come out.  Food came out pretty warm and it was awesome burger!!  We will be back again next year~!"}
{"text":"This place is a hype, the burgers are not with the amount of money you'd be paying for. But the chicken wings are the best I've had. I ordered a set of wings, the crab shrimp burger, lamb burger, and the firehouse burger; all of them were good but just didn't have a punch. They came with sweet potato fries and normal fries; the sweet potato fries were also just okay because they added some white powder to it and it was way too salty and the normal fries were too dry and soft, as I felt like I'm eat mashed potato sticks that were fried. I also ordered their crum Berle Oreo shake and pecan caramel shake, the Oreo shake was phenomenal. But the burgers are whack, so 2 out of 5 because I went there for a burger, the burgers were trash for the hype this place was. The fries were trash and any beginner can do better, the burger was a hype and some franchise restaurants are much better and cheaper(BJ's brewhouse), but the chicken wings are too die for and the Oreo shake was unreal."}
{"text":"His steak place at the Paris Hotel is to die for.  This place, not so much.  Expected a lot more for the price.  Burgers are expensive, which I expected, but they should have been excellent.  Don't go if you expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"I'm (pretty much) obsessed with Gordon Ramsay so I was ecstatic to be in Vegas with a chance to dine at one of his restaurants. Steak was out of price range (poverty college student) so burgers it was.   Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger ($15) and truffle fries ($11) to share. The burger was delicious, with a nice kick of heat. Perfectly cooked. The truffle fries were okay - the parmesan was a little overpowering and seemed to absorb much of the truffle oil.   The place is located in Planet Hollywood. It's got a very modern posh look. We came at 11:30am on a Tuesday and had no wait for food...unfortunately after ordering, our food took at least 30 minutes to come out! Luckily I was in good company so there was plenty to talk about but it really was a long time for burgers and fries. Service was just okay, as the server only came by once early on in our wait. The server was knowledgeable about the menu but really didn't display much interest in us after we ordered. The place also doesn't take reservations, so  it can get crowded at peak hours.  Bottom line: It's as tasty as you'd expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. A little pricey but it's Vegas and it does have the Ramsay name. Prepare for a length wait for the food, sadly.  Anecdote: The table of four next to us also had a long wait for their food, so much so that the manager came out to talk to them. They waited for over 25 minutes, which apparently is the policy there. We definitely waited just as long, but no manager came to talk to us - probably because we are potatoes. Sad."}
{"text":"One word: over-hyped. We were excited to try this place after passing by it year after year, so we came in for dinner. We got there around 5 and there was a bit of a line, but we were seated within 30 minutes. We ordered the nachos, Hell's Kitchen burgers, and truffle fries.   Within ten minutes we were greeted by a special little guest--a baby cockroach came out to play right by our feet! We were pretty surprised that, what with Gordon Ramsay's habit of battering restaurant owners for their unwelcome pests, he had some in his own restaurant. At least it was only a baby and not that grotesque, but it was still pretty freaky to see at a place where you're about to eat. We told a passing waiter and were moved a couple tables down by the manager, although I'm not sure they ultimately did anything about the cockroach.  On to the food--it was all unimpressive. Everything seemed to be made of good quality ingredients, but lacked flavor overall. The burger seemed to have a good bun, and the meat appeared juicy, but again, no flavor. The nachos were fairly good. The truffle fries were a let-down.   It was just a very \"meh\" meal. There are many, many better places to get a burger on the Strip."}
{"text":"If the food wasn't good enough, Paul and Brandon just completed our dining experience"}
{"text":"Really awesome place!! Had the mushroom burger since I'm vegan and the onion rings!! It was flavourful and did not disappoint. Definitely on the pricey side for burgers but worth every penny!! I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"If you want to spend 3 to 4 hours just to heating to Bruegger. Then you can go  tease please. The food is good but the service is horrible"}
{"text":"This place was defiantly great, amazing hamburger, beautiful decor. I only had one complaint that makes this a 4 star was the waitress I had. The waitress was Dorota and all she did was talk to her coworkers when they themselves were working and sitting in a corner laughing with the other workers. She never swung by our table unless we asked another waiter to get us something. Polite but she never came by to check up on us. Overall very great experience aside from the waitress!"}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing. Everything tasted fresh and amazing. Get the farmhouse burger, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"They have really great burgers!! And great customer service.  They slightly messed up my husband's order,  and they were very proactive in correcting it. The manager even came out to apologize, and it was such a small mix up!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was located in the hotel/casino we stayed at so it was an easy pick to go here for lunch. I passed by the restaurant several times during my last visit to vegas and there always seemed to be a line. Thank goodness we had reservations and was seated within 15 minutes of checking in.   Since I don't eat meat I decided to go for the Portobello mushroom burger which was over $20. I shared onion rings, sweet potato fries, and truffle fries with others. The burger itself wasn't that memorable and the fries were not the best. I think the onion rings were good though.   All in all, service was meh maybe because they were busy. I probably will not return though just because it's vegas and there are so many other restaurants that taste better. =/"}
{"text":"Refused seating at 12pm claiming that they were only seating for the Super Bowl, which didn't start until 3pm. We would've eaten, paid and been back at our room long before the pregame show. They also failed to post this restriction on their website, meaning we walked a mile in the Nevada heat for nothing. As a Total Rewards Diamond member, I am not impressed and it would seem that my business is more welcomed over at MGM properties."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. On the last day of our trip, my husband and I decided to give the line a shot. 30 mins before opening, we began to line up. We were the first to be seated and first to have our burgers served. Although we were the first, it still took 30 mins for the burgers to be mad after we placed our order! Def pack your patience and don't come too hungry!   Lobster and shrimp burger - saw it on \"Worth It\" Buzzfeed channel aka basically  what we came for. In sum, it reminded me of eating a bunch of shui mai  (dim sum dumplings) sandwiched into a burger. Not exactly how I imagined it.. tasted fine but a little plain to be honest. With pickled  carrots as the only topping, it became boring almost immediately.   Hells Kitchen's burger - traditional burger with jalape√±os chili and avocado slices - tasty but compared to Holstein's the night before, it was pretty forgettable. Safe choice for those trying out Gordon Ramsey's burger for the first time though - original flavor with a slight twist.   Sweet potato fries - game changer! - going to start dusting all my fries in powdered sugar.   Overall - good burger but definitely not worth the ridiculous line/wait line."}
{"text":"Long wait, mediocre at best food. Overpriced for what you get and restaurant employees indifferent to you. I don't think they're concerned if you're satisfied or not, there's a line at the door waiting for your table."}
{"text":"I must say great experience from their service to their food AMAZING everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and their  juices we were made fresh absolutely recommend trying this restaurant out u won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I have had a lot of burgers in many places, but this was hands down the best burger I've had to date.  I ordered the Crown Burger, and asked for the chef's recommendation on cook level, which the waiter informed me was medium rare...soooo glad I asked!  The burger was so flavorful and juicy.  I have never used this term on a burger before, and didn't think it was possible, but the meat seemed to melt in my mouth!  Everything on the burger worked well together, the seasoning on the bun ('everything' seasoning maybe?) had a little saltiness and a bit of crunch to the soft bread, the herb aioli was delicious, the arugula was a perfect leafy green to the burg, the ONLY thing I might have changed is to have a slightly heartier slice of the mimolette cheese on the meat.  Also had the truffle fries which were amazing good -- they came out nice and hot and the truffle was not overpowering.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"Most delicious burger I have had till date. They make a simple burger to perfection. Food is just so fresh and cooked to perfection. If you are looking for quality not quantity do visit Ramsey burger"}
{"text":"burger was okay, a bit dry. but sides were amazing. unique flavors and dishes."}
{"text":"The onion rings are AWESOME here! Creme br√ªl√©e oreo milkshake was also killer. Burgers on the salty side."}
{"text":"Been to Steak and Pub a few times-this was the first trip to Burger. Had the Hells Kitchen Burger, a regular Cheese Burger, regular fries, and Onion Rings.  So the highlight of the meal is definitely the onion rings!  Amazing. I would go back just for them. Fries were mediocre at best (way better at Pub). The ketchups are interesting... I would have preferred regular- but they don't have it (eye roll). The burgers were cooked well, nothing special. The HK burger had really good/hot green chile - and I'm from New Mexico and know my green chile. The peppers on it (poblano?). I could have definitely done without. Shakes were amazing as well!  Filling!!"}
{"text":"Ok so we did it.  We fell for the tourist trap celebrity chef burger joint.  The difference is we knew we were falling for the tourist trap that is celebrity chef burger joints.  The lady friend and I came here to get our traditional vacation burger fix.  No matter the trip, we always end up at a local burger establishment.  We decided on this one because of the namesake celebrity chef.  The restaurant has a very chain like feel and it's extremely busy.  The wait staff is flying around in circles trying to hurry up and turn those tables!  They want you to scarf down those 20.00 burgers so they can get the next sucker in here to buy a 20.00 burger.    I had the farmhouse burger which comes with a fancy cheese, fancy bacon and a fried egg.  They cook the burgers to order and the fried egg oozes out upon 1st bite.  The burger is actually pretty damn good but it's 17.00 and comes with nothing else.  The fries are fresh cut and have to be ordered separately for 8.00.  Now the fries will feed 2.  We each ordered 2 beers to wash it down.  4 beers, 2 burgers and 1 fry and I spent damn near the same money as a 5 star restaurant back home in Nola.  The food was solid but you are paying for the neon light bill of the casino it's in.  Be warned"}
{"text":"Same location as the previous \"BURGR\" in Planet Hollywood but changed a little bit and is now \"Gordon Ramsay Burger\". The menu added/removed some items and the restaurant has a more UK theme now. I tried the Crown Burger which was not on the previous BURGR menu, and it came with aged mimolette cheese, arugula, fine herb aioli, and sun dried tomatoes. The meat was cooked perfectly medium, and it was juicy and seasoned well. The mimolette cheese resembled almost a sharp cheddar to me and added a nice savoriness to the burger, but it wasn't overly salty due to the bitterness of the arugula and sweetness of the sun dried tomatoes. The aioli wasn't overpowering and complimented the other flavors of the burger, I'd order it again! Truffle fries are a must when I come here, and the truffle dipping sauce is soo good. It did take a little while for the food to come out but it's worth the wait. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas and it's affordable/not outrageously priced."}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible value in my book.  The service is terribly slow.  We (party of two) waited ten minutes to be seated (not a big deal), then after we ordered our drinks (water) it took another ten minutes to get them and be able to put our order in (not a big deal).  Then, it took us almost an hour for us to get our food (very big deal).  The menu is essentially just burgers and fries (we ordered two burgers and one order of fries) which are two of the simplest and fast cooking meals one could order at a sit-down restaurant (an entire industry known for \"fast food\" is built around burgers and fries).  It should never take that long to serve these items.  Again, service was inattentive.  We tried the sauce that came with the fries and didn't like it so we waited at least five minutes for our server to walk by so we could ask for Ketchup.  She said sure and returned with a third cup/dish of the same sauce.  We both tried it and looked at each other in amazement.  We waited at least five more minutes to be able to ask if there was any real Ketchup.  We were advised that there was not.  This put us over the edge.  My girlfriend like simple burgers with Ketchup and I, having already started eating mine (we were starving when we sat down), felt like the burger was mediocre (not a difficult item to make tasty).  Additionally, the fries (more like potato wedges) were bland and mostly hard - a condition that would have been easily mitigated with some Ketchup.  We finished our burgers in extreme disappointment.  Upon finishing, it took another 5-10 minutes for our plates to be cleared and then another five or so for our check to come back.  After providing my credit card, it took 5-10 minutes for it to be picked up and several more to be brought back to sign.  Once I had the check signed, we waited for our server to return to ask for a box for the nearly untouched order of fries so we could take them home and eat after getting our hands on some Ketchup.  We waited at least five minutes.  She came back shortly with the box and we promptly left the table.  On my way out, I spoke with the/a manager and advised him that the operations of the restaurant are poor and need work.  I also strongly suggested that the restaurant, a \"traditional American\" burger joint offer real Ketchup to which he responded \"that will never happen.\"  That doesn't bother me because I will never eat there again, but I think it highlights a major issue with the restaurant.  The restaurant is not focused on providing a premier dining experience for customers but is solely geared toward attracting people with the brand name.  As is evidenced by the restaurant name, and Gordon Ramsay's face all around the restaurant as if he is superhuman, this restaurant, and Gordon Ramsay, is the poster-child for arrogance.  This is an expensive burger-joint.  $15 for just a burger, with no slaw or fries included.  Burgers are an easy dish - creating your own doesn't make you special.  Fries are simple as well.  Homemade fries are great, and always a little unique.  But let's not pretend as through they are a specialty item.  And Ketchup.  Well, Ketchup has been around a long time and is an All-American condiment.  To suggest that Gordon Ramsay could create a house sauce that is so good that nobody would ever prefer real, traditional Ketchup...is insane.  To call the house sauce \"Ketchup\" is misleading.  Not to mention that the sauce is actually terrible.  It tastes nothing like Ketchup and, to us, resembled a smoky shrimp cocktail sauce.  All said, I could never recommend this place. Food is sub-par, service is poor, and customer satisfaction is not a priority.  Arrogance permeates the atmosphere as the restaurant relies on the brand name to lure customers to pay high prices for cheap food.  Note:  The couple sitting next to us left in disgust shortly after receiving their meals.  We were only able to infer that something was terribly wrong with the food.  Either a grossly undercooked burger, a hair or other item in the food, or...no Ketchup (I had seen her spreading a giant glob of sauce on her bun/burger shortly before the server was beckoned to her.  The woman asked that her plate be taken away and declined an offer for any substitute dish.  The man stopped eating and asked for the check.  The manager who I ultimately spoke with, brought the couple the check and made an apology.  Note, he still brought the check which the man paid (over $60).  This does not seem like a genuine apology nor does it indicate any acceptance of responsibility on behalf of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the Forest burger and it was so good! The burgers don't come with fries, you have to order them separately. The parmesan fries were also good! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay's Burger never fails to disappoint. The burgers are always spot on. We got the Truffle Parmesan Fries, the Hog Burger and the Turkey burger (I think it was Turdunken Burger? ). The truffle parmesan fries were amazing (as always); I loved the Truffle aioli that comes with it. The pork pattyy in the Hog Burger was juicy and, and the pork bbq was just perfect. We so got a couple of cocktails.. The rum punch, bad donkey and another fruity cocktail. The cocktails were a bit disappointing though (definitely needs improvement).   All in all, it was a good experience and would definitely be back for the burgers and fries. Be prepared for the wait though. We had to wait almost an hour for a table for two."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay babe I love you so much. You just know how to make my day. The only negative thing I can say about this place is that I have nothing negative to say. I've had some good burgers which is the ones I make, but this burger was like a golden burger from heaven, I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. Gordon marry me please!"}
{"text":"You may be turned off from this place since you have to wait in line for about 30 minutes but let me tell you, it's worth the wait.   We were first skeptical of this place since most gourmet burgers are typically good but how much better can you get by going to this place? TONS!  This place is definitely a must visit... It's a Gordon Ramsey for God's sake.  For starters, the onion rings have a great crisp and flavor.  It is served with home made ketchup and their home made ranch.  They also have a french fry with a curry dip... Delicious!   If you are hesitant on  burger choices, I recommend the Hog burger . Patty made out of beef Chuck, brisket and bacon which is then wrapped in bacon and topped with bacon, BBQ pulled pork, coleslaw, pickles and fried onions!  AMAZING!!!  They also have great shakes and an amazing chocolate dessert as Gordon Ramsey would do.   You definitely have to make it out....SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately Gordon Ramsey Burger served me both the most expensive and the worst burger I had during my trip here. Not that the burger was terrible or anything, but all the fancy ingredients left me with a pretty average experience. The anniversary burger was pretty flavorless, despite the aged steak used to make the burger. The hog burger was a little better, being juicier and better seasoned.   The Irish nachos we had as an appetizer were absolutely amazing!! The corned beef was savory and sweet, and the cheese sauce that drenched the nachos was divine. Unfortunately even that hardly redeemed the overall experience here."}
{"text":"Ordered the truffle fries and Blue burger. All delicious. Ask to sample their sauces (especially the white cheddar and smoky chipotle) to really experience good flavor."}
{"text":"Tip: parties of 5 or more don't have to wait in line, walk up to the hostess stand and they'll text you when your tables about to be ready. We got so lucky with our party of 5 and were able to walk around and shop then go back upstairs to our room at Planet Hollywood to relax. The wait was about 1.5 hours, we sat at 7:30PM.   Price: super reasonable prices especially for the Gordon Ramsey name and it being located on The Strip!   Appetizers came out super quick, took about 2 minutes, it came before our server even gave us our water lol Kettle Chip Nachos: instead of traditional tortilla chips they use kettle cooked potato chips, I feel like this is up to personal preference. I wasn't too crazy about it cause the toppings made the chips soggy but everyone else in my party loved it. They weren't skimp on the meats either.  Beer Battered Onion Rings: super crispy and a good portion to share. Good but nothing too special. Parmesan Truffle Fries: the truffle dipping sauce was really good! Again, good size to share with 2-3 people. This didn't come out until the burgers which I thought was thoughtful of them haha. Cheddar Ale Soup: I wouldn't recommend, it was kind of plain and super super salty.  Took about 15-20 minutes after appetizers for the burgers to come out Our party ended up getting very similar burgers but all the burgers were excellent and cooked perfectly to medium rare, they were also hot temperature wise which I loved, I hate lukewarm food! :)  Hell's Kitchen Burger: LOVED IT! Two of us got this and both reviews were a thumbs up. Super juicy and moist, buns are important to me in a burger and I loved how the bread never got soggy. They weren't skimp with the avocado and there was a spicy kick but nothing too overwhelming. TIP: try adding some of the truffle sauce from the fries on this, heavenly!  Farmhouse Burger: who could go wrong with a fried egg? The mangalitsa bacon really pulled this burger together! I couldn't help but steal a couple bites!   Backyard Burger: a classic burger but nevertheless a good burger!  Can't wait to be back and try some of the more exotic options like the Blue Cheese or Foie Burger, I love foie gras.  Recommend going early cause lines get long, don't go during prime time like lunch or dinner. We walked past at 10:45AM, 15 minutes before opening and there was already a line! The line at dinner was super long but as I've observed, 2 and 3 top tables get turned over pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a detour if you love burgers. Their burr here are always juicy and well built. Recently had the backyard burger, a simple burger with cheese lettuce and tomato. This let's you taste and enjoy the meat without too many other flavors...well worth it. Also had the wheat berry quinoa salad with chicken skewers. Only complaint about that was the chicken. Taste was great but had a lot of fat and cartilage on it. If you like lean white meat it won't suit your tastes. Or maybe that was just our order.   Truffle park fries complemented the burger well. Also they have an impressive beer list which was great. They also carry la fin du monde on draft which was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"This place must not pay their help well. Some quit tonight. Waiting forever for a table of three.  If it wasn't for the others I would have abandoned this shit a long time ago.  Tables of two go in regularly and just seated a table of 5 that have not been here as long.  I wish I could scream like Gordon does."}
{"text":"The burgers are very good and well seasoned. The onion rings were great. Just a little bit too greasy but worth a try. We went at 10 pm and there was about a 30 min. wait to get in. Service was good and the food came out in about 20 minutes. I feel it is a must try when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lots of pretentious (yes, I said it) menu items and the burgers are really rich.  I had the blue cheese burger and the flavor blend was awesome - blue cheese, manchego, arugula, figgy jam, cider vinegar reduction and spicy mayo.  If I was hungrier I would have tried the giant cone of onion rings or the kettle chip nachos with corned beef, short rib and English cheddar sauce.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the somewhat distracted service - don't rush me to order and then ignore me."}
{"text":"Love the burgers, the fries and the onion rings. But I was sad that they took my favorite hot dog off the menu. It was crazy delicious. The only other hot dog they have had a cheese sauce and I would NEVER eat a hot dog with cheese sauce but then, I don't eat movie theater nachos either. My burger was juicy but a tad over cooked. She said medium would have some pink but it did not. It was still quite good. Service was extremely slow however so be prepared to wait . We were near the pass and food did sit quite a while before runners showed up. I found that surprising. The manager was also running food which I like so they must have had some people call in sick! The line to get in was only about 15 minutes so that was good. Please put my spicy hot dog back on the menu!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience! The line  had about 35 people and we waited about 20 minutes to get seated!  Hostess was extremely friendly and the service superb!  We got the Hell's Kitchen burger, sweet potato fries and the fire wings!  All was good but the wings were amazing.  Best I ever had! Josh S the server was very laid back.  He came to us and told us that he was going on break and let us know who was going to take care of us and the latest server was as smooth! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"As many others have posted, the wait just to get a seat is long.  Once seated, service is ok, they're quick to take your order, but the wait for the food is long.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger.  The meat itself was cooked perfectly medium rare, but the toppings left something to be desired.  For something called the \"Hell's Kitchen\", I expected there to be some heat, but what I tasted was very mild, almost without any heat.  I think they need to boost up the heat factor. Fries are good, boosted by the excellent spicy ketchups they provide. Overall, everything tasted fine, but nothing special.   There are too many other burger options on the strip for me to give this a high recommendation."}
{"text":"The kettle chip nachos were simply amazing. Hog burger was solid and I recommend the Oreo shake!!!"}
{"text":"At my last day of Las vegas, I'd been GR burger. I really expected about it. I ordered 2 burgers Hell's Kitchen burger and hog burger. Hog burger is in special menu. By the way i like Hell's Kitchen burger then Hog burger. Cuz i like juicy and avocado flavor. Ps i am a big fan of GR"}
{"text":"Hells kitchen burger was really flavorful and delicious the spicy wings were also really good and the truffle French fries were great! Definitely worth the wait ."}
{"text":"Service is slow.    The hellfire wings were disappointing. It was a premium price for those wings and what we got was something not far better from Safeway instacart wings with carrot shavings and bits of blue cheese thrown on top.    For the burger, I ordered the special which had a teeny tiny bit of rib meat thrown on top of the patty. Patty was a nice thickness, but the diameter was terribly disappointing.  Cabbage slaw in the burger was typical and nothing special.   This will be the last time I eat on the strip"}
{"text":"I've been to this amazing restaurant the last time when I visited Vegas and I was looking forward to the visit this time again! My burger was juicy and tasty, however, the server we had had an attitude. Her service made our experience this time pretty awful. I wouldn't consider to come back the next time when I'm in Vegas again!!! My friend and I didn't have a pleasant visit!"}
{"text":"i'm not that much of a burger junkie, but i really enjoyed my farm burger here! the patty was a blend of chuck, brisket and short rib, topped with strips of fatty duck bacon. the fried egg sat on top of a melted slice of sharp cheddar cheese, which somehow helped cut the greasiness of everything that was going on in this burger.  however, it took a freakin' long time for the food to come out. this place will teach you what being hangry is."}
{"text":"The wait for a table was over an hour for dinner but it was worth the wait. I shared the farmhouse burger, an alcoholic beverage with blueberries (sorry can't remember the name of the drink), truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and hot dog. All I have to say is the service and food were awesome. The servers were very attentive and fast. The quality of the ingredients used to make the burger was unbelievable. I love how balance the flavors were and how it was not over seasoned. The burger meat had a nice crest on the outside and cooked all the way through but the patty was still very juicy. The fries were great. There was nothing special about the hot dog but I had to try it since we're already there. I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu. I almost forgot, the drink I had was awesome. It was very light and refreshing. I would order it again."}
{"text":"While in Vegas I popped into Gordon Ramsey Burger for a quick lunch. I was greeted with a smile and seated at the chef bar so I could watch the show. My waiter greeted me and was so comfortable to talk with. When asked what I was interested in I gave him the ahi tuna sliders the UK burger or chicken saltimbocca sliders. I then asked what he thought was the best burger.  TURDUCKEN BURGER it was.  Watching the kitchen prepare delicious plates was amazing. Everything coming out of that kitchen was picture perfect. Amazing Show. The sous chef ran the pass and was in complete control of everything that was presented.  Now to the burger.  With the first cut the perfectly runny yolk ran down the burger.  The mix of flavors with the turkey chopped burger with duck confit was amazing.  The bun was grilled to perfection. Service was wonderful and I normally do not finish an entire burger.... this one was finished. Gotta love Vegas. Gordon Ramsey did not disappoint."}
{"text":"First place we stopped while visiting Las Vegas, it was a great choice! We had the kettle chip nachos and a Hell's Kitchen burger. Everything from the service to the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Soooo tasty, juicy, and full of flavor! I got the Farmhouse Burger - that comes with the fried egg & I have no regrets ! Like everyone else said, the Truffle fries & Onion rings were fire.   Pro tip: If you have a platinum card present it up front, our wait went from 1hr to 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try his burger since it's Gordon Ramsay. We decided to split on the Hell's Kitchen Burger and regular fries. The burger is smaller than the average American burgers, but the fries were just perfect to split with another. When we bit into our burger, the bun and the meat was just perfect! The crunchiness and buttery bun was delicious from every bite. The flavor of the burger meat was cooked perfectly!! We'll definitely go back to try other burgers!    Total: $35 for 1 burger, 1 regular fries, and 1 beer"}
{"text":"Been trying to come here my last few Vegas trips and the wait is always pretty long. 1hr plus! I like the casino Planet Hollywood so the wait wasn't bad.   The burger is actually really good and fairly priced at about $15-$20 (Vegas prices of course). The quality and flavor of the patty was good and cooked just how I asked Medium Rare."}
{"text":"I know I have written a review of this place before because we eat there each trip.  I think it used to be Gordon Ramsay \"burgR\", with no \"E\"????  (This is driving me nuts, I know it used to have no E!).  We look forward to this and make this place a stop each time in Vegas. The burgers really are that good.  The wait this time was ridiculous, over 2 hours at some times!  Luckily on Friday at about 6pm the line was only 30 minutes so we again got our burger groove on.  Our server (can't remember his name) but he was spot on, super friendly and helpful and very attentive.  It's hard to have this type of attitude when a place is as busy as this place is so kudos to great service.   The only downside to this visit is that some of the past menu items are gone.  :-(   No more Euro burger, it was a favorite and the new lineup of shakes is missing some of the old and best ones!  We actually declined on getting a shake this time due to there only being 2 offered that just did not sound so great.  We never get the fries as they are really expensive and quite frankly better at any Habit Burger.  Nothing special with them at all.  Sorry Gordon, the chips just ain't happening.  I wish the server would have told me that the \"house wine\" was $14 per glass when I ordered it, I might have changed my mind as it was really nothing special.  I guess I should learn to ask first.  Burgers = A+"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, look at their giant beer list, ask if they had a pilsener and got a bit of a sneer from one of the bartenders. Ok Mr. Double-IPA, guess we haven't left 2014 yet?  In any case. Staff was a bit too casual if you ask me. One staff member loudly saying to the bartender how he lost his virginity to that song (kinda funny) but then proceeding to talk about how the other guy is going to get fired, etc.  Now to the actual burger. Got the Hell's Kitchen burger. Good combo with the jalapeno, guac, avo, but overall unimpressive. Slightly overcooked patty, but more troubling was that it wasn't exactly a great patty.   More troubling is the fact that the extra Truffle Fries I ordered (yes, Fries cost extra)... were actually Chips (the English kind, not the Lays/Pringles kind) instead of fries. Now since most Americans restaurants serve fries for their \"Fish & Chips\" instead of Chips, I'll give him a pass on this one, but seriously he should know better.  Then again he's probably re-using them on his Fish & Chips joint few blocks down the road.  Overall, not sure what I was thinking having a Brit make me a burger :)"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Order everything at one time to spare the headache. Fries came out after the burger. Bloody Mary mix was finest call, not house made, GAG. I got the lobster shrimp burger. Not good at all. I swear there was a low key Italian sausage taste in it. Hubby got the foie gras. Very good. Tasted like duck of course. I wouldn't come back here until they fix their service. Idc how good the food is, if the service is bad, I'm out"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try one of Ramsey's restaurants and I finally had the chance coming to Vegas this week! I was originally going to get a typical beef burger BUT then I saw that there was a shrimp and lobster burger and I had to try it! It was much lighter than a burger and had such a great combination of flavors with the seafood mixed with picked carrots and cauliflowers. It was a bit pricey at $26 but I'd definitely recommend it! The truffle fries were also very delicious. Only complaint would be the service is a bit slow, it took about 30 minutes to get our food after ordering."}
{"text":"The food is great. I've been here before and loved the jalape√±o burger. If you like spice, this is a must try. However, their service is disgraceful. I really wanted my boyfriend to try this place and was disappointed when I saw a long line to get in. I was assured by the hostesses it would only be about a 30 minute wait, which not-so-quickly turned into a 45-minute wait. By this time we were only a bit more than half-way. I went to talk to them about why it was moving slower than we were told and why other parties were walking in (when there were no reservations available). I was told these were diamond players and they took priority. This would've been good info to have before we wasted 45-mins in line. We ended up leaving and going somewhere else. Terrible service Gordon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great location inside Planet Hollywood in Vegas. The ambience and decor is nice. Service is on point. I had the ahi tuna slider ($14 USD) and lobster & shrimp burger ($25 USD). It is expensive I know but I promise you, it's worth it."}
{"text":"The service is beyond amazing !! Not only is thye  service superb but the hamburgers and food quality is up too par!! I highly recommend  this place."}
{"text":"The burger was everything what i imagined and more... I wish i lived in vegas to hace this on the regular and prices were surprisingly very reasonable"}
{"text":"The food was prepared well and presented well, but for some reason everything tasted sweet to me. I'm a low sugar consumption person, so I'm very sensitive to anything sweet: even the the truffle fries tasted sweet. I prefer Umami burger."}
{"text":"The Oreo shake was the best I've ever had. Get that. Burger was pretty good, but I'm not sure it's worth the big price tag. Chicken wings were also amazing."}
{"text":"As someone who's tried Shake Shack, In N Out, other family/private owned burger joints and restaurants, hands down I can say Ramsay burger is definitely worth trying more so than Shake Shack.  My breakdown for the 5 star and the suggestion to get it over Shake Shack is as follows:  Service (4.5) Its a dine in with server style so of course you dont have to self serve like you would at Shake Shack. The server I had was pretty friendly and attentive during the whole time.   Drinks (4.5) While Shake Shack does serve beer, Ramsay Burger has a lot more options and varieties including cock tails and wines. I tried their Irish Mule which was apparently the most popular drink on the cock tails selection. It was as how the server described it, not too sweet but not too overwhelmingly strong. I believe she told me it was composed of jameson, some beer, probably syrup and lime.   Burger (4.5) I tried the Hell's Kitchen which seemed to be composed of provolone, patty, avocado, jalapeno and tomato. Yes the burger was on the pricey side of $15 without fries but shake Shacks burgers all average around $9-11 as well. For the quality of the beef patty and the structure of the burger, I d say this was worth it.   Fries (4.5) Ordered the parmesan truffle fries which came with two sauce. One reminded me of honey mustard flavor and the other close to marinara sauce like taste. But it was surprisingly very good as the parmesan grits and the fries texture blended very well together. It was around $9-10 which once again like the burger, is on the pricey side but its big enough to share between two people. So its not a bad deal at the end of it.   Overall, my friend and I were both pleased with Ramsays burger and did not regret not going to Shake Shack."}
{"text":"You would think that a 5 Star chef such as Gordon Ramsay would give people organic quality food in this day and age, but it appears he is just another sold out PharmaWhore! I guess if you don't sell out then you will never become as famous!  The waiting line is about an hour to be seated and if you are a vegetarian, there is a choice of a portobello sandwich on the menu, but you are gonna pay for it at ($17)!  I have heard rumors that Gordon despises vegetarians, so this just confirms it for me!  He permits you to come to his restaurant but you will pay 2 more dollars for that non-meat sandwich!   It took about 30 minutes for our food to be served.  My partner got the the burger. It was too salty and the tomato had not been cut properly because it had the brown end still on one of the pieces. What Gordon, you allow that?  The plain french fries ($8) were fresh cut and fine, but a bit stale/cold when we got them to our table. They do not come with the burgers, so you would need to order them separately. The positive thing is they are a large portion that can be shared between 2 people.  Overall, it was not a great meal and we will not be back. We were expecting much more from you Gordon.   As Donald would say, \"You're fired!!!\" Otherwise Gordon, best get your butt back into that kitchen to check!  Update: When I got home I got horribly ill and was up all night. I am allergic to canola oil and cannot stomach GMOS, so I suspect that they are using canola oil and/other GMOs in this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were ecstatic to find this little gem in Vegas (located inside the mall- in casino- within Planet Hollywood). It can be quite the walk if you don't know where you're going.   However, although is says the environment is good for children, there is smoking galore, and the restaurant is open to it.   We had about a fifteen minute wait, and the hostess told us it would be another five minutes or so, if we could just wait back within the roped-in line we had just come from. Sure, no problem.   There were already people who gathered in that line, and because we had begun there, we simply stepped three feet to the side, so we weren't on top of anyone.   Because we weren't specifically in the square foot she was referring to, she took a customer who was behind us in line first.  She called us again to the counter in five minutes and said, \"the line is over there,\" again pointing to the line directly next to us.   We politely explained to her: \"We began there, and waited, and the line filled up, so we just stepped off to the side to wait.\"  She stared at me with a dumbfounded glare, and shook her head.   \"Um the line is there,\" shaking her head at us.  Well, it's not necessarily my favorite thing to be made to feel stupid from something so minute, when I'm first trying out such a popular restaurant.   The server who took us to our table was amazing, respectful, and kind. Although I was excited to experience the Gordon Ramsey atmosphere, the noise level was so high, we had to get our food to go.   We ate quietly in our car, and the food was amazing, unique, and delicious."}
{"text":"The name Gordon Ramsay doesn't add up to the burger. The bread and the meat were not better than Shake Shack. Dissapointed and overrated"}
{"text":"Really good food but the front service wasn't as expected. We were a group of 4 and made us wait until our group was complete to be seated but they gave a table to a group of 6 that was after us and was incomplete too."}
{"text":"Always loved this place, great food and atmosphere although noisier than many places. The food here is affordable and exotic while being normal all at the same time.  Higher recommend the farm house burger, the truffle fries and there shakes although if have a shake you may not be able to finish your burger.  Must eat place if coming to Vegas"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, but disappointed my burger was overlooked twice! A little on the pricey side, but maybe cheap for Vegas? I got the Gordon Ramsay burger, even over cooked it was still delicious. The sweet potato fries were the same as anywhere else, there's plenty to share in one order! I didn't care for the sauce that comes with it but the ketchup was good."}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch because anytime is a good time for a burger. It was a our last day in Vegas after a long weekend we decided to give this place a go. With so many good reviews and being the burger lover that I am this place was on our list for Vegas Dinning. Being as we got here early we didnt wait too long to be seated. maybe 20 mins for a party of two. We sat ordered and our burger came about 30 minutes later. Sure this is a long time to wait for a burger but it was worth it. We both ordered the Hells kitchen  burger and my partner added a fried egg which he really enjoyed. Over all good experience only wish they offered regular ketchup as im not a huge fan of homemade ketchup concoctions. Try it, but dont come when your already starving.  Burger average 15.00 Fries 11.00"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! However,  the service was terrible! Waited forever for refills, messed the order up and waitors and waitresses were more interested in chatting amongst each other at the POS machine while on cell phones. After we were done eating, waited 10 minutes for check. Very disappointing... Oh, and red headed waitress was talking very loudly at POS machine dropping F Bombs about EDC event. My 11 year old son found it amusing. Very unprofessional! Not what I expected from a restaurant with Ramsey on it..."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food is good. The problem with Burger is that the service is sooooo bad and everything is so expensive. I understand Vegas isn't cheap but for what Burger is, it's a little expensive for how terrible the service is. After eating here twice, idk that we'll come back.  Explanation of bad service - The waitress we had was not a native English speaker and was very very difficult to understand. She also could not answer questions about the menu and told us she needed someone else to help. It slowed the whole meal down significantly. Once we had ordered she brought the food out, and it was not as it was explained on the menu, or by her, or by the server who helped explain it. Idk if it was a language barrier/miscommunication issue but I would like to be able to expect that I get what I ordered and not something else."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. Was in Vegas a few weeks ago and while I was there, could not resist returning over and over again."}
{"text":"Saw all the reviews and was really excited to try this place. (Also fans of the show Hell's Kitchen). Found a hair in my food and the only reason I'm giving a 2 is because the manager comped the food. Ordered the onion rings, fries, the farmhouse burger, and the hell burger. The hair either came from the fries or the hell kitchen burger. Immediately lost my appetite and didn't want a new one. The Mrs lost her appetite too and we left Vegas disappointed as this was our last meal in town. #Disappointed"}
{"text":"The line wasn't terrible and seemed to be moving so we hopped in to get  a taste of the Ramsay Burger.  The line DID move fast indeed, however once seated we were ready to order as we spent enough time in line reading the menu and so we ordered right away.  The basic burger for the wife and the crab and lobster for me, with parmesan truffle fries to share.  We waited, oh, AN HOUR to get hour food.  Seriously.  And we were not the exception - everywhere you looked in the restaurant everyone was getting antsy and asking around for their food, and the waitstaff were tactful in avoiding us.  I could just hear Gordon in my head screaming at the staff had he been there.  We were borderline walking out when it finally arrived.  The food was pretty amazing I will admit.  I didn't care for curry ketchup, regular would have done fine, but the burgers and fries the flavor was amazing.  Just wish I didn't have to scarf it down to make it to my next scheduled item."}
{"text":"Good food and service, not too long a wait considering the location.  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, awesome patty, full of flavor and not dry. The problem came in the form of a 1/4 of an avocado that was not sliced and just plopped atop the burger. My wife had the back yard burger with slices of tomato over 3/4\" thick. Service and food otherwise were great."}
{"text":"We recently stayed at the Planet Hollywood, and ended up eating at Gordon Ramsay Burger twice. We all enjoyed our meals, and service was excellent (although it did take a bit longer to get our food on our second visit). The burgers were cooked just right, and the onion rings are so delicious! We will definitely eat here again next time we're in Vegas. A bit pricey, but everything on the Strip is expensive."}
{"text":"My first stop every time my fiance and I go to Vegas. The burgers are outstanding and the truffle fries are delicious. However, I was very upset to find out that they got rid of the jalepeno poppers. I understand menus change and it has been the same for many years but those were some of the best poppers I ever had. We literally crave them all the time and get so excited to come to Vegas to order them as our app! Please bring these back!!!"}
{"text":"Pricy but different kind of pub fare. The burger is a bit small.  The shake wasn't bad, but the only thing worth ordering is those duck fat fries. Sooooo good."}
{"text":"We have when past this location a few times and there was always a line. Especially with the name of Gordon Ramsay and being impressed with his Pub location in Casaers, we decided to check this place out.   At 3pm, there was a decent line outside the location. I thought it was kinda odd since we eat early to avoid the lines but maybe that is a good sign. Finally, we made our way to the front and the location was not filled to capacity. Why we waited, I have no idea but will learn why later as dinner progressed.   Our server was very friendly so that is a huge positive. She took the time to explain a few things and was very bubbly. There was probably the only biggest positive there.   My girlfriend ordered a cocktail and I ordered a creme brulee milkshake. They both were amazing. And we ordered the duck poutine. The fries took about 20 minutes and they were fairly good. It came with duck bacon, the sauce had good flavor and depth. But the fries had a little grittiness to it. I dont think they washed the potatoes because it was almost like a small grains of sand. Very disappointed in that. As someone who once worked in fine dining... how could you miss an important step like that?  After an hour upon sitting down, our burgers did not arrive. We were finished with the fries (which I hoped would be enjoyed with the burger but as I slowly ate it... it was finished a long time ago) and we sat there talking and waiting. You look around and everyone has the same sad face of \"Where is my food?????\"  Finally, after over one hour..the food finally arrived. By now, my food has expanded so I am not that hungry anymore. My girlfriend ordered the Hog burger which came like 1 foot tall. I remember a clip of this shows of \"How do I even eat this burger? Its so damn bloody big\". Well, he probably didnt say that word from word but close enough. We wondered the same thing. You couldnt smash it down but you couldnt eat it like a normal burger. The Hog burger was mangalitsa pork, mangalitsa bacon, bbq pork, white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion, and slaw.  I ordered the \"Foie\" Burger which had pate foie gras (spread), ch√®vre, port wine a√Øoli, frisee. It had a decent foie spread but at the same time, it was a little tangy from the aoili. It was slighty more on the tangy side so it could put down some people who dont like that flavor contrast. Luckily, my burger was manageable and it really did come out medium rare like I requested. At least they did something right.   Overall, the server was great, the food was decent and the wait was horrible. I do not think I would return to this location when I am back in Vegas. Instead, I may check out his Steakhouse or go back to the Pub location."}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals while in Vegas. True to Gordon Ramsay everything was cooked fresh.  We had a Farmhouse Burger and an Ahi Tuna burger along with the truffle fries.  Delicious, delicious and delicious. Could not imagine anything more delicious until dessert arrived.  Do not visit this restaurant without trying the Brown Butter Pecan Caramel shake. It's Ramsay's signature dessert and yes, it is life changing.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Over a half an hour long line while you stand and look at half empty tables. Once the order was placed it was almost an hour to get the $17 burger that o asked for medium rare only to get a well done dried out burger. Never again. Even Gordon Ramsay should know you don't cook a burger to death. Maybe he should focus some of his yelling at these cooks."}
{"text":"This one was a bit disappointing. Everything was hot and fresh, I think it was just the selection I made. I had the Pork Chop and Applesauce burger. I know what your thinking, but no it didn't have actual apple sauce on it. It was cabbage-apple slaw. The patty just didn't have a lot of flavor to me. Fries were really good and not, but I just wasn't impressed with the burger. Others in my group had some phenomenal looking burgers which is why I still give 4 stars. Don't believe in knocking a decent restaurant just because my taste buds didn't like what my brain wanted to try."}
{"text":"I had the soup and a burger.  They were both good and seasoned perfectly. This is an above average burger( I have had one better in Vegas) and I would recommend this place to anyone who is a burger fan."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and I can see his influence in the flavors and different variations of food here!  We had the Hell's Kitchen burger, nachos and sweet potato fries.  The burger was loaded with avocado and the burger was juicy!  The sweet potato fries are dusted with powder sugar which was interesting but the taste exploded in my mouth!!!  The different sweet and savory sauces were on point.  The manager talked story with us and the staff was friendly. We did have to wait awhile for our food but it was so tasty!"}
{"text":"so this restaurant was on my to-do list since it opened. i finally had the honor to eat here (huge gordon ramsay fan) so let me detail was wonderful experience here...  we got in line at around 8. there is two lines for big parties and smaller parties. i believe if you are more than 4 then you go into a separate line. the bigger line seemed to go faster just because there were so many small parties of 2 and 4 that they had to wait for other tables to finish first. we waited about 30 min which is not bad at all.  once we got in it was so classy so you def pay for what you get! we got a booth table and wow the set up was beautiful and they even give you menus with his face on it and you get to keep it as a souvenir!! which i def did!!  even as you sit and wait for your food they come over and snap some pictures for you to possibly purchase.  the wait was a little long but they let us know just because they do make the burgers from scratch. they did bring our fries out earlier - i just wish the burgers were a little faster so i could eat it with the fries.   so to the most important thing: THE FOOD!!!  -just fries ($8) - literally just fries; not amazing but they were thick cut and the sauces weren't anything special. -truffle parmesan fries ($11) - just get the regular fries. again, fries were nothing special. -farmhouse burger ($15) - THE REASON FOR THE 5 STARS. THE BURGER WAS AMAZING. highly recommend and all my friends were happy with their other burger choices.  OVERALL: i would come again but JUST order a burger and no fries. id love to come back and tries the other sides. trust, the burger is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Situated at Planet Hollywood the place is always packed! Got seated 5 mins before closinG since i had to line up for 30 mins.   Good beer selection from crafts to classics. I opted for a hoppie beer 9.% but it didnt seem that strong so i wonder if got the right one. The hops were nothing out of the ordinary for IPAs   Had the farmers burger and hells kitchen burger both were really good. The hells kitchen burger has jalapeno aioli and roasted jalapeno, fresh avocado which complimented the burger alot, and some good cheese. That burger was a killer. The farmers burger was good too, with an over easy egg and duck bacon, which tasted like regular bacon to me.   Service was weak, since i guess its closing time."}
{"text":"Came here Thursday evening at 8pm and the wait to get a table was about an hour. We got a table around 9. The line moved depressingly slow -- mostly due to the fact that they gave priority for reward card holders.   We ordered onion rings ($9), Hell's Kitchen burger ($15) and the UK burger ($15), and a beer ($8). The onion rings came out pretty good, and fast, though $9 is overpriced for onion slices and batter. Both the UK and the Hell's Kitchen burger were decadent and pretty tasty but I was a bit disappointed, I guess I expected more, like more complex flavors. Also, a few bites into the Hell's Kitchen burger, I realized that the avocado was missing. We were sitting at the counter top, so I called the nearest waitress over and told her about the missing ingredient. Without saying anything she went over to the set up table and handed me a small ramekin with a small avocado sliced, said maybe a curt sorry, and hurried away. Even our waitress took a good 10-15 minutes to get us our check after we finished. They all seem so busy that, other than the water boy that came over frequently to refill out glasses, I don't feel like we've been given enough attention."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay needs to go into this kitchen,  his own, and start screaming and cursing out the chefs.   My 3 cheese burger was ordered rare, and came out medium to well.   Overcooked, dry, flavorless.   Cooking hamburger meat is easy, so there's no excuse for this!   Mr B got the Hell's Kitchen burger with jalape√±o,  avocado,  dried tomato.   It had a good amount of heat and was pretty tasty.   Way better than that sad excuse for a burger I had.   There's a line to get into the restaurant, but it moved quickly.   The wait for the food was approximately half an hour!   Gordon ramsay should be screaming and cursing about that too!"}
{"text":"As a Vegas local, I usually try to avoid restaurants, especially chains, located on the strip since they're always so overpriced and are catered more towards tourists. But I had family visiting & we were already in the area, so we gave this place a try.... I was BLOWN AWAY. We got the onion rings and gooey fries as appetizers. I am not a fan of onions in any way, shape or form, but these onion rings were BOMB. The truffle Parmesan fries, tho it sounds about pricy at $12, came in a huge serving size and were also terrific. And finally.. I got the tandoori chicken burger. This was probably one of the best chicken burgers I've had in my life (and I've had a lot b/c I'm not a big red meat fan).  Other than the fantastic food, the customer service was on point even on a busy weekend night. We actually had a 1hr wait to get seated, but we didn't mind it since there were lots to do around & we were notified when it was our turn. I would absolutely come back here again."}
{"text":"Was really curious as to what Gordon Ramsay's restaurant can deliver when I happened to be in Las Vegas. I think it is really great that larger parties are able to put their name down and get a text message to come back when a table is available. Although the servers are very nice, the service was so slow. My water was never refilled and the food took over 30 minutes to come out. It was not even that busy but it seems that multitasking is something that the workers were lacking in. The food was good, a tad dry, but still tasted very good. 4 star for food. 3 for service."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best hamburger I've ever had so thick so juicy so tasty as you can tell by the photos it was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Celebrity Chef's restaurant, did not disappoint.  It was packed when we got to put our name down.  There was a line just for putting your name down.  The menu was simple and being a fan of Gordon Ramsey's food shows, I was expected to be wowed. We had 7 people and a hungry appetite.  We ordered almost every appetizers and each of them was delicious.  My favorite was the truffle Parmesan fries (still thinking about them).  The burger was well made and very juicy.  Would have been a good idea if I had shared mine cause I wasn't able to finish (especially with all the appetizers we ordered)  Service was good. We were able to enjoy the meal before heading home.  Would recommend! Get in line folks! I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Writing this review remembering that I'm reviewing a restaurant located in a very touristy Planet Hollywood Hotel in Vegas.   Pros: High-quality burgers, fries were amazing Cons: ridiculous wait time, pretty expensive  The wait is crazy. If you are not a Total Rewards member, it may not be worth it because depending on the day, you might have to wait up to two hours to get a table. When seated, the service does move pretty quickly. Our waiter was very nice even though he was handling like dozens of people.   At our table, we had the Hell's Kitchen burger, Portabella burger, and Backyard burger, and the Truffle Parmesan fries. All of the food was awesome. It's pretty pricey, and may not be worth it for some which is completely understandable. I don't think Burger is one of those \"must go to\" places in LV, but the food is still really good. Overall, I don't know if the food quality justifies the wait and the price but that's just personal preference!"}
{"text":"This may have been the best burger I've ever experienced. Definitely top 5. Had the Forrest burger and truffle fries and ever bite was a treat. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"S-L-O-W. Took 15 minutes (maybe more) for a server to even say \"hi\" to us after being seated. No drink menu - server gives you an iPad and then stares you down to make a decision quickly. Servers all advise 45 minutes for a burger - they advised it was because burgers are \"made to order\" (hmm, I cook burgers for 10 minutes at home.) Ordered 1 burger, truffle fries, hummus and 2 drinks = $70 + tip Food was good but experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"If you're in line waiting to get in or debating whether to get in line, don't!!!!!  You will end up walking out wondering why you did that.  One of the worst burger and fries I've ever had.  Simple order, a cheeseburger no bun with a side of avocado and a fried egg, that's it!   I got a piece of meat that tasted like it came from Safeway, a soft boiled egg not even on the burger, and I kid you not a sliver of avocado.  Server agreed it was ridiculous and did the right thing.  Go Elsewhere, hek even the salad at the hotel cafe had 2 pieces of avocado!"}
{"text":"Amazing place but Limited options for vegetarians, coupled with $25 burgers and long waits. Good for one-time try."}
{"text":"My second time coming here and noticed that they changed it up a bit. Food is great. I would come here again next time i'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great burgers, meh on everything else. For real.   No reservations, so come early and expect to wait a while. I went at 10:30pm and we waited in line for about 30 minutes. I saw lines forming in the morning to eat there at 11am.   I had the Hells Kitchen Burger, and it was damn tasty! Burger was cooked to a perfect medium as I asked, I loved the kick to the burger and the sesame seed bun was nice.   I also tried the truffle fries. They were good, but if you've had truffle fries before, this isn't any different.  The disappointment of the place was the drum menu and cocktail program. All of the cocktails sounded too sweet or too nasty. So many cheap beers too. Even our server commented that the cocktails were \"shitty\" and I didn't disagree with him based on the two I tried.   I actually recommend this as a place to snack. Get the burger, skip everything else, and eat a meal a couple hours later."}
{"text":"We ordered onion rings to start the meal, which came out cold. I could see them staging the fries and onion rings in the window under a heat lamp. The dipping sauces were good and the presentation was nice! The burgers were fantastic - Hell's Burger and the Blue Cheese Burger. Server was a little over the top with his personality. He thought he was much better than what he was."}
{"text":"Well the wait is long....no different than anything good in Las Vegas...  Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome. They changed the menu. Sticky toffee pudding pops are gone...that's a super bummer for us. The stars are because our food (we shared a burger and poutine) took 30-40 mins to come lukewarm to us. We ate most of it because we were hungry and didn't want to ask for a refire, only to wait again. It's not worth waiting 45mins-1hr for a table to get cold food. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Serious the Foie burger is worthy of killing someone for... it's sooooo good I love it. The Oreo shake with creme br√ªl√©e is also good"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. I had the Hells Kitchen Burger per the servers recommendation and it was bomb.com! I added an egg which was over cooked, I asked for over medium and for the egg to be runny. That was a #fail but the burger was so good that I didn't even care! LOL Also give the burger a solid 25 minutes to cook, I never knew a burger could/would take that long LOL The truffle fries I didn't care for because they were too thick and heavy for my tasted but we got them because they were also highly recommended. My sister loved them. They were just too thick and rich for my taste buds. His ranch and ketchup were so good! If you like a spicy burger full of flavor this is it! I did eat the WHOLE THING in ONE SITTING LOL"}
{"text":"Very Good Burger!!! We had a bit of a wait, that was expected but the line moves really fast.  We ordered the Kettle Chip Nachos for an appetizer, very good. The Nachos come with shredded corned beef and short rib meat which is the star of the dish.   We ordered a the special of the day, The F Burger. This ranks up there with one of the best burgers I've ever eaten and the burger patty is the best I've tasted.  It was like eating a perfectly tender piece of steak.   The only reason for the four stars is the cost ratio.  Overall, this is a great place to eat, in a great environment."}
{"text":"Just pay for a crappy service.. it's took forever for the food to come in and ruined my friend s birthday .."}
{"text":"I'm not huge on burgers, but the Hell's Burger was pretty darn good! It had a nice spicy kick from the jalapenos. We also ordered onion rings and truffle fries to share, and each appetizer came with 2 sides of sauce. Within my table, everyone ordered a different burger. I had the Hell's Burger, and the others had U.K Burger, Backyard Burger, and Forest burger.   My brother was very disappointed with this place because he ordered a medium rare, Forest burger, and his meat came out almost well done. Everyone else ordered their patties to be medium and ours came out almost well done too, but I was okay with it. I would probably give this place a 3.5 stars if possible, but I still enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! Totally worth the wait! (Though the wait wasn't even that long). My husband and I sat at the counter in front of the kitchen (where most people seemed to not want to sit) but I really enjoyed it! It was interesting to see how it all worked back there. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, it was sooooo tasty! So much flavor, cooked just perfect! Definitely one of the BEST burgers I've ever had. I also ordered their speciality cocktail which was a cinnamon pear sangria, I wish I could order this drink everywhere! It tasted amazing. All in all a great experience here! Definitely planning to come back! Tip: unfortunately, you cannot make reservations here so make sure you give yourself plenty of time to wait for a table."}
{"text":"For me this is a hype place. Maybe I'm boring, but I don't care if my burger has all the fancy weird toppings that I don't recognize. Because I hadn't brushed up on my 50 types of cheese I ended up ordering one that had what tasted like a goat cheese on it. Really disappointing since I am not into it at all. I would have asked our waitress what some of the items were but to be honest she seemed less than thrilled to be there and did not make me feel comfortable enough to ask her to explain the items. Not to mention we had to keep asking for our drinks to be refilled, and flag her down to get our bill after we sat there not eating for a good 10-15 minutes. Drink refilling is admittedly one of my nerves because that is serving/waiting 101. I know there are other better waitresses there as one next to us seemed really helpful and eager to assist her table.   We came without a reservation and waited maybe 5 minutes, not bad at all.   This is a wonderful place for someone who is more cultured in their cheeses, odd vegetables, and duck bacon... my boyfriend liked it, me not so much.   Got points for 1. Convenience to the strip 2. Fairly priced for a gourmet burger 3. Awesome truffle fries."}
{"text":"We come to Vegas once a year. Every time we do we have to go to Gordon Ramsey Burger. It's our third time here and it's been remodeled since our last time it was Gordon Ramsay  BurGR. The burgers are still great which keeps us coming back every year. I had ordered the  farmhouse burger medium which comes with an egg, bacon and cheese. It was cooked to perfection. We also had the onion rings they are beer battered thick cut and come with two dipping sauces one chedder ranch the other chipotle ketchup it's enough to share.  Our previous visits we have had the truffle fries and they are great also. One other great thing is they accept total rewards comps. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Ate here during our latest venture to Vegas.  Had the Bleu Cheeseburger which was really good.  The beef was delicious and the flavors of the bleu cheese, arugula, and spicy mayo complimented it overall.  Only complaint was that it was a tad salty.  Truffle fries were legit.  Service was top notch, our glasses were never empty, but man our food took so long to arrive, it wasn't our table either.  If it wasn't for that, I'd give it four-stars.  If you're looking for a good burger on the Strip, check this spot out.  #GordonDontPlay"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here. Got the onion rings again because they are that good. Not to heavy of an onion taste but crispy and goes well with the homemade ketchup. Tried the Fish and shrimp burger. Pretty good. I say that because there was a sweetness to it that I'm not fond of. But great taste of fish and shrimp. The shrimp and fish were ground into a patty which worked well. Overall the atmosphere was buzzing and the staff was friendly. I enjoyed my meal once again and would recommend this place to anyone that would like a good burger"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay is my idol and his creations are perfection. I love the truffle fries and I got the house burger. Both items were perfect, the first bite got my mouth dancing! The environment was really cool too!"}
{"text":"Always wanting to try one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurant and having to be in Vegas me and my husband tried this one.   It was a little less than what we expected!!   We ordered hellfire chicken wings, hell's kitchen burger (most popular one as per our server) and truffle fries. Wings were amazing with lot of flavor, great balance of sweet and spicy and juicy. The burger was ok, juicy meat but lacking flavors and the bun/bread was ok too. I have had better burgers than this. The fries were ok.   Also there was waiting of approx 20min which was not too bad and servers were nice.   Overall I liked it and would wanna go to have wings again and may be try other things on menu when in Vegas but not for hells kitchen burger ;)"}
{"text":"I love Gordon Ramsay, so I just had to eat at one of his restaurants while I was in town! There was a line of people waiting to be seated. NOTE: only parties of 2 or less wait in the line. Parties of 3 or more need to put their name on a list and they will contact you via text when your table is ready.   The wait was estimated to be an hour long. When we were notified that our table was ready, we were about a 7 min walk away (waiting for our drinks lol). We called them to let them know and they held our table for us! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and onion rings. Everything was pretty good -- a bit on the pricey side, but that was already expected. I had some of friends' truffle parmesan fries and they were okay. I don't think they were worth $11, and I preferred the onion rings over the fries.   Service was okay. Our waitress was hard to locate at times when we needed something, but it wasn't anything to get upset about. Would I come back? Yeah, but I would consider other options first. Next time, I'm coming for your steakhouse, Gordon Ramsay! ;)"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. You are just paying for the name. I'd rather have Red Robin. It's one step above McDonald's.   Waited 2hrs.   Backyard burger ordered it medium, got it over cooked to med-well. Asked to remake. Got another one back over cooked at well done ++  Gave up. They gave us credit for it.   Hell's Kitchen. Wife ordered med-well (I know, I know), got it over cooked at well done ++   Maybe ask for it rare to get it medium?  The beef size is like 1/4 or 1/3 lb. very small amount of meat compared to say John Howie or any other high end burger/steak place.   Fries were reheated what seemed like 4 times.   Ketchup was trying too hard.   Won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"The burgers were fine for the money, but not LV special. Price wasn't too bad, but the sales pitches from the staff were annoying. That would all be forgivable except for watching food dying in the window from our seats. Seriously. Fries, rings, and apps sitting in the window for 10 minutes waiting on burgers to sell while a sous chef portioned sauces. Everything went out too. I felt bad for the people eating dead food."}
{"text":"Nice setting, good service, good presentation. Went for the burger but loved the fries. I definitely recommend the sweet potato fries and the truffle parmesan fries; they are perfection, especially when dipped in their coordinated sauces. That being said, the burger was kind of a flop. I had the Forest Burger which had two of my favorite burger toppings, mushroom and bacon (although in the odd forms of forest mushrooms and duck bacon), but the tremor cheese overwhelmed the taste of everything else on the burger. The burger tasted like a meaty block of tremor cheese, with not even a hint of bacon or mushroom to it. Kind of my mistake though, I ordered the burger despite it being topped with an unfamiliar cheese, and paid the price."}
{"text":"Currently having the best burger of my life here. Blue cheese burger. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Get Hog Burger (I think this is what its called). This review is based upon several month ago. I've been here with my girlfriend. Thank god! there were no waiting in line. We were seated promptly and servers were really attentive and nice. Ordered Hog burger with Goat Cheese burger (I don't know what it is called) and onion rings. Onion rings came out first to start, and it was like heaven in my mouth with their specialty sauce on the side. Burgers were great that time. Price is reasonable too, so I would not say anything bad about this place.  But the only downside is that it usually has such a freaking long line that de-appetite you by just looking at that long line, so be aware of that. If you can handle this long line, great place to go."}
{"text":"Next time I'll try Bobby Flay's burger joint.  The service was a bunch of \"uninterested\" slogs dressed up in pretty outfits.  Unfortunately, my $20+ lamb burger was COLD and almost raw. The fries (all 14 of them) were the best part of the meal.  I wanted to say I ate at Gordon's restaurant, and I did. But the price tag was NOT worth it. I could have gone to In N Out for a REAL burger.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place recently underwent a change of ownership, which we did not know until we were seated.  NONE of the delicious burgers that were on the menu are there anymore. The burgers we did order were NOT delicious - they were AWFUL.  4 of us in the party and no one finished theirs.  We ate what we were served as it took FOREVER to get our food and we were starving.  Plus, we had to send 2 of them back to be remade as they were overcooked (we asked for medium rare, not chared) .Fortunately we are Diamond players so we did not have to wait in the 45 min to 1hour plus line, but I PITY whoever waits for this crappy food.  The cafe would have been better.  I eat burgers once a week and was looking forward to Burgrs, what a let down.  Maybe change the name to BUGGERS.    GORDON, YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR ALLOWING YOUR NAME ON THIS PLACE, BUT I GUESS THE LICENSING FEES YOU RECEIVE MORE THEN MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF FLAVOR, SERVICE ETC...  I can only hope that your star is now fading in Vegas and soon ALL of the place with YOUR NAME attached go under.  I cannot wait to see what takes the place of this joint (I cant even bring myself to call it a restaurant) - HOPEFULLY by the end of the year....or sooner.  * SHAME ON PLANET HOLLYWOOD or the F & B manager or whoever for allowing this place to remain open.  Apparently, I am in the minority as there are rave reviews here. Those who gave 4 or 5 star reviews most likely NEVER had the opportunity to eat at the original BURGR, or they would probably change their ratings."}
{"text":"I was expecting something really good....however it was just OK.  2 of us had the Hog Burger.  It was very dry. We both drank over 3 glasses of water with it.  I'd recommend trying something different...or a different place.  The Parmesan fries were really good, the sweet potato fries were not...just give those a miss.  Service was pretty quick once we got a table."}
{"text":"Debated on giving this 3 or 4 stars because it is Vegas so some expectations have to be lowered because it is a busy place where higher prices are the norm. My boyfriend loves Gordon Ramsay and we always watch his shows so we knew we had to check out this place! We went around dinner so obviously we knew it'd be a long wait. It was a 90 minute wait and I was totally willing to stand in line but the hostess took our number and told us we could walk around the hotel/casino and they'd text us when a table was ready. I looove that! We ended up going to a cool bar while we waited and then getting a text to come back, so convenient! We were seated immediately and ordered our burgers. They let us know they take a longer time because they hand make them so we were expecting a longer wait than normal but it was sooo long! Maybe it was because we were hungry but it felt about 3x as long as you'd normally wait at a steakhouse. When we got the food it was absolutely delicious!! I got the UK Burger and could only finish half of it because it was so filling and tasty! Still craving it!  I didn't care for the cocktail much but that could have just been my own tastes. It took forever to get our server's attention to ask for the bill, and then for them to finally come back with the bill. When we finally got them to take our card it took a while for them to bring it back again! This was frustrating because the entire process of waiting for food etc had already taken so long, I thought the checkout process would at least have been swifter. When they finally brought the receipts to sign I was excited-- i thought \"write a tip, sign, then finally LEAVVVE!! YES!\" But nooo... turns out the server charged BOTH bills (we had two groups) on my ONE credit card even though we had given them two cards and explained. Had to wait yet again for them to correct this and I'm still not sure if it was corrected since it was so busy and couldn't hear what was going on much. So the service was definitely not what I expected but the food was good. I think if you go when it's not so busy you would have a 5 star experience but not at prime time."}
{"text":"First of all, the line doesn't make any sense, so I advice you go to the hostess, check in, and they will text you when the table is ready. This place is definitely worth visiting. The best burger ever, and the price is decent. It doesn't come with fries, but the side order of fries is shareable. I recommend medium burger, it's juicy and soft.  The only reason I didn't give 5 starts - when we watched Master shef, Gordon Ramsay yelled at one of the contestants for making french fries that were not exactly all same shape. He said it was absolutely unprofessional. Well, you should know that in his own burger place all french fries are DIFFERENT, the most different shapes we have ever seen. I wouldn't care, but he was the one to insist on it.  Definitely check this place, enjoy your burger."}
{"text":"Solid and creative hamburgers with good service. It is always busy here. I would recommend getting any hamburger and going for lunch!"}
{"text":"How to properly write a review for a Ramsay restaurant without using the F word? ;)  I'm up to the challenge.  Of course there was a wait, and that's to be expected.  I don't necessarily think the hostesses handled this in the most efficient or friendly manner, especially for there being 4 of them.  4 employees to do one job and to do it poorly, kinda weird.      The great thing is that you forget about this pretty quickly after you sit down.  Excellent menu with thoughtful creations and options for everyone.  What I loved is that from the fries, to the onion rings, to the dipping sauces, to the burger and every component on the burger....all thoughtful.  All tasty.  This is not a place that serves Heinz with his hand battered onion rings or raw onions with their pork burger.  All components are thoughtful and delicious and that's what makes this a stand out, gotta return, Ramsay name worthy establishment.   Go!  You'll enjoy your meal here.  Trust."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place even though i heard mixed reviews.  I came on a friday night at 8 and the wait wasnt too long 25 minutes which was a surprise.  Waiter was very friendly and came multiple times to ask if we needed anything service overall was great :) im giving it three stars because i felt like the onion rings and the truffle Parmesan fries were way too salty.  The burger was ok nothing amazing overall the meal wasnt worth the price and i wouldnt come back again."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of chef Ramsay and wanted to go here when I was in Vegas. This is a great place to have a burger but there was a long wait. The time it took in line to sit at the bar was about 25 minutes. When I sat down the bartender informed me the burgers take about 20-30 minutes to come out. He was accurate but the wait was worth it.  The burger was cooked to perfection and tasted great!  I was so full from the burger I couldn't even finish the fries.  The bartenders were also very friendly and personable."}
{"text":"what's not to love here. the food is simply amazing the atmosphere is great and the staff is super friendly. i order the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was super delicious as well as the truffle fries.  the wait time for our food was just a little too long but i don't usually care for that.  great job and will be coming back to this place whenever i'm around Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Popped in for dinner for two..the wait was  about 30min...not too bad. Got seated had ro wait a little for the waiter, but from that point forward he was on.  The Burgers  My wife had the Farmhouse I think it was called. That isht was great. Cooked to perfection was the burger & over easy egg.  I had the Forest and did not like it. It had a weird taste...maybe the duck bacon? I eat duck so I assumed it would be ALL good, but not so much for me. That is not to say it wasn't cooked perfectly because it was. Just didn't like it.  I told my waiter he apologized like he was wrong and offered me another burger in it's place. Well by this time wifey is done & we have to go see the fountain show. So I decline the replacement beccause we are leaving. The waiter assured me it would be quick so of course I got the Farmhouse cause it was effin great. He did not exaggerate the burger was packed to go before my visa came back."}
{"text":"My husband had been wanting to visit this place for a long time but we never got a chance to until this trip. He was so excited since he is a huge fan of Chef Ramsey. This place does not take reservations so it's first come first serve by waiting in line. Ppl were right and you do need to get in early. For parties of 3 or more, depending if there is a wait the hostess will take your name and number to text you when your table is ready. I thought this was nice instead of waiting so we were able to go play some games, plus we were still waiting for the rest of our party to join us.   The service was great, our waitress was real attentive and she kept our drinks refilled at all times. Plus she was good about letting us know how long the food would take to set our expectations which I appreciated. We ordered the kettle chip nachos to munch on while we waited for our burgers. They were pretty good and flavorful and crunchy. For the burgers we got the Hell's Kitchen which I  thought was cooked well and I loved the peppers and aioli. We also got the Parmesan truffle fries on the side. It was enough to feed the 4 of us. All the sauce accompaniments (we also asked for ranch) seemed freshly house made and were delicious!   Overall the meal and experience was great. I would definitely recommend coming back and would probably go again if we come through Vegas again."}
{"text":"This place looks cool with the fire from outside the restaurant, but the hostesses could care less if they work and the food was disappointing. I was starving and had just landed in town so I thought just about anything would be good - but it wasn't! I had the Hell's Kitchen burger but it was so bland and had no flavor. The only flavor was from the one big jalape√±o you bit into and that was just burning your mouth. I usually love spicy and hot foods. The onion rings were decent because I liked the spicy ketchup, but the Cheddar Ale soup was yuck! Way too much chive.  The wine menu was awful and was all cheap bottom shelf stuff you get from Costco. I like trying new wines and champagne when I'm out - especially Vegas, so that also was disappointing. Definitely don't stand in line for this place. It's just hyped up because of the name behind it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere here is top notch, and you can expect a long wait if you miss the opening time. Walking in, the restaurant reminds you on multiple level that it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant (maybe to hypnotize your taste buds).   As most, this place was on our bucket list but we were half prepared that it was mostly hype. And, we were right.  Granted the meat, condiments and buns (wish it was warm but more on the cold side) were fresh. Although the burger we wanted was suppose to be medium rare, it could've use another minute on the grill.  Be forewarn that their foie gras burger is actually a \"SPREAD\", not a foie gras patty. Knowing this we still gave it a shot. Knowing it's a spread we still couldn't taste the foie gras, perhaps because the bleu cheese was too over powering. If there was a must try burger, go for the Anniversary Burger (it's not on their menu) and their Seafood burger.   As for the appetizers, the onion rings are the best of all the bunch. The wings with bleu cheese didn't work for me. The Nacho's was made with fresh chips, but for some reason the meat, sour cream and everything else didn't mesh together. The white truffle french fries was unique and worth a try if you must have french fries.  Their shakes were on the overly sweet side to the point where the kids didn't even finish half."}
{"text":"The patty is made up of riblets or something. The burger was way too salty. They have like a whole wall that is on fire so it was physically hot too. Although their shakes are good. They are made with like a parfait and taste great"}
{"text":"Other than the long wait this place was great. We went back 3 times at three different times of the day and the line was still lonngggg. Decided to come back after seeing our last show and waited 30 min to reach the front of the line. This was about 1045pm. Plan ahead if you want to eat here."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever tasted. I had the hog burger. Not a burger fan by the way, however i got dragged into this place by the best in who just had to have a burger"}
{"text":"Jessica the hostess should be fired.  She asked me for $20 tip to move my party to the front of the line.  Then when my party waited over 45 mins she handed me my $20 back and said good luck waiting an hour and a half.  Jonathan the manager was quick to take care of us with good service so thank you sir for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"Best burger place I've been too in awhile.  Second time here and it's still as amazing as the first!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is amazing. My mouth is in heaven. I had a boner when I left and there was nothing I could do. Most people just nodded and acknowledged that they also enjoyed the burgers!"}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant on Wednesday night about 10:30pm. Every table was full and there were lots of staff around - which I will address later in my review. We started with the Beer Battered onion rings. MISTAKE. They had obviously been fried earlier and the re-dipped in the fryer. They had this weird powder on them which was not Parmesano Reggiano as advertised  it was strangely reminiscent of the green can Parmesan.    Come on Gordon, that would have caused a famous f-bomb and an equally famous spit-out. Now, I know you don't oversee the day to day, but your name's on it so ya gotta own it. These things reminded me of onion rings you would get in a take out that's delivered to your house hours after they are cooked.   My husband had the Specialty fish and crisps burger... or should I say the indistinguishable protein burger drowned in a STRING dill mayo. F-bomb... spit-out.  A specialty ... wow NO.   I, on the other hand, had a perfectly cooked Hell's Kitchen Burger. It was a perfect medium cook, great bun, and just the right amount of sauce to be moist, but not like the fish thing over-sauced.   Now, the restaurant itself and the service. First we waited in line for ten minutes or so and there was this bizarre fire sculpture behind the glass. It was generating enough heat to actually cook the food there. Really!!! It was 95 degrees outside in Vegas so fake fire would have been welcomed.   The service was less than stellar as well, actually it was terrible. We had 4 or maybe 5 different people waiting on us. The guy who took the order and the check and who didn't get a great tip stood on the side and joked around with his friends the whole time. He never checked on our drinks or anything. I chalk that up to management. A well-trained  floor manager would never have let that happen.   My advice... there are lots of great restaurants in Vegas. Find one other than Gordon Ramsey  Burger."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. There was no line so we were seated right away. I have wanted to try this place for a while. My honest opinion is that yes, the burgers are good. I could taste the quality of the beef used and it was well seasoned. I had the jalape√±o burger which was not really spicy, it just had a small kick. The bun is soft and the ingredients are good quality. I did not really enjoy the sweet potato fries as I found it strange that it had powdered sugar spinkled on it. The negative really has to do with the service. The servers are not that welcoming and act like it's a fast food restaurant as opposed to a sit down. No smiles, no welcoming, no \"enjoy your meal.\" The food runner dropped off the food with a slam of the plate and didn't say a word. Also, this is a rather expensive meal for just a burger. If you are coming here, it's because of the name attached, not necessarily because of the quality of the experience or any value."}
{"text":"We must have gone at a good time, we were sat immediately. Service was good and the food was really tasty and fresh. I was really impressed that the ketchup and ranch were made fresh as well. Really good!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, friendly atmosphere, hardly no wait to get in. Would definitely go again! It was a very casual experience but also delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and great service. I highly recommend the jalapeno poppers, they leave the seeds in 1 and don't tell ya which."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian (and healthy eater foodie) and this place rocks!! Plenty of vegetarian friendly dishes! And the drinks are amazing! The fries are with the toxins in your body- they come with cool flavour ketchups. And great vibe and atmosphere.  Get on list for table and they'll text you when ready.  The line gets pretty long!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and our server was awesome.  I There isn't much to say!  Gordon Ramsay is known for keeping it simple and this restaurant delivers on a simple premise executed well with high quality ingredients.  It wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but it was definitely a five-star!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal menu knowledge by server Nadine. She recommended the Forest Burger after I explained what I liked. Needless to say it was beyond my expectations. The onion rings were breaded to perfection and the sauces were like something I've never had in my life!"}
{"text":"OMG! The Wheatberry-Quinoa Salad is the best salad I have ever eaten in my life! Perfect amount of dressing. All flavors complimented each other. Tons of greens, but they were balanced by all of the other vegetables and the delicoius grains in the salad. So I guess I\"m saying, it's a very large salad. And it was sooooo good!!! We also had the Hummus and Pitas. Yum!   My husband was in the mood for a salad and so was I. When I suggested we go to Gordon Ramsay's Burger restaurant, my husband was like, \"For a salad?!\" But he humored me.   After we finished eating, he said that his salad (we both had the same salad) was superb. He really thought a salad at a restaurant that specializes in burgers would be lacking. But he was happliy surprised to find that his salad was really good.  The only downside to this restaurant - and it's a big downside - is that they don't take reservations. So you either have to go very early and wait by the fire sign (not ideal with the Vegas heat), or eat at a time that most people won't be lined up, or just wait as long as it takes. The line was fairly short when we arrived at about 5:30pm on a Saturday night. But it still would have taken about 35 minutes to just be seated and we had a show to catch.   I asked if they could do a takeout order for us instead and they did. That saved us! It was super delicious and I'd eat here again for sure!   The staff were friendly and very helpful. Thanks for an awesome dinner!"}
{"text":"The hype is reaaaaal.  The burgers aren't bad, they are tasty, but definitely not worth the pricetag. The servers are super slow, and that's the reason they always have a long line outside. There are plenty of tables inside, they just dont turn them over efficiently. Maybe it's their plan.. trying to make it seem more busy than it is.  It is such a popular place in Vegas, because its probably the only moderately priced Gordon Ramsay restaurant in all of Vegas. Try it once, but it's really nothing too special."}
{"text":"We had Mother's Day lunch here and it was fantastic! Food and service were both outstanding."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant experience dining here. We got seated right away on a Sunday afternoon, 4:30pm, as there was no line (yet). The food service is a little on the slow side (took 15 min to bring out our appetizer and another 15-20 min to bring out our burgers) but it's due to the fact that the kitchen cooks everything to order and they take their time to ensure high quality. Plus I asked my patties to be cooked well-done which they did perfectly!  Blue burger: 5 stars! Loved the complex flavors! Hells Kitchen burger: also 5 stars, but I prefer the Blue burger more if I had to choose between the two.  Chips and curry dip: 5 stars... super fresh potato wedges, big portion, and delicious yellow curry dipping sauce.  Worth the hype but I probably won't wait in line for this. Come during the downtime!"}
{"text":"This is a great burger joint but with Gordon's name attached, I was expecting something a bit more.   We were able to get a table without reservations after a moderate wait, only 30 minutes. Which is to be expected with a place this popular.   The drink menu was creative and delivered the flavors promised  There was nothing tricky about it but in hindsight, I should have just gone with a beer.   We ordered poutine and onion rings to get things started. The onion rings were amazing. Usually onion rings go limp and soggy almost immediately but these held up.   The poutine, however, was just a mess of flavor. Poutine is simple. Fries, brown gravy, cheese curds and optional meat. This was needlessly a complicated dish that tried too hard and was a disappointment.   The burgers served up were delicious but the entire table I was with ordered them cooked the same way, medium rare, based on our servers suggestion. When they arrived, however, we had burgers that ranged from rare and almost blue to almost medium. I had one of the rarer burgers and while tasty, it just became a wet mushy mess a few bites in.   The service was great. The ambience was cool and what you would expect. It is a bit noisy and crowded but this is Vegas after all."}
{"text":"The first time I went with my group of friends there was no wait, the service was amazing, our server went above and beyond. Literally would have recommended this place to anyone because the food is just delicious! Second time around, today to be more specific, I left completely disappointed. Not disappointed with the food because it was just as delicious as the first time. Disappointed because for some reason the staff kept giving my friends and I unwarranted stares, talking about our group to other staff and looking right at us. Mind you my friends and I are far from being rowdy and obnoxious so I do not see a reason as to why the staff would act this way. We may not dress like the richest people in the world but that does mean it's okay to assume we do not have money. It made the whole second experience very uncomfortable and honestly as much as I love the food I would really think about it long and hard before stepping foot in this establishment again. Food deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"We took an Uber to specifically eat here because we were craving a good burger. we arrived at 11:30 and they close at midnight. They turned us away because \"the kitchen is having issues\" however people were still not served their food so what kind of issues would this be? I spoke to the manager who said they can't keep up with business and have long ticket times so they had to close early. What kind of restaurant of this name in Vegas understaffs their cooks and closes early?"}
{"text":"The burgers and shakes here are always dope. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger. The meat was cooked how I requested it (med-rare). The fries sauces were great. Some of my fries came out a little soggy but it's alright since it was only a couple of them, nothing I would cry about. I also ordered the Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake. I always order one to-go so I can sip on it while wandering the Strip since the drink is pretty chilled and the weather is hot. Every time I go to Vegas, I always make it a point to eat here, I never miss out on the great burger.  I am not a professional food critic or chef but I do enjoy good burgers. This is always on the top of my list as #1 burger. I highly recommend you also reserve a table in advance since it's always crowded in here. If you are coming solo, lunch time you can probably find a bar spot without reserving (up to around 2pm) but afternoon, evening, and night times require a reservation to get in quickly."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I was not a happy camper (with my spouse) once I walked into this place and looked at the menu prices. I gave her the look.  OK. To start off, my family and another family were on a Spring Break trip in Vegas (don't judge). And my wife was in charge of most of the itinerary and she chose this place I knew nothing about. I guess she seen it on TV or friends or what. Well, once I walked in and glanced at the menu, I was like this place is NOT price friendly for kids and we have 3 kids with us. Ex. The hotdog was $17 (I think). Anyways I just frowned up until the point of the food arrival.  I ended up ordering a Cheeseburger as this is what they are known for. Again, wasn't happy with the price but I went along with it as planned. This place was very elegant and well thought layout. Live fires burning all around. You could see the kitchen in a distance as food was prepared. The wait staff was exceptionally polite and friendly. We actually held a 2-3 minute conversation that was pleasant as well. We ended up changing an order after placing it and the waiter was not upset at all for changing and also offered if we don't like something to let her know and she will exchange it. So I was impressed and feeling a little more at ease about the price issue (above).   The food arrived: I left out the part that my spouse suggested we order 1 french fries for my entire family of 3. Once the waiter placed our fries on the table, I was like wow. I should have listened to her. Ending result, we left several fries uneaten and I hate to waste good french fries.   Now to the burger. The burger size was a decent size. The meat looked hot and juicy. Quality of the remaining of the burger looked great. I was impressed. Once I bit into the burger, all i could say is Hmmmmm. This is pretty good. And it was as juicy and tender as it looked. Those damn fries (sweet potato) were on fire (not literally). They were VERY delicious. I wanted to make sure I ate all of those before helping with the regular fries ordered.   Hotdog: Yes, that $17 hotdog. That thing was huge. I was thinking no way my son will be able to eat half of it. The weenie was wrapped in bacon. With that notion, I really wanted to taste it. And once I did, it was delicious. I could have ordered it for myself and been happy. My son was able to finish half of it and he enjoyed it. We were all stuffed.  I recommend this place for the food mostly, and the amazing ambience they offer. And the cleanliness and wait staff.  All of it was amazing."}
{"text":"I was thrilled with the food here! Absolutely delicious! I had the truffle fries, poutine fries, the Crown Burger, and a creme br√ªl√©e milkshake as well as a Chamborita cocktail (I shared with others. Lol) The poutine fries we're by far the best poutine I've ever had! They were devoured in almost no time. The burger was wonderful and did the namesake of the restaurant proud! It was a good size, juicy, and the flavors mixed really well with each other. The drink was delicious and strong and the truffle fries were awesome! All in all, I really enjoyed myself! The price is rather off putting, though. The burger alone was $16. That didn't include any sides. The poutine fries were $14, the truffle fries $12 (you can get regular fries for $9), and the drink was $13. The portion sizes are good, though, so you definitely won't leave hungry! Definitely recommend for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I have been waiting since one hour for my truffle fries. Also the people right next to my table with exact truffle fries order got it after ordering 15 mins after us. No waiter has checked on is since 20 mins or so.  Eventually we got served super cold fries and we weren't able to finish neither the fries nor any of our burgers as they were cold.  Felt really bad as I hear good things."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for a good burger,  I have been to all the great burger joints in Las Vegas. I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger, I ordered it medium rare and it seemed raw to me and under cooked. Maybe next time I should say medium. The patty should be bigger also, it got lost in the toppings. Where is the beef?  The truffle fries were over cooked  and all I got was little pieces not full fries.  I can't believe they serve Pepsi, everybody knows burgers are only good with a ice cold Coca Cola?  As Gordon would say that burger and fries was @ \"DONKEY\" Sorry Gordon not a happy burger consumer at your joint."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! I was so full and the fries are also amazing. The place is a little more on the casual side and overall this was a great place to have a delicious burger."}
{"text":"I love you Gordon Ramsay! You can cuss at me all you want!  I was super excited to come here when he announced after the season finale of Hell's Kitchen.  The winner, Christina Wilson, is the executive chef here!  I was mind blown on how juicy the burgers were.  I always order the Farmhouse burger and the addition to the fried egg is exquisite.  I love Truffle fries, but I was disappointed the way it was made here. They were cut in wedges so you don't get the crisp crunch and there wasn't enough truffle!  Still a fan of fries though. Fries before guys? For appetizers, we ordered the Pork Belly buns and I was amazed at how soft the buns were. Usually, some places overcook the buns so it ends up dried out.  I'm not sure if they're still serving that, but it's definitely a must have there.  If you're in Vegas, this is your one stop!"}
{"text":"Best.. meal.. of my entire.. LIFE! And I can't wait to try other G.R. Gems! I have spoiled my palate so much with this place that ordinary restaurants just cannot cut it for me. I brag all the time about this place! I don't remember what I had as far as my burger but it was very tasty especially their variety of mushrooms they add to them. The Poutine fries were amazing! What I loved is that usually you taste nothing but a mushroom after-taste with poutine but this flavor was much different! More of a freshly cracked black paper taste. Burnt ends were by far the best part. And cocktails? Definitely worth it! I can't forget the Oreo creme br√ªl√©e milkshake! I have never had anything like that in my life! By far, best tasting food."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had hands down.  Great service even though super busy.  The food was amazing and I would come back again for sure"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this restaurant and let me tell you this place never disappoints. I just love this place and the food here.  Food- Finger licking good Staff- Friendly  Service- Great Prices- Reasonable"}
{"text":"Luckily we arrived early enough on a Sunday afternoon to by pass the long line to get in to this place.  Staff was inviting, knowledgeable and friendly.  Refills came quick and upon ordering we were quickly informed we may be interested in a starter because all burgers take about 30 mins to be prepared and delivered to table. We decided on chicken wings and beer battered onion rings.  Was super excited. Expecting to be blown away, and I was thoroughly unimpressed.  The rings were made with shoe string thin onions, a lot of oil and light batter.  I literally felt like I had a cup of grease in my mouth   The wings were very meaty, but just seemed dry to me...but honestly I'm not a great wing eater, so according to husband, these were \"pretty good.\"  Burgers--Hell's Kitchen burger, the chiles add a dimension of smokiness and full round flavor.   The Hog Burger, super huge and filling.  Very delish! Forest Burger, my burger:  bacon fried in duck fat, patty, saut√©ed mushrooms, arugula and I added an egg.  Thank goodness gracious I added that egg--it added some creaminess and moisture to the burger (even though I ordered med-rare, not very juicy) that it needed desperately.  I don't know if someone over seasoned the saut√©ed mushrooms and put too much salt, or if the thick cut duck fat bacon lent a salty taste to the burger, but darn it, my blood pressure went up!  I had to pull out the bacon  And I absolutely love--LOVE arugula on a burger, but the heaviness, and maybe the creaminess of the egg in combo with the arugula just didn't work.  The arugula lent a bitter, earthly zing to the burger, and not in a good way  gosh, I'm so bummed.  First time at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and not super impressed..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I was trying to find something wrong with this restaurant. My guilty pleasure is watching Gordon's shows and I was hoping that I could catch a screw up or something but everything went without a hitch.   I recommend getting there early as we waited for about 20-25 min for a table. After being seated we were greeted by a friendly waiter whom introduced us to the concept and recommended a few items. We ultimately chose the following: - hell's kitchen burger - bleu cheese burger (pictured)  - sweet potato fries  Oh man... I am dreaming of those fries, they are amazing! Please please do yourselves a favor and go to this burger joint, you won't be disappointed.   We came in hangry and left overwhelmingly delighted. Damn you, Gordon!! Can you do anything wrong?"}
{"text":"I have to say the flavors are great. The burgers were exciting yet overpriced, but for the name, I wanted to try it. The fries we got one order to and I was disappointed with the texture and got some with pieces of potatoes that had black in them. The texture of the fries was off and seemed to be tougher as if they're had been reheated. I loved the ketchup flavors that the brought with the fries though. As far as I am concerned the place is more touristy."}
{"text":"Came in at noon on a Thursday and there was no line. The menu has no pictures and for me that's important lol. The drink menu is on a tablet that the server brings to you. Table setting is simple.  I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger and my husband had the Forest Burger along w the Truffle Parmesan Fries.   You must try the Chamborita!   Husband and I gave our burgers an 8 each. Fries are a 9/10."}
{"text":"We had the best waiter here his name is Alex. Ask for him if you can. My husband got the blue cheeseburger and I got the onion rings! I am a very picky eater so I always stick to something safe but OMG the cheeseburger was amazing and the onion rings are to die for."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had... awesome fries, and the curry ketchup is fantastic! The atmosphere is nice, but it did feel a little \"busy\" as the restaurant is very open and near the entrance of the Planet Hollywood casino. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"It's Gordon Ramsey so I figured it would be good, it exceeded my expectations. Truffle fries are a must, you won't regret it! Burger had great flavor, juicy and filling."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait; don't be intimidated by the long line. Lobster and shrimp burger was fantastic. I ordered the foie burger, I was disappointed. The burger was fine but I got only one bite of real foie gras taste. Was not worth the extra six dollars price above the regular burger. The truffle Parmesan fries were great tasting from the fries on the top of the dish. After that, they were just plain fries. Worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"My family and I went here on a whim since the reviews were so great, and my late-night binge watchings of Gordon Ramsay. So my expectations were super high. Unfortunately, our experience was terrible. Went here at 12 in the afternoon, and we had to wait 15 minutes just to be seated. We ordered the truffle fries, some Thai/curry shrimp salad, and a blue cheese burger. It took roughly an hour and 30 minutes just to receive the order. Our fries were room temperature and stale, though the truffle sauce was good. The burger wasn't charred, it was burnt. You couldn't taste the cheese or the meat whatsoever, all you could taste was the bitterness of the burnt parts. Now here's the worst part: the salad. The shrimp was the SALTIEST thing I have ever eaten. I've had plenty of curries in my life, and nothing has ever compared to the burnt, sodium-ridden shrimp that we were served here. Left with less than half the burger gone, only a few fries gone, and a plate full of salad and shrimp. Maybe we just got a bad batch of everything, who knows? Skip this place and go eat somewhere more worth your money."}
{"text":"I can say Ive \"been there and done that\" but that's  all. $85 for 2 burgers, 1 order of fries and 2 cocktails were not worth it. Ive had better burgers from \"Back Yard Burgers\" in Florida"}
{"text":"A little pricey and I think the sides are even better than the burgers.  If you're looking for a great burger there are less expensive options.  But sometimes you need a fun Gordon Ramsay experience.    Everybody who has tried the farm burger loves it.  Get the onion rings. Amazing."}
{"text":"Went here years ago and loved it. Everything was perfect and delicious so I made a point to go when I went back to town. Something changed. The truffle fries tasted stale. The burgers were acceptable, but nothing like the perfection of before. With a casual atmosphere and barely satisfactory food quality the $40/person price was not worth it. Sad and disappointing situation overall."}
{"text":"I just had the lobster burger and foodgasm.  Kettle chipped nachos. Holy heavens batman.  This place blew my mind."}
{"text":"The hamburguer is not that good... everything was salty and the waiting time to get the food is to long for a burger  I don't think that the price worth the experience"}
{"text":"Me and my bf were visiting lv and decided to eat a lunch here. We ordered a truffle parmesan fries and hell's kitchen burger and a hog burger. Both burgers were very delicious however the hog burger was exceedingly bomb ass good!!! We will definitely comeback for hog burger when we are back in town. One star is taken away because the service we got was terrible. For 20 min we didn't know who our server was because no one came to us and we couldn't flag anyone down even though it wasn't that busy. After we finally got to order the server never came to check on us and it was hard to flag anyone down for drink refills. the food was great but I was disappointed with the service"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! The burgers are juicy, I recommend getting the truffle fries and don't forget the salads! Everything on the menu is to die for.   If you're a Vegas tourist, expect a lot of walking just to find this place - deep inside the Planet Hollywood (PH) casino. I'm not a fan of PH at all. I think it's a dump - one of the dirtiest places on the Vegas strip. (No wonder it's the center for drug dealers and strip scammers.) That's the biggest disadvantage I think this wonderful burger restaurant has.   Otherwise, just make sure you arrive before 4p.m. on weekends to avoid long lines. In spite of its location, it's worth trying out at least once!"}
{"text":"I had such high expectations for this place, and they were met. Gordon Ramsay Burger served me the best burger and fries I've ever had. The wait was atrocious. We probably waited a little over an hour in line and it was by the line of fire, so it got a little warm. Other than that, everything was a dream.  We got seated and our server was very attentive. He kept making sure we didn't have any questions and was very quick. We ordered the Farmhouse burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger. Both were DELICIOUS. The farmhouse burger had a fried egg and savory thick bacon, and the Hell's kitchen had a slices of jalape√±o and jalape√±o aoli.  I highly recommend the truffle parmesan fries. They were extremely flavorful and comes with ketchup and garlic (?) dipping sauce. I dreamed about it the next day. Come try this place at least once in your life! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I came here after a long and fun night in Las Vegas.  I wanted a burger and the line wasn't bad at all at 1am.  I had the Hog Burger and it was so full of flavor. The ingredients were fresh and it's a must when coming here.  I also had the truffle fries and they were really good as well.  I'd love to come here again."}
{"text":"Great burger! A bit expensive, but worth every penny. The truffled fries are also awesome!"}
{"text":"I live here in Vegas behind the flamingo so I decided to park there for free and take a walk I ended up here. I've been to his pub at caesars and I just wanted a good burger. I sat at the bar the staff was spot on, friendly and took my order quickly, another staff member seemed like a manager was on top of everything, working the room and keeping people happy, the burger with the asiago was delicious i think it was called the hells kitchen burger I ordered med rare and got just that. I was pleased because some are to scared to keep it a little pink. They also didn't over price their burgers I had a burger an iced tea and with tip was only 23 dollars. I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Have reservation at steakhouse so just stooped by here get a small bite ...   Ordered a fries for togo about 30min ago and recieved it about 40min after we ordered. Also didnt give us utencils and nepkips.. :("}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. The wings are incredible and I don't really eat wings often. I had the Hells Kitchen Burger. And the Jalopena Rita!"}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas for a week for business so I didn't have much time to enjoy the local restaurants, but there was one restaurant my GF and I could not be more anxious to try out. We both are huge chef Gordon Ramsey fans, we wanted to see if his meals were as good as they looked on TV! We showed up at about 3pm on Friday. It was a 30 minute wait in line just to see the hostess! Bring comfy shoes because there is nowhere to sit down unless you want to lose your place. I did see a couple come up in front of the line and retrieve a reservation they had made, so if that is a thing they allow I highly recommend doing it. There is a large fireplace with custom ironwork. It can be very warm standing in line so make sure you have layers that you can shed. But it was worth the wait. After getting through the line, we were seated immediately. I ordered a Backyard Burger with bacon and Dubliner cheese, I'm sure it tastes authentic with American Cheese but I wanted something a little more adventurous. I ordered an IPA cause you can't have a burger without a good beer. Their beer selection had a decent variety but not overwhelming. The food came fast but not rushed, I'm sure they take their time preparing. Burger was as good as I hoped it would be. I was surprised how high the burger was stacked, I generally like burgers I can fit in my mouth and not have to cut with a fork. And the spicy ketchup that came with the fries was interesting and good! Overall great experience. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Food was top notch."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've ever eaten! F-word burger and truffle fries were incredible! Can't wait to go back. Delicious Irish Mules as well!"}
{"text":"Great burger. Cooked exactly like I asked. Parmesan fries with truffle oil were fantastic, 1 order is plenty for 2 people. Sat at the \"Chef's table\" which is basically a counter that faces the kitchen. Pretty cool watching them pump out burgers at blazing speed."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Went with the recommended Forest Burger. The server was spot on describing it. We also ordered the onion rings & truffle fries to share."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is cool. Lots of things to look at and TVs if there are any sporting events.  The service, especially the waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. We always had full drinks and everything we asked for very promptly.  I unfortunately was not impressed with the burger; which is strange considering this is place is famous for their burgers. My wife however really liked her burger so perhaps it was just bad luck on my part.  Overall; I would recommend this place for a quick and reasonably priced meal.  Reply to Nicole: My burger was just overcooked, twice. I requested medium and it was well done both times."}
{"text":"Had to try this place when I was in Vegas. Have to say I was a little disappointed. The burger wasn't seasoned at all. The Parmesan fries were really good though. Very near flame decor on the outside."}
{"text":"I was sat at the bar immediately at lunch time on a Wednesday.   I've watched Gordon Ramsey's burger tutorial online a million times, so I had high expectations. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger medium-rare as recommended. It was perfectly cooked meat, juicy, tender, well seasoned. It's hard to keep that slippery jalape√±os pepper in there when you bite into it! Definitely provided a balanced kick without overpowering it, but definitely makes for messy eating and constant burger management. My bun was under-toasted for my taste, very minimal color when I opened it up. My friend's was perfectly toasted. So a bit of bun inconsistency. For a $18.40 + tip burger, I really think just a few fries could be included. Even in Vegas. Or maybe offer a half portion fry volume. It's a large burger so no way I could have finished fries and definitely not at half the price of another burger ($8-12). But I would have liked to try them. I'd still like to try the Farmhouse next time.   The spot at the bar had a/c blowing directly at me. Ok... I put my fleece jacket on. Still fricken freezing. 2 if the 3 men working behind the bar looked really unhappy to be working here. They weren't inhospitable, just appearing uninviting."}
{"text":"The logic behind my three stars is as follows: 5 star for the burger 1 star for the service. I realize it's a busy restaurant but I'm not sure how it could take 40 minutes to make our burgers. It was also discouraging when our neighboring table sat down after us and they got their food before us and left before we got our burger...  Maybe because we ordered some beer is why they took so long but we wanted cold beer with a good burger. By the time our burger came out beer has warmed a bit... I'm not sure if our order just got lost or entered wrong but for a high class restaurant it sure sucked.   Onto the food: (once it arrived) the truffle fries are out of the world! They come with their house ketchup and maybe truffle mayo? It wasn't too crisp but it wasn't soggy either! We ordered one order and it was plenty for the three of us mainly because the burger was big! I recommend the first burger I think it was hell burger? It's the one with roasted jalape√±os. Hands down that has to be one of the best burgers I've ever had. The meat was cooked perfectly medium and the roasted jalape√±os with the avocado was such a good texture! Add fries and ketchup and it was an excellent meal.  However I value service as well and while I would like to come back.. I doubt it."}
{"text":"What can I say.. there are mortal burgers and there is hog !!!  The chef takes us by hand into a mangalitsic triple delight. To start with, a moist succulent pork patty wrapped in bacon topped with slow smoked/ braised pork brisket with melted white cheddar sandwiched between toasted seeded buns. Cabbage tarragon mayo slaw coupled with crispy onions flavored with garlic, paprika, and cayenne as delectable toppings. Bread and butter pickles cutting through the saltiness of the bacon and sweetness of the brisket, completes the scrumptious package. Hog burger is definitely an ambrosial experience to relish in spite the long line to get in.   Gordon Ramsay Burger at Planet Hollywood is an urban casual spot for a gourmet burger with ambiance mirroring the peppy energy of Vegas.   Recommended, Cheers!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you have a party less than three or else you will have to wait in line for at least forty minutes. I am not sure why Ramsay cannot afford a system in which they send you a text when your table is ready. Not only do you have to wait, you have to stand next to the fire wall, which can get very hot.   We waited in line for about 40 minutes like suckers. After we were seated, we had to wait another 15 minutes for our waitress and then an additional 30 minutes for food, so DO NOT come hungry. The burgers were good but nothing unique for $15+ each. Eureka! burgers (a chain) deliver the same quality tasting burger for a lower price and shorter wait.  Since they were busy, our waitress barely checked up on us. What was even more annoying was that when we got our check, she made big circles around multiple things on it like \"tip is not included\" and the total amount, etc. as if we couldn't read.   tl;dr: ok-tasting burgers, not worth time and price"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this was mediocre. If you're expecting 'perfection' you will not find it here. My burger wasn't how I ordered it (medium rare). Also we were seated near the entrance so we got the heat from that fire display. Seriously, you'd get better food at the Subway in the food court."}
{"text":"Amazing! We took the crown burger and blue cheese burger, great taste, worth every penny.  The Gordon recommendation for bear was great (can't remember the name but it's includes vanilla taste)"}
{"text":"Oh.....My.......Gordon Ramsay! We're loving the burger bar trend, and this place sets the bar very high! The decor is super cool British themed, cool use of color and a walk of fire. The food was absolutely decadent. My husband and I shared the ultimate cheeseburger and onion rings. The burger was so fresh, the cheeses were tangy and smooth, and the sesame bun was toasted to perfection. We were happy we decided to add bacon to the burger, it was perfectly crisped and had great smoke flavor. The onion rings were breaded perfectly and served with a chipotle ketchup that is out of this world! The ranch sauce with the rings was good too, but the ketchup was a nice spicy treat for the ol tastebuds."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My favorite burger place!   The burgers are well balanced with a good bun to burger ratio.   And they don't drool drippings all down your hand.   They are on the Strip, so prices are high and the place can take a while to get in.   But as I said, my favorite burger and the fries are very good."}
{"text":"Definitely paying for the name here.  Extremely expensive and food was very disappointing.  It wasn't bad, but you have high expectations for Ramsay and the burger and fries were nothing out of the ordinary & not worth the price.  My husband and I both ordered fries because we wanted two different types.  The waitress asked if we wanted two servings, but didn't tell us that she was asking because each serving can probably feed 4 people.  Had we known that, we would have ordered only 1, especially after getting the bill and finding out the the fries were $8 & $11 each.  We had the truffle parmesan fries and regular fries, and there was not much taste difference.  They also come with different sauces, which we really didn't like.  I had the backyard burger.  Good, but not great.  My husband had the farmhouse burger, which was a mess.  It comes with a \"fried egg\" but it was just oozing egg yolk as he tried to eat it.  The restaurant is actually very small, and is placed at the entrance to a mall area, with two sides of the restaurant open to the shops, making it feel like a fancy food court.  I was really looking forward to this and was let down."}
{"text":"To sum it up - my second visit here with the wife was false hope for quality - with the visit being saved by the shake.   Second visit for me to Vegas and Gordon Ramsay burger joint and the atmosphere is great, starting with the flame wall at the entrance.   My last memory from 2 years ago was amazing. I was expecting the same quality. Having been at Gordon's steakhouse the night before, our expectations were high. We both ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries. The wife has a cocktail (signs of alcoholism for sure ;) - and I ordered the brown butter caramel shake.   The fries came out first, we were very hungry and the fries were excellent. The truffle Parmesan fries were square cut and crunchy with a hint of shaved Parmesan on top. The dipping sauce was amazing - some kind of mayo rendition with some type of peppers. The sweet potatoe fries were thinner cut and crunch - absolutely to die for. They had a touch of powder sugar on top, as well as some on the side if you wish to add more. The dipping sauce was a jalape√±o custard mayo type of sauce and is the perfect companion to the sweet potato fries.   A few minutes later, the burgers showed up. This is where the disappointment happened. Gordon and staff - if you ever read this - I suspect you take quality very seriously and I'm not sure if this was a one off or what but the burger was atrocious - almost not edible. It was overly salty, the bun was stale and overall over cooked (we both ordered medium). Wife and I both cook, and we would not want to serve anyone that type of quality.   Having ordered the shake, they must have forgotten it. The server apologizes and is in awe why it was not brought out already. She proceeds to bring it in a to go cup. Man, I am glad she did. It was perhaps the tastiest sweet item we've had in Vegas all week ( the desert at Gordon's steakhouse is top notch). The brown butter and pecan were rich and creamy - it does not let you put it down no matter how full we were. We were upset we didn't go back later that evening for a second round.  In summary - the fries and shake were a solid A The burger, which is supposed to be a signature dish, was a complete failure. Shame on Gordon Ramsay and his staff for putting out such a terrible product. We may be back for the shake but doubt it for the food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fastfood place..... I've tried White Castle, Shake Shack, In-N-Out but keep going back to Burger when I need a quick burger and fries (about 100 times so far) (yes really). My absolute favorites:  - Farm burger/bacon/egg - Euro burger/truffle/cheese/cheese/cheese - Hog burger - amazing piece of pork + delicious apple butter/sauce - caesar salad; I'm not a salad fan but I love this one - Toffee/ice cream pops (mandatory purchase)  TIP:  If you sit at the bar or request \"to go\" style, then your time wasted standing line is zero."}
{"text":"I always wanted to visit this restaurant so last night I finally did the waiter whose name is Paul was amazing very friendly the Oreo creme brulee milkshake was also amazing the highlight of the entire meal as far as fries and burgers it was ok I had higher expectations I guess if I do return definitely will try different burger the one I tried was hells kitchen burger since I'm big fan of the show it has something I don't know if it was jalape√±o or aioli but some bitter taste my daughter had farm burger she liked it no complaints overall the dessert and the waiter will get 4 stars"}
{"text":"Food  was AMAZING. But service was horrible. The manager greeted us which I thought was very cool. But the front desk ladies, chatted amongst their selves while I stood there, and later after waiting over a half hour for my food... I saw a chef stand in front of me on his phone for like 15 minutes. What the hell? What kind of people  do you employ.?? Disgraceful. Great food doesn't excuse poor environment and staff. Wouldn't return, my time is exponentially more valuable."}
{"text":"We are huge Gordon Ramsay fans and the food here was absolutely amazing. We waited in line for about 20 minutes and it was absolutely worth it. The onions rings and cheddar ranch were to die for! The meat that the burgers were made of was the best I've ever had to be honest. 10/10 would recommend even if the line is long to get a table!"}
{"text":"Hella good! This restaurant is located at the entrance of Planet Hollywood facing the strip. Came here on Saturday around 3:30 and it did not disappoint. Being a Saturday, there was a line and we ended up waiting about 45 minutes or so. Some bar seats became available and 2 groups in front of us didn't want them, so we happily jumped the line a bit.   Food: Amaaazzing! I wasn't feeling to good, so I nibbled at everything, but everything I tasted was so yummy. We ordered a burger (forgot which one), ahi tuna sliders, hellfire chicken wings and a side of fries. Everything was delicious. The burger and wings especially! The ahi tuna wasn't anything special, but wasn't bad either.I was sad I wasn't feeling well, otherwise I would've enjoyed the experience much more and ordered more food to try.  The restaurant itself is nice, clean and the service was great. We were very pleased with our experience here and look forward to coming back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. Waited over 1/2 hour for 2 burgers and fries. Burger was luke warm and fries were soggy.  Some people who arrived after us were served much sooner. Such a big disappointment, not Gordon worthy.  Won't be back for what what we paid."}
{"text":"Loved it! It was my first time here, we tried to come here last year while we were in Vegas but the line was super long. I would recommend coming here for lunch & arriving a couple minutes before it opens!  Let me just start by saying the ambiance is beautiful in this restaurant. The fire at the entrance lights up the whole room. The staff was friendly & gave service with a smile which is always a plus. Everything from the moment we walked in was amazing.  The food was the best part! We started with appetizers - onion rings & the mushroom poutine. Delicious! The onion rings were light & the flavor was so good. The cheddar ranch dip was the best pairing to dip the onion rings in. The mushroom poutine was savory & delicious one of my favorites. If you love mushrooms you'll love this dish! I ordered the ultimate cheeseburger, the different cheeses gave it such a kick! My husband ordered the hog burger & loved it! We also ordered the lobster & shrimp burger & that one was my favorite! Portions were a good size. Timing didn't take long since we ordered appetizers first.  They don't have a kids menu, but if you ask they offer to make a grilled cheese or a normal hot dog. We ordered our 1 year old daughter a grilled cheese & I can guarantee you I'll never be able to top that.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As a big fan of both Gordon Ramsy and juicy burgers, I felt obligated to try this place out while in Vegas. After wandering around trying to find this place (we didn't realize it was inside of a casino), we were finally ready to sit down around 10pm. Fair warning, since this is inside a casino, you have to walk through the clouds of cigarette smoke and crowds to get to the bathroom if you need to wash up before or after your meal.  As for the menu, there are tons of really enticing options. I went for the Hells Kitchen Burger, because I love spicy foods. I must say, the burger was cooked perfectly, had incredible flavor, and did not have insane amounts of heat. There was also a seafood burger on the menu, which sounded too good to pass up! A burger patty made up of lobster and shrimp? Count me in. But because it's a $26 burger, we decided to order it and split it amongst the table so we could all taste it. The burger ended up being incredibly disappointing. I suppose we had high standards due to the fact that it was so expensive, but it did not at all resemble lobster meat and just tasted like we were biting into a burger made up of shrimp. Not great.  All in all, I feel mixed about GRB. Food was good overall, but the prices are a bit high, the location isn't ideal, and our food took quite a while to come out, which was surprising at such a late hour when it was not too busy. You can definitely get a great burger here, just know what to expect!"}
{"text":"I don't know how people could say this place doesn't live up to its hype, because I LOVED my experience here! I had the lobster and shrimp burger  ($25) but it was $25 well spent! It's one of their specialties! The lobster and shrimp patty was so fresh and freaking delicious. The truffle fries were good but the sweet potato fries were even better. It had a nice crispy texture with powered sugar! Also, if you get the lobster and shrimp burger be aware that the pickled veggies are kind of spicy because there are jalape√±os in it! Besides that, its definitely worth trying and the service was great!"}
{"text":"For the long wait and slow service, you'd expect something truly magnificent. However I was a bit disappointed to find that this place didn't even crack my list of top burger places in America. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was good, don't get me wrong, but it was just lacking the pizazz or special ingredient that it needed to take it to the next level. It didn't have as much of a kick as I had hoped for and I thought the bun that they used was definitely lacking and could've been upgraded. Then there are the truffle fries. These are the biggest waste of money ever! They are more expensive than the burger and have very little truffle taste if any. They are also cut so thick they are essentially wedges. I prefer my truffle fries thin shoe strings. If anything, I'd recommend saving your money and just going with the burger when you come here unless you have a big group and would like to share the fries otherwise it just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Love the atmosphere I had the patriot burger and it was very filling!! Will definitely visit again when I come to vegas"}
{"text":"The food was great, truffle fries are surprisingly worth it. Often when a restaurant says truffle fries the taste difference is negligible but in this case, it was well worth it. I had the hell's kitchen burger. To preface, I do have a fairly high spice tolerance so the burger to me was just heated, nothing to freak out about, even though the server warned me I might want to have the ghost pepper cheese on the side. That being said, the burger was delicious, tasty, juicy, and held up to the last bite. We also tried the salmon toast, pesto mac and cheese and the hummus. All tasty.   The service was great. Our server, Heather, was extremely friendly, kind and helpful. She did the most to accommodate our family and made us feel very welcome, from menu recommendations to accommodations for our picky eater.   Would recommend. Great atmosphere and decorations."}
{"text":"This is the best piece of food I ever put in my mouth . I've never ate a stake that taste this good . I had the farm burger . We also got garlic parm fries and sweet potato fries . Both were excellent but even with four people I recommend just getting the burgers . With the fries it was to much food. This is a can't miss if your in Vegas . I wanted to go back before we left but ran out of time ."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, sat at the bar. The servers are very friendly and nice offering of burgers and sides. I had the forest burger and truffle parmesan fries. Everything was tasty and u can they used high quality beef. Ambiance was casual, comfortable yet trendy."}
{"text":"The burger patty was very tender and my favorite part. We ordered the poutine fries which were just okay- ive had been poutine. For burger we got the Hell's Kitchen burger which was very good. Patty was cooked how we like, good flavor. Takes 30 minutes for a burger to come out. The line was pretty lengthy too, but we got seated at the bar. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. I love Gordon Ramsey and my intent was to eat at all of his restaurants while in Vegas, but I always seemed to be too full from other meals and this was my only stop. We stood in line to get in mid afternoon and, while the line was long (to the end of the window), it went really fast. I read reviews that parties of two stand in line and larger parties go put their names in. I had a really tasty strawberry drink and we ordered the hellfire chicken wings, expecting them to be spicy, but they weren't at all. My bf, a huge wing fan, didn't like them, but I liked them, especially dipped in the sauce they brought on the side. We both liked this sauce and, when they tried to take it away, we asked them to leave it for our burgers - we were glad we did. My bf got the Hells Kitchen burger and I got an off menu burger that I was never told the name of, but it was topped with brisket, arugula, an aioli and picked shallots. My bf said his burger was just ok - underwhelming. I've never gotten tired of a burger halfway through...maybe it was because there was just so much meat on the patty, but I didn't get any other flavors coming through to give it a kick and it was just too much of the same flavor that I was sick of it. I ended up using some avocado and tomato from my bf's burger AND the sauce from the wings and even then it was just ok. I still didn't finish it. I wish I'd had a better experience - maybe I should have tried the lobster and shrimp burger?"}
{"text":"It wasnt the best burger for that price but a nice experience.  We got there @ exact 12pm on Thursday got seated immediately. But by the time we finished, there was a short line.  We ordered 1 helllkitchen burger and 1 lobster&shrimp burger, 1 truffle parmesan fries and 1 hellfire chicken wings with blue cheese. Ah an 1 cocktail (cant recall the name) The burgers are huge!! Luckily we were really hungry that we can finish all.  Chicken wings was what I was craving for. Im not a big fan of blue cheese but it was a good combination with the wings.  I would say the lobster burger was slightly better. The beef burger was well cook to what I ordered(medium well)  Truffle fries were a bit too hard (i think they were coated with corn starch). Service was Ok as it was not too busy."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and there fries are very good they get served on a metal cone very fancy but you can still walk in there in jeans very cool place and very good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, and has great taste for the value, HUGE DOWNSIDE is the wait when you can clearly see thru the window all the open tables!! What up with that?? It's not like they take reservations."}
{"text":"Over the years I've watched Gordon Ramsay on his show, \"Hell's Kitchen\" on Fox. I started to get less and less interested in watching reality TV but that never stopped me from trying one of his Vegas restaurants. I know Hells Kitchen just opened at Caesar's Palace but I was dying to try Gordon Ramsay Burger at Planet Hollywood. I was on a budget so I strictly ordered the classic Gordon Ramsay Burger with fries and just a glass of water.   Whenever I passed by the restaurant, the line was almost out the door. Thank, God I only had to wait 10 minutes and with the bar having open seating. I quickly stay down right away when there was an open spot. I didn't bother ordering anything else but the Gordon Ramsay Burger. Honesty, it wasn't excellent or below expectations. Maybe because I'm use to having gourmet burgers so it's hard to tell the difference. Let's just say the burger was cooked just right, juicy and tender. I'd comeback here to try other items on the menu. Now I can finally cross off the Gordon Ramsay Burger off my Vegas list."}
{"text":"Hands down, this place has THE BEST burgers ever! Delicious, fine burgers that are hard to compete with.  Love this place"}
{"text":"Me and my husband were in Vegas for couple of days. And every time we're in Vegas we always indulge in bomb A$$ top of the line juicy burger. And we like to try different burger joint every time we're there. So this time around we decided to try \" GORDON RAMSAY BURGER \" located in planet Hollywood.   We got there, got seated right away. Atmosphere was just an ordinary topical restaurant nothing fancy or anything. Only eye appealing was the fire place, which made it more formal.  We ordered ~  Truffle fries - thick cut, not much flavor, came out kinda cold. Not a fan :/  My husband got the Hells Kitchen Burger W/ Bacon - he rather have 5 guys burger all day long  I got me the ultimate Burger-  lack flavor and meat was dry even when I ordered it Med   Over all I was expecting more from this burger joint sense it is Gordon Ramsay. But there was no party or firework in our mouth. Wasn't satisfied and not worth $70. Like my husband said 5 guys are better and it's half the price.  Sorry Gordon Ramsay but you're burger and fires need re-vamping."}
{"text":"I would come back just for the kettle nachos and truffle fries. **get the nachos and fries!!!!!  The burgers are large. I liked that the buns were grilled but I didn't care for the patties. I had the hog burger. Too much pork for me and it was in the dry side.  I really wish they would serve fish and chips.   I liked that our waitress said we could order grilled cheese for our toddler. I probably would have ordered it for myself too if I hadn't gotten the burger."}
{"text":"THE best burger I have EVER had!   It was totally worth waiting 30 minutes in line!   Ultimate Cheeseburger was delicious! Everything anyone can want in a cheeseburger! Hell's Kitchen Burger...anything with avocado automatically tastes great.   Both burgers were amazing! You can taste the quality in the patty itself.   The Creme Br√ªl√©e Shake was delicious! Suggestion: make sure to finish the creme br√ªl√©e first. I was not a fan of mixing the creme br√ªl√©e with the rest of the shake.   All in all, I didn't expect less from Gordon Ramsay!  I literally went back the next day to have another burger, but looking at that line which we were most likely going to be standing for, for 2 hours or more is what stopped me."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on Friday 25 May, and was seated at the bar. We were served by this chap who said he was filling in from another restaurant. When I asked him what's good in the menu, he said he's never eaten the food so he has no clue what to suggest. Service was slow and food came out maybe 30 minutes later. Paying the check also took a long time. Apart from the really bad service - the burger tasted good. But take note that the burger costs around $15-20 and didn't come with any sides, that's an additional $9-12. The truffle fries was pretty ordinary l, but the onion rings were much tastier."}
{"text":"First impression wasn't great. While waiting in a line sucks, watching others constantly skip the line is frustrating. You can skip the line too we were told - if you let the casino open a credit card in your name.  This means that while you're told 20 minute wait you're really standing in like for nearly an hour, in front of a roasting gas flame too (to give the Hell's Kitchen aesthetics, but is terrible placement for a line). I have to point this out the lines wait because while we were waiting at end of the line the hostesses continued to tell people 20 minutes and I'd keep interjecting \"we've been waiting nearly an hour\" so those people's expectations could be more accurate. It felt they were being disingenuous to people who may have plans/shows to go to. In the end they also stopped offering people tables (except to those skipping the line) and could only offer chefs bar seating.  Once we sat down for the meal it was prepared quickly however my party agreed the burgers were really nothing special. My own Hell's Kitchen burger was kinda ruined by the half-an-avocado which just kind of slides out as you try to eat, pulling the toppings out.  The one great aspect of the food was the truffle fries and onion rings. Those truly were great, and we agreed we're worth waiting in line.  Unfortunately at the end of the night the computers all went down and no one had any orders or bills so waitresses had to go around asking for orders again to calculate bills - then said people needed to pay with cash or else they'd need to go find those carbon-copy mechanical-slide credit card machines. Wasnt a great final impression."}
{"text":"We've waited in line here more than once but always gave up because the wait was too long. However, we were determined to try the burgers on our last trip to Vegas when the line was just a half hour. The burgers were good but not oh wow great. The fries were those big thick slab type, but I like fresh cut thin fries best. The house made ketchup was decent. We had the onion rings as a starter and enjoyed the rings but not the dipping sauces.  We ordered our burgers medium well. Mine was a mushy medium, but husband's was cooked as ordered. We both think a Coke is a must for the optimum burger experience, but no Cokes here so we got nice, cold beers. The service was slow. The ambience was nothing special. I wouldn't stand in a long line to eat here again. I might eat here again if I were hungry, and there wasn't a line, but otherwise it's a pass. There are better places if you want to indulge in a burger."}
{"text":"We order the Farmhouse burger and the Ale Dawg. The burger had great flavor and was perfectly cooked, not dry and not dripping all over. Ale Dawg was not greasy at all which is tough to do with a beef hotdog wrapped in bacon. The only thing better than the food was our server Hilary."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries are amazing! Served with a jalapeno honey sauce that's rad. The ketchup is also fresh and delicious. However the trying to be trendy metal cone in which they are served causes most of the fries to become soggy before you get a chance to eat them.  The burgers are pretty lovely. Have had The pilgrim every time. Heard great things from my Indian lover about the indian themed burger.  A creme brulee milkshake shouldn't be served with whipped cream, covering the brulee top. Be sure to order without whipped cream! The milkshakes are too sweet, the creme brulee pudding is good but sweeter than a creme brulee- more like American vanilla pudding.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the chips n gravy.  I actually like getting the shake and fries take out because I can take them home and pop the fries in the oven and shake in the freezer, so the shake is thicker and the fries are crispier. It would be grand if they were thicker and crispier, respectively, in house. Fries gotta be crispy!   I also wish this location offered alcoholic milkshakes, I love a chocolate milkshake with Guiness or malt liquor."}
{"text":"I love the hamburgers and the decor. Nice selection of juicy burgers. I would have given 5 stars but I didn't care for the fries. They didn't have much flavor but the sweet potatoes fries are really good."}
{"text":"Awesome service thank you Michelle , awesome food, make sure to get the Oreo creme brulee Shake."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Las Vegas and Gordon Ramsay is one of those characters that you love to hate with the shows like hell kitchen and top chef Going to going to this place was definitely on today's agenda and also it was a tourist attraction and the fact that it was located in my hotel which was playing at Hollywood was another added bonus The greeters to the waiters to the cashiers everyone was pleasant and eager-to-please the menu itself wasn't that long burgers nothing shocking there I opted for the turkey burger option but my husband went in for one of the signature burgers that included everything but the kitchen sink which he got with fries we both have fries and drinks and for two people the bill alone was over 35 almost $40 but the experience was nice and the food was pretty good so no complaints you just have to know that you're going to spend a decent amount of money here for the name alone"}
{"text":"First , I waited in line for 20 minutes  to get in. Second, the waiters take forever to take the order. Third, they run out of sparkling water. How this is possible in a place like this. Maybe the chef Ramsey is bs on his tv shows cause this is not acceptable in a place like this. I did not go to MacDonald so I expected better. Fourth,  after I ordered the food I realized I wanted to order coffee (freshly brew coffee) but I could not find my waiter, so I tried to reach other waiters, but they did not care. I was amazed. The other waiters were looking for my waiter. It took me 10 minutes to order the coffee. Amazing. Very poor customer service. Plus the coffee was horrible. I don't know how they can call freshly brew coffee. Burguer tasted good. Not complaint on the burguer. It's pricey but here is Vegas so this acceptable. Finally, I expected better experience because of Chef Ramsey , but now I don't know what to think. Maybe that chef is full of Bs in his TV shows cause definetly bad experience overall here.  Again burguer tasted good..."}
{"text":"I was really surprised how \"meh\" the food was here. I love burgers and was really looking forward to Burger and after a long wait in line, I found the burger to be nothing special at all. In fact, I would rate several fast food burgers better including Five Guys and Smash Burger...and Gordon Ramsay doesn't even come close to Bachi Burger in town.   The truffle fries were dry and bland. After reading great reviews, I was looking forward to those as well but another let down.  I did have the browned butter caramel shake along with my Innis and Gunn beer. The shake was delicious.   I had the ahi sliders as an appetizer. That was ok but nothing great.  All in all, not impressive. The line is really long and it's a bit pricey which was expected. If you want a great burger in Vegas, Bachi is the best."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which includes asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes, and jalapeno pesto aioli. It was awesome! The combination of all the ingredients meshed well together, and the avocado was perfect in the burger.   But the WINGS THO. These were Deeeeeelicious! That buffalo sauce was perfect and not too sour with the perfect acidity, and the blue cheese sprinkles on top of the wings just completed the dish so well. The first time I came here, I ordered just the wings and had a bite of my friend's burger. He had some of the wings as well, but I just wanted to try everything since I love food.  However, the SECOND time I came here, I ordered the shrimp salad (which sucked so don't order salad) and since I wasn't satisfied, I ordered the wings. Since it was a bit much I asked for a box as well as the check since I was in a rush. I put half the wings (4 pieces) in the box, and devoured the other 4. But mannnn, I couldn't help myself and slowly but surely, I ate the wings one at a time from the box I was supposed to take home to my friend. I ate one from the to-go box and I was like, just one more. Then there were two left, and who leaves just two pathetic wings for leftovers? That's just rude giving somebody two wings, so I HAD to eat the rest... xD  Anyway, if you come here, get the wings and the burgers aren't bad too! I believe if you are a diamond or seven star reward card, you get to skip the line.  FYI both times I came here the food does take awhile to come out, so it's not the best place to go if you are in a rush.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I don't get why Gordon Ramsay BurGR felt the need to relaunch themselves.  A four star average spread over 5,400+ reviews seems like a damn good reason to leave well enough alone!  Not that it feels like much has changed.  In fact, we wouldn't have even known if our server hadn't mentioned it.  At the same time though, as modest as their remake was, the English/grammar nerd in me was pretty happy to see them put the \"e\" back into \"burger\" (yes, I get that the \"BR\" were for his initials...).  In all seriousness, the look and feel of the now-named Gordon Ramsay Burger is the same as before.  The only real changes I could see were with the menu; prices are $1-$2 higher (they don't have a discount for Total Rewards members anymore) and their burger offerings have been tweaked a bit (some have been altered, others seem to have been added/removed).  Thank goodness my friend was down to split a couple of burgers though; getting to try two burgers at the price of one = more bang for your buck!  -- TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES...$12 (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burger-las-vegas-3?select=okbyfgMxoiyZiSlZd_iztQ) In terms of taste, this was exactly as good as I remember - a decent amount of parmesan, the perfect amount of truffle oil, and all around delicious.  The fries were also just as crispy and flavorful as before, though the fries weren't cut as large this time around, which was fine.  -- HOG BURGER with Mangalitsa Pork, Mangalitsa Bacon, BBQ Pork, White Cheddar, Pickles, Crispy Onions, and Slaw...$18 (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burger-las-vegas-3?select=_SbSCPmhzVn-y2K7aI4Osg) With pork on pork on pork, this burger sounded awesome to a pork fan like me!  Sadly though, this didn't amaze (good, but not amazing).  The pork patty was super juicy and flavorful, and I loved the onion strings and melted cheddar, but I didn't sense much of the bacon or BBQ pork.  Not sure though if it's because they were lacking or if everything else just overshadowed them.  -- FARMHOUSE BURGER with Dublinar Cheese, Mangalitsa Bacon, and Fried Egg...$16 (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burger-las-vegas-3?select=lJrPb63uD2PTF9Xmti1I6Q) Though the Hog Burger didn't amaze like how I had hoped, this was terrific!  Which wasn't surprising, given the classic combination of toppings - soft, lightly toasted buns, a well cooked patty, a runny egg, thick and flavorful bacon (in this case), and gooey cheese.  Definitely recommend this!  Name change aside, it was great how our experience wasn't far off from the first time around - terrific!  The menu options, the food, the service...all just as good, even despite prices being a shade higher (to be expected after four years!).  While I still want to check out Burger Bar next door at Paris, and even though I'd still give Holstein's a slight edge by comparison, GR Burger is as solid of a choice as ever."}
{"text":"The decorations and burgers were amazing, truffle fries were great too, the staff was really nice she introduced us the featured on the menu."}
{"text":"I would describe this as a Gordon Ramsay themed restaurant. Everywhere you look, his face stares back at you. I'm not sure if they have a restroom inside but if they did, his name would be on the toilet seats and a photo of the man himself, hands folded, would be taped to the back door of the stall, judging you. His name and photo are literally all over this place. I get it, it's Vegas, but I feel like if this was on Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon would have a few wise cracks for the \"donkeys\" that chose the decor. THE FOOD: a tasty burger that won't blow your mind, but it's good. The flavors are there and they did not disappoint. Go if there's no line, it's convenient for you (staying in Planet Hollywood), you LOVE looking at photos of Gordon Ramsay, or are simply very very hungry for a decent burger."}
{"text":"Great Burgers Yummy Sweet Potato Fries may eat hear everyday this week! Great Service & Speedy Service"}
{"text":"Get the Poutine Fries - you will not regret it.   Food was great, sadly didn't get yelled at, or see anyone else get yelled at."}
{"text":"Unreal! Wow! If you are craving a perfect burger unlike any other in texture and flavor, this is the spot. This experience was excellent from beginning to end. Friendly greeting at hostess stand as we awaited our table. Our server was prompt, informative and attentive. Top notch service with much consideration.   Due to the volume of this establishment it takes 25-30 minutes to receive your burger of choice. Server recommended a starter since it is delivered quicker. The corned beef nachos served over hand cut potato chips were incredibly rich and delicious.   Kale/Romaine Caesar salad was amazing! The dressing was the star of this beautiful salad. Let's just say I never felt like one could be addicted to a salad but this one will get ya!!   The burger: OMGoodness! Unlike any other. It looks modest when it arrives but one bite and you know everything about it is special. We ordered the UK Burger, it is topped with Dubliner cheese, chutney and arugula on an absolutely perfect bun. The bun is topped with black and white sesame seeds and is pillowy yet hearty. The meat was so buttery and seasoned to perfection. You savor each and every bite and don't want it to end. It leaves you eager to try every burger on the menu.   There is a wide variety of burger choices and many appetizers to choose from. Fries are a la carte.   Even though the line can get long it is definitely worth the wait. If you are a burger lover or connoisseur  then it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here on a Monday morning right before our flight out of Vegas because we were staying at Planet Hollywood. We were hungry at 10:30am after we checked out and decided to gamble and have a drink at the Extra Lounge adjacent to the bar.   Before we knew it, we turned around and saw that a line was already forming for the restaurant. We were seated quickly and our server was super friendly. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger which was just a little spicy and cooked to a perfect medium. My friend got the farmhouse burger which she enjoyed but she ended up requesting a side of avocado to add because she wanted to add a bit of freshness to her burger bc the beef patty, egg, and bacon was just a lot of fat. She was told there was a $3 charge for it but when we got the checks it was $4. We were in a hurry and didn't mention it. The avocado they add to the burgers (whether it comes with it already or on the side is just one big piece of 1/4-1/3 of an avocado which I wish they'd just slice thinly and fan on top of the burger. I ended up doing this myself.  We also split an order of fries which was plenty between the two of us. They are steak fries and not especially crisp on the outside but tasted fine. It came with what I think was curry ketchup and a house made one so if you're just into Heinz, you might have to bring your own.   Overall a great burger, nice staff, and would stop at again if I were staying or doing something closeby."}
{"text":"I've never had such a rich burger. I ordered the hog burger and it was absolutely phenomenal. This burger definitely set the gold standard for burgers. While it may seem pricey for just a burger, you'll leave full and happy wondering how any burger could ever compare.   If you have any room for desert the chocolate tart was amazing! It had the smoothness of chocolate, with a slight texture of caramel. The way it melted in your mouth makes it worth it. While I'm going to have to run for days to burn off the calories from this meal, I would absolutely do it again."}
{"text":"Dang, how have I not written a review for this amazing joint? I don't remember what I ate since the last time I was here was years ago, but the experience was so good that I still keep telling people it's the joint to go for a delicious burger that won't break the bank! Anyway, just happy to drop a 4-star review to this tasty joint!"}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about that burger! I had the Tandoori Chicken burger which was tiny bits of chopped chicken in a delicious tahini vinaigrette with crumbled feta cheese. I will be going back to Planet Hollywood for another one. I loved it!"}
{"text":"A premium price for regular taste burger. Expect a long waiting time about 45 min and the service is slow about another 20 min. First and last time."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is excellent. The food, the service and the atmosphere are all top notch. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was great. I would only recommend if you like hot/spicy things. There is a great drink selection as well. This is probably one of the least expensive meals on the strip with this level of value."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I'm not a Gordon Ramsey fan. Never watched Hell's Kitchen, or anything. But the memes I find on the internet about him are hilarious!  Hubby had been wanting to check this place out for the past year, so during our last trip to Vegas over LDW, I thought what the heck, let's try it out.  We waited in line for about about 20 minutes, when one of the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit at the chefs table. I didn't really want to stand in line anymore since I was starving, so we took it. I'll admit, they made it sound like a cooler experience when they were telling us about the chefs table, so I was a little disappointed when it was just a bar counter. Fine, I'll let this pass, my expectations were a little too high.  This is where things went pretty sour. First, it took about 15 minutes for a server to say anything to us, another 15 minutes to get our drinks, and about 45 minutes to get our food. Considering that i was starving, I was in a pretty hangry mood. I couldn't believe how slow this place was. I'll give it to the cooks, they were moving pretty fast at times, but other times, they were just standing around waiting for the food to cook. I noticed that the burgers would all come at one time, about 5 or so, and then the cooks would just be standing waiting for more food to cook. It's like they would cook the food in shifts, rather than being constant. Why not just consistently be cooking, rather than putting everything together, then waiting for the food to be ready together?   Now about the food: I had the Tendori Chicken, lettuce wrapped. All I asked for was the chicken, and cheese wrapped in lettuce. Not too complicated right? Well, the chicken has some kind of sauce that took away the goodness of it. But since I was starving, I just let it go and ate it. But I wasn't a fan of this sauce. When I asked the server what this sauce was, she didn't know, and had to ask a chef, who looked liked he didn't know either, and then just settled it with being \"marinade\". Umm no, this was not cooked with the chicken. This was tossed on top of the chicken. There is a difference.  Hubby had the Backyard burger, no complaints from him. He thought it was ok. High quality ingredients, but not really worth the price tag.  We decided to share an order of sweet potato fries, which are huge btw! We both weren't a fan of the powdered sugar they added. I don't get powdered sugar on fries. Whats the point of it?   Overall, I don't think I will come back. There are better burger places around Vegas. At least I got hubby off my back with trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Gordo!!   I had this on my must-visit list when coming to Vegas and Gordo did not disappoint! Went right before the dinner rush, which I recommend. No wait for my party of two - walked right in.   The menu was fancy and short - so Gordon, am I right?   I opted for the most expensive burger on the menu, \"the foie\" . It was the second best burger I've ever had. Meat cooked medium rare as requested. Bun... the bun . Never really considered a bun to be a really essential part of the burger but this bun is special .   Skip the $12 garlic fries. Good but Not worth it ."}
{"text":"Well this was a great experience. We waited 20 mins in line. Server was attentive.  We rocked the nachos which were fantatsic. Corned beef wasnt too salty. Very good. Got the hells kitchen burger.  That bread was so soft. The meat was a perfect medium rare. Tons of flavor. The garlic truffle fries was a generous portion of tasty from start to finish. Great amount of alioli. Id highly recomend coming here. There is an emphasis on quality here we havnt found at other places. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Front of the line access for Diamond Members. Very friendly staff.  This was one of many restaurants I wanted to try when in Vegas.   I was lucky to be there during the week.  Ordered the Ahi Sliders, Truffle Fries and Cheeseburger. We were informed the burger would take about 30 minutes, but it was so worth the wait. Fries came out fast and so did the Ahi Sliders. Food was so delish....."}
{"text":"WOW . . . I mean. . . WOW  Not many places make me say WOW in a review with all caps, but Gordon Ramsay achieved that twice in Las Vegas! This was one of the two amazing meals thanks to Chef Ramsay!  Came by around 6:00pm on a Tuesday, not too busy and did not wait at all. We sat right by the flaming wall which really gave us a Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen experience!   I will start off with the biggest and quite frankly the only downside to the night...our waiter. All the other waitstaff and hostesses seemed so nice, friendly, easy going . . . but ours was an absolute ass. We sit down and don't even open our menu and asks what we want to eat. Really? The rest of the night he kept coming by trying to force us out. We didn't care, we ate and relaxed, left him no tip.  ANYWAYS now for the absolute best part - THE FOOD!  We ordered a few things, I will list them from least favorite to most favorite!  Pork Belly Hot Pockets - little hot pocket like pastries filled with pork belly, bacon marmalade, and topped with tomato jam and herb aioli. The flavors were honestly great. Tender, juicy pork belly, savory sauces, but it was just so little. For $12, the price to portion ratio just gave a lack of true enjoyment! But still good none the less    Farro-Quinoa & Chicken Salad - this was surprisingly great! A HUGE salad that my mom couldn't finish, even splitting with my dad and I, it was so much food! the chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly, the vegetables were all cooked to a delicious soft texture, the lemon vinaigrette was light and fresh, and the cheese added a nice creamy sweetness!   Jalape√±o Poppers - These were the. best. jalape√±o poppers. I. have. ever. had. WOW!  they bring out a long tray of six poppers, each in their own sauce cup. The poppers are HUGE! no cheapness there. The batter is thin, amazingly crispy, deliciously flavored, and inside ...WOW! jalape√±os were soft, fresh, and filled with creamy thick bacon cheddar sauce! Then the sauce each popper was dipped in . . . the cheddar ranch sauce . . .OMG . . . thick, savory, salty, rich, cheesy, ranchy, absolutely amazing combination !   Last but not least, the star of the night and the whole vacation - the Truffle Burger!  Let's start with the bun . .the soft, delicious, toasted, poppy-sesame seed bun . . . excellent! Then the thick, amazingly wood grilled patty, so juicy and tasty, perfectly paired with the following condiments . . . truffle tremor cheese, oh so cheesy, warm, creamy, slightly nutty, coating your mouth in cheesy goodness. Topped with foie gras creme fraiche, continually coating your mouth while mixing with the cheese for a  savory, salty, slightly gamey flavor and creamy texture. All of this topped with truffle aioli . . oh man, this was the softest, juiciest burger I have ever eaten! Adding some fresh crunch with the frisee lettuce, this is seriously one of my top three favorite hamburgers I have ever. ever. EVER. eaten.   Chef Gordon Ramsay has brought Vegas an affordable, delicious, amazing dining experience with some of the best food you will ever have the pleasure to enjoy!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars for this place. Not the best burger I've had but pretty close. The truffle fries were really good.  Had the forest burger which I liked a lot. My friend had the crown burger and liked it a lot. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Omg so yummy! That's all I have to say. Food was amazing. Took a little while but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We visited here 6/28, and we had high expectations. The restaurant was clean and nice, our server started off nice, but once we ordered drinks and our food she was nowhere to be found. We requested that our Truffle Fries come out before our burgers because we were hungry, after waiting 30 minutes, all of our food came out together! The burgers were overcooked (we both asked for medium) very disappointing! She also let my husbands Diet Coke go empty twice. This place is just an overpriced Red Robin. Sorry Gordon Ramsay, your food and servers at this place suck.  The only good thing was my cocktail."}
{"text":"As a long time fan of Gordon Ramsay finally visiting a restaurant of his, I was so excited. I ordered Parmesan fries and the Forest Burger and I am not lying when I say this was the absolute best meal I've ever had. The ingredients on the burger were ones I hadn't tried before so didn't prefer, but the patty just melted in your mouth. This gave me clarity on how all the burgers I'd eaten that were leaking grease were just that, but this was actually juicy and completely flavorful along with the perfect combination of the tremor cheese and mushrooms. That order of burger and fries has put everything else I've had to shame, most definitely a meal that will never be lived up to. Go to this restaurant so you can change your life and regret eating any other food forever"}
{"text":"The line was long but surprisingly it moved quickly! Excellent service, great food (very tasty) & absolutely LOVED the chocolate pudding shake w/Kahlua, it was definitely a heavenly dessert in a cup! We ordered the Hell's Kitchen & the special F -word burger!"}
{"text":"Top notch experience!  We came by around 8:45 on a Sunday night and ended up waiting around 10 minutes for a table for 2.   I opted for the Hells Kitchen burger and my husband had the Hog burger. When the food came, we got our Parmesan truffle fries (delicious!) and my HK burger, but they brought a Backyard Burger instead of the Hog. We have no idea if they sent it to the wrong table... but expecting no less from a Ramsay restaurant, they had to fire a new one, which finally came when I was almost done with my burger and we had already finished the fries. Our waiter apologized and let us know that they were taking the burger off the bill. The manager then came over to also express his apologies and explained the situation. He also offered us a free drink since our waiter had not offered one during the wait, so we opted for the caramel pecan milkshake (highly recommend). Management handled the situation extremely well and we would definitely come back.  My only improvements would be a greeting once you get to the front of the line..and our server could've been friendlier... but that's it!  *a photographer comes around taking your picture and will try to sell it in a cardboard frame for $10 FYI"}
{"text":"I honestly do not know how this place has a four star rating. From the moment we walked in. The hostess were uninviting, the waitress was extremely awkward, and it took 45 minuets after we ordered to get our food. I ordered the portobello mushroom burger, which was good. I will give them that. However, it was $17 without a side. It was good, but not $17 good. By the time we finished three burgers, and one fry cost us $75!!! There are several other places in Vegas you can go to get a good burger for half the price. You're just paying for the name here."}
{"text":"Had the wheat berry quinoa salad and it was very bitter. Not to my taste. The mushroom poutine was divine. And the lobster and shrimp burger was not worth $26. Overall for a Gordon restaurant, it didn't live to my standard."}
{"text":"First time here and I have to recommend the Hell's Kitchen burger. The beef was juicy and tender with some great flavors. If you like spicy this burger is a great option!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and was excited to discover the restaurant, I got the farm house burger. It was pretty good, maybe my expectations were a little high.  I would give it an 8.8"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday afternoon for a late lunch. Gordon Ramsay Burger is located inside of the Planet Hollywood hotel. There always seemed to be a line in the evening (7pm-8pm). There were four of us and we were able to snag a table immediately at 5pm. The staff here are great, very attentive and constantly refilling our drinks without us even having to ask :)  I had high expectations since this is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and I was not disappointed. I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger which comes with asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes and jalapeno aioli. This was one of the best burgers I have ever had, I loved the spiciness of the roasted jalapenos and jalapeno aioli and the bun was perfectly toasted. The burger itself was cooked medium well per my request, the meat was juicy, not overcooked and dry. There is a huge variety of burgers on the menu so if you are not a fan of spice, there are many other options. I also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries to share as a table. The fries were perfectly cooked and I loved the flavors. The burger is very filling so sharing the fries as a table was ideal.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I plan on coming back on my next trip to Vegas. The prices are super reasonable for a high end burger created by Gordon Ramsay :)"}
{"text":"Looks cool from the outside but extremely hyped up... They made us wait 25 min for a table... Once inside the waiter was off his rocker nutso and acted like he was drunk. The food took 30 min to come and we ordered 8 burgers and 2 fries ... We paid like 100$US for 2 burgers and 1 fries .. Waste of money!!!"}
{"text":"This is what a $30 burger and onion rings, no drink looks like :/ I'm speechless ..... Is it worth the experience? Would the price affect your taste buds and sensory organs? ......... for you to find out!"}
{"text":"It's pretty expensive, but the burger is worth it. My friend and I both split the farmhouse burger and the forest (?) burger with medium rare meat. The farm house burger was great. The egg was nice and runny, and the flavors melted together so nicely. The forest burger had great mushroom flavor and tangy cheese. The meat is so tender! They burgers are on the pricier side and fries are extra, so look to spend $20+ on a burger and fries. The burger is def worth it. They have unique dipping sauces for their fries."}
{"text":"It's a burger place. It's good. But It's a burger. Nothing amazing, nothing special. Would I come again? Maybe if someone insisted. Was this the best burger I ever had? Definitely not.  Food was ok but that's about it."}
{"text":"We were there on weekend. It's a very popular place so you should except a long waiting. If you have award membership like diamond/platinum, you can skip the line. So go straight to the front.   We sat and drinks order was taken immediately and we got them right away, however it took 45min for foods to arrive so you know how long the waiting is like.   Over all foods are good except my meat medium was kind of medium rare, so my husband ate mine. Oreo Milk Shake was really really good except they topped with very sweet cream br√ªl√©e and It wasn't really necessary. But I guess it's up-to the person who drinks and some people may like it. But not me. Next time I may ask to omit it."}
{"text":"The burger was good. The service was also very good and friendly. The reason for \"just\" three stars is the very long waiting time. We had to wait approximately 50 minutes to get a table."}
{"text":"The burgers were fantastically delish. Almost as good as in-n-out! Sure, I'd rather have an in-n-out burger at a fraction of the price but we were celebrating bff birthday. Fun, loud place. Long wait but why be in a rush when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"My bf is a huge fan of Gordon, but I personally think the foie gras burger is just great. It's not surprisingly good, but it tastes alright/great. The truffle fries are a lil disappointed tho. But overall it was a great experience  One more thing is that their beer is so expensive"}
{"text":"I have had better $20 dollar burgers. I'm not a hater but I felt like every burger looked the same, with different toppings. Same bun, same everything."}
{"text":"Best burger on the strip! Every time I come here, I never get disappointing. Considering it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, the pricing of their food is super affordable!"}
{"text":"Service rapide dans un cadre tr√®s sympa. Les frites a la truffes sont √† tomber par terre. Pour ce qui est des burgers ils √©taient bons mais pas les meilleurs mang√©s"}
{"text":"What a delightful experience. The food was great. The service was great; we thoroughly enjoyed the manager who brought us our delish bottle of wine. The ambiance was amazing. They mentioned they had their music up louder than normal for a trial run on how customers liked it, and we loved it! Great music! The employees seemed to enjoy it, as I was watching one employee who stood there and just sang her heart out while waiting for her tables food to come up.   Loved it! Will come back!"}
{"text":"BOMB. Best burger place I've ever eaten at. Honestly left feeling sad knowing I won't have this place at home.  They don't take reservations, but our party was fairly large and we needed a handicap-friendly table so they made an exception. We were there on a Sunday around noon and the line was about a 30 minute wait. We stayed at Planet Hollywood (where the restaurant is located) and the line was always long when we saw it.  I had the Tandoori Chicken Burger- every bite was so flavorful. And that goes for literally everything our party of 10 had. Our favorites were the Kettle Chip Nachos and Truffle Parmesan Fries. Seriously sooo delicious! I swear every bite my whole family would look at each other and say how good it is lol.  Service was 10/10 too. Crazy busy, but they still brought our food quickly and checked up on us often. Overall, an amazing dining experience! :)"}
{"text":"Great quality meat! Burgers are simple as far as not having many toppings. My husbands bacon was floppy. Awesome truffle Parmesan fries! Decent pricing for what I expected. My burger wasn't quite well done but that's ok!"}
{"text":"It is hard to walk into a restaurant without any expectation when you see one of the most famous names in restaurant business. Walking into Gordon Ramsay Burger, my expectations were very very high. Once you are seated you are greeted with a table setting that reminds you of the British Flag with and a simple menu on top with very minimalistic fonts with the name of the restaurant. The physical Menu it self even felt like there was a lot of thought, design elements and interaction put into it compared to a regular menu at majority of the restaurants. The drinks and dessert are on a separate tablet menu the server brings that seems a bit out of place and don't see the use for but I feel like its because of the limited space on their actual menu.    On to the food. I had the Anniversary Burger which also seems like the F-Word burger that wasn't on the menu. The patty is a blend of 27-day, dry-aged New York strip, Bone in ribeye and barbecue short rib. It's topped with frisee, pickled shallots and lemon vinaigrette. It seems like the design isn't very sophisticated and I like how simple yet flavorful it is. People might ask whats the point of all the best meat in a patty, you won't taste it.. but the truth is it made a whole lot of difference. you can actually taste the dry aged and the quality of meat in each bite. Parmesan Truffle fries are cooked to perfection with subtle yet enough seasoning and flavor of both Truffle and Parmesan in every bite of the Fries. It is hands down one of the best gourmet burgers I've had.    Service is a bit slow due to the place being so damn busy but it's understandable since the place was jam packed. The only gripe about this place is the waiting system. We had 5 people in our party and they were kind enough to take down our number and text us when our table was ready but for party of 2 or less, They said you have to physically wait in line. Though we didn't have to wait in line, this just didn't make any sense to me. If you already have a system of where you can take peoples name and phone number down, why can't you do that for everyone so they can go enjoy a little bit of Vegas instead of waiting in line next to a window full of flames?    Price is a bit high for a burger at $22 but I understand as it's hard to find anything to eat with less than $20 at a sit down restaurant in the stip of Las Vegas.    Regardless of the wait, and what other people may say, I personally enjoyed every bite of my burger and it was a extraordinary burger. it is definitely worth the try. c'mon it says Gordon Ramsay and how often do you have the opportunity to walk into a restaurant with his name in front."}
{"text":"What A Great Tasty Burger !!! Las Vegas has so many good places to eat  But did a search for the best burger in town and Gordon Ramsay Burger was one of the top choices. With the flame burner wall surrounding the restaurant give a modern bbq torch feel.  There was a wait to be seated but not super long for a Saturday night .  We opted for the bar seating to speed up the process because we were starving. *Good Beer Selection *interesting twist on Burger Combinations  Ordered the Ultimate Cheeseburger was juicy excellent taste yummmmm!!!! Had onion rings that were amazing  And French fries came with different types of dipping sauces.  *Customer Service started of weak with the first bartender not having a good knowledge of the menu. Then a seasoned bartender took over and had that playful attitude made a fun experience.  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"It was just foinee. I and my friend went to Gordon Ramsay Burger couple weeks ago. it was around late lunch time and still busy. Food is just ok cuz way toooo salty. I got sandwitch and my friend got a blue cheese burgar. I also ordered sprite and server pour WATER on my sprite glass. Ok I could understand, it could be happened. The worst thing was that our server was not really friendly but only paytime(when they gave us the bill) I could see his smile. Lots of people..good music.. It is fancy casual restaurant you could try for once."}
{"text":"OMG... delicious! Went there last night with family and ordered the hells kitchen burger, crown burger, and ale dog with truffle fries. Best burger I ever had. Requested the burger be cooked to medium and the temperature was perfect! Can not recommend enough if you are hungry for a good burger in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Skip the burgers, they are so-so. The appetizers and Oreo milkshake is what I find so good about this place!! If you have a sweet tooth, I strongly recommend the Oreo milk!!! It is heaven."}
{"text":"Didn't cook it medium on both visits this weekend . Very disappointing ! Management doesn't seem to care"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. The burgers are pricey but once you indulge in the flavor, you know it's money well spent."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I'm always skeptical when going to a restaurant that has a lot of \"hype\" around it because of a celebrity chef. Will the restaurant live up to expectations? Is it hyped up because of the name behind it? Are you paying a considerable amount more for something that isn't anything special? I mean this is only a burger joint!  Well, Gordon Ramsey Burger was everything I hoped it to be!   I went in with my husband and a couple of friends on a Saturday around 11:45-noon. There are no reservations, it's first come first serve.  The line moves pretty quickly, it was about a 15-20 minute wait... and we were about the 5th party in line. Not bad!   I love that the menu is fairly simple. There are enough options, but it's not overwhelming! Extensive menus are a bit of a nightmare for any indecisive person like me! Haha!   We ordered beer battered onion rings to share as an appetizer. They came with two dipping sauces; chipotle ketchup and a cheddar ranch. The onion rings were cooked to perfection, flavored well and the cheddar ranch sauce was the perfect compliment to them! It was a great start to the meal!   For my burger, I wnt with one of the more popular options; the Hell's Kitchen Burger. O-M-G! That thing was amazing! It was topped with asadero cheese, avocado, roasted jalapenos, and roasted tomatoes. The patty was so flavorful... it would taste good plain, that's how good it was! Seriously, there was a party in my mouth when I devoured this burger!!! It was tasty, memorable, and something I would crave!   My husband got the hog burger and that thing was MASSIVE! It consisted of a patty made of pork and brisket, wrapped in bacon, topped with pulled pork, crispy onions, white cheddar, pickles, and slaw! What?! He LOVED it!  Our friends had the Crown burger and I think the backyard burger. They enjoyed theirs. We wanted to share a variety of fries, so we ordered the parmesan truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and the chips with curry sauce. The fries' portions are large and can be shared. Having 3 orders between the 4 of us was way toooo much. I would stick with the parmesan truffle or the sweet potato.   We also wanted to indulge in a dessert and shake. I ordered the chocolate caramel tart which was chocolate cream served with hazelnut ice cream, hazelnut crunch, and milk chocolate! Sooooooooo delish!!! I would recommend it. Our friends shared the Oreo cr√®me brul√®e shake, they loved it.   Ambiance is lively. Service is excellent! And the food is tasty/memorable! If you're a burger fan, check it out...quality meat in the burgers and very tasty!"}
{"text":"If we are in the mood for burger, Ramsey's burger is the place we go. From unique to gourmet burger selections, it will be your ultimate burger experience. I normally like the: Hell's Kitchen burger, farmhouse and the chutney burger. You have to order the sweet potato fries, the powdered sugar and the dipping sauce is so good. The truffle Parmesan fries is also delish"}
{"text":"LOVED IT! I had the lobster shrimp burger and it didn't disappoint, with a blend of tasty and unique flavors. The service was incredible. Much faster than expected and our waiter was very attentive."}
{"text":"Do you think they have good burgers in the casino at Planet Hollywood?  Do your think you can have good burgers at a place that serves almost 2,000 people on a busy night?  Think YES people!!!  There are places more glamorous, with much better settlings, but if you want to get in and out quickly, have a shockingly good burger, and pay a reasonable amount then this is your place!  We all had different burgers, and we all loved them.  Ok, the chicken burger was undercooked, but the issue was rectified immediately, the item was removed from our bill without asking and the manager was great.  Good food, fast service and awesome fries!"}
{"text":"Because I am an avid cheeseburger fanatic and have heard many a good thing about his restaurant, this place was on my list of \"burger joints to conquer\". Pricey? Yes. But totally worth it for the aficionados.  What I had: the Uber Cheese Burger. Why? Because I love cheese and apparently have no concern over clogged arteries. It was melty, and tangy and loaded with delicious cheesy goodness. The patty was juicy and cooked to perfection. It really needed nothing else and hit the spot. The perfect accompaniment was an order of their crispy Truffle Fries with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Because no burger is complete without exquisite fries, am I right? The only caveat is the wait time which is standard here apparently.  Delicious decadence in a fun environment with a great wait staff....can't ask for more than that!"}
{"text":"The burgers were amazing and the truffle fries are definitely worth sharing, a must! My boyfriend and I shared the Hell's Kitchen burger and the Crown burger and I am sorry I did for the burgers back home will never be the same! I am not a fan of hot, spicy food but the Hell's Kitchen burger was great n not too spicy. The truffle fries were absolutely amazing! Sorry but In n Out should not be compared to these, even the best gourmet burger back home can't top these! The 45 min wait wasn't exciting but to me it was worth it to have had tried one of the best burgers! Love Ramsey n as always he does not disappoint."}
{"text":"It's effing RAW!!! I ordered medium. Friends ordered med rare. Their's were well done and mine was rare. Also I ordered no bun, my burger was brought with a nun and was told the chef doesn't allow modifications...dbags."}
{"text":"Key Points: Best burger I've ever had. A must-try on the Las Vegas Strip.  Two of my friends and I came here for lunch in the midday during an educational conference located at the Cosmo. We were pleasantly surprised to find this place conveniently located across the street at Planet Hollywood with only a 15 minute wait for 3 people, despite the long line out the door!  We all ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which the server stated was the most popular. That makes perfect sense, as why not name your signature burger after one of your signature TV shows?  The burger was cooked medium, as requested. The meat was juicy, savory, flavorful, with the perfect texture (not too soft, tough, or crumbly). The sesame buns that had just the right amount of firmness, without any stale taste at all. The asadero cheese added a nice touch, and almost looked like a fried egg. Hands down the best burger I've ever tasted, and I've tasted quite a few in the world. I guess you can't go wrong with something created by a master chef like Gordon Ramsay.   The three of us also shared an order of the truffle fries. Those were crispy, and delicious as well.. It was abundant enough for all three of us, with some left over. My appetite just wasn't at its baseline, otherwise I definitely would have finished the remainder of our fries.  Also, the place was splendidly decorated. Make sure to take a look at the blazing fire wall while you're in line and while dining in."}
{"text":"I thought this place was good but not great. Might have gotten four stars if not for the fact that they don't take reservations and always have a pretty big line. While I really enjoyed my burger, I don't think I would stand in line for 30+ minutes in order to get it again. There are lots of amazing burgers to be had in Vegas that don't require the long wait."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I really enjoy this place, and their burgers are delicious!! Their service is great, and it's definitely a casual place, but you can dress up and not feel out of place. The burgers are great! Oh, and the parmesan truffle fries are my favorite! The reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because I have kids, and there is not much on the menu for simple taste buds. I know, \"What are kids doing in Vegas???\", but as much as I don't like taking them to Vegas, they like going for the lights and nice rooms. So, we take the kids for dinner, because they need to eat too.  For parents: if you find yourself at Gordon Ramsey Burger, and you're with the kids, I would recommend the Chicken Sliders, just ask to get them plain. Also, wait times can be long. We waited 40 minutes for a table (5 people). Our last visit was Thanksgiving week, 2017."}
{"text":"Over an hour wait but so worth it.  We were so happy to see they had just added the Impossible Burger Patty to any burger for $6. The fries were good. Our waiter highly suggested the onion rings but they were blah. The Pecan Shake we ordered was so delish."}
{"text":"This place is truly a high quality burger establishment. Now was there a line... oh heck yes. However they will take your number and text you when a table is ready which is really nice. I had the parmesan fries which was amazing and my group had milkshakes with their burgers. I loved the version of milkshakes with the pudding in it. I like the different take on a milkshake. I have been here a couple of times. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"As someone mentioned, the wait is long! No only waiting to be seated but waiting to get the order. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was absolutely amazing. The food was definitely worth the wait, though! I'm already dying to have some truffle fries again"}
{"text":"I really wanna give this 5 stars because the food was perfect! So was the waiter! But the hosts seemed like they didn't know what they were doing as if they were completely lost."}
{"text":"Every year, we travel here (atleast twice/three times a year) for the Gooey Fries  I'm sad and probably not coming back because of the discontinuation of the Gooey Fries."}
{"text":"Great burgers and ambiance! I have to be honesty, I came initially for the novelty initially since watching \"Hell's Kitchen\" is a guilty pleasure. They have a variety of options (including a HK burger) to satisfy all types of eaters.   Blue cheese burger for $15 did not disappoint our taste buds. But the real stars of the show were the truffle fries ($12) and the off-the-menu special anniversary burger for $22. A lot has been said about the fries already, but let me tell you about this special burger. Yes, $22 is a lot in general. No, it's not a lot in Vegas. It was perfectly cooked to the requested temperature, the added brisket and frisee plus whatever else was on there was a great accompaniment to the meat - without outshining the star of the show.   Only negative, the service was slooowww. The tables seating after us received their food at a variety of different paces, so it wasn't like us waiting over 45 minutes for burgers and fries was atypical for that date. Perhaps the expeditor lost our ticket? Dunno."}
{"text":"Line was out the door so the food must be good...And it was!  Waited 1 hour for table and food was slow coming out but the food quality and our server Alex made it well worth our time. Salads were unique and flavorful. O-rings were Top notch and the Burgers BIG and Tasty! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good burgers with reasonable price. I ordered Hell's Kitchen Burger and it is quite good. Cost me $15 bucks."}
{"text":"My friends and I have decided to try out Gordon Ramsey Burger this weekend while we were in Vegas.  Host: 1 star  For anyone who is a first timer, parties of 3 or more do not need to wait in their line. You'll need to go to the host and tell them your name/number of people. They will ask for your number and send a text. Once when you get a text, you have 10 minutes to return back to the restaurant to get your table.   Initially, we had a group of 7 present, which we need to wait about 35-40 minutes. We then had an additional 3 more people added to our group, a total of 10. I went up to the host, Kelly (asked our server specifically what was her name just in case if she gave me a fake name), to change the number of parties. She again asked for my number but  I never received an updated text. I reconfirm with another female host and she also said they will resend a text. Guess what? My request was never on the books. We ended up with 7 people in one table and the other 3 had their own table on the other side of the restaurant. This service is not acceptable.    Food: 5 stars  Highly recommend: TRUFFLE FRENCH FRIES  Burgers do not come with fries. We've ordered truffle French fries, ahi tuna sliders, hellfire chicken wings as appetizers. I've ordered a crown burger, super delicious!   Server: 5 stars  We had great service from our server. She was very organized and friendly. Food came out quick.   Would I return to this restaurant? Yes  I understand that the awaiting guests may be overwhelming to the hosts but this type of service is unacceptable. People come to the restaurant because of Gordon Ramsey. The service may just be ruining it."}
{"text":"The line is a real pain, looks tacky for a high end burger place. Feels like a suped up TGIFriday's to me. Burger was mushy, too much bum for the burger. It wasn't bad it just wasn't awesome."}
{"text":"I had the best burger ever here!!! I had the anniversary burger I definitely recommend getting it! I know the waiter had said it was only a limited burger because they were celebrating something but if they have it when you go get that one!"}
{"text":"1. Amazing truffle fries 2. Sea food burger-shrimp/lobster was amazing - but pricey - 4.5* 3. Hells kitchen burger- pretty good 4.5 * 4.Hogs burger - good"}
{"text":"This review is for the hostesses and service only.  This is my favorite restaurant and the food is 5 stars, but the rude hostesses make me not want to return.  There were two groups ahead of me in line at 5:45 pm on a Friday night.  Half of the restaurant was empty, yet they were holding the line. I asked how long the wait was.  Without looking to see how long the line was, the hostess did 45 minutes. She must be psychic.  Food is great. Service is shit.  I can't imagine there would not be enough servers working at dinner time on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Very very good burger! Ordered the ultimate cheeseburger with veggie fixings and fries. Everything yummy!! Long wait but worth it!"}
{"text":"You should try onion rings! Was so yummy. Burger was perfectly done and delicious. Prices are reasonable and worthy."}
{"text":"Keep walking if you're hungry! The food is great, the service is average, the wait times are terrible. 1 hour to be seated, then another 40 minutes for the food to arrive. It was good food, but if I had known the wait time inside was so long I would have skipped eating here."}
{"text":"We we're so excited to try Burger. Finally getting the chance, we stopped in Saturday night right before 6. Surprisingly the line was short and we were seated within 5 minutes.   Our server was great, super informative. We ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger, Blue Cheese Burger and Truffle Fries to share. Our waiter told us it'd be about 20-25 minutes for food. I did think that was a little awkward to tell us that, but I appreciated the honesty. We weren't in any rush.   By about 30-35, our food came out. Looked amazing. Cut my burger in half a saw it was definitely well done (we had both ordered ours medium). Not a big deal but when Red Robin can get a burger done-ness right and not Gordon Ramsay, that's a bit of an issue.   The burger was great except the patty. All of the flavors were there. Loved the kick of spice and my boyfriend loved everything about his Blue Cheese burger. Except the party. Not sure why we waited that long to have over cooked burgers.   The truffle fries had the same issue. The flavors were amazing. But the fries tasted like they sat under the heat lamp waaay too long. And no surprise, if you looked over to the kitchen you saw rows of fries sitting under the lamp.   The kitchen was clearly behind which surprised me at 6 on a Saturday, not what I would think would be the dinner rush. There were plenty of empty tables around us.   Seemed like they were waiting for the kitchen to catch up because they stopped seating people for about 15 minutes. By then, the burgers seemed to come out a lot quicker.    I really wanted to like this place, and had our burgers been not been cooked to death and our fries sat out, it would have been 5 stars.   Service 5 stars. Flavors 5 stars but it's the kitchen that brought it down. Work on efficiency and this place would be so great."}
{"text":"My family ate here, and the service and food were a huge disappointment. My daughter ordered a hotdog, and when we asked for ketchup it wasn't what she was expecting. It was some sort of house ketchup, and they didn't carry plain. Our food was cold, and not to mention we waited over an hour just to get 2 burgers and a hot dog. Just to get our drinks took 20 minutes. The only thing good was that we were seated fairly quickly, only took about 10 minutes. The staff seemed careless and rude when we were asking about the different items on the menu. We came here thinking it would be a great atmosphere with amazing food, instead we got horrible service with mediocre food."}
{"text":"Delicious! Truffle fries were so tasty with homemade ketchup. Burger was seasoned perfectly, the pickles on it were the best I've ever had! Atmosphere was cool and clean, and I loved that you could sit at the bar and watch all the action in the kitchen. I gave four stars because our server was curt, and not nearly as attentive as she should have been. There is nothing worse than feeling like you are begging for a refill on your water. I would definitely recommend this place for the best burger I have had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had two burgers, the blue cheese one and the hell's kitchen one. I'd say neither was bad, but I'd also say neither was particularly outstanding, and given a moderately high pricetag (16-17) at lunch and a long line, that qualifies this place as overrated. The parmesan fries are solid. But honestly, if this place didn't have a celebrity chef's name attached to it, it would be nowhere near as popular."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our burgers here and the concept. My negative is that they don't take reservations and even off times there is a long line. So while I did enjoy it I would prefer to just go somewhere else than to stand on a long line because it is good but not worth it to me."}
{"text":"Ooh my goodness...the best burger I've ever had! The bun was soft, fresh and spongy! Th meat was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection! The Parmesan fries are excellent!! We also ordered the Oreo custard shake (yummy) which is perfect for sharing! Highly recommend if looking for a delicious burger restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are definitely worth the wait. We were a large party and they text our phones when our table was ready. That allowed us to grab some pre dinner drinks at the little bar around the corner. Server was super sweet and accommodating to the first timers!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth trying if you're ever in Vegas! It's a tad overpriced but if you think about where you're at, it makes sense. The service here is exceptional! Our waiter made sure to check on us occasionally to refill our water and crack a few jokes.  The Truffle Parmesan Fries ($12) are pretty good. My favorite part is the dipping sauce - I'm pretty sure they make it from scratch (Fresh tomatoes and truffle oil, etc)  Hellfire Chicken Wings ($14) are amazing. Huge pieces, juicy, and an explosion of flavor! I definitely would choose this over their fries.  The Crown Burger ($15) is probably my personal favorite. It's extremely flavorful and the meat is spectacularly cooked - make sure you order no more than medium (I suggest getting medium-rare though).  The Hell's Kitchen Burger ($16) is alright. If you like spicy, this may be a good choice - but I personally don't think it tops the Crown burger in terms of flavor. Again, make sure you don't over medium for the meat!  The Lobster and Shrimp Burger ($26) is delicious. It's something worth trying once if you're a seafood lover. The proteins are cooked nicely. The only thing that makes this a turn-down is well.. The price."}
{"text":"They don't take reservations, but they do text you when your table is ready. So put your name on the list, then walk around Planet Hollywood to gamble, people watch on the strip, shop in Miracle Mile, or get a drink at their bar while you wait for your table.   It's kid friendly, casual, and not insanely priced. You still get a taste of \"Gordon Ramsay\" without breaking the bank. Everything is a-la-carte, so fries are extra. But one order of fries is enough for two people to share, and you can choose from several different types of fries, so it makes sense.   All of our food (and drinks) came out quick and hot. The hostess, server, food runners, and bussers worked well together making sure that all tables were taken care of in a timely manner. Out of the 4 of us, we all left full and happy!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good!  We ordered the Blood Orange Cosmo's, Hog Burger, Ultimate Cheeseburger, Truffle Fries and got a small creamsicle desert.  A little pricey but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES!!!!!  We had one of the best restaurant experiences that we have ever had in Vegas! We loved it so much, we ate here for majority of our vacation.   Just about everything you need to know:  Gordon Ramsay Burger is located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino Resort. He has several restaurants in multiple hotels so don't get confused! When you arrive to Burger, you have to wait in a line to get in. We got lucky with the times that we went and didn't have to wait in line very long but it does get packed so be prepared to wait! The hostesses were so nice and friendly and made us feel so welcome. It was really cool that one of the hostesses remembered us and welcomed us back.   The restaurant is a nice size and the atmosphere is really cool. They do not tolerate drunk and obnoxious guests which was really refreshing!  Service: On both occasions that we went, we had TERRIFIC service! Both of our servers were very knowledgeable of the menu and checked up on us multiple times during our dinner. One employee who really stood out to us was the busser Caleb. Caleb was absolutely a joy to see on both of our trips to Burger. He was one of the kindest employees at a restaurant that we have ever encountered. He deserves a promotion, raise, or something. Just watching him take pride in his job and smile at every table was so refreshing.   Food: YUM!!! Over the course of 2 visits, I had the \"Hell's Kitchen Burger\", the \"Backyard Burger\", \"Beer Battered Onion Rings\", \"Kettle Chip Nachos\", and \"Truffle Parmesan Fries\". Everything was PHENOMENAL, except the Fries. They were not as great as I think they could have been but everything else made up for it. Make sure you request your burger to be cooked the way you like it. They normally make it \"Medium\" which is a bit too pink for me.   Prices: I think the prices are spot on. The price is definitely worth the food.  Overall, This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. I highly recommend it and we will definitely be making it a tradition to come here at least once when we come to Vegas.  I hope this review helps you decide on where to get a delicious \"Burger\" when you come to Vegas!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Service here was on point! Adam our server was super attentive and that made it worth every penny! I got the blue burger and my husband got The Hog burger, and we also got the onion rings as a starter. The onion rings were awesome, crunchy and delish! The Hog was super flavorful but MESSY and a little on the greasy side.....but delish! The Blue burger was good, I wished it had more arugula and the figgy jam on it, the blue cheese was super overpowering. I gave it 4 stars mostly for the service if it was just for the food I would have done 3."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and it doesn't disappoint.  The burgers are cooked perfectly.  Love the truffle fries!"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place... about a 30-40 minute wait but completely worth It... service was fast enough to calm the \"hangriness,\" but not fast enough to make you worry about the actual freshness of the meal. I had the portobello mushroom burger and my husband had ( can't remember the exact name) a burger with bacon, cheese, and egg and we shared the Parmesan truffle fries... everything was tasty, fresh, and inventive."}
{"text":"The burgers are over priced and nothing special they lack flavor and small for $16.00 without fries. The shakes are good but wouldn't get a burger from there again. Gordon Biersch has much better burger."}
{"text":"Wow...  burgers are so good.. It is pricy but very tasty...  I ordered Hell's  burger and Farmers burger with Putine  fries and Truffle fries...  The door opens at 11 am but already long line was formed...  I would say at least 30 people waiting in line..  Luckily I was 3rd person in line.  In the beginning dining area was empty but in minutes, whole place was filled up.  Hell's burger was very spicy... So if you can't handle hot spicy food, I don't recommend.  However, Farmers burger is good for every age.  Uncooked york of the egg makes burger more juicer and nicely blends with the patty.  Putine fries are nothing like the ones I ate in Canada..  It was totally different but visual, and taste is something you must try..."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times and have found the food and the service to be excellent.  The burgers are always fresh and delicious and cooked as I like them, rare.  The burgers can run $15 to $22 but  the mixed drinks and desserts are priced below normal for the Strip.  But price doesn't matter if the food is excellent!  In the world of burgers, this place is a real stand-out. The only downside is you will most likely wait on line for about 20-30 minutes and also wait that long for your food."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I'm rating only four stars because of the wait, we waited almost an hour for our food and the appetizers came out with our meals. There was also a pushy photographer who took our picture and tried to sell us the pixilated prints. I felt like that cheapened the experience.   However, the food was excellent. No complaints there!"}
{"text":"This food tastes like a smoker made it. Salty. The staff is friendly but the meal below a standard burger place. The pricing separates even the burger from the fries. I'd pass on this place. The celebrity chef element brought nothing to the proverbial table."}
{"text":"Really over the top for a burger place, fine fast food if you will, everything from decor down to the burger bun was perfected, the quality beef, the perfectly melted cheese, the spicy pesto, the fries, the curry ketchup that came with the fries, really unique. We get so used to burgers being this widely available junk food, this place gave the burger its glory back, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love coming here, keep in mind they do not take reservations, they will take your name & number once you get there. We waited about 30 min on a Saturday night, not bad. The burgers are excellent along with truffle fries. Yum !"}
{"text":"$14 min for your Burger, hot dog or otherwise. It's good, but I've had just as good a burger if not better at places that give you fries with your menu item. We ordered the tuna sliders, parm fries and the bangers and mash. Fries were ok, but a little dry, not made to order. Dipping sauces were the star there. The garlic aioli was fantastic.  The tuna sliders were good, lacked the burst of flavor I think we were hoping and expecting it would have. Bangers and mash was pretty decent, the little potato balls were awesome, the roll the sausages were on were fresh and delicious. I can't complain overall, however - devils always in the details.  That being said the curry dipping sauce I requested on the side had been sitting in the fridge and I had to stir it up a little to be able to dip anything in it.  When you're paying $25-30 for a burger and fries..... I expect little things like that to be right.  It just sort of misses the mark for me.  I've been here before and said the same thing.... I only came back because my sister had never tried the place and wanted to go.  I can't really say that I'll be back.  The novelty is in the name, certainly not the dishes."}
{"text":"Good burger. Mine was very salty which is why I deduct half a star. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger. However the bun was delicious, the party cooked perfectly to order. I would return to try the other burgers.  The other half star deduction comes from the service. The host staff is chatting on their phones while a long line is waiting to be seated. Every once in a while she looked up to engage the customer who would be instantly seated at one of the many available tables.  Once finally seated it was hard to flag down your server. Burger took over a half hour to prepare after order and it took almost as long to wait to pay the bill."}
{"text":"We are sad that we visited Gordon Ramsay Burger on our last day in Vegas!  Wished we would have the first day so that we could go back on our last day.    Husband ordered the Yardhouse and I the Hell's Kitchen burger (replaced beef patty with turkey patty).  OMG- the burgers were very moist and juicy!    You know it's a good burger when you see the patties glistening and juicy, however, no grease at all on your plate or fingers after you are done Inhaling it.   I don't care much for onion rings or fries and boy were the onion rings Delicious!  We also Inhaled the onion rings with its two dipping sauces within minutes!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"With all things in consideration, you get a gourmet burger for a good price. I was even more inclined to go because I'm a huge Gordan Ramsay fan.  You are welcomed with a wall of flame on the side of the restaurant. It feels a little bit like you're eating inside of Hell's Kitchen. Flashbacks to all the seasons I've watched... Anyway, I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was cooked very well. Each bite gave me goosebumps. We also ordered a side of truffle fries which was seasoned perfectly.   The customer service was top notch. Our waitress did a great job keeping our party of 10 happy. With Ramsay as their boss, who can dare to mess up? This place gets a thumbs up in my book!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible! We were seated at the empty chefs' counter, put in our order, and subsequently the seats next to us were filled by two other pairs. Both of the other parties got their drinks and fries before us and eventually I ask if we can have our fries. We can see that dozens of fries have been prepared and gone out..... the waitress says yes, but the fries don't show up. Had to ask again. Burger comes out and it's ok. Not as good as previous times. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't miss out on these burgers. That will be the best you have ever had. The service is exceptional. The Mediterranean burger is made with lamb. It is my favorite. My wife likes the blue cheese burger."}
{"text":"Loved it! Felt like I was treated so well. Each flavor was perfect. I couldn't believe how yummy the food was.  We also had shakes that couldn't have been better. This place is great for a birthday or special occasion because it will surely be a great memory and very filling!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised that the burgers were tasty, fresh and original. Service was excellent and the decor was interesting. Great price for a nice Vegas burger!"}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER WE'VE EVER HAD!!!! If you are ever in the Vegas area, you must go there. My son ordered a burger, The \"F-word\" burger that had short rib, brisket and another steak all ground into one SUPER juicy, FLAVORFUL  burger!!! (Note: it's NOT on the menu! Seasonal??) The onion rings were very DELICIOUS!!! This will be my family's go to place every time we are in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Our server was personable, and he took very good care of our table.  We mentioned in conversation that it was my daughter's birthday.  The place was packed, and we weren't expecting anything, but he made her feel like a princess.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"AWESOME burgers!  A little pricey but that's what you get with a celebrity restaurant on the Vegas strip. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great environment, good food, poor service.  If you're in a party of 4 or more, you can skip the line and go straight to the front to give them your name and number. They'll text you once your table's ready. When my party of 5 came on a Sunday, we checked in at 1:30pm and our table was ready at 2:15pm. By the time we sat down, our waitress - who seemed very unenthusiastic for having to work that day I might add - said the burgers would take half an hour to make. HALF AN HOUR! Our appetizers came out within 15min but our burgers actually didn't come out for another 45min. Imagine how hangry we were.  The Onion Rings and Truffle Fries are great to share with a group of people. The dips that each come with add a lot more flavor. They were both good but not great, I've definitely had better for less.  Forest Burger (mushrooms, arugula, duck bacon) - I loved the combination and it sure was tasty. I was intrigued when I saw the duck bacon but wasn't a fan when I actually tried it. There was no duck flavor and it tasted essentially like salty dried meat. Normal bacon would've made it better. However, the beef patty was delicious - probably the best I've had.  Farmhouse Burger (bacon, fried egg) - I personally liked the Forest Burger better but the 3 others I came with preferred this burger. They used normal bacon here which was a plus.   Bottomline: The food is good, but for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, I expected more... and better service."}
{"text":"Had the U.K. Burger for lunch and it was quite delicious. The bun was grilled and had a crispy bottom which is typical of Gordon.   Also had the sweet potato fries which came out before the burger. Came with powered sugar and an aioli sauce and they were incredible. Paired with a beer will set you back about $35. Sat at the bar - overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple. I've had better burgers at Wendy's. Burger was tasteless and portion size was on the super small size. The best food were the sweet pickles that came on the burger. The only thing worse than the crappy food was the terrible service. Had to wait 15 minutes to see a waiter and then saw him only twice more during the hour we were there. The place wasn't super busy and the staff seemed more interested in flirting with each other than doing their job."}
{"text":"Was not that impressed, there was 7 of us, waiter forgot my ice tea and chicken wings, he did make it up to me by giving me free chicken wings. The chicken wings were bad, we all ordered different burgers medium and they looked rare. Can't believe  this is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the waiter gave me the free chicken wings even though we could not eat them. Gordon Ramsey I need your apron!"}
{"text":"The burger tastes okay. Nothing special . It took them 30 mins for a take out burger to get cooked. Way too expensive for mediocre burger. The $22 \"fioe\" tastes cold and bitter , maybe bc it took them way too long to cook and they won't call you once it's done to pick up.   After 30mins , once you are there to pick up - it will take them 5 mins to go to the kitchen to get the burger up then another 5 mins if you want sauce like ketchup. Not sure why  they think customers will say no to ketchup when eating burger and fries ."}
{"text":"Located in Planet Hollywood this place was a must try for me.    Went for the farmhouse burger.  Super juicy, cooked to order, and for a Vegas named chef place not a bad price.  Had truffle fries on the side.  These were a hit at the table.  Pricey but a single order can easily be split by 3 people.  Way more than anyone should solo but I might try.   The Good Good burger.  Fun atmosphere.  Waitress was on point.   Fair prices considering.   The Bad Can be a wait to get in but not terrible.   The Ugly Nada. This was worth the stop."}
{"text":"The mouth watering jalape√±o bombers here are just straight from heaven . They are literally the best ever!! They come in a 6 piece all individually dipped in a cool house ranch and all of them are not too spicy except one or two of them! They do it on purpose yes it's for those to enjoy it if they can't eat too hot! But excuse yourself if you get the really hot ones! Rip! Sliders and burgers are also great! Good size burgers not too big not small at all but fills you yo good. Long wait at times but get there at a perfect time when there's no line stop right in!"}
{"text":"We stopped here before the rush however it was still busy since being in the casino. My husband wanted to try since well it's Gordon Ramsey. We got sat at the chef's counter. I thought maybe the chef would actually talk to us like he did to some of the other customers sitting down from us but he didn't. Maybe he was afraid we didn't speak English? In any case our servers were pleasant. I'm assuming they share tips since we had multiple ppl serve us. We ordered the hells kitchen burger and forest burger. My husband said the hells kitchen burger tasted like a normal burger with some spice to it. Mine was made of lamb, which i don't recall reading in the menu but maybe I missed it. It also had duck bacon, arugula ( which is the latest big fad to add to a sandwich) and some cheese and mushrooms that i don't remember the spelling of. Since I expected beef and turned out to be lamb it was obviously a surprise. Overall the burger was good but nothing like I would jump on the chair like Tom Cruise on Oprah Winfrey show or anything.  We also had the parmesan truffle fries which literally were french fries sprinkled with fresh parsley and shredded parmesan cheese. There was nothing truffle about it.  Since we were sitting right where the cooks work I literally saw the fries get fried, dumped in a cone, and then a waitress dashed some parsley on them and took a clump of cheese to throw on top and then they served it to us. Not sure what the sauces were as no one explained them and everyone was too busy to ask. Definitely not ketchup or mustard. I would say the red sauce was like a pizza sauce and the mustard was lije a mustard mayo butter mix. Overall it was a good experience and just to say we went to a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant, but wouldn't eat here twice."}
{"text":"It was kind of a disappointment. The restaurant was very pretty, the beer was good and the truffle fries delicious, but the burger we ordered was what we ordered. My girlfriend ordered hers medium well and I ordered mine medium. When they arrived, mine was well done, and hers medium-rare. The server offered to get a new one at the end of the meal, but that would take around 30 more minutes."}
{"text":"I started off my review w 5 stars until my food took an hr to get to me. Expect long lines & very snail slow service. On the positive side, the chocolate creme br√ªl√©e shake & Parmesan fries were fantastic. FYI-burger buns hav a lot of seeds on them."}
{"text":"The burger was delicious BUT them expensive ass fries were dry no flavor at all . Service was awesome I'm a fan of Ramsey love all his shows was disappointed that the fries were awful"}
{"text":"I was dining alone. When I inquired about bar seating, I was told by the three hostesses to wait in line for a place at the bar...that they would come and get me as soon as a place was free. After 25 minutes, 4 places opened. I waited and watched the 3 hostesses laugh and chat with each other while the four spots remained empty. 10 minutes (yes I timed it) and I decided to tell them places were available.  They laughed and pointed to the bar saying I should go sit. When I said they SAID they'd come and get me, they giggled and said \"you can have a seat\". Unbelievable.  Many tables empty with a line of 20 people waiting. I have no problem waiting but when there are at least 5 tables, 4 bar stools available...and the hostesses are ignoring us...something needs to be done. Now onto the food! I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger and truffle fries.  Both were delicious.  I expected the burger to be thicker bit it was really good. Bar staff were attentive and friendly.  I'd have given 5 stars except for the hostesses...who still haven't sat people at  3 empty and clean tables (and I'm only giving a quick glance) to the people waiting."}
{"text":"This is worth the wait and cost!!! I ordered the special burger and my husband had the ultimate cheese burger. Most delicious burger I have ever tasted!! Service was great!! I'm gluten free and this place is great!!!"}
{"text":"We got the hell's kitchen burger and the curry chicken burger. They were both slightly above average and that's what gives this place a 2 star rating. There ends the pros of this place.  There were more than enough tables to get us seated, yet we waited for 15 minutes just to get a table. We ordered a creme brulee shake that we received after I was almost done eating my burger. No apology for the service?   Overall service was horrible. So much for being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Not going to return to this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have different burgers with separate side dishes. Tasty, juicy and just perfect. The only 2 things was the waiting on line, but then it's because people wait for this perfect burger and they only have 1 type of soup. Cheddar with ham, which was mostly cheddar and bacon with some slices of potatoes. Alittle too heavy. I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Good food. Not a typical burger and fries joint. Good flavor . I had the hella kitchen burger it needed a bit more spice since thats is what the description said. Food takes a while if your not in a rush this a spot friendly service"}
{"text":"Meh. Satisfied the need for hunger but I've tasted so many better burgers. Not impressed. Maybe this is considered really good for the Vegas area, but no comparison to Texas burgers!"}
{"text":"Got here right after they opened - no wait. I sat at the bar, and was helped by a very attentive bartender/server. I ordered a beer and the Farmhouse burger. I really wanted to try the truffle fries, but couldn't deal with the $11 price tag. As it turned out, that was fortunate, because the burger was so filling that I couldn't have done justice to both the burger and the fries. My situation in Vegas wasn't one that played well with doggie bags, so it's good I nothing left to take \"home.\"  Best burger I've EVER had, and I've had a LOT of burgers from a LOT of excellent burger joints. Perfectly cooked (I ordered mine medium rare), juicy, delicious, impressively complemented by the egg and bacon. Maybe you've never heard of mangalitsa bacon, but don't let the unfamiliarity of the name scare you off. Order this bad boy. The bun was awesome.  $15 for a burger without fries? Well worth every penny."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had with handmade ketchup to go with your fries. Mic drop."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to GR Burger. First two were amazing. This one no so much. Burger was great. Fries were over cooked. Sent them back and they came over cooked again so we gave up. Server seemed to forget us too. Started well. Then waited over 20 minutes for a refill. I used to look forward to coming here whenever I visited Vegas but don't think I am coming back."}
{"text":"This is my review of Impossible Burger at Gordon Ramsay Burger. Overall not a super vegan friendly place but my server Justin and the expediter on the line really put in the extra effort.  Ordered the Bleu Burger -cheese -mayo on the lettuce wrap (bun has dairy) and drizzled the cider vinegar reduction over it (assured me the binder is xantham gum - Thank you ) and steered me clear of the truffle fries because apparently there is also some dairy in the truffle salt. So there you have it  The taste came out amazing and I especially enjoyed the figgy onion jam! Overall it was a very friendly vegan experience for a burger place."}
{"text":"The glass flame window is hard to miss upon entering Planet Hollywood. The menu design was also an interesting fold, simple and clean.   I had the Hells Kitchen burger, as a spicy lover, it was amaaazing! It is worth the price, the meat was cooked to perfection, medium rare and delicious. You can taste the flavors of all that goes into this particular burger complementing itself, i did add a little of the truffle fries aoili dip and it was goood. The fries are enough to share for two, their drinks looked prety good as well, all 3 of my coworkers got something different and they mentioned it was also amazing. I will definitely be back. Heads up If you will be driving here, probably best to park in the mall."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Here's my experience: -The hostess was super friendly and sat me right away. -My server (Ashley) was super friendly and did a great job checking in often, but not too often. Service definitely got this place the 5th star because she was a super star. -The manager of the restaurant checked in once to see how everything was and was very friendly. Nice touch. -The Onion Rings were really good. It's easy to take onion rings for granted because they are something that is just so simple and commonly served. You forget how good they can actually be sometimes. - The french fries are good if you like A thick cut french fries. They were nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Perfectly cooked. Seasoned well. - The burger I ordered was rather plain as it just had meat cheese and bacon only. I wanted to see what the burger was like without tons of toppings on it. It was absolutely ridiculous on all levels. The meet was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing, the bacon was cooked perfectly, and the bun that they used that was toasted was absolutely perfect.  With fast and excellent service along with incredible food, I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great burger! Great service! I will return, YES. I had avocado in my burger. I was SOLD! Plus, the server was very humorous and attentive. I know it's Just a burger.. I had a very pleasant experience at this place and I feel like giving five stars."}
{"text":"Horrible, disappointed experience, tasteless, greasy, we ordered just regular French fries and onion rings and we couldn't eat it because the oil where they cooked is the same for the all food and it's completely disgusting feel the flavor. No comments about burgers I make better at home. Even IN ND OUT it's better. Don't spend your money here."}
{"text":"We was her in September and did not have a great experience but give it a second chance and thanks the the manager Jonathan we had a great time and the food was amazing.i had the farmhouse burger and my wife had the forest burger we had the nachos and regular fries all the food was outstanding definitely going back again"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. The food was not good. I ordered the Blue Cheeseburger and it was greasy.  I ordered the burger medium well but it was undercooked. The Truffle Parmesan Fries tasted like death. The only reason why I gave it a two star is because the Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake was good."}
{"text":"We came here because all the buffets were closed. Didn't expect anything and chose it just because of Gordon Ramsay's name and we were blown away. The wait was a bit long but it was still dinner hours so definitely understandable. The service was fantastic; the waiters walked us the through the menu and made sure that everyone was heard (we were a pretty sizable party). At one point, someone in my group shattered their water glass and the situation was dealt with quickly and efficiently. Moving onto the food, I had one of the specials which was a burger boasting three different kinds of pig and it was honestly one of the best burgers I'd ever had. Definitely really hearty and I wasn't able to finish it but I'd come again for another attempt. If you're going to come though, you have to try their shakes; in particular the creme brulee shake is to die for. I've recommended Burger to many of my friends and will be making stops here whenever I go to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Just had the burger with the egg and bacon. So so good! Meat was cooked perfectly. Egg was done just right and the bacon brought it home. Can't say anything bad about it. I've always wanted to try a burger like this. Glad I tried it here. Wasn't disappointed. Overall place was very nice. Definitely busy. Our server was good but it did take him some time to get our stuff. For instance my husband ordered a coke and when it came for a refill it took forever for him to get it to us. We were already done with the meal when he brought it. Other then that I really enjoyed it. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a burger in Vegas. It's relatively cheap and the arrive is friendly. There is usually a wait and you pay for fries separately. However, the presentation, atmosphere and taste is excellent."}
