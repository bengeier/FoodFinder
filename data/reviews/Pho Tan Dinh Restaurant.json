{"text":"Had the Hu Tieu with bbq pork, seafood and wonton, with the soup on side. It was delicious. It was $10 but the portion was very large. It tasted fresh , the squid, imitation crab meat, seafood ball were all good. Would def eat hu tieu here again."}
{"text":"The previous restaurant used to be a good local Vietnamese restaurant, but ever since the place switched owners a few months ago, this place does not stack up.

I ordered take out, lemongrass grilled chicken on rice with two sides of beef soup. A real Vietnamese restaurant would give you the soup as part of the rice order but I had to pay for it.

The chicken had no lemongrass, it was super salty and doused in soy sauce. The rice did not come with the fish sauce that is supposed to be standard. The soup was very salty and did not come with the standard onions and scallions. Just plain beef broth loaded with MSG, it appeared. I don't want to know what their pho tastes like.

I didn't even get utensils or napkins!

I will have to find a new Pho restaurant to go to locally. Not ever going back to this place."}
{"text":"I don't know why the ratings are so low. 
My coworkers come here all the time so I gave it a try.  I had very good Pho.  And the iced coffee is excellent.
Everyone in our party of 7 enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time last week after looking for a Pho restaurant in the area when shopping. When it came down to it the Pho and the Vietnamese coffee were good, however, 2 of our main courses were not as tasty as we were hoping for unfortunately. I myself ordered a curry chicken which was gloopy to say the least and my significant other was also disappointed by her vermicelli dish in which the noodles were not properly cooked. 

I don't think I will be visiting back anytime soon considering the other options in the area."}
{"text":"We came here this evening for take out. The resturant was very tastefully decorated and was very clean. All the tables were empty, no one was in there eating, and we were about to find out why. We ordered our food, went shopping. Came back 15 minutes later to pick the food up. The food was very poorly packaged. They put very very very hot soup under a container of heavy noodles - the soup container buckled because the plastic got so hot and the soup ended up spilling in the bottom of the bag. 
When we got home we opened everything up. My boyfriend got spicy chicken soup. The soup had spilled in the bottom of the bag, so he took what was left and poured it into a bowl. The chicken and noodles came in another container. The chicken was just small pieces that were boiled, there was no seasoning on them at all. He said the soup was bland and boring, well what he got to eat of it. Most of it was still in the bottom of the bag. 
I got pork vermicelli. I couldn't even eat the pork. It was seasoned with some kind of lemon/lime seasoning that gave it the taste of cleaning products. Either that or they cleaned the grill because it was the end of the night and then made my pork before wiping it off properly. But the fake citrus taste was disgusting. I completely lost my appetite. Well at least I can still eat the spring roll right? Wrong. I took a bite and was overwhelmed by the taste of black pepper. I instantly spit the piece back out and was horrified. I am extremely disappointed. Complete waste of $30. With money being tight right now, I am not happy at all. Looks like cereal for dinner tonight. Yum Yum."}
