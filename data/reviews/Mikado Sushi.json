{"text":"At first service was a little slow because they were busy. When we received our meal though none of that mattered. The presentation was amazing and once we bit into the sushi all four adults agreed it was the best sushi we had ever had. Our favorite had to be the checker board, the tuna melted in our mouth like butter. Even the kids loved their chicken cutlets and Udon noodles. From now on we will definitely be making the drive from Casa Grande to Mikado for our sushi."}
{"text":"We a group of 4 were seated at a booth. They brought our drinks and told us they had a party of 8 that walked in an we needed to move to a small table. How rude is that. They just wanted the 18% gratuity at the cost of loosing customers. They did not ask kindly they just wanted us to move. Unreal to be treated this way. I guess we will never go back."}
{"text":"Best sushi that I've found in the Chandler area since moving here a couple years ago. Reasonable prices and good quality, friendly service too."}
{"text":"One of the few Japanese restaurants that has tonkatsu ramen!
There's one waitress who's a regular that's really nice & awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place and I'm their customer since 2012. 
When I miss sushi l always come here. 
Tusy is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised. The food was better than expected for the simple decor, and the service was very patient, helpful, and friendly, versus the highly reserved treatment we're used to getting at sushi restaurants.

We ordered off the lunch menu and I chose the 2 choice combo.  I ordered teriyaki chicken and seaweed salad.  My husband ordered the 4 choice combo and chose teriyaki chicken and three sushi choices.  Both meals came with good miso soup and white rice.


The teriyaki chicken was a generous portion, moist, and not swimming in sauce. The sauce was not too sweet, which we liked, and was just the right amount of salt.  The seaweed salad was fresh and the best I've had in a long time.  My husband says the himachi was watery and not a good clean flavor, a tiny bit fishy, and maybe frozen too long.  But even so, he'd order it again for the price point.  We've found fresh sushi in Arizona to be super expensive!

We gave our experience 4 stars even though it wasn't the best food, because the food was good, the price was right, and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the busiest day of the year but the service was horrible. 12 minutes before anyone even came to our table and beverages were always empty. 

The sushi was just okay. Feels like due to thanksgiving, shipping fresh fish was backed up. The salmon was mushy and the flavor was light."}
{"text":"Pretty decent and fresh sushi, for AZ. Prices are great, especially during happy hour. It's a little more expensive than other sushi places in the area, but still affordable. Expect to pay approx $20 per person for a full meal (appetizer plus entree or a couple of rolls/nigiri)"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Chandler from Seattle and were doubting that we would find a good sushi place.  Mikado is great!  We were pleasantly surprised at how good the rolls are.  The lunch specials are a great deal and they also have a good happy hour in the late afternoon."}
{"text":"Go here for freshly made sushi - which is also delicious - and for very reasonable prices!
 
I go here at least once a week when I am not travelling and would recommend to anyone in the Chandler/Ocotillo area."}
{"text":"I've been over 100 times for lunch. The lunch combinations are fantastic and the teriyaki is delicious. I would have given 5 stars but the last several times I've been in for lunch they are tremendously under-staffed. Don't get me wrong, the servers a re great and working their tails off but ownership needs to stop being cheap and recognize that they need 1-2 more servers during peak hours. I haven't been recently because often I'm on a tight time schedule for lunch and can't risk it. Again, the food is great and the staff is very friendly. If you hit it when it's not busy it's definitely a five star lunch destination!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place and would come weekly.  My wife is a regular here and has in the past thought very highly of Mikado.

Lately the food quality has dropped quite a bit and the service has suffered.  We aren't sure if we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Hands Down The BEST!!
We are there at least 3x a week. We frequent the place so much for over the past 3 years my son who's 4 calls our sushi chef Troy & waitstaff Jen  & Soo\"Auntie Jenn & Soo, then Uncle Troy\" they are always on top their game and make sure we're getting nothing but the BEST!! They truly have become family and I can't imagine going any other place!!! Thank You Jenn, Soo, and Troy!!! You have such a happy little family here and KayKay is blessed to have his aunties & uncle so close!!!"}
{"text":"Mikado is about 2 minutes away from our house which is the main reason why my boyfriend and I frequent it so much, but the sushi is also fabulous. The fish is very fresh (we are huge fans of the albacore onion sashimi) and the rolls are really good too. We tend to get more rolls than nigiri but both never disappoint. It's not the biggest restaurant inside but we've never had an issue getting a table- we usually sit at the same one :). We have never had bad sushi at this place which is why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Excellent deals for happy hour.  The vegetable tempura, miso soup, salad, beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, california rolls, and crunch rolls were very good.  The spicy tuna was a little bland. Our children even enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"At the corner of Alma School Rd & Queen Creek Rd, there are two sushi restaurants. Mikado and Hon Machi. Let's just say once you tried Mikado, Hon Machi looks like a pretender. Unless of course if you like Teppanyaki, then Hon Machi is the place to go.

Tip: if you go on a Friday night, reach there before 6:15pm, most likely it will be full house after that. 

Don't forget to check out the specials on their white board. For the past three months (Jan to Mar) they are serving the rare bluefin tuna sashimi, which is excellent!

If you don't care for sashimi, they have tons of rolls you can choose from. My favorite is the spider roll (Deep fried soft-shell crab). Or you can go more conservative by getting the 2/3/4-item dinner combo, pick from 'cooked' items like beef/chicken/salmon terriyaki, gyoza, etc.

I think in the Chandler area, Mikado is the best sushi place you can go to. IMHO, the other sushi restaurant in AZ that is better is Kyoto at Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Mikado is a wonderful little sushi joint. I highly, highly, highly recommend the caterpillar roll, miso soup, chicken teriyaki and vegetable tempura. Everything is very tasty."}
{"text":"Went here last night and had a great time. We arrived right before happy hour and ordered the mixed tempura and 5 different rolls. The mixed tempura was good, nothing special. It consisted of mostly root vegetables and also a couple of pieces of shrimp. All of the rolls were very good. The standouts to me were the crunch roll and the kimchi roll. We also had beer and soju with our meal, which was also very reasonably priced, especially compared to some of the more \"trendy\" places like Ra or Stingray. 

The wait service was pretty good throughout the evening. They came by often to check on us, but they were never too overbearing which I liked. I would definitely recommend Mikado to anyone in Chandler. It is a very good alternative to the other higher-priced sushi joints in the valley."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in the SW Valley.  I recommend the White Fish & Alaska roll.  Very good and a good price too!"}
{"text":"I'm completely baffled on how this got the better review then the  Sushi Room a.k.a. Rock Lobster. We were trying to step out of the box I'm going back in the box. 

The wait staff was very friendly. 

The food was absolutely disgusting. I kind of felt bad because they were nice so we just told them we were full and took it to go. I threw it away in the garbage outside the restaurant and drove to Rock Lobster for takeout. I will not make that mistake again. 

The sushi was so big I couldn't put it in my mouth and it fell apart!  It just tasted terrible plus there was no flavor. I have nothing more to say."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Service was poop.  Called in to go order at 11:55am.  They said 20 min.  Arrived at 12:20pm.  Actually received food at 12:57pm.  Lunch hour burned waiting.  YMMV."}
{"text":"I've been a Mikado fan for a few years and at one point was eating here every other week with my family.  Prior to being introduced to this place, I was going all the way to Ahwahtukee to get my sushi fix at Sakana, but it wasn't as regular as it is now due to the price difference and proximity from home here in Chandler.  

I enjoy the atmosphere, the sushi, and even the sometimes slow service.  You will definitely get quality food at a great price (especially during HH).  I am completely addicted to their Crunch Roll - no one else around serves it like they do - OH SO YUMMY!  I also can't do without my Miso soup or side salad with the ginger dressing - another addiction. 

I always recommend this place to friends and family for lunch or dinner.  Mikado is EXTREMELY busy on Friday evenings and most Saturdays.  

Happy sushi eating fellow foodies!"}
{"text":"My review is specifically on the quality of the sushi. And thats very good!
Broad selection of interesting and creative rolls. Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"In my opinion, a good sushi experience relies heavily on subtleties.  First up, room temperature & vibe.  We were greeted and sat in a corner booth near a window.  Within 1 minute we realized it was hot so we decided to move to an adjacent booth situated under a ceiling fan.  We were promptly told that they might have to move us in case a large party arrived.  I guess I get that.  Seeing the room was 90% empty, I told her half joking that they would have to wait a few minutes since it was our 18th anniversary. Blank stare retort.  Room temp/vibe - FAIL.  Next up, drinks.  An ice cold Sapporo is sort of my go-to with sushi.  It was cold-ish, not co-o-o-ollld. My wife's wine was fine.  Drinks - Meh.  Next up, Appetizers.  Salad - great, miso soup - great, shrimp tempura....wha? More like Sam's club breaded longish shrimp.  We were not served shrimp tempura but I didn't make a fuss since they tasted pretty good.  Edamame were barely warm.  Appetizers - FAIL.  Next up, Entrees.  The rolls were really good, Rainbow, Boston.  Salmon and tuna nigri were really good too. Yellow tail was not.  My wife had beef teriyaki which she said was not good, bland.  Entrees-GOOD!. (I have to cancel out the teriyaki, cuz this is a sushi place.) I can forgive the low par yellow tail too, we ARE in the desert. They really should not have served it, though.  Oh, our server was super nice but not personable or genuine, almost too nice. She did a good job.  Service - GOOD.

Overall, not bad.  I have been here before for carry out rolls and will likely come back for that vs dine in.  I think a little focus could make this quaint place a gem.  They just missed the mark in a few important areas."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how long this location has been here, but since finding out about it a few weeks ago, i've been there twice.

This is definitely a place to go to when you want some quick, cheap, great tasting sushi. This is a no-fuss place. It's clean, and small, and you can get in and out quickly. 

While i am a fan of this place, i don't recommend it for date night--just not that type of atmosphere. 

Happy Hour prices are great, but even regularly priced menu items are far better priced than any other local spot i've found--with the great taste to go with it!

I definitely recommend giving this place a chance!"}
{"text":"Wow - reading some of the reviews make me sad that people were treated so poorly at Mikado. 

Mikado has been our go to spot for sushi in south chandler. Their service isn't outstanding, but I typically don't go to sushi restaurants for great service (which is weird, because I am really really picky about getting great service when I am out to eat). Anyhow - the sushi is great, it is decently priced, and I have never been yelled at by the staff (so that is a plus!). 

But in all seriousness, we will keep going to Mikado. I love sushi and they have several non-sushi options for my non-sushi-eating-husband."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant based on Yelp reviews.  It did not disappoint. Our food was fresh and tasty!  The staff was very friendly and seemed to know a lot of their customers by name. We will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried many different Sushi places  around the valley and this one is by far on the top. The freshest quality fish around the valley! The wait staff is pleasurable and on top of things as well. I have recommended this sushi place to numerous of people and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"The BOMB..........sushi in Chandler does not get any better than this."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Fantastic service & even better food.  If you love sushi, give Mikado a go! 

P.S.  Tell Sue hi!"}
{"text":"I crave this sushi place. I always taste so fresh and yummy. The staff is always so helpful and gracious! The only thing that needs work is the outside patio. It look vacant. By adding tables and chairs or even trees would make it look inviting!"}
{"text":"Love this place~went to happy hour and the prices were amazing, 3.95 for most items and the mixed tempura was a super large portion with two large shrimps! I had the crunch roll and tempura shrimp roll, to die for!  Can get really crowded at the sushi bar but everyone is so friendly so going by yourself is very comfortable. Look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Average for what it is. I was highly disappointed, the sushi was OK at best, fresh but not really anything special. What really peeved me off was the Shrimp Tempura Udon I ordered here. They brought me the soup and all it had was dehydrated mushrooms, normally I get a lot more variety in my Udon. Secondly, while the veggies were tempura fried, the shrimp that they brought me was absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. 2 long pieces of what seemed to be pre-frozen shrimp battered in fish stick crumbs that you get out of a Gorton's frozen fish box. Terrible. Was so shocked. Giving this place 2 stars because of the tempura shrimp and annoying service (had to flag down the waiter every time we needed something, which wasn't often, but still, waited 15 minutes after we asked for our check before tehy even brought it to us.)"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed with their food. We tried a variety of their rolls and nothing stood out. Sakana's still the best!"}
{"text":"I have never been treated so badly by staff/manager in my life. I ordered a kirin (tasty) 2 rolls and veg tempura. The spicy salmon was AWFUL. It was huge chunks of old salmon with mayo. I tried to politely tell the server i didnt like it when the sushi chef sat and argued with me that he had made it that way for 11 years and no one has complained. Long story short, when I got my bill they had not taken it off even tho I ate ONE PIECE. They said they would not take it off because everyone else likes it and thats too bad. I was appalled. I told them they would either take it off now or I would walk out. They took it off and threw the bill at me. I cannot believe staff can treat ppl this way. I plan on filing a complaint with the BBB. Their sushi case was leaking and the fish did not look good, I suppose a surprise visit from the Dept of Health might shake them up a bit. I will NEVER go back to this hole in the wall again! Terrible experience"}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place. Especially for the price, it's hard to beat. Their lunch special is a great deal--like 12 bucks for a filling meal, and it's all tasty. Service can get slow when it's slammed, but I usually get my food pretty fast. Great food, usually good service. I've been disappointed by a lot of sushi places, but this one hasn't let me down yet."}
{"text":"As far as AZ sushi goes this is middle of the road.  Kudos for some of the creative rolls and friendly service. Quality of food left a lot to be desired though."}
{"text":"LOVE Mikado! They have fresh sushi at a great price.  They are always busy so the waitresses aren't the friendliest, but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit this place in my travels this week and it was great.  The pricing for lunch (specials) was fantastic, especially for what you get.  I had teriyaki Salmon, ahi tuna rolls, and 2 orders of Yellowtail Sashimi for $12.95.  What a deal!  And the server was VERY accommodating.  And the food was good.  The Sashimi wasn't the highest, highest quality grade, but very good, especially for what I paid for everything!  I haven't been there during normal times or tried their normal menus but I will definitely come back.  

The lunch specials allow you to order 2, 3 or 4 different things in kind of a make-shift \"Bento box\" for a very reasonable price.  I'm really happy I went and look forward to coming back to Phoenix/Chandler, in part so I can revisit these guys.

Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for traditional sushi. I love the 1,2 or 3 item Bento boxes. Always fresh. Always friendly. Not over priced, crazy roll combinations. Just good sushi. Would go there just for the ginger salad dressing."}
{"text":"Best sushi experience I have had in the valley.  

The sushi was real good and constructed well.

The prices were very reasonable.  

The service was very kind and accomidating.

I would choose this establishment over any other sushi bar in the valley.

The dinner and lunch specials are awesome.  A bento box with your choice of 2, 3, or 4 entrees and miso soup."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time and it was absolutely delicious. It's a small place but the food was delicious and fresh! We came on a Saturday night and there was no wait at all. Their prices are very competitive also. This place was by far our favorite sushi place we've tried so far."}
{"text":"The service was so bad, we never even got to order. The waitress asked for our order after about 5 minutes but we weren't quite ready and she never came back despite our attempts to get her attention. 20 minutes later we left and as soon as we were out the door she was cleaning up our table. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great sushi and service.  I have dinner here a couple times per week.  Very consistent quality and service.   Staff will remember your name.  Love the blue fin tuna and other items that are brought in special.  Restaurant decor isn't great, but food is excellent."}
{"text":"We used to love this place but we went and the staff has changed! We used to have a great waitress now we had a lady that didn't understand our order and brought the wrong food to the table. We asked for the manager and nobody came. The food was subpar so we paid and left! We WON'T BE BACK!"}
{"text":"THIS IS BASED ON PHILLY ROLL ONLY.

Its what I crave when I want sushi and have ordered it quite a few places in the valley. i usually like it here best. especially compared to the place across the street in the sprouts plaza.

Service is always quick and friendly.

yummy yummy philly roll."}
{"text":"Very good fresh sushi! This place restored my faith in AZ sushi houses, the only thing that's preventing me from giving them 5 stars is their rolls aren't bite sized.  Will definitely become a regular here :)"}
{"text":"Mikado can be hit or miss, but tonight was a hit. I always love their chicken teriyaki... all white meat and the sauce is not overpowering. Sometimes the vegetable tempura can be greasy, but this time it was light and crunchy (don't get the shrimp tempura, as it is just frozen fried shrimp. I'm not sure why they don't use fresh and fry it in the same batter they use for the veggies). We've always had good, friendly service here and typically dine there every 2-3 months. It's great for a casual dinner out with the family."}
{"text":"Mikado is my favorite sushi place in the Chandler/Gilbert area.  The fish is AMAZING and they often have really great stuff in, like blue fin, etc.  The chefs are really good and often make me special things that aren't on the menu.  The nigiri portions are very generous. 
This is one of the two or three places where I try the specialty rolls, the albacore and garlic roll is awesome.  Also they have specialty sashimi that you should really try if you go.  Another winner is the tempura and garlic app, the deep fried garlic is actually sweet and mellow, very nice.
The atmosphere is nice and the staff is VERY friendly, and the prices are totally reasonable.  Like I said before, my favorite sushi spot anywhere near me."}
{"text":"Awful service! I used to come her back in 2010 when it was new, the food and staff were awsome! I recently came back and the staff is all new. One word... RUDE. Our waitress seemed pestered when id ask for a refill or when id place another order. Like, um, sorry to bother you at work lady? The food was good, but theres a ton of other sushi places in the east valley with the same grade of food and better service. Its a shame this place shot to shi*, could have been a real gem."}
{"text":"First visit here - great service and food.  The sashimi was fresh and the portions were large.  Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of a strip mall, Mikado sushi was pretty easy to find. The restaurant was about 35% filled during lunchtime. There is ample seating for groups in booths, tables, and the sushi bar. They also have a multitude of LCD screens playing sports and other tv shows. The background music was an energetic retro 90s beat on Utopia radio. 

My servers were very courteous and took my order quickly. They have great lunch deals here. Pick 2 for ~$8, Pick 3 for ~$10
I got the mixed tempura, chicken teriyaki and salmon sashimi which also comes with white rice and miso soup. 

My food was out in less than 10 mins. I was impressed with the quality of the salmon sashimi. It was very fresh and a vibrant orange. I have seen in the past how some sushi bars have tried to pawn off pale orange salmon as fresh when it's clearly been frozen and defrosted. The mixed tempura was lightly battered with just the right amount of crunch. Lastly, the chicken teriyaki was tender and scrumptious. Getting the 3 combo was just the right amount for me. This is definitely a great place to go to get some fresh fish!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Chandler. Only place I've found that keeps their quality the same all the time. I get basic sushi but absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi and fast, friendly service.

Sushi was fresh and delicious, only downside was that some of the tuna was a bit tough!"}
{"text":"We are regulars at Mikado.  I like to go Friday nights, though it does tend to get very busy and the wait is much longer (not like 20min+ wait, though).  Even so, the service is still friendly and their sushi is *always* tasty, fresh, and inventive (I like to order the chef's creation.. changes every time and is usually something not on the menu). I do like their lunch specials, too, and I like to occasionally go with co-workers for lunch (though, if it's a big group and we arrive at noon, it does take significantly longer to get done with dinner).  I have sat several times at the bar (with a friend or just alone) and I love that service - the sushi chefs are always friendly, jovial, and like to make light conversation.. plus, you get to see them make the orders.  One time, I forgot my wallet and realized this AFTER I had eaten and got the bill - the owners were there and since they knew I was a regular, she said not to worry about it - I felt mortified!  I said thank you for their kindness and left home quickly (I lived really close at that time) and got my cash and left a huge tip.. but that just shows you what type of people they are that own the place - kind people!  Let's just say they still remember me years later!"}
{"text":"There are other sushi restaurants out there that have more options.  The sushi here was good but it is a competing industry and they are just even with the rest not a stand out."}
{"text":"I'm picky about textures of food that I eat so it is surprising to me that I'd like sushi as much as I do.

I've eaten sushi all over the place. I am confident in saying that I like Mikado the best. Their rolls are good sized (some places have really small rolls!) and taste great. The chefs are great too.

Almost every time I've gone I've had someone sit next to me that is a regular and swears by Mikado sushi.

So what is the bad? Sometimes when you walk in the staff is not super active at seating you. If you want to sit at the bar, then just walk over and sit down. If you want a seat then walk over to the register (it is only like 15 feet from the door in plain sight) and ask if it is OK if you sit at whatever booth/table you like. The staff all works together so when you sit at a table you will be served by all the chefs and all the servers - and thusly you will be tipping all of them collectively. So for this reason, it really doesn't matter where you sit! I'm not saying to just sit wherever, I'm just saying be proactive. It helps you and it helps them.

My favorite roll is the Crunch Roll, which you can get for cheap during happy hour (until 6pm). During HH I can get 2-3 rolls and a tea for about $12. Outside of HH it will be more like $18-20. Also, the menu has pictures of all their food (well, 90% of their food), so you can kind of browse that way too if you like to look at what you are buying.

So if you want to be waited on hand in foot and have a restaurant that looks like a million dollars then this is not the place for you. However, if you want good sushi, then this is the place. If you are curious about something, then ask them what they think. I see many of the regulars asking all the time what is fresh and good and the chefs will be very honest about what is good and bad and they will order/serve accordingly. Also, the most you come the more you will become \"family\" to them. You will start to get samples, especially if you sit at the bar and chat with the chefs.

There you have it... the best sushi place I've been too and better yet, it is close enough for me to walk to!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Phoenix. Staff is quick and nice. The sushi is really simple. They don't add extra that doesn't need to be there. And very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This was the second sushi visit in one day for me, so I was really in the mood. I had heard good things about Mikado, but had never been.

We ordered tuna, yellowtail, and salmon nigiri, a angry cucumber salad (which was described as \"spicy\"), a kimchi roll, and eel nigiri.

The tuna was mealy in texture, the yellowtail was fine, and the salmon was okay. The cucumber salad was okay, but not as described. The kimchi rolls didn't really taste anything like kimchi, just cabbage-y, and the eel rolls were good, but needed more sauce.

And it took the staff a bit of time to greet us when we walked in.

Nothing was bad with the exception of the tuna, but nothing was really outstanding either. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Their lunch are definitely cheap but you pretty much get what you pay for. The place is actually run by Korean people not Japanese. The food is okay but not what I was expecting given the reviews on Yelp. We had the albacore with onions, spicy yellow sushi, spicy tuna sushi, tempura, and katsu. The only things that tasted decent were the spicy yellow tail sushi, tempura, and katsu. I guess 3/5 isn't that bad. But I probably wouldn't get anything raw from them again in the summer. The fish just did not taste fresh and left a gross aftertaste in your mouth afterwards. It was definitely disappointing and did not fulfill my sushi crave. I would actually only give them a 2.5/5 but I decided to round up."}
{"text":"Wow. Chandler folk don't know what good sushi is. This place was gross. All of our rolls were so fishy tasting. I had to send my dynamite roll back because it not only smelled terrible but the taste was unbearable. My kids had chicken teriyaki and they couldn't even get that right, how do you mess that up?!? I will never ever go back. Yuck!"}
{"text":"We found our go-to spot for sushi! My husband and I went to Mikado on a whim and we are incredibly happy we found it. After moving to Chandler from FL, we left behind our favorite sushi joint and their unique rolls. MIkado is cozy and comfortable with incredibly friendly(and funny!) staff. The menu provides detailed descriptions of all sushi and pictures for almost each item as well. We ordered the california roll, shrimp tempura roll, philly roll. veggie tempura roll, and crunch roll and they arrived on a sushi boat. The rice was cooked to perfection, the fish at the perfect temperature, and everything was very fresh. In addition, the eel sauce was fantastic, with the perfect amount of sweetness. We left behind(in FL) our favorite roll, with tempura sweet potato. We were delighted to find this veggie tempura roll at Mikado with tempura sweet potato, squash, and asparagus. Prices were average for sushi (around 5-8 per roll) and worth every penny. Those who say it is expensive must be ordering all 8 dollar rolls or they frequent Teharu (a local sushi place with a conveyor belt), whose sushi is cheap.....but not fresh, imaginative, or good.  I have had sushi all across the country and Mikado kicks all of these restaurant's butts. A must try! :)"}
{"text":"Really tiny little sushi place that is great for nearby lunch on my breaks, but the sizing of the lunch specials are really small - maybe I just eat more than the normal person?? It just feels like when I get anything less than a 3 item combo, I am still hungry, the meat proportion especially.

Sushi is fresh, but think the salad should be included for free ($1.00), since it's mainly just lettuce. Rice could have been better scooped or selected since portions were hard (as if it was burnt in some areas). I guess that's why the pricing is good, but would really like to see better proportions. More like 3.5 stars, but the staff is friendly and explained the lunch options, so it'll be rounded up."}
{"text":"SO SAD!!!!  Decided to try lunch combo instead of individual sashimi.  Choice of 4 items $15 - prebreaded, overcooked shrimp passing as tempura, deep fried mystery gyoza, four very thin pieces of each red snapper and yellow tail.  Left gyoza after one bite - filling was green onion and mush that tasted like corn starch.  Hey, I can buy cheapest frozen gyoza and fry them!!  Maybe people who have never been to real Japanese restaurant like wads of gummy rice stuck on seaweed with questionable filling and a bunch of sauce on top like this place.  If you do, knock yourself out.  If not, head downtown to Hana with me!"}
{"text":"LET ME START...by saying this, I used to give Mikado 5 stars.
They have lost a lot of points with me for several reasons.

I've been going to mikado for 6 years, they make delicious tempura and the sashimi is also very good. The food quality is not in question, it is almost always good and what you want exactly. My problem with mikado is now their service...What happened to it?

The last 4 times I have come to mikado, I had either a server who didn't know what they were doing, a server who ignored our table, or a server who forgot every single thing I asked for. The service has gone downhill, to the point it really ticked us off.

The last time my friend and I went to mikado it was a regular weeknight, no crowd, it wasn't packed, so there was no reason for slow, crumby service. We ordered sashimi, that is uncooked, sliced fish, for some reason it took 40 minutes to get our sashimi, but the tempura came out first within 2 minutes. Dishes came out at odd times, and honestly, the main course was sashimi, it took forever to get it when it usually took 10. The last time it also took longer than usual. Okay, no huge offense, the uncooked, cold fish that takes 10 seconds to slice took 40 minutes, I looked past that. What ticked me off? I reach for the bill, my friend and I split it, we tell the server half on mine, and half on hers...simple enough right? I get home after dinner and my card is charged twice. Also during this dinner we were told the computers were down. I had to go back the next day and explain everything, because they couldn't help me over the phone. Annoying stuff.

Seriously, clean up your act mikado! You guys make good food, don't let your confusing, slow, messy service ruin it.

Mikado needs to hire an experienced server and train the others how to take care of business. This is a great neighborhood place, it needs to take care of its long time guests with better service."}
{"text":"hands down the best sushi in the city. The portions and quility of the sushi are the best in the city. I would of given this a 5 star but the service sucked."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Consistently good food--seemingly regardless of what I order.  Sushi and non-sushi are both really good.  Reasonably priced.  Big portions.  Definitely the best sushi I've had in SoCha."}
{"text":"We have eaten a Mikado a few times now for lunch and have been impressed each and every time. They have a very large sushi menu as well as regular menu items. Their lunch specials are pretty good although there are no veggie options on there so it doesn't usually help me out. However, I have had the veggie tempura roll, avocado roll and shitake mushroom roll. All have been delicious and I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This is the only place we go for sushi. It is a small little place, that we luckily found. We have tried a few of the bigger places around, but haven't found anywhere we love as much. It is usually pretty full, because it is so small. Yet, we never have to wait too long. We love the food, drinks, staff, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like Sushi, and this place rocks. The food selection was very large.....sometimes this could be a problem, when the menu is so diverse that someone like myself has a hard time choosing. 

I went with the dragon roll, and the spicy tuna rolls. By far this has been the best Sushi that I have had in some time.

The atmosphere is nice, the food was fantastic, the service was good...YES, I will come back when in town again."}
{"text":"The Sushi was fab!!  We had some specialty rolls and Shashimi, both were very melt in your mouth fresh!

Service was a bit slow as I think they only had 2 waitresses for the entire place.

Cost seemed to be very reasonable.

Would certainly make the drive from South Scottsdale there again!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is delicious and very inexpensive! Their sushi has a more authentic and classic look than say at RA where they are so perfected and glamourized with sauces and things. We tried the shrimp tempura, spicy tuna roll, spicy yellowtail and the chicken teryaki - everything is so good! Even the edamame here is the best I've tried anywhere.

The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and very genuine! They are very knowledgeable of the menu and take the time to layout the menu and describe what they offer. Their drink menu looks great too. 

The only downside is, the atmosphere is very plain, small and casual. Better for a quick weekday night/ casual meal out. 

Definitely try it out! :)"}
{"text":"Great spot!! Found this place just on a whim and it worked out great. Best place I have found in AZ. James is awesome and from New York the Sushi Chef, totally cool and we will be back"}
{"text":"We use to eat here all the time. But now each time we come it has progressively gotten worst. Rolls made wrong. Forgotten rolls. And now as we sit here drinks empty and no service people in sight to even bring us our check. The place isn't busy. It's us and two other tables for a Saturday night. It's too bad because they use to be great."}
{"text":"I was lured here by the good yelp reviews.

Husband and I got the sashimi plate to test its fish quality. Salmon and tuna were good, but not great because the pieces were not thawed properly when served. The other types of fish - yellow tail, mackerel, white fish - were too fishy and chewy. Husband didn't quite like the octopus and squid because of the texture. We didn't finish all the sashimi.

I got an eel roll. It fell apart. It didn't pass my rice test.

Good as a neighborhood sushi place. But not worth the drive from Tempe."}
{"text":"Was in town for a night and was craving sushi.  Came here because there was not much choice in the yelp area.  It was ok.  Everything that looked good on the menu was just OK.  Maybe it is good for Chandler sushi?  meh"}
{"text":"Sushi is my families fav. Someone recommended this place as a good place in south chandler. Yuk! I usually always over eat when we go to sushi. I could not even finish this. It was just so bland and not appetizing. We've had sushi all over the valley....maybe I'm a harsh critic or picky, but we will not be returning. 
   Also, the waitress spilled water on the tile floor while refilling our water and didn't bother to clean it up. They were not busy. She knew. It was too much for me to wipe up w/just napkins. So I put the baby on my hip and had the kids carefully walk around it when we left."}
{"text":"I don't even wants give one star. This is the worse eating experience ever I had. I felt really bad about this restaurant, the waiter is not only miss our orders and give us his attitude. The restaurant is only have three table while we eating there. We tried to spoke to the manager about the situation but the waiter said he is the manager. Lol what a joke, serious?! If so, I felt sad about the restaurant's owner. I used to go this place a lot but after today I won't recommending this place to anyone and I won't back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is always great.  Nice warm atmosphere The people working there very friendly. My family tends to go for the combos which allow you to have a 2-4 choices out of  4 columns of items, involving teriyaki, sushi rolls, sashimi, and other items along with soup, rice, and salad. My teen-aged daughter had me take her and 3 of her friends there to celebrate her birthday, because it is her favorite place. They had a great time and the waitress gave one of her friends \"training wheel chopsticks\" (and a fork) when she wasn't keeping up with the others.   Nice warm atmosphere.  They are a small restaurant that sometimes gets overwhelmed by its own popularity, so we have had slow service while trying to handle a big rush.Customer base seems to vary greatly... I have seen days where it was all familys with lots of kids, and college students some visits,  and on other evening visits saw couples on dates, socializing drinkers at the sushi bar,  and a big group of business people on a business trip.  As I said, it is a great little place."}
{"text":"I think this is the best sushi in Chandler.  The prices are great and the sushi is fresh and delish!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Arizona! The staff is friendly and they are reasonably priced. Try the seaweed salad its amazing!"}
{"text":"Good menu. Good variety. Wonderful appetizer selection. Love the sashimi plates. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we didn't have a great dining experience.  The service was slow but the portions were large.  I ordered the udon and it lacked everything.  The salmon teriyaki and pork cutlet were better.  They charge you for hot tea that tastes like hot water."}
{"text":"We loved the sushi is this place. So delicious. Dragon roll, tuna xtuna and Las Vegas our favorite"}
{"text":"Awful, slow service. Hot entrees come out 10 minutes before the sushi or vice versa. Fish is far from fresh and often tough. Rolls are not creative. Hot food is always hit or miss. 

Come for the lunch special, it's affordable and you can't go wrong-- it's hard to mess up a California role and tempura. 

Do yourself a favor and skip dinner."}
{"text":"I had the spicy salmon roll and calamari for lunch and the service was good- granted there was only one other guy in the restaurant. I ordered my food to go because I had to get to work and the lady who helped me was quick and efficient. I had placed my order within 5 minutes of being there. As I looked around however, the ambiance of the place just threw me off. There were a lot of cat statues and very few portraits and the whole place just felt like it was fake. Also, the music was just regular radio music, at least if you are going to be fake Japanese, place old Japanese music or something. I got my food in a timely manner, though. When I tried my salmon roll I was surprised to find it wasn't too bad. I would never eat it on a regular basis, but they made it tolerable. I usually don't get sick from fish, but, after eating the salmon roll, I felt very nauseous. I didn't throw up, but I felt like crap for the remainder of the day. I don't know if that was just the sushi or directly because of Mikado, so I felt like that was worth mentioning."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place on a Saturday morning, this place is very slow, sitting down during the rush hours for almost 2 hours, only two customers including us.  The food was pretty normal, we used to go out alot for Japanese food, this place wasnt outstanding at all. service was so so.  prices was kinda cheap for Japanese food, but portion are kinda small too.

Overall, nothing special about this place, I might come back, but it wont be often."}
{"text":"I travel for work and have recently discovered Yelp and found this sushi restaurant.  Fabulous sushi and sashimi...just the perfect temp and melt-in-your-mouth taste.  The staff are very friendly and efficient.  I came back a second time because it was that good.  Thanks for those who gave it 4 stars!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Chirashi bowl for takeout to try this place out. Looks like they used to have outdoor seating at one time. Was questioning my choice as I walked in since they werent very busy at all at 12:20 on a Monday. The fish tasted very fresh, and the portion size was appropriate, although they did charge me for extra masago (i asked for it) but I didnt really see extra. (Perhaps they dont put masago on it usually?) Overall it was 25 bucks (including tip). Kinda pricey imo, since most places charge aprox 15 to 17 for a chirashi bowl. They did include salad and miso soup (even with takeout) which was nice. The Miso soup was delicious."}
{"text":"This place could be a 4 or 5, but for 2 reasons.

1.  Food - Very decent fish and sushi rolls and all.  I stopped here for lunch and ordered their lunch combo, the sashimi and sushi were all very good, but the rice that came with the chicken cutlet was not.  Its hard and tasted like it was day old and probably from the bottom of the rice cooker.  Its a damn shame as the food alone would have gotten them 4 star but, its like serving caviar on a paper plate.  Some restaurants seem to do that, use good ingredients but try to save by using either lower grade rice or old one.  

My friend mentioned that maybe the rice was just badly cooked, without enough water, to which I would say a 1 star deduction is justified.  Please, a japanese restaurant not able to cook rice is like going to a burger place and getting burnt buns or a italian restaurant having hard pasta.  Its just wrong. 

2.  Service - They need to hire someone else to work here.  The owner and her daughter are not fast enough for even an average lunch crowd, 50 percent full at the time I was there.  And when you ask your customer if the food was good, and they reflect that the rice was hard.  Do not just say oh sorry and walk to the next table.  maybe offer to change it or somethng.  This would be antoher -1 star.

I guess its the thing with asian places, that they tend to focus more on the food than service.  So 3 star for the decent food I guess is fair."}
{"text":"It has been several years since we went here.  My wife wanted sushi so the entire family decided to head on over for dinner.  They have happy hour until 6pm so that was an added bonus.  My wife ordered several sushi rolls and loved them all.  My son and I each ordered a combo meal.  The food was delicious!  We all enjoyed our meals.  The service was great too.  The only negative was they do not have a children's menu."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious sushi. We are from out of town and gave this a try! Very impressive ... And If we can we would come back. Wish we had taken a picture of the sushi, but we didn't. Also the pot stickers were delicious too...."}
{"text":"Attempted to check this place out tonight because I heard it was good. I'm on travel for business and my company gave me an American Express card for all my expenses. Well after driving down here and just getting ready to order, I ask to make sure they accept Amex and sure enough they don't. Also they don't accept discover cards either so I left. They didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"We just moved up here from Tucson and we found our almost perfect replacement for a sushi place. We like these small family run Sushi places. This one is located in a small strip mall. We stay away from fancy places like Ra or Otaku. Mikados has generous portions and fairly priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the place is busy so you know the fish is new. The staff here are super friendly with great service.  The only thing we didn't like is that they do not give you is free edamame and miso soup like our place in Tucson. That is not a big deal though.  We are sushi snobs and this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Although the food was quite delicious. I ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, edamame and a spicy salmon roll. The total came to 18.00 even. I left 24 dollars on the table. When I left, as I approached my car, the waitress chased after me and stated \"WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SERIVCE?!\"
Puzzled, I politely responded \"no, why?\"
And this rude ass said \"Because I thought you would have tipped more\"

ARE YOU JOKING ME? That is so rude and I almost wanted to tell her to give me my 6 dollars tip back because shoot, I could put that in my gas tank lady. 

Good food but not good enough for me to come back. Sayonara."}
{"text":"Just went for the second time, and it was WAY better than the first.  The Spicy Tuna Poppers are so good you almost forget about the sushi you ordered.  If you think Sushi Deli in San Diego is 4-stars, Mikado is the place to go when you're in Phoenix.  The Boston roll was the best I've EVER had.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Close to my house.  Excellent service. This tone I ordered the spicy chicken.  Real goo.  They have three sushi chefs that know what they're doing"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and loved it. Quick, attentive service, and the food was excellent. I had the sushi lunch with a salad added. Simple salad and the dressing is sooo yummy - just perfect. Spicy Tuna Sushi was the best I ever had. Hubby chose the tempura and a salmon and avocado sashimi - he thought it was spectacular. I am sure we will be there again and again in the future - what a find!"}
{"text":"I'm in from LA on business. Stopped by as it was close to my hotel. Glad I did! Everything was awesome. I started out with miso and the shrimp tempura. Miso was super hot and shrimp was more fried than tempura; but oh so good. Had some tuna & salmon sushi and a shrimp tempura roll. All great,  but the tuna was a little dry. Service was awesome,  they're right on it. Would have given 5 but for the scalded tongue and tuna. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Thank you YELPER!!! Since moving here from California, we haven't found a spot for sushi that is ACTUALLY GOOD! And tonight, you nailed it with your post.  

Great food and service for our first and definitely not our last time here."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times since we moved here, and the best I can say is that it's inconsistent. Some times the food is really excellent and what you expect, and sometimes it's totally wrong and not good.

For example, I got a katsudon here twice. One time it was done correctly: nice tonkatsu sliced up with an egg on it, sauteed onions underneath, a bit of sauce and nice white rice. Second time no egg, tonkatsu was sparse, way too many onions, and the rice was just drowning in the sauce. The first time it was awesome, which is why I ordered it again. Second time, no thanks. Seems like everything has been like this, even the sushi.

Also, the service is really slow. I don't know if they've been understaffed or what but it took forever to order drinks, then order food, then get the food... last time I was starving and this pissed me off. 

Anyway this place is decent, but as far as sushi places we've tried out here it doesn't hold a candle to Shimogamo."}
{"text":"A consistently great place, and one of the few I've found that actually does the deep fried rolls correctly. The staff are excellent and give superb service, and the sushi chefs fun to be around and most skilled in their art. Just wish they stayed open later than 9pm on the weekend, but other than that small quibble I've always been pleased when I've been there."}
{"text":"Cute quaint place. About a dozen or so tables and booths. Also a small sushi bar for about a dozen or so people. We came for a late lunch. It wasn't busy at all! Was greeted promptly and seated in a nice booth. We ordered the lunch special. You can choose how much or little you want. Very appealing! The vegetable tempura was light and crisp, not greasy at all. All the sushi we ordered was fresh light and delicious! Our waiter was attentive and helpful. The chicken teriyaki was moist and tasty. Think we've found a new place for sushi!"}
{"text":"I am torn about giving this wonderful cozy restaurant my true rating. 5 stars. Its so good , so intimate, the staff is so nice and attentive. Its soooo close to home. I want this place to thrive.   But.  I just want this to be my sweet secret.  We now love this delicious place so much, we come every week."}
{"text":"Far and away South Chandler's best sushi and tempura, and their miso soup is wonderful too. The staff is very friendly and by your second or third visit, you'll feel like you were missed on the days you didn't come in for lunch. Speaking of which, the lunch special combinations (sushi and tempura, for instance) are not only a great value, but are amazingly fresh and tasty, with the sushi prepared while you wait (never in advance). They have an extensive menu for specialty rolls, too, and if there is a better sushi option in the east valley, we haven't found it. Can't recommend highly enough!"}
{"text":"Perfect every time. I no longer go anywhere else for sushi, as Mikado is among the best I've  ever tried. Great atmosphere, and have never had a problem with the service or time it takes to get food. The fish itself is among the highest quality that I've found since moving from NY. The prices are good as i have definitely spent more in places with an obnoxious atmosphere that blasts club music and serves creative, but small and of lesser quality dishes. Mikado is a must try if you enjoy sushi."}
{"text":"i'm so sad!  this used to be my favorite place in Chandler.  Like... visit once a week, tell all of my friends, dream about eating here favorite place.

I think success might have gotten to their head but they are no longer the sweet little hole in the wall secret sushi place i knew them once to be with the amazing customer service and great food.

i recently went for happy hour with my mom... let's be honest, their happy hour was never that amazing but it was decent.  enough to make the excuse to come in.

we order... which takes a while, despite there being only being three other tables.  we were ignored for a while.  not a deal breaker.  i get that you might be busy or new.  everyone seemed to be a new face so i let it slide.  

every visit, my mom orders the same thing... tuna tataki -- not super spicy. it's her favorite thing on the menu & we've been ordering it for at least two years that way. we were told by three different people that wasn't possible.  tuna tataki is naturally spicy so there isn't any way to make it not so spicy.  they finally cave & tell us they'll do it for us this time... when she gets it, it's still pretty spicy & she can't eat it.  

i ordered scallop nigiri.  the sushi chef asked if i wanted spicy scallop which should have been my first clue... nope.  just regular please.  the thing was drenched in lemon juice but that couldn't hide the intense fishy smell.  i know scallops are hit or miss in arizona but i could always look forward to coming to mikado & getting something fresh... i guess i just trusted them more not to serve that.  i was wrong.

i ordered the albacore onion sashimi also & was completely baffled by the texture of the fish.  it was mushy & fishy tasting... despite the ponzu & onion to cover up the taste.  i couldn't finish it.

we didn't receive our salads.  waters weren't refilled.  it was the worst experience i've had at mikado & after an intense decline in customer service and food quality, i've decided to retire it from my favorite places in phoenix.  :(  it's sad but i'd rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Mikado Sushi is my place to go when I'm craving some really good sushi that is very close to my neighborhood.  Whether it would be a simple roll, hand roll, or one of their specialty rolls, I always tend to leave very satisfied and my sushi-fix is in check.

Though it is not upscale than the more trendy, upbeat, and sophisticated sushi establishments with over-the-top exquisite menu items, Mikado Sushi has the decorative decor to keep true to Japanese ambiance along with your traditional hand made rolls and hand rolls, which I can never go wrong with.  Every once in a while, I'll have one of their specialty rolls, just to change things up.  The Dynamite Roll, with the baked scallops on a California Roll, are truly my favorite!

Owners San and Sue are just the nicest people you will ever meet.  Very friendly people and they are always accommodating, whether we are sitting in and dining or just coming in to pick up a take out order.  The food is very consistent, fresh and priced reasonably, unless you come to Happy Hour during the week.  Selected rolls get a price change and tends to help stretch out my buck sometimes.

Always love sitting up at the bar and watching the chefs create beautiful and delicious sushi with aesthetics and presentation.  Plus, I just love the smell of raw fish.  I don't know why... I just do. =)

Mikado Sushi is my special \"hole-in-the-wall\" gem and I hope it becomes yours too!"}
{"text":"Very good place.  It is cozy, not loud, and mellow.  The sashimi was very fresh.  For $20 we ordered a sashimi plate that had about 6 types of fish.  The miso soup and seaweed salad were well above average.  We tried a sake, which I never remember the names of.  It was also good.  Red wine I remember, sake always forget.  We also ordered an albacore roll with garlic and pickled onion.  Sounds a little different but so good.  The prices are  reasonable and the waitress was very attentive and sweet.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Mikado 10+ times. The food is excellent and consistent. The staff is friendly and very attentive. 

I get the 3 item lunch combo. Shrimp tempura roll and spicy California roll are both great. Chicken cutler and mixed tempura are also very solid options."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants that I like to go to occasionally. I've tried their tonkatsu ramen and sushi and I really love them! I think the service is actually really quick or at least try to be as well."}
{"text":"Good fresh Japanese fare with great mix and match choices of bento boxes. Get the Salmon Kama with another roll or fresh sashimi !"}
{"text":"Let's start off with; the service is mediocre but the food is worth it.  If you can get past the fact that once you are seated and have your sushi, any thought of a drink refill should be put right out of your mind.  But like I said, the food is better than RA and Kona so if food quality is on the top of your mind, you must try Mikado.  I lived close to Mikado for 8 years and my son and I went there often over that time.  Now that I don't live close to it, I still go out of my way to go.  It's a nice experience and is pretty low key.  The lightening is even pretty dim, which appeals to the sushi lover who isn't impressed by the bright flourescent lighting in typical resaurants.  It's a bonus that a Japanese couple actual own and operate it.  ;-)"}
{"text":"I was in search of a sushi spot in AZ because I was really craving sushi on my stay here and after going over yelp and calling a different place that did NOT want us to come because our party was too big (it was only 6 of us) we decided to give this place a shot. Im glad we did. When we got here there was only 1 party before us and it kind of made me think eekkk maybe there not that good but as soon as we sat I kid you not the place got packed! Weirddd...

I ordered an appetizer, Tuna Tataki, and O.M.G it was the best thing I have ever tried in my life. The sauce that it had was amazing, the tuna was fresh as can be and almost melted in your mouth. I wish I would've ordered about 3 of them cuz I would have ate em all. We also ordered the STST(not sure if im spelling that right, oh well), a salmon roll, and a crunchy tempura roll. They were all good! The STST roll was soo good. I loved the spicy tuna on top. I give this place a 5 stars because there is nothing that I did not like about this place. Service was great, food was excellent, restaurant was clean and spacious enough for us. Hope to be back next time I am in AZ!"}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for 17 years (my wife is Japanese), and we have been on the prowl for a good sushi restaurant in Chandler....not just a place that give you some specialty rolls (which are mostly unheard of in Japan). Mikado Sushi comes the closest we can find to \"authentic\" Japanese sushi, which is hard to find being that we are in the middle of a desert. 

The quality was very good. Service was excellent. Very reasonable prices. They even have a beer from Gunma prefecture which added to the experience. I would say you will never get close to the quality and taste of Japanese food in Arizona, but this venue will be as close as you can get.

It definitely gets crowded on a Friday night between 6 and 7. Avoid those times. But after 7, it thins out very quickly."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Sushi is very good and the happy hour is AMAZING. I'd recommend the STST."}
{"text":"Hubby and I just ate here during happy hour. The place itself is small and not stroller friendly at all but the food was fresh and delicious and the staff was very friendly. Happy hour prices are also pretty good"}
{"text":"4.5!
-.5 for the ambiance. Or maybe just cos it's my birthday. I was expecting it to be a little modern and bigger but when we went inside it was like 10 booths and a few tables plus the bar. It looks like a mom and pop restaurant, an aged mom and pop restaurant. Plus the plum wine that I ordered....meh.

Wanted to order Sushi Boat but the lady (probably owner) said they don't do that, but I was persistent. haha So she said if we ordered 6-8 sushi/rolls then they would do it for me. And a few moments later,  ta-da! Gigantic wooden boat bearing sushi goodness. A+ for the service! The server, girl who had thick bangs, was nice, a little too nice (rechecking us every 10 minutes), but I'd rather have that than a waitstaff that's totally ignoring me.

I forgot which exactly we had, but I'll try to recall...We had the Salmon Sashimi, Las Vegas Roll, Salmon Tempura Roll, Yellow Tuna and Salmon Sashimi Roll, and this kind of Veggie Roll I forgot the name of. Everything was outstanding! But my favorite was the Las Vegas Roll, the smokiness of it, ohhh I love it! 

Summary: Great for chill night with the homies, or with the fam. Wouldn't recommend it for birthday parties or birthday dinners - there's nothing special for you. If you just like to have a worthy Sushi night and have time to kick back and enjoy a Kirin then this is the place for you! :)"}
{"text":"Great sushi, reasonably priced. I've found the service to be acceptable, the waitresses are always very friendly and attentive - not sure why so many negative comments describing them otherwise? My husband likes their dinner menu (he doesn't eat sushi) and says he hasn't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi, but good for Chandler, AZ.  Came here during lunch and service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for my wife's Birthday dinner.  When we arrived they didn't have our table and said it was a 20 min wait.   We understand that mistakes happen but they didn't apologize nor didn't seem to care.  Because they were so rude we left and went to another sushi place down the street.  Glad we left."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, good prices. The inside is pretty small and gets fairly crowded during happy hour, but it remains pretty quiet."}
{"text":"Fresh great tasting sushi."}
{"text":"I've been here several times to sushi is always fresh and of high-quality. The rice was nice and moist and cooked very well. The service at our table was great both waitresses checked on us multiple times.  I showed up right before the dinner crowd when it was crowded both waitresses were working hard.  I like the atmosphere of the restaurant it is a small setting.  I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for over 4 years. Everyone knows my name (the Cheers theme song popped in my head after typing that). I eat here frequently by myself, with my spouse and with friends. When I have vendors at work take our team out to lunch I always bring them here. I also always choose Mikado to host my birthday dinner. Mikado's has lots of new regulars because of me! :)   The sushi is so fresh and I haven't found anywhere else in the valley that can beat their prices!"}
{"text":"Picked up some sushi & rolls today. Had the Shrimp Tempura Roll, Spider Roll, and Salmon Skin Roll. All of them were really tasty.

My wife had the Mackerel (Saba), Salmon, and Eel Nigiri. The Salmon was by far her favorite, nice big pieces that simply melted in her mouth she said. The Mackerel however was a bit on the small side, they tried to make up for it with some extra shreds of Mackerel on the side but they were like leftover cut pieces.

All that for $44 seemed a bit high in my opinion, however the taste was not bad on the pieces that were decent in size.

Will give this place another chance at some point but in my opinion there are better places in the area."}
{"text":"Always loved this place but then they got a new manager or owner -- the area around the sushi bar turns us off of eating now. Messy bussing stations on both sides, open trash bins, boxes, lots of containers. 

Sushi is ok but they no longer have new rolls on the board anymore so the menu has been the same for a long time.

Just not a positive expereince any more -- folks who work there are very friendly though.

Bummer..."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go back after trying their lunch menu. I went again for dinner and now I eat there once a week. . The fish always tastes fresh, the servers are very friendly and the Sushi Chefs were pleasant but not overbearing. 

Ohh and they have a good happy hour menu"}
{"text":"I will always remember this place as the sight of the worst meal I ever had. I tipped 25% just so I wouldn't feel bad as I'm writing this. 

Service was unsatisfactory. We were not offered a hello, a place to sit or even acknowledged for that matter.  When we finished our meal I was craving mochi but was instead brought the check by the other waitress. 

The meal was a shitty bowl of seafood udon with overlooked, sparse muscles and inedible mixes of shrimp and octopus (both were overcooked and rubbery as well). I also had the worst spider roll to date. 

Do not eat here if you are seeking good, fresh and clean eating environment. 

Eat here if you want to punish yourself."}
{"text":"I always order the same thing, spicy tuna or yellowtail roll. Wine isn't in the happy hour menu, bummer. All is good!"}
{"text":"We love Sushi, so we won't be back.  Let me start off by saying no one acknowledged us for 10 minutes.  Then it took forever to receive our food.  The sushi and sashimi wasn't good at all.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Disappointing atmosphere and disgusting food. Tried this place based on the good reviews. It was a waste of time and money.  The sushi was served almost warm, bordering on tepid, and the texture was very wrong, all chopped up and mushy, (in particular the salmon sushi).

Prices were not good, even taking into account the sub-standard atmosphere.  The food was horrible, worst sushi ever."}
{"text":"It's true, it's a little hard to find, but that usually means better, right?  In this case, yes.  

I love this place!  Fresh fish and friendly faces.  The chefs are fun and lighthearted and the owners are so sweet, you get a big warm welcome when you walk in the door. Totally a laid-back casual, friendly environment.  Easy to order with pictures and descriptions of all the sushi on the menu, complimentary green tea, oh and try the raspberry wine, soooo yummy.  

They have some dinner entrees and apps for those who dont do sushi, but I wouldn't go there for the dinners it's all about the sushi. 

Defiantly not a chain, it's where the locals around here go."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place!!! Love Angry Cucumber appetizer. We always order the Bluefin Tuna Sashimi. Yummmmm"}
{"text":"I only gave it 1 star because i did get my drink order right away.  They weren't super busy, but after my drink came and my menu, i never saw them again.   I got up and asked if i could order and they all nodded yes , but still nothing.  I walked out after waiting for service."}
{"text":"Sadly, it appears that Mikado Sushi has closed for good. :-( It's a shame, too, because I think their combination of fresh fish and reasonable prices was hard to beat."}
{"text":"My 7 year old (who is slowly becoming a sushi fanatic) and I dropped in here tonight after an early movie. I would agree with earlier reviews that there is little to no ambiance. However, the Sushi was excellent AND very affordable. Though the menu is fairly extensive, we stuck to the basics and had shrimp nigiri (no brainer), 2 lobster rolls (excellent), a Caterpillar roll (fighting over who got the last piece), edamme, 2 glasses of a decent Chardonnay (for me, not my daughter) and finished off with some white rice strawberry ice cream. . All of this was just $48 and tasted great!  I don't think it hurt that we sat at the sushi bar and watched the Dbacks win in extra innings. :) Me thinks this will become a regular sushi hang out for us. Good sushi, good service and good prices."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while. It's okay depending on whom serves you. If you get the waitress that served us forget about it. I am not one to give bad reviews but this was horrible. This waitress literally lied and avoided us because of her mistakes. Drives me crazy when people act like this in a service business. Anyway I would not recommend anyone here if you get this waitress. I'm not going back ever in the chance I end up with her."}
{"text":"We found this place after trying to go to a different sushi place in Chandler that had we found had closed.  It was a great find! We ordered a ton of food:  miso soup, beef teriyaki, tempura, several different rolls, every item was delicious! They have a large menu with a lot to choose from.  The service was very friendly and fast. The price was more than reasonable. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying this place for quite a while, figured I should finally review :)

This is not a trendy, upscale, over-the-top sushi place. You will not find the absolute best, most exotic items. But what you will find is reasonably priced Japanese fare that is fresh, tasty and consistent.

I've enjoyed their sashimi offerings - the tuna and the spicy salmon avocado. I've over-indulged on several of their delicious sushi rolls. And my wife is partial to their Tuna Tataki - great sauce! 

Has items for my picky, non-sushi eater (fried prawns or the pork tenderloin).

Their service is always friendly but they get distracted or confused or just lost (can't quite figure it out). And I've not seen any advantage to sitting at the bar as in any other sushi place. So some quirks but good food, good prices."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place. Hands down. They have the best salad dressing. The volcano roll is my favorite. It's topped with salmon tuna and scallops. They have really good dinner and lunch specials."}
{"text":"Great lunch time or dinner spot especially for the price. Their sushi is pretty good as well as any thing they coat with tempura. Their lunch time 2 item special which comes with soup or salad and rice will only set you back less then 8 bucks. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got sushi to go had never been here. Was very tasty and well portioned. Seemed fresh felt great after. Got crispy potstickers too and they were tasty like the dipping sauce. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"So happy to have accidentally found this place! Hamachi X Hamachi roll is so delicious, and I may actually punch a stranger for the Volcano roll... oh cherry blossom roll they are all amazing!! 
I get my food to go from here since I usually go on my lunch break from work. They are all SO friendly welcome me everytime I come in and say goodbye whole heartedly. The woman whom answers the phone knows my name now... obviously I have a sushi problem.. hey it could be worse

I highly advise you to go here"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a late lunch during happy hour a few weeks ago. We both got the avocado roll and the veggie tempura roll and they were both very tasty. Our only complaint about the whole place was that the tempura roll was way too big to eat in one bite - this seems to be a common theme in Arizona sushi. It just seems so wrong to eat a piece of sushi in more than one bite, but there was no way I'd be able to chew if I'd tried. But it was yummy and I was happy to see that there was more than just one vegetarian roll on the menu.

Happy hour prices (at least for the food, we didn't order drinks) are great. We got four rolls, two miso soups, and green tea and I think the total was under $20. The place wasn't very crowded so the service was fast and the people were friendly. And the decor was nice and simple, though I'm not a huge fan of TVs in restaurants.

I'll definitely be coming back here in the future!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best, freshest tasting sushi in the east valley! So much better than RA, Kona etc and definitely better priced!"}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour. Waitress was quick seating me and taking my drink order. Happy hour prices are very good. Sushi was good nothing spectacular though. Sat at the sushi bar and had to listen to the shushi chef talk politics the entire time"}
{"text":"Not sure if the negative reviewers just had a bad night.  Service was excellent.   Food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Mikado's by a good friend and we all went there one night and ordered about 10x what we ended up eating. Not only is the sushi good but the other things such as tempura are also amazing. But I did get a chance to try at least a little bit of each thing and it was great. The service is great they are great at taking care of you and helping you out.
The only thing I would say is that it is a bit pricey, it's not someplace that I would go on a regular basis, but every once in a while is nice."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Lunch specials are great. Ordered the $9 lunch with salmon roll and 5pc chef's choice nigiri. Also got 4pc shrimp nigiri and 2pc salmon roe nigiri. Loved it! Service is very friendly' prices are reasonable and they gave us samples of fried rice and noodles."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice now. Both occasion were great. Seated immediately, great fast serve and fresh delicious food. will return!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service except for the sumo sized waitress with a mouth and without a smile. Awesome place for lunch and dinner. Eat here often and will continue as long as she is not my server."}
{"text":"Visiting my mom in Chandler, I had a hankering for teriyaki. My mom said Mikado had a great lunch special, so we went.

If your idea of \"special\" is warm spicy tuna rolls and chicken that tastes like someone made it in a toaster oven, then Mikado is pretty damn special.

I like my teriyaki very saucy, very sweet and a bit charred. No such luck.

I can't think of a single thing they did right.

I suppose the price was OK: $7.95 for teriyaki, white rice, miso soup, a small salad and a four-piece spicy tuna."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. The miso soup and salad dressing were too salty, tempura flavor was a little muted, and the chicken katsu (cutlet) was a bit dry and chewy.  Specialty rolls that we had included the Dynamite Roll and Scorpion Roll, and they were both solid. Our server was really friendly and accommodating, and she even provided us with chopstick \"helpers\" for the less experienced chopstick users in the party -- then she disappeared after the food arrived, and drink refills became scarce. 7/10 on the food, some small tweaks and it could be great. But hey, they have Asahi Super Dry by the bottle, and that goes a long way."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite sushi spot.  This is the best sushi I have had in Arizona.  

I went in around 1:30 on a Saturday and sat down at the sushi bar.  The place is very cozy.  Would be a good place to go with friends and relax.  Very laid back.

Instead of ordering off the menu, I asked the chef to make whatever was good today.  He started me with the blue fin sashimi.  The fish was very fresh.  The tuna melted in my mouth.  

I told the chef I was still hungry and asked him to make something else for me.  He made a delicious uramaki (rice on the outside) roll with salmon (I think), wasabe (the real stuff), and mayonnaise.  This was REALLY GOOD.  

Like the Hungry Caterpillar, though, I was still hungry.  The chef then presented me with an interesting dish that was avocado and fish sitting on thin slices of lemon.  Not sure what the fish was, but the blend of lemon, soy sauce, and avocado was the perfect finish to this grand lunch.

While I ate and watched the chef, I chatted with the staff.  Everyone was very friendly.  Mikado Sushi is what going out for sushi should be: great food in a casual, friendly atmosphere.

If you like sushi and are adventurous, don't order, just let the chef decide what to make you.  It is extremely flattering to the chef, and he will go out of his way to impress you."}
{"text":"I used to crave this place when I lived in Chandler a few years ago.  When I come back to visit, I usually try to eat there for lunch.  They do have a great lunch special where you can choose 2, 3, or 4 entree items, I believe it goes from $8.95, $10.95, & $12.95.  Items include everything from chicken Teriyaki, shrimp tempura, gyoza, spicy tuna roll, egg roll, edamame, etc.  They have an A, B, C, & D categories, but you can only choose 1 from each category.  There are probably 30 different things to choose from.  The service is usually pretty solid too.  This last visit though, the kitchen was incredibly slow, it took about 30 minutes to get our food, we got there after the lunch surge.  The food normally a 4-1/2 stars was a 2-1/2.  The chicken had a rubbery texture & the tempura tasted like fry oil had been used too much and the items kept too long in the fryer.  

I will give them another shot when I come back in town in a few months, maybe I got them on a bad day because they used to be a 4-1/2 star place.   Right now they are a 2/2-1/2 star place, but rounded up based off of the past.  Will update after I return."}
{"text":"Hey there.  I have been eating sushi for almost 15 years.  I have been to 100s (approaching 1000) of places in about a dozen states and 3 countries.  Mikado has some of the best fish I have ever had.  The tuna, salmon, white fish and yellow tail are among the freshed and blows away every California place I have been.  It is flow in fresh 2 to 3 times per week.  I have seen the packaging.  It is literally dated the day before on the boat in the pacific.  Thats crazy to me.  Anyway the sushi is amazing.  As a sushi place you expect the service to suck, but they try hard and I give them a solid B for service.  The beer is cold, the sake hot (although they have great cold stuff too) and the prices are very reasonable.  In summary

sushi - 9.8
booze - 8
service - 6
prices - 9
other food - who cares

As to the little whiner visiting mommy, well I don't go to a sushi bar and order grilled chicken, I am betting a retard like that goes to a steak joint and orders a shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Not bad at all!!  

I have only been here once so far, but based on my first time I won't have any problem going back.  Everything was above average.  

I went in during my lunch break and in reality you can't beat their lunch specials.  I had a Spicy Salmon Roll and an Avocado Roll- this came with a bowl of rice and a small Miso soup.  Grand total = $11.00.  Both were simple yet tasty.  Service was good and no complaints from me there.  

I've had sushi at a few other places in the area and so far this was the best.  I wouldn't call it amazing sushi, but for the price and location it can't be beat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi joint in the Valley! It would be a five star place but there have been several times when the service was super sloooooow. The service is always friendly and helpful though, which matters more to me. 

My whole family goes to this spot and it was actually my grandpa who found the place. The food is awesome, the prices are a little below average, and it's not so swanky you can't take kids. Love love love Mikado! Headed there tonight with my son, parents, and grandparents. Four generations of raw fishy joy!"}
{"text":"Nice variety of sushi from an establishment that has been here for years.   They have great lunch specials no matter what you tolerance for actual sushi or sashimi is.   The bento boxes are a mix and match choose your own adventure, so you can always get exactly what you are looking for."}
{"text":"I work in the complex and I often get sushi to go for lunch. I love spicy tuna and they have a really good California crunch roll with cream cheese in it! Yum! It's got a cute sushi bar and Cozy lighting."}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite place in the east valley and Chandler in particular. Not only is the food amazing but the staff are as friendly as they come. Do yourself a favor and stop by here!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and this is still one of my favorite sushi restaurants. It's not fancy but always clean and the staff is friendly. The sushi is some of the best and most authentic I've come across. If you're in the east valley and you aren't looking for neon lighting and oversized decorative fish aquariums come check out mikados. Best sushi in Chandler!"}
{"text":"I ate here today around 5pm and was fully satisfied with the experience. Their portions much larger than I expected. Hands down the largest nigiri I've ever had. The food was extremely fresh and the sushi chef was great. Solid experience."}
{"text":"I've been living in Chandler for 7 years now. I go every chance I have the chance to. I am a sushi LOVER!!! I've eaten at every sushi place possible in AZ. No sushi place beats Mikado, hands down!! The service is always great! It always has a great atmosphere, they're very welcoming, and the food is great! I STRONGLY suggest anyone go here and try it! 

I always get the \"STST\" (shrimp tempura & crushed spicy tuna) & the \"volcano\" (California tempura roll & a diced mixture of sashimi) & the \"salmon poppers\" (jalapenos stuffed with salmon and deep fried & cut in half). I would really recommend this place! 

It will be worth it!!! (:"}
{"text":"Great Sushi. Have been going there quite a bit. The last three times however the service has dropped considerably and we are going to try and find another sushi joint. Hope to be back soon as the food is excellent. Service was...not anymore."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area! Service and atmosphere are traditional Asian hospitality. Prices are fair, too."}
{"text":"Thee fish is always fresh, the rolls never fall apart, and the service is great. Hands down the best sushi restaurant in Chandler. So good that this is my family's second time eating here this week. Try the quail egg shooter!"}
{"text":"I am always in search of a new sushi spot and fellow yelpers supply me with plenty of options. After reading the reviews on this place I decided to drop in.

I arrived around 6pm and the place was empty with the exception of one other party. We were immediately sat and drink orders taken.  We then placed our food orders. The food was good. The sashimi was fresh, delicious and cut into bite sized pieces.  The price was excellent. The servers were attentive but not intrusive. A wonderful experience and I shall return.

Diners beware this is a small place and by 6:30pm the place was packed and customers either waited or were turned away."}
{"text":"Can't understand why this place would ever get over 2 stars at best.  Food was meh at best, you could get better shrimp tempura from your local grocery frozen section - which I'm almost sure is what they use.  My bill was close to $30 for a shrimp tempura appetizer, miso soup, a cup of green tea and Hamachi kama, not a good deal at all."}
{"text":"Mikado really surprised me.  I didn't expect to find a Japanese restaurant so close to home with a nice atmosphere and pretty good food...but here it is! 

Sushi is really the thing here.  The tempura is good although the shrimp tempura had an odd coating that didn't match the veggies and it didn't seem like authentic tempura.  Miso soup is pretty good too.

But go for the sushi.  They're all about the sushi here."}
{"text":"My kids and I love this place!  Service....excellent!  Sushi.....flavorful and fresh!  Great prices on meals and sushi! Spicy tuna is our favorite menu item!"}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has reviewed Mikado!  Probably because no one can find Mikado....hmmm...

I tried this place one night for dinner just after my husband and I moved to Chandler.  We were sick of the chain restaurant hell that is Chandler and decided Mikado looked good.  It's hard to find though if you don't know it's there.  It's in a shopping center at Alma School and Queen Creek (southeast corner of the intersection).  I used to get my nails done at a place in the same center so I'd seen it and I love sushi so, why not?

It definitely seemed to be a locals place and seemed pretty authentic (not Ra trendy).  My favorite that night was the Caterpillar Roll.  It was so cute and the chef had actually arranged it on a plate to look like a caterpillar, complete with sprouts for antennae.

Mikado is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"As a fan of MythBusters I am delighted to say I have officially busted a myth....there's no good sushi in Phoenix.  Not true--You can indeed find great sushi in Phoenix, Arizona (Chandler, to be more specific).  Stopped by Mikado for lunch today.  My very favorite way to take in a sushi date is by sitting at the counter and asking the artist behind the bar to send out suggestions.  It was recommended we start with some great blue fin tuna (hooray for October, as it is the beginning of the season).  Next up, a house specialty...Salmon Avocado Sashimi.  What makes it particularly great is the homemade Eel Sauce made in-house.  Delicately sweet and still lets the fish flavors come through.  We just had to finish up with the Dragon Roll to get our Unagi fix.  So glad we did.  We will definitely be back to Mikado (and by \"we\" I mean my hard to please 15 year old son and me.)"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for 8 years. The last time the service was horribly slow. It took over 20 minutes to get our check. Last night, we decided to give it another shot. Our family of three stood waiting for over 5 minutes. There was no line. No one greeted us, no one made eye contact, although four employees working in the dining area were within plain sight and clearly walked in front of our family. There were 5 open tables and we were completely ignored. We left, discouraged and choose an alternating dining experience. There are too many good dining establishment to choose from to tolerate this treatment. Mikado needs to work on service!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and I must add a very generous portion of Hamachi!! I will return!!

I normally have a mid day snack and this spot is perfect for that. Great service and great fish!!"}
{"text":"When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries. Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out. Luckily for us Mikado is literally a 2 minute drive from our house. :)

The restaurant is low-key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience. The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable. 

So anyway, on to the sushi! I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura. The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it's so ginormous. They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce. LOVE! And while I'm on the subject, Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura. Their tempura shrimp is super crispy, isn't greasy and always fresh out of the fryer. The Crunch Roll is superb, the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious. Their prices are great and you still get so much food. How can you go wrong? If you're within a 20 mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by.

Also, I can't say this enough: Please support your local businesses! They depend on your patronage!"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot. We always order the bento boxes, either the 3 option for me or the 4 option for my guy.

Our fave picks are the quid salad, tempura, white fish sashimi, tuna rolls and the chicken terriyaki. Good prices as it comes with soup as well."}
{"text":"I am always happy with the service and food here.  I usually get one of the spicy rolls, and or some tempura.  I came with my mom, and she really liked the chicken teriyaki,  They were also giving out samples of some new chicken they were trying.  It was very good as well.  It's a solid place to come for sushi.  Casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Well I like thier lunch deal. 4 items for $11.95. Chicken teriyaki was good... a lil dry but still good. The tempura was different than i'm used to but still decent. miso soup yum and the spicy yellowtail roll was pretty great. The white tuna sashimi was simply amazingness!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good lunch combos. Nice sushi rolls and I love the vegetable tempura and gyoza."}
{"text":"I write this review with the caveat that Arizona has to fly or truck in any seafood so it's obvious the quality of seafood is going to be somewhat lower in comparison to where I come from, Seattle, or any other coastal city. 

I've been searching for a good sushi since my girlfriend and I moved here from Seattle -- one would say we've been spoiled with Sushi. We tried Teharu upon our roommate's/several coworkers' suggestions when we first got here and liked it, but craved something better than the standard belt-centric kind of place... we needed more than that. 

I found Mikado via Google maps search for \"sushi restaurants near Chandler\" and was attracted to the vast menu options and decently laid out website. I showed my girlfriend and she also agreed it was worth a try so we went out there.

We ordered the Boston (Philly) Roll, Salmon Roll, Salmon Teriyaki and Chicken Teriyaki (Teriyaki is always a good baseline indicator for restaurants, especially in Arizona). 

The rolls were well constructed by a Sushiman behind the bar where they serve all kinds of beer, sake, homemade Green Tea, etc. The Green Tea was refreshingly light. The sushi didn't fall apart and tasted great. We preferred the Boston Roll over the Salmon Roll, and the Salmon Teriyaki over the Chicken version. Nothing we ordered was bad which is always a plus. The restaurant offered extra rice if necessary and Miso Soup. The server was also very polite. Yes, the food came out in reasonable time. 

The atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming, nothing too elegant or intimidating. It reminded me a lot of those teriyaki joints up in Seattle that had been around forever but have been recently renovated. 

It is a little deep location-wise (buried in Ocotillo off Alma School/Queen Creek) but I think that keeps the restaurant from getting super busy and crowded. 

Overall, the place isn't 100% perfect but I would highly recommend it to anyone new to the area or anyone simply looking for a better sushi spot around town."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for happy hour which was around 3pm. The prices on sushi for happy hour is reasonable. Not pricey or anything. Sushi is okay. Its not great but not bad either. It could be better though. Some of the rolls we ordered were bland. I also ordered their miso soup. The miso soup is a little salty. I would recommend not to put too much next time. Otherwise it would have been perfect. Service was good. The server checked on us often. I might be back to give this place another chance. Hopefully, sushi and miso will be better next time I visit."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time Friday night. Horrible service. We were not greeted or acknowledged for what seemed almost 5 minutes. Finally after being seated we were given menus. Prices are pretty reasonable didn't see much of a happy hour menu so not sure if it's offered. After ordering an appetizer and sushi... We received our appetizer (edamame) very long after ordering... Strange as there is not much preparation that goes with it. Our sushi took triple the time to come out. Sushi was good so that is why I gave it 2 stars. Never once did our server apologize or come back to refill our water. Not a place I would visit again. Overall hated the service, the atmosphere and the overall experience."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. It's decent Sushi in AZ and it even appears to be owned and staffed by... wait for it... ACTUAL JAPANESE people. As opposed to 95% of sushi places owned/run by Koreans who memorized \"Hello', \"Thanks\", and \"Cheers' in Japanese and attempt to trick their customers by pretending to be Japanese.

Too bad this place is so far south it's practically Casa Grande adjacent."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant that I believe may be run by Korean folks who bring their own flavors to the meals.  The seaweed is a little tastier, the tempura batter and sauce are sweeter, they may put sesame oil in food, etc.  I am Japanese and insisted on staying with a more traditional Japanese cuisine but after trying Mikado's food, i'm hooked!  If you can handle a little spice, I recommend the STST roll (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna).  Their sushi is creative, fresh and tasty.  The prices are excellent and the service is prompt and friendly.  Go check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular foodie of Japanese food.  Definitely have had my experience with a wide variety of Japanese cuisine from Fast food to fine dining.  This restaurant has mediocre food and service.  Small variety of fish selections and skimped on fish quality  (low grade and ultra thin slices ) and service.  The service is not friendly enough nor thoughtful or helpful enough to feel like a neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Mikado is a cute little sushi place located on Queen Creek and Alma School. I pass it every day on the way to and from work and always wanted to check it out. On Monday I stopped in for lunch and they have some good lunch specials, they have your typical sushi/sashimi specials as well as teriyaki specials, katsu, and tempura specials but I went for the bento box. You can choose from two, three, or four choices and it comes with miso soup, steamed rice, and a drink. I ordered chicken teriyaki, gyoza, and a spicy salmon roll. The cuts of chicken were a little off (long, narrow strips) and overcooked but not to the point where I couldn't eat my food, the chicken just could have been better. Everything else was delicious though, the spicy salmon roll was one of the better rolls I've had in Arizona. The service was quick and attentive and it was pretty busy for 1 o'clock on a Monday. I'd definitely come back again for lunch or for dinner."}
{"text":"So incredibly bad.This is not a 4 star restaurant.

The service - The guy wanted to give us a 2 top for 4 of us (2 adults & 2 toddlers). I asked him for a 4 top because you can't keep toddlers from grabbing things off the table if they can reach across the whole thing. He REALLY did not want to give us a bigger table, although the restaurant only had 4 tables of people.

The food - The Dynamite Roll was awful. It was watery and fell apart and the scallops were disgusting. The chicken was cooked well, so that was really the only part we enjoyed. The rolls are tiny compared to other places I've been around here. The sushi was awful.

The atmosphere - There was a drunk doctor in a booth, screaming about how he hates this woman and that woman that he works with. They never asked him to quiet down or stopped serving him beer.

I would stop eating sushi if this was the last sushi place on earth."}
{"text":"Lunchtime during the week can be really slow. Almost two hours for four people ordering lunch combos. This is because they are severely understaffed. Only two servers for the whole restaurant? Other than that the lunch combos are a decent value and the chicken cutlet is good."}
{"text":"This is an awesome sushi spot. Prices are fair and the food was good. The cheif was nice and accommodating. Although, most of the servers spoke broken English."}
{"text":"This is a great little lunch place and the service is fantastic! There is a nice lunch menu, good prices, TVs, lots of seating and the staff is always energetic and friendly. I am not a sushi person but my friend loved what he ordered off the sushi menu. The menu is HUGE and there are so many different and unique plates. I like getting the mixed tempura or a teriyaki dish. It's also pretty quiet and laid back. We always get in and out quickly too."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in Arizona and it's for a great price.  The white tuna is the special key here at this sushi place.  I don't know any other place that has such delicious white tuna or even have white tuna.  The sushi is also very fresh and the pieces are thick.  I really enjoy getting their sashimi combo dish.  

Unfortunately, they do not give any complimentary desserts for birthdays.  They did, however, make my mom a bear with an orange (quite cute!)"}
{"text":"We are regulars here whether it be to sit down or take out. They let us sit wherever we want and are always so nice. I never feel rushed eating here. Great, calm environment. Sushi is always fresh and comes out quick. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing. I love their cucumber salad, their tempura is delicious without being soggy, the bento combos are adorable and overflowing with food.. and oh yeah, the sushi is AMAZING."}
{"text":"Service when it came was good.  But folks got lost for a while so it took a bit for someone to actually show up to take our order, which was odd since the place was near empty.

As for the food, I had relatively low expectations for sushi in Arizona so I was willing to be generous.  Having said that, the food was merely adequate...neither bad, nor good.  But what was really weird was that everything (keep in mind we're talking sushi here) came out warm.  I gotta admit that was a first for sushi I've had anywhere...and that covers a lot of territory around the world."}
{"text":"This small Japanese restaurant serves freshly made sushi, sashimi, and a wide variety of other traditional dishes that are well prepared.  The staff is very helpful. Their happy hour is great and their prices are inexpensive for what you get..
