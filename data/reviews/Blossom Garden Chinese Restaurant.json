{"text":"I went here to pickup takeout because of yelp great review, despite the not so nice environment.. i ordered pepper beef n chili chicken.. approx $10 per dish, very upset with the food quality.
Pepper beef is 30% meat, the rest is veggie n onions, Chili chicken is a bit bitter.

This is by far the worst chinese food i had in durham region. Spicy Dragon and Tangerine offers much better food"}
{"text":"I don't know how food can be so bland yet so salty at the same time. Chicken balls should be renamed to dough balls, sweet and sour sauce had no flavour. The egg roll had so much oil I had to wrap it in paper towel to soak it up, and even then it was totally inedible. Would much rather eat at the mandarin."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service, good food. 

Don't confuse their abruptness with rudeness, they're just good at quick good Chinese. 

House fried rice is delicious - a bit dry, but no egg smell like most places have. Chili chicken is just right. The hot and sour soup can be made spicy without losing the sour half. And the crab rangoons
 are a must."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, we had the Cantonese chow mien, sweet and sour chicken balls, the happy family, chicken fried rice and received the crab Rangoon free. The crab Rangoon was incredible, the rest of the order was bland and all tasted the same. Despite good reviews I was hoping for much better than what we got."}
{"text":"New to durham and this is by far the best chinese food we have found. Will continue to order from here for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered take out on a Friday night and we were extremely disappointed with the quality of food. The wonton soup broth was basically Soy sauce with frozen wontons and a couple veggies. The general tsao chicken was also dark and salty and the fried rice was drenched in Soy sauce - all in all I would say the theme is A TON OF SOY SAUCE IN EVERYTHING! Never again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since it opened. They are very quick on their feet in terms of serving customers and their service has greatly improved since they started. As for the food it is excellent. It replaced my love for jumbo combo with their seafood Cantonese chow mien and hot and sour soup. I would definitely recommend checking this place out. Prices are also very reasonable with big portions (especially the lunch combos)."}
{"text":"In my opinion one of the overall best 'Americanized' Chinese food places in Durham that's clean and fresh. No issues with hair, plastic or anything else in my food. 

Been ordering for the last 1.5- 2 years, food is still consistent. I'm originally from the states, and there's certain Americanized Chinese food staples there - crab Rangoon is one of them and served at every Thai and Chinese restaurant. Thai crab Rangoon tastes much different than the Chinese version but they still have it

I found this restaurant originally due to them serving crab Rangoon's - essentially cream cheese, very small portion of imitation crab, green onions deep fried in wonton. Not many Chinese places have it here, except Panda Express and 2-3 random locations all over GTA. This is one of the better crab Rangoon's served in GTA. I still find several of their dishes are delicious, besides the Rangoon's. Not sure why the reviews are off, but if you're craving Chinese that's fried and a bit greasy,  without going downtown, this is it. And the staff is very receptive to changing and asking for certain things - I.e, less sauce, more sauce, etc.

I'd recommend - 
wonton soup - it's fresh, has the proper amount of veggies, generous dumplings and if you try the 'house wonton' it comes with actual shrimp and chicken with the veggies and wontons. It is salty, but that's standard Americanized wonton soup!

Crab Rangoon's - one of the few places around that has. These are absolutely great. They're a little of the sweet side of a typical crab Rangoon, Try them! 

Dumpling - they do them right here. They're large and filled with meat/veggie filling. I prefer mine steamed but I've had the pan fried. Both are delicious and the homemade sauce they give is so tasty. 

Sweet and sour chicken - deep fried chicken fingers that you can dip in the standard sweet and sour sauce or with plum sauce. I find most of the time they get these moist. I've had a few one offs from them where they're dry/overcooked, but 95% they deliver moist.

General tsos/sesame chicken/orange chicken/orange beef- I think all of these are great, however these are drowned in sauce - I've asked for less sauce in past or sauce on the side and they've done this to a 'T'. 

Boneless sparerib - good, but a bit saucy. Again they're willing to do what you want so you can ask for less sauce."}
{"text":"Great people, fast service, food made fresh.  Recommend the free Crab Rangoon if you order enough to qualify for the freebie.  We also like the Pepper Beef, Boneless Spareribs, Sesame Chicken, Happy Family, and the House Special Wonton Soup.

We don't usually eat here.  It's a bit stark, so better for takeout or delivery.  Agree that sometimes they sound abrupt on the phone, but they are really pleasant in person and efficient (orders are correct, have all the condiments and fortune cookies, too)."}
{"text":"If you like normal Canadian style Chinese food, this place is not likely to let you down.  Extensive menu that's tasty, freshly made, and reasonably priced.  Now the speed...phone in your order and it's ready when they say it is.   Never seen a place so efficient that way.  They have your number on call display to confirm customer accuracy.  Disregard the rather cold sounding first impression of the person answering the phone though.  Never disappointed here. (Takeout only)"}
{"text":"Blossom Garden is only decent to anyone who is eating \"Chinese food\" for the first time here. The food is below substandard - everything is drenched with soy sauce, the fried rice is made up of old, stale rice, and the meat dishes use the cheapest, darkest cuts. If you order a dish mixed with vegetables, you bet you get 10% meat, 90% giant chunks of onion and green pepper. Do yourself a favor, don't eat here."}
