{"text":"Not so great. My wife had the special (roast beef)  and I had the veal.  Both sauces were packages, the meat was flavorless and the veggies were barely warm. Maybe their pizza and pasta are better?  Atmosphere is better upstairs versus the cafeteria feel down stairs. Looked like they had a nice patio.   Wait staff were friendly (our server), however the one serving drinks didn't know anything regarding the food specials. Not great team work."}
{"text":"Drove by, turned around, and came back for lunch on the deck patio. So glad we did! The outdoor area is huge compared to most and the warm and inviting  inside ambience beckons for a return visit soon.   Lunch was wonderful. This is a gourmet pizza lovers oasis with toppings such as feta, artichoke, smoked salmon and capers, and red, white or BBQ sauce.   We started with salads - one Caesar and one Insalata Mista (amazing presentation!) that were served with warm sourdough rolls. That was followed by a whole wheat, thin crust, Quattro pizza (artichokes, black olives, portobello and capers in lieu of the prosciutto). By the end the two of us were stuffed but very happy.   Only negatives were a bit slow on the service and the washrooms, while very large and modern were missing a regular clean up check.   We will definitely be back - it's nice to have a good option when coming through Brooklin at dinner time."}
{"text":"I was so happy with the service and the food. The Lasagna is so phenomenal. We ordered appetizers that were decent, and all the portions are really generous. My boyfriend was happy with the pizza as well.  Overall, I'll definitely be returning and have told several people to check it out. Really delicious."}
{"text":"I've only had the pizza here, but it's reasonably authentic and definitely worth a stop if you're in Brooklin.  Pizza in the GTA is typically disappointing, and I'm always happy to find a decent spot.  Add in a nice patio overlooking the village green, and this is a great find."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and reasonable prices. We will definitely go back.  We all tried different dishes. My wife like the pizza. My daughter really enjoyed her lasagna. My gnocchi was very good as well. I added sausage which was well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been Corrado's twice in the last year and I have really enjoyed it both times. The parking is fine, there is a small lot outside and a larger paid lot in the back - if you're going on the weekend or after 6pm then it's free.  Both times I've been it's been quite bustling and I've been seated in the upstairs loft which is great but a little loud if there is a full house.  The food is always amazing and the staff is always fantastic.   Love it here! A staple of Brooklin/Whitby town."}
{"text":"I have to say this is probably considered our \"go to\" local restaurant. We generally have a good experience and good value for your money. Keith (the manager) is friendly, remembers a face and often shakes my hand and thanks us for returning. I think that goes a long way in our local small market.   They could probably mix the menu up a little more. Otherwise, its worth visiting."}
{"text":"Corrado's is my go-to restaurant in the Durham Region. Any time my friends and I are looking for somewhere to eat, one of us inevitably pipes up with, \"Corrado's?\" The service here is always welcome and friendly, and I love the atmosphere; it always feels comfortable and homey. The pizza here is to die for good! My favourites are the Don Corrado and the Genovese! Highly recommend both."}
{"text":"Corrado is an Italian family oriented restaurant. The restaurant is nice Iside, with a nice patio. The service is inconsistent. You might be ignored when you get in and you standing with the waitress crossing you in front with plates, but having great service at the table. The food is good but not spectacular. Pizza maybe not the best choice, but decent. Good enough for a family dinner or lunch with the kids."}
{"text":"I love this place! Always friendly service and the food is great! Vodka penne is my fav. We love going on birthdays and just for a night out."}
{"text":"Returned to Corrado's for Patio beverages and a pizza!   I always do my best to return to a place for a follow up especially after a not so great experience.  This visit was an evening drop in for a \"quick\" pint and a pizza.   It was a not so busy Sunday evening and decided to give the Pesto Chicken Pizza a try and a cold beverage.  Drinks came quickly and pizza arrived 30 mins later!?!?  Sadly.. the pizza was not worth wait! The pizza had zero flavor... the chicken that was sparingly sprinkled over the pizza was almost like chicken jerky (so dry) it was chewy and bland and literally sucked the moisture out of your mouth.  I wanted so badly for this visit to be fantastic as it a great location and the patio is over looking a nice park.  Asked to speak with a manager.... we waited 10 mins, no show.  Paid and left.. not sure if we'll go back."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for a family dinner. I understand that a restaurant in a smaller town has to offer a lot of different options for different clientele, but I was confused. Is this a fine dining establishment (dark wood floors, leather chairs, high ceiling) or a sports bar (SIX televisions in the dining area)? Given the height of the ceilings and the fact that the TVs were placed close to the top, they weren't even convenient to watch (if you are trying to attract the sports crowd). The high ceilings also equals lots of noise.  The food was fine -- the salads looked amazing, and the pastas were tasty but nothing adventurous. I wouldn't drive all the way out here again for Italian, but a fine stop for a casual dinner if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Me and my parents go there every Wednesday for their pizza and pasta special. We've tried almost all of the pastas on the menu. We also always get one of our 2 favourite waitresses. Pictures are of some pastas that I got over the past visits."}
{"text":"Housed in a historical building located in the heart of downtown Brooklin, it is a family friendly, but if you're looking for a more 'adult dining experience, the second floor of this establishment might be what you're looking for....or you can just relax on the patio.    The menu made me very frustrated. This is one of those places that you can't decide because everything looked SO good. I was torn, so I asked our gracious server what she thought. The Apollo was the final decision, rose sauce, chicken, roasted red peppers...what more could you want?! My group, who had been there many times before, had no problems with their selections, Primavera and Pescatora. I was in complete shock at how fast our food arrived. Less than 15 minutes! We had barely finished our warm, crusty rolls when our food came.   My dad is Mr. Personality and seeing how staff handle his shenanigans is always good entertainment. All of the staff, from the host to our server to the bartender, were very friendly and knowledgeable. I was happy to see they would joke around with us, while remaining professional. I liked that the server didn't abandon us, but didn't bug us every 5 minutes either.   I can't pass up dessert, no matter how grateful I am that I wore stretchy pants. When I saw crème brulee, I was sold. Everyone else had a soft spot for cheesecake. I'm rather particular about my crème brulee, as you've seen in previous reviews. I was not disappointed. The cheesecake was also excellent. It wasn't heavy. It was light and didn't make you FEEL like you overate(Even though you probably did. Heehee!)."}
{"text":"This was the worst food I've ever had! Definitely not worth the cost. The sauce on the gnocchi tasted like Campbell's tomato soup :("}
{"text":"Read great reviews and came for dinner with my wife last week. Really nice place interior is well done and thought out well. Menu looked great I wanted to try a pizza and a pasta so I got the pizza with white sauce, prosciutto, and arugula the name escapes me at the moment but it was DELICIOUS. My wife ordered the tortellini, she's a tortellini buff and said it was the best she's ever had I thought it was very good too and the portion size was great value in my opinion.  Overall we had a great experience we recently moved out to Oshawa and this is now the only restaurant nearby my wife wants to go to, well be back and I look forward to trying other pastas and the patio once weather allows.  Well done, great food, great service, great value A+"}
{"text":"The food was good but very hot temperature. I had to wait for my dish too cool before I could truly enjoy it. The portion size is about average for the price. The dish was very saucy just like I enjoy them. The service was great. Cleared the table, dirty dishes and brought bill very promptly. Nice local place to try."}
{"text":"My wife & I were trying to organize a night out with some friends, & we ended up at Corrado's.  None of us had ever eaten there before, & I was excited to try them out.  Our party arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday (although my wife & I were late), & we were lucky enough to find a parking spot in the small private lot behind the restaurant, although many people have to park on the street.  We walked into the restaurant, & the place was packed, which reassures you that the food is good, & that they have no trouble getting people to come back.  Since they don't take reservations, we waited just over an hour for our table, because we requested to sit upstairs in the \"adults only\" dining room.  So we grabbed a couple of tables in the bar area & got some drinks & appetizers while we waited.  We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip & an antipasto platter to share, & both items were beautifully plated & very good.  Once our table upstairs was ready, we settled up our tab at the bar & adjourned upstairs to a very quaint, tastefully decorated, small dining area.  Our server, Diana, was very friendly & helpful with menu selections for some people who asked for recommendations.  I opted for the Fettucine Alfredo, which is my favourite pasta dish, with sausage added as an extra.  My wife selected the Penne Piemontese, which has prosciutto, portobello mushrooms, asparagus & sun-dried tomatoes in a gorgonzola cream sauce.  The wait time was standard, & we all had another drink while we waited.  When the food arrived, every dish looked exquisite, & we all dug in heartily.  Usually when I order pasta at other restaurants, it's very warm, but not quite hot.  Not so at Corrado's - every pasta dish was piping hot.  My fettucine was cooked perfectly, & their cream sauce was excellent.  The sausage I added was spiced just right, adding a nice compliment to the smooth creaminess of the Alfredo.  My wife's pasta was cooked perfectly as well, & while it was satisfyingly rich, it wasn't overly heavy, which is a fine line when you're dealing with cream sauces.  I was very full after the appetizers & pasta, & I'm not normally a dessert person, but I just couldn't leave without trying their \"Dream Bomba\", which was peanut butter gelato, covered with a chocolate shell, then drizzled with chocolate sauce & caramel.  Despite the fact that I was absolutely stuffed, I ate every morsel of the Bomba & would do it again in a heartbeat.  It was absolutely delicious, & something different that you don't see on a standard dessert menu.  The bill came, & I was pleasantly surprised to see that we hadn't even cracked the $50 mark.  So not counting the apps & drinks we had downstairs in the bar, our two meals (with sausage added to mine), my beer, & the dessert came to $48.93.  Great food at a reasonable price means that we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is only the second time I've been to Corrado's, and the reason I got so excited this time around was because I realized that THIS was the place where I got the best Lobster pasta! I had seen that around a year ago that I had a beautiful creamy lobster pasta that I could still remember the taste of and it was from Corrado's! I guess they may have changed their menu since the last time I've gone there, but this time I tried the Cesare pizza and Costa Azzura (sauce was a lobster cream brandy) and they were both delicious with perfect portioning! I'd love to go back for a third time. :-)"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restaurants in the Durham region. Amazing food, amazing quality, very friendly and welcoming staff and the manager is always present and always walking around talking to the customers and making sure everything is okay. It's always full when I'm in there, yet I've never waited longer than 30 minutes. They really know what they're doing! Absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Corrado's is average at best.  Service was friendly enough, but overall we were disappointed with the food and experience.  Here are the details...   - Ordered the antipasto, was not fresh.  Looked like it was pre-made and had been sitting a while.  The bread included in the dish was stale.  - We had to ask for a basket of bread.  Normally this is the first item brought out.  When they did bring it out, it was just two plain buns you could get at a grocery store, and a bit stale.  - My wife ordered the pizza, crust was chewy and undercooked  - I had the chicken parmesan.  The chicken was actually very good, along with the sauce.  For the pasta, I asked for spaghetti, they gave me spaghettini.  Not a big deal, but it was overcooked and not drained properly so when they brought the dish the sauce was watery along the edges of the plate.  - Both the pizza and pasta dish were large portions, which was good.  - Meatballs were horrible  - The dinning room itself was ok, ceiling a little high so it loses the cozy feel.  I gave them 3-stars only because they seemed to try, but just failed.  Hopefully they read this and fix their processes."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I have been here many times and  the food is consistently great. I have never had a bad meal here. I have had most of the items on the menu.  The Caesar salad, Calamari, Arrabbiata pasta, Pepperoni pizza and Don Corrado pizza are my favorite.  The owners are fantastic and take great care to provide a quality dining experience.  I really enjoy the second floor dining area which is an adults only section.  Brooklin has a lot of families so If you are planning on going here without children, I recommend going after 7:00pm on a friday or saturday night as most families will be done dinner by then."}
{"text":"Great place for our monthly ladies lunch!!  Food was excellent, especially the lasagne. Wednesday is their pasta/pizza day, great lunch special. Acoustics a little echoey, very noisy with the Christmas luncheons going on. We will be back"}
{"text":"I've been to Corrado's several times and have never been happy. I know some people seem to really like the food but I have never been happy with any meals I've had."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. If you are looking for comfort Italian food a little on the heavy side (not that that's a bad thing) check this place out.  I've been a few times and I will tell you the bar staff is a bit inconsistent. For example, not having sparkling wine available one evening. More recently, I ordered a vodka martini before my meal and another afterwards and there was BARLEY an ounce of total liquid in each. Plus each time, they were served in different style glasses.   The entrees are good and large!!! Keep that in mind as you may want to pass on the apps or dessert.   I do find that sometimes the dishes are over salted. My BF had the lasagna tonight and it was waaaaay too salty for me.   I know this all sounds negative but it is a good place but like I said, a bit inconsistent."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Very cute and romantic resturant in the heart of Brooklin off of the mail street. theyb have great italian food and pizzas. definitly worth a drive."}
{"text":"Corrados is the best restaurant in Brooklin, and surely one of the best in the Durham region. The ambient is classy but not very formal. Service is great (the owner is always watching, which is good) and the food is very honest italian food. Pasta is not overcooked, sauces are tasty and the meats well cooked. The pizza is also awesome! The cheeses they use are delicious and the crust is very thin... Ah, and they have belgium draft beer!!! Great place, thats why is almost always full for dinner, even on weekdays."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great sever I love the patios , lots of left overs so I had pizza for dinner the next day"}
{"text":"We came here with a largeish group to celebrate a few birthdays. My in-laws have raved about Corrado's forever so it was time for me to try it out.  We came in at about 6 on a weekend (we had a reservation) and while it was quiet when we arrived, it very quickly filled up to capacity. On a recommendation, I got one of their pizzas as most of the family raved about them being delicious.   Unfortunately, the wait was substantial for our food, whether that was because we were a large party of 9 or because they were busy, I'm not sure. It was a bit disappointing to watch all kinds of delicious food coming out of the kitchen going elsewhere though! It also took a while for my mother-in-law's pasta dish to come out; all the rest of us had been served and she was the last person without a dish for a few minutes.  I do have to say that everything was salty as another reviewer mentioned. It took away from the dishes as a whole unfortunately.  I'm sure we'll be back but I think this place is way overrated for what it is. The food was good but it wasn't as good as everyone is saying."}
{"text":"Had an awesome meal last night, with my stunning date: It was another venture into Corrado's creative food experience and stellar service.   ~bh"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service right from the time we entered. It was pretty packed so we had to wait 15 mins to get a table which just means they have good food which is why people come here. We ordered 2 different pastas and both exceeded my expectation specially after I had only seen a 3 star rating on Yelp before I went there."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I found this place! The customer service is excellent, and I didn't have to wait long for my food as well. At corrado's I didn't feel like I was forgotten after I was given the table. Don't get me wrong, the place was busy even with the snowstorm, but even then they made sure that my bf and I were taken care of.   I ordered Alfredo and my bf ordered the egg plant parmesan and we were both so impressed with the quality of food and service they provided.   I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and even invite them here! Definitely made a good impression on me and I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Corrados for the first time last night. WE WILL BE BACK!!! When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and seated right away. The hostess gave us the option of sitting upstairs or downstairs, we choose upstairs.   Once seated we were brought out fresh hot bread, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. I like to mix the balsamic and the oil with some parmesan cheese.   We started off with the muscles which was a very generous portion served with an excellent red sauce.   For our entree we had the Eggplant Parm and the Alfredo with Chicken. Both meals came out extremely hot and fresh.   For desert my girlfriend and I had the toffee pudding (10/10).   The service was excellent and with tip it cost us no more than $90!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is pretty eye pleasing, especially from the upstairs portion. Waitresses were friendly but couldn't seem to get simple drink orders right (asked for water with lemon and while she got it for the other person forgot mine...there were only 4 people at the table). They served bread to start things off, but it was cold. One of our dishes came cold too and had to be sent back. We all ordered pasta and meat dishes and they were quite good (after they reheated the one dish) and reasonably priced. The waitresses did pay attention to the tables and promptly cleared away finished plates as well as refreshed water glasses quickly. I think the meat plates were hearty, but if you are ordering pasta be sure to order a salad or starter - as the portions were small."}
{"text":"We were greeted wonderfully warmly and waited just 15 minutes for a table for 4. It was worth it! The service was friendly, the decor is pleasant and the food was great! DELICIOUS tiramisu (I like mine just so; not dry but not dripping, theirs was just the right consistency and sweetness for me) and $10 pizza and pasta dishes on Wednesdays?! You bet we'll be back to sit on their inviting little patio when the weather warms up! I understand the upstairs is for adults only and if you want a table up there you have get there earlier than 7:00pm. I didn't get to check out their restrooms but there is plenty of free parking in the lot. The first round of beers that came to our table were flat, but the server replaced them immediately and without any issue. It is pretty noisy as the dining room is open-concept and we were facing the bar, which was a little more brightly lit than I would have liked, but overall I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with the best waitress Sue.  She was so quick at assessing our tables needs whether it was drinks or the kids dropping crayons she was quick to pick them up. They have wonderful fresh warm Ciabatta bread. The food was great even the toddlers enjoyed their dinner. Cost was less then Applebees for 6 adults 2 kids. Definitly the better value for your dollar. We will all be back."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars.  We came for lunch on a Saturday. We were the first customers of the day, so everything we ordered was freshly made to order, including the coffee :-).    We ordered All Salmone pizza ($14) and a half pasta on cream sauce plus squash soup ($13) that was a lunch special item.  The pizza was really fresh, and the crust was thin.   There was sufficient toppings (see picture).  I really liked how the saltiness of the capers contrasted with the sweetness of the dough.  They used good cheese.  The squash soup was creamy, and surprisingly, the creamy pasta sauce was even creamier.  Considered yourself forewarned.  The pasta was delicious with lots of meat chucks.  We ordered creme brule for dessert ($7).  The portion was big and should be considered a shared dessert.  The services was very attentive and friendly.  The interior decor style is Canadian comtemporary, warm and pleasing.  The tables are spaced out enough to have an intimate conversation.  This is a nice upscale casual and, considering the environment and service, reasonably priced restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is for my takeout order of a Caesar salad with grilled chicken. The only reason I'm even giving this 2 stars is because the service was fast and the restaurant was clean and inviting.   So, my plan was to pick up my food and eat it at a park before heading back to work. That plan did not turn out the way I'd hoped. Again, this order was for takeout. I didn't receive any cutlery or napkins. So, I had to go back to work to eat my salad. The very large piece of tasteless chicken breast was whole and a tad overcooked. My lettuce was mostly brown and full of spines, crouton was soggy and the dressing was bland.   I was very disappointed with this salad for what I paid. Definitely won't be doing that again.   The place looks very inviting and the drinks looked pretty tasty. I'll have to dine in sometime and maybe I'll edit this post."}
{"text":"Good pastas and good pizza at a fair price. The parking lot is a little small though, so be careful parking around the Brooklin Moms' SUVs."}
{"text":"Food is terrible (my pizza tasted like frozen delisio from the grocery store). The pasta sauce was bland. It's definitely NOT Italian food.  When we first moved to brooklin it was good. But it's been on a steady decline for a while now and our last visit solidified it . Won't go back. The manager didn't even seem to care our food was inedible  Service was decent enough .but that doesn't make up for the quality of the food."}
