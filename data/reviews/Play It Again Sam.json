{"text":"This place is a blast. Great spot to hit on the weekend. Good local fun. Good customer service."}
{"text":"ATTENTION CUSTOMERS, STAY AWAY FROM THIS WORN DOWN CLUB WITH 60YR OLD CRACK HEAD DANCERS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! So if you are looking for \"old\" worn out crackhead dancers who spend every $1 they make into the video poker machine, this is the place to come to. There are dancers by the name of Flawless, Jasmine, Zamora and Stephanie who i heard one night all begging a customer to get them more cocaine. Amazing! I met the owner of the club Bob just once(the one time my friend took me to this club he introduced me to Bob). Bob seems like a nice guy but one of my friends that is a regular of that club(he mainly goes there 3days a week to gamble and not to buy dances) said Bob doesn't mind (and knows) that they are crack heads considering he knows they are worn out dancers that put every dollar they make into the machine since Bob caters to old worn out dancers(no wonder why there are no pretty young dancers who work here). If you are looking for more younger/prettier dancers, stick to Spearmint Rhino. So my friend who is a regular customer knows the names of the crackhead dancers so here goes the list... 1.Zamora(ugly black crackhead dancer that can never afford her buy in). 2. Flawless(fat light skinned dancer on crack).3. Jasmine(65yr old white/spanish dancer with wrinkles).4. Stephanie(68yr old white dancer crackhead with wrinkles). 5. Sintel or Cintel(60yr old crackhead dancer with blond hair and wrinkles with old lady eye makeup).6. Annabelle(Asian crackhead who is 45yrs old). The police need to raid this club. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! I'M ONLY GIVING ONE STAR BECAUSE I HAVE TO AND BECAUSE I LOVE THE BEER THEY HAVE THERE"}
{"text":"Wow Omg wow and I don't mean that in a good way . Super rude service trying to make my man and I pay 20 dollars each to get in. I was like like no way I'm a local I'm not paying to get in. So after that argument we walk in and it was so dark and smelt terrible. It was was like no other smell I had smelt before. Then it came to me cigarette smoke and the smell of a mortuary. Sad to say it but Play it Again Sams is the death row for pimped out strippers."}
{"text":"Love this place. Its definitely NOT your cheesy megaclub with 100+ girls that swarm you & hound you all night. It's the perfect combination of gentlemen's club meets little local bar. The staff is friendly & the atmosphere is relaxed.  There's a good variety of beautiful dancers: from straight-out-of-a-magazine model types to the curvier girl next door look. Another nice thing about the dancers is they aren't all bleached blonde, big fake boob valley girls: they have redheads, brunettes, blondes, white girls, black girls, Hispanic girls, Asian girls, etc.   Sam's is off the strip, across from Chinatown. They have video gaming at the bar. Happy hour drink prices from 7a-7p. Free entry for locals. They don't serve food, but you can ask the waitress or door girl for a menu to have food delivered from one of the nearby restaurants. (Flamingo pizza seems to be a big hit lol)   The stage is kind of cool because it has 2 poles. (Some of the girls are pretty good on the pole too). In addition to the couches for lap dances, they have VIP & fantasy room dances too.   If you're looking for an off the strip local's-spot type gentlemen's club, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Hottest chicks and loosest machines...just kidding but it is the most amazing strip clubs in Vegas. Never a dull moment. Make it rain on these bitches today!"}
{"text":"Went to this place last week with a friend just to check it out. Place was dead as a doornob at 9pm. Now we know why. First of all, the music was all over the place, and DJ sounded like a total novice, very unprofessional. Most of the girls are 'older' and overweight (but pretty nice though). The few younger, sexier ones are seriously stuck-up b****s. My friend got a dance from a fat girl named Zamora and her friend Anabel. They ended up being rude as hell. Now we're both dealing with bedbug problems at home. Never going back again. We heard this was a decent place, but gosh, it's a shady dive. Seems like all the girls who work here are either past their prime, or stripper-wannabe's, or can't find work in other clubs because they were banned for being total b****'s to the customers. Not recommended."}
{"text":"It's a clean bar. Kinda like the \"Cheers\" of gentlemen's clubs. The bartender Kevin was charming. The girls were fun. Perfect for couples."}
{"text":"CLEARLY ALL THE REVIEWS LEFT ARE FROM EMPLOYEES..... This place is a total shithole.....Reminds me of The wild wild west casino on Tropicana. .. \"Whoever is running this place should be arrested\" for being a complete \"pimp\" this is a 24 hour hoe house pretty much.... The bartenders \"kevin\" \"bruce\" and \"hunter\"(hopefully I didn't slaughter spelling on any of there names) are very nice nd pleasant to talk too....  \"You know a Strip club sucks when u enjoy the company of male Bartenders and Boyd gaming more then the dancers\".....smdh....!  The only reason I ever ended up in a world class dump like this is because A friend of mine told me to \"Go in Sams\" I can get a cheap drink and a pretty decent blow job for a very \"efficient price\".....Wrong....! I should have knew that wasnt gonna be a good idea with the words \"Cheap and \"efficient\" together.....  There IS not tht many woman under 40 there.... Ex: *The doorwoman (can't call her doorgirl she is the same age as my grandma) *The dancers (3 under 45) *The waitresses (they have big tits but are a 101 years old between the two of them)  A Word of advice go somewhere else....  this place should be shutdown and turnt into something useful.... Like a better strip club That's all folks till next time"}
{"text":"This place is a dump! The girls are long past their prime and some never has a prime. I mean you actually want to give some of the girls  $$ to keep their tops ON.  So when you drive by and see the sign at the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn, KEEP DRIVING- do not stop unless you really, really want to waste your time and money."}
{"text":"They don't take off drinks for playing machines and not one girl approached my boyfriend and me. I would have been happy to buy him a lap dance."}
{"text":"I came into Play it Again Sam Cabaret with my boyfriend. Very relaxed casual atmosphere.Not the usual hustle of other strip clubs. Enjoyed the happy hour drink prices and the video poker. The girls were very nice and quite attractive."}
{"text":"Some cute girls, some pushy; standard small club stuff.  Cute bartender, but somewhat elitist.  A few times it seemed I had to earn her attention to get a drink.  Friday night, 8pm or so, that's a shitty attitude.  Twice as I was trying to get a drink, she walked over to new people at the bar.  Regulars or not, what happened to my order?"}
{"text":"If your looking for a 150 girl lineup Play It Again Sam is not for you. Sam's is a smaller venue with cheap drinks and a lineup that usually consists of about 20 girls. The DJ Chris plays good music and the manager John is super cool and very approachable. The bartenders are on top of their game and the machines are real loose and pay out."}
{"text":"The parking lot at this local strip joint is always full, but the inside is never packed. The best time to come is during happy Hour where all drinks are half off ($3.50 beer) from 7am to 7pm. No cover charge and usually a nice bartender on hand as well. Yes the attractiveness of the women are not Rhino quality, but lately the crop of talent has been quite good. IT's been around for years and is one of only two or three strip joints where you can gamble. Most of the time, the girls aren't hovering around you like the Big Boys, but you can actually have a conversation and not be pressured to purchase a $20 dance (most of the time). The kitchen closed a few years ago and the Monday Night Football buffet usually leaves a bit to be desired, but overall this is a solid local strip joint with friendly dancers and a cool attitude and vibe to match. Last night there were about six or seven dancers and several of them had some crazy great moves on the pole and others had great moves in general. With the NBA finals on the TV or other sports , SAm's is always worthy of a visit at any time of the year."}
{"text":"I love this place! The girls are hot and the beer is cold. The girls are fun and do fun stuff. I can't even believe its legal!  My only complaint is that my wife found the seat of my truck covered in stripper glitter. They need to install some sort of vacuum system in the parking lot to avoid such disasters."}
{"text":"Good happy hour prices and the girls aren't pressuring you to buy dances. Kinda divey...but overall not horrible. Some of the dancers are slightly long in the tooth, others should cut down on the carbs a little. Not a bad place to grab a couple of drinks with your buddies after work."}
{"text":"Went in last week because it was one of the few strip clubs in Vegas I had not visited yet. Went during a week day. Glad I checked it out. Very laid back atmosphere and girls were very cute and sexy. The staff, security, and girls were all friendly and never tried to hustle me. Did not have to pay a cover and no one mentioned a drink requirement. Also wanted to add in, this club was very couples friendly. Had no problem bringing my wife here. Overall I would recommend this place over some of the bigger clubs in Vegas, much better bang for your buck and less stressful. I will be adding this place as one of my regular stops."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Small venue which I was hoping for. Jacqueline is so cool."}
{"text":"Went in on a slow Monday night, midway between point A & B. No cover for an out-of-towner. (Maybe before 7pm) Bartender, Jeff, made me feel like a regular as soon as I sat down. Dancer, Hunter, took a personal interest. Made me want to treat her like well. Place is small, has a neighborhood bar feel, not the ultra lounge celebrity worshiping vibe of the strip, exactly what I was looking for. Good reviews if you go in knowing what you are going to get."}
{"text":"Service industry happy hour prices on Sunday is nice. Bartender is great. Drinks are cheap, but you need some PBR. Girls are nice and DO NOT Pressure you into dances. No cover. The perfect dive bar that has boobies. If you want to complain about the girls then go to the highend clubs, these girls are great for the location and price.   EDIT: They DO NOT let in females without a male companion. LAME."}
{"text":"Omg!! The girls here are beautiful!! So sweet.. manager is so handsome and so customer service oriented.  What a cool Local hang out.. I'm Going To Be back forsure! !!  Video poker..stunning dancers. What more do you want?? I'm in heaven. .."}
{"text":"Had a little too much fun here last night!  Took advantage of their happy hour which did me in--but you can't beat it (starts from 7:00 at night and goes til 7:00 in the morning)!  Great prices, sexy friendly ladies and gaming.  Great time."}
{"text":"Cool, laid back club.  Friendly, non-pushy people.  Cheap drinks.  A relief from the big, overpriced tourist trap clubs."}
{"text":"Girls are not the greatest, a few of them barely show what they got even when on the main stage, those corsets be hiding the damaged goods!!! A few of the other reviews say cheap drinks- $7 for a jack n coke is cheap? A few of the girls there tonight had terrible attitudes! This black haired one, who didn't even take her top off while dancing on the stage was the worst!! I forget her name but she's not important and over the hill, time to go to real estate school honey buns. The big guy named Chris was cool. Talked to him for a minute, seems like a solid dude. Won't be back tho, so I wish him well, and only him."}
{"text":"The one bartender with the bucked bunny teeth has the worst attitude, as if she is cute enough to even act like that. This place is a hole in the wall that stinks like vinegar and cigs. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Do not go here, you will be very very sorry...this is a Gentlemens club slash bar with ugly dancing Girls!  Please Pass!   Yikes..scared me bad one day!!  It used to be a great bar for food, I am sure it still is...but I am warning you, don't go'  Enjoy  your life!  On the other hand, if you are looking for a nasty strip club an are going for the bar crawl, or want to hit the dive-iest bar in vegas...go then! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Walk in and 2 seconds later the \"lady\" at her front says rudely \"Can I help you?\" I say \"Can I get a drink?\" She says \"You have to bring a guy in.\" Who the hell makes that rule?? Who said I won't buy my own dance?? APPARENTLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DICK TO GET IN THIS \"BAR\" PEOPLE! Wtf. Shitty place anyway. 0 our of 100 stars. Rude."}
{"text":"Video poker, topless dancers, 7 am to 7pm happy hour, the DJ is amazing, best party location in Vegas...enough said"}
{"text":"When drinking, strip clubs sound great don't they? This one was down the street so i went. On a Friday night i expected it to be busy, it wasn't. It also didn't have the best talent walking around either.  The girl on the stage looked intoxicated and didn't really do, much. She shimmed a bit. Now i'm a girl btw. So I'm no perv. But i could have done better up there.  I did convince two girls two smile, helped one with her bra and made one girl's night by buying the horrible drink she recommended, Vodka tonic. A lap dance later from a busty at the seams woman named Daisy (yep i'll called her out) I wanted to drink somewhere else. Luckily I made it out with no viral diseases.."}
{"text":"This is an awesome dive bar, beers cold, music is always goin, the dancers are friendly, bar tenders are attentive, the manager John is the man. But most of all the cocktail waitress Shelby is a rock star, a personality for days, a chest that makes you look twice. The kinda girl that could make a guy want to marry her. Will certainly be back"}
{"text":"Had a great time until one of the dancers charged my roommate for twice as many dances as he received. my phone also came up missing and when I brought this up to the owner he was unhelpful. Most likely my phone was stolen by one of the employees. the manager actually said to me.. \"You shouldn't lose your phone.\" we were the only two customers there."}
{"text":"Topless bar, one of many in Vegas....nice size, since im a girl there was no cover, locals get discounts if not free, girls were pretty not so pretty, but friendly.  There wasnt enough females for the size of place.  Full bar though. Atmoshphere was comfotable, definitlely a good place to bring your girlfriend/wife if you want to boost her confidence. I was with 3 males, that were young & goodlooking considering the others, but Im guessing since we didnt feel anybody was worrth spending money on they didnt want any part...All i have to say is, \"make me want to give you all my money, bitch!!\""}
{"text":"It's a titty bar, across the street from dim-sum and around the corner from the shooting range. What more could you ask for? Actually, it feels more like a regular bar, which is good."}
{"text":"If I can give it a ZERO, I would. The DJ, worst customer service EVER.....  I'm in the industry and 0"}
{"text":"As long as I lived here, I've never been here. As many times I've driven past. Even when I first moved here. Because...the name of a strip club...Play it Again Sam....Yea....Not really rolling off your tongue type of name. But they have food....Mmmmm Would you eat Fried Pickles at a strip club? Yea....who's pickles? What made me stop in was the amount of cars in the parking lot. Ok so locals are free. That's a plus...Drinks are cheap. Another Plus....I had Belvedere rocks for 6 somethin? That's not bad. There is gaming. However, service kinda sucked. I spent about sixty bucks in the video poker and 1 comped drink because the bartender is SSsssllooowww. What is he looking at too much ass? Because there's not a lot in there. Ok so I liked 4 of the girls there. Well plus the nerdy goth waitress....hehehe whatever...she wants some big Myke. Mwahaha....But no I didn't give it up. It's actually a cool locals joint - mostly people were there drinking and eating, chillin and talking. Not a bad place. I had to knock it for service and quality of girls. But then again. I don't think it's that kind of club.  There are some perks. I mean it's not completely dark. Which is good - so the lapdances you're getting you can at least tell if it's Chewbacca or a random MAN. At least when you're getting a dance you're not like \"oh your boobs on my face feel nice\" er...\"no that's my elbow you're feeling\"  Awkward.... Hmmm.  Definitely an experience to check it out."}
{"text":"Directly across the street from the Tiki Bar was this place. Which was conveniently directly across another street from a Bank of America. So, I withdrew a hundred dollars after Tiki Bar. It was Christmas Eve, and I was giving myself that one present you get to open that night.      I paid a ten dollar cover charge, and walked in. The place was dark, neon, mirrorey, and fairly empty, but it was open. Even in the dim lighting, I could see a handful of girls working the customers at the bar. To my left, the stage, and all the seats near it were empty, and I decided the safest (and cheapest) place to sit would be right by it. I sat down, ordered a cold bud light. (another ten dollars) Almost in response to my sitting down, an announcer called a girl to the stage. It was there I met Valentina.       She was nice, she was kind. She was showing most of what she had up on stage. She danced. I gave her money. After she danced on stage for a few songs, she came and chatted with me. She took me to the back area where we could chill and chat....and I also gave her more money for private dances. Eventually, I did run out of my allotted stripper money. I thanked her, wished her a Merry Christmas, and then left the place.      This year I spent way longer in a strip club that I did last year! Like nearly a full hour!  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Play it Again Sam is one of those special little slices of heaven nestled in Chinatown. I frequent this club because it is clean, well priced, great bartender Bruce, and amazing girls.  Lots of new dancers including Lotis who is gorgeous. She makes the dollars fly out of your wallet. Can't wait to go back!"}
