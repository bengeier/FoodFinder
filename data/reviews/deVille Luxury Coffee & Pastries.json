{"text":"It was a good cafe. 
Went there for a first date, and it was great atmosphere. 
Would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were in the Bridgeland area and wanted brunch. She didn't want to wait anywhere so we settled on Deville since there were many open seats available. 
I have to say that this place is just so cute. I love the d√©cor and the overall space in general is lovely.  We both ordered skim cappuccinos and they arrived with pretty art in the foam (and were quite delicious too!

I was a bit disappointed by the choices for brunch - although the options all sounded wonderful, where are the healthy choices? Everything listed reads really rich with ingredients.... Which can be a good thing but when you just want something light it's discouraging to want to eat here.

My friend ordered the stuffed French toast with Peanut Butter & Banana \"finished with caramel drizzle\" I have to say that it looked beautifully sinful and she said it was great. Since I wanted to have something light but substantial I ordered the House Made Granola which came with Greek yogurt and fresh fruit (I asked them to sub out the honey) when mine arrived it looked and tasted great but.... It was just not what I thought it would be- it was very heavy and not a light choice at all.

I really enjoyed my time here and would love to go back for some wine but maybe only for food when I want to splurge on my nutrition - unless they incorporate some healthier options."}
{"text":"FINALLY made it here for a java while in the Bridgeland area. Part of me misses living here as places like this keep popping up! Went in and we ordered a wet capp (they only come this way apparently, which I love!) and a chai latte and they were accommodating for making it less sweet. (1/2 sweet they call it) The barista was super nice. I liked the sleek look of the place and the candles everywhere, on the tables and windows sills - would make for a great date place at night. The owner was there and hands on which was great to see and he made sure to ask us how our coffees were. We also shared a large chocolate chip cookie which is made on site. They have an executive chef in the house! What separates them from the downtown location I was told is that they have table service. Love it - although we did not need it on this date but I would be curious on another visit to see a menu and try something. The washroom was clean but low on toilet paper, out of soap and paper towels. Easy fixes. 
I liked it here a lot and will return. Still sad I missed the Yelp event here but I will make up for it :)"}
{"text":"Some friends and I went to deVille for a small bite to eat and a glass of wine.  The food served tapas style was so delicious we decided we needed to try absolutely everything on the menu.   We have a really enjoyable evening and the food was outstanding.  
I don't think I need to mention the coffee, everyone knows their latte's are outstanding."}
{"text":"More often than not sleep alludes me and I find myself needing a jolt of java at the most unusual times during the day.  Was downtown and heading North so I decided to go via deVille in search of something to tantalize my taste buds for the ride home.

An Iced Chai Latte jumped off the menu board at me and a spinach/feta scone in the bakery case was calling my name.  Loved the decor and friendliness of the staff.  So quaint and inviting.

The iced chai latte was simply delicious but I probably wouldn't order the scone again unless the spinach was chopped before going into the scone.  Every bite had me fighting to chew through strands of spinach & stem which made for a very messy affair.  Fortunately I was alone on my drive home and only had my messy self to contend with.  The latte made everything better in the end.

Lovely establishment and one I will return to again to try something new."}
{"text":"What a cute little place!!

I missed out on the Yelp event that was held here, so I was really excited to try it out with Raissa R. on Friday. I love the space - so bright, modern, and inviting! I love the close proximity to downtown without all the traffic and expensive parking. 

We settled on two glasses of wine, as well as the Sundried Tomato & Goat Cheese Flatbread, and a selection of 3 cheeses and charcuterie. Although they were out of the wine Raissa ordered, the waitress brought over two different ones to try. The sauv blanc we both had was delicious! The flatbread was quite good, loaded with goat cheese and tomatoes, but it could have used some sweetness to balance out those heavy flavors. A truffled honey or balsamic reduction would make this dish 5*!!

After selecting a few meats & cheeses, we were a little surprised when the plate arrived with blue cheese on it - neither of us like blue cheese - so we asked what it was. She told us it was the blue gorgonzola, which is listed just as \"gorgonzola\" on the board. A little misleading. She replaced it with no issue, but I really wished she would have taken the time to explain what each item on the board was and what paired with what. A little disappointing.

Overall, I loved the food and the space is super cute, so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I swear... I was only coming in for a cup of coffee. I saw the sign outside advertising the stuffed French toast, but I wasn't going to give in. Just some coffee and wifi, get through the emails I was having a hard time focusing on at home and then I was done.

Why does nothing ever pan out the way I plot it in my head when avoiding delicious food is concerned? Before I knew it, I was seated at a table right across from the kitchen with a menu in one hand and an Americano in the other. So much for the plan.

The girl with the spotted tattoo on her shoulder suggested the braised pork stuffed French toast. She said it was the most popular one. \"With good reason,\" I remember thinking as I sunk my teeth in for bite after bite. 

Are you wondering what stuffed French toast is like yet? At deVille, it's a baguette turned French toast, then grilled in a panini press with all of the fillings. Yum.

From my seat I could see them preparing each of the dishes back in the kitchen. While I was waiting for mine, the chef walked out and asked the table of three women next to me what they thought of their meal. He then launched into a conversation with them about how it was made. It's not every Calgary joint where the chef makes such a direct effort to connect with those eating his food. 

My stuffed French toast was delivered by him a few moments later. I made one mistaken attempt to eat my French toast with a fork and knife. It should come with a wetnap. This sammy (it is a sammy after all) is meant to be a hands on experience in my yelpy opinion. Halfway through, I happened to glance up and caught the eye of my dear sammy creator. He gave me a thumbs up with a questioning look. Was it a-ok? You bet your boots it was. 

Brunch is served at deVille in Bridgeland 7 days a week until 2pm.

If you didn't get this from the rest of my review, I'm a fan of the braised pork stuffed French toast."}
{"text":"I really like the bright atmosphere.  It feels very trendy and is a lovely place to eat breakfast.  However, I struggled to find something I was excited about.  The brunch selection is a tad deficient as far as I'm concerned and there isn't much in the way of a low key, inexpensive morning meal.  Sometimes I feel like I have to stuff my face to justify ordering a $15 plate at 9am.  I ended up trying the Smoked Chicken Hash, which really was delicious.  I took home leftovers.  Everyone's meal was well presented.  Our server was fairly scarce but thankfully we weren't in a rush.  

Don't pay for street parking if you don't have to.  There's free parking a block south."}
{"text":"I love that there's a great coffee bar in Calgary that's NOT downtown.  This is much easier to get to without dealing with the traffic and parking issues of downtown.

It's deVille, so of course I had the Nutella Latte.  Delicious without being overpowering--it's still a latte.  There was a Metric song playing, so bonus points there.  It looks like it might be a great place to hang out and have some drinks (coffee or alcoholic), although it needed a few more people there.  There were a lot of tables with just one dude sitting at them.

I'll be back (though if I do, I'll either be in a group or won't sit solo at a table)."}
{"text":"This place is HIP and HAPPENIN!  Located where Heartland Cafe used to be, this new and exciting addition to Bridgeland is sure to please all coffee drinkers and hipsters alike!

Their nutella latte is to diiiie for but comes with a hefty $5 price tag for a large.  This is a great place as a treat once in awhile but I don't quite think they're giving Blue Star Diner a run for their money just yet.

I ordered the Bacon Benny, and welll..... was underwhelmed to say the least.  Eggs were cooked soft (prefer medium) but was not asked.  The eggs, etc. were UNDERseasoned and the side of potatoes were OVERseasoned, it just wasn't a good balance and with no salt or pepper in sight.  The bacon was fatty, and when the bill came I couldn't believe it was $16.  Bitch, please.  That is way too much spenny for underwhelming Eggs Benny and 6 tater tots, I'm sorry.  Meanwhile, next to me the lady was eating the French Toast equivalent to \"50 Shades of Gray\".  I seriously almost asked her if she wanted to be alone with her brunch.  I had brunch-ordering remorse.  Next time I'll get the stuffed french toast for sure.  Hard to top the staff and those lattes though, keep up the good work !  (But please revisit the eggs benny...)"}
{"text":"..went back again to try brunch. Service was fantastic and the food was great. We had a Strawberry and Brie French toast (on Baguette) and a frittata with chicken (and Boursin cheese). Both were quite delicious - not to mention the Nutella and Baileys Latte - Really good!! 

I feel I might have to come back again..

See pics posted."}
