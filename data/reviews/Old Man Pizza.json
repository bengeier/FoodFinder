{"text":"Decided to try the fried chicken at this place just to see if I could put it on the \"guilty pleasures\" list.  Never again.  The chicken was undercooked, and pink. As a result, the drumsticks were sinewy, and inedible. I'm still searching for Toronto's best fried chicken."}
{"text":"If you want pizza, you want it cheap, and you want it fast - you've got Old Man. Where else can you get a pizza and wings, with a side of drinks for under $20? The pizza isn't the best I've ever had but I never regret it. Hey - at that price point, it can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place in Parkdale while visiting family/friends in the area. They have a fun menu of some unique pizza formulations (chili cheese fries style, for example -- which everyone loved), as well as the standard fare. They even made an off-menu meat-lover's style pie (I think it was called the Carnosaurus), which was also super tasty and didn't last long once it got home. Extra bonus, they had some sweet house-made donuts to bring home for dessert. Thanks to the friendly guys behind the counter, I'll be back next time I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I generally get Old Man Pizza delivered. They have awesome 2 pizza deals, cheaper than the big chains. I once had two large 4 topping pizzas delivered for under $20 - you can't beat that! The only thing that kept me from making this a five-star rating is that I wish that there was a bigger variety of toppings, particularly green vegetables (the only green veggie is green pepper, and like jalapeno and sometimes spinach or broccoli)."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the absolute best pizza places I have ever been to.  The place is on some dingy side street, tucked away, and the name isn't all that appealing either, but once you get in there, you're in for a treat!  The best deals come from the walk-in specials; you can order it- they deliver super-fast and free of charge, but if you want it as fresh as it gets, stay in.  The decor sucks, let's face it... you're in PARKDALE... but the food, it makes you forget you're dodging bullets on the outside.  The wings are made to order: I like them super crispy, and that's how they're made.  The panzerotti are also made just the way you want.  My personal favourite is a pepperoni, bacon, mushroom with extra sauce.  Mmmmm!  OMP is one of the reasons I miss Parkdale... actually, just that really."}
{"text":"Still a fan of the place, Old Man has re-arranged his furniture twice in the past year, and offers a more diverse selection of food now, including deli salads (potato, macaroni, and coleslaw I believe), papadums (4 for 1 dollar, highly recommended), very good (but more expensive) fried fish, and I'll also recommend the Zinger burger which is absolutely not what you expect in taste. I don't even need to get pizza from him any more, even though I do, but he has a very good selection of food, and like I said in my previous review, you'd have to go in and see what he's got, because he might have more stuff I'm missing during the day than at night (which is when I always go), and he may not do the same food every day. That's why I like this place, you can pop in and see what's there, and pick something. I like getting pizza slices and papadums. Very satisfying."}
{"text":"So let's be straight about this: The 5 stars are not because this is the best pizza I've ever had in my life.   The five stars are because this is the best extra large pizza I've ever had for $8.99 CAD.   When I saw the prices, I thought the menu must be out of date or the sizes must be wonky (no inches listed left me a little concerned). But no - XL is XL - and the price is right. I walked in with my boyfriend and we ordered in person, then sat inside and waited for 15 minutes until our pizza was served. You CAN NOT beat this price and the quality is certainly better than some similarly-priced chain places."}
{"text":"Old Man has the coolest pizzas! Great selection of tasty vegan and vegetarian options with zany topping like nacho pizza (yes, with actual nachos on top) to their spring roll or just a classic cheese."}
{"text":"The facilities are a bit dingy, but the mom and pop who run this little place are lovely, and you can't beat a slice & pop for $2.50.  My pizza had a fresh, homemade feel."}
{"text":"Very good serviceable pizza. Probably can't be beat. XL Pizza with about 5-6 toppings, + ordered 6 wings for $5.55. Total bill was only about $22.00.   Wings were small and over cooked, but they did apologize they were having an issue with the fryer. The coating was good. They do the wings the same as their fried chicken in a butter milk coating. And I imagine that on a better day these would be really good. They had a choice of Franks Red Hot or their special sauce. I was lead to believe the special sauce was going to be spicier. But it was closer to straight Kraft Chicken & Rib BBQ sauce. Not what I expected but was good regardless. Don't go here for gourmet delights, but if you want quick, cheap pretty good pizza that beats the chains give it a try. I do want to try their fried chicken. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My all time favourite pizza joint in Toronto. I live nearby so I am biased here but I have also lived all over the city and spent time in Italy. The pizza is authentic, fresh, just amazing and much better than any chain restaurant. . . Unbelievably inexpensive, and the staff is so friendly you just want to eat there every day. They are also some of the hardest working people in the neighboorhood, with awesome late night hours, often open on holidays. When I have my friends down for some drinks they always agree the food and service is incredible and they always wish they had one near by.   The food is fresh, hot and ready in record speed . . Though I've never had them deliver, it blows my mind that they are able to keep up with quick delivery times and in store takeout. They deserve a 5 star review and I hope their business continues to expload! You will not be dissapointed! It's a Toronto 'inner' secret for sure."}
{"text":"24 nov 2017, 9;30 pm ET read the reviews, decided to give it another shot, after not having been for 2 years  electric sign in  window proudly saying 'open' place was closed  fool me once, shame on you fool me twice, shame on  me"}
{"text":"This place is truly a Parkdale gem. The new ownership has not only overhauled the brand, but also the pizza! What used to be alright pizza is now some of the best Pizza to be found in the neighbourhood. They have lots of cool new flavours, but still do the classics really well. Best part? The prices are still crazy cheap so you can get great pizza for next to nothing."}
{"text":"We called Old Man Pizza for delivery at 9 p.m. on a Sunday, but the driver was already done for the day so we had to go pick it up. You pretty much know what you're getting yourself into when you order pizza from a ma and pa shop located on a sketchy stretch of parkdale. It's not going to be the best, but it surprisingly also wasn't the worst.  This pizza has a thin and crispy crust with just the right amount of cheese. It was tasty and didn't leave me feeling sick and gross after like a lot of pizza does these days, but the toppings were limited and more old school (aka old man pizza!). I shared a Canadian and I did enjoy it, but they didn't have any marinara dipping sauce so I was partially sad.  While waiting for our pizza, we were entertained by a Bollywood awards show while a sole man made our pizza and handled the restaurant all by himself. I found the waiting area quite scuzzy (location, duh!).   Though there was nothing really wrong with this pizza (it was simple, light and AFFORDABLE!!!), I still wasn't the biggest fan. I may try the panzos in the future as they come highly recommended by fellow yelpers, but I'm not so sure I'll return for the pizza unless I'm feeding a bunch of people on the cheap at a party."}
{"text":"I am not sure why I never went to this place and always went to Pizza Pizza - it was recommended to me and I never went there. Until I had to meet a friend who was dead set against Pizza Pizza.  The one reason I stopped going to pizza places is because the panzorotti quality have gone down and I can never find one satisfying. They seem to always be premade and warming it in an oven just doesn't do it.  Anyway.  Nobody goes here for the none- existent decor. They go for the super duper cheap deals - you can take all your change there and get yourself a filling meal- and the mom and pop that run the joint are kind and won't frown at your mound of change. They won't even charge you until you're done eating your food.  I have tried almost everything on their small menu - wings, pizza, chicken fingers and fries - were all very good - but most amazing is there 10\" panzo, freshly made. It's possibly the most expensive single item and takes the longest but my goodness it is big, filling and delicious. Unlike the dinky and deflated one from Pizza Pizza. Another side note is that the waiting time for me is almost nonexistent thanks to the endless amount of Bollywood music videos that play - I always find that it's hard to be a grump with such cheerful, colourful  and beautiful distraction.  If for nothing else you must try the panzo."}
{"text":"Love the potato pizza (crazy concept, right?!). But tastes amazing. My hubbie & guests loved the Butter Chicken (wow, more crazy - but best of both worlds combined onto a tasty cornmeal crust). Cheese pizza was a hit. Loved the option to have beef pepperoni (never seen this before - nice option & highly appreciated).  Great 'za! Definitely ordering for our next party!!"}
{"text":"My usual pizza place is closed for a few days So decided to try this other nearby spot. Order for delivery a special. During order person was kinda rude and they didn't have 2 basic items I wanted. Delivery time was fine but they burnt mg pizza when I asked for it lightly cooked. Also toppings had shifted all over the place cheese all over the place.. No good. Chicken wings were awful and a hit dog bun that I think was garlic bread???? Also for 25 bucks I can get another pizza, potato wedges, 2 more drinks and A dipping sauce at Cece's pizza! Not to mention how much better it is! No pizza till they open again!"}
