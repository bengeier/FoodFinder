{"text":"Herminie is a tiny borough in the middle of Sewickley Township, Pa.  It is a coal town that is decades past its boomtown roots that once made this part of the Allegheny Mountains the place where robber barons made their fortunes. It may have seen better days, but Herminie is far from a ghost town.  Right down in the center of the main street sits a cultured pearl of a restaurant that has been slinging breakfast hash and strong java for many decades.    Palace Lunch is both an iconic luncheonette, and a well oiled time machine.  Step in. Grab a booth or stool at the counter.  Strap in.  Get ready for a hot trip back to 1948.  They cook morning grub the old fashioned way - huge quantities of eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese, and the best hash brown taters I ever ate.  Coffee strong and smooth enough to drown your fatigue in caffeine.    My Palace Omelet with Sausage in place of ham, was an amazement.  Fresh, locally sourced sausage, three eggs, onions, peppers, American cheese that covered half the large plate, with the rest of the space loaded with seriously grilled and nicely burnt edge potatoes with just enough grease to complete a heavenly meal.  There was no way I was going to be able to eat it all...until I did.  It was the best omelet I had eaten in years, and I was not going to stand up until it was completely consumed (even if I didn't eat another meal until tomorrow).    All that and great interactions with fellow diners and the staff behind the counter.  People were happy to talk about Palace Lunch, as well as their lives in this community. Pictures on the walls of family and high school football heroes of the Yough School District.    Prices?  Just added to the fun.  Under $10, including tip.  Value? Beyond compare."}
