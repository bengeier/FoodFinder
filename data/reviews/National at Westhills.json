{"text":"What are you looking for in a restaurant in the suburbs?  If it's lots of beer and a beer hall atmosphere you are going to love National Westhills.  The downtown beer hall comes to a neighbourhood near you with its long tables and benches and incredible craft beer selection.  There are currently 72 brands of craft beer from small North American breweries on tap.  Pretty impressive.  All the draught is one price so you can make a decision based on appeal alone.  You can get a glass for $6, pint for $8.5, stein for $14 or a flight for $15. One interesting selection is a mead from Fallentimber.  A family honey business turned meadery in Water Valley, Alberta.  Sitting down we could find no kids'menu and the National fare is not sympathetic to young picky eaters.  While we love the oyster bar, charcuterie, beet & goat cheese salad, clam chowder, glory bowl, and lobster sliders our kids were uncertain of most of the content.  Enter macaroni and cheese minus the beef short rib & oxtail ragu.  Our kids also enjoyed the popcorn and tater tots with ranch.  The newest National location has a few hiccups that will be smoothed with time.  The servers, who seemed to be just kids themselves, approached us like apologetic fawns.  While we were in the washroom our server cleared my unfinished beer and Nancy's Q water.  She had some water in her glass and one third of the bottle remaining before it was swiftly removed in our absence.  If your kids are foodies and Grandma is limber enough to swing a leg over a bench or sit at a bar height table you will have some fun family times at National Westhills.  Otherwise get a sitter and knock back one of the craft beers with your buddies."}
{"text":"We stopped by here to get dinner before watching a movie at the Cineplex across the road. I'm going to cut right to it: the food was terrible. My $20 fish tacos were fishy and had plasticky tortillas, and my salad was limp, over-dressed and warm. My friend's poutine was cold and had some seriously over-browned fries. We are a hungry crew, and none of us finished our dinners. About the only edible thing was the pretzels and beer cheese dip.  I've been to the other two locations (10th and 17th), and the interior of this place looks much like a copy of the National on 17th. The beer list is different, but the prices are the same - $8.50 for most pints. Unlike 17th, you can't do any people-watching out the window, but there is ample parking."}
{"text":"The handful of times I've been there I found the food quality and service to be consistently good. I don't venture here on the weekends so maybe it's not as busy when I do go. Nice place for a beer and late dinner/snacks. They have some pretty awesome specials too (the oysters are surprisingly really good)."}
{"text":"We went in on a Sunday at  Noon.  Had a Clive burger and fish tacos. The burger was good but the fries were all short less then 2 lnchs long and over crisp  like they were scraped from the bottom.  The fish tacos were good but the size of the fish was smaller then the taco by half making this more of a salad taco then fish. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I was surprised that the prices were actually pretty reasonable for good food, and I especially liked that you could order 3, 5 oz beers for about the same price as a pint.  Great to be able to sample the large myriad of craft beers they have available."}
{"text":"Food = 4 stars Service = 2 stars  Burgers were really good. VERY limited menu selection, a lot of deep fried food. This is definitely more of a bar than anything else. Surprisingly a lot of kids at lunch hour (a Saturday). Service is SLOW. Chairs & benches are hard. Community tables are not my thing. Unless we really want a burger and are in the area we probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Went with some friends for some drinks overall service was good... But the smell inside the restaurant was nasty, I was lucky that it was a some what nice evening that we were able to sit outdoors, the outdoor  heater was broken over our table so we ended up leaving a lot sooner than expected. I don't think I would go back to this location."}
{"text":"Second visit to this location, the first time the service was very slow. Took 15 min before someone took our beer order then another 10 before it arrived. Thirsty on the patio!!!!!!  I thought we would try again, arrived to a busy restaurant and waited 25 minutes while 2 large picnic tables sat empty apparently \"reserved\". I guess guaranteed business isn't important. We walked out and the staff were very fine with that. Speaks volumes....  The service sucks, this location won't last if it continues."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time was for 'buck a shuck' on Monday nights...and both the service and the food was great. I ordered a flatbread and absolutely loved it. I've been known to have the odd wobbly pop so I enjoy the great selection of beer available here at National Westhills. I enjoy bringing pubs, I enjoy bringing my kids to pubs but then again they are teenagers more than 3 year olds and they know how to behave in public. Enough said. I like that there is ample parking here... but one thing that I do not like about National Westhills are the horrible uncomfortable benches and chairs. They obviously don't want you to stick around and 'drink the menu' so to speak. On our second visit I ordered the Fish Tacos. They were just okay. Hubby had the all day omelet which he loved but it was huge! There must have been at least four eggs in there. Our son, who was extremely hungry after football, really enjoyed his burger and he said the fries were some of the best he's had. I like National Westhills because it's got a great selection of beer and because you can bring the whole family. I can't wait to bring the teens for buck a shuck night.  If only they would change the chairs...."}
{"text":"Beer selection is dynamite.  3/4 of menu is deep fried. Staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place to come for drinks with friends, either inside or on the spacious patio. We came here for Wing wednesday (1 lb. wings $5) to watch the hockey game, but it was beyond packed inside & there were tables available out on the patio.   My friend had a couple of steamwhistles while I opted for a refreshing bombay&tonic. We settled on the hot, honey garlic and Salt N' Pepa wings, which were actually pretty tasty and a good value. The dill dip accompanying the wings was excellent!  Our server was quick to take our food and drink orders, check on us and offer refills.. I don't recall her name, but she was efficient and friendly, even though she was clearly very busy.   I like National Westhills and will return to this location again. My only minor peeve is that it's open to children as well. Adults-only might be more appropriate in a beerhall setting.. Just sayin' ;)"}
{"text":"Hmmm, typically decent but recently it hasn't been great.  Service was good but food took way too long 45mjn plus for fish tacos, fried chicken and porchetta sand.  Chicken and tacos were good, Porchetta was barely edible - Grease, on grease, grease.  Heavily buttered bun, pesto with oil, mayo and then a patty pork."}
{"text":"Great food and 60 beers.  Four of us went there after an afternoon movie.  The restaurant itself is clean and fresh looking, with a nice style.  There is an outdoor patio as well.  I had the chicken fried rice which was excellent.  It included a half chicken with the delicious rice.  The people that I was with enjoyed their meals as well.  While we did not have any beer, we will most definitely return to try that.  I was impressed with the staff, who were knowledgable and friendly.  The service was efficient and without issue.    Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Not bad not great but just good....and by that I mean just. We ordered the potato and bacon pizza and fried chicken and rice. The pizza was dry, had little to no bacon and the slices of potato were under cooked. The rice wanted to be a stir fry and a roasted dinner at the same time. The broccoli was overdone and the carrots underdone. The rice wasn't fried and the chicken was dry. Admittedly we are food snobs so can't be too hard, the beer was cold and the hockey game was on. The food was a good portion and seasoned well. We ate, we talked and we left and we may be back....maybe."}
{"text":"Been to all the nationals in Calgary. The one at lWesthills use to be my favourite. We gave it one more try last night. Thursday, Aug. 24th. That was a mistake! Hostess was awesome. The waitress started off good. But unfortunately that was the end of the service. It took for ever to order then checked to see how it was.(I do understand when it's busy that's tough to do. It wasn't that busy) After we finished eating we sat with bowls that needed a take away containers for close?  to 40 minutes. We had to ask for the bill, waited for her to bring the machine so we could pay. Then we had money on the table for a tip she proceeded to take that and pocket that in front of us. (That's new) will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Had the beer &  burger special, partner had the fish tacos. All good,  hot,  and served well."}
{"text":"Came for the Sunday brunch and the kidlympics.  It was busy had reserved our seat was seated by the friendly hostess.  It was busy and was not approached by a server for over 10 mins until I asked someone in passing if they would take my order.  She was very nice and offered me a drink for waiting.  I just ordered drinks for the kids instead unfortunately she did not get it right, I could not get her attention I had to ask the hostess to change it.  She also charged it even though she offered me a drink for the wait.  Waited quite some time for the food... they want fast turnover for the numerous people standing at the door but the service was very slow. Food was just ok.  The kids had fun with the activities."}
{"text":"A good pub experience. Not amazing but wasn't awful by any stretch.  Beer list is great. Definitely the best I've seen in Calgary by far! Prices are typical Alberta expensive (spending most of my time in the States it's tough to come back to these prices, yikes).  Food was all pretty good. Again not amazing but definitely good.   We were a huge group (25 or so) and the service was quite good, especially for such a large group. We never waited long for anything and they came by often. They did bring us a few things we didn't order but those were solved quickly ($130 seafood platter.. nope that wasn't us!).  Patio is nice, but the view is awful as its in a mall complex area, situated directly beside a gas station.. But what do you expect for the location."}
{"text":"Dinner before a movie is pretty important - sitting through 2-3 hours when you're hungry makes for a poor moviegoing experience!  With that in mind we met up with a friend at the National right across from the theatres.  Dinner choice for the night was a platter of Fish & Chips for D and a Bacon Cheddar Burger for myself.  The fish looked delicious, well seasoned batter with a good crisp to the outside.  The burger was a little messy but you can tell they make the patties in-house and the taste was decent.  The fries were freshly cooked so they were super hot and came in little cups so that any oil or vinegar dripped to the bottom out of the way, keeping them crispy.  We all shared a plate of hotwings to start, they were very saucy and properly cooked with a nice heat and flavour balance.  Simple fare but delicious.  The only trouble was the place was so loud it was hard to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection.  We came for brunch and they have a great menu, the big breakfast had quality organic ingredients.  High chairs available for the kids and change table in washroom made it easy for a family friendly brunch.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The National. I had a decent lunch here, nothing super great. I don't really see what sets this place apart from the too-numerous-to-count other gastropub/big burger/lots of fries kinda places that are everywhere in Calgary. I had the brisket sandwich. The meat was good, lots of flavor, the bun a little too greasy, but fine. Everything else I saw people eating was some variation of deep fried, like at Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag. I guess the general vibe I got just struck me as overly meh. It's a big open space with little personality. Lots of beer, a good representation of local and more regional beer. I was there to meet friends. Good for that, as there is little else to distract you. The staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Waitress was an absolute gem but that was the end of the positive! Have went here multiple times in the past without being impressed and this time was no different. Thought we would give it a chance after about 6 month and still crap, unfortunately. Oysters were good, charcuterie board wasn't as good as other places and ordered the burger medium rare but it tasted very dry. Enjoy this place because of the selection of beer although pricey compared to others but this is something we knew going in. Certainly will not be going back unfortunately, maybe we'll give it another shot in 6 months!"}
{"text":"It is rare to find good service lately. Waitresses continually appear as though it is inconvenient to be serving you. The service and personality you experience from the girls at National is so appreciated. On one occasion I had ordered popcorn which was taking a oddly long time to arrive at our table. We happily drank and enjoyed our other appetizers while waiting for the popcorn. The entire time our waitress continued to check on the hold up, apologize for the delay and ensure we were served in the meantime. When the popcorn finally came she brought 2 bowls as a gesture for the inconvenience of waiting. While it is a small gesture it was noticed and appreciated. The small things can certainly make a world of a difference. I also notice the manager is always around and involved in ensuring everything is running smoothly."}
{"text":"Really limited menu, hard chairs and communal benches. The waitress was very hurried, and working completely alone, so service was slow, although food was fairly good."}
{"text":"I wavered between two and three stars on this. Mostly because it could just be our tables issues, and what we ordered.  Headed there on a Tuesday for lunch. Not crowded, found a nice shady table outside. Waitress cane over straight away.  I had the fish tacos, which were good - but way over cooked. The battered fish was bordering on black. Got three small tacos for $9 (Tuesday special), but still would have like something with it. A few fries, chips, anything. Friend ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. She said it was really disappointing and not what she expected. Party of the 3 if us ordered a side of fries. Which ended up being $8! Wow!  Worse was the drinks. We each got a cocktail for $15. Served in plastic cups. Mine had a champagne base - so I especially was surprised to see mine in a big plastic jug. Its ok, but not super appetizing. Sadly, none of us liked our drinks...  Truthfully this whole review could be written off as - wow, these gurus are picky! But I should add that our waitress made comment on almost everything we ordered. Do you like a lot of lime flavor? Do you like pimento spread? It was prob a secret jab we should have picked up on. But if you have to be talked out if things on a menu, well - maybe it needs overhauling."}
{"text":"Salad lovers, rejoice! Today was a salad kinda day and I've got a renewed appreciation for National @ Westhills after ordering their \"National BLT\". It was slightly overdressed, but the combination of flavours and the sous vide eggs were"}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise for us. We sat on the patio on one of the few nice days food was good menu was good and server was great. We will definately return as the price was right and the service was pretty great. Cheers"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me. Beer selection, happy hour pricing and elevated pub food has me frequenting this place at least once a week. My favourite server is Saleste, she made my friend's celebration stellar with her service and accommodation.   I'm addicted to the super crunchy tater tots with Clive sauce. I like to pour a bit of the table hot sauce and then douse it in the Clive dip. The Clive burger was my go-to dish but now I found out about National's seafood chowder. Oh my goodness.. the amount of tender mussels, smoked cod and lobster is unreal. I tried a bite of the fried chicken, the batter tasted burnt."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles! With a massive selection of pale Ales and iPas need I say more? Great to go here then a movie!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely loving the new National location in Westhills!  I lived in the area for years, and am kind of sad that I moved to the SE just before this opened.  But I still come over regularly for drinks, and look forward to enjoying their patio this summer!    National in Westhills has more of a casual, family-style atmosphere than their 10th or 17th Ave locations.  Extensive beer list, and great food.  My absolute fave is the Pork Belly sliders.  I literally dream about them - to die for.  I would eat these every day if given the choice."}
{"text":"Great beer, awesome atmosphere for bar, good bar finger food. Will be back for sure.."}
{"text":"I like that National offers both the brunch and regular menu around lunchtime on the weekends. At 11am on a Saturday the restaurant/bar was about 1/4 full, mainly with families with kids.  Today I had the pork belly BLT with fries. The sandwich was satisfying with a soft brioche bun and pork belly that wasn't too fatty. The thin sliced jalapenos are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Wednesday early evening - had new waitress on first day of work and she was very friendly and had great attitude. Fish tacos pretty good, chicken and biscuits very good, and beer list impressive. Overall a good pre or post movie spot and would be a good place for groups."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this past Friday. The food and service was good. The fish and chips were excellent. Unfortunately the Caesar Drink was awful a big disappointment. Otherwise good experience"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, great variety and really cool atmosphere. Only complaint is that it claims to be kid friendly but doesn't have a kids menu. It was relaxed and the kids enjoyed it, but would have been nice to have smaller portions for them."}
{"text":"Lunch on Sunday, chicken wings and deep fried pickles. Both were hot and tasty.  We were only shown the brunch menu, but saw that people around us ordered items we did not see on that menu.  This seemed odd, shouldn't we all get the same choices? Our other issue are the tables.  I prefer not to sit at a picnic bench, it's not very comfortable.  But I can live with that as we knew that going in. my issue was that we were seated at a bench for 4, and there were only 2 of us. We were asked if we would mind having a couple with a baby sit at our bench. This was a lunch with my 77 yr old mother from out of town and we wanted to enjoy it together after doing some shopping in the area. A baby wasn't part of our plan. When we said yes we would mind, the hostess was clearly annoyed and our service deteriorated."}
{"text":"I have always had a decent experience in this place but never something to remember and go back for. We went there for brunch once and did NOT enjoy the food quality.  It's big and can always fit in bigger groups, and the servers are usually quite nice and helpful. go for drinks and snacks, but keep your expectations realistic! :)"}
{"text":"I've been to most of the locations by now, and this is by far the best. The service can be a little slow sometimes - even when it's pretty slow - but still pretty good. No complaints about the food. Brunch is great and the coffee is excellent."}
{"text":"First time at this location and came here for Sunday brunch.  It was not good.  The shredded hashbrowns were white....  Like barely touched the griddle white and maybe lukewarm if that.  Everything was bland and we needed to add salt. My egg sandwich was supposed to have avocado but it wasn't there.  The chiliquilles had bland ground beef in it (which wasn't listed on the menu), had BROWN guacamole,  and was liquidy in the dish. The steak and eggs come with toast but the toast was rock hard and you could hear it snap in half.  Spending $14-22 / dish we were very disappointed with the food quality.  The food was also very slow to come out of the kitchen.  Not recommended for the brunch."}
{"text":"I like this place. I usually choose to come on less busy times just because it can get really loud. There is a nice patio for sunny days, and long tables on the inside that are numbered. I like that layout and think it's pretty cool. Good for meeting new people on busier days.  I love that this place servers tater tots, I think that is hilarious. But also amazing because tater tots are delicious.   I also tried the hawaiian pizza and it was really good.   Something that I like about this place is that everyone can come. I saw a few children, and I also was able to come with my granny. She thought the place was nice and would definitely come again with her friends. I like that they don't discriminate. :)  Some of the other times that I've been here I have tried the breakfast menu. I like being able to get breakfast whenever I want too.  Our server was a cute blonde lady who was sweet and helpful. Glad this location came to Westhills, now I don't have to go far to have a simple night out."}
{"text":"Let's just get right to it. National is a great beer hall between 3-6 when pints of beer and cocktails are $5. After six, pints are $8.50. That's getting a little pricey for a suburb pub.   Food is good. Oysters for $1 on Tuesdays are fantastic.   I go back to National for their tap selection. Quality craft beers at a decent price, between 3 pm and 6 pm that is."}
{"text":"I would say, not bad at all for a chain.  Service is a bit on relaxed side, but when they do attend you, they do it genuinely and are helpful.  Food quality and quantity is about average - not too big or small, just probably right. Ingredients look more like canned stuff, but overall prepared professionally - so no real complains here. Not much of excitement, though.  I would recommend this place as a lunch-with-co-workers type of visit, or maybe occasional drive-by bar visit, but there isn't really much about National Westhills to dream about. Just an average good place - which is not bad at all!"}
{"text":"The crazy busyness of this location has slowed a bit, making this a lovely local hangout for great beers and good food.  Westhills location has much better service than some of their downtown counterparts, and I like the open layout.   Their weekday happy hour and food specials make it a great place to gather with friends in the area."}
