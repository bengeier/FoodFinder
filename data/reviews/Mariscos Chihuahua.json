{"text":"I'm on a search in the area for Fish tacos and came across this place via Yelp. I think I was here maybe 5+ years ago and if it is the place I'm thinking of, they had good cerviche. But on this trip I ordered 2 fish tacos and 1 shrimp taco (my M.O.) to see how they were prepared. There was a good freshness to the cabbage, tomato and avocado on the tacos. I liked that they gave me the crema sauce on the side instead of plopping it on there. The fish tacos were better than the shrimp in my opinion. Both were fried but the shrimp were on the small side. There was a nice saltiness to the batter to give the tacos extra flavor. Without even asking I got extra limes which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and the seafood cocktails were fantastic.  Great service too.  Prices were very reasonable   I'm glad my main squeeze brought me here.  I will be coming back.  I can't wait to try the ceviche."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything is cooked fresh. You will never have ceviche like this anywhere else. The squid is cooked so well. Unique dishes and amazing service. A hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and fantastic prices. I am definitely coming back here again. The camarones Culichi and albañil are amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican seafood joint: teeny and yummy. The fish is always fresh. My favorites are the Pescado Frito Entero (whole fried fish) and the Caldo 7 mares which like a Bouillabaisse. Have you ever noticed that the coke tastes terrible in 9 out of 10 soda fountains? I'm not sure why that is but that is not the case here. I would come to this place just for the proper coke fountain mix! By the way there is not much room in this little hut so plan accordingly. Somehow they are able to fit mariachis in here though. They must use a shoehorn when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great lemonade and the folks working here are very friendly and helpful. This place will become a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Just passing through Mesa; Typical hole in the wall restaurant, just like any other small trailer food that is convenient and on the side of the road definitely had a Mexico feel to it. I love Mexican food! We had the fish tacos the setting was all right, the service was all right, I was a little bit worried using the bathroom."}
{"text":"Just came home from this place and not feeling that great... I have been here numerous times, for some stupid reason I keep giving them a second, third, chance.  Today was the last time.

Ceviche is known for its shrimp, what I got today hardly had any shrimp whatsoever. 

The shrimp cocktail, if they can even call it that, was served in a small bowl, with boiled shrimp and what I could assume was ceviche juice. No detail, presentation, or taste. Some of my shrimp looked old.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"I have gone to other marisco places in phx but the taste from this kitchen is GREAT! My top picks are: molcajete especial, camarones culichi and toritos. It also is one of the few marisco joints where you can actually have a conversation with your date because the music is not blasting. The times I have gone I have had a good experience from the staff, definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My favorite plate is camarones culichi ! 
Everything i have had here is good, but culichis are my favorite! Only thing I dont like is that they dont have many tables and we kind of feel like we are obligated to get up as soon as we are done for others who are waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"The place was not much to look at driving by, or on walking in, but the food was excellent. Like high quality with fast food ambiance! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The seafood here is delicious!!  Its a bit of a drive for us since we live in Arrowhead Ranch area.  The shrimp ceviche tostadas, chihiahuita and the tostadas mixtas are what we usually come in for.  The place is tiny so we normally call an order in for pick up and since what we eat is normally cool food it's ok.  The portions are also good.  This is good Mexican seafood. Must try."}
{"text":"Very good tacos de marlin. The only thing that was missing was the chipotle sauce. Delicious fish tacos and Jamaica. Great service and place is very clean. I give it 4.5 and I would definitely eat here again when I'm back in AZ."}
{"text":"Ahh mann.. tiny but mighty! The freshest tastiest seafood ever.. I'm a big fan  Ceveiche and the shrimp (something in green sauce) are stellar..fast service and very cute little hut reminds me of those beachside places that are so good and unpretentious!"}
{"text":"went back again today, still awesome. They have special a few days a week and today just so happened to be \"It's Tuesday, a dozen oysters are only 99 cents\" day. Holy mother of pearl! So  I had the oysters, a small shrimp ceviche and the bomb.com crab tostada. All awesome. Oysters super fresh and shucked to perfection, not all torn up. I stopped by the QT on the way home and got a tall can of Chelada and BAM! I'm official! Get there!"}
{"text":"Aye Chihuahua!! This little joint has great seafood items where you don't peso much. Every afternoon this little crowded eatery's occupants nearly double as a 4 or 5 piece mariachi band comes in and entertains.
Table service with cold beers and plenty of appetizers.
My favorite dish is the pescado buccanero which is a sinfully delicious white fish fillet (probably fresh tillapia because they ran out one night. Frozen fish never runs out.) smothered in a savory red chili and cheese sauce... mucho gusto!
Oysters on the half shell are the gulf variety but very fresh and expertly shucked with no broken shell pieces to spoil your bite. I used to shuck oysters commercially and appreciate a good oyster shucker.
Don't let the dumpy exterior fool you, this place is clean, service great and you will come back for mas."}
{"text":"I tried to order two different things on the menu and they didn't have it. Not a good start. I ended up getting the shrimp tostada and shrimp cocktail. They were ok. I wish the cocktail had bigger chunks of the veggies, they were almost minced sized and the cocktail was a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"Great seafood! Great customer service! Very clean! Food is delicious!!! The tostadas have lots of ceviche they have plenty to drink everything is great!"}
{"text":"Some of the better Mariscos in the valley!  I've been to a lot of them and Chihuahua is excellent. Recently went back and had ceviche tostadas, marlin tacos, oysters, and micheladas. 

The ceviche was really good. Fresh, vibrant, flavorful. The marlin tacos were delicious. Melted cheese, marlin, a ton of toppings. Oysters were fresh and decent size. Micheladas were on point. Perfect amount of seasoning and mix. 

They also give you free chips and salsa and great service. Two of the things missing in most mariscos spots."}
{"text":"It's a small place but this little blue and white seafood eatery is easy to spot. Because of the space limitation, the dining area is a tad cramped. But the staff is friendly and the seafood is really, really fresh! I consider the prices to be moderate because, while not exactly inexpensive, they're pretty good considering the quality, flavor, and freshness of the seafood."}
{"text":"I always see this place and never thought of stepping foot inside until my boyfriend said to try it out at least. The waitress/hostess was polite and had great service. The food was delicious as well. I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"It's cool... not the greatest atmosphere or the greatest service but it is ok at best. Priced a little high for the quality,quantity and the overall experience."}
{"text":"This is the smallest Mexican seafood restaurant I've ever been to. It defiantly one of the best! I had their special shrimp cocktail which had a mix of everything from shrimp to scallops to oysters. My dad is from chihuahua so we decided to stop in and did not regret it!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican Shrimp Cocktail ever. Small place. However, no wait time here like the other Mexican seafood places in town and no live and loud music here. Come alone or come on a date. Not fancy but just plain good neighborhood place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat! Everything is delicious! Tonight I had ceviche tostadas they where great they give you a lot of shrimp more shrimp then anything which is exactly how I like it. We also had the famous micheladas  it's spicy it's great has all the right flavors but if your looking for a amazing spicy micheladas this place is where you want to go Lucas around the rim with a big old shrimp on the side so delicious!

Cleanliness- they always keep this place very very clean always wiping the tables and cleaning up your dishes out of the way as you finish them.

Staff - wonderful so find friendly helpful making sure our drinks are constantly being refilled and all our needs are met. 

This place is a definite go to for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Some of the best ceviche I have found in a long time, LOVE this place! Everything is fresh, fast, and it's going to be my new go to!"}
{"text":"Mariscos Chihuahua has always seemed to me like.a seafood Filiberto's. I always see them on the side of the road, generally in shadier areas, with that signature blue roof and a busy parking lot. Still, I'd never met anyone who had actually gone to Mariscos. 

Is there a Yelp Whitey Badge? If so, I just unlocked it.

Jenny and I were in the mood for fish tacos but had no patience for the kind to crap Rubios or these other Mexican places try to pass off as over-breaded, deep-fried, fish sticks in a tortilla. We wanted good good seafood and, damn it, if anyplace was going to be able to hit that mark, it was going to be a place named Mariscos.

We parked in the back and entered the small shop with a man at the counter and a couple eating in the corner. I think a man and woman were the only people working. She took our drink orders and discussed any questions we had on the menu.  We ended up with some shrimp tacos, fish tacos, and seafood cocktail dishes. All were excellent. I have to say, we are now Mariscos fans por siempre!"}
{"text":"i love this place! great shrimp tacos and cocteles! will deff. be coming back! i wish it was a little bigger but the food is great!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was little w my parents, now I come in w my fiancée! Same great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, not a lot of seating space, however, food makes up for everything.  Me and the wife had a couple of chihuahuita cocktails and they were GREAT!!  Also had a shrimp ceviche tostada and a mixta.  I prefered the shrimp ceviche by a longshot.  Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"the place was good the food was fresh and the service was friendly. It's always important for the food to be fresh when it come to sea food"}
{"text":"My favorite ceviche in Phoenix! The place is tiny and crowded but the food is always worth it ."}
{"text":"We love 
Mariscos chihuahua! The food is always super fresh and soooo delicious! Pulpo and camarrones cocktail is the bomb. TGE FRIGGIN BEST CRAB TOSTADAS!  Real crab,  not that fake crap. Delicious. Beer and mariscos, what more do you want?"}
{"text":"This place is so so so so so good! I want their ceviche every day for the rest of my life! Small, cute little place!"}
{"text":"Hungover and I ordered their cocktail with all the fishy stuff and avocado on the side! Medium size! My boyfriend picked it up and spent less then 13$ me and my best friend ate out of it. And they gave me a whole avocado. And it was so good the juice is so good !! Defff going back !!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite seafood dishes is Ceviche. So, being Mexican and having fresh ceviche on the beach made me extremely picky getting it elsewhere. However, Mariscos Chihuahua has the best Ceviche I have ever tasted. It is so fresh and so tasty. I totally did not expect this while stumbling upon this location. Our entire dental office (Cute Smiles 4 Kids) that is down the street go here regularly for lunch."}
{"text":"I usually avoid seafood at all cost. I can't stand it most of the time with a couple exceptions. This place was great. Super nice and really really fast. By the time we ordered, it took maybe 5 minutes for our food to come out. I even tried some oysters which I was super hesitant and scared to do but they were great. I got the shrimp tacos and they were the best I've ever had!! Definitely my new go-to for seafood"}
{"text":"Not the best food... If you are starving dont come waited almost an hour for my food everyone around us had their food delivered except us.. Took them 10 minutes to just get our drinks. Not coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and like it. Really good seafood tacos.

I always have a fish taco and shrimp taco with rice on the side. They're good sized, not little bite sized tacos. They use a single corn tortilla and shred the fish or shrimp into thin strips before frying. They do a great job cooking it, leaving the seafood with a thin crispy crunchy coating. So the taco has the seafood piled in with lettuce and a slice of fresh avocado. And then I add plenty of their homemade chipotle \"aioli\". The flan is good too. Better than I expected."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new, and this place was alright. The waiting time was so long, and I didn't find it to be the most sanitary place to eat just because the hands that prepared the food were the hands that opened and closed the door. No gloves whatsoever. I was served my food by the chef, who had creamy gunk all over his fingers. Nevertheless, I ate the taco since I was too hungry from waiting... And it was alright."}
{"text":"This probable ones of my favorites restaurant. Good service. Delicius plates. Love the koctail and if you order salsa, it's just amazing addictive and a lot spicy. Yummy. 
It's a food service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the ceviche from this place they have two locations in Phx that I know of, I have been to both and have never been disappointed. I will say this though, the seafood is rather pricy compared to other Mariscos restaurants and the juice in the shrimp cocktail hurts my nasal passages. It might be that I am allergic to something they put in they elixir or I don't really know what it is. Anyways the point is that it is not the traditional shrimp broth most other places use, and it keeps me from buying their shrimp cocktails, and that is a sad because I LOVE shrimp cocktails. Great Mariscos spot, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mariscos joints in the valley.  It's shady, it's small, it's delicious.  They sometimes have smoked marlin available (which I feel bad about, but holy mother of god is epic).  My favorite dishes here are the Campenchana Cocktail and their tostadas de ceviche.

One final non-food related but VERY IMPORTANT note here (and I will say this is also true to many of the other Mariscos joints in the valley- like Acupulco)... PAY WITH CASH if you don't want to deal with your CC info being stolen."}
{"text":"If you like shrimp, you must try the Camarones Culichi. This was THEE BEST shrimp dish I've ever eaten. No lie. It was amazing.  My boyfriend ordered the ceviche which was also amazing, but he wished he had ordered the shrimp. I would be a regular at this place if I lived closer."}
{"text":"To my utter surprise, this place is fantastic. I'll be honest in the fact that these holes in the wall scare me a bit since I have no idea what to expect. I have driven by this seafood spot for a couple of years and always laughed at the name. Last night, I was in the mood for Mexican and the hubby in the mood for seafood and something healthy. I really wanted chips and guacamole, which by the looks of the menu, they do not sell. No matter as I am always a sucker for some ceviche. There were seafood dishes galore and prices ranging from inexpensive (my small shrimp ceviche $5) to mixed seafood dishes for $18. Some of the more expensive dishes are offered as a daily special which can save you a few bucks on certain days. 

Our food came with tostada shells and per my request, avocado on the side ($2). It was a small whole avocado cut in half so very fresh. My ceviche was awesome, especially with the avocado. My husband had a crabmeat tostada and I was amazed at the amount of crabmeat piled on the top. My husband felt there was a 1/4 pound of crab meat on that thing. The food felt and tasted very fresh, too. 

Again, this spot was great. I tried to drop subtle hints to go back tonight but the husband wasn't having it. Maybe I'll try again tomorrow or the next day, or the next day....."}
{"text":"Thinniest piece of fish I've ever had; But it was good and the rice was good. I doubt I go back."}
{"text":"Great Crab tostadas!
The camarones culichi were right on, cannot go wrong with tomatilla sauce, shrimp stringy cheese!"}
