{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight...yummy greek food prepared fresh. I don't know if it's because of the time that I got there but he was grilling pork and chicken skewers fresh. The rice and potatoes,however must have been on the steam table. Rice was a little mushy for me,potatoes had bite. Wife thought rice was yummy,hence the four stars...I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch while running errands in town. Good value, fresh food and tasted great. Would recommend if looking for a quick Greek lunch."}
{"text":"Great Greek food coming from. Sri Lanka guys who cook them, meat is perfect !"}
{"text":"This place is easily missed . The plaza on the south side of wellington in with Home Hardware.
Once you find it you will continue to go back. The food takes time to come out as they cook everything fresh as you wait. Calling ahead is a good idea. They have great salads and lots of variety mainly greek food but burgers are available. We have eaten here several times and yet to be disappointed. Great food at a very reasonable price . 
The place is tiny so groups of two or four if you want to stay. 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Lunch special was small portions. Average taste, prepared by non-Greeks (Sri Lankin). 
Small seating capacity. No waiters. 
Prefer Mr. Greek express at Walmart plaza near 404 in Aurora."}
{"text":"Best food for the price in Aurora. Only place you can fead a family of 4-5 for under $30. Puts Mr. And Friendly greek to shame."}
{"text":"Called in for a takeout order and the man didn't even identify the restaurant when he answered the phone. Placed my order and he hung up without letting me know when it would be ready. Went and picked it up 20 minutes later and he got the order wrong. Chicken wasn't cooked and there was no salad dressing. Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had in a long time. Tzatzki was to die for!! Had the calamari and it was fried to golden brown perfect. Came with rice and salad and potatoes for $12."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't try this place sooner considering this place is so close in my neighborhood. Anyway let's get to it. The prices are really great and value for your money. They have a family value meal (i can't remember the price but I recall thinking what a good price for 4-5 people ).  I ordered 2 pork souvlaki meals which comess with rice & potatoes, pita bread & salad; $8.95 each. (Pork meal comes with 2 sticks). It was delicious, tender pork cooked well and the rice,potatoes,salad really tasty. Bang bang for my bucks!  The only draw back to the place is its a tad old or run down already; but I only do take out here. It's a great spot for the local high school kids(great value & filling food at lunch). 
They do also have non \"greek\" items like Philly cheesesteaks poutine and a few other things I can't recall at the moment. 
This is a great takeout option place with limited tables (4 only). Just to reiterate, it's great value & tasty."}
{"text":"Place used to be good.. or so I thought. Reasonable prices for what you get.. obviously not authentic. The worst part is the extremely rude employees. How unfortunate that they don't care about losing repeat customers."}
{"text":"Food was good. Not amazing...but good.
Souvlaki dinner was a nice large portion especially for the price.
Chicken was flavourful and juicy.
Salad was good.
Pita was disappointing.
Potatoes were good but not traditional greek potatoes given that they pour tomato sauce overtop of them.

Place needs a nice cleaning and a coat of paint or two. I'm all in for a dive with good food...but if the front of the house can't keep their tables and floor clean, how clean do you think the kitchen is that they're preparing the food in?
Providing a knife or perhaps even metal cutlery would be nice too for those who eat in."}
{"text":"This is not really a Greek restaurant, its an Indian guy serving fast food, he does a good job and the prices are good. The fries are actually very good ."}
{"text":"Just walked in and I was inquiring about the student special on the wall. Owner rudely replied to me that it's only for students I showed him my college student card and he said it's only for students beside the resturant all smirky.

I've been here before and the prices are good but the place is dirty and to be honest the person behind the counter looks dirty (clothes/hat look dirty and he handles money and food)

Won't be back here again. There's other Greek options that are better around the area. Spend your money elsewhere."}
