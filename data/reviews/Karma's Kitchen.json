{"text":"First impression: very hot and a flurry of flies by the door

My boyfriend had been wanting to try this place for a while and we finally tried it last night. We ordered a few things and half the stuff we got was great and the other half was just soso (bland or strange unidentifiable flavours). That's the overall feel I get from their menu also. One thing I do like is that everything came out piping hot! 

Food does take a loooooong time, as other yelpers mentioned, and it comes one dish at a time so this is not a place for when you're in a rush. We were the only people in the restaurant most of the time but I think they prioritize take out/foodora orders. 

Near the end of our meal, a man and woman came in (total of 4 people inside the restaurant, important for later) and we think they were friends of the owner since the woman was going into the kitchen and chatting and the owner came out to chat with them as well. 

I noticed they got the same momo we ordered but we hadn't gotten ours yet and we definitely ordered before them. My boyfriend went to ask and lo and behold, the server said she had given it to the other table. 

She apologized profusely and wasn't rude at all but said she \"got distracted by the crowd\" and \"it's a good thing you came to ask about it.\" I mean.... okay? I guess four is a crowd? If we didn't ask about it would we just have just sat there forever? 

When we finally got our jhol momo, it was lukewarm and felt like a sloppy microwave job :( maybe they rushed it since they mixed up the order but it was such a disappointing end to what would've been a fairly decent meal. 

Will I come back? Maybe, but probably only for take out."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place in the heart of Gerrard India Bazaar. The food is amazing and the service is excellent as well. My favorite has to be the Tibetan Sizzler Momo's plate. The Currys and the Nepali thalis are also very tasty! Highly recommend and I will be returning very soon."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try something different and gave this place a try. We were not disappointed! The Tibetan Momo's were delicious. We also ordered the Thali and a couple of noodle dishes that were very tasty. We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Great healthy and tasty food. Steam Mo mo is fantastic. Clean and quiet environment. Great and polite service."}
{"text":"Came here last night ~ loved the atmosphere and the staff were friendly and attentive. We ordered 4 dishes ~ all were delicious! For those who don't like spicy ~ let them know when you order... a number of the dishes are spicy ~ for me it was just perfect. The potions are a little small ~ especially the meat ones ~ but the taste made up for it ~ I'll definitely be back! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great place. The food is very tasty, price is good, comfy atmosphere. My food was a bit spicy, and they were refilling my water all the time. The chief brought me masala chai, said it would help with the spiciness."}
{"text":"BEST NEPALESE/TIBETAN CUISINE IN TOWN! The Momos are simply divine..haven't had anything like it before! Not even in Nepal (both born and raised). The beef Jhol Momo, beef steamed momo and beef C Momo and Khasiko sukuti are a MUST EAT...The Thukpa Ghanthuk is amazing if you're looking for some REAL authentic TIBETAN broth/soup. Finally the Tibetan Tea with salted butter is the best way to top it all off as a grand final√©. Absolutely authentic and divine!! We also met the owner Karma, who is very welcoming and suggested us to try the \"DaalBhat\" next time. There shall always be a next time with THIS place!!"}
{"text":"We had a party for 7 people and all of us enjoyed the food. Started with hot and sour soup which was spicy and delicious and then came potato chilli which is spicy style french fries. Loved it! The highlight was the momo which is as I understand is a traditional Tibetan dumpling dish. We ordered both chicken and veggie style momos and I particulary liked the chicken ones. Chilli chicken was sizzling and medium spicy...the way I like it. Forgot the name of their traditional bread but I found it tasty and unique at the same time.
I'll visit again soon."}
{"text":"First off i got not one but TWO hairs in my meal!    Soooo grosss.   Drove pretty far to have dinner here. What a let down. this is the 5th Nepalese restaurant i have been to in the GTA, so yes i know what it is suppose to taste like.   We had various momos, ALL of them were barely cooked, so chewy, still raw.     There was no spice, no flavour nothing!   The manchurian momos were passable i guess. Go to One of the Nepalese places in Parkdale for a more authentic experience."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese Indian food. Lovely man that serves. Ambiance is quiet and a bit dim. Worth a try but if you are looking for an Indian spot on the Gerard strip there are many options. This definitely has more of a Chinese food flavour."}
{"text":"The chicken dumplings are amazing! Lovely food and very nice staff. First time there. Got the dumplings as take out. The sauces that came with the dumplings were also excellent - one hot chilli sauce and one sweet chilli sauce."}
{"text":"Went in to do their takeout buffet option, which is cheaper than their dine-in option. The only item at the buffet that interested me was the chicken wing so I filled my takeout container with a FEW wings (as there weren't many to begin with). When I got to the cash I got charged way more than the buffet price. I asked why and was informed that they were charging me for what they charge for wings. There was no rule at the buffet informing patrons that to get the takeout buffet price that they have take more than one item. I have never been to a buffet before that stipulates to patrons how to eat. Also I went all the way there and served myself with wings sitting at the buffet for goodness knows how long, ie not made to order. I said I'd go back to the buffet and put something else in my container but was told the charge wasn't going to change cause I took too much in their opinion. My takeout container wasn't overflowing and closed completely. I was shocked and disgusted. I left the container at the cash and bounced. I'm pretty sure the restaurant dumped their precious wings back into the buffet, which would be so wrong! Never going back!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had such authentic momos in Toronto. Their \"C Momos\" were really delicious! Kuat go for someone who is looking for authentic Nepali cuisines."}
{"text":"My first time having this type of cuisine. WOW! So fresh and lots of veggies. I can't wait to have it again."}
{"text":"We visited Karma's kitchen for dinner. We ordered many dishes and here's my take on the food that we had. We were 4 people with 2 groupons.

Veg Momo steamed - were pretty good. There were 8 pieces in a portion and were the best item on the menu. Best we had in Toronto, we'll definitely be back for these.

Chilli Potato - was good too. Decent amount of chilli and flavour. Pretty balanced.

Veggie Chef's own fried rice - were horrible. They had a very overpowering garlic flavour and was tasteless. We had had 2-3 spoons and left the entire portion untouched.

Veg Chowmein - was okay. The vegetables were crisp but the chowmein lacked flavour though.

House Special Crispy Chicken - seemed stale. There was stench to it. Left most of it.

Cauliflower Manchurian - was okay too. It was different that we expected. The gravy was tasteless/flavourless. 

Mango Juice / Mango Lassi - were okay.

We might go there again to crave our momo cravings. Otherwise it was pretty unimpressive. The service was attentive."}
{"text":"The mediocre Indian style buffet is typical of something you would see in a small town where they are the only game in town so you suck it up, and enjoy the ride.
So why the four star rating? Just because I have hopes and Yay! I'm a fan of Indian buffets in general. The price was right and similar to the typical family type restaurant in Little India. But here we are on College St. near where I live. Way out of context and right up my alley (metaphorically and literally).
I was happy with that meal, in spite of the mediocrity with the typical tandoori chicken and naan. Fresh food was being brought out and topped up regularly and with the limited amount of items, maybe 8 or 10, plus ice cream, the setup seemed fairly balanced. Off to the side there were three different sauces, and each one was tasty and make me want more. The naan was excellent! Three of us went on the opening weekend for the special and I think we got the daytime/lunch price even though it was after 5 pm. Our bill? $15 for all three of us, wow!
The next time we went back with the intentions of having more of the extensive menu items including the momos. I've had momo's at two other places so far and I was expecting similar.
But Karma's weren't as good, at least the few I tried before they were gobbled up.
Since there was a vegan with us, the interesting options, marked with a V on the menu were welcomed and ended up being quite amazing.
It was a Sunday evening so the Tuesday/Sunday specials were in effect and we had a couple drinks, a beer and a cocktail. My caesar was good as I don't like them spicy and it was in a pint glass so nice as a mild drink with the spicer food.
Check out my pictures for what we ordered. The hot and sour soup was vegan and quite good. Hearty and rich. The sizzling beef and onions was tasty but the beef was somewhat tough. The chicken momo's were bathed in a tomato sauce which was quite different and not what I'm used to. I found the chicken momo's to be a bit on the thin side and more chewy than I like. That meal was $75 and I paid a tip on top of that.
I will be back but I think the buffet is a better deal and quite good. But the specials! Oh my! On the board it had AYCE wings plus lollipop including a beer for $13.99. Also drink specials that I haven't seen anywhere. What a throwback to see domestic beer $3.25 and imported $3.50. Wow! Also, I saw a sign on College St. a block away proclaiming a Karma lounge with drink specials. I bet that will be upstairs which was just a dark staircase but got me wondering. And it's all because I have high hopes. Please, let this thrive!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great and not cheap for small portion size meal which I shelled out more than twenty dollars for two small dishes.  Give this place a try (momos, the sizzling plate, the rice or chowmein, and curry dishes) as it is new and interesting that offers something different in east Gerrard India Bazaar so worth one little adventure."}
{"text":"Great little Nepalese spot! Super friendly service and absolutely delicious food. I highly recommend the noodle soups and momos!"}
{"text":"4 stars for this place? You gotta be kidding me!

The food was below average to be honest. Nothing special and everything tasted bland. The service was really slow and there was six of us in the restaurant. The food came after maybe an hour and I don't understand why it would take that long for our food to come, especially if we were the only people being served. Not only that but each dish came separately and you have to wait again for maybe another 10 minutes for the next dish to come. The portions were really small and the food was just bland, even adding soy sauce couldn't save the dish. Honestly, even fast food Asian restaurants taste better than the dishes they serve here.

I wouldn't recommend coming to this place, go somewhere else and don't waste your money here.

The only good thing about this place was the server being nice but that's about it."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Tibetan/Nepalese food. I thought it would be similar to Hakka food because it's a fusion of Chinese and Indian but unlike Hakka food this one is mild in taste where the flavour of the food is not overpowered by the spice. We ordered three dishes: steamed veggie momo, Nepali chicken thali, and paneer manchurian. Veggie momo tasted like Indian dumplings. The thali included plain white rice, a leafy vegetable, potatoes, chicken curry, bamboo soup, mung bean soup, and pickled daikon. I liked the variety. The chicken curry was watery and light in flavour. The bamboo soup has a pungent smell characteristic of preserved bamboo. This dish is great for people who like to sample a little bit of everything. The paneer manchurian tasted like milky tofu with Chinese gravy. The texture of paneer is firm and it usually takes on the flavour of the dish but this one did not. My taste buds were confused because I'm used to having paneer with curry spice. The server made sure our water glasses were full. The food was unique and delicious. We finished all of it without feeling bloated or thirsty by the end. The servers were attentive and friendly. I would recommend this place to people who are looking to try something unique and comforting."}
{"text":"Unique cuisine and excellent value for the money.  Would highly recommend for anybody looking for something different from all the generic Thai places out there -"}
{"text":"Lunch for two on a Saturday.
Place was not very busy, though we came around 1:45 and a few tables were cleaning up.

There are some seats near the window where you can kneel if you're looking for that kind of experience. Otherwise you'll get normal tables. 

Each seat comes with fork and knife, but they can offer chopsticks with a cute design. 

There's a lot of cultural decoration to look at while you wait, and you may be in for quite a wait.

They have lunch specials that you can take advantage of. Note that they have specials listed outside near the front on a sign, as well as a separate list of specials on a piece of paper inside.

I ordered a plate of shabhaley and a plate of chili momo. They tasted great, though the chili turned out to be ketchup or tomato sauce, rather than simply spicy momo. Can get pricey, $8.99 for three shabhaleys and $8.99 for the chili momo. I would recommend just getting the steamed or fried momo instead.

One thing that really stood out was a jar of orange hot sauce they provide. I would put that in any meal if I could. The owner says it's very spicy but don't be afraid to try it since it tastes amazing.

Another thing that stood out was the fact that the
washrooms were well maintained."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS! 

I think this might be my new favorite restaurant in the entire city. Definitely in my top 3. 

Here are my three favorite dishes on the menu:

- Tofu Manchurian Sizzler
- Momo Manchurian Sizzler (momos are dumplings)
- Baingan Bharta (creamy mashed eggplant with spices -- I normally don't like eggplant but this is AMAZING)

Go eat here as soon as you can. If not, you'll be missing out!!!"}
{"text":"Good place. The momos weren't great by momo standards but they were still pretty good, because momos are momos. 
The other food was great. We had chili chicken, broccoli and mushroom, crispy beef. All of it was great and came quite quick. I used to live in Nepal and they had the prayer flags and Tibetan buddhist music playing which made me very nostalgic. It is a good place, I expect to be a regular when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great fusion of Nepalese / Tibetaan / indian dishs. some are pure Indian, pure Tibetaan or pure indian and some are fusions of two or three of this dishes.

a few tables are sit on floor pillows the rest are regular chairs.

will be licensed in a few weeks, great house Chai tea $1.00

very affordable, buttet $7.99 per plate, big eaters can buy two plates, they have take-out, buffet and al-carte menus

pleasent Himalayan music playing"}
{"text":"Surprised by the reviews on here - I had a very positive experience with a group of friends at Karma's Kitchen. 

1) The hot sauce with the momo's is excellent - I would by this by the bottle if they sold it!
2) Very friendly chef, who was very kind and welcoming and took the time to answer the many question one of my dinner mates had!
3) The vegetarian thali is delicious - packed full of flavour!

This place is a no-frills type of joint - yes, the service isn't the fastest - however, it is excellent value and for lack of a better words, has a lot of 'heart'."}
{"text":"A bite from our experience review - 
\"We took a side of much needed rice to relieve our senses, throughout, and our waitress kept the water and napkins coming.
We should note that although our feet got cold by the large single exterior facing window, we were sweating from the hot food.\"

Read more via my profile link!"}
{"text":"Well I went opening week cause usually new places are giving their best!  I was there for the lunch buffet. 25% the opening week. There was a poster outside. (I should had read it first but excitement and hunger overcame me lol) Not much veg selection. 
I was hoping to find Tibetan food and But the buffet was more Indian/Nepalese than Tibetan. They have monos but if they are anything like their buffet, I'd rather go to parkdale! 
Veggie options were samosa, spring rolls, dhal, mix veggie, some sad looking noodles. So I suppose it's ok but it was m'eh. No hot sauce or any chutneys around to liven it up.
There was a few chicken items and beef & broccoli 
I didn't think the quality was there. 
I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best momos in the city - delicious! Had the chicken thali also which was very good. While we were eating, the owner and the chef hand made fresh momos. Will be back to try something different."}
{"text":"Best Indian butter chicken masala, n Tibetan Momo n samosa taste so delicious. We went there in big group for celebrations n they have big space with good service.. good for gathering ohh sizzler is also unique dishes over there that looks royal food"}
{"text":"You know what makes Karma 5 stars, Karma himself. That's the owner. He is open and sweet. He wants you to enjoy the food of his country and talks about his food with enthusiasm and joy. Karma is very proud of his homemade chilli sauce, so if you like spicy, do ask for it.

Now the food: we've been there three times and have always enjoyed our meals. I would say it is more so the delicious, clean home cooking, rather than amazing restaurant fare. It isn't greasy, msg laden, flavoured packed food. It is food you eat when you're tired of eating out. I've eaten here when I was too sick to cook. I ordered the steamed Momo, vegetarian noodle soup and some lentil/mung bean stew. All delicious."}
{"text":"Confused if I should be giving 2 or 3 stars to this restaurant. I feel so crappie when I see some people open a restaurant at an amazing location, spacious area but extremely untrained and unskilled staff. The menu looks quite promising and tons of options but the staff barely speak English making it harder to understand for the first timers and newbies trying out this cuisine. They served us completely wrong order after waiting for almost more than 30 minutes, the restaurant had no more than 2 tables occupied. Their service is SUPER SLOW. Size of Momo is too small and takes forever to make them. Hot sauce was not too bad. Paneer Sizzler comes with some boiled veggie, paneer and plain noodles. The dish look good but nothing great. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am going to throw out a disclaimer-- I have never had Nepalese or Himalayan food so take it for what it's worth.

Every time we drove by we always wanted to make a stop at this place but it so happens we are always on route to some other destination. On this night, we weren't going to drive by anymore.

This place was empty except for 2 other guests. As we walked in, we were presented with a strange aroma of some sort. After several minutes I was finally able to decipher the smell and it's one of cooked bamboo. I remember growing up when mom used to put bamboo in our soups sometimes and the whole house had this strange, repulsive smell. It took a bit of time to adjust but after while, we were somewhat immune to it.

I had some vegetable thali platter of a few veggies and some rice and my partner had of all things a butter chicken (I think she was a little weary and wanted to play it safe). My platter consisted of some potatoes which was very bland. There was also some pungent smelling bamboo shoots that again lacked flavour but most disappointingly lack texture. I believe there was some pickled daikon as well. Lastly, the mung bean soup was pretty much un-drinkable-- very strange in flavour and lukewarm. Unfortunately, it was the lowly butter chicken the stole the show that night and it was a poorly executed one as well. While the sauce is adequate(a little sweeter than usual), the chicken had texture that somewhat resembled cardboard.

I think we should of taken a chance on the dumplings as it was the only outstanding items folks have noted but I am not sure if we will be back again. Someday I will try Nepalese/Himalayan food again at another place but hopefully this is not how its meant to be prepared."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. The place itself brought me peace of mind and combined with a very good quality meal and service I can't help not to leave my best evaluation. I will be coming back and I recommend you to try it."}
{"text":"The owner here, as well as any other staff I've encountered, really are lovely people.  

It's a very calm environment, if a bit slow at times, and the tables by the window feature the chance to sit on the floor on pillows, a nicely authentic experience.  

The food is good to very good, and highly affordable.  And they have a wealth of vegetarian and vegan options.

A welcome addition to the hood!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Nepali restaurant in Toronto so far. It's clean, unpretentious, and most of all the food is great."}
{"text":"Got a coupon for this restaurant, so decided to give it a try.  Unfortunately, the coupon was only valid for their buffets, but the food was great!  It's a spacious venue, good for events and quiet meals.  The portion and prices were great, and the staff were very friendly.  Would certainly recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered two types of momos, chai and a banana lassi. Everything was incredibly tasty, the owner was very friendly. If we lived in Toronto, we'd definitely stop by on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good experience dining here for lunch on a weekend.  We haven't tried Nepali/Tibetan food and decided to give it a shot.  My friend and I decided to try their lunch special.  

I chose the Nepali Thai mutton curry for $6.99.  The mutton curry and it was delicious, very flavourful.  I liked the combination of it such that it came with rice, lentil soup, dry potatoes and veg curry with homemade radish pickles.  All the above items tasted great. 

I was debating on which momo to order.  The server recommend the non-veggie option. The shell of the momo was a bit thick for my liking.  Overall, I enjoyed my mea"}
{"text":"Ordered again and still delicious! We got the same things as before as well as the tofu manchurian sizzler platter and the Tsey Nezhom (curry vegetables. Super good!"}
{"text":"This meal was so disappointing - sadly.  Our chicken curry dish had one piece (bone in section of a drum stick) of chicken in it (I swear).  The dumplings were in a spicy sauce (soaked in the sauce) and was more like a soup.  The noodles were the worst - plain noodles with salad on the side and some veg - we had ordered with egg and it was not added.  The beef dish was inedible - it was so tough.  We frequent thai, asian, koreen, Vietnamese restaurants - so our expectations were not too high - but wow was it disappointing."}
{"text":"I went to Karma's Kitchen yesterday for the 2nd time in two weeks. Before I wrote my review, I wanted to be sure that my wonderful experience with the delicious food on my 1st. time visit with my family; was exactly the same the 2nd time around. Yes, the few new items I tried this time was just as good. I had the father recommend their specialty items on my first visit; then his son Karma recommended the items I tried today. The Momos, Chilli Chicken, Chicken Noodle Soup were all very tasty. If you are into Indian Masala Chai (Tea), you should definitely try theirs, it's excellent! I will be returning to try more & be telling all my \"foodie\" friends about this family operated restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Definitely recommend the steamed momos and the chef's special fried rice. We had the Thai soup, Hot and Sour soup (both are tasty if you like spicy food), chicken momos, beef momos (yum yum!), chef's special friend rice with chicken (really enjoyed this) and chicken chilli (we liked this better than the chicken tangra, and they can adjust to your preferred level of spiciness)."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of momos all over the world and these are some of the best I have had - just love them! Had the steamed chicken and fried beef. Both so yummy! We regularly do takeout from here. Quick and friendly service. A great addition to the Little India Bazaar."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and tasty spicy and every dish tasted different. The only complaint I have is that some of the dishes with meat have very miserly portions which were mainly bones. The sauces were flavourful and the food was great.  The mutton sukuti why is my favorite dish but be warned it is spicy"}
{"text":"Ordered through Just Eat. Delivery was earlier than promised. Fried rice, chili chicken, thupka were excellent and not heavy handed with the grease which is rare. The momo filling was good but I wish there was a little less shell thickness. Will definitely order again"}
{"text":"Try the Momo's - they're the best!!!  Also, the Thai soup is awesome.  Freshly made quality food.  Great value for money!"}
{"text":"$5.99 (veg) - $6.99 (meat) Nepali Lunch specials on a Saturday! Now I haven't tried Nepali food before so this resto definitely stood out from the others in Little India. Their sign claims that their momos are better than regular dumplings. Now I eat dumplings quite often so that's a big claim. So I had to testify whether this is true. 

Ordered both lunch specials
Thali ($6.99) with mutton curry (option of veg or chicken) - Round platter with a variety of small dishes/soups that tickle your various taste buds - sweet, sour, savoury, bitter. I like it a lot and the curry has a rich unique flavour profile. I would definitely consider coming back for this again!

Momo's ($6.99) with chicken (option with veg) - Dumplings filled with chicken and some chives or green onions. This was just okay but the filling wasn't particularly unique and the dumpling wrapper was a little thicker than what I prefer. I still think nothing beats Chinese soup-filled dumplings (Xiao long bao). 

Overall enjoyed the experience! There weren't any customers when we stepped in at 1pm~ and usually I tend to avoid stepping in an empty restaurant but the sitting area by the window felt private enough that gave us space from the server in overhearing our every convo. The servers were also very friendly and gave us the perfect amount of attention. The lunch specials are totally worth it, go for the thali!"}
{"text":"If Maha's is too busy around the corner (or any other restaurants), come to Karma's Kitchen. It's a friendly restaurant with quite the menu. Sadly, the only stand out we're the dumplings. Skip the bamboo curry."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Slightly disappointed that some items from their Gerrard location were not on the menu.  The momos and mulligatawny soup were amazing - best I have ever had!"}
