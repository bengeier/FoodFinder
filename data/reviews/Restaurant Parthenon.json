{"text":"Went there like 10 times during my business trip in Montreal. Great brunch/breakfast during the week-end but their espresso is the worst in Nuns Island.   Waiters are very nice and well organized. Clean tables and comfortable seating. On the other hand, the restrooms are located outside the restaurant and shared with the mall clients (and they look like hospital restrooms)."}
{"text":"Parthenon is GREAT if you know what to order. It's been my go-to brunch place on IDS since I've lived here for 20 years! One customer posted that the manager was not too warm with customers and that's true! Some of the staff though (there's one gentleman in particular who's been there forever) is super-pleasant and very accommodating. The brunches (especially the omelettes) are delicious and the portions very generous. For lunch, I HIGHLY recommend the veggie sub. It's HUGE and comes with a ton of fries and it's really yummy. It's a very share-able dish as well. Their lox platter comes with a (real) bagel (none of those Tim Horton's wannabe cakey things), cream cheese and butter on the side and a salad with your choice of dressing. Great stick-to-your-ribs fare any time of day!"}
{"text":"It was the only thing open around 9:40 PM. I ordered the Surf and Turf and it was just ok, not super flavorful, but since I was really hungry and out of choices it got the job accomplished."}
{"text":"Parthenon is a letdown.   It really wasn't all that good. I ordered a burger deluxe which sounds nice, but it turns out it's actually just a 14$ cheeseburger with fries, which is listed on their delivery menu for 7$. Our food was delayed, which I can forgive, but came the dishes that came to the table were sub-par. The patty of my burger was burnt.  I wanted to be reasonable and so after discussing with my boyfriend, and after he sampled my burger, we decided to bring the issue to the attention of our waitress. We hoped the situation could be resolved so we could move on with our meal. Her response was to rudely tell us that they cook their burgers on charcoal. Cooking on charcoal, she continued, implied that their burgers could only be cooked \"well done\". My boyfriend and I are of the opinion that what they call well done is actually burned meat.   We didn't raise any issue about it; we all know what it's like to deal with annoying customers, so we let it slide and apologized for bothering her. Nevertheless, our waitress kept being rude for the rest of our visit. Even with this episode aside we felt very unwelcomed, which is never a good thing for a restaurant. Lastly, my boyfriend, who got the breakfast combo #1, found his food passable, but nothing memorable.  We are both of the strong opinion that a lack of competition in this price segment in Nuns Island allows the Parthenon to slack off. The menu selection is very simple, dare I say unexciting. Though the food is reasonably priced compared to the other restaurants on the island, spending the extra dollars will do you much better somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our destination for brunch when we stop on Nuns Island, Montreal. Nothing special about the food but reliable. The patio is quite nice on a summer's evening."}
{"text":"I am a big fan - their delivery service is SOOOOO quick! As well, the place is extremely child friendly. The food is decent and decently priced!  Their service is great and they recently renovated and it looks much better now."}
{"text":"Average food and very attentive wait staff. The location and parking made this restaurant very easy to get to. Plenty of TV's so you didn't miss any of the games on."}
{"text":"Check the photos, the smallest and driest chicken wings I had in my life! I was wondering where you got that!"}
{"text":"What doesn't kill you make you stronger?  Seriously the place is decent, no real speciality but they get the job done. Perfect for lunches.  The pizza is popular.  the place to be on fridays for a lot of workers on the island."}
