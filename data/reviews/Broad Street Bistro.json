{"text":"The wings are awesome, had the garlic Parmesan.  My wife had the Italian hoagie and it was huge.  Prices are very fair.     Came back after the remodel and menu redo and it is fabulous.  Great new menu selections, cannot wait to try all the items.  It was Lent and we had the fish sandwiches - one of the best I have had.  Strongly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I was here when this was the hurricane. The food was really good but i hated the smoke smell. We wanted to come after they changed to non smoking but unfortunately it still smells like smoke. Enjoyed the food both times. Wings are excellent. Service is good. We will definitely be back, just wish they would air the place out!!"}
{"text":"It took a while to get our food since we went on Mother's Day but the food was good.   Nice and comfortable place"}
{"text":"We find ourselves in North Versailles pretty regularly and decided to do a quick google search  to see if we were missing any hidden gem restaurants.  N. Versailles isn't a hotspot for eating, so we weren't expecting to find much. So we googled and BAM... Broad Street Bistro pops up. Apparently it was just on a tv show on Food Network and has gotten a re-model so we went to check it out!   The inside of this little bar/bistro looks great! Very modern and chic without seeming too pretentious for the area that it's in. We went around noon on a Saturday and there were a handful of other parties enjoying lunch. Our waitress was really friendly and stayed on top of our coffee re-fills, much appreciated on this cold, drizzly day.  The only drawback for us, was that there weren't many vegetarian options :-( This is nothing new in Pittsburgh,  but it's always disappointing to have choice your meal from the appetizer section. We ended choosing fried pickles and and white flatbread (spinach, tomato and feta). Fried pickles came as spears and were awesome. Had a nice cajun aioli drizzle. The flatbread was the winner, and it came with a nice balsamic drizzle. The flatbread wasn't too greasy, or too dry... was just really delicious.   We'll definitely be hitting this place up again. I'd give it 5 stars if there were some vegetarian selections :-)"}
{"text":"Not pleased at all.  Menu is outdated online and they don't customize your order if u ask for something left off.   No plastic wear for take out"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible..... took over an hour for sandwiches.... one sandwich came Out raw, came out at different times, absolutely horrible"}
{"text":"Great food with a  menu that varies from time to time.  Friendly staff and owner. Best wings in North Versailles."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for good places to eat in north Versailles and the old menu at broad street never made us ever want to eat there.  After the tv show the change was tremendous.  The staff was great, Very attentive and personable.  I had the meatloaf and my wife the roasted beet salad.  Mine was extremely good.  My wife liked hers but the chicken was a little dry and she wanted more of a grilled taste to the beets and less of a pickled taste.   Overall a great place to eat and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is probably closer to a 2.5 but I just cannot go three.  WE were shopping in the area and this is one of the only decently rated non-chain restaurant suggested per the yelp app.  When we arrived, we were not greeted so we sat ourselves in a booth along the wall.  This place is definitely more bar than restaurant, as the big bar in the one room is where most of the patrons were.  When we sat down there was only one other table of approximately six younger people in the dining area.   We were reviewing the beer menu when the very friendly server came over.  She said the beer lists were wrong, so she began to list off some of their offerings.  If you are a Budweiser, Coors, or Miller person, this place is for you.  The lack of options was disappointing, but she informed me they had Southern Tier Triple X IPA.  I decided on that, but upon delivery, it was not triple X but Nu Skool IPA.  Ok not a big deal. We ordered and she disappeared.  Literally did not see her again until our food came, which was at least a 25-minute wait.  Back to my beer.  Word of advice, and I should know better, do not order the oddball beer in a hometown bar.  It was terrible.  I noticed the DOB on the bottle.  It was over 6 months old.  Well since our server was MIA there was no one to tell and I lived with it.   Quite gross.  Waitress arises, at this point another table had become occupied by what appeared to be a father and son.  Our now seemingly frazzled waitress, though there was only us and the other table, delivered our food.  I ordered a cup of soup, chicken tortilla, and a roasted beet salad with grilled chicken.  She delivered the salad, and forgot the dressing.  She quickly brought some out though I hardly used any.  The salad was not bad.  I asked to add red onion and tomatoes since it did not come with and she accommodated me.  My biggest complaint, the whole reason I ordered the salad was because it came with roasted beets.  I love beets.  I eat them all the time and these beets were not only not roasted they were straight out of a can.  That hardly makes this salad worthy of being called a roasted beet salad.  The chicken was also a little on the tough side.  My husband ordered a pizza to which he said was ok.   After we ate we sat for a while waiting for the waitress.  Now the table behind us, with the father and son duo (guessing here) had a visitor from the bar stroll over and settle down for a nice loud and obnoxious visit.  I am not a prude, but if I wanted to hear the f bomb 10 times in a 5-minute span I would go elsewhere.  This is not a reflection on the establishment since you cannot blame the staff for other customer's belligerency, but what you can blame the staff for is partaking in the same manner of speaking while talking to that table.  Our obnoxiously drunk neighbor asked the waitress why she was down, and she said what I can't just not smile and you think I'm down?  I should not even f***ing be here I quit 8 months ago.  Um check please!  So on the way out we figured out why they waitress was so MIA.  She was hoping between two cars smoking with some guy.  She probably should have just quit and not come back, she clearly did not care about being attentive.  All in all the best thing I can say about this place was it was cheap.  So if you are a cheap person and quality does not matter, enjoy."}
{"text":"Had a blast on Sunday night !! The bar tender was amazing so friendly and made my sister and I feel like we were at home the bar is small but. By far one of the best I've been too! I'll be returning to this place for sure!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the bar tenders are all super nice! I love the fiesta chicken wrap with fried,chicken! The chicken is always juicy never dry! It comes with a large portion of,fries and a pickle. The long island ice teas are also really good."}
{"text":"Dinners for two and three drinks $30.00 not bad.. good food. Waitress very nice. Cozy"}
{"text":"Only been here a couple of times but I love their food. The menu changed since last time but tonight was prime rib night for $14. Prime rib for $14 with 2 sides. Hell yes, I took the deal and it was delicious. My wife had lemon pepper cod and it also was amazing. Perfectly cook fish. Good vibe, not too busy, and the owner came around and asked everyone how they were doing. Good people, good food and cold beer. makes me happy. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"The dipping sauce that came with the (whole) wings is excellent! Smoky and spicy but very well balanced.   Nice feel in the restaurant.  Service was a little slow but you can tell the food is prepared with attention to detail.  The cost is not bad either, for the quality of the food.  All in all a very pleasant experience and we have been back several times since."}
{"text":"I'm not from the area and was just looking for a nice little place for lunch and the Broad Street Bistro is a unique spot that combines a clean, modern atmosphere with the home comfort of a restaurant as well as bar. The food is almost artisanal with very unique and delicious options that I was genuinely surprised about. I ordered the Salmon and Zucchini flat bread with fresh mozzarella along with two house salads."}
{"text":"Very good food. Great food & beer prices. Highly recommend. Prime rib Wednesday very good. Thursday wing night. Jumbo wings also had French Dip sandwich. All very good."}
{"text":"The food was really great and the waitress was friendly, but we waited a very long time for or appetizers and meals. We arrived at 12:30 and we didn't get our appetizers until 1:20. The owner filled our drinks once, but mostly sat at the bar talking to a friend. The waitress was working alone and did the best she could, but we felt bad for her with no help."}
{"text":"This is a great little bar / restaurant.  There is a divider that runs between the horseshoe bar and the double row of tables and booths.  But you can step through the divider, so we are all one big happy family.  Although I've never sat at the bar, there is always a crowd of seemingly happy people laughing and joking.  NOT a drown your sorrows kind of place, more a \"Cheers\" kind of place.  The food here is very good, very freshly prepared and portions are generous.  We've been coming here for 30 years - Lighthouse, (something else for a while), Hurricane Alley and now the Bistro.  We started with BBQ Pork Cups - a very filling appetizer that could easily be an entr√©e.  Also, Fried Pickles with Chipotle sauce, both great tasting.  Hubs had the Meatloaf and declared it very good.  Son had the Philly Cheesesteak and fries.  Too much for him to finish, so half went home.  NOTE:  their French Fries are better than the Potato Patch, no lie.  I had the Salmon Salad and although I didn't care for the Balsamic, it was on the side - salad was fresh and the salmon was perfect.  It's a pretty great food stop, and no longer a dive bar with their recent upgrades.  And the service is ALWAYS friendly!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and just love it. Last night the Pens were winning 7-0 while we were there and the place went wild! The food is always fantastic. I had the amazing meatloaf and my date had the half rack of ribs. Everything was just incredible and the portions are generous. The service was awesome and the cobbler was just perfect. We will be back abd can't wait"}
{"text":"My wife and I knew we would be in the area on a Friday night so we did some research and found this little restaurant.  We wanted to find a place that had some good drinks and decent food.         We walked in and they had a nice looking bar on the right side and on the left there were tables and booths to sit at.  Nobody greeted us so we just sat down in a open booth.  A few minutes later our waitress politely greeted us and said she would be back to get us some drinks.  We were looking at the drink menu but our waitress said that it wasn't up to date.  We both ordered a beer and started to look over the food menu.         They had decent choices on their menu but I just ended up going with a pizza.  I was hungry and it seemed like a good Friday night meal.  My wife ended up going with one of their salads.  On the menu it says that they use fresh ingredients so it can take a little bit of time to prepare the food.  It did take a little time to come out but since I read that I was totally fine with waiting.       We weren't too impress with their beer menu here.  If you like the typical Bud lite, Coors lite, yuengling this is the place for you.  We like craft beer and they didn't have a good selection here for us.  The IPA that my wife ordered was skunked.  Our waitress let us know what was on tap and I got a Blue moon but she failed to mention that they had a Sam Adams Seasonal which I saw at the bar.  Maybe they were out?       Anyways the food came out and that's where it kind of got weird here.  First the food.  My wife's salad was average and my pizza was ok.  I did appreciate the fresh ingredients.  The breading was good on my pizza but I only got pepperoni and cheese and I probably should have gotten more on it to make it better. The sauce was bland too.  I took half my pie home and after reheating it actually tasted better at home.  So it was a decent pizza after all.       Now the weird part.  A older guy who had thrown back a lot at the bar came and joined what looked like a father and his teenage son at a booth next to ours.  He was talking loud and it was kind of funny but we would have sat at the bar if we wanted that type of interaction when we were eating.  Then our waitress stops by to talk that table.  She was explaining how she put in her two week like 8 weeks ago and she doesn't want to be there.  She seemed like a good waitress at first but then it seemed like she had other things to do and just wasn't around.  Maybe our food was ready sooner and she wasn't around to get it?  It also took forever for her to get our box and bill too.  It was a little uncomfortable.  When we left we actually seen our waitress outside with a guy in a car smoking.  I guess that's where she was and clearly didn't want to be there.  So overall it's an ok restaurant/bar.  Food was ok the beer was below average.  We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing surprise! I initially tried this place on a whim but after being seated with my family we had excellent service and the owner actually came back and spent time with us. The food was well prepared and the prices were more than fair at happy hour. I will try this 0lace again for sure..."}
