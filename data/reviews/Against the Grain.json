{"text":"For the view it's definitely worth coming by from time to time ! The food is meh but their drinks are pretty decent especially the pitcher sangria. We complained about one of the dishes as it was too bland and wasn't what we expected at all. Our waitress went on to say that it's normal but took the courtesy of covering that dish for us on her own so we naturally tipped her a lot - in conclusion customer service was great."}
{"text":"Though I swore I would never go back, I found myself here again a few weeks ago, though not by choice.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good the service was, and even more surprised at how much I actually enjoyed the food. It wasn't the best food I've ever eaten, but definitely enjoyable.

Mind is changed. I would come back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place with a great patio and great food! Against the grain did not disappoint! The patio was huge and beautiful, and is right on the water so we got to watch some neat boats go by while enjoying our meal. The food was delicious! We had the pulled pork, nachos, fish and chips and babaganoosh. Every single one of these dishes was above and beyond!

It wasn't just the food and view/patio that was amazing, our server was also top notch. She was right on top of refills, but not in your face every 5 minutes. She was very friendly and informative.

I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Absolute horrible service . Waited 10 minutes for the server. Drink came after 20 minutes . We were so hungry and had to wait really long for our food. Second round of drink came after food was finished . I had to ask for forks and knives . Patio was dark. Couldn't see what we were eating. Overpriced fish and chips tasted awful. Fries were soggy and old. Nachos tasted bland . Waiter had to ask me to hold my phone flashlight to use the credit machine . Also missed part of the order . The waiter told us nobody tips them due to lack of support  from bar and kitchen . 

It's not family friendly at all. If you have kids do not go there.  

Food quality , service level tells me the business is aiming for a quick buck with no long term goal destined for failure at every level ."}
{"text":"Really 0 stars except for the great view. Pulled pork completely awful, it was served cold even when I returned it to be warmed up. The pork was drowning in overly sweet sauce, I've had better from street festivals. The ceviche tacos had an okay taste but water was just dripping out of the fish-so weird. The manager came out to ask what the issue was at least, apologized and offered us coffees- which they then charged us for!! The service was slow although  friendly but they got our simple orders wrong. If you're a decent cook at home pack a picnic and eat at sugar beach there's nothing special here. They're likely still open due to the great location and the patio. I'll be shocked if they make it through the winter. Small overpriced portions- don't bother."}
{"text":"Great location with an isolated patio away from the very touristy harbourfront that is west of Yonge.  You do have to walk by some industrial factory to get there along lakeshore but once you reach the restaurant it's quite nice.  Food is so-so but beer selection is quite good for a harbourfront location (for those who love their beer).  Also, we had live music on the day we came.  Great way to waste a summer afternoon.  Will definitely be back for some nice summer beers by the lake."}
{"text":"I attended a friend's birthday dinner at ATG this past weekend.  Yes, we were a group, but honestly, this is not the first time they have had a group since opening. 

Service was deplorable.  The quality of everything was just terrible.   First, I was shocked by the prices.  Wine was outragious and incredibly overpriced.   They were out of several types of beer and ciders.   apparently they had a promo for Stella on a Friday and did not restock for the rest of the weekend.   Unfortunately, they were out of several dishes, which is not uncommon but they were out of quite a few items. 

The server did not have confidence.  It was an incredibly long wait for food and when the food arrived it was simply unappetizing.  The plate looked thrown together.  It seemed the kitchen was over it's head and could not deal with the amount of demands placed on them. 

the restaurant, concept and location is lovely. 

please please please, wait for them to get a hold of themselves before eating and spending both money and time at this location.  it isn't worth the B52 they toss around to attempt an apology. 


shame shame shame."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night for dinner.  I was of course, drawn to the patio and it is amazing.  Unfortunately, the patio is really the only selling point to the place. 

As has been previously mentioned (many times) in past reviews, the service is simply terrible.  My friend ordered a second pint and didn't receive it until the waiter came to pick up our empty dishes and ask us if we wanted dessert!  It didn't really seem super busy to me either - I just got the feeling that the servers couldn't care less.  Now, sitting in front of the lake on a beautiful night with a cool breeze blowing does make you a bit more lenient about things, but the service was actually quite ridiculous.

The food was okay (no complaints there) and they had a nice beer selection.

I would come here for drinks when you are in the mood to just sit for a few hours and not worry about getting served quickly."}
{"text":"Against the Grain Urban Tavern is a great place to grab a bite before a show at the Kool Haus (too bad KH is closing, one less excuse to go there!).  We dropped in on a stormy night before a concert and let the server know we wanted to be in and out within an hour, which they were able to make good on.

With the storm brewing, we were seated inside, but thanks to the big windows, we had just as good a view of the lake as if we were on the patio.  I ordered the ATG Signature Burger (Alberta Angus beef, topped with Mill St. Stout bacon & onion jam, aged white Cheddar, house smoked bacon and a beer battered onion ring) and it was delicious - the sauce/jam added just a little sweetness.  I paired it with a Spearhead White IPA which was good - I followed my instincts and it was our waiter's #2 recommendation for pairing.  His first was something darker (which I can't recall now), but probably would have been even better.  My wife had the Fish & Chips and their ATG Mojito which were both passable, but not quite excellent (for the Mojito, maybe more/different sugar?).  Still, the overall experience made me wish the dockside area was in my regular flight pattern so that I'd have more frequent chances to visit."}
{"text":"I felt raped by the expensive prices, but they do have a great patio

I dropped in for a drink and snack before the Metric concert; the weather wasn't great but we nabbed a spot on the patio. They have a wide selection of beer, I'm not sure what beer connoisseurs would think of the selection though. I am gluten-sensitive so was looking for a cider; disappointed the only cider they had on their extensive drinks menu was Thornbury which I passed on. So I ordered Mill St. Tankhouse Ale - wish our waiter had indicated it was on special for $5 a pint, I had no idea until the bill came. On my second order, I realized they had gluten-free Nickel Brook (its 's so beer); of course it came in a bottle but was nearly twice as much as the Tankhouse. I would have suffered to save some bucks.

But the kicker was the sweet potato fries. I didn't bother looking at the menu, I just ordered them up. They came in a very cute fryer basket. They tasted great, nothing special. When the bill came, they cost me $9! WTF. Serves me right for not looking at the menu.

So not a huge fan, especially because their prices are outrageous, but their patio would be amazing on a sunny day. Also noticed some people who ordered a pulled pork sandwich or burger - that looked amazing."}
{"text":"The food is ok, nothing special. I ordered a steak, I had a feeling I shouldn't have and I should have trusted my gut. The first steak they served me was well done when I asked for medium. The man at the table beside me had the same problem. The second steak they brought me had the same problem and again so did the man beside me. 

My boyfriend ordered a burger and it wasn't bad not much to say about it. The best thing on our plates was the fries. 

The location is amazing I would like to go during patio season and have a nice drink or two and order some fries. The patio here is right on the lake."}
{"text":"Some of the best food we had during our stay was at ATG.  The bartender was great.  They have a really nice beer selection, including some of the local craft beers, rather than just the standard Rickards, Alex Keith, and Molson.

Definitely on the list of must stops next time we're in town."}
{"text":"A beautiful location by the water but three strikes and your out. Confusing and margarita for a mojito , mixing up pork for beef and trying to convince me chickens have hair rather then feathers. This all before our mains have arrived. Which we're still currently waiting for. 30min and counting."}
{"text":"Basically you are paying for the patio location on the lake front.  
The menu is uninspiring as it is bar food - they call it an urban tavern.  Burgers are $18 but for the same price I got the 8oz streak and fries. We went on a Wed. night about 6pm so it was not hard to get in. Service was fine with lots of staff around.  Our waitress was probably new as she did not know about the specials - we asked before ordering - we later found out there was a special she should of known about. 

The patio seating area is very large so if you have a big group, this may be an option for you (there was a 20+ group while we were there).

This is good place to go for drinks but not for the food. It is worth to try at least once."}
{"text":"We came here because we could not get into terroni 
It turned out to be a nice surprise but is also a bit of challenge. 
The ambience was great. We ordered the special Baji chicken on pita bread, burger and braised lamb shank. 
The sample beer was a delicious surprise . For 5.95, you can sample 3 types of beer. 
The other surprise which we did not imagine was that the chicken tasted like their pulled pork . We asked the server who agreed with with us. But the chef in kitchen said it was chicken, since we are okay with pork , we ate it anyway . 
The burger was quite good. 
The lamb shank was also tasty but the carrots were rock hard, resting among the well cooked asparagus on top of the well mashed potato. 
Service was attentive and the server came by often enough to provide good service. 
So to make this place better, they need to really check on their overall delivery - biting into tough carrots was not great experience. 
I would go back again if it improves a bit more"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to checking this place out, but was disappointed.  
I ordered a chicken club sandwich and a beer for lunch.  The beer was great, but the club sandwich was bone dry, needed to drown it in mustard and hot sauce to make it edible."}
{"text":"We reserved for a large group of about 15-20, which was for an after wedding party.  Went there on Sun May 20th, around 6 or 7 pm start time.   Our party had guests from as far away as L A who were here for the wedding the previous eve.  I should also note that at least half the members in the party either owned or own restaurants or bars and work or have worked extensively in the industry. 

Terrible experience: 

1. Food was sub standard and substitutions were not offered - for example - steak 

2. Server, although polite, was not trained.  The bills were sent back for corrections not once, not twice, but THREE times.  Server said computer was \"malfunctining\". Clearly, the poor girl was in well over her head with no support from the \"manager\" that evening

3. We moved to the patio after dinner for drinks - the server (younger guy) ignored us for most of the time - came by twice in two hours to refresh the drinks.  The drinks are overpriced to start with, but the amateurish service is inexcusable

4. When we complained to the \"manager\", she told us the general manager had quit earlier in the week  and she had been brought in from another company-owned restaurant in the Distillery District.   To \"compensate\" us for the problems, she handed out $10 coupons (which had an expiration date the following week). ( By my estimate, we had spent as a group over $1500 that evening )

As one of my friends, who has owned and operated successful restaurants in Toronto for over 25 years, said \"How could the owners and investors in this place spend over a million bucks to design it and build it, and then have poor service and poor food when running it?  They are shooting themselves in the foot.\"  Exactly.

This place has a prime spot in Toronto on the waterfront and they are taking advantage of it and taking advantage of naive customers with high beverage prices, sub-standard food and lousy, amateur hour service."}
{"text":"Consider this a double review (or a double warning) about eating at both locations I've frequented - Queen's Quay and Laird.  Puzzling, both offer great decor, service and overall vibe, especially the lakefront patio. I recommend both highly for their beer selection as well, serving the best from Mill Street among others.  But the food is atrocious!  I've punished myself by going back to both locales and being disappointed over and over again by the bland recipes and stingy portions.  If you have to eat, go with the flatbreads.  Otherwise, drink up, enjoy the view and head elsewhere for your meal."}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre.  I ate there several times.  The music is WAY too loud, and the manager refused to turn it down when we asked, I overheard him telling our server that the loud music was part of the atmosphere, and if we had a problem with it, too bad. 

The quality of the food is unpredictable - sometimes its good, and fresh, and sometimes you can tell it's been sitting on the line for way too long.  All the staff  here is run off their feet.  I don't know what their problem is, but there is something seriously wrong with the management."}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews, but in some cases they are warranted. 

After an afternoon at Sugar Beach, my friend and I popped in for dinner and drinks. The same server walked by us 4 times without even looking at us, much less greeting us or smiling. The hosts had no idea what they were doing and even though the restaurant and patio were half empty, didn't know where to seat us and initially tried to put us at a dirty table. 

We were finally given a table, but then a big group was seated right next to us and the noise was excessive. I asked if we could be moved to a different table, and then felt like a monster because the host got totally stressed out and didn't know where to put us. 

We got a quieter table, and it took going through six bundles of rolled cutlery to find a set that was both clean and didn't contain hair. Not even kidding. 

Everyone who works there looks totally burned out and just...done. Our server noticed the pile of cutlery we didn't want to eat with, and apologized, but you could tell she was only half there. The food was so blah, we couldn't even lie about it convincingly. She sent a manager over but the guy was clearly just exhausted and going through the motions. He tried to give us a bunch of free stuff but it wasn't what we were after. We just wanted decent food!

I had thought about going back just on the strength of the patio, but never again. It's a badly run place with sub-par food and the service is ridiculous. Giving away free stuff doesn't make up for bad food and service, and everyone who works there looked just plain miserable. Not what I'm looking for when I want to relax and have a good time."}
{"text":"Have been to Against the Grain three times so far this summer. All in all, the food is not spectacular, but the patio and fire pit more than make up for it. Expect to wait for a table on the patio unless you get there super early.
They also have great daily specials (angus burger and flight of beers for $15 on Wednesday's) and a decent selection of beers. 

Stay away from the charcuterie board and the fire pit closest to the entrance (it's fickle and needs to be relit every 10 mins....they told us it was low on gas, but if that was the case, why couldn't they refill the gas or change the tank?)"}
{"text":"Great location. great staff, great atmoshpere....awful food. I'd recommend this place for a patio drink by the water. But go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Restaurant was a hit because of the service and location. The view of the lake and the Island is outstanding. I hope to return in the summer when you can sit outside. The parking is an issue especially for people with mobility issues. You have to park across the street. Our waitress was terrific meeting our requests without question. We had the nachos to share as an appetizer which was plenty for 3. Two of us had the roast beef special for Sundays. The meal was fine but not the best. When you have had the best you compare all dinners to it to see if one can surpass it. We will continue to frequent our favorite restaurant up north for our Roast Beef dinner fix but this place is still worth a visit. One of us had the salmon and it was good. I am not saying the roast beef dinner was not good, just not as good as our place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times when the weather was above 20 degrees and the sun shining.  The second time was Saturday evening.  

I ordered the same thing I ordered last time (mushroom flat bread and an order of sweet potato fries).  I asked for the fries to be extra crispy (they were) and the flatbread was great on it's own.

But what this place really has is the location --- and that's what this place is all about.  You're looking over the water with your meal and in Toronto, these are moments to enjoy! So, you can say if it wasn't for the location it might not be as good etc.. but they do have that location and it makes everything that much better.

Service: We had a new server who just started a week ago. She was friendly and tried to make things work.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"don't be fooled by the look, location is great but that's where it stops,horrible service, horrible hostess over all horrible experience.  
Food was not that great and menu was deceiving.  the butter milk fried chicken isn't what you think it is, it honestly didn't even look like it was fried.  Kale salad was thrown together by a child with a few shavings of cheese and barely any dressing.   there was a miss communication with the hostess in which she continued to be rude about.  Another hostess came by to assist us and she was pleasant and apologetic about the situation.  Server had to ask me what I had ordered 3 times, skipped a couple of people at my table when taking orders, and still charged us for an extra meal, beer on promo for $6 she said the first one she would give it to us for $6 and charged us full price for it, when we mentioned it to her that she had offered it at the beginning she had said she would have to speak to her manager.   We were in view of their conversation where she continuously rolled her eyes as they were speaking right in front of us. 50% of the bills were wrong, due to \"system malfunctions\" and also the lonnnnngggestttt paying process I have ever experienced.  Just overall poorly run restaurant, I would strongly not recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. The first time being the end of May. The weather was beautiful for a late Friday night. The patio was busy (as usual) but the ambience and service was good. We were here for a work friend's birthday group of 8 or 9. We ordered drinks and food and it was all delivered with speed and accuracy, considering it was a busy Friday night. The food was great. I ordered a burger and fries. My sister ordered a chicken flatbread.

My second experience, left me a bit unsatiated, as we left without eating. We were there for the RedPath Waterfront Festival at Sugar Beach and wanted to have a sit down meal. Our group of 5 asked for seats on the patio, at around 7:45 pm. We were given pagers and were told the wait would be about 45 minutes. We expected that, so we walked up and down the lakeshore. 
We were finally seated at about 8:30 and ordered food and drinks right away. At 9:30, we still hadn't received our food. It's not like we ordered huge meals, we ordered two flatbreads, a salad to share, and shrimp something. We flagged down our waitress, and she informed us that we would have to wait ANOTHER 20 MINUTES. We had somewhere to be at 10, so we said forget the food, bring us our drink bill. The manager came out and apologized for the wait, he explained a large party had come in and unexpectedly backed up the kitchen. He took care of our drink bill and gave us a $25 gift card to come back again. 

Even though our service wasn't the greatest, the fact that the manager came out and took care of our bill and even gave us a gift card, showed us that this doesn't happen often, and they were generally upset for us.

We will go back, not only because of our gift card, but because the patio is so nice, the drink menu is quite extensive and the food is pretty decent."}
{"text":"What a nice place ! 

The food is good :  I had a brie sandwich and friends had big burgers which looked yummy as orange county. 

The lcoation is just excellent : a little bit out of downtown, with a view of the lake. Perfect for a date haha !!! The place is class, nice, very clean. 

A big thanks to the waiter who had to deal with 17 french people :D 

Santé !!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a FIVE STAR patio!  This spectacular setting is extolled in every review, and rightfully so.  I cannot and will not dispute that!

However, the service and the food is the polar opposite and undeserving of the setting. 

As with many of their contemporaries, (e.g. Earls, South of Temperance, etc.) the wait staff is hired for their looks and not for their skills.  Frankly, if I ask for a round of water while trying to peruse your extensive  beer menu, please don't roll your eyes as you walk away.  

Beware the \"nachos\", which I put in quotes because these should actually be called \"chips with a smattering of cheese\".  Unless your personal tastes veer towards a preference of more-dry-chips-to-chips-with-actual-cheese-on-them, try something else on the menu.

Also, stay clear of the Chicken Flatbread (like the service I received, I am too lazy; I won't bother Googling the menu to accurately tell you the name of this dish.)  Sure, there's enough here for a table of four to enjoy with their $14 artisan craft beer, because after a piece, no one will want seconds.  The chicken on top is just shredded chicken breast, (mealy, dry, tasteless) and the same cheese mix they put (sparingly) on the nachos also makes an appearance here, but it doesn't add any additional flavour.  Maybe some salt and pepper could've helped, but these weren't available on any of the tables, so it had to be choked down as is.  I liken this Chicken Flatbread dish to Tim Horton's chilli.... looks like chilli, has the texture of chilli, but lacks any soul.

Definitely come for the patio, just don't ask for water first."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a late Saturday afternoon to have a bite and some patio drinks. Patio is great lots of tables and a bunch of lounge type seats. 
They have a decent listing of bottled beers that seemed on the high side but on average for a \"trendy\" spot. 
The food was just average I had the turkey burger special and my friend had the tavern burger which she discribed as Mcdonlads has a better burger. 
Over all I would say a solid med at 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"We recently visited Against The Grain while waiting for an open air movie on the nearby beach.  Our party consisted of 2 children and 4 adults, one of which is a restaurateur himself.  By the end of the night we all agreed that Against The Grain was one of those restaurants that were not situated directly on the waterfront it would never have survived its first year of business.

Service: When we entered there were 3 hostesses at their desk and it seemed each was reluctant to seat us.  We asked for a seat on the patio but were told that there were none available regardless of the fact that we walked past the patio to enter the restaurant and about half of the tables were still empty.  We assumed the patio staff was short and accepted a table inside.  Our server was nowhere to be found so we asked a hostess if she could send someone over.  I ordered their float of 4 craft beers (hoping to find something new) along with the rest of our drinks and exactly 18 minutes later a server brought our drinks.  Strangely, the server had no idea which of my 4 float beers was which and I just gave up trying to find out.  We had finished our drinks before the server returned to take our food order which took another 40 minutes to arrive.  Ironically one of the 7 year old children with us managed to say what we were all thinking.  When the server took another drink order from us he blurted out \"Daaaady, when is the food going to come? I'm sooo hungry\".  It was probably the highlight of the entire experience.

Food: None of us felt the quality of the food was anywhere near the price that they were asking.  I ordered the ATG Roadhouse Sandwich and my wife ordered the Wild Mushroom Flatbread.  Neither of which were particularly bad but they were basically what you would receive in any typical big box chain restaurant.  My wifes flatbread was a bit more disappointing than my sandwich as when you order something that is titled \"wild Mushroom\" you would expect more than just a few mushrooms scattered here and there.  When it first arrived I actually had to confirm with my wife that she did in fact order the wild mushroom flatbread and not something else.

Overall:  Our experience was more than just a bit disappointing.  Our wives and the children just felt the need to get out of the restaurant and my friend and I remained behind to wait (another 10 minutes) to pay the bill.  Needless to say none of us will be going back and in retrospect I kind of regret choosing Against The Grain when there were perfectly good food trucks out on the street."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and location are nice but the food was horrendously BLAND. 

I ordered the kale and quinoa falafel salad with grilled chicken. The \"falafel\" was just giant fried balls of unseasoned and wet quinoa. They were definitely not falafel and just fell apart the minute I cut into them. The grilled chicken was slightly undercooked and had absolutely no flavour. The baby kale salad with feta and cherry tomatoes was OK, but the charred lemon vinaigrette that was supposed to be present was not. 

My father ordered the lobster flat bread, which was also disappointing. The \"sauce\" was basically a weird melted Brie cheese with small bits of lobster meat, iceberg lettuce, and fried onions on top. It really didn't look appetizing and the ingredients shouldn't have been on the same plate. 

The only redeeming quality of this place is that you can sit outside by the water and they do have a good drink selection. But I would seriously advise not ordering the tasteless food."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I got the Tuesday special, the mac and cheese and it was awesome. Great flavors and the salad it came with was really nice. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Gorgeous patio, AWFUL service and even worse food.  Cold, frozen fries, ALL batter in the fish and chips.  Overcooked meat and pasta.  
The service is ridiculously slow and unapologetic for being ridiculously slow.
I may go again for a drink on a nice sunny day, but I won't ever eat there again."}
{"text":"I work nearby so I have tried almost everything on the menu. The ONLY item worth the price is the Cobb salad! It comes with a freshly baked pretzel, I add chicken to get some protein. Nothing else is better then I can make myself. When I go to a Resturant I expect a professional caliber of preparation. I've ordered steak and fish, both seemed like they were cooked by an amateur. 
Other then the one menu item, they have great atmosphere. Probably a better place to go pre-drink before the nights final destination. Waiting service is hit and miss, I have been very pleased with some and very disappointed with others. The bottom line is Loblaws across the street has better food then this \"Resturant\"."}
{"text":"I really like this place, but don't think I like \"Against the Grain\" as much as I like the location. I could spend all day on their awesome, spacious patio looking out over Lake Ontario towards the Toronto islands. The ever-burning gas firepits are a little odd and smell gassy if you're right next to them, but they do look cool.

They have a solid selection of beers. Great craft brews from Ontario as well as a long list of bottles from around the world. However, last time we were there they didn't have most of the bottles. Not sure if they were awaiting a shipment or just like to have a big menu of beers without actually having stock.

The food is decent, but overpriced for what you get. The best thing I've had at ATG is the Sugar Beach Signature Burger with smoked bacon, Havarti cheese, grilled pineapple, and tempura jalapeños. The patty itself is fresh and juicy and the tempura jalapeños are an awesome, gluttonous touch."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great! And you can't beat the location. Sugar beach is a wonderful spot in the city, perfect for sunny days. 

Since it's the only spot close enough to grab a pint and a meal, I'm sure against the grain's staff gets overworked and overtired. But that's no excuse for being rude."}
{"text":"Discovering the redeveloped Harbour front on Canada Day. Came across this restaurant overlooking the water. Live the ambiance,  outdoor patio is fantastic. Menu is great too. Nudged up under the new George Brown campus. Crowd is diverse in  culture and age. Staff is friendly knowledgeable.  Recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here on Victoria day 2016 with fiancé and 2 friends because the weather was nice and they have a huge patio. BIG MISTAKE. So, we went to get a table and the hostess informed us that there would be a 45min wait to sit outside so we chose instead to sit inside but at the window. Right outside the window there was a 4 person table free but we say nothing and take our seats. We wait a few minutes and our waiter comes over. We are very hungry so we order food and a pitcher of sangria in one go. Sangria comes, it's good, not really much for four people but it was okay. We wait for food,  and wait, and wait. 45mins later our waiter comes back to see is everything okay. We tell him we are still waiting for food.   He says he'll check(btw it was wings, hummus/pita and nachos so nothing too complicated). Another ten mins go by and finally a guy comes with our food. It's okay. But we are out of drinks and we have no cutlery or napkins. Finally after another while we get the attention of our waiter and ask him for water and napkins. He brings a jug of water and some cutlery/napkins and promises to come back with glasses. We eventually use our sangria glasses because no glasses ever came. At this stage we are pretty pissed off. We decide it's time to leave but cannot get anyone's attention to get our bill.  We ask 3 separate people. Even the manager sees us getting exasperated and instead of coming over to apologize, he sends a random staff member over to take our bill. We leave feeling annoyed and disappointed. I definitely would not recommend this place. 

Oh, and the table outside? Nobody sat there the whole time we were there. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out the restaurant for a while since I've walked past the area before and thought the view would be great.  I went for a lazy walk today and arrived there for brunch just after 11 without any reservations.  Here's how it went....

My Meal - 2 stars
To be clear, it's not the best spot for breakfast fare.  The menu only had 3 breakfast items (and I'm not counting 4th which is oatmeal because who the heck gets that when you go out). 
1. I had the beachside breakfast bowl is a cool combination out of all fantastic breakffast items.  I'm surprised that it didn't come with a salsa since it also came with beans and flour tortillas.. but it was a cool break from the typical bacon and eggs or meat eater breakfasts.  The menu says that it comes with grilled tomato but in retrospect, I think my plate was missing mine.
2. My girlfriend had the french toast.. which arrived with the edges burned to a crisp. It came with farmer's market sausage which was melt in your mouth.. but not in a good way. It seemed like the sausage disintegrated into a powder in my mouth.

Service - 2 stars
Waitress took forever to come with our drinks and food took a long time.  She also never came back so that we could order the $4 Caesers that were the special today that she also didn't advise us of but which we had to read about in the menu.

The View - 5 stars
You won't get too many views of this in Toronto. On a good day, you'll forget that you're minutes from the downtown core.  Unfortunately, today our view was blocked by a couple of large ships but that's no fault of the restaurant.

Their Patio Policy - 2 stars
We arrived just after 11 and were advised that only \"sun\" was available.  I thought ok that's fine, they  must be busy.  When we were guided to our table, we were right next to an umbrella, but it was covering a table for 4 that was \"reserved\".  I thought, ok that's fine, I understand that they should take care of people who made reservations, which we had not.  But the table for 4 didn't show during my whole meal there!  I understand that it gets awkward because the wait staff can't predict if I'm going to be long and the other party will show up early or whatever - but given the service that we had received with food, I wouldn't be surprised if the reservation was for 1pm.

How much I paid - $45 after tax and tip for 2 breakfast entrees, 1 coffee and 1 beer

Free tip - If you're going to sit on the patio on a hot day, make reservations and ask for an umbrella!

Good for - Someone with low expectations and/or is a bit more pro-active about getting better service (unfortunately, I am neither as I prefer not to create a fuss).  But more seriously, if you're looking to have a lazy day and to stay in the city but get a great view of Lake Ontario and the Toronto islands, this is your spot. You need a lazy day for the slow service. And low expectations because the food is meh. I would only bring tourists if their preference was for a place with a great view rather than a place with great food.

Will I go back? Maybe... I live pretty close so I might swing by on a nice day... but only if it was lazy day and I had no better plans... But it's certainly not a \"go to\" destination for me nor somewhere that would be my regular rotation of brunch spots."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch here on Sunday, around 2.

We had no issues with the hostess and she gave us the table on the patio that we had asked for. 

Food: 
We ordered the signature burger and the chop and pop salad. 
The burger was quite good, as were the sweet potato fries that we ordered with it. Te only issue was that the bacon was very fatty, which neither of us like - took it out, no problem. 
The salad was a large and interesting dish. The popcorn was not fresh, which sort of defeats the purpose of having it in the salad - why not serve it with toast instead?
I think the place is not the cheapest, but I wouldn't say it's excessively overpriced for the portions and quality. I guess I'm happy to pay 1 or 2 dollars extra for the view.

Service:
Our server got all our modifications right, so I cannot complain about that. 
It was a hot, sunny day, so it would have been nice to get more frequent refills on our water, and maybe come by every once in a while to ask if we wanted another drink. We had to wave very intensively for minutes to get someone to pay attention. 
I think the waitresses were attentive and polite, but were not working quickly enough - another interpretation is that the place is understaffed.
The manager helped them out from time to time, and service did get better once he also gave a hand. 

Overall, I'd go back again, order a different salad, and strategically finish my water every time a waitress is about to come by so that I can immediately ask for a refill."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my birthday in early June with some friends and was looking for a pleasant meal with a beautiful view. We ended up with a not so great dining experience (food was just average), enjoyed our drinks and received a complimentary dessert for my special day. What made this day better was the service I received from the staff. We had a really nice and very considerate service staff. When I mentioned to management that the meal could have been better it didn't go unnoticed. I want to personally thank Tim and this management team for looking out for our party. He was considerate, heard my concerns and empathized with our disappointment. The team invited us back for a redemption birthday meal with my friends and it was brilliant. We didn't go back and point out who we were in case of different treatment and the litmus test worked. The food was fresh and full of flavour. The service was consistent as the last  time, courteous and with a smile. 

When management take the time to hear about what their patrons have to say, the dining experience improves for everyone. Thank you to the ATG for a great second chance .... and birthday brunch :)"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Its great for drinks and lunch. There's a nice view of lake Ontario. Its also really good for drinks and dinner at night. They have fire pits going, heat lamps and they even provide blankets if it gets too cold. The drinks are expensive the food is over priced but it's downtown with a waterfront patio. Your paying foe the atmosphere. The food was ok. Nothing great."}
{"text":"I live just around the corner, and another location will be opening near my work soon, so I thought I should give it a try...

THE FOOD:  2 stars.  I had the cornish hen, served on a bed of rosemary potatoes and veg.  The potatoes and veg were well-cooked, but had turned cold, and were obviously waiting on a plate for a while to have the hen plunked on top.  The hen itself was hot, but somewhat rubbery and quite flavourless.

THE SERVICE:  1 star.  I ordered a drink.  The server seemed to forget.  I reminded.  She seemed surprised.  I reminded again.  Ohhhh, riiiiight, your drink, yes yes yes it's coming (I thought, so is the end of days; I wonder which will arrive first).  My drink was ordered well before my food came, but arrived after we'd finished dinner and were ready to leave.  It was about 25 minutes altogether.  No explanation was offered for the delay.  My meal was rather cold, but the server never checked in to see how things were until we had finished, when it was too late to do anything.  She seemed completely uninterested and incapable.

THE LOCATION:  4 stars.  It's right by the water, and there is a large military ship docked there now (Sept 1, 2012) so it's a cool atmoshpere.  There is also zero choice for alternatives as they are the only restaurant in this newly built up part of the waterfront. 

Overall, this reminded me very much of being a tourist in a foreign locale:  stuck in a very mediocre restaurant, eating bland food, with substandard service, paying too much for it, but in a nice location.  But, this is like a poor man's version of Queen's Quay, so if you like those restaurants, stay there, and if you don't like those restaurants, then give this place a very wide berth, because it really is crap."}
{"text":"Came here this past Sunday for canadian \"thanksgiving dinner.\"

The nachos and coconut curry mussels were pretty good.  I ordered the Dockside pizza for my meal, which was bland, but the prosciutto was probably the best part of it.  Apparently, they cure their own meats there.

I had tried a little bit of the penne off of someone else's plate, and found it bland and boring.  I also bit off a part of someone else's burger, and I found it to be rather dry.

Our server was nice, but the service was super slow, and nobody seemed to know what was going on with the usual Sunday Roast that they have there every week.

The best thing about this place is the outdoor seating by the water.  We had great weather for it, luckily for us."}
{"text":"After the fabulous CMYE at Against the Grain (Thank You again Vivek) I decided to book Against the Grain for a work party. It was an informal gathering, so no corporate spending account, or set menu, just a bunch of co-workers getting together. I dealt with the team at Fab Concepts for the reservation, and everyone was very professional and accommodating. 

They carved us out a large space on the patio with couch and lounge seating, along with a couple of tables. It was perfect. Over enthusiastic server Meaghan, who (despite forgetting to get me water on two occasions), was very friendly. As it was a Thursday, several co-workers took advantage of the $2 Sliders on special.

Bonus Points
- Humongous and Gorgeous Patio. One of the best in the city.
- Professional and Courteous Event Coordination staff  
- East End 
- Excellent for Corus Employees
- Sofas and Lounge sets with Fire Pits at night
- Overlooking the water
- Nice, New, Clean, Good Bathrooms
- NON SMOKING PATIO. Brilliant.

Minus Points
- Its expensive. The food is pricey think $12 for 3 appetizer tacos. $18+ salads and mains.
- Food is only decent, not great or outstanding. For the prices I expect much more.
- Difficult to get to, 20 min walk from Union or Bay St Bus
- Service is \"Ok\" I like servers that serve me, not try to be my friend. 
- Wine is Expensive. Another $18 for 9oz glass place. (average quality wine like $11 a bottle at LCBO wine )
- Cocktails are expensive, the house cocktail (while delicious!)  being $12
- After spending several weeks arranging this get-together for 30+ co-workers, the management made no appearance. It would have been nice if someone came by to greet us or check how we were doing. 

Basically, the Patio is killer, but for Bymarkesque Prices I want Bymarkesque food and service, you know what I mean?  Sure, I am a snob, but when my drinks and meal is almost $80 for just me, I am expecting something fabulous. ATG is an upscale (at least price wise), Milestones with a killer patio. The patio is really worth 2 stars."}
{"text":"The restaurant was great; we went on Saturday Aug2. The view is great as well as the food; I got the ribs and my wife got the ATG signature burger. My only 2 complaints was that where we sat there was no lighting above the tables, just from the patio lights which wasn't a lot and the service wasn't even average. I would definitely go back though."}
{"text":"This is defiantly my local favourite.
An above average looking bar with lots of upside. 
The bar has one of the best waterfront views and patios in the city. There is rarely ever a boat parked in front and less pedestrian traffic that other spots on the Queens Quay.
The bar sports an eclectic selection of better known and obscure fantastic beers. 
The menu is just as eclectic with an upscale version of several pub classics with some more exotic combinations. 
The weekly specials vary from donught burgers to pulled pork poutine.
As an added bonus every few months they host set course menu and beverage dinners that are completely worth it and really step up the menu.

Not just worth a visit...worth returning frequently."}
{"text":"We never got a chance to eat here. We were told that there would be a 15-20min wait to be seated on a 3/4 empty patio. Decided to take our business to someone that would appreciate it. We went to Watermark instead and had a lovely time."}
{"text":"To the Manager who didn't come to our table,

Tonight was the second night I've been to Against the Grain in a row. The first night I went for a team building experience with my work. The service then was pretty lax, however we chalked it up to the fact that there was an event going on so the restaurant was abnormally busy.

Despite the terrible service, I carried on with my plans to take my boyfriend and his friends to Against the Grain for his birthday tonight. It started off not bad. We only had to wait 10 minutes for our first round (does the sarcasm carry through text?). Everything went down hill from there. The burgers were disgusting. We did not complain however, considering that was not our server's fault.

After that, a member of our party joined the table and ordered a drink and a pizza. Her drink arrived ten minutes after her entree. We spoke to the server and asked for something to be done. She assured us that there would be a discount of sorts placed on our bill. That was fine, we were happy with that (Shall I spoil the ending? There was no discount on the bill after this gauffe).

We then ordered Five coffees. One black with Jameson and a side of ice, one black with a side of baileys, and three normal coffees.

One normal coffee came, with an Irish coffee with cream and a coffee with baileys. The gentleman who ordered the coffee with Jameson is lactose intolerant. When I brought this to the server's attention she argued with us and told us we had ordered an Irish coffee and this is how it is served. The fact that we had ordered a black coffee with jameson and ice seemed to be a moot point.

After this I asked to speak to a manager. I'm still waiting.

Honestly. This awful experience isn't worth the view, especially considering my party spent over $400 at this establishment.

I will never come to Against the Grain again. If anyone asks me about it they will hear nothing but the truth. There's literally nothing you can do to make me a happy customer. I'm paying you the courtesy of letting you know that your operations are flawed.

You all should be embarrassed.

Disgraceful customer service.

Sincerely,

A Disgusted Guest"}
{"text":"Went for dinner part of a 22 person group and all I can say is wow. I was totally expecting bad slow service but what we received was totally the opposite. So glad we weren't influenced by the bad Yelp reviews and decided to go anyway. Btw the filet mignon steak frites were some of the best I have ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"(Review for Brunch only)

Wife and I were looking for a place with a view where there wouldn't be a crowd for brunch on a recent Sunday and ended up in here. 

All I can say is that the chef and whoever is in charge of supplying this restaurant should be ashamed of him/herself.  Wife's scrambled eggs - rubbery and inedible - didn't even look like normal eggs.  Bacon - unrecognizable as actual bacon.  Tasteless as cardboard, with an odd and disconcerting texture.  

My over easy egg on top of a \"brisket hash\" was undercooked, verging on raw, and the egg yolk was mottled with different colours - shades of yellow, brown and a greenish tint. Never quite seen anything like that before - didn't know that happened to eggs.  

The hash was a whole other level of incompetence.  The supposed brisket was like little brown cubes of rubber, accompanied by raw-ish root vegetables.  Made me think fondly of cat food.  The toast was fine.  

Ultimately, didn't believe the kitchen had the competence or inventory to execute anything that wouldn't cause significant illness, so we quietly paid and left, our food uneaten.

I recognize that these folks have a captive audience in the Corus staff and that the dockside venue allows them a certain leeway.  We certainly didn't go there expecting food that would blow us away, but we did expect a baseline level of competence.  

How the h**l can you do that to bacon?"}
{"text":"The patio really is the best thing about the restaurant.  It is definitely a great view of the water.

The first time I came here, I ordered the glazed and confused salad.  The salad was completely overdressed that all I could really taste was the dressing.  The service was a little slow and they were still working out some kinks at that point.

For my second time, I ordered the pulled pork tacos.  There was too much sauce in the tacos and I found the overall flavours combined were too overwhelming and sour.

Overall, the food definitely needs to be worked on and I probably won't eat here again until the food is improved.  In the meantime, I wouldn't mind having a drink (or two) on their patio."}
{"text":"The patio is like a minefield all bunched together. There are much better patios in Toronto and more central than this one!"}
{"text":"Really impressive decor with one of the most impressive patios in the city, but the food is really hit & miss. Some of it is terrific, while it seems just as much leaves a lot to be desired. Some menu items that are listed as meals wind up being appetizer sized when it arrives. All for a premium price."}
{"text":"When we discovered Against the Grain, my hubby and I were thrilled to finally have a cool place to go to along our Harbourfront neighbourhood.  Unfortunately, our first visit last night was a huge disappointment.  The waitress serving us was miserable and the food was awful.  

We thought we would order a bunch of their appetizers to get a taste of a few things.  The lobster tacos were ok.  The mussels in thai curry sauce was nothing special, but what made it worse was that it was served with fries and ketchup, even though the menu says it comes with 'rustic bread'.  We asked our server why, and she actually said that it wasn't supposed to come with bread!  I mentioned that most mussels are served with bread to allow people to enjoy the sauce that it comes in, but then she became defensive and said that \"most people as for the fries and ketchup that's why it's served with it\".  Doesn't make sense to me. 

Our mushroom flatbread and chicken wings came next.  The mushroom flatbread was actually decent.  We enjoyed the taste of the truffle oil drizzled over top.  The chicken wings, however, we had to send back.  The chicken was so overcooked and tough that it was actually hard to yank the meat off the bone.  This is the first time we've ever sent back chicken wings as it's my husband's favourite, but this was just inedible.  We didn't take our server's offer to get fresh ones made and opted to just have it taken off our bill. 

We couldn't wait to get out of there after paying, waiting 10 minutes to get our change back, and not getting the water we had asked for.  We had to go to the bar to ask for the water.  Final stop was the washroom and that experience just made me realize how badly managed Against the Grain was.  Toilet paper was littered on the hall leading up to the washroom.  The washroom stall was out of toilet paper.  One of the faucets was out of order as was written on the crudely made cardboard sign taped on it said.  And 1 of 2 soap dispensers was out of soap. 

Overall, a bad experience that made me want to write this review to warn others."}
{"text":"A place with so much potential, especially considering the location and beautiful views. Service is absolutely awful. Came in the summer with a group of friends on the patio and it took nearly 20 minutes just to be greeted. Everything came in 30 minute periods, we had wasted our afternoon there. Food was decent, not that great. Every other guest looked just as confused as we did waiting around for so long. Gratuity was automatically added to our bills and we not only had to argue with our server that we didn't want to pay it, as we didn't feel it was deserved, but the manager as well. Would not ever come back here nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"3 of us went.  2 of us had horrible bland food.  1 of us had steak & frites, but was quite expensive for...steak and fries.  Not too sure how long they're going to last.  The single star here was for the location and our waitress, who was quite nice.  Not too sure about other places, but Toronto has a long list of places where staff should be booted in the lake, and not in front of customers.  I was looking for something much better, but this completely failed."}
{"text":"After spending a long day travelling we arrived in Toronto with the intent to eat near St. Lawrence market but due to Buskers Festival, there was no parking. Frustrated  we finally found parking down at the docks and discovered Against the Grain totally by accident.It was a Friday night and really busy on the patio.  We were tired and hungry and were about to turn away when the manager, Teresa Wilson, immediately took charge and managed to seat us quickly. 
We enjoyed one of the best tables on the patio, great food and the best service we have experienced in awhile.  Our special thanks to Teresa and the great staff that night for the memorable experience. And we were delighted to finally find a beautiful setting on the Toronto waterfront to eat. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Now here's a place on the waterfront that gets it! In a parade of bars and restaurants that struggle to get the simple things right like service - ATG absolutely excels! Great service, never waiting more than 10 minutes even on a busy summer evening when the patio is hopping. Servers have always been attentive and helpful. The menu focuses on several items they do well and a few change here and there. Great beer selection with some good craft selection. Awesome location right by the water and in an area that's starting to develop nicely. Being a local resident I've been here many times and can only say good things about it. Always an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my fiancé and would only recommend, if you're in the area and are lazy to go anywhere else. Food is hit and miss, I ordered fish and chips and it was surprisingly good, though someone else rated it as poor. My fiancé had fish in a bag based on someone's positive review and that turned out to be an extreme disappointment. Patio is nice and service is good"}
{"text":"Great View, that is ALL it has going for it. 

Snooty staff, if I want to have someone treat me with attitude I can go to KFC and have the 16 year old who doesn't want to be there serve me. 

Food was poor except the cheese and charcuterie platters which you can't really screw up. 

If you want to go in the afternoon or evening to have a couple of beers and sit by the water it is alright, if you want good food and/or service this is NOT the place to go."}
{"text":"Very disappointing if you are looking for decent food. Seriously, can't believe the prices they charge for their foods, it's like paying $17 for an expired Big Mac! On the other hand, the patio is lovey and they have a nice selection of drinks and beers. You'd do yourself a favour eating at one the nearby food kiosks at Harbour Front before coming here."}
{"text":"[ location / décor ]
The beautiful view of Lake Ontario from the patio is definitely this restaurant's main asset. Right next to Sugar Beach, a quick walk from Queen's Quay, and a nice bike ride from Cherry Beach.

They have large tables for big parties as well as nice little 2-person tables, as well as couches around fire pits. Very nice use of space.

[ service ]
Service has never been poor - can be a little slow on days when the place is filled up, but never an unreasonable wait. I needed a dairy-free meal and the waitress was very kind about switching out the butter brioche on the vegetarian burger for a different bun. I noticed she was very playful with the kids in the family sitting near us and repeatedly and patiently brought more ketchup and condiments.

[ food and drink ]
Cocktails are pricey ($9 - 12), but what you would expect for a place like this on the lakeshore. They are good, summery drinks.

I've had the truffle mushroom flatbread and the veggie burger, both of which were yummy but no more special than typical lakeside bar food.

[ conclusion ]
Food and service are more than fine - but ATG's selling point is definitely the location and the great views."}
{"text":"Liked it a lot - great patio and great atmosphere. Hope it does really well"}
{"text":"The food here is a ok. The patio here is amazing though. Especially in the summer time! It's right by the lake and the view is just gorgeous. The food here is also decent. They have delicious ribs and burgers. The service here could be a little better. I feel like our table wasn't given as much attention as we should. You can get s decent dinner for 15-20$ here. The bar menu is also pretty decent. They have some nice cocktails and also a decent bar selection. I would def recommend checking out the patio and giving this place a chance!"}
{"text":"I live within a 10 minute walking distance to ATG and we walk on the waterfront every weekend. We've been here about a dozen times and each time we leave feeling the same way... \"I can't believe we spent so much money on food that was so mediocre.\" 

Really and truly, the menu writes about food that is not the quality that you will receive. Plus, it's trying so hard to be trendy/exciting, when in reality, the food is just regular Canadian bar food... that is way overpriced! 

Personally, I think it's a huge waste of the waterfront. They have an amazing patio and space, so it would be nice to have a food experience that complimented that. Either lower the price or increase the quality of food. Easy Peasy ;)"}
{"text":"Beautiful location to have drinks and sit by the lake. 

The menu isn't inspiring and I usually just order a burger.   Last night I fought this instinct and had the steak special.   I ordered it medium rare and it came out rare.  The waitress took a very long time to come and check on us. 

It is a great place for drinks."}
{"text":"Great place for a beverage and snack or lunch on the water in the summer.  I recommend if you are a tourist."}
{"text":"If you are by the docks and looking for a patio with a lakeside view, 
Against the Grain has an amazing patio!

Yes, the food is overpriced and nothing really special.
But, it's almost like you are paying a premium to be by the water.
Also, it's located by Sugar beach and convenient if you are wandering east on the Harbourfront.

The salad I ordered with salmon was good.  The portion of salmon was generous and perfectly seared.

The butter tart doughnut for dessert was the right choice!  :D"}
{"text":"Service is good but the turkey burger I ate had no flavour and is dry. Not too sure if it's worth the $17."}
{"text":"Be careful when coming here.  Their uptight attitudes towards dining, who is and isn't served leaves a lot to be desired. Showed up with a group for a birthday party and they deemed us too loud to be seated. I won't be returning any time soon and I won't. Be recommending this spot to friends.   Zero hospitality and courtesy."}
{"text":"Fantastic patio by the water. Good service. Decent food. Good spot to hang out for a drink!"}
{"text":"My first time at ATG and I really enjoyed my time here. I didn't have high expectations of the food so I don't even remember what I ordered except I had a brunch item (eggs benny, etc...the usual).

But come on! You come here for the drinks, the PATIO, and the scenery. Because ATG is on a quieter side of Queen's Quay, you feel like you're just in a different part of the city. There is a lovely path you can walk to get to ATG and then you see a little sandy beach (but you can't swim) and a huge patio that is ATG. Came here with my friends to just chill and relax and soak up some sunshine.

I highly recommend coming to this patio, as it is not commercialized at all, not touristy, and really right on the lake."}
{"text":"Food: I ordered the signature burger and it was okay. It was average but good. My friend ordered a whiskey drink that came with Bacon and it looked amazing and as per her is was really good. 

Service: There was a short wait for a table but we were given candy while we waited which was a nice plus. The waitress was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and checked on us a few times to see if we needed anything. 

Ambiance: The restaurant is near the water which made the ambiance very calm and relaxing. 

Pricing: The price of the food was appropriate (Disclaimer: I am basing this off of American dollars)"}
{"text":"Great view. Terrible service. Patio was half empty and hostess wouldn't seat anyone. Hostess said it was to make sure existing patrons got a high level of service. I asked if that meant they didn't have enough wait staff to which she said responded no.

Looking through other reviews, it appears this is a common practice at this establishment to not seat customers when there are many spots free. Skip."}
{"text":"Came here on the off chance because it was a sunny day and a friend lives not too far from there although a car was still needed as it is kind of out the way from anywhere else.

When we arrived (group of 3) it was still sunny outside and the patio had plenty of empty tables so why we were kept waiting for a sea outside I have no idea. Unless there were reservations or they wanted to plan for the later rush, which did arrive. 

I am a big fan of anything that is by the lake so that usually gets a star there. 

A few pints of beer later and some lovely appetizers we left satisfied customers.

We did not order any mains but I did end up salivating over the table next to us when their food arrived so next time I am here I will eat properly.

The service in general was great, the staff are on the ball and friendly.

EDIT

forgot to add the beer here was great, closest thing to a decent pint, although pricey because I think it was a German or Belgium import."}
{"text":"Hands down, the patio is the best part of dining at Against the Grain. The view is lovely, full sun exposure unti around 6pm (in the summer) before it dips behind the Corus building, and the staff was particularly friendly as well. You may even catch a scenic sailboat race (Tuesday nights)!

NOW, the food: upscale pub fare and fantastic desserts. The menu is great, lots of choices, and lots of interesting twists on the classics. The staff was great about accommodating changes as well (we switched up our roasted chicken nachos for pulled pork nachos).

The poutine is a daily creation (we had peameal bacon & fried onions), and some of the other goodies on the menu include steamed mussels, glazed duck salad, delicious oven-backed pizzas as well as comfort food favourites like fish & chips, chicken pot pie and steak frites. The prices are a little steep, starters $10-$15 and mains for anywhere from $13 (burgers or grilled cheese) - $20ish (Duck confit or sablefish).

The food is very good (not knock-your-socks-off) but the desserts really outdid themselves. For $7 we had an amazing vanilla & raspberry creme brulee, and a $9 banana cream pie (that was HUGE)!

They also have daily specials - Tuesdays are $5 Rolling Rock & .49 cent wings! Maple chipotle (very hot), Texas BBQ, butter chicken and one more flavour that escapes me...

All in all, a pleasant patio experience - the question is, will people venture down to the water mid-January?"}
{"text":"I concur with most other review that the patio space and view of the waterfront is one of the best in the city.  Unfortunately the food is not good.  I found most everything we ordered was overcooked.  Their signature burger was dry, their pizza bland.  Of the fish and chip dish, the fish was a decent size, moist, but the batter had no seasoning.  The chips was also dry and not enjoyable to eat, in fact I left more than half the fries untouched.   If not for the fab scenery, I would give this review a 1 star soley on the food.   But the view is that amazing on a sunny day - I would ONLY come here for drinks.

PS - You can get your parking validated only you park in the underground garage.  You have to pay first, then bring half the receipt to waiting staff to get the parking amount deducted from your bill."}
{"text":"You are paying (richly at that) for the patio lake view. Think $21 burgers and $17 flatbreads. A burger and beer lunch will start getting close to $40 with tax and tip. I had a rib special that was insanely over-salted. Beyond that, food is largely inoffensive but forgettable. There was one seasonal pickerel dish with fava beans that did taste very fresh and was the one stand-out. Service was fine for us, cool but fairly efficient. It's just the price points are far too high for a casual eatery."}
{"text":"The location was awesome!  It's right next to Sugar Beach and it's where the Corus building is.  You can see the water if you sit on the patio...and they have plenty of patio space.  
I must say though that although the location was great, we didn't find the food all that great.  You pretty much have your option of pub food.  I order their house special burger and substituted the side with sweet potatoe fries.  The burger was a little dry and the sweet potatoes fries were a little soggy.  The fish and chip was also a bit dry and was made with a lot of batter.
If it wasn't for the location, I don't know if I would come again for the food.  I'll come back again for a drink and perhaps appy.  There is no other restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"I ate at this location on Saturday.  I found the hostess at this location to be very unfriendly, furthermore, we mentioned that we were sharing our dish, they did not give us an extra  plate or even napkins to use for our fish Taco. Imagine being served water in such a filthy glass. I felt sick to my stomach and decided that we were not going to order additional food.  I thought that if they are serving water in such filthy glass, I question the cleanliness of the kitchen."}
{"text":"the scenic view pretty much sums up this place.

2/5 the food is quite bland

2/5 the prices are quite high, although the selection of beer is quite good.

2.5/5 the servers are average.

{"text":"Poor service. We waited for 10 mins and no server came to take our order.  We have asked other servers to find our server.  Need to wait for another 10mins.  Server finally came but he claimed they are under staff.  Seriously?!? On a Sunday brunch time? Coffee came immediately but without any mike and sugar. We waited for another 10 mins and still not seeing the server bring anything to us. We ended up need to go the bar and asked the bartender ourselves.  Food was disappointed. No one refill the coffee until we asked!!! Again, without milk and sugar!! We have not finish our coffee and we did not ask for bill yet, but bill was on our table. This was our first time visit but with very disappointed service here and will never come back again."}
{"text":"We come here because it's in our office building, and the ambiance is nice. HOWEVER, the food is mediocre at best, and the value is terrible. I paid 42$ after tax+tip today for a burger ($20) + drink ($11 tiny mimosa). Oh also they have some weird salad with popcorn in it, and of course they're all expensive. I hate this place, and La Prep too."}
{"text":"Never written any reviews prior. However, due to a bad customer service experience. I believe there is need for the public to know. 

 my boyfriend and I \"walk out\" the restaurant because after we were seated; no one I'm meant no one acknowledged us, no water what so ever for a good 7 minutes. It was busy but not packed. The table came in after us got an immediately  welcome from a waiter. There were multiple times waitresses/waiter had seen us but I fail to understand the reason of them not servicing us and the hostess was so busy focusing on her clip board, completely ignored us were just waiting to be served. So we finally decided to walk out because we were unwilling to spend our money there. I wanted to talk to the manager to warn her the poor customer service and how disorganized the restaurant is. I asked for the manager and told the waiter what a bad experience we just received. He wasn't even apologetic. All he said was oh my manager is Dana and she is there... Oh she's coming. I said we are leaving and got the response \"Oh ok.\" 

I previously been to this restaurant four times and had a good time but I'm afraid will never go back again unless there is a new management or new restaurant. 

The one star is for the view and sunshine."}
{"text":"Only shared an appetizer and one main. They were good and the service was adequate. Nothing special.

The view from the deck is great and we enjoyed the dinner, although it was nothing ground breaking."}
{"text":"I came here recently for their Winterlicious dinner menu. When I got there, the atmosphere and restaurant setting was pleasant. But by the end of the evening, I was really disappointed and it's all towards their food.

As an appetizer I chose their grilled oyster. When it came, I literally thought they gave me empty shell! There was only one oyster. It was sooo small and when I ate it, I think it tasted more like the cream sauce than the oyster itself.

For the entree, my choice went to the cider-brined pork chops. Of all the meat steaks I've had at restaurants, this was one of the worst - very disappointed. Not sure why but they made the outer layer super salty (both top and bottom). The saltiness even simmered through to the middle too. Every bite was just salty!

The mashed potatoes on the side weren't great either. They weren't fully mashed up and doesn't have much taste like those double-baked potatoes. Possibly not enough butter cooked with it. The actual good thing was the braised meat bits chopped up and placed on the side.

The dessert was alright. It was apple fritter pieces. However, the inside part of the fritter wasn't too flavourful - more dough. Overall the dinner wasn't very fulling for the party I went with, especially the guys.

On the positive side, the waiter was really friendly but the food took off the restaurant's points. The atmosphere was pleasant as well as the decor. The place is actually quite big and can fit many parties. I especially loved their setting with the light bulbs hanging from the ceiling and wooden theme :)

Meh. Oh well."}
{"text":"In the summer, it's the best patio in the city. AtG is right on the water with views of Toronto Island and the sailing camps. Get a spot under an umbrella if it's a hot day as you can cook out there in all the sunlight bouncing off the lake. 

The menu items that we've tried and liked are the pulled pork tacos, wurst platter, and Lola Rosa Leaf Salad with the roast salmon. They do change the menu periodically and have weekly specials so there's always something new to check out.

Service is very very very slow, the food is expensive (think upscale Milestones) and it sometimes doesn't hit the mark in terms of flavour.  It's better to try dishes and share amongst friends than risk being stuck with a bland salad."}
{"text":"I am going to deduct a star on the second visit! how can you be out of the drink of the day at 8 PM. Luckily I was given a substitute drink without the mixer. Service hasn't improved much and is slow. Unfortunately the winter is here so waiting to get served can get tiring real fast as we are not on the gorgeous patio anymore. I ordered the chicken wings in chipotle sauce my partner in crime had a regular burger also note they don't have the 5$ off promo on appetizers anymore on Mondays. 
Then the server disappeared and we waited and waited till the food arrived.
I wouldn't notice the delay but the drink was watered down this time mainly with tons of ice. The place wasn't busy. Never mind on to the food the wings were slightly cold and sauce wasn't anything special. The burger was apparently good. With a bit of an odd location and sub par drinks and food one is hard pressed to recommend this place. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I have gone a few times to AtG - mainly for the patio because it is one of the best in the city.  

Location: Lots of space, good crowd, and right on the water.  Great people watching spot with sugar beach right next door.

Parking: I always park underground because i can get it redeemed but only on certain days (sorry, can't remember the guidelines but i think someone else on here mentioned it).  

Food: Is pretty good.  I have tried the wings, flat bread and salad.  I was really disappointed with breakfast on the weekend.  I had the breakfast bowl (toast, scrambled eggs, farmers sausage, something that they said was supposed to be bacon but definitely didn't look or taste like it, and grilled tomato).  The toast was dry, which was fine, but we were never asked or brought jelly, pb, butter...anything to put on it.  We were so hungry, we ate it dry.  The salt and pepper finally found its way to our table via our server halfway through our meal, and only after we asked for it.  We each ordered green tea and water - and got our drinks after five other tables around us arrived and had been sat.  

Service: as you can see from above, service was very slow.  painful. which is not only consistent with all the other times i have been there, but reading some of the other reviews, seems par for the course.  a lady did come around and ask how everything was but of course we had our mouths full when she asked and didn't see her again during our visit.

Overall: Go for the food and the patio, get stuck because of the slow service."}
{"text":"We popped in for a quick bite before the Yelp boat cruise event. What a disappointment.  

Considering it was their two year anniversary event, it wasn't very exciting at all.  How has this place stayed in business for two whole years???  

The live music was entertaining.  The sampling of wine, beer, and cider were very good.  The biggest miss was the food they served, both ordered dishes and complimentary ones as well!  

Kale salad with citrus and some shaved Parmesan was ok, but nothing I couldn't make myself.  $14 was pretty steep for such a basic salad.  The lobster tacos were very watery, leaving me to believe it was frozen lobster meat.  Oh, and the servers should know more about the dishes.  We were told there would be three tacos and there were only two.  Some of the complimentary appetizers were the calamari (so dry and chewy/rubbery), mushroom flatbread (soggy and extremely greasy), pork taco (soft taco shell was too thick and cold) and we had their version of the Toronto iced tea (instead of Long Island) and it was... alright.

The best thing about this place is the patio.  If you don't mind the awkward location, it's ok for a drink by the water.  The inside decor is nice too."}
{"text":"The service is substandard. Although the patio is fantastic, everything else about the restaurant is very poor. The waitresses had a carefree attitude about the seating queue, maintaining service at the table and all around basic restaurant service etiquette. The place gets a D- even with the nice view."}
{"text":"I dined at Against The Grain's Dockerside location during an oddly warm mid-October afternoon. I was pleasantly surprised to discover their patio was still open, allowing my date and I to enjoy the Toronto habour front. Other than the great view, everything else was mediocre. I had a disappointing $16 clubhouse sandwich and the layout of the patio is incredibly inconvenient. The tables are squished together, leaving little privacy and some of the chairs are blocked by umbrella stands, my date had to awkwardly step over one to get to her seat. If it wasn't for the limited number of options around this part of Toronto, I would not dine here again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for drinks with some friends and we were seated in their patio area. While the lakefront view is gorgeous, you can't see a thing in front of you. It's so dark you can't even read the menus. Maybe it's adds to ambiance, but using the light on my phone to look at my friends and read the menus is not something I particularly enjoyed.  I didn't have any of the food so can't comment on that. 

Please just get some soft lighting in the patio area."}
{"text":"I haven't had much luck with waterfront restaurants in Toronto. But Against the Grain was an exception.  First of all, the service was amazing. We sat outside right by the water and our server arrived promptly to offer us drinks. In fact, he was all over his section making sure that people had everything they needed. He did introduce himself by name, but I will confess that I don't remember. Either way, he was great.

We had the ginger margarita, which was not so great. For $30 for a pitcher it amounts to about a drink and a half and was a little too sweet. My boyfriend had the poutine and was pretty disappointed, but my mushroom flatbread pizza was the perfect nosh. I wished I'd had a nice chardonnay with it instead of the margarita, but that's my own fault for not drinking fast enough ;). 

Overall it was a great experience and I'd come back in a heartbeat. In fact,  after being burned at the Watermark by awful service and mediocre food, it's now my only choice for drinks on the waterfront!"}
{"text":"The view from the patio is really nice, and our waitress was friendly in spite of being run off her feet, but the food's only so-so (who can make a French fry that tough and tasteless?!) and the aesthetic is pretty corporate-meets-hotel-bar, possibly because of its location in the Corus building. 

The wait for the ideal waterfront bar continues!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. My friend and I waited for 30mins and no staff came by to take our order. The waitress finally came but afterwards it was impossible to get her attention. Customer sitting at another table had to help us to get her attention. The bill came really quick though lol... service was bad!!!"}
{"text":"Really great service, fantastic location,the food though, is more miss than hit. I was sorely disappointed when the wings came through over-fried and tough like leather. We had an oyster special on one visit that were decent, kind of Rockefeller style. Salty, with intense flavor, creamy and a yummy bread crumb topping. Other menu items we had were mediocore at best. While the presentations were nice to look at,  it just didn't quite come together where it counts: on my tongue.

The lakefront patio is a great visit for the relaxing view. The beer list is extensive with lots of more 'exotic' choices like $50+ bottles of beer from hidden European monasteries. 

If you don't have a car, or a random bike handy, it's currently difficult to get to on foot from the Queens Quay streetcar stop. There really isn't really a sidewalk on parts of the journey. Lots of overly made up people in killer heels or perfectly pressed suits. It's great for people watching."}
{"text":"Great venue. Great service. Great food. Ugh, in a word, \"great|\"?

If you're around the east end of the core or even farther east, you should check out Against the Grain. In a complete no-mans zone, AtG stands out like a gem.

They have a massive patio on the water that doesn't have the greatest view, but if you keep your eyes focused where there's only water, it's all good.

Service was great , especially for a new business. Our waitress was completely up to speed on the menu items, gave us a rundown on the daily specials (check 'em out) and a few other staff stopped by to see how things were going. 

We stopped in for brunch after seeing a menu posted online and weren't disappointed. One eggs benny w/ real hollandaise - yup. A massive bowl of breakfast goodness, including thick-cut, double-smoked bacon - yup. $3 Caesars - oh yeah. 

All the food was top-shelf, including some damn tasty pan-fried potatoes. And they have a daily poutine special.

I'm not saying I'm going to direct my mail there, but I'll be back enough times that I should consider it."}
{"text":"I never write restaurant reviews. I read them, but I don't write them.

So when I have a dining experience so horrible that it merits me going through the hassle of creating an account the write a review, it must be true that this was the singularly, most unenjoyable dinner experience I have had in a very long time. The food was horrible (more on that later), as was the service. Here are the main points of our evening that made it spectacularly terrible.

1) The service was absolutely horrible from the moment the male waiter came to our table. Of a semi large party (10 guests), myself and a friend had not had enough time to choose our meals. When we asked if he could take the next guest's order and come back to us, he glared at us, turned around, and without replying, scathingly asked the next person for their order. This was our first interaction with him.

2) When a friend of mine ordered only soup (he had already had dinner prior to coming, but came for this special event), the waiter asked him, \"not very hungry, are we?\", prompting an embarrassed pause from the entire table.

3) When the food finally came, the steak frites which I had ordered was comparatively 1.5 times smaller than the other two at our table, and was about 80% frites and 20% steak. It was really the absolutely smallest steak I had ever seen before in my life! It was the size of the steaks that are put on top of steak salads, if not smaller. This may have been due to the fact that it had been charred to the point of shrinking, as what I had requested to be medium rare came as well done- or even more cooked than that. 

4) My friend's order did not come in until everyone's appetizers and main courses were here. It turned out the waiter forgot to put in his order. My friend finally got his food when most of us had almost finished our meals; and not a single apology from the waiter. 

5) Our first refill of water had everyone's glass filled- except mine. I had to drink from a friend's glass as no amount of attempting to call our waiter over for more water was successful.

6) When everyone had finished their water, we had to flag down another waiter (once again, ours was nowhere in sight for a very long time), and request for more water, as well as glasses of water for those who never got one as they had ordered drinks from the menu, which were long finished. Our waiter grudgingly obliged, and once again, filled everyone's glasses but mine. Luckily a sympathetic friend of mine was able to get a hold of him to fill up my cup, which he did so without so much of an apology, or even a word said.

7) When our bills came, our waiter failed to pick up 2 of the checks. We had to run them to the cash register/billing table ourselves, as, once again, he was nowhere in sight.

8) The waiter failed to return with my change for the bill, although he returned with everyone else's. I had to, once again, run to the billing table and found my bill lying by itself on the counter, with all the money taken out of it. After all this horrible service, I don't understand how the waiter could have expected what would have been a 25% tip. After I requested for my change from another waiter (guess what?? Ours was not in sight at all again!), she found him and he begrudgingly, and once again without an apology whatsoever, gave me back my change. Unfortunately due to my good manners I tipped him, although I definitely don't think that he deserved a tip at all, on top of having to pay for a piece of terrible, dry, tiny steak. 


This was what happened at my horrific dining experience. It was my friend's birthday, and so I did not want to make a big scene. If this had been any other time, I would have definitely sent my food back, and requested to speak with the manager. 

The service, and food (or what little there was of it), was absolutely horrible. The restaurant itself was not busy at all to warrant such lack of attention. Nor am I a bad diner- I dine out regularly, and I am courteous, respectful, and have never experienced such horrible service before.

Do NOT come to this restaurant! I may sometimes forgive bad service for amazing food; however, repeatedly and unacknowledged bad service, with dried, charred steak the laughable (literally, my friends laughed when they saw it) size of half the palm of your hand is enough to warrant a 'get the hell out, and never come back'."}
{"text":"Misleading restaurant name! If you are a gluten free American then you know the gluten free brand name as the same and expect the restaurant to have to more gluten free options than it does. The gin drink we ordered lacked the flavor of the description. The table side guacamole was good but not worth the price. Also table side there meant you make it yourself not the server."}
{"text":"Good beer list, a waterfront patio, upscale pub food, what's not to like?

A few things, actually -- the burger I had wasn't quite as good as it sounded, although it was certainly a good burger. The food prices are on the steep side, and there was a jackhammer working next door in the under-construction zone.

But I can be very forgiving of a waterfront patio with good beer selection, so I'm still a fan."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch with the family on a warm and breezy summer day.  Patio seating is highly recommended as you can take in the waters as you enjoy your company.  Lobster roll with sweet potato fries settled down quite nicely...lobster a bit colder than I prefer my foods but went nicely with the toasted bun.  Fried chicken banh mi was a bit of a misnomer as it certainly was not the typical baguette the name would insinuate...husband felt a bit disappointed with it.  Service was attentive and prompt.  There's a nice green P parking lot out front so won't be an issue.  Finally got to see the infamous Sugar Beach!"}
{"text":"Sitting outside on the patio on a sunny day is absolutely a must. It's the best water-front patio experience I think I've had in the T-dot. 
We had a group of about 12 and ordered several drinks and appetizers to share and it was all delicious.
It's not cheap. but I was lucky to be treated, so we kind of splurged a lot :)
The poutine was delicious
The pizza was great
The Nachos with chicken was amazing

The drinks were great

The waiter was nice, too :)

I mean, it's not the best food ever, but they have a great cocktail menu and it's so awesome because of the excellent patio. 
Sooooo worth checking out and the bigger your party, the better."}
{"text":"I really want to love and support this place as it is close to me and the views are perfect.  They launched a new menu which is exciting as the food was so terrible previously.  (They changed it from when they first opened.) We were there for brunch and our food took an hour to arrive.  The servers looked overwhelmed and even the drink service suffered.  During our wait, many neighbouring tables were emptying as people were leaving since they have received neither food or drink.  The food when it came was good.  But the hour wait is not acceptable.  No one came over to talk to us and let us know what is happening with the food.  We did not get anything for waiting.  Restaurant is about logistics.  Be consistent.  I am sadly never going back here again.  I feel so bad as I may have told people about the new brunch menu but failed to realize the service is so slow.  If you come here maybe just order drinks and eat beforehand."}
{"text":"Slow service at the bar while waiting for table. No greeting, acknowledgment, or any kind of service for 7 minutes, until eventually I approached the bartender for service.

Quoted a twenty minute wait, actual wait was thirty.

Table service was very good - friendly, quick, and helpful. Turkey Club was quite good, especially the bread. Beef Rib special was very disappointing - extremely salty. Dessert options were limited, so we opted out.

Service - 3.5/5.0
Food - 2.5/5.0
Environment - 4/5
Overall - 3/5"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that has the potential to be great. When we walked in and sat down the music was so incredibly loud I couldn't even hear across the table. Everyone was bothered by the music and it made ordering awkward since it felt we were shooting out our orders. I ordered a medium rare steak and it was over done. The salad had no dressing or flavor. The service was slow and when we asked for condiments for our food the waitress never brought them out. There was one other family there so it's not like they were busy. We felt the food was very mediocre and completely over priced for the quality and service we received. Won't be going back. Its unfortunate because it has really lovely views of the lake."}
{"text":"A great exclusive location on the waterfront, a huge patio in a city that needs more huge waterfront patios, friendly staff, solid service -- what could go wrong? I have been here a number of times and it is a fine place to go for a beer if you are trapped at the Corus building. But having eaten here several times as well, the food is disappointing, and it's not just me being picky. My work colleagues came up with the same complaints. The food is industrial grade for the most part (with a couple minor exceptions). I don't know what's going on back in the kitchen but the results taste like no one cares.  

Maybe two stars is harsh, but with everything it has going for it, it's doubly annoying that Against The Grain doesn't get it right."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my mentor suggested this place by the Corus building and the waters. It has a beautiful patio with a view of the lake right across from it. Today was a beautiful afternoon and my mentor/ friend/ advisor decided to go for drinks and he suggested this place because he was intrigued by it as he can see it from his office on a daily basis. 

Upon entering the premises, we were greeted right away a super friendly wait staff. We got a table on the patio immediately, which is incredible because it was after work hours and we did not have reservations. They have a very diverse drink menu, the beer section even has my favourite: Mill Street Organic. But these days I drink harder stuff because I'm super stressed,  so I ordered Belvedere on rocks with limes on the side. 

I had a great early evening here and would most def come back. A nice hot summer evening, with good company, great conversations, attentive and happy wait staff,  great atmosphere with well behaved patrons, a perfect summer drink, looking at sailboats on the water... tres cool."}
{"text":"A small group of us came here to enjoy some beers on the patio now that it's warming up. When we got there we were put on waitlist for the patio despite being half full (short staffed I guess?). We were supposed to receive a text when a table was ready, however, we never got one, instead we were finally seated when one of us got up to ask 40 minutes later.

The food was considerably bland and over-priced. I was charged an extra $4 to substitute out the veggie patty for meat. The burger patty was fairly thin and overcooked, not at all fresh.

On the positives: our server was very friendly and the view of the lake was nice...

Come here for a nice view and some drinks, but don't bother with the food."}
{"text":"Great location on the water in Toronto, very sweet decor and setup. Had the lobster roll for lunch and it was unreal, very fresh and unique taste for a Toronto spot! The two gentleman running the bar were wonderful with suggestions and service was great. 
I'd recommend to anyone looking for a new spot to try out! Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Against the Grain has claim to one of my favourite patios in the city, right by the water, comfy chairs (not to mention great fireplaces), really poppin drinks, good food and staff at the top of their game make this a real treat to visit. 

My last trip here was dominated by sampling their drinks from their house made cocktail specials (a wonderfully refreshing lemonade with bourbon/whiskey) to a full on sampling of all their beers with a nice run through them from our server who is also their chief bartender and happened to be waiting tables that night due to a high load of customers. And we certainly did luck out because he was spectacular and gave us a full sampling of all 15 draft beers (5 of which he comp'd us for) and that certainly ensured we left here well inebriated.

I must mention the fancy fireplaces they have by some of the couches on the patio using glass as \"firewood\", certainly a cool effect that will give you looks of envy with people on \"normal\" tables that are light by a measly candle. 

It's right by the water and provides a nice post dinner/drinks strolling location especially with sugar beach right next to it. Overall a great and somewhat unique setting since most other waterfront locations are not as secluded as Against the Grain is. The problem of this seclusion is that it's not that accessible by TTC and could be a little tough to find, my advice is enter it from the water's side which should make life easier. 

Even if it's cold outside their interior has lots of room and nicely deco'd out, if you want to catch some sporting games the bar area is well stocked with TVs and they even have a good section at the back that doubles up as a private event space which I was able to check out thanks to a CMYE that was held here a while ago. 

I have not sampled enough of their menu to really comment on it, but this is certainly a location that provides a good quality meal, it is somewhat on the pricier side even on the drinks front but I'd say it's all worth it."}
{"text":"Last night,after my friends and I had fun go karting at Polson Pier, we wanted to have dinner, so I suggested this place. The restaurant is located inside the sleek Corus Quay building. As a side note, I'm told that public tours are conducted at the building, which I will definitely check out. 

There is a large patio overlooking the lake and you can comfortably sit on luxurious seats around a fire pit to keep warm on a chilly summer night. It's quite romantic, and I do think it would be a great place for date night. Inside, the restaurant is reminiscent of Milestones; it's large, open and airy, with high ceilings and the music playing moderately loud.

We ordered drinks and I had a lime daiquiri, which was just right; not too sweet or sour. I ordered the rose tagliatelle and I was hoping they had whole wheat pasta, but no dice. I also requested that grilled chicken be added to the dish and it was $5 more, for a total of $21 for the mediocre pasta dish. The chicken looked and tasted more like roasted chicken slices, than grilled chicken. The menu indicated that the dish comes with pine nuts, but I couldn't taste any in my meal. Cherry tomatoes were aplenty, as was the goat cheese. Portions are quite big here, so we didn't have any room for dessert. 

Service was just alright. The server didn't make any recommendations, but was cordial and polite. I might come back to try something else on the menu and to take in the  gorgeous view of the lake during the daytime.

Tips: Be sure to get a table on the patio during summer to get a great view of the lake! Free underground parking is also available."}
{"text":"Long wait for barely mediocre, over-priced food! Angus burger was dry and tasteless. Staff need to get their act together...a lot of confusion at this place!"}
{"text":"The draw for us was the outdoor seating.  It was a beautiful day and we enjoyed the sitting in the sun, the water view and the food.  We ordered a hamburger, some chicken wings, a couple of salads. The food was good but not outstanding.  The waitress was attentive, but seemed distracted. The water tasted a little \"off\" and none of use finished the glass.  When in Toronto again will probably go back, but mostly for the view."}
{"text":"Nice area with lots of outdoor seating. Good for groups of +5. I was with a group of 11 and it was good.  The food is descent. My salmon was overdone. The fish and chips were good.  The fries were not good

Great place to have drinks with a view with a group. Service is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"It's quite refreshing to walk to the lakeside, and into a design pleasing building after working in the office. We came here for the company holiday lunch, and I got so many compliments for picking this place!

I had come here before for a CYME and remembered looking at the tasty menu, making a mental note to come back. It's quite secluded and you wouldn't know it's here unless already told about it. Tucked away in the back of the Corus building, is this modern tavern. 

Food is modern pub fare and \"American/Canadian\" with some flare. The things that caught my eye was the from scratch Flat Beards, the Urban Burger (braised ox tail, beef patty and breaded onion ring - $18), The veal cheek Sheppard's pie (braised in Mill St Beer - $15), and the Lamb Shank ($18)

Everyone seemed to really enjoy their food, and the portions were both filling and satisfying. I went with the Veal Cheek - especially tender and very flavourful. The huge salad that came with it was tasty too. 

The only thing that seems amiss was that it did take a long time (at least 30 mins) for food to arrive. Good and sometimes awkward conversation with co-workers, but still a long time. We were there until about 2:00pm

Organizing the big group was easy. When you want to plan something with ATG as well as their sister restaurants like Mill St and Bar Vespa, you deal with FabConcepts who owns this, Mill St Brewery and some other neighbour pubs. They are always really friendly and gets back to me right away. 

When we got there, they already knew I had requested separate bills, and the server had set it up before hand. At the end, he very diligently printed out everything and gave it to us which was a really good treat. Especially with work people, it was much easier this way. 

Everyone really liked it, and hopefully felt the drive from Mississauga worth it (it's right off the highway!).  Be sure to show your boss the awesome Corus building slide!

Parking during weekdays are not validated (if you can even find a spot ($12)). $3 across the street (per hour) or Loblaws (free with purchase) is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Loved the patio. Brunch Benny was excellent. Good service. Best view/outlook in the city. This is now my go to place for out of town guests. Hope they have a winter menu."}
{"text":"Although the food is pretty good and the patio is great fun, the service for our group was truly terrible. We'd been seated for AN HOUR before we even got water, an hour and a half till drinks finally arrived and two hours till food hit the table. To be fair, the server who finally made things happen was great and doing the best she could, but it took a couple of tries to finally get someone who could get the job done. Too bad - there's a lot to like about this place."}
{"text":"Food was a \"1\", hard to mess up pizza, burgers, and calamari yet all were not great. Service is a solid 2, but the ambiance and view are nice. Maybe a good place for beer/wine but the food is overpriced and stale."}
{"text":"Wonderful lakeside restaurant with a gorgeous patio. It's in a much, MUCH less busy part of the waterfront--the busy stretch of Queen's Quay is quite a bit west of here. It's even peaceful enough on summer weekends when tourists pack in, because they're seldom this far east where there's not as much to see and do. This is a big plus of coming here compared to, say, Amsterdam's restaurant at Rees.

Food and drinks are amazing. Good beer, wine, and cocktails--sangrias are great on the patio by the lake. Sitting by the patio is wonderful, but you still get a good view inside if that's your preference. Great food--I love their poutine, for one; I often get a couple of appetizers instead of an entree since they have a lot of good stuff. Nice lunch stop if you order apps. Good service. Prices are a bit high, but not unreasonble.

Very easily accessible, any way you come; George Brown College, right next door, has a paid underground parking garage with electric vehicle charging stations. The TTC 6 Bay bus stops right in front of the building, and this lower-traffic part of Queen's Quay makes it a quick 5-10 minute ride to/from Union station. There's also the Martin Goodman bike train, separated entirely from the road, with bike parking nearby and a huge bikeshare toronto dock. Beautiful Sugar Beach park adjacent to the restaurant, and the amazing, modern Sherbourne Common park on the east side. Nice benches by the lake just outside the restaurant's patio."}
{"text":"I found this place when I was looking online for where to find the best patios in the city. Against the Grain surely deserves to be included in this list. Right on the waterfront with a beautiful breeze and the layout of the patio is so nice as well with couches as well as tables and chairs. Makes me wonder why anyone would bother to eat inside.

We went on a Tuesday when they have a special for $0.49 wings and $5 pints of Rolling Rock. The Maple BBQ wings were incredible and paying about $15 including tax and tip for a pint of great beer and a pound of delicious wings on a gorgeous patio is more than a little bit of a great deal!"}
{"text":"Despite some of the really rough reviews on here, I decided to recommend this place for lunch when a group of friends coming in from Mississauga wanted something on the water. We were all pleasantly surprised. All 7 of us were really happy with what we ordered, with a mixture of items coming off the brunch and regular lunch menus. I had the bacon-wrapped tenderloin salad and really enjoyed it - 2 nice pieces of tenderloin with a bed of mixed greens/romaine, almonds, onions and a nice strong blue cheese, would recommend it. 

Service was pretty decent. Our waiter accidentally tripped and soaked my friend with some beer, but he was superb otherwise and my friend was happy sacrificing her wet hair for a free lunch. 

Location is a little bit out of the way, but it is definitely worth being away from the tourist-traps that are closer to the Harbourfront centre and of course the views are great. 

Overall, I would have no problems going back here or recommending this place to someone looking for a nice experience on the waterfront."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located along Lake Ontario in the Corus Building on Queens Quay (near the Loblaws). Although it's not in the heart of the city, it is still easily accessible by TTC and fairly close to Union Station.

My husband and I wanted to eat here to try their Winterlicious lunch menu and I was very impressed on the design and layout of the restaurant. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was casual. There were cozy booths and comfy swivel chairs (which we had the pleasure of sitting on!) stationed throughout different tables of the restaurant. We were seated by the window overlooking the lake. We were also impressed by the really good music they played while we waited for the food. 

I ordered the fried oysters, all beef housemade bacon and cheese beef burger and cheesecake. The fried oysters were great! The spicy dipping sauce that it came with was amazing! I couldn't get enough of it. Although the appetizer was good I was a little disappointed by the quantity of oysters as I only got 2 but I guess that is what I should expect for $15 three course meal. The burger was the juiciest burger I've had in a long time. Topped with cheese and thick cut house cured bacon really made it a savoury, mouth watering lunch! The fries as well were fresh cut fries and also one of the best in the city. Not overly salty or soggy. It had the perfect amount of crispness after each bite. Dessert was a cheesecake with a berry compote. What a treat that was! Perfect in size and sweetness, this rich and creamy cake was a perfect end to an awesome meal.

The overall service was not slow at all. All staff especially our waitress were incredibly efficient and friendly! 

It was definitely worth the money. I would come back to try some food off their regular menu too!"}
{"text":"I don't get all the negative reviews for this place. My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new so we came here for the first time and quite enjoyed our time. 

We were seated outside in the patio immediately upon arrival; our server was very friendly, knowledgable about the menu, and attentive to our needs. 

I really love that the patio is located right in front of the lake which gives this place the perfect atmosphere while dinning. It's a good vibe for big groups as well as intimate dates.

As for the food, we got fish tacos to start off which I thought were delicious besides it's tiny portion size. I had the nachos which were really good! The only negative to the nachos I would say is that it doesn't come with salsa because there's a pico de gallo \"salsa\" on the nachos already (which literally just looked like chopped up tomatoes). My boyfriend got the hamburger and fries which was mediocre, nothing special or different about it. 

To drink I got the watermelon mojito which was to die for! I actually had two because they were so delicious. My boyfriend is more of a Guinness drinker and he was recommended to try a Stout which was the only one on the menu -- he enjoyed it and had two of them as well. The beer actually had a coffee taste to it which was different. 

Warning that the menu is very limited so there's not much selection to choose from at all.

I'd definitely come back here have a relaxing time drinking some watermelon mojitos and to take in the beautiful scenery."}
{"text":"Ambiance was decent. Typical \"trendy\" TO rest tho.
Food was good. 
Service was HORRIBLE! Waited, and waited for the server to come to our table (A good 15 minutes). Drinks took way too long to arrive. Food service was quick however, but the Server didn't check on us after we got our meals. And he took too long to bring us our second round of drinks.
There are much better patios with better service in this city. If it wasn't for the food, Against the Grain would be getting a big fat F from me!"}
{"text":"Went over on a beautiful November Saturday morning with a group of 7.  All of us a ordered different things and all of us were happy with our dishes.  The kitchen burned by first Blanco pizza so I had to wait while the rest of the table dug in.  However, I appreciate them not sending something out they recognized as sub-par, AND, they apologized by giving me my second Ceasar on the house.

When I did get my pizza, it was fantastic.  All in all, a very delicious and positive experience.  Will return."}
{"text":"Not amazing food, but decent for bar type food. Would visit again for the $10 free parking which they take off your bill total and the awesome view and calm."}
{"text":"Been here many times for dinner and snacks.  Finally made it for brunch today.   They actually changed the time from 2pm to 4pm which is great for late weekend risers (like me).

Quality of the food is typically high quality.  Fresh greens and my favourite eggs Benedict is prepared perfectly!  The Hash brown nuggets is great - not greasy at all and crunchy.   

Add in the typical good service and you have a must try place when you are at Queens Quay."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences in years. Place was half empty with plenty of servers standing around chatting. Took an hour for our party to place the food order. Food wait wasn't as bad , about 30 mins. Waited over an hour to get the bill. Brunch took 3 hours! The food is meh. Nothing on the menu if you don't eat meat, dairy. This was a brunch for mothers day so no option but to go. I ordered the hippie salad and had to hold the cheese. It was basically a plate of radichio with some thinly sliced apple for $15. Don't waste your time eating here!"}
{"text":"Long story short - their hostess/table allocation system is a mess. We waited for 40 minutes while tables sat empty. Not one table - 6 to 10 tables at a time. Outside of that, great place. But was nearly impossible to get seated."}
{"text":"Enjoyable! Came on a Friday and got a table on the patio overlooking the lake which is absolutely beautiful, especially watching the sailing clubs' many boats coast along the waterfront towards the city and back to the islands. 

We settled in and ordered a pint from their 6 rotating craft beer taps and began looking over the menu. Most pints were around $6.50-$7.50 which is standard nowadays so no complaints there.
Overall the menu seemed rather hit and miss which is really my only fault in the place.  No chicken items on the menu, some questionably priced items ($16 flatbreads and salads), and I found it especially odd you could order pulled pork on the nachos but they don't have a pulled pork sandwich. The menu itself didn't have a whole lot that spoke out to me so I settled on the ATG Burger. I will admit that it easily falls in the Top 5 burgers I've had in the city, although at $19 it is also one of the pricier burgers to make that list. 

Our waitress was awesome, she was attentive but also engaging in being able to make recommendations and even cracked a few jokes. Haven't had a server that impressed me this much since Canoe which is naturally a whole different level of expectations. Good experience on the whole, will definitely come back for some more patio pints at the least."}
{"text":"Mark my words, this WILL be my Summer patio.
Ample (comfortable) seating on the waterfront,Daily Poutine specials, outdoor hot tables, friendly knowledgeable staff (and they have only been open a week, so other resto's you'd bettah recognize yo!) and a tasty and diverse menu makes this place a winner winner chicken dinner!
The patio is a stonesthrow away from Sugar Beach in the shiny new Corus building (which might I add, is super fun to explore after a few wobbly pops).  The atmosphere is so great you barely notice the construction going on next door.
And the food, toats mcgoats one and a half thumbs up.  I went w/ my secret lunch club and we ordered the duck tacos (amazeballs), Chipotle Maple wings (big and juicy), Sweet potato fries (yum) and the Nachos (not the best nachos but decent enough) and were so  impressed we made reservation for next week.  Finally a kick ass option to the Quay's other lame pub Watermark for those of us sentenced to work/life on the Quay."}
{"text":"I love this place from the day it opened. The patio is awesome and by the water... Their menú has changed quite a bit. I used to love the buck-a-bone nights... Great place still and the service is wonderful."}
{"text":"Food was ok and service merely passable. Ordered cocktail and before we could finish half of that, food arrived, told waitress tgat we would need a drink with dinner and she never came by before dinner arrived. Flagged her down for a glass of wine and a beer and ended up canceling those because they hadn't arrived by the time we had finished our food. Menu has intrigue but the bar and the kitchen need much better pacing. Won't come back."}
{"text":"Very beautiful view of the Lake Ontario at the patio. Comfortable couch and good for intimate seating arrangement.

We ordered Tuna Tartarte which is absolutely amazing. The chips had a very delicate fried smell. The smoked ribs I ordered had a sauce a bit too strong but the meat is fantastic, with a tight texture and rich taste of smoke. 

They have a wide selection of beer and liquors with incredibly different collection of wine, whisky, vodka, gin and brandy. However, their brand cocktail - Against the smashed grain was overly sour and I found it uncomfortable.

Dessert menu needs to be improved as there were only 5 items. Chocolate Pudding was a good one.

Service is very good. Our waitress is very patient and kind."}
{"text":"I would like to be able to tout this place because I like that it is on the waterfront, in a city thirsting for waterfront development.  Problem is, they do a fairly shit job consistently.  The food here is mediocre (which is understandable if it's a pub) and the drinks are overpriced (which is understandable if it's a restaurant)...see where I'm going here.  My wife got a glass of wine, cheapest on the menu, 9oz for $18.  We got into a fight and I told her never to do that again.

The fish tacos were very fishy, not so flavorful and a leaky wet mess.

The flatbread tasted good, but not any bit better than a McCain frozen pizza.

My sandwich was nice.  It was a club with bacon and chicken.  I'll give them that.

The service overall is a little inconsistent.  I've been here 3 times now (2 for brunch and once for dinner).  2 times it was super slow (brunch) for dinner it was super fast...except that twice while we were seated a server dropped a glass and it shattered - like I said, this happened twice, over the course of a one hour meal.

Finally, and I know this is a bit mean and sort of discredits everything I've written above...if the above had any credit to begin with...but I found the servers, hosts and staff generally to be very unattractive and unkempt.  This affected my appetite slightly, which I guess based on the foregoing is not a terrible thing."}
{"text":"I went here after a day long of festivities on Ward's Island.  We were a group of 20 on the patio.  Let's just say my review will mirror a few of my other yelpers when they said the service was crap! They didn't know where any of the food belonged to, they were just guessing a section then asking us who ordered the food.  Sorry, I don't keep track of 20 people's orders, you do.  Next 2 other guys joined us later and were not asked what they wanted to order for 20 mins.  We asked them twice to take their order.  The food came and I found it good but the terrible service from the male server (skinny one) just put a sour taste in my mouth.  I totally forgot that the server was rude at times too. Now get this, I ordered dessert...5...10...20...25 I lost track by then but nothing came out. I went for a smoke lol and my friend told me he reminded them about it and the server said he would check.  I saw him inside and asked him about it and he said he had no idea like he was surprised.  Cancelled that dessert.  There were so many more issues I had with this placed but I think you get the point. I agree there needs to be a change cause that is a prime spot thats being wasted.

Update: friend told me he got food poisoning!

YIKES!"}
{"text":"It's a nice enough place and I've been twice now; both times on the company's dime. And while I'm sure I'll end up going back (my boss seems to really like it) I'm not so sure I'd head back if I had to shell out for it myself.

First off for a place with a name like \"Against the Grain Urban Tavern\" there are shockingly few vegetarian options. I think that's one of the reasons he chose it in the first place, in an attempt to cater to myself and the one other vegetarian in our workplace. Sadly of all the burgers, flatbreads and entrees the only thing I can eat is the Artichoke Flatbread. It's tasty enough but not spectacular and at $16.00 neither filling nor delicious enough to justify the price. Other than that, I'm pretty much stuck with salads or appetizers which is pretty disappointing. I wouldn't mind as much if the nachos were more than just average (and again, pretty expensive) or if the perogies (where I have to ask for no kielbasa or bacon) were a little more substantial. The Garden Tacos weren't even an option for me...mushrooms in the taco? Yuck! The next time I'm there for a workplace function I'm either going to have to grab a snack beforehand or brace myself for leaving only half full!

The big selling feature of this place surely has to be the very neat patio which has a great view of Ward's Island...it's pretty neat and I guess slightly justifies the somewhat inflated prices. Sadly both times I've been were in the winter months so we could only look through the glass. Still, it's a neat locale and almost makes me forget about the rather nasty Redpath Sugar Factory chugging along next door. The list of beers on tap is pretty nice and the rotational taps are always appreciated by someone like me who always likes to try something new or seasonal. The service was perfectly pleasant and attentive.

So Against the Grain is a tough call for me. Even though I think it's a TAD overpriced, I guess I'm going to have to give them a borderline recommendation based on the beers, the view and the fact that my co-workers all seemed to rather enjoy it. But as a vegetarian, there isn't much reason for me to patronize it on my own. You're a neat place, ATG and I do want to come back...just add a veggie burger, a pasta dish, SOMETHING that constitutes a full vegetarian meal! Oh and see what you can do about convincing the sugar factory to fold up shop. Okay, that last one probably ain't gonna happen."}
{"text":"My party of five had a reservation and we were initially seated at a table for four, with one chair added to the end of the table, where one member of our party kept getting knocked by wait staff. We asked our server to be re-seated and was informed that the rest of the tables were already reserved; yet, we saw a round table of five where only two people were seated the entire time they were there. Eventually, we spoke with the manager and he re-seated us to a much more comfortable spot. It just felt like our particular server was more interested in doing what was most convenient for her, which was disappointing, since we did purchase multiple drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts, and we tip generously. Very grateful to the manager for his kindness and graciousness, but wished our server had some of his compassion.

Food and atmosphere were both lovely. Service left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Might be one of the best patios in Toronto. Fantastic location, especially in the summertime. Service was friendly, but not super fast. Food was pretty good. The home fries were great. Good for kids (outside) except the kids meals were kind of pricey in comparison to other. ($12). But it is now one of my favourite patios in the city!!"}
{"text":"We've had our annual company party here a few times. I love the location, right next to the water. Staff is always friendly and accommodating. We usually organize a set menu in advance, but always have one specific person that might need a special order. Staff is very attentive to refills and ensuring special orders are fulfilled. So far my favorite thing has been the Grilled Flat Iron Steak. The menu says that it is served with spicy ketchup. I didn't think it was spicy... maybe a little bit more than regular. I haven't loved the dessert selection, but usually, the only items on our set menu are chocolate based and I'm not a fan. Everyone else seems to really enjoy it though. In my opinion the set menu should offer two different types of dessert."}
{"text":"This is possibly the worst restaurant yet!!! 
Me and 5 of my friends went here for lunch today and as we walked in it was empty and the patio was only half full and the had a full staff so tell me why is took 20min for our witress to come over to us!!!!, so we get our appetizers and the chicken wings are dried and hard and the nachos flavorless.. but wait the dishes that where given to eat our appetizer on where dirty and the middle plate had food on it... so on to the main meal 40min later we get the mains and the poutine was cold and cheese was hard, salad had no dressing and when I asked for extra they charged me... the mac and cheese that's the house special was flavorless.... I read some good reviews about this place but it's probably the employees posting them.... PEOPLE please don't waste ur money not worth it on bit.... and then ly reason  I gave this place a 1 stare is cause the view was nice"}
{"text":"THE GENESIS OF TORONTO'S WATERFRONT REVIVAL!

ATG is an extremely welcome addition to Toronto's Eastern (non-beaches) Waterfront. Nestled on the south side of the Corus building, Against The Grain delivers killer cocktails, unique beers, decadent menu options and breezy, west coast feel and decor. The patio is clean and upscale with plenty of tables by the water, while the interior is blessed by great natural light with cozy, comfortable booths and seats.

Chef Sera Antheunis has definitely crafted this menu Against The Grain to appeal to one's savoury, daring tastes. The charcuterie board with house-made beer bread is a great way for a group to whet their appetites, the house-made pulled pork tacos quite simply melt in your mouth, while her selection of unique salads (e.g. Glazed & Confused- w/ frambozen-glazed duck breast) present the customer with eclectic, tantalizing choices to make. 

For the main course, I rolled the dice and tried the Beer Braised Short Rib Burger. Oh my stars it did not disappoint! It's best to cut it in half to keep it intact because it is piled high with a succulent grilled burger, blue cheese, bacon and the piece de resistance, actual braised short rib meat on top... YURM. Best burger I've had in years! Our party's only complaint was too much rosemary on the Dockside Pizza, but it was still quite delicious..

Don't be frightened away thinking the menu features only exotic flavour pairings--  ATG makes some of the best pub chicken wings I've ever tasted. (HINT: Tuesdays = 49cent wing night). They offer a deal of the day each day of the week that can get you some cheap beers and/or unique menu options not normally available on the menu (Saturday = BABY BACK RIB day).

I'm also very impressed by the mixology employed in ATG's cocktail list. They'll mix you a proper Sidecar for $12, as well as uber-fresh mojitos and margaritas, and they do not skimp out on the booze. The Against The Grain signature cocktail is my fave; nice and strong, whisky-based tastiness. 

The staff and managers know their stuff and your experience is sure to be a positive one. It's very refreshing to see a great new menu like this one on Toronto's Waterfront. Viva the Urban Tavern!"}
{"text":"I had the Wednesday special, beef ribs... They were terribly salty. I got food poisoning after :( Service was good though."}
{"text":"Love the food not the service, first time here we had a reservation, place was half empty, we had a friend with a broken leg and they made us wait.
Got our table and the waiter was very nice but we waited a while for our food and coffee, aparently they were short staffed in the kitchen too.
We were staring at several dirty tables the whole time we were there.
We asked to speak to the manager, she said a lot of people call in sick and apologized for the experience.
Guys I know it is not ur fault if people call in sick but it is the weekend.
Not a good first impression and really doesnt make me want to go there again."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend if you're looking for a water front patio. Good selection of drinks and snacks. Great service.

-white sangria over red sangria  (red was too sweet)
-variety of gin and tonics

Recommended food
-smoked trout and chips dip
-calamari
-angry bee flatbread

I'd definitely come here on a nice sunny breezy day. After some snacks and drink you can walk over to sugar beach for some relaxation. 

Oh and they have green p parking at the front of the corus building."}
{"text":"The place boasts lakeside view and few crowds. It is in the Corus Building, faraway from the crowds in Harbourfront. That is a trait in its favour.

But the food....

I was disappointed with the Indonesian fried rice. It came burnt and cool! Burnt rice and burnt pieces of scrambled egg. It was hard to eat it."}
{"text":"Nice patio right at the water. Was walking along by sugar beach and decided to stop

We had the Tavern Salad and the Beet Root salad and they are both quite refreshing. The beet root had these tasty picked onions! I didn't like my dried beans in my salad as they were super crunchy (like realy hard to chew). Both had the right portion of cheese and dressing. Would recommend. 

I tried the berry mule drink and I was great. Wud order it again."}
{"text":"Against the Grain Urban Tavern around 7:00 PM on Saturday, June 25,2011

Had a nice time with friends. The weather held so we sat on the patio overlooking the Lake (behind the Chorus bldg). Restaurant has only been open 3 weeks, the service was therefore a bit sloppy.  But everyone was friendly!
Menu is not large, but it had some decent things on it, even Salmon Curry! I had pulled pork tacos and a large mixed green salad with heirloom tomatoes and beets.  The salad lacked a dressing and could be taken as bland, but I enjoyed it nonetheless (less calories!).  
They also have comfy sofa seating with fire pits - fun!
It was really nice walking along the waterfront and seeing the city lights. :)"}
{"text":"Originally, when my husband and I looked at this menu, with the great selections available, we intended to stay awhile.  After the crummy service, the bar extremely backed up, we ended up bailing after one drink.  We hoped to have a second drink with our meal, but couldn't get our server, and after she put in an order for a wine and an ale, it took so long we finished our meal and canceled the order.  Too bad for them."}
{"text":"The best Patio in Toronto and a terrific wait staff - too bad about the food.

I was here on what may be busiest Saturday Night in Toronto, and there were certainly high points and low points- and pints somewhere in the middle. 
Let's start with the bad news
The Lows:
- The Food! We were a party of five, and the waiter recommended the mussels in red Thai curry, which were delicious. I got a really decent fish and chips ( although I'm alway hoping for British-style chips as opposed to fries). My friend got the Thai Curry salmon, which came swimming in broth and is overwhelming for the fish, the dockside pizza was unremarkable. Most disappointing of all was my husbands angus burger, which had the consistency of shoe leather.

The Okays:
- the cocktails- my friend was smart and stuck with the classics- cosmos, white ladies- and they were delicious. However, the much hyped AGT signature cocktail was little more then a whiskey sour with thyme, and the summer sipper was underwhelming, it was good, just... Kinda boring. 

The HIGHs....
With all that being said, ATG has an amazing patio, fabulous beer list such an amazing waitstaff. I can't think of another place I'd rather be for a pint on a summer's evening. I had made reservations with the understanding that a patio seat may not be available, and one wasnt when I first arrived. However, the front of house staff quickly located me a table as we went for a drink or two at the bar. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and alplogetic when 3 of our party hated their food....

I would absolutely go back for drinks, but some improvements need to be made to call it a true gastropub!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was great. Nice view, friendly staff, good decor. 
The food was average and didn't have that great of a selection. The short rib burger was quite good, and so were the sweet potato fries. The caeser salad was average and was nothing special. The mussels were a bit bland, but the soup that it came with was very tasty and goes great with the bread that accompanies it. The dessert was amazing. Toblerone mousse is a must have!"}
{"text":"The view from the patio is amazing and calm. It is away from the busy flow of people at harbour front and it is right by the lake. 
Their patio is very big comparable to other places and the vibe was amazing. 
We ordered the poutine and the super salad. 
They were both very delicious. The salad had popcorn in it(yes, I was very surprised), avocados(my fav), goji berries amongst other more delicious things! 
The service was great, very attentive."}
{"text":"Wonderful location with a great view.

But then onto the other aspects of the experience... The menu actually offers some fresh ideas. Nothing necessarily innovative, but with the times. Their execution, however, was below average. First, as a restaurant that brands itself as Canadian, you need to work on your poutine, or get the right ingredients at the very least. Chicken was dry; pretzel was dry; flatbread was dry; veggie patty was dry. And frankly, presentation was very clunky even for a casual place.

Don't really know how the kitchen is managed... but if they would only properly execute what their menu has to offer, this might actually be a place worth revisiting."}
{"text":"New student at GBC. Recommended by my prof to check this place out at least once while we're studying here. Came here with some classmates after our midterm on Friday. Nice large patio facing the waters. Sometimes you get blessed with the musky lake scent. Came for lunch - not a lot of wait staff but a lot of tables - so we were kind of waiting to get our bills.

I was unimpressed by the menu. Nothing really popped out. $20 for burgers. Just your usual caucasian food fare...fish and chips etc. I ordered two appetizers instead since the items on that list seemed a little bit more tasteful. Ordered the beef tartare and braised cheek tacos and a passion fruit tom collins. Beef tartare was actually delicious, savoury asian flavours. Tacos were alright - kind of bland - needs some sort of sauce to add some kick to it. My two appies and my drink with tax and tip came up to just under $40 for lunch. Kind of on the expensive side for mediocre food. 

Overall, would not return here again."}
{"text":"(posted on behalf of my dad who is a non-yelper)

A friend and I had a superb dining experience yesterday at \"Against the Grain\" on Dockside in Toronto.  This restaurant is located on the shore of Lake Ontario near the foot of Jarvis St.  As we approached the entrance we were greeted very warmly by a hostess who told us she was just going to sit another party and she would be right back, but within a seconds another equally friendly hostess led us to a table on the patio.  She asked us if we would like sun or shade and since one of us wanted sun she lead us to a table which had a bit of each.

Our server, (Bayly), arrived very promptly to take our order and had a number of useful suggestions about the offerings.  A second server brought us our drinks and a third server brought us our coffees.  All of these servers were warm and friendly and seemed very concerned that everything was just perfect.  I had the fish in a bag and my companion had a flat bread dish of some sort.  She gave me a corner of hers, (mine wasn't very sharable), and, although it was something I wouldn't usually order, it was delicious.  My fish in a bag was also very tasty and fresh.  

The entire experience was delightful from beginning to end.  The weather was perfect, the setting was beautiful, the meals were delicious, (and as an added bonus they gave us cookies with the coffee).  I will definitely be returning to this restaurant - in fact, I already have arrangements for another visit."}
{"text":"After a hot and beautiful day of Volleyball at Woodbine Beach. We needed to find a patio. Against the Grain was the destination. When we got there the patio was on a wait. For a pretty good reason too, the view was amazing. Once we got in the patio we had to order pitchers of beer. We got pitchers of Mill St Tank House Ale and Mill St Organic Lager. I ordered the ATG Road House - Confit Chicken, Smoked Pork Loin, Tomato Preserve, Lettuce, Basil Mayo, on a Ciabatta Bun. It was a pretty good sandwich but a little on the small in terms of portion size. 

After the meal, drinks were still flowing. We drank and drank and the OPA! There was an accident and a glass pint of beer tipped over and broke. Our waitress was really great about it and gave us another pint to replace the one that tipped over. I also cut myself in the process and the Manager personally came outside to the patio and brought out band aids for me. He had a pretty good sense of humour thinking I was gonna wear a Hello Kitty band aid or a Dora the Explorer band aid. I tell you that customer service really impacts how you view the business as a whole. They have my vote for 5 stars just on the service we were given. I would recommend to go to Against the Grain on a beautiful day and enjoy their patio. I know I will. Until next time, Jimstar Out!!"}
{"text":"Against the Grain is a typical highly contrived, modern franchise-like designed, upper middle-class restaurant. 

The menu is filled with plenty of people pleaser's, which made it a good option when I was with a group of unadventurous eaters. Though the only real draw for this place is the location on the new Sugar Beach. I don't find myself wanting to go back.

Also, it appears the staff are all young and inexperienced. There was a long wait before our service started, while the first waiter decided to finish the shift and pass us along to someone else. Finally our waiter was actually really nice, but some of the people I was with (note, inexperienced diners) were disappointed with her performance. I tend to be a little more forgiving."}
{"text":"Monday late afternoon and it was way busier than I thought. It was a beautiful sunny day so the wait and busyness was outside. I would say there were hardly anyone inside, while everyone opted outside. It's a great view to enjoy with some company.

We were there just to grab some beer. The flight was okay, nothing stood out for me. Pretzel was pretty good though."}
{"text":"I dined here last night. When I walked in the hostess was friendly and helpful informing me she'd be right back after she sat a patron who arrived a few minutes before us. That was the highlight of the night. It took 20 min for our drink order to be taken. Another 20 minutes for our dinner order. I ordered the steak medium rare. It arrived well done. I was hungry so I opted to eat it. I pointed it out to our waiter. He came back and said I wouldn't have to pay for the steak. That was unexpected but a nice gesture. 

My friend ordered the Cornish hen. The portion was extremely small for a 26$ plate though it was cooked decently. 

All in all a 3/5"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for a festival in the area, I would never wander into this restaurant that is way out of the downtown core. It is attached to the CORUS building facing the water, so the patio out front would be a perfect place to enjoy the summer days.  Unfortunately, I came during a festival while it was raining so the building was packed with wet grumpy people and the patio was closed. Nonetheless, the staff did a great job controlling the crowds, and after a wait we were seated inside despite the volume of people.

I was looking for something hot and comforting, so the carrot tangine was the award winning pick of the day (which is an unexpected item to be on a generally pub menu). The carrot stew was excellent, slightly sweet but with many layers of textures. It was absolutely delicious, warming and filling without being too heavy. Extra star for this dish alone."}
{"text":"Y'know, this place could be OK except for the food and the waitress' minimalist service.

Split ceviche fish tacos as a starter. These are pretty good, albeit pricey at $13 for 3 tacos. Then my burger came. It was dry. Really dry. The bun was juicier than the burger. To reinforce how dry it was, a little chunk of bone was included for comparison. The $2 slice of cheese didn't do much to alleviate the dryness. I'd have told my waitress this if she bothered to come over and ask how our food was, but she didn't. She did the bare minimum of waitressing: she took our order, asked if I wanted a drink refill as she cleared my plate after I finished eating (I needed the whole glass to choke down the dry burger), asked if we wanted dessert, then brought the check. Other than that, she didn't swing by our corner much, if at all."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on a beautiful setting on the waterfront.  The patio is quite lovely, but can get a bit chilly in the evening.  The restaurant provides blankets, which is a nice touch.  Our party moved inside, which also had large windows with a water view.  The food is quite tasty and reasonably priced.  Highly recommended, especially for the great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It was probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to. Sure the patio was open, but the service was just down right poor. It started off with a simple task for our waitress. I ordered beer and water with lemon but only the water came without a lemon. I asked 4 different waiters and waitress until I recieved one.  (one being the manager). The beer didn't arrive because they were out so our waitress didn't have the sense to inform us.  I received a beer 20 mins after being seated. I ordered their famous burger which is priced at $20 and can definitely say I've taste better burgers and sandwiches that cost way less than that. In the end this is a terrible place to eat other than getting sun on the patio. Spend your money else where. Even the manager won't care about you."}
{"text":"Found the place while walking around the area. Went there on a Wednesday evening and had to wait at the bar for around half an hour before we got a table for 2. Service was good, the hostess and waitress were all smiles and nice. We ordered a Caesar salad with chicken topping (the chicken we could have done without) and the chicken fajita flatbread to share. They both tasted pretty good and we didn't wait long for the food to arrive. But it did take a while to get the bill, then get the machine to pay but that's ok cause we were enjoying the spectacular view and good atmosphere of the place. Location is the place's highlight. Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"This place seriously needs to review their service and policies. On a beautiful sunny Sunday afternoon, the patio is 50% full, and our party of 2 is told by the hostess that the wait for a table on the patio is over an hour. We ask why, as there are so many empty tables, and she indicates that since the kitchen is very backed up (as I said the patio is 50% full, and there is almost no one sitting inside...). She indicates that they are seating tables every 10 minutes or so, so as to avoid a long wait for food once seated. I ask her if we could sit on the patio if we didn't order any food (i.e. drinks only), and she indicates that no, there are 13 tables waiting in line in front of us for the half-empty patio... This makes no sense to me. First of all - why is the kitchen so backed up when the place is 1/4 full? Second of all - why can't you seat people to have drinks if they aren't ordering food? The saddest part - this isn't the first time I've had service issues there. The food is nothing to write home about, and the nice patio alone is not worth the hassle. This place has definitely lost my business for good."}
{"text":"Food was average and service was good. Not bad place to have a pint and eat if you're in the immediate area. Otherwise it's kind of in the middle of nowhere. Excellent in the summer when the patio is open."}
{"text":"Went to Against the Grain a couple of weeks ago and was pretty impressed overall.  We were rushed arriving due to crazy traffic so we were a bit frazzled about parking/where to park.

Super friendly & knowledgeable server (Mary) who made us feel very welcome and at ease.  I made our reservation for 7:00 pm on a Saturday night through Opentable.  The weather turned out to be amazing.  I didn't specify online if I would like indoor or outdoor (I didn't know you could?).  I figured with the beautiful evening, that the restaurant would be jammed and we would be stuck indoors.  The really nice hostesses at the door asked \"inside or outdoors\" when we arrived!  Yay!  We ended up at a prime table on the patio, overlooking the water (bonus!!!).  It is a beautiful spot, watching boats on the lake.  We had the bonus of the Super Moon which was cool.  We also noticed a boat pull up and get take out which was kind of funny!

Our server was very helpful with picking our drinks and dinner.  My husband had the mussels as an appetizer.  They were definitely NOT worth the $14 or so.  They were miniscule mussels and they looked shriveled up.  For our mains, we had the daily special fish & salad and the steak & frites - both were great.  Prices are a little high but the atmosphere definitely makes you forget about how much you are spending.  Overall, I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"You really can't lure in people with #pokemongo when the service is terrible and the food is mediocre and flavorless. I mean sure the upscale decor, fancy interior paired up nice waterfront view is great but you guys should get a huge F in customer service. My reservation for group of 10 was at 6:30 pm. I arrived with two friends at 6:24 pm. At that moment I was told they are clearing up the table for us and we would be seated very shortly. About 30 mins goes by, 2 more friends show up. I go back to inquire and I am told they are clearing up my table and would be seated very soon. Hmm wasn't I told that 30 mins ago? Either they don't know how to clean up a table or blatantly lied to me.  Let's not forget there were groups who walked in after me, without reservations and were seated right way. 3 more of my friends show up, which totals to 8 people including me. We see a group of 8 girls come in at 715 pm and they wait for few mins and they are seated right away.

At this point, I walk up to the host YET AGAIN to inquire how my reservation was at 630 pm and it is now 730 pm and we are STILL NOT SEATED!!! Yet the group that arrives an hour later with same number of people gets to sit before us. So what do I hear!? Oh there is a group leaving now and we are clearing your table. Seriously LMAO WTF!? An hour later you are still clearing a table for me . When I questioned the hostess again why the groups that came later and went ahead before us, she went red and had no answers for me. Ugh! 

After an eternity of cleaning our tables we are all seated. As for the food, it was flavorless. My friend's fried chicken burger tasted cold/frozen. We were served appetizer without plates which I had to ask for. Got served pitchers of beer without the glass which we also had to ask for. The drinks werent so bad, again mediocre.  The servers were nice but the poor management and negligency is why none of us will go back. And I definitely DO NOT recommend this place to anyone. Ugh #Bye"}
{"text":"The previous reviews had me totally prepared to dislike this place, but I thought it was great.

The bathroom was immaculate (I do think bathroom cleanliness speaks volumes about a restaurant), the service was prompt and courteous, and my iced tea was always replaced with a new one before I could get to the bottom of the glass. I know this irritates some people, but to me I think it shows that the server is attentive and takes the initiative to fill a need without having to be asked. 

I ordered the chicken tacos from the \"share worthy\" menu. They looked very nice and tasted good, but I think $12 for two tacos is questionable. The server did warn me that there were only two tacos in the order (this isn't listed on the menu) and gave me the option to order an additional taco, which I thought was a nice touch. The three people I was dining with ordered regular entree-sized items and they seemed like a much better value for the price."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome, food is mediocre. Typical bar/pub food, priced a little too high. Patio is great and service is friendly. Try the Waterloo Radler!"}
{"text":"Great spot near the lake!

Against The Grain is located on the main floor of the Corus Entertainment building. It has a nice patio near the water and a great bar and interior. The service is prompt and friendly and the menu very interesting.

The theme of this restaurant is the use of local organic ingredients to prepare some interesting dishes like Braised Farm Raised Veal Ossobucco and Maple Brind Ontario Chop. They have a selection of reasonably priced appetizers and the Roasted Tomato soup was excellent. The entrees are a little pricey however the preparation setting and service make it worth it. 

The Kobe Beef burger underwhelmed and the regular burger at $7 cheaper would probably have been as good. The egg bun used for the burger made it difficult to eat and keep everythig together, however the taste was good. This would be another place that would be great for drinks and appetizers first as it seems you require some knowledge of this place before you know exactly what to order for a full lunch or dinner.

Aside from the people working in the building, this spot is still relatively unknown in a quiet area west of the Docks."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to head on down to Toronto's Sugar Beach for the afternoon on Saturday.  After our visit there we were looking for a close place to have some lunch and sit on the patio.  We walked about 2 min from Sugar Beach and located in the Corus Entertainment building beside the beach we found \"Against the Grain Urban Tavern\".

Location:
If your downtown, then parking is always an issue.  We parked at the Loblaws across the street for $10 bucks, but I was reading a tip that if you park at the Corus Building and you dine at Against the Grain Urban Tavern, you will get the cost of your parking taken off your bill ($10 dollars). The actual location faces Lake Ontario, and with ample patio space (30-40 tables plus lounge seating) and sufficent indoor seating this location is prime for those looking for a summer patio experience

Service:
Excellent, looks like a ton of staff. Our server came within 2 min, drink orders within 2 min, explanation of menu items, apps in 10 min, refills, prebussing, food runners, table checks, quick bill delivery.  I can't say anything bad about the service.

Food:
Interesting take on upscale casual.  We started with the Handmade Perogies with Kielbassa sausage ($13). I have always associated perogies with a doughy cheesy goodness with a little pan fry cripsyness. These were more like a Phlyo pastry version of perogies, light and fluffy.  Still very good, but different. Our entrees came up about 5 min finishing up our apps.  I ordered the Nasi Goreng ($16), basically its an Indonesian dish of Fried Rice cooked in soy and tamarind. It comes with a fried egg or you can have it with grilled chicken (+$5). Very tasty..I am filipino and having your eggs with rice is old hat for me, but this was very good.  My wife had the grilled cheese 2x4 with tomato soup ($10). She was a fan of the grilled cheese, but the soup was a too saucy in consistency for her.  Just a side note: other dishes that we saw when they were delivering to other tables looked awesome (flatbreads, burgers, fish and chips). 

Against the Grain Urban Tavern, good food, excellent service, nice view of the lake, ample patio space and trendy decor. I wouldn't mind coming back in the evening to sit and relax by the outdoor fireplaces for some eats and drinks"}
{"text":"So I've been there for lunch after hearing pretty good things about the place.  But then the waitress showed up after just a few seconds and after we told her to leave us a few more minutes she didn't seemed pleased so she turned away and didn't show up for another half hour. 
We finally ordered some oysters and some rainbow trout with quinoa which were acceptable. I mean nothing out of the ordinary. And another thing. My girlfriend ordered a Shirley Temple without alcohol because she was on antibiotics but they brought her a normal alcohol cocktail.  And then a huge 80$ bill plus the fact that that waitress didn't seem very impressed with the 15% tip....all in all I'll never go there again!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review before and I wish I could give 0 stars. Overall the service was bad and the food didn't justify the long wait. The food took over 30 mins to arrive after the time we ordered. It took 20 min for our server to come and actually take our order. We asked our server (I think his name is Alejandro; tall, dark hair and olive skinned) to change the channel on the tv but he never did even though he said he would update us. When we asked a second time after we got our food if the manager was okay with it, he stuttered out some excuse about the manager being too busy to change a channel. The restaurant had 6 tables inside. We order the tavern burger, a chicken sandwich, and fish tacos but they were out of fish tacos. The patty in the burger was really dry and tough, as was the chicken that wasn't even flattened or prepared to be placed in a sandwich. The fries were pretty good."}
{"text":"The CMYE was here, and I liked the house cocktails, friendly waiters, patio, and yummy nibbles. But I decided to come back for a dinner to see what the real deal is.

Real deal is pretty sweet. I called the night before to book a reservation, but they were booked solid past 6, so I went the loser route and decided on a 5pm reservation.
Don't judge me.

My friend and I were seated on the patio (beautiful view of the lake!) in their comfy couches. The waitress was attentive and our orders arrived quickly. I had the beet-cheese (forget what it's called exactly) salad which was nice, although a little plain. The beet was subtly sweet in a nice way.
My friend had the chicken pot pie, which she was really happy with too.

I also like this building for looking at the shiny twirling fish on the ceiling, the slide from the second to the first floor, and the google-schemed couches that dot the main level.

The one complaint is that the front desk greeters were not really quick to talk to us at all, even though there were four of them there and we were the only people at the desk. The same happened the night of CMYE and I read in other reviews that this problem is not just for me."}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious 2018. The location is really out of the way, and of course, lakeside patio is closed. The interior is decorated very nicely, but I couldn't help but notice how worn out the the bench/couch was as I sat down. On the Thursday night that we visited, there were still plenty of tables open around us. 

I am a fan of the food and portion size. I ordered the maple chipotle glazed salmon off of their regular menu because I had to leave early and I loved the flavors. The salmon was cooked perfectly, slight sear on the outside and tender on the inside. The glaze really complements the fish, just wish there was a little more of it. 

My friends tried the winterlicious menu. The duck drummies and spaghetti salad (which should really be called soba salad) were good but a little on the oily side. The butternut squash and pear soup would be my favorite out of the three. Sweet and flavorful, would recommend. Everyone decided to order the smoked pork side ribs for their main. Since it was smoked, the meat was a little less tender than I would've liked but it still fell right off the bone and the beer bbq sauce is pretty amazing. The desserts were really sweet, especially the banoffee pie. The chocolate cake was the most generous in terms of portions.

Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back again in the summer time when the trek down isn't as cold and the patio is open. I was slightly worried because of the negative reviews but I enjoyed my experience. I had no issues with the service and since the place was not busy, didn't feel crammed."}
{"text":"Very nice location on the water with a large outdoor patio.  Food quality was generally good but not exceptional.  Be sure to check out the specials since the best part of my meal was a seasonal soup.  Desert menu was limited and of the 3 items offered one was not available.
We waited to be seated for a long time and service was a bit slow but pleasant. I think I would return if in Toronto."}
{"text":"Simply put the food just sucks. The cocktail that I ordered sucked. The dark beer that my friend ordered wasn't there. Our earnest request to sit our party of 9 at the patio for a bit was denied. The bill that came wasn't clearly split as we had requested.

There is hardly any choice on the menu; I ordered the Tavern Burger and I think McDonalds/Burger King do a much better job. The patty was cold! the bread was dryer than usual. The fries just average. 

Another friend of mine ordered the Fish Tacos and she didn't like them either. 

The only one who said they liked their food had ordered the Smashed Avocado on Toasted Bread. There is not much you can mess up with Avocado and Bread.

The only bright spot here is it has one of the most beautiful locations and patio. Go there for a quick beer but avoid the food."}
{"text":"I'm trying really hard to like this place but the only thing it's got going on is location. Twice the food has been subpar at best. No cranberry mayo on the club sandwich, rusty lettuce in the Cobb salad and four chunks of avocado and four chunks of chicken on the fajita flat bread. Very disappointing. This place should be lined up down the street at any hour of any day but this tells you why it's not.  Come for patio beers and scenery but eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious this year. For 15 dollars and three courses I figured you couldn't go wrong. I had been here before just for drinks, and I thought they had a pretty good beer selection. The opening dish during Winterlicious which I had was the deep fried oysters with spicy wasabi sauce. It was delicious, but we only got two oysters each. (my only complaint) The second dish I had was the lamb stew with rice, and it was pretty good. No complaints, but nothing over the top. The best part of the meal though, was the dessert. The cheesecake was definitely yummy, but I got to have from someone's carrot cake and it was divine. I would definitely eat that carrot cake again if I was given the opportunity. This restaurant doesn't have a lot of competition in the area, so it's definitely solid. But I wouldn't tell someone to travel across the city to eat there."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio & scenery, great staff (Gio was everyone's favourite!) and incredible food - the pulled pork tacos were to die for - make this an amazing summer spot."}
{"text":"To celebrate Canada Day, my husband and I headed to Against the Grain Urban Tavern. It just open about a month again.

It was quite busy. We sat on a couch on the patio.  It was hot and sunny ... my cold draft tasted good!

As a snack, we ordered the Baja Roasted Chicken Nachos (melted Cheddar and Jack cheeses, bell peppers and red onions on a bed of crispy tortilla chips, served with salsa sauce, fresh avocado relish and chilli scented sour cream) which was good ... the chicken was spicy and and I could taste limes.

Our server, Natasha, took good care of us. There were lots of servers taking care of the patio and all seemed friendly.  The hosts seem a bit flustered but I'm sure they'll work that out.

There is a good selection of drafts at reasonable prices. At first glace, the price of food seems high (ex - $17 for a burger/fries) but they looked good and I bet is worth the cost."}
{"text":"The burger i had was kinda tasteless, the parking is not worth it for this place at $10 for 2 hours.  Definitely better to park at harbour front and enjoy your dinner there."}
{"text":"After seeing a Bluejays game, my wife and I walked along Queens Quay east and came across this restaurant. It has a surprisingly beautiful sight line of the lake. An outdoor patio is meters away from the lakes shore. That alone gives this location a 5 star. The unfortunate thing about this location is that it appears to be situated around some industrial buildings. That really didn't take away from how great this place. If you want to have a seat pre or post dinner, you could visit Sugar Beach. If you're in this area, on a nice sunny day, this is a place to visit. It's just as nice but only a few minutes further east than the Amsterdam Brewery, and well worth the travel.

As for the atmosphere, it's very cozy. My wife and I sat at a table for two that had couch like chairs. We were very comfortable. We even remarked on how we felt like we were on a cruise. The staff were efficient, professional, friendly and competent, made up primarily of very young adults. Our waitress was on the ball and a treat to deal with.

The food was pretty awesome. My wife had some sort of stir fry thing with an egg on top. It was not only different to us, but super fresh, and delicious. See my pictures. I had a Cobb Salad with Chicken. Weirdly it had a pretzel that came with it. That salad was great if it was bigger with all of its toppings minus the pretzel. It was still satisfying and tasty.  

Definitely go dine here. It's cozy, warm, fun, professional and tasty. I think it would satisfy the professional, and the casual."}
{"text":"Great spacious restaurant near Sugar Beach with a big patio overlooking the harbor. Came in here and had various dishes from their new summer menu - Asian and Island cuisine inspired dishes that are very shareable, flavourful without being heavy.

The patio is sure to be a big hit in the summer and a nice place to relax and chat with friends over drinks.

Definitely a place worth checking out."}
{"text":"I'd like to comment about the poor, slow and impolite service that we received on the patio yesterday during our scheduled 4 pm reservation.  Yes, we were early by 50 minutes, but the patio was empty and the hostess acted as though we were inconveniencing them for the set up.  Our passive aggressive hostess was impolite (although, she tried to be polite) and acted as though we were inconveniencing 

Food and drink was overpriced and mediocre. 

The service that we received was slow and a matter of fact, embarrassing for me, the organizer.
 
Service for drink and food was extremely slow and members of the group had to pay, eat, and run.  The restaurant was NOT busy and certainly a group of 14 cannot justify such slow service.
 
Do not recommend this at all even though the view is gorgeous.   

Note. General manager resolved our issue with a gift card. Unfortunately, we probably won't be back.   We probably should have checked the negative Yelp reviews before went."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience at this place. Waited around an hour for a salad, when it finally came it was basically only leaves and meagre toppings. $27 for a very sub standard salad. Not worth it at all. The nice staff were the only redeeming factor of this establishment. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We had just arrived in Toronto.  I had the chicken pot pie.  My fiance had the prime rib.  I very much enjoyed the pot pie.  Fiance was licking her fingers.  This petite woman devoured the prime rib.  She loved it.  French fries were also pretty good (we had as an appetizer).  Good service, not great.  But, the food was excellent, the location (sat outdoors near the water) was wonderful and the beer cold!"}
{"text":"Had the lobster pizza - utterly flavourless! Really disappointing. Fish and chips was also rather flavourless..for what you pay definitely expect better."}
{"text":"Great Patio, nice view , average service, decent food. I'll be back:)"}
{"text":"The food was 4 stars but the service was 3.  To be fair, this place was packed as it was near the sun set.  I would go back but have lesser expectations."}
{"text":"A beautiful view, average food, and mediocre staff. We, as a group of 8, were seated fairly quickly but this was not indicative of the service to come. It was about 20 minutes before we were greeted by our server for drinks, and it took another 15 minutes for it to arrive. One of the people in our group had trouble substituting proteins for more vegetarian-friendly options. Nonetheless, once our orders were taken, the food did come out in fast pace. The haddock and chips was decent, but it's really hard to mess up when you have good quality seafood. Overall, a fair experience that can be improved with better wait staff."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful; it's situated with right on the quay and has an extra large patio with ample seating - the view from here is great and peaceful. This place seems to be great for corporate and company gatherings, as was the case when we were there. The beer selection is pretty typical, and the food choices were pretty similar to what you'd expect at Milestone's or Moxies. For the price, the food left something to be desired. I had the ATG burger and fries, and for $18, I don't think there was anything notable about it. Service was slow, despite many servers going back and forth. And despite the patio being very large, it was chaotic weaving between the chairs, tables, and umbrella stands. 

In general, everything is pricier than it should be, and unless you really want to sit on the patio by the quay, there are probably better options around as this is quite out of the way for most people."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the worst food experience I've had ever encountered. Waited for an hour to have an table ready for a group of 4 with one pregnant women. While we're seated, we waited for another 30min to offer us water. Later the server took our order, and we waited for another 1.5 hour till the food arrives. Finally our food is being served, we couldn't believe after waiting patiently for 2 hours this is the type of food we see, Unbelievable! The fries looked like it have used a year old oil to fried!!  It looked extremely disgusting!  And not to mention that we have a starving pregnant women waiting to be fed. The waiter told us \"the fries \"always\" looked like that\" seriously... my pictures don't do the justice! I can't believe a restaurant out there is even allow to serve food like that! I'm worried that We will all end up being in the hospital. So I ask to speak to the manager, patiently waited for a good 10min and no manger shows up. Therefore we  were forced to leave the restaurant by starving for 3 full hours. I'm giving my 100% opinion to let this restaurants owner know that your restaurant not only don't solve problems but might be putting my pregnant friend at risk by serving the food you do. 

If you are reading reviews on this restaurant and deciding if you should give it a chance, I'm giving my most honest advice is to PLEASE STAY AWAY from this restaurant that serves the most disgusting food."}
{"text":"I visited against the grain with a group that includes younger children and the staff were truly accomodating. From moving tables around to providing crayons, coloring pad and kids menu, they went above and beyond what was expected of what is essentially a gastropub. 

In terms of the food I had a chance to try the tuna tartare and the fish and chips. Both were good although I was much happier with the fish and chips. 

Overall the staff and the serene waterfront view make against the grain a good spot, although the menu and prices won't exactly have me coming back every week."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Come for the patio, stay for the sloooow service.

This place ain't bad considering it's your only option if you find yourself at sugar beach - I know, ain't that a  great start for a review?! ATG has one of the best patios in town by virtue of its lakeside location. In the summer time, this is THE place to be to enjoy a brewski and sun.

Seeing as they're the only kid on the block, they could've gotten away with a craptastic menu, but instead, it's surprisingly good and can be considered an upgraded version to your typical pub fare. Their TAVERN BURGER is adequate and their ATG NACHOS are pretty solid. Prices skew higher than your average pub, but you're paying for the location. They have daily drink/food specials, so that's always a plus! Their bar is home to a healthy selection of beers, wines and cocktails - they even have Innis and Gun on tap, which is pretty rad!

The only thing is that they seem to be understaffed during peak times which lends itself to long waits. This isn't necessarily a bad thing when the weather's great, but it means your thirst doesn't get quenched as fast as you would like it to be."}
{"text":"* Awesome location, right by cherry beach and the lake. Perfect for Sunday brunch / lunch / chill / drinks

* Best patio around

* Food was decent. Ordered the Tavern Burger with Jalapeno, which cost $14 + 1.5 for Jalapeno topping with sweet potato fries. Not the best burger I've had but it satisfied my burger craving on a sunny day. Also ordered the Pork belly & Smoked Salmon salad which was very tasty ($12)

* Had the food tasted better for the price, I would have given it a 5

* There was a $4 bloody mary special and it was one of the best I've had.

* Tons of beer on tap, as well as bottled beers."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice now. Once for a Yelp event and another time with some co-workers.

The food is great, I really have no complaints here. The wings were good. The poutine was amazing! There's a vast drink selection so you shouldn't go thirsty here. If you do you should probably walk about 20 feet and stick your head in the lake. I tried a mojito which I would not order again. It seems like they didn't muddle the mint into the sugar. Almost like they just threw the right ingredients in and served it. So I switched to Stella, which for their Friday night special is $5 a pint. Done!

What held this back from a 4 star review for me was the service. Your experience here is going to be hugely dependent on which server you get. at the Yelp event, we had great service. Upon my second visit I ended up moving between three tables as our group grew throughout the evening. When we started inside the service was great. Same with the first table we moved to on the patio. Once we moved to another larger table on the patio the new server was terrible. He brought the wrong beer to some, couldn't answer questions, and was generally just not in a good mood.

I'll come back again for the food, but I really hope they can clean house in the staffing department."}
{"text":"Came back here to Against the Grain for their Weekly (Monday) Specials... I have to upgrade my experience to a 4 Star. 

ATG signature cocktail for $5 from 4 pm to Closing...what a deal!! And from 4 pm to 8 pm all the appetizers are $5 off. 

And the awesome patio with those loungers... and the fire at night..... 

I wish Toronto Patio season can last forever................."}
{"text":"This is a great place next to the water if you're looking for a nice patio that doesn't face a busy street. The service was friendly and even though they were very busy the server took time to indulge our request for a group photo. The place has a nice casual classy atmosphere but they were showing sports on all of the televisions (very blah).
I had the Quebec cornish hen which was juicy and delicious. The other two in the group had the Tavern steak, which was also very good. The raspberry and dark chocolate bread pudding with bourbon butterscotch sauce and cinnamon gelato was so fantastic just thinking about it makes me drool. I think I would go back just to have that again..... it was a little pricier than some places but it is worth if for the fresh, high quality food.

Bonus: they use locally grown produce and natural, hormone-free meats. 

Only negative: they have no parking lot so you have to pay $15 to park across the street at the Loblaws."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times during the summer, for a company event and for dinner. The highlight was definitely the beautiful patio seating overlooking the lake. Even inside, you won't miss out on the view because there is a giant window/glass wall which faces the lake. The service was always great - checking in on you and even coming by to apologize for their dim lighting for the outside seating (it was the building issue where the roof light was not working that time). 

We booked our company private event at the patio section outside. It was a nice space with some couch seating underneath the roof of the building. In fact about a good portion of the patio seats had a roof over and the ones that didn't have at least an umbrella to shield from the rain. However, that day we went was one of the rare rainy days where it was windy heavy and pouring rain. The rain kept blowing over and got us wet, so we had to shift the party inside. Normal rainy days would have been fine. 

The food was your standard affair. They had burgers, salads, sandwiches, ribs, wings etc. I had no complaints there. We ordered a variety in our company event and it was an open bar so I was able to try many things. But if you're going there for dinner, take note of their daily specials, which are great deals! Overall I really liked their beetroot salad and their watermelon mojito. 

FYI, They also have a Pokestop, by the patio, which keeps spawning Pokemon. I caught a bunch of Eevees and water Pokemon in one go!"}
{"text":"May 23rd 3:25 pm. Indoor section. 

Quite possibly the worst over priced food I have come across in Toronto. Took our intern server 15 min to bring the jalapeño that were missing off of our nachos. 

Don't waste your time or money at this dive."}
{"text":"They kind of rubbed me against the grain.

Their \"grilled\" salmon has an alien texture-- a hybrid of poached & microwaved? The result is quasi-rubber. How DID they do it? And where was the FLAVOR? This fish was bland, like the fish hospitals serve to patients recovering from gastric surgery. 

Ditto for the beer: Mill Street Original Organic. Why put a bland, boring beer on the menu? Aside from it being organic, it has NOTHING going for it. 

There were lots of servers for the outdoor patio, but inside there was only one guy serving AND he had to act as bartender for the entire restaurant. That poor bartender/server was working like an octopus and could be heard apologizing to every table for the delays.

I think this restaurant doesn't bother to hold itself to a higher standard because they have a monopoly in the Sugar Beach complex-- they're the only restaurant in the area. It's up to the customers to demand a better standard."}
{"text":"I don't mind slow service, if the server acknowledges that they are busy and it's going to take a while. Especially on a really gorgeous day on what is arguably Toronto's best patio. However, when the restaurant is at (estimated) 60-70% capacity and there are plenty of other people being served promptly, I have good reason to get a little angry.

Our server drifted in and out, never asked if we wanted more drinks, never offered dessert or coffee and would serve half our party, then the other half 20 minutes later.

The food was fine. I won't be back though, since I can have equal quality food for less money and better service at... say.... Boston Pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome patio with simply AMAZING VIEW!!! I can sit there all day, especially on those comfy couches....

Food is meh, but it's a brand new restaurant that is still trying to figure out what customers like (and dislike).... Quite a long way to go for the price they charge their food. Up the quality or drop the price.... That'll be my 2 cents for this resto!!!

Service needs significant improvement.... Please train your staff (tips and tricks, priorities and what to say/cannot be said to customers).

This location is GREAT for the Summer, not sure about Winter..... 

Hopefully they work on getting better sooner so I can go back before the Summer ends and have a more enjoyable experience."}

My friend and I decided to have a nice get together dinner by the lake so we ended up at Against the Grain. 

The patio was full when we arrived so the hostess asked for my number so she can text us when there's an available table. We were planning to order a drink at the bar while we waited but the bartender was too busy to serve us before our table was called.

The patio has regular tables that you would eat at and couches with a coffee table. I find it very awkward to sit on a couch to enjoy your meal so we got the regular table. Me and my friend shared their $18 sangria pitcher. It was my first time having sangria and omg it was delicious! It tasted like juice so by the time my actual meal came I was a bit tipsy. For my meal I ordered the ATG burger with fries and my friend got the salmon. The burger was great and tasted freshly made which is good. My friend's salmon order was pretty small and definitely not worth the price.

Overall, this is a great place to catch up with a friend, go on a date, etc. Decent food and a nice view. Against the Grain isn't easily spotted so make sure you walk to the back of the Corus building."}
{"text":"Went there In July, it was a warm day so we wanted a patio near the water. Against the grain was the perfect place. The sight was wonderful.
We ordered fish and chips, Tavern salad with chicken, chicken sandwich, and chicken nuggets for my friend's kid.
The food was well cooked, and the vegetables were fresh.
We had a lovely waiter who was on top of things.
I would definitely go back there and I recommend it for others.
Enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. Barely mediocre food. 

The server did not tell us that they had a drink special or that there were a bunch of taps NOT on the menu. We ended up ordering some pretty bad beers and when he came by and asked us how they were we told him \"meh\" and he did not react at all.

Food came, they gave us fries instead of the salad that we ordered, when we pointed it out, he took the plate away so I was left with a meal while the person I was with didn't have his. We didn't have cutlery, he never came to check on us once, and we asked for the bill but it never came so we just got up and paid on our way out as we were tired of waiting.

Do not come here unless you want to spend money on an over-priced, frustrating, slow and disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Talk about an amazing view, but that still didn't make up for our lackluster experience at Against the Grain.

A friend of ours chose this spot for his Birthday Brunch on one of those amazing, warm, sunny, Saturdays.  We were a group of 8, but because of prior commitments, were all coming in at different times, so we weren't too upset when they wanted to sit us on the 'shady' side of the patio, even though we asked to be seated on the sunny side where there were a number of empty tables. We asked a few times that if a spot became available that was large enough for our party, could we possibly move, because it was a little chilly in the shade. SURE! Not a problem, they said, as several large tables remained empty. Our waitress was very unpleasant towards us, even though she was quite pleasant with a group of young dudes sitting right next to us (in the sun, I might add).  After about 30 mins of staring at the same empty table perfect for our group, the birthday boy had had enough, and asked that we be moved, since there wasn't even a line up inside anymore. They finally obliged, but again, you could tell how peeved our waitress was. Fortunately, once we moved, we got a new waitress who was super pleasant and attentive and totally deserving of the tip that comes with a $600 (mostly booze) tab. The food was decent, but nothing memorable. 

If it's the view you're going for, I would recommend Against the Grain, but if you want great service and food... meh... I'm sure there are better in the area."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere here were great, but the service was okay. We waited a while for everything to come out, and it seemed like the waiter was a little over-burdened. The nachos and avocado toast were good, and the Green curry was REALLY good. Probably wouldn't eat here if not for the awesome patio with a view of the water"}
