{"text":"Was great.  Now CLOSED. Has become: Gia Visto, which is also very good."}
{"text":"I've been in the past and had fantastic food. I tried to go this past week and checked the hours online to make sure they're open on Mondays for lunch. The website indicates that they're open, but it turns out that they're closed and have been for a while. The sign on their door just indicates that they're closed for renovations (why didn't they mention that on their website?). However, the guy that owns that business next door (local crafts if you're in the market for a Steelers scrunchie or yard sign), La Cucina Dolce has been closed for a while and is actually quietly switching ownership. I'd give the past food five stars (cute restaurant, fantastic food, BYOB, and the best place in Monroeville by far), but I'm waiting to see what it's like under new owners and wish they would update their website in the meantime."}
{"text":"I am writing this to tell of an experience my Mother and her 5 friends had during dinner at this particular restaurant... After placing their orders everyone was brought their food, all was well except for my Mothers friend Suzanne. She had order a Portabello Mushroom Sandwich and was brought our some kind of fancy item with jumbo shrimp on top. Once she explained that it wasn't what she ordered the waitress appologized and took her new order. The waitress quickly returned with the mistaken order packed in a togo box and told her that she could take it home because the mistake was made by the staff. The box was placed on a table adjacent to where they were all sitting. Unfortunately the correct order came out after everyone else had finished eating which made for an awkward experience. Once everyone was ready to leave someone noticed that the box was now missing from the table behind them. Turns out the manager came back out and without making it evident took back the togo box with the mistaken order. Apparently giving away a dinner with shrimp on top was frowned upon by the owners. No one was certain if they were going to reuse the jumbo shrimp if another customer had ordered the same dish that evening or if they were just going to eat it themselves. All the women noticed it was gone, had a good laugh, paid their bill and left. Not one of them said they would ever go back. They all found what had happened to be odd and in bad taste. Comparing this to another review on here about being overcharged for a group party shows you what type of people the owners are and how they run their business."}
{"text":"A amazing little hip restaurant in the striving metropolis of Monroeville! It has great service & nice atmosphere. They had a special menu for Valentine's Day! We first had some tasty Lobster bisque. It was rich but full of lobster & taste. The Caesar Salad was good with nice addition of homemade croutons, tomatoes, & olives. My main course was a cajun spiced Monk fish with dried cherry jasmine rice, shirmp & mussels. It was scrumptious & the fish was cooked lovely. Very tasty meal. My sweet wife had Shrimp in a vodka pancetta sauce over fettuccine which was delicious. We topped it off with some great coffee with meaty piece of tiramisu! Our waiter, Mac, was outstanding & made great recommendations! Its also byob which is great too. This place is awesome & its in Monroeville!"}
