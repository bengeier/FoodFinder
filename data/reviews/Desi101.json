{"text":"Great chicken tikka and fluffy garlic naan. Big portions, quick, friendly service. Great price too, especially compared to the Indian food in surrounding neighborhoods. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It was kind of hard to find a place that seemed appealing to us and open on a Saturday afternoon in down town.  We actually walked by here twice before we decided to come in.  So glad we did!  Easily the best restaurant we went to in our short stay in Cleveland.  I love Indian food and Desi really surprised me.  On the weekends they have a buffet setup for lunch.  It's not large, but I promise you everything is going to taste amazing.  There was maybe 12 items and every single one actually tasted fresh like it came straight from the kitchen.  The chicken in both the biryani and the tandoori were one of the most tender and juicy I've had in a long time.  The goat curry was falling off the bone tender, another rare finding at a buffet.  The butter chicken actually tasted like butter.  Even the raita tasted better than most restaurants I've been to.  The fried items were still crunchy and the rice was pillowy soft.  Loved it!  But what I loved the most was that the level of spice was really perfect.  Not hot enough to where you're begging for water, but hot enough to clear out your sinuses.  And when we sat down, the owner brought a fresh basket of straight from the oven naan, dripping with butter.  Crusty bottom, soft inside and oh so good.  Definitely worth stopping in for!  You really can't beat that for $10.  Honestly this little place was better than 95% of Indian restaurants in Chicago.  They've only been open for two weeks or so.  Show the new Indian joint some love, peeps."}
{"text":"Ordered via Ubereats, cancelled one of the items without informing me or Uber and only found out at delivery."}
{"text":"I'm always very happy with this place and so thrilled to have such an excellent Indian restaurant so close to my place of business. Working downtown means I have dozens of choices nearby and I have picked this spot time and time again.   It's a café style eatery where you select your bowl size and then the items you want in your bowl. The bowls are actually divided containers for an entrée or two (or three) and a side. I always start with a type of rice or naan and then pick the meats I like. The meats are in different sauces and the selection changes all the time for great variety. (They keep everything at a medium heat, which is nice cuz I'm a wuss.) They fill your container with your choices and you then pay and sit where you like. The place has about a dozen tables of various sizes and some are next to the window.   The prices are pretty good with the regular bowl at $6.99, the super bowl at $7.99, and the mega bowl at $8.99. The sides range from $2 to $5 or so. I've even had them sneak in a surprise side before that always put a smile on my face.   I have enjoyed everything I've gotten from there and the helpful and friendly staff are fantastic people. Always cheerful and smiling and happy to see me. Please be sure to grab a Mango Lassi drink and you will thank me in your subconscious.   ; -)  J-Ru"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here right before visiting the Cleveland Public Library. The décor is still rough and the guys are finding their feet, but the food is outstanding. The Chicken 555 is like nothing else I've had - absolutely excellent - and the mango lassi afterward was a superb treat. Support these guys, it's some great food and they deserve to make it work!"}
{"text":"Came to Desi101 for a last minute graduation party set up- everything from the service to the food was EXCEPTIONAL. We had a party of about 16 people which is usually hard to accommodate, but the staff pulled through ( the owner is part of the staff and on a side note- truly a humbling experience to have the service we did).  For appetizers, we had four servings of mirchi bajji and spicy chicken. If you're a spice lover or love the taste or chili chicken- highly highly recommend the spicy chicken!! For the main courses, in order from \" would travel 1000 miles to try again,\" to \" love completely,\" it would be 1) andhra style chicken 2) biriyani 3) Gutti Vankai 4) mutton. On a side note, you can order the biriyani as a vegetable biriyani or chicken biriyani and in general, the restaurant is vegetarian friendly. For sides, the regular Naan is wonderful, but you can honestly skip it and get the garlic naan instead ( just tastes better with everything).   Lastly, because we had no room to eat and just wanted to stay longer, I ordered the mango lassi. If you have a sweet tooth like me, and really love the authentic feel of mango.... don't skip out on it!!!  Overall, it was a great experience and if you want the backstory of two CSU students starting a restaurant Indian business out of college, you should ask them!! Wonderful people with a wonderful business"}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food in Cleveland downtown .. Biryani is a must try... lunch options are descent quantity for the price"}
{"text":"Good Indian food, was a little spicy for me, but I wd love to go back for their Chicken biriyani and baby corn!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Indian food in CLE. Absolutely amazing. I've had my fair share of Indian food and this is one of the best spots I've had (throughout the country). Service is great, servers are helpful and friendly. Try the samosas for an appetizer and the desi chicken chef special...both AMAZING! I will be going back weekly. Great for take out and dine in."}
{"text":"So glad a new Indian place has opened downtown! There previously was an Indian restaurant in this space that went out a business a few years ago. It was okay but Desi101 is amazing! Decided to go in around 1:30 to see if they had a lunch buffet. They don't, but they do have a bowl model: three different sizes all very reasonably priced. Mine had a large portion of rice (your choice in what kind) and two mains from a very decent selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Cost $8.99, came with naan, and I genuinely couldn't finish it all. They also have a full menu you can order from if you don't want a take-out bowl.   I think perhaps the best part though besides the food tasting amazing and this place being a 2 minutes walk from my office, is the two guys who were working there. Not sure if they're the owners, but so incredibly kind! Came by to refill our waters, ask how the food was and if we wanted to try anything else, and at the end when we were leaving with our leftovers, they came with a plastic bag for us to carry it in. Great service and very friendly people.   I really hope this place lasts! I'll definitely come a few times a week for lunch. If you work downtown or are just visiting, highly recommend this place for good Indian!"}
{"text":"I just happened to walk by and I'm so glad I stopped in. I travel all over for work, and Indian is my favorite. I'm heart broken I don't live in cleveland so o could eat this every day. This was some of the best Indian food I've ever had. I can't reccomend this place enough."}
{"text":"We moved downtown to experience more of Downtown Cleveland.  The Desi 101 is a delightful treasure to find.   Ordered the Punjabi Butter Chicken with garlic and butter naan.  Fabulous!  We will definitely be back to try their Saturday lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Nice small place with a tasty and authentic Indian food. Great quality and appropriately priced."}
{"text":"Stopped by Desi101 today for lunch and had the butter chicken along with a side of rice and potatoes. My dine in meal, including a 10% yelp discount and water, was $8.74. That's a good price for high quality, tasty food.  I should've gotten seasoned rice instead of white rice, but it was tasty, nonetheless. The potatoes were delicious. My favorite of the three was the butter chicken. It was excellent and I will consume it again in the future. I'll be back to try some additional dishes."}
{"text":"Pretty good Indian spot, right by public square.  While being stuck on jury duty, I was looking around a new restaurant to try on my long lunch break. Enter Desi101.   It's located across the street from Jack casino on Ontario. It's a good price for what you get- for $6.99, you get a bowl (entree + side), $8.99 a super bowl (two entrees + side), and $10.99 for the largest one (I forget the name of it, but it's three entrees + side).  The sides range from samosas to naan or briyanis-  I chose a vegetable briyani.  They have lots of different entrees- I chose the tandoori chicken. I was surprised on how much they really loaded onto my bowl size- I'm glad I didn't get a larger size because there would be no way to finish it!  It also comes with the yogurt sauce or whatever that's called too..  Overall, I thought the food was good. I underestimated the spice level of the tandoori chicken (oops) and my nose wouldn't stop running due to my weak spice tolerance.. haha.. but I thought the food was cooked well- and it felt like a homey hole in the wall type of restaurant.  If I'm ever back downtown and need an Indian spot to stop by, I would definitely stop here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious and very filling place to get lunch. The double can essentially be 2 lunches if you so choose. Glad this place went back to being an Indian spot."}
{"text":"I normally try out new restaurants for lunch so I thought I would give this place a try. It is a unique setup and they offer 3 different sized bowls with entrees and sides. When I asked the man working the register about the deals and whats included he was super helpful in explaining the difference between bowls and which items you can include. The food was great too. The chicken dum biryani was perfect. Great spices and flavor. The spicy chicken did not mess around and had a decent kick to it. The chicken tikka masala was spot on. For the prices and portion this place is a go. Food available immediately, great service, and well flavored food will have me coming back for sure. Well done."}
