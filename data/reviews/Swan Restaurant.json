{"text":"This place used to be great. I used to go at least a few times a month when I lived in the area a couple of years ago. So I was excited to go again and show my friend my \"old local brunch place\".   To be honest I was sorely disappointed in the service and quality of food. When we arrived there were 2 free tables right in front of us but we were still told to wait. We waited awkwardly a few minutes while the servers chatted and laughed with each other in the corner in no rush to try and seat us. Eventually we just sat down at the free table right next to us and the server came over in a huff like we'd just \"disobeyed\" her.  And then there was the food. It was nothing like it used to be. Soggy toast, greasy yet undercooked eggs, potatoes are not crispy like they used to be and they now have a different spice on them with a taste I can't place, but the best way to describe it would be... weird.  Coffee would have been good if it wasn't luke warm.   Not a good experience. I am extremely disappointed that their quality seems to have gone downhill since I last went.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"A very solid local joint. Don't go out of your way for it but if you already there you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Really, truly, the Grey Gardens of West Queen West dining, go a little further west people, the time has come!!!! @queen and shaw"}
{"text":"This place is great. Great wines, oysters,  menu, servers and atmosphere for a hip lunch or dinner of solid quality with loads of substance. The classy retro feel make you feel at home. Classy, down home and hip all at once. I have enjoyed fifty odd meals here and have NEVER been disappointed."}
{"text":"This has been on my brunch list for awhile so I was excited to finally go.  I was craving pancakes but since they didn't have any I opted for the french toast. My french toast arrived half brown/black. Though it didn't taste burnt, I picked off most of the blacken egg that coated the bread. The maple syrup saved the dish. My sister had the Green Eggs (chiffonade of kale & some other green that I forgot, hash browns & 2 fried eggs). The chiffonade was fresh, making it a good compliment to the fried eggs. The hash browns were good but like the french toast about a quarter of it was burnt black. The cumin made the hash browns different (in a good way) but in certain bites it was a bit too much.  The freshly squeezed grapefruit and apple juice were delicious.  I'm glad I went to check it out but I wouldn't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've passed by this breakfast and brunch place many times while going to a different spot. To my surprise it was not crowded as it usually is; so my partner and I got a spot within 5 minutes.   We ordered the smoked salmon salad and the swan breakfast.  - Smoked salmon salad was delightful; it had a great creamy but not too heavy kind of dressing, plus generous amounts of smoked salmon. I'm a sucker for avocado and I was happily surprised when they incorporated half an avocado in it. This is a definitely a must try.   - Swan breakfast was good but nothing that stood out to my partner. The choice of sausage was a great combination with the scrambled eggs which by the way were made perfectly.   I've docked one star because the soup of the day did not impress me as it tasted like a chilli instead of a soup.   Overall the service was awesome, good food and the servers were prompt and friendly. I would definitely come back to try the other choices!"}
{"text":"Points for atmosphere, service.. Dinner menu is a little potato laden but oysters and meat options make it up"}
{"text":"Hit and miss... but more hit than miss!  I would say that for the most part, dinner at swan is pretty good! I would avoid the lamb burger (overcooked and too lamby, too much dijon), but the pork chop and beef rib are both insanely delish.  Breakfast on the other hand is always wicked and tasty.   The coffee is super, but who wouldn't love refills with breakfast on a sunday? (hint hint swan).  Wait staff are great.  Resto management on the other hand... a little indifferent and superior. I complained about the lack lustre lamb burg, and the manager couldn't really care any less.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to Swan a couple of weeks ago with my sister when she was in town. It's a small diner with a small menu but their food is pretty tasty.   We had really good service and the prices were completely reasonable. We didn't have to wait to get seated.  I and the eggs benedict with spinach and smoked trout, which was very good, not the best I've had but definitely above average.   Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"We were meeting some friends in Toronto and were looking for somewhere to do a Saturday Brunch before leaving.  We have to say that the Swan delivered.  I had the Hangtown Fry,  everyone elas had the rancheros.  We were all very satisfied and felt the service was very good.  If you go plan on waiting out side.  It was a great day to wait outside when we went but this maybe something to keep in mind in the winter."}
{"text":"I'd gone to Swan a couple of times back when they first opened ('98? '99?) and remembered really enjoying their food. I'd not returned until last Thursday night (so many other dining options, so little time), so I was dubious that the quality would still be there given that, sometimes, with the passage of time -- and with the associated initial popularity well-established, chef turnover, etc. -- decent places go downhill. But I was very happy to find that this was not the case w/ Swan.   Firstly, the ambience is just as cozy and intimately-charming as it always was -- which isn't easy to pull off for a retro 50's diner. The service was great: genuinely- friendly, attentive but not intrusive. When we first arrived and were considering the wine options, our server was extra-busy so the less-busy bartender helpfully approached us with his suggestions, and he was spot on, a very tasty tuscan red (sorry, can't remember the name!).  Everything ordered was good to very good:  -the mussels app ($11) was exceptional (and a fair portion), the broth was so tasty we went through the first batch of fresh white portuguese-style bread (re: sopping) within minutes, not un-noticed by our server who brought more, unsolicited.   - my generously-portioned, perfectly-cooked and really flavourful salmon entree (fish special-$22) arrived beneath a scrumptious pesto-tomato coulis, with a side of a risotto cake beneath rapini in a fresh-tasting, tomato-based sauce.   -my DC's beer-braised beef shortribs were incredible, as was the side of velvety, buttermilk mashed.  I have one minor complaint - the low-lighting makes reading the menu difficult -- an irritation that I'm finding is more common now. one votive candle on the table does not provide enough light -- if a restaurant insists on that degree of darkness, this can be easy resolved by putting a couple more votive candles on the tables, ya?  Overall, very good value and a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Up until a month ago, I had never been to Swan for brunch. In the past month, I've been there 3 times. hmmm? Love at first bite you say?   Swan's take on huevos rancheros will kick anyone's ass out of mexican water. Generous/sizeable/ample portions at a great price. This is not one of those \"let me charge you extra $2 for taking the yolks out of your eggs\" type of places. This is the real deal! Infact, when I annoyingly inquired whether I will pay extra for trying to keep it healthy with egg whites only, our uber cool waiter replied \"definetely not, I dont get why places do that\".. ME neither Mr.ubercoolwaiter, me neither!  No drip coffee here. Straight up Americano all the way slightly burnt just the way I like it.  Seating is limited but I have never waited past the 10 minute mark. Service is great! Not one smirk, not one eye-roll in sight. Eggcellent!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!!  The ambiance is very nice and cozy. The staff is very friendly and they always have wicked awesome specials.  The crab cakes are to die for and I haven't had braised beef short ribs this good in my life!  They have an extensive wine selection and the beer choices are local with Creemore on tap. It doesn't get better than this :)"}
{"text":"The Swan seems like old school West Queen West joint that's gotten a really good facelift without any of that Burt Reynolds puckering you see all over town.  It's tiny, like maybe ten booths and a bar. The food is great for dinner ad brunch. They always have a lot of papers to read during brunch (which is key when you have a hangover).  It looks like a crappy little spot that serves greasy eggs, and that's the total beauty of it.  I also heard that it's the best place in town to break up with someone. So keep that in mind when you check it out."}
{"text":"I always have and I always will love Swan Restaurant.  Swan makes a sunglasses-and-Advil-hangover bearable.  The diner vibe is comfy cozy.  The Americanos are strong, piping hot.  The Eggs Benny, without exaggeration, is the best this city has to offer if you order it with peameal bacon (it's not on the menu ooooo!)  The long waits and hipster-style anti-service can be annoying, but hey, if this place is good enough for Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake to reconcile at, it's good enough for me."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a brunch spot with great value on Queen West, look no further than the Swan.  Since we arrived shortly after 10 we were able to avoid the brunch rush. The space is on the small side, so I'd recommend arriving early to avoid a long wait. The small space has a retro diner feel to it with tight booth seating and a few seats at the bar.   What went in my belly:  Smoked Arctic Char Salad - with new potatoes, greens, avocado and a dill aioli ($13). One word: LOVE! There was a generous portion of delicious smoked arctic char and half an avocado which gave the dish a nice creaminess. I'd gladly order this again.  Hangtown Fry - smoked oyster and pancetta egg scramble ($9). Many of the dishes here incorporate smoked fish and oysters so we decided to stick to these kind of dishes. When the Hangtown Fry arrived, I was a little surprised since I was expecting scrambled eggs. It turned out to be more of an omelette. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable dish. I particularly enjoyed the bits of smoked oysters and the saltiness from the pancetta.  Overall, we had a great brunch at the Swan. Compared to some of the other brunch spots we've been to, I thought the value was really great. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The Worst risotto ever! It was undercooked covered in goat cheese which I usually love but not as the ONLY flavour. The quarter glass of wine was just cheap... My partner had the steak and meh....  Seriously? Where does this place get off charging what they do? Pretentious and overpriced.. if you like those qualities then you will love this joint."}
{"text":"Famous place. Everyone knows it.  The whole place needs a refresher, or at least a coat of paint. Don't venture down the cellar to the bathrooms. The whole area has a musty smell and there was mould in the ceiling in one of the bathrooms.  The food was so-so, and what was most disturbing was that the hamburger was red in the middle, a big food safety no-no. We sent it back for re-heating. (No offer of a replacement)  All told, a decent meal for the rest of us, but absolutely nothing outstanding. The price was reasonable.  The service was friendly but the manager insisted on assaulting our eras with \"his\"  music played far too loud for our conversational aspirations. A call for lower volume didn't do much good. We had to keep on shouting to each other.  Sorry to all of you who like this place, but it's not good enough against the competition in the area."}
{"text":"Generally a great brunch, but order orange juice and you get it from a carton..  & in the winter, if you are unlucky enough to get the seat by the front door, better keep your coat on...curtain? or double door? .a choice the owner makes between his aesthetic and customer comfort?.. So five stars for the brunch, minus one for the cheap orange juice, & one for the freezing your ass off by the door."}
{"text":"Swan is consistently one of the best dining spots in Toronto.  During the weekends, the place is packed for brunch with line-up out the door.  The place was and still looks/feels like an old school greasy diner.  But the food is anything but just plain grease.  Good service and where else could you get fresh shucked oysters and a Caesar (topped with freshly grated horseradish) at 10am?  At night, the dining service is casual, hip-enough-for-Queen-West, and tasty.  My favourite Swan dining experience is a 7:30pm summer seating when the sun is still out.  You get that diner vibe until the sun sets, the candles are lit and the restaurant transforms into an intimate spot.  Must go for both brunch and that casual (not trying too hard) dinner."}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch, but have never been disappointed. Great variations of eggs benedicts, excellent staff!   Get there early (before 11) if possible, otherwise you will probably be waiting"}
{"text":"i went to Swan Restaurant for Saturday brunch after reviewing it on this website! Jackie P's review made me laugh out loud and it seemed like a pretty cool place.  We showed up around 11am and were really lucky to score the last available table at the very back, right beside the kitchen the stairs leading to the bathroom.  The place has a very retro feel to it, like its a 50's diner.  I loved that they had coat racks at every booth.  I expected the service to be unfriendly, but our server was actually really nice, and had a big smile on her face the whole time we were there.  Service is fast and efficient.  As for the food, there are a lot of standard \"eggs and bacon\"  options, and some interesting options such as oysters, arugula salad, etc.  The coffee was americano, you could tell that they had just brewed it individually.... pretty strong!  Unfortunately, this means no free refills.  My 'benedicts' came with lots of hash browns, a roasted tomato, a slice of orange and a slice of cantalope..  the servings are pretty big.  The poached eggs were perfectly cooked.  The hash browns were nice and onion-y.  The only negative things i noticed were everything was slightly cold, and the hollandaise sauce was sweet and tangy, rather than creamy and delicious.  This really sticks out because hollandaise sauce, makes an eggs benedict in my opinion, but this sauce just tasted weird.  I wouldn't order it again.  My friends 'special omlette of the day' had roasted pears, orange peppers and cheese.  Also served with potatoes and fruit.  The omlette was humongous, and very tasty.  I would order this again, but i would split it between two people, as even my very hungry friend and i couldn't finish it!  All in all, it was very delicious, satisfying breakfast.  A bit pricey (10-12$ for a breakfast entree), excellent service and good food.  Oh!  and as a final note, the washrooms (non-accessible, in the basement) are lovely!  pretty and clean."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant while strolling through the neighborhood on vacation. Excellent food that is anything, but \"diner\" quality. My fish special was fantastic. My husband loved the lamb burger."}
{"text":"Good for lunch. Tasty food, a bit on the heavy side."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for dinner and beers. Stepping into this place is like going through a time warp. I LOVE the vintage decor and feel. The place is small and intimate. The booths can probably fit four people snugly and there is also a counter to eat at. Our server Angie was great. Attentive without hovering. I had the southern BBQ plate which I wouldn't really call BBQ although it was fantastic. I actually fully cleaned my plate. The plate consists of house made sausage which is a good size and just a little spicy, grits which were good but could have been a little creamier and collard greens which were excellent. I would have preferred that the greens weren't chopped up so small and the portion could have been more generous but I'm just saying that because they were so good I could have eaten twice as much! My boyfriend had the BBQ capon which he said was falling off the bone and cooked perfectly; very high praise coming from someone so picky. The food did take a while to make it out to our table but it was well worth the wait. Prices were not inexpensive but certainly reasonable for the quality and size of portion. All in all a great experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today and the experience was pretty mediocre. We waited for 30 minutes to get our food. When it came both meals we ordered were soaking in oil. My wife actually had to lay napkins under the food on her plate (pic added). I expect heavy oil when going to places like this, but the amount was over the top. The servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"What a perfect spot for a Monday brunch. Had the burger with sunny side egg ontop. Delicious coffee as well!!"}
{"text":"I'd have to say that my situation is much like Kent P.'s.  I went in for what was (supposed to be) a quick grilled cheese during my lunch break. Ended up waiting over half an hour for said grilled cheese (which was good, but not ground-breaking). As Kent stated in his review, there were completely unapologetic and really didn't seem bothered by the tardiness.  My friend qualified the place as a hipster joint, and I can't say he's wrong, and therein lies such a big problem with Toronto's restaurant scene. Too many hipsters think service is all about style. They think a handlebar moustache or wearing a blacksmith's apron from 1902 is all it takes.  Sorry folks, but it really is all about substance. Don't under-staff, don't get snippy or arrogant. Don't forget simple things like side of fries with side of salad. In effect, try a little harder.  Pretend like we were in the midst of another great depression and that if you lost your job, you'd be eating out of dumpsters because there are no other jobs. Bah, who am I kidding - hipsters will never understand."}
{"text":"I adore the old fashioned decor. This is real vintage, and though it's called SWAN restaurant, there's something of the diner feel going on here. It's that retro beveled edge on everything look, the teak wood wall detailing along one wall. It's also the small intimate booths, brought to a greater romantic height by nothing but candlelight, with the overheads so far dimmed they're nearly off. It does set this good mood. But how good is the well known food? Even though this is only my second time properly sitting down and trying some oysters, I wound up acting like an authority on them. Amanda and Stine hadn't ever tried them. There was some nervousness! When served with a plate of slippery shells, their pink grey contents look hard to tackle. There's only one piece of advice I could impart: just suck. As anyone whose eaten oysters knows, there's no particularly classy or clean way to enjoy the fruit of the sea. I was happy with the condiment selection, which had everything from lemons, horseradish and hot sauce to more innovative dressings like plum vinegar, smoked tomato chili paste, and one other thing which was never identified. The oysters were what I would hope for: fresh, watery, tasting like the sea, a delicate vessel for light seasoning, with a hint of natural musk. There was a feeling of camaraderie and sharing at our table, and not one of us ordered a dish that wasn't to share. Decisions were made by troika! After the oysters we consented to a collation of salad with smoked arctic char and avocado. We then consented to the knowledge that no salad with so much avocado should be drenced in heavy, cloying mayo dressing. What thought spurred this action? It ruined the salad- like a coat of butter. I am not exagerating the heavy handedness of the sauce, which coated every lettuce leaf in entirety. The fish was good, though so full of natural salt it didn't taste fishy at all. The dill advertised as a main flavor was also very mild, and the potato nibbled involved were bacony. This should have been like a much improved version of a nicoise, but fell far from the mark.  For a heartier dish betwixt courses we chose a two cheese risotto, with asiago and chevre. The fat arborio rice was studded with half moon zicchini slices. It was piping hot! Using asiago made the risotto drier than the many creamy varieties I've had in the past, and there was quite the tug of war between the two cheese for a dominant flavour. Chevre wanted to be creamy, asiago wanted to bite, and in the end I was left with a flavour impression regretably reminiscent of mac'n'cheese. From a box.   Our entree was actually very good overall, and that was a nice turn on a meal that had quickly turned bad. A plump and generous pork chop sat above sundry sides. There was a fluffy cornmeal biscuit, whose grains rolled along my tongue with an ethereal fluffiness, piqued with jalapeno nibs for spice. There was the fine puree of sweet potato, like applesauce in texture and very sweet, surely mixed with brown sugar. I was reminded of thick molasses, as well as earthy root. Veggies came in the form of buttery green beans and the fattest brussel sprout I ever ate. They were still very crunchy and fresh, only lightly steamed. The meat itself had a definite grain, and was not so succulent as to fall apart. It was firm, with a thick rind of fat, and lots of flavor. I did like the presentation, with a roast apple ring laid on top.  The best thing we had at SWAN was the oysters- from Oyster Boy, which is just next door, and probably a better place to go if you're looking for dinner near Trinity Bellwoods."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to religiously frequent the Swan for brunch. The customer service was exceptional and the food was great. However, we haven't been there in a while.  We really want to stay in love with the Swan but the place needs to shake up its menu. They need to get their portion sizes down; the dinners are ridiculous.  And they need to get rid of the cook that burns the potatoes and undercooks the omelette fillings on the weekends."}
{"text":"Decent.Good vibe.Food and pricing were good,just not a huge selection.Went Saturday brunch and waited 20 mins..worth checking out"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times and I find it very cozy. Not too fancy, dim lighting, and warm.  This is by no means a big place so be sure to make reservations if you plan on going. That being said, I've never had trouble getting a table. I have been a few times for dinner and I have yet to be disappointed. I always order the oysters, and most of the time I get the duck.  Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Classic spot.   Service is usually great.   Lunch is great. They bake their own bread for the club sandwich.  Wine selection is awesome.  Coffee is not good. Get a tea."}
{"text":"Quite a poor showing in the service department from Swan. 45 minute wait with little reason (or apologies) for a grilled cheese and club house sandwich. They did reduce the bill after some negotiation which brings this review from 1 star to 2, but I won't be going back. The food was average but certainly not worth the wait. From what I've heard, this is not unusual occurrence.  When I originally inquired about food time at the 30 min mark, I was met with a quite dismissive attitude that told me the server's cup of coffee was more important than getting their job done. Oh well, thankfully the city is not short of lunch options!"}
{"text":"Ugh Swan Restaurant! This place is great. I always order the fish of the day and am always pleased with it. Mussles and oysters always amazing as well. Great service, great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service was lack luster as was the food. My friend recommended this place for Brunch today.  It was nothing special, but was quite cheap.    We waited outside for about 25 minutes before being sat at our table that was a bit too close to our neighbour's table.    The French Toast was plain and simple,  basically just 2 peices of bread on the plate with 1 slice of melon. She had Huevos Rancheros which she did not finish or say anything great about.  The decor is hipsterish in an unkempt way and bathrooms were atrocious.... could use a lot of love.   Overall for a brunch I think Toronto has much better offerings that won't leave you feeling like you could have made something just as good at home."}
{"text":"I ended up at Swan by chance because my favourite lunch spot that is practically next door (OK, it's actually next door) was pumped to the rafters. I immediately started sulking until my friend suggested we try Swan. Since I was starving and only had to take a few steps to the right, I agreed. My friend also insisted that this place was not only charming, but served up some ridiculously good food. I believe anything I hear, so I went with it. I plopped down in a seat and took in my new surroundings. I decided I would decorate my apartment in the same way. Nice wooden interior, some funky fresh bar stools, and a cosy vibe.   The menu is concise, which makes ordering a breeze. I decided on the arugula salad (loved the pear and goat cheese combo) and club house (cannot go wrong with chicken, avocado and pancetta). Not very adventurous I know, but at least I refrained from ordering the grilled cheese (which is actually the fancy kind, not the kind I make with Kraft singles). All the options on the lunch menu looked equally inviting and I was told that the dinner choices are also too legit to quit. Whatever that means. I need this to be proven, so I have no choice but to return to Swan sooner rather than later where it'll be hammer time!"}
{"text":"I love love love the french toast here for brunch with the raspberry coulis. I love sitting in the big front window overlooking the street. I think this place is great. My boyfriend thinks it's a bit expensive, but I think it's just fine. YUM!"}
{"text":"The food was good, not great and the service is slow. However, I LOVED the brussel sprouts. I agree with the post below, the servers really dont seem interested in serving customers. Thinking this may be a better brunch or lunch spot.  Go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Eggs & Oysters for Sunday-Fun-day, why not?  After many dinners, brunches and first dates at Swan, it remains steady as one of my quaint neighbourhood favourites in Trinity Bellwoods.  The seating and layout provide an old school diner feel. The service is always fun and attentive.  I brunched at Swan today with a few friends.  We started with a dozen freshly shucked oysters to share. These tasty fun aphrodisiacs were followed up with brunch eggs. My brunch choice was the huevos rancheros. Great flavours and consistencies throughout. Came with amazing potatoes as well.  Not a super healthy dish, yet not overly greasy.   I have had many dinners at Swan, it' s a great spot for a fun, comfortable dining experience with great food, yet casual vibe & reasonable prices.  The kitchen never disappoints. The service is friendly and attentive. Great drinks (like the iced tea lemonade).    The desserts are also often interesting and superb (in my view one of the best  creme brûlée's in the city and I'm a creme brûlée connissuer!). I have gone in larger groups and also on dates which lasted very long. Have always felt comfortable, never rushed and well taken care of. Only drawback, the booth seats are not the most comfortable seating in the world, especially in groups of four (two is more comfortable). Love this spot and will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"As my 2nd meal out on P90X- ie low carb, low fat, high protein, I agreed to go out for brunch with a friend for her birthday.  At 11am, there was a short wait, and when my friends ended up showing up later than expected, the waitress actually asked if it would be OK if I sat another party ahead of me! How nice is that? I said yes, but once my friends showed up, we were sat immediately.   I ordered the omelet of the day - egg white only. I should have asked for something other than that huge pile of potatoes, which reportedly has fennel in it. In 90 days, I'm coming back and going straight for Huevos rancheros, with home-made salsa, black beans and tortillas looks to-die-for!"}
{"text":"I found Swan by mistake...and I'm happy I did.  4 of us were wondering the streets of westend Toronto on a cold winters night. Everywhere on Ossington was packed...same with Dundas West. We were cold and hungry so we said \"Screw it, let's just eat some damn vegetarian food at Fresh.\"  I was NOT in the mood for stupid vegetarian food (no offence Fresh or vegetarians, I just wanted to eat a delicious dead animal that night).  As we approached Fresh I saw the sign for SWAN right next door, so we decided to give it a shot....and there was a table available - SWEET!.  It's really small inside and it looks like an old diner - loved it.  The server was funny and nice and told us everything we needed to know about the menu.  To start I had the soup - it was a butternut squash soup. Now, I make my own and it's pretty darn good, but I REALLY enjoy the soup at Swan. The flavours were so rich and there was a hit of something spicy that really went over well. It warmed me right up from the cold.  For my main I had the short ribs. WOW. Huge portions, perfectly cooked. 100% delicious flavour bomb in my mouth.  I've been back several times since and I am always pleased. I hear they do a good brunch too, but I've never been. Hopefully soon.  Check out this little GEM - it's great!"}
{"text":"I would like to consider myself a brunch aficionado.  I take the brunch experience very seriously.  I attempt to hit up new spots every weekend and find hidden gastronomic treasures around the city.   My brunch experience at Swan  Location and accessibility: found street parking right in front of the restaurant. Booyah.  Service: We were seated at the bar and attended to promptly.  Our server was pleasant and attentive.  Atmosphere: the contemporary funky dining room area was reminiscent of a 50s diner; fitted with leather booths, arborite tables,  painted exposed ductwork,  throw back retro bar stools, a retro fridge a vintage coca cola cooler full of oysters! I felt like Billy Holiday should be playing and I should be defending Marty Mcfly's honour against Biff.  Value: excellent value and reasonably prices. brunch dishes ranging from $9-14 a plate.  Menu:  not a huge selection of items, however, interesting combinations, some with oysters.  I selected the eggs benedict and it was very tasty. The hollandaise sauce was a little thick for my liking, but it was still creamy and smooth.  Overall, it was a very lovely experience. Another gastronomic treasure in west queen west=) bonus=it is right by one of my new favorite boutiques (Bicyclette)    Thanks so much for your time! Jenna"}
{"text":"The Perfect Coffee!  We went for brunch, and I ordered the most boring thing on the menu; The Swan Breakfast.  It was a late Sunday morning, and lets just say I felt like I walked into a bus accident. The server started us with some coffee and waters. I took a quick sip of water... it was cool on my tongue...  Then I moved to the coffee and WOW.  Its brewed to perfection. Using extreme heat to separate those delicious coffee oils from the beans... they'll make you a perfect coffee every time.   I just wish they had a drive-through!  Meal  This place does serve freshly squeezed juices... but the coffee had me at .  Moving to the breakfast... it was alright, nothing spectacular,... I think the coffee built it up too much.  Kinda like when a friend hypes up a great movie and then... lame.  Have no fear though, the service is top drawer, and the atmosphere is rather ordinary, but still cozy.  Recommendation; Go for brunch before 11:30am. We arrive at 11:30am-ish and waited about 10 minutes for a seat. By the time we left there was line.   I just wish they had a drive-through!   Swan Restaurant Stop looking at me SWAN That is all for now"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on the suggestion of the mommy. They don't take reservations so we arrived at 10:45, and got the second last table. That would be my advice if you're not looking to wait.  Service was slow, but we weren't in a rush. Atmosphere was kitschy/hipster in a pleasant way.  I ordered the basic eggs. It was a LARGE portion, with two pieces of toast, potatoes, two eggs, and assorted melon like fruit. I didn't like the potatoes which was disappointing. I had ordered this breakfast especially since they reviews rated them highly, and I do love me some potatoes.  Overall I would say this was good but didn't blow me away. I'd try it again if Mommy wanted to see if I could find an extra star somewhere, but wouldn't go back on my own I don't think.  Brunch with a tea came to just under $20."}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff.  Good food with original twist. Eggs slightly overcooked. Overall a solid brunch."}
{"text":"Since moving to the Bellwoods area I have been trying out my new local food options. While I miss the likes of Chinatown, I have to admit, Swan has really compensated well.   I went there for brunch a few weeks ago and their menu was to die for. The Hangtown Fry was amazing. It consisted of smoked oyster and pancetta egg scramble. I never thought of Oyster to be a breakfast item but it blended well with the whole brunching experience.  The servers were super sweet and wonderful and although it was incredibly busy, we didn't feel the service lacked at all.  This place is definitely a worthy contender as a local."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Fresh when the Swan menu caught our attention.  So glad we decided to give it a try.  What a wonderful experience!  The wait staff was helpful--they seem to work as a team; the menu was interesting and creative and the food was delicious.  We started with the Alsatian sourdough bread with 3 dips; hard to tell which was best.  I had a vegetarian entree of beefsteak tomato with a mascarpone polenta.   So satisfying!   My husband had cod en papillote with fingerling potatoes and artichoke hearts with a preserved lemon sauce on the side.  So much flavor and such tender fish.  Unfortunately, we had no room left for dessert.  Next we hope to do brunch."}
{"text":"Excellent music on Wednesdays. Though, I find the food and drinks a bit overpriced. Good service."}
{"text":"There wasn't much on this menu that was pregnancy friendly (lots of goat cheese and deli meats) so I opted for the grilled cheese with pear.  It turned out to be a very good option because I'm pretty sure it was the best grilled cheese I've eaten...yes, ever.  We were served at a very nice pace and I liked the diner atmosphere. We scored a table easily on a Thursday morning, although I can imagine this place gets pretty packed on the weekends. I confirmed this with my dining companions, 2 Toronto experts.  The experts ordered the goat cheese omelette, which I'll have to get once the baby arrives. Then again not sure how I could not order the best grilled cheese ever?"}
{"text":"Swan is great - I've only been here for lunch but they serve very simple but delicious food.  I've never been disappointed.  I am confused by how quickly their espresso drinks get to my table.  It is truly remarkable."}
{"text":"I love Swan. It's not a greasy diner, but a place that does brunch, dinner and lunch  in a very unique way without ignoring the comfort food standard that a Diner should provide. Yes, the lineups can get annoying, but I try to come at off peak hours to avoid.  Their Bloody Caesar with fresh horseradish is my favourite in the city. They do Americanos (my go to caffeinated beverage) instead of brewed coffee. Oysters are freshly shucked and delicious. Hangtown Fry is a delicious scramble of oysters, eggs and spices. Speaking of eggs--- the eggs here are the freshest most delicious I've had in Toronto. Omelette secials are enourmous and bursting with ingredients. The multigrain bread from Sliversteins that they use for their toast is so nutty!  About this bacon absence. I actually kind of like it. *ducking and peering suspiciously for fear of being shot*. If forces you to have something different. The pancetta is crispy and salty-- just like bacon, but not nearly as greasy.  I'm not usually a salad girl, but they have this great one on the regular menu as well as the brunch menu. It's greens with Smoked Arctic Char, baby potatoes, cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced onions, avocado and a slightly creamy dressing. It's the perfect balance of flavour and texture. I've actually passed up eggs for this salad.  In m experience, service has always been keen here. I've visited at least once every six months over the last 10 years. I love the kitchy charm here and will be back again and again.  Happy Happy!"}
{"text":"Must-try: house-made salsa with banana peppers & ginger. Outstanding! Medium-hot and so good I found myself spooning it onto the plate and eating it all by itself."}
{"text":"An average diner for brunch.   Ordered the huevos along with coffee.   Nothing exceptional,  in terms of food,  but the space had a great vibe.     I've been here a few times,  and I've noticed little to no change in the menu.   Which is good if you're looking for consistency.     The service could have been a little better:  response times were poor,  but once you got their attention,  they got you what you needed."}
{"text":"Swan is a cute swanky retro diner. Walking in, it has an open, warm and welcoming feeling like you just arrived at a friend's place, and ready to embark on a good conversation with shouting and laughing.  The menu is simple which is another star. I ordered the oyster omelet, and my 2 friends ordered the Swan breakfast - egg + choice of sausage/ham + potato.  The portions are big! So come hungry .....or bring people that can help you eat.  I found the omelet to be a bit salty....the potato are good. Coffee is dark and strong, it's got a unique flavor.  None of us( 3 girls) were able to finish our food, which always makes me feel bad.  All in all, it is a cute little diner, not my type of brunch, but do not have anything against coming back either if someone were to suggest it."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, service not great but what was shocking is when we ordered their expensive  oysters, they prepare them very close to you, the kitchen is open. The man shucking kept dumping the juice inside out. We were stunned. The whole point of Oysters, it's pretty basic, is that you serve them still swimming in their juices. Unbelievable. Then our meal took forever to arrive. Over an hour, they forgot about us and the service was terrible and rude. Too expensive for this sort of behavior and will go elsewhere. Happily."}
{"text":"Out of all the brunch spots I've frequented recently, Swan serves up my favorite French Toast!!!!! It is quite the generous portion, but it just left me wanting for more. What I loved most was the strawberry sauce on top of the toast, which I think, skyrockets this classic brunch dish into super stardom. You can totally totally skip the maple syrup. More strawberry sauce, please!  I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and the wait time was no longer than ten minutes.  It is very old school; it's got that outdated look plus the original coca-cola freezer that has now been turned into an oyster bar.  I can't speak much on the coffee, but my mimosa was just what I needed!  I tried the Ceasar as well, which was extra piccante!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Brunch menu fairly straightforward. Came here early afternoon so we didn't have to wait to get a seat.   I had the salad w smoked trout (as they ran out of smoked salmon) greens, and new potatoes. The trout was nicely smoked. Enjoyed the creamy dill sauce that came with salad. Thought the dressing could have used some acidity or a bit more salt.   Boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs. Meat was cooked well still juicy and soft. It also came with home hash, toast, and some fruit.   Waiters were friendly. Enjoyed the Americanos we ordered. Pretty strong, but good coffee.   I'll be back to check out their other items. It has that old school diner vibe going on. Nice place to eat and hangout."}
{"text":"Strolling along Queen west on a beautiful weekend day amongst the hipsters is a good way to recover from a night of heavy drinking, and Swan is a great place to replenish your body.   With tasty brunches priced from $10-14, Swan does a good brunch. We tried the steak and Eggs and Huevos Rancheros, and I'd order either again.    The Huevos Rancheros had a perfectly cooked sunny side egg sitting a top warm flatbread and a delicious blend of tomatoes, onions and hash. Perfect for absorbing the previous night's alcohol. :)  The steak and eggs were good too, with the steak (a good piece, not your thin diner \"steaks\") cooked nicely (med rare).  All in all, a nice place to stop for brunch - I wouldn't say spectacular, but it's solid. Be warned that there does seem to be a bit of a wait though (but any place worth it's salt in Queen west has one)."}
{"text":"I went here as an alternative to Oyster Boy as it was fully booked.  The food wasn't good probably because they put this cream sauce over every dish... it was too much.  The price was also too much for the food.  You can pay the same price for a really good place, why go here just because it's hipster."}
{"text":"Swan is a restaurant that I've passed countless times on my way downtown via the Queen streetcar.  When I saw it on a list of top brunch places in the city, I knew I had to try it.  And last Saturday, my BCo (Brunch Companion) and I did just that.  The restaurant opens at 10am, so of course we were there to watch the sign flip.  We were seated immediately by a friendly server and given short menus.  I should say at this point that I enjoy trying things that are a little different than the norm - variety is the spice of life after all!  Seeing fresh shucked oysters on a brunch menu was surprising, but seemed a bit much for first thing in the morning.  Instead, I opted for the Hangtown Fry - scrambled eggs with oysters and pancetta.  Still different, but in keeping with breakfast.  My BCo had a coffee and the omelette of the day, which had sundried tomatoes, basil, and parmesan cheese.  Both orders came with a side of fruit and potatoes.    My eggs were nothing short of fabulous.  It looked more like an omelette to me, but I sure wasn't complaining.  Flavourful, good portion, lots of oysters and pancetta.  My friends actual-omelette was apparently delicious as well - we both suggested sharing, but got so consumed in, well, consuming that both meals were gone before that could happen.  I'm not the breakfast-potato aficionado that some people are, so I can't really judge the potatoes except to say that they were cooked well and had some seasonings.  But I always need ketchup on my taters, so I'm not the right person to ask on the subject!  Also, you should be aware that they don't brew their coffee by the pot.  It's actually Americano so they brew each cup on it's own - this means no free refills, and no small top-ups.  You either get a whole cup or none.    I almost forgot the best part.  How could I possibly forget - the hot sauce.  Oh, this hot sauce.  I wanted to take it home with me and put it on everything I ever eat.  A cross between salsa and regular hot sauce, it was the perfect addition to both of our egg dishes.  Hell, I'd almost put the stuff on French toast - that's how good it was.  Mmm...I'm having hot sauce flashbacks.  Service was friendly and prompt, and due to the small size of the restaurant, we could always get ahold of a server if we needed something.  I didn't notice too much about the décor, but I did see and love the old fashioned ice box they had behind the counter.  No idea if it actually works or what they use it for...but the mere fact that they had it was enough for me.    All in all, I really liked this restaurant for brunch.  I'd give it 4.5 stars.  Small menu, friendly service, daily specials, and AMAZING hot sauce."}
{"text":"This restaurant changed owners recently, as it used to be called the Swan by Rose and Sons. Now it's been renamed to the Swan 892. They've changed up the menu slightly under new management, but thankfully kept my favourites there with the Brussels sprouts and hummus, and avocado toast. It's retained the same laidback vibe, and now there's a cozy back patio too, which faces Trinity Bellwoods Park. With the nights getting cooler, the server offered us blankets without even asking, to keep us comfortable on the patio. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is the best I have seen so far. Everyone is really polite and very friendly and welcoming. Great stuff. The food is good as well, brussel sprout and hummus breakfast is super delicious! The hot sauce is very tasty, perfect blend of flavours. Also loved the ice coffee. Been here twice, great experience each time. Had the avo toast this time, it was okay pretty basic for 15. Otherwise love this place, get the hummus and brussels."}
{"text":"Stop looking at me SWAN! - Adam Sandler  I've tried to resist using this quote, but every-time I've walked by SWAN I couldn't help but imagine Adam Sandler sitting in a tub filled with bubbles, contemplating the importance of shampoo vs. conditioner. Thankfully the moment I stepped into SWAN, Adam Sandler bathing, became an afterthought.  SWAN boast three qualities: Large portions, creative diner/bistro eats and efficient service. Plus you can't help but love the roaring 1950s decor. Literally, everything is from the 1950s including the bartenders glasses...or maybe they are the ray ban's new generation. You'll never know with the hipster fashions.  Back to the decor and ambiance. Walking into Swan is a real treat (besides the crazy line ups and lack of room to stand). The peach & brown cozy booths with personalized hooks, the aging but proud varnished wood bar, the large coca cola cooler and the rickety silver vintage fan in the corner of the room, are tributes to the golden era with a contemporary punch. Before the current owners took over the space over a decade ago, she wasn't quite the white swan...but oh, how times have changed. It's a great place to come with friends to get cozy, by squeezing into their booths and enjoying a vibe of the 50s.  The Food. If you're hungry go to SWAN. Not only because the portions are massive but because you won't be disappointed by the flavor. The chef really likes to get creative with his dishes. Hence the oyster, pancetta omelet (SIDE NOTE: I've heard mixed reviews. My friend tried it and it wasn't for her).   I always go for the daily omelet and have yet to be disappointed. (I've also tried the Huevos and  The Swan Breakfast which are stellar choices) The best omelet I had:  Mixed mushrooms with spinach and brie cheese. I didn't want to share, which is a big thing for me...I'm usually asking the whole table to try what I've ordered, including the people sitting next to us. This one though, was just too good too share. The chef doesn't stop there. You have a choice of home-fries or salad. The salad is a mixed greens with a savory balsamic and the home-fries taste char grilled with a sidekick or charred onions. They also include a charred tomato with most of their dishes. For $10 it's a steal.  SIDENOTES: 1. Get there early. By 12:30P this place is jammed and you'll be waiting 30 minutes to eat. They're first turn around is usually around 12PM. 2. Service is incredibly efficient. Before you can even ask for something they've already brought it to you.  3. The servers seem a bit apathetic but thats just their thing, don't take it personally.  As its been said, I'm a bit of a brunch whore and it takes a lot to impress me. SWAN has rustled this hussies feathers and she'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I came here for breakfast as it was close to where we need to attend a workshop.  I've ordered the egg benny with lox. Absolutely did not enjoy it at all. The flavours were bland, I had to add pepper on it. The lox was not tasty aswell. Service was good.   But did not enjoy the food."}
{"text":"got the job done. fresh juice, good vibe, good benedict. nothing more nothing less."}
{"text":"Maybe my favorite restaurant in the city. Great brunch and great dinners. By far the best eggs Benny in the city. Small menu but the specials are always outstanding. I had a phylo wrapped halibut once that pretty much blew my mind. They always play great tunes; Wilco, American Analog Set, Sea and Cake, etc. and the staff are great. Caesars at brunch are outstanding. Coffee is amazing. I could go on. But I wont. I've already said too much."}
{"text":"Swan is casual, cozy and intimate. The food is always good and it's well priced.   I've been going for a few years and it doesn't disappoint. But I tend to forget about it and maybe don't go as much as I should!  I like the yummy salads and soups."}
{"text":"Food was EXCLELENT!  Huevos rancheros kicked a$$ and the sausages were delish!"}
{"text":"Judge a book by it's cover? Not here!   Don't be fooled by the non-exciting signage outside or the plain \"diner\" interior! This place was recommended by foodie & yelp elitist Natalie T., so I was prepared to be wowed by the food & service & atmosphere!  If it were not for the girls & I passing this way to attend another event down the street, I would not have discovered this delectable eatery!   SERVICE We arrived when it was still bright and sunny out (5:45pm), so it was easy to snag a seat. It was very thoughtful of the host-slash-waiter to give us the option of sitting where ever we pleased! Love having options! Secretly, seating is VERY important to me. I like - no I NEED - to sit where I can see the full view of the space!   It is evident at the start that the staff here are exceptionally friendly and very inviting! However, while the taking of our order was prompt, the delivery was veeeeery s-l-o-w! The appetizers was a decent wait, but we probably waited 45 minutes for our entrees! I'm guessing they didn't want us to feel rushed, as the staff did approach our table often or looked our way to ensure we were in good hands.    EAT THIS CRABCAKES    $10 -soft meaty crabcakes with a creamy sauce and a nice surprise \"kick\"! YUM! Tip: dip the soft freshly baked bread into the sauce! DIVINE! DUCK CONFEIT   $20 -juicy lean duck drumsticks with creamy heavenly whipped potato and crunchy green beans and white carrots! DELISH! And oh-so-filling!    AMBIANCE Although, I wasn't immediately smitten by the interior, as soon as the lights went low, and the candles were lit, the space magically transformed to a whole other setting! Cozy, intimate, and romantic! TIP: Not good for large groups. Come early or risk waiting! Bar seating on your right, and booth seating for groups of 4 on your left. Great place to get chummy with your date, or for small group shenanigans!   PRICE Affordable! Everything on the menu was less than $25 - average entree $20. Great prices for downtown dinner!  We were all first timers for DINNER, and now fellow fans! But apparently BRUNCH here is all the rave! So BOOKMARK it! ..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some Saturday brunch when in the area, and let with a full belly and a smile on my face.  I ordered the sandwich special which had peameal bacon, another meat I believe to have been pancetta, arugula, and cheese on toasted bread. Dy-no-mite! In fact I'd go so far as saying it was one of the best breakfast based sandwiches I've had in a while. My brunch date went with the Hangtown Fry (smoked oyster and pancetta egg scramble) and thought it was excellent as well. The interesting thing bout this breakfast is that the homefries looked pretty blackened and burnt, but actually had the perfect cookedness making for a great breakfast side dish.  On the service front, our waitress was on point despite the full capacity of the restaurant, including topping off water levels before the glass went dry each time which is something I find a lot of restaurants drop the ball on.  In the end, 2 orders of brunch and a glass of ginger ale came to around $26 after tax before tip, and I'd do it all over again if given the chance."}
{"text":"Swan, I love you.  Just went there for lunch. Easy to get a booth (although did pick up quite a bit by the time we left). Great casual atmosphere. Great friendly service.   I had a chicken club. BEST club sandwich I've ever had, with bits of bacon everywhere tossed in with the chicken, some type of yummy dressing, and green. Ugh..so darn tasty. The sandwich was huge, only ate half and was stuffed.  Cost? $10. I am so coming back here. I was looking at what other people ordered, the salads look awesome! So excited to find another favourite place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"A diner. No, scratch that. This is a hipster diner and it comes complete with aloof servers who don't seem super keen on serving you.   Be prepared to ask for the basics, like water refills and for them to take your order. The food is along the same vibe. It's ain't pretty looking (it is a diner after all) but it's tasty. My hang town fry promised oysters and it delivered, but only clumped together in a cornered cluster in the omelette style fry. A fried tomato (subbed in instead on toast) was delicious. Be ready for a peppery kick. Accompanying fried potatoes were good - but good people, when is a fried potato not good, I ask you?"}
{"text":"Lots of great reviews here and I'm not surprised.  I've eaten at the swan for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but mostly for lunch.  The place is hip, the food is consistently good.  I don't think I've ever had a bad meal.  The omelets are particularly good and I'm not even a big fan of omelets usually.  The oysters are also good but expensive (but hey, no surprise there I guess).  Overall the prices are pretty good, it's upscale diner with a small but diverse menu.  The staff are friendly but not overly so.  The bathrooms could use a reno.  They take reservations and if you plan to go on Sat morning and don't have one be prepared to wait, same at lunch if the weather is good.  But the turnover is fast and you can sit at the bar if there is room and eat or wait for a table."}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot, I usually get the huevos rancheros which are always good, I'm just not in love with the tortillas that they use. Their homefries are meh, but with ketchup they're pretty ok.  It's a nice spot if you're in the area and a bit easier to get into than other places nearby."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots for years. The beer braised ribs fall apart in your mouth. The decor is minimal and charming - one of my go to spots."}
{"text":"Your standard hipsters, slightly divey brunch diner. Went with the standard Swan breakfast for comparison.  Eggs your way, a well tossed slightly browned hash, interestingly accented with cumin seeds makes for a nice accompaniment. The toast is crisp and thin, and the half roasted tomato and honey dew slice round out a great plate. The pancetta was a slight bit salty and limp.  Overall, this place is a great small diner for brunch but not outstanding. The servers are great and attentive but limited seating makes the wait longer. No real tables for groups bigger than four.   They also serve fresh shucked oysters but I wasn't brave enough to partake. A couple patrons seemed to really enjoy a few fresh shucked plates with a crisp glass of white wine....maybe that's the ticket."}
{"text":"A friend recommended I go to the Swan for their weekend brunch, and I really enjoyed myself there.  The staff was very friendly, and their Swan Breakfast is a real winner.  They add many nice touches to their dishes that not only makes their food delicious - a definite must for a guy like me - but it also makes it stand out.  Instead of bacon, they offer pancetta, and a healthy portion, at that.  They marinate and grill tomatoes, probably the best part of an already great breakfast.  The place feels like an authentic, old time diner, with the circle stools in front of the bar, and wooden booths along the wall.  I would almost go as far as to say that it's a mom & pop type of shop, except that it's run by a group of late 20's, early 30's crowd.    Its location in West Queen West means it will automatically draw upon a certain amount of the gentrified masses, but luckily this didn't seem to matter.  My only real worry about Swan Restaurant before I went there was that I wouldn't be \"cool\" enough, but my silly fears were very quickly dashed.  Swan Restaurant is very much so a place to chill out and eat some good food."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing brussel sprout! Went there for brunch and I was very happy with the food. It was well seasoned , crispy and buttery. They also have a patio around the corner that's really cute. Staff are also very friendly."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go out of my way for this place. Did have quality food. Ordered the Reuben with potato salad. Both were made with care you could tell also pretty fillingl but for the price not sure was worth it."}
{"text":"Really confused. My partner and I go here often and live nearby.... ordered the avocado toast (which I had before and was excellent) which came out on White wonder bread (despite the menu saying sourdough) eggs tasted like vinegar and the avocado was tasteless. I'm not sure how you can mess up such an easy meal but it was dreadful. And cost something like 15$?!? I'm willing to pay that but it had better be good. My partners French toast came with lettuce?! Which was very confusing and unappetizing. Also overpriced. Service was very slow and tip machine set at 18 & 20% which also assumes great service.... just very very disappointing"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had the oyster po'boy as the only thing I like more than oysters are oysters that are deep-fried. Perhaps this was my mistake as I haven't seen it on any of the reviews and it was pretty low on the price scale ($12) but it was a huge disappointment. \"Po'boy\" brings to mind an abundance of fried seafood on a bun. I understand Swan is an upscale-type diner but what arrived were 3-4 oysters on a bun that were bland and basically non-existent. I'll echo other reviews that say the service was subpar as well. Basically, there's a ton of great restaurants in 2 block radius and I wouldn't bother with Swan again."}
{"text":"We go/used to go there quite frequently for brunch, also with friends and family, because we live in the neighborhood. It looks like recently the owner or at least name changed slightly but the food on the menu seems to be the same.   The Brussel sprouts with Hummus are excellent and I get them pretty much every time we go there. I was super disappointed however that you changed the bread without warning! Bring back the real bread, seriously. I don't like toast and if I pay $15 for a meal I expect more than that, especially becaue it used to be great the way it was! Please let me know when you serve sourdough bread again.  Service is always very fast and friendly and the ambiance of the place is nice, especially if you get a cozy booth."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to know about this place because of the signage, I mentioned it to many people and they are all like \"oh yeah, I've seen that place\".  Here's the jist: - they only seat you once the whole party has arrived - menu is kinda small - mussels in beer and onion is delicious or probably any soup base should be delicious - trout can be added to many meals and is tasty, but it's a small piece - for $3 though I'd say it's fair  I had the Breakfast Burrito, it was a special but really wasn't that special. This place was A-ok, but my socks weren't blown away."}
{"text":"I went to this place for brunch today with three other people, and I learned a lesson. Do: order the coffee, if you like coffee. Do: order the breakfast burrito, the shepherd's pie (although it was a daily special), or the potato salad. Do not: order the chicken club sandwich if you don't like dark meat. The cuts of chicken had gristle and cartiledge. It was a bit shocking because everything else there was absolutely delicious and well-prepared. But I know some people prefer dark meat chicken, so this may be why.   Other than that, the service was friendly and the atmosphere was great. Very classic diner with a hipster twist. I will go back."}
{"text":"theres something very neighbourly about having a restaurant dressed as a diner but filled with the pervasive smells and tastes of good food.  ive been here for very romantic dinners for which you might not expect it to be the setting, but its a wonder what dim lighting and a few candles can do for the swelled heart.    the pleasure of course didnt stop there, as the secondary purpose of romance is the swelling of the belly.  now i dont think this is anywhere close to the first thing id imagine if you said picture some food item named \"angels on horseback\", but the bacon wrapped oysters are awesome.  (id have to figure that whipped cream was involved or something light and fluffy...maybe a little quail atop a carrot?).  another goody is the smoked trout stack which has \"johnny cakes with chives creme fraiche and caviar\".  what else can you say but \"ooh la la\".  (and youll have to say that only when you see it because while youre eating it you wont be able to do much more than drool and breathe.).  finally (instead of ice cream?) you may want to get the braised beef short ribs which melt off the bone into your mouth like a basket flows down a river.  holy moses, batman."}
{"text":"Dropped by for brunch while walking on west queen West. Ordered the Swan breakfast which consists of two eggs, toast, home fries, and the option of pancetta or sausage. The eggs and pancetta were made well. The toast was lackluster, and the home fries were burnt and chewy. All in all, I wasn't overly impressed with what I had compared to many other brunch options available. My g/f got French today which was OK, but lacked that nice fluffiness you get from good French toast. It wasn't terrible, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is nothing special. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was a mess of stuff all piled on top of some bland potatoes. This can sometimes be a good thing. In this case, it was not. The best part was the side of melon.   I like the atmosphere though and the service was fine. Maybe it was an off day in the kitchen, who knows?  Word on the street is that this place has a killer brunch."}
{"text":"Been in for both Dinner and Brunch.   Dinner was pretty wonderful. I had the braised short-ribs and they were definitely falling off of the bone. A very healthy portion as well. Some friends of mine had the lamb burger and the Capon (castrated chicken, yum!) which they both liked quite a bit. Another friend had the fish of the day which I believe was trout but I might be wrong but it was definitely in cornmeal (that was the worst and least useful review sentence ever, I know). Anywho, he was happy with it but was envying our short-ribs.  For appetizers, we had the trout stack and the oysters wrapped in bacon and fried. Excellent choices and I encourage them to all of you. Bacon+Oysters, expectedly great.  Unexpectedly, the cocktails were pretty wonderfuil. There is no cocktail menu per se but the bartender said that they have all the \"normal ingredients.\" I played it safe and ordered a gin gimlet and was very impressed. Fresh lime juice, plenty of gin, no soda water....the way a proper gimlet should be. Although one might quibble with the no Rose's Lime Juice, I would tell that person to chill the f out.  Excellent and not crowded at all. Aside from the excellent bar tender, the waitress was very sweet although we did not catch her name.  Went for brunch a while ago. Excellent. Oyster scramble which was expectedly wonderful. Oysters+eggs, what could go wrong?  Very happy, will be heading back, and so should you."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the bartenders fun and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere is perfect. The vegan Reuben sandwich is delicious and the cocktails perfectly crafted. I highly recommended this for dinner and/or cocktails."}
{"text":"This classic diner with mid-century interiors is on point. Everything about Swan makes you appreciate life- lovely staff, tasty wholesome food and the fact that you haven't had to prepare or cook anything yourself! You're winning at life when you visit this place for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Walking down Queen Street West when we found this place.   The menu looked interesting, and the food was amazing.  Everything is homemade, and we had the burger, breakfast burrito and jerk chicken wraps.  My choice of the burrito, with bacon, avocado and black beans proved to be the perfect choice for a heart lunch,"}
{"text":"We were looking for more of a diner-feel for breakfast, so we picked Swan based on the Yelp reviews and descriptions.  It certainly is a diner with only a few booths and a counter.  After sitting, we were at first put off by the very limited breakfast menu.  My date is a vegetarian and was somewhat at a loss because the menu was mostly meat-based.   We were then surprised to find that they did not have simple coffee.  Just an espresso machine.  All worked out well because it happened to be delicious.  Despite our trepidation, we ordered somewhat blindly, hoping we made the right choice.  Based on our experience, I have a feeling that we could not have gone wrong with any of the menu items! My date, who rarely finishes an entire meal, pretty much cleaned the plate - it was that good! My breakfast sandwich was one of the best I've ever had.  I completely stuffed myself because I did not want to stop.    All ingredients were incredibly fresh.  The seasoning was perfect - lots of avocado flavor.  My sandwich had the perfect amount and type of cheese.  The Canadian bacon was lean and tasty.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Love the Swan! Really great food, excellent wine selection. Recently, it has gotten a bit of an attitude. A year ago, it was pretty much you show up, if there's a table, great. If not, you wait. Apparently they take \"Reservations\" now??! Seems a bit ridic. Staff have become a bit to hipper than thou, but the food is still brilliant."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. More of a three-and-a-half star than just three this place has decent food, looks like an old diner and has good service. Small so reserve, go early or whatever it takes. I had a the special burger which was great, very juicy and tasty. Soup the day, potato leek soup, was pretty good not amazing...  Needed an extra umph.  Pork chop I did not like it but I never like pork chops so it was a bad example of something to rate .. nonetheless I liked it more than other pork chops which usually I won't even touch. Gross who likes pork chops anyways. I'm doing booze free January so I can't rate drink selection. Do it."}
{"text":"Last time I was here, service, drinks, and food were phenomenal. I let the server recommend a dry white wine for me, and she chose well. My aunt and I shared the beet, walnut, and goat cheese salad to start, which was nice, although not very innovative (seems to be a pretty trendy salad for Queen West establishments). For dinner, I chose the daily special, which was salmon in a maple butter with a sweet potato hash. I'm generally not too fond of sweet-tasting entrées (I only ordered it because I was craving salmon), but I was honestly floored at how good it tasted. The sweet potatoes were seasoned and salted perfectly to complement the sweet, tender salmon. Otherwise, I absolutely love the feel and decor of this place... It's very laid back and old school diner-y. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This place has every reason to have the pretentious gag factor of about 100%; its location (Queen and Ossington), its trendy decor, and its nouveau food all seem to point in that nausea inducing direction.  But Swan is different.  Like many Toronto restaurants that stink of trying too hard, Swan's balance appears like it works without being tenuously held up by some greasy haired manager biting his nails in the basement crapper.  Swan is a very small place (so make reservations) filled with antique booths and a charming bar to match.  If you are up for only snacks I suggest grabbing some oysters at the bar and try their famous bloody Caesar - they put fresh horseradish in them.  Otherwise they have a fine selection of mains -- which I believe changes often and their weekend brunches are to die for."}
{"text":"This place was on my list for reviewing for a long long time.   We got a brunch there. Husband asked for a default omelette. It was AMAZING and HUGE, everything you would expect from a omelette, and MORE. It must have been made with SWAN EGGS - ha.   I decided to eat something lighter, otherwise I would fall asleep instantly, and asked for a salad. The salad was supposed to be spinach, nuts, goat cheese and a vinaigrette. They TOTALLY FORGOT about the nuts, and it only had traces of goat cheese, and the serving was so ridiculously small - I wouldn't even call it a side dish. So disappointing, specially compared with the amazing omelette my husband was having. I felt unloved.   If you go there, never, ever, ask for a salad. Go for proper diner food."}
{"text":"Gord and I had brunch today at the Swan Restaurant.  It's been in our 'hood about as along as we have but we've never been.  It's been a restaurant since at least the 1940s ... I like that they've kept the older furnishings.  You can get fresh mussels.  Damian, the owner, was shucking some  Gord ordered a Breakfast Burrito (with no avocado).  He said it was delicious and would get it again.  I ordered a Reuben sandwich (without sauerkraut or cheese ... so a smoked meat sandwich) and it was good.  The bread was lightly toasted and delicious.  The meat was hot and salty.  It was really filling and I'd get it again.  I also got a Diet Coke and it came in a wee bottle  Joanna was our server and took good care of us."}
{"text":"it's been around half a year since i was at swan (as a sort of celebratory dinner with my then-newly-minted wife), but it was such a pleasurable experience, i felt it merited a short little thumbs up here. tight, focused menu with an obvious knowledge of their stengths; intimate atmosphere with some nice, quirky decorative touches; & located on a beautiful stretch of queen st. west that offers plenty of sights for strolling if the wait for a table is lengthy (which it was for us). we went all out here -- bottle of wine, appetizers, entrees, dessert, the whole shebang -- & everything was superb & gorgeously presented. service was excellent & enthusiastic, & our waitress even bought our dessert (which we could not finish) as her own little congrats to us. if we have as wonderful a time on our next visit, they may deserve a full 5 stars (which i save for repeated superlative experiences). definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"VIBE  Your friendly hipster neighbourhood joint. If you want to people watch or find someone that lives in the Queen/Dundas nabe or you just really like Formica tables, this is probably your place.  I absolutely love to people watch here. Especially at brunch.  This time we came for dinner.  Service was friendly but slow. I think they were giving us time but they should have been a bit more assertive.   WE ATE  Dining companions had crab cakes and soup of the day.  The crab cakes were a bit crumbly but had some spicy sauces that gave it kick!  I sopped it all up with the bread (the bread here is FANTASTIC... so soft).  We moved on to duck confit, which at $20, is very reasonable for dinner downtown.  The meat fell off the bone and was very succulent.  No skimping of the mash potatoes or broccoli. Definite comfort food.   They help you with the wine selection and it went down smooth. Perfect for post-work tales.   We didn't have the oysters but I love the set up of it on the coca cola freezer. I am totally getting them next time, just so I can say \"on the half shell.\"   That said, I think I like their brunch selection a bit better. So dinner: 3.5 stars. Brunch: 4-5 stars. BUT you will wait in line for brunch. We also made a reservation and came early for dins.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  No ugly duckling here. (eh? EH?!)"}
{"text":"Swan is one of the major players on the Toronto brunch scene.  I finally had the chance to come here this past weekend.  We approached the restaurant a few minutes before they opened and they had diners eagerly waiting to come in, a great sign.  The diners decor is so dated but it works in a queen st west hipster way.  The breakfast plate is a great way to gauge any restaurant, and Swans is a little different than most.  First off they don't offer bacon, they offer pancetta, and weirdly capicolla.  I chose the smoked trout with a $3 supplement, but it was well worth it.  The fish was delicately smoked, and it was firm, but not tough.  The eggs and toast were standard, the addition of the broiled tomato was unexpected, and quite charred and smokey.  The potatoes are my favourite part and if they arent good, the whole experience is tainted.  The potatoes were reminiscent of a salt lick.  My sis also had potatoes with hers and she complained to our waitress about them, so she went to the kitchen and asked if they could do anything about it.  She returned with an excuse that all of the potatoes are made the same way and if they gave us any replacements that they would have the same level of saltiness.  This was slightly baffling considering we were the first guests, so how could all of the potatoes be prepared already?  Anyways, she suggested a side salad which was appreciated.  Another waitress first brought the salad to the table beside us, and than realized her error and put it on our table without a word.  I appreciate the solution however if felt very disingenuous.    Overall, Swan has a hip vibe to it but with the poor service and issues with our food, i doubt that i will return."}
{"text":"First time here and I love this place. Had the potato mash and the burger on the rye. Ervything. Was cooked perfectly. I will definitely come back. One of my new favourites on queen west"}
{"text":"Really delicious brunch! Not a huge menu but a great menu and as a pescatarian, loved that you could substitute bacon/sausage for smoked trout - so tasty! My friend had the rancheros...which was really tasty ..probably one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I almost didn't go because of the reviews about service here. Contrary to those reviews, we got very good service. And even better food. Our weekend lunch here was fantastic.  I had the Club House and my guy had the Breakfast Sandwich. I picked the best :P I loved my chicken club, with a mix of dark and white chopped meat, appropriate amount of spread, filled with leafy veggies and crisp pancetta. The club was completed with skewer quartered pickles and some of Swan's Moroccan Olives and cucumber slices (which were stolen by my guy). I'd say the weak point was avocado which ended up on only half of my sandwich. While the chopped meat made the sandwich hard to eat with my hands it helped keep the sandwich from being too dry as most clubs are made with dry white meat only.  I was a bit surprised at the lack of fries or side, but that sandwich is a complete meal. Fries have no place on my plate at Swan.  Get the club, thank me later.  Also how fast do their espresso drinks come out? Wowza."}
{"text":"Quaint spot with your typical diner offerings, plus oysters. Portions could be larger for the price and the menu items range from satisfactory to good. I've been a few times now and have had the Reuben sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, and shepherd's pie. \"Hipster service\" standards apply here - it's on the slow side even when empty, but friendly and attentive once you get their attention.  Generally, I expect larger portions at the same or lower prices, but I'm a big eater. I suspect that most will be fine with the portions served, and for that reason I recommend checking it out if you're in the King West area."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Easily my favourite resto on West Queen West (and competition *is* stiff!) that has maintained the same quality over the past few years: friendly service, cozy atmosphere, and tasty, tasty duck!  Cost: -$15-20 for brunch; $25-50 for dinner (tax and tip included)  Atmosphere/Decor: -Cozy (read cramped) diner with wooden booths, intimate lighting, and its own vintage Coca-Cola industrial fridge. -Always aromatically a pleasure to walk into from off the street.  Ordered: -I eat here semi-regularly and generally find all their offerings delicious!  Here are a few highlights:  1.  Duck!  This dish has gone through a few re-inventions each time I've order it, but at it's core, it's the same delicious duck cooked to juicy perfection.  It's hard to find places that do it right (let alone doing it yourself), and that's probably why I order this dish for dinner almost every time.  2.  Huevos rancheros: After three years, I finally had brunch here!  Be sure to be hungy because the portions are big.  Fried eggs in a tasty salsa black bean sauce with a good amount of kick is the true breakfast for champions.  Service: -Staff are always cheerful, friendly, and good-humoured.  Conclusion: -Eat. Here. Now. Or maybe you should try the rest of this strip first and save the best for last.  :)"}
{"text":"We stopped at The Swan just for cocktails, but it was really nice. The decor and lighting give the whole place a special cozy feel, sitting is mostly booths making this very image for a small group. The people working there were also very nice! Overall, I would recommend."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had been raving with love for this place for as long as I'd known her (though I hadn't known her that long), and during the summer I finally got to see what all the fuss was about. I had heard grand things about their burgers, but sadly, 'twas nowhere to be found on the dinner menu.  No matter. The aesthetics of the place are really cool (said friend, who happens to be a photographer used it as a location for one of her recent shoots), an old-school diner that serves much newer, lovelier food. I was very pleased with my spinach and feta risotto, as well as the watermelon and feta (and arugula, I believe. That or some potent, leafy cousin) salad- though, in contrast to the rest of my party, the bizarre combo had already been sprung on me at the Film Festival party last year. Old news, I say. Still very tasty, I also say.  I also got to witness- the first time, for such an act- another friend choose wine like a pro, tasting, sniffing, swirling them about in his glass and deciding on what we would drink. The results were very satisfying, though pretty much over my head. The point: a little swankier than I'm used to, which is a good thing, except for the fact that nights like that can't be repeated all that often (even in a lesser restaurant, it's usually appetizer, entree *or* wine, rarely all three). But I'm sure that when I finally move into those Candy Lofts, I will go there all the time."}
{"text":"Update- visited for brunch and was underwhelmed by the offering. Eggs were rather greasy, service was lackluster and my friends order was botched, with little recompense from the staff. Won't return.   Although the atmosphere (for dinner) leaves alot to be desired, the food was pretty good. Enjoyed the short ribs (house special), they were perfectly braised, fall of the bone, and served alongside mash potatoes, and some veggies. Definite repeat but probably just for brunch"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent ambiance, hooks for coats (I love these), and a breakfast that just won't quit. Located at Trinity Bellwoods Park, it's a good place to stop for some fuel when hipping it up on Queen West. I've only been for brunch, but they have a good selection at reasonable prices. I oughta head back for a dinner of oysters (courtesy Oyster Boy next door) sometime.  Obligatory Title Pun: You'll be TRUMPETING about this SWAN.  Menu Readability: Typewriter font, centred. Two thumbs up.  Need to mention: Did I mention they serve fresh orange and apple juice?  What this place teaches me about myself: I'm a sucker for anything freshly squeezed. (IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN)"}
{"text":"Did the owners change recently? This used to be a fantastic little spot south of the park with delicious food and unique flavours. Now it feels like a poorly run bar with mediocre food at best. The back patio by bellwoods is nice, but I won't be coming back here again for food. The steak and eggs was awful, and so was the avacado toast (which used to be fantastic here!)"}
{"text":"I seem to be coming here more and more for brunch. My girlfriend and I have made this place our go to brunch spot since anything we really like always has an insane line up.   While the dinner menu can be pricey, the brunch menu is actually one of the cheaper places to go to in the city. I've ordered the heuvos countless times (5) and getting the eggs scrambled is the way to go! Lots of good and the hot sauce is really good!   Coffee can be hit and miss, a few times it's been really good but lately it's been a touch bitter.   The wait staff are pretty friendly and it's a nice change from all the \"hip\" brunch spots we go to. 4 stars for the staff!"}
{"text":"My visit to Swan for brunch on Saturday was incredibly overdue in addition to being highly anticipated. Our server, Katie, had a wonderful smile and showed it often. She was attentive and friendly and the moment she rhymed off the day's specials I closed my menu and nodded quickly to indicate that that's what I'd be getting: a sweet potato, goat cheese and wilted spinach omelette (see pics!). YUM.   Our food took a while to arrive but Katie explained the reason for the delay and moments later, we were gorging ourselves on eggs and potatoes. The roasted potatoes are to die for - they're somehow boiled and then fried up with whole cumin seeds so they're sort of curried. The texture is incredible. There's also a whole grilled tomato on the plate that's really yummy. Would love to come back soon!"}
{"text":"I continue to explore all the brunch spots in the city and this is at the top of my list.  The atmosphere is like a small town diner with an intimate, warm feel.  The food quality is exceptional and consistent with ingredients that are perfectly matched to compliment each other.  The Huevos Rancheros, as an example, is layered with a perfect blend of fresh flavors and different textures.  Amazing - the best I have had.  The smoked fish is exceptional as is the coffee.  An unreserved 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Get ready to step into your fashionable Grandparents' basement. We went on a Saturday afternoon and only waited 10 mins. I had the hollandaise and my wife had the huevos. The eggs were perfectly poached. Caesars were respectable and brunch was just lacking a little salt, the Caesar however made up for that. No problem with service. Would like to come back for kitschy/cool raw bar plunked into the vintage Coke cooler at the end of the bar. Decent beer and wine list. Be ready to wait at peak times."}
{"text":"I like diners, oysters and booths so this place is OK by me!  Same-side boothing with a good friend should be a competitive sport in my books, and this place has some great seating. It looks like a diner, but it's a little higher end, both in terms of flavours and price point.   Fresh oysters, house-made soups for warming your cold loins and reasonably priced wine. Their menu is small and ever-changing, so if this sounds like your kind of place just get in here and check her out.   PEPPER POINTS for their old Coca Cola fridges and high end 50s decor."}
{"text":"Since the fine folks at Rose and Sons took over Swan, she's been a mighty dependable place for a casual dinner, a dozen oysters and a cocktail, and a cute back patio.   The old diner booths and counter are intact and as pretty as ever, so it's comfortable place to say the least. Menu faves include: Fried chicken, patty melt and their oyster selection."}
