{"text":"Great specialty pizzas, great calzones! On the pricey side for pizza, but quality and taste are superb, and staff is very personable!"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza and Service ever in my life. Waited over a hour for pick up after being told 20 mins and food was horrible. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"We moved to North Ridgeville a year and a half ago and were happy to find Uncle Al's. Nice to get a pizza that tastes nothing like pizza from the pizza chains. My favorite is the butter pizza. My kids and young grandson always ask for Uncle Al's when they come over for pizza!!"}
{"text":"We Love Uncle Al's Pizza. My kids, (10 & 14) always get excited when they find out that we ordered from them. Pizza always arrives hot, and tastes great. -Don't forget to order extra cheese!"}
{"text":"My wife loves the giro foldover an I am partial to the taco fold over!!  Always great quality!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst pizza i have ever had, never again. They shoild be out of business , lil ceasars is way better an that aint sayin much"}
{"text":"Just to be clear, the two stars are given based on the food. I grew up down the road from Uncle Al's Pizza. My family ordered weekly from this pizza shop. It was a family favorite for years. The cheeseburger fold over, taco pizza, and Pita BLT are incredible. They never changed the quality over the years. Which I love. However, the same cannot be said about the service.  Over the years, the service quality has decreased immensely. Opening hours are online as well as placed on the door.  You will be lucky to have the phone answered within the hour of opening. 
Openers are often late, do not pick up the phone for orders, and are rude when they finally answer. The last four encounters of placing an order have been disappointing. It as if the guys taking the order aren't paying attention. Repeating your order several times has become a garantee. They even get an attitude when placing a pick up order,  as if they are disappointed they have to actually work. 
I revisit based solely on childhood memories and the food. If I was a new customer, I would cancel my order based on the way the customer is treated. Again, that's only if you are lucky enough to get them to answer the phone in the first place!"}
{"text":"Used to be the best but last 3 times I have been there pizza is overdone.  Today is my last time - not happy with extremely overlooked pizza & girl at desk said she would not consider it burned & not nice about it.  SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great, the extra cheese pizza is seriously extra cheese. The hamburger and gyro fold-overs are also great."}
{"text":"I went in the Elyria location today for lunch with my co-worker. We arrived right around noon and there were about 4 people sitting down waiting on food and two women standing in line waiting for food. We walked up to the counter to look at the menu to place an order and noticed the man working behind the counter (young, dark long hair in a pony-tail).  He did not acknowledge us when we walked in and to be honest, never even made eye contact with us the entire time we were there. We waited over 5 minutes when we noticed he started slamming items around the restaurant. He threw pans, slammed cooler doors, threw things in the very back, then came up front and added mayo and ketchup to an item and literally threw both of the bottles across the table. At this point, we were afraid to even order. We looked around and noticed the two women were making the same faces and were making comments about his temper and how he was rude. Once he went to the back and started losing his temper again, we decided to leave and went next door to order food. While we were eating, we noticed two of the customers that were in there when we were, come storming out of the restaurant on their phones visibly upset. We came out as we were done eating and over heard them calling the police on the man inside. They had called at 11:20 a.m to pick up at noon and by 12:30, it was finally done but the pizza was burnt and there was a hair on the other item. They asked for their money back, the guy got mad, slammed $5 on the counter and told them to get the hell out of his restaurant. They left, he then came outside yelling at them..then  he went next door to convenient to get ice and locked the restaurant door. As we were leaving, another co-worker of ours said the man was in Convenient cussing and yelling about the people in his restaurant (upsetting children and other people at the Convenient store). We left because the man was obviously a ticking time bomb. If he truly is the owner of this restaurant, they will not be in business much longer. I cannot even say It was the worse customer service I've received because he never provided us any at all. What a jerk! We will never be back. The man that used to be there by himself was a sweetheart and will be missed. Horrible experience."}
