{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  Unfortunately, both the food and service were disappointing.  first the positives: The space is beautiful and the atmosphere is welcoming. The staff is friendly and is trying hard to do a good job.  now the negatives: the staff don't seem to have experience. Our hostess acknowledged that we were a group of five. She went to check to make sure the table was ready and then brought us to a table for four.  We were given only three menus. Eventually, she came back with a fifth chair but no additional menus.   Service was friendly but slow. The wait for our food was loooong.  Our server did acknowledge the wait but did not provide an explanation.  After our mains were served, no one came back to check on us.  We did not see our server again until it was time to clear the plates.  Three of the dishes were only lukewarm - we suspect they had been sitting out while the final two dishes were still being prepared. The other two dishes were hot but undercooked (open face hamburgers that had been ordered medium rare were actually closer to steak tartare).  We then had a long wait between asking for the bill and receiving it.    It may be that this new restaurant is still ironing out its kinks. For now, I cannot recommend this restaurant. The food quality is only average and the slow service is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"If I could rate this restaurant higher, I would.  The entire experience was sublime.  From the service (impeccable...friendly, knowledgeable, unintrusive), to the food (good lord...my friend and I just about fell off our chairs) to the decor and music - beautiful, understated and absolutely perfect.  I could not have asked for a better evening out if I tried.  This puts all other French restaurants in Toronto to shame.  I am so looking forward to going back next week (it was that good I need everyone I know to try it).  I couldn't be more thrilled that we have this calibre of restaurant finally opening in the east end.  I look forward to being a regular visitor!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for dinner last night. Service was very slow. We arrived at 6:50 and we didn't leave until 9:30. We had oysters to start and they were lovely. But the meal went downhill from there. My friend ordered the mussels and they were tasteless.  My main was steak frites. I ordered it medium well. It took a long time to arrive and we asked the waiter to look into it. His attitude was snooty.  He said I had ordered it medium well and that's why it's taking so long. When the steak arrived, it was rare. I asked the waiter to come over and look at the steak. I didn't bother sending it back.  It is a beautiful restaurant but the service and food are subpar. Save your money and go to Le Select or La Societe."}
{"text":"They're still getting their bearings (being new and all) but the service was friendly and the food was delicious! Sure, it's not cheap, but what finer dining restaurant is cheap?"}
{"text":"I live near this restaurant. Came here for lunch with a small group of friends and we all truly enjoyed our meal. The presentation of the food was wonderful and the tastes were excellent"}
{"text":"Not sure what people's problems are with this place, everything was on point.  Service: great, the server was knowledgeable, provided very good recommendations, was very attentive but not too present. The type of service that you really want from restaurants but they rarely deliver. She also timed the appetizers/main course perfectly so we weren't rushed nor were sitting around wondering when we would get our food.   Food: we ordered the fois gras to share, it was delicious, served with rhubarb jam/compote. For mains, we had the steak frites - cooked medium rare as asked and the fries were delish! Crisp, thin, well seasoned. Also ordered the steak hache, cooked to perfection, properly seasoned.   We had wine and beer - great selection of both, as well as a great selection of cocktails.   ONE thing I would add to the menu would be creme brule, as that is the one thing that was missing from our meal last night.   Also, Lynn Crawford came in for dinner last night and if she approves, I think that's a great sign.   Overall, the atmosphere was very french, relaxed, romantic, you could spend hours here, feel welcomed and continue to order wine. Definitely check it out and what a lovely addition to the east end!"}
{"text":"A great addition to the neighbourhood - full at 6:30 with prix fixe theatre goers for the Crow's Theatre next door. The service was warm & attentive. Blackbird Bakery baguette & salted butter arrives first. I opted for the Frisée aux Lardons to start (chicory, double smoked bacon, Banyuls vinaigrette, Benedictine Blue, poached egg $14). Delish. Then the  Steak Haché as a main course (ground beef brisket, fried egg, white anchovy, sauce bordelaise, on a toasted baguette $19) - #putaneggonit - I'm basically a sucker for anything with an egg on it. The chopped brisket was pan seared and fairly rare inside. Delicious, if a bit salty with the anchovy & jus. We shared the Cremeux au Chocolate for dessert - which was a salted dark chocolate ganache with sponge toffee on top of a chocolate chip cookie - and ate it so quickly I didn't take a photo. We'll be back for sure. Great place to bring visiting parents as well."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment pre theatre to see Jerusalem.  Awesome food, great selection and the Ole, Ole, Manhattan was incredible.  The French onion soup, steak and delicious crème brule was to die for.  Ambiance by the road great view, super staff.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Run - don't walk, to anywhere else. The drinks are watered down - pretty easy to tell when you are a seasoned grey goose drinker. Our food was awful, the server did not explain the specials or the oysters properly so we were ill-informed when we ordered. The place was empty and in a high density hood this place could easily be packed every night. Head south to Queen St. for an array of better options."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not like others in Leslieville.  By that I mean the attitude and vibe is fussy and not that all that welcoming.   The food is fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed the plates and plates of food we ordered. The French onion soup looks amazing. However, dining is about the food and overall experience.   Our server was friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable, however I'll just say that the vibe from other staff members was not the same. It was a quiet Monday night as well.   I don't think I would return here when there are so many restaurants on Queen that deserve a visit."}
{"text":"I remember this corner from the 1990s. A United Church minister, Al Reeve, came here to work as a minister without a church, and he tried to organize the local businesses to serve the community. Now it's a bustling community, and this restaurant is one sign of the bustle.  I like the food and service here as much as anyone.   But the thing I find inspiring is how Business to Busines (B2B, as it's called) helps make the area sing. The restaurant benefits from the theater by providing a nice place to dine before a show, which people like to do, and the theatre brings people to the restaurant. It reveals sound local economies as an outgrowth of \"the whole is greater than the sum of the parts\" principle.  B2B is at least as powerful as the old concept of the multiplier effect, which is just about how your money jingles in many pockets before it leaves town.  B2B means every bite you ate created direct work in the local economy, and each of the businesses helped generated its own multiplier effect. Gare de L'Est buys its bread from a great Kensington bakery, Blackbird, and sells a lovely artisanal beer called Burdock. This is nice for a French restaurant because it shows they have a sense that the style and cooking tradition can be French, but the ingredients local. After all, the essence of French cuisine is to rely on fresh and seasonal ingredients -- so B2B is built into their culture.   In North America, we still have to create that culture and do that with an economic motivation. B2B is the vehicle for creating that culture.  As Keynes, the great economist used to say \"Trade the recipe, make the shortbread locally.\""}
{"text":"Food was just OK. My French onion soup had caramelized onion mixed in with several pieces of hard, semi-cooked onion. I had the duck breast entree and was expecting crispy duck skin but instead it was soft/rubbery. The white legume melange served with the duck was the same deal as the onion soup: some beans were soft/tender while others were still firm with a hard skin. The side of potatoes au gratin was creamy but bland.   Service was very polite throughout the night but a bit slow. There was an issue when it came to the bill. It was a large group dinner and two bottles of wine were shared at the table. The bottles were supposed to be split evenly between our separate checks but for some reason some people had two bottles on their bill while others were only charged with one. I got charged with two bottles which was ironic considering I never drank anything (I was DD). Perhaps it was my bad to assume the server would know not to charge me since she never offered me wine all night and never filled my wine glass, only my water glass. I brought this to her attention and showed her how some of us were unevenly charged but all she said was it's really hard to split a bill amongst so many people so I never got my issue resolved. Somebody else at the table also had discrepancies on their bill in addition to the uneven bottle charge.   The decor is beautiful inside but the acoustics travel a lot. It's extremely loud when the restaurant is full, you can't have a quiet dinner here. I recommend going for a very early or very late dinner if you want to be able to have a dinner conversation.  I imagine breakfast here would be very nice but based on the food and service I experienced, I feel there's some catching up to do with Le Select Bistro or La Societe."}
{"text":"I wish I came here during the day because the area seems really nice.  My BF and I had reservations at Gare De L'est for 9 on a Friday night. We expected to order from the prix fix menu, because according to their website, it is available. BUT, turns out, I really cannot read French despite learning it all throughout middle school and high school. The prix fix menu is only available if there is some showing at the theatre next door.   The service was amazing! I don't remember having such amazing service before. Everything was prompt and the waitress was really friendly. The atmosphere of this place was also amazing and super bougee (is this the correct spelling?), which is my favorite kind of atmosphere.   I love onion soup, so I ordered the onion soup along with the canard (duck). My BF ordered the pate de campagne and the stek frites.   The onion soup was super sweet. I've never had such a caramelized SWEET onion soup before and the whole thing was kind of loaded with either red wine vinegar or just red wine. I think this was the most flavor intensive onion soup I've ever had, and it wasn't such a good thing. The red wine was really overwhelming, as well as the sweetness of the soup. The duck was kind of a let down for me. I thought the skin would be really crispy, but it was just OK. If I ever came back, I would definitely not order the duck again.   My BF's dish was okay. He really enjoyed the appetizer, but he also felt like he ordered wrongly for the main. He was served a tiny tiny piece of steak and an overload of fries. He asked for medium rare, and it looked more rare than medium rare to me, but he said it was medium.   We ended up ordering the trio of profiteroles for dessert and that tasted really good. The cream inside was really vanilly and tasty, and the puff pasty melted in your mouth.   Anyway, not a lot of negative of positive thoughts for this place.   TLDR; Nice atmosphere, great service, but the food wasn't as special as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying French food is not my favourite so I'm a bit biased here.  I've been here twice now as it's close to where I live.  French food in general is very rich and buttery so you tend to leave here feeling like you'll have a mini heart attack.  I've had the daily specials and the duck which is a very nice portion (breast), but a bit on the salty side.  I'll add that the french onion soup is one of the best I've had.  Service is excellent.  I tend to stop by in the morning for coffee and pastries.  In Toronto I've done La Banane as well, which has better execution and taste, but not necessarily worth the hassle and crowds.  I'd say Gare de lest is a 3 star resto in the core/west end, but a 4 star resto in the east."}
{"text":"Went for a pre-theatre drink but got to order dinner - same menu in bar & restaurant, I believe.  Lovely spot, a bit fancier than my idea of \"brasserie\". A terrific steak/frites and the Champignons Bourguignon is an unusual dish,  rich & delicious -- richer than I'd expected, I could have gone more full-bodied with my wine choice to stand up to it.  (also could have used some bread to soak up the sauce - no baguette on offer, seems \"un-brasserie like\"?)   A short but delicious wine list and I got a good recommendation for what I said I wanted.  Not cheap, not too expensive. Extremely comfortable to sit and to talk on the bar side at least.  And what a great one-stop when going to Crow's Nest Theatre!  Even got free on-street parking!   Service was good.  Hope to get back."}
{"text":"This is a review for the pastries sold in the morning.   I was excited to try out GDL and picked up an almond croissant. The croissant seemed old. Parts of the croissant were stale and other parts were gummy. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was decent and expected. There wasn't any food that was a stand out. It is a typical brassarie at Toronto pricing. I found the service and pace to be slow, but friendly. The staff seemed green and still trying to get their bearings. I expect it to improve with time, but at the moment, it's not at the caliber that one would expect.   The slow pace and lack of service was not entirely the staffs fault, the management/leadership was absent. I watched the manager and she did very little to give direction to her staff to improve the situation. I don't know why she was there."}
{"text":"Gare de l'Est Brasserie is a newcomer to our Leslieville neighborhood, but already a vastly popular spot. It tends to be full when there is a theatre performance and consistently hums with life throughout the day. MUST HAVE: Bread Pudding dessert  -  Check out our full experience review for more juicy details!"}
{"text":"Best. French. In. The. City.   Service:  Attentive  Personalized Personable staff Knowledgeable  Efficient   FOOD:  Thoughtful & Crave-able (find myself craving particular menu items)  Well timed (everyone at the same time)  Piping hot  Perfect execution   STARS OF THE SHOW:  Coq au Vin--best I've ever had  Soupe À L'Oignon Grattinée--see above  Chicken Liver Mousse--brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it  Steak Tartare--perfection  Champignons Bourguignon--an earthy, sexy, comfort-food-y delight. Excellent flavours.   BAR GEMS:  Vieux Carré--lovely, if like myself, a Manhattan is your go-to  Aperitif Classique--think patio or long, leisurely brunch; or both  Vignerons de Buxy Montagny 1er Cru  Guigal Crozes-Hermitage (delicious Rhône blend)  If food can be an emotional or spiritual experience for you, Gare de L'Est should be at the top of your \"to try\" list."}
{"text":"The service was very good and accommodating.   Saturday night and it was full.  Make sure you make reservations.    I had the French Onion soup which was okay.  It was very hot (temperature) but the broth was way too sweet for my liking.    I did enjoy my mussels.  A huge portion in a very nice simple broth.  Very tasty.    And my Decaf Americano was perfect.    I liked this place and will try it again.  The soup was the only disappointment."}
{"text":"We had a lovely Saturday night dinner here and really enjoyed it. The service was excellent. All of the dishes were really good. Since there were four of us, we got to try many dishes and many wines, and all were great. The highlight for me was the Plat du Jour, which was Coq Au Vin with French Gnocchi -- exquisite with an excellent, rich sauce. Desserts were all very good as well. So glad to have a good French Bistro in the east end."}
{"text":"This review is a bit delayed (ate here back in summer of 2017) so hopefully things haven't changed too much. When I reserved it, I chose the counter stools, which gives a great vantage point of the kitchen and the preparation that goes into each dish. I loved watching this as part of the dining experience so would suggest it if you don't mind a bar stool and being part of the busy-ness of the resto.  The dishes I tried were:  SOUPE À L'OIGNON GRATINÉE Good size and the presentation was nice.  HUÎTRES Oysters are standard everywhere.  STEAK FRITES Cooked well, good portions and fries are yummy.  CHAMPIGNONS BOURGUIGNON This is originally what drew me here as it has mushrooms, egg, pasta. Very simple ingredients but my favourites. This is the one that I would come back here for.  It also came with a sourdough baguette from Blackbird Baking (which is a great bakery in Kensington). Hopefully they still offer that as part f the meal. Overall, I will likely be back. The decor is nice, the value is there (e.g. not super expensive), and the experience was very pleasant!"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty average. We had the beets, lardon salad, steak tartare, oysters, mussels, schnitzel and steak frites - which was supposed to served with a green peppercorn sauce but instead came with a nasty, syrupy sweet red wine reduction, same as the schnitzel.  We brought this mistake to our waiter's attention and he promptly removed it, then replaced it with the exact same sauce, proclaiming it to be the green peppercorn sauce... it definitely wasn't, not a peppercorn to be found. I would have understood if they told me they were out of the sauce, but don't try to fool me by saying something is what it definitely isn't. Neither the waitstaff or the management seemed to be knowledgeable of classic French cuisine or concerned enough with correcting the mistake. Obviously not well versed in \"the customer is always right\" or at least trying to make the customer happy, especially since our bill was well over $400. Based on my experience I can not recommend this restaurant. There are far better French bistros in this city with loads better food and way less attitude."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Tried this new restaurant with high expectations -- we are big fans of Ascari Enoteca. The space is lovely, with large windows out onto the street. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Our meal started with huge chunks of fresh baguette and whipped butter -- two of my favourite things. We ordered the foie gras as an appetizer, and it was very good -- two good-sized discs served with a yummy rhubarb compote. However, the menu says it comes with grilled bread, and we did not receive any. Good thing we had some baguette left. For mains, we ordered the steak frites, the pork cutlet, and the mushroom pasta. The pork cutlet was the highlight -- crispy and seasoned just right, served with some greens and a delicious potato salad. I would come back for this dish. At the other end of the spectrum, the steak was underseasoned and disappointing. It almost tasted gummy. The fries were lovely, however. Finally, the mushroom pasta had absolutely wonderful flavours (I think I moaned after my first bite), but was undermined by the undercooked poached egg on top. The runny, slimy egg whites completely turned me off. I would order this dish again, but I would ask for the egg to be cooked a bit more (or left off entirely). We finished with the lemon tart, which was a lovely lemon curd and tiny meringue buttons served in a slightly tough pastry crust. Overall, our experience was decidedly \"just OK,\" with some highlights. However, those highlights were quite impressive so I will return to give this spot another try."}
{"text":"A brasserie is at it's core a simple and casual place.   An unpretentious spot to enjoy great food and wine in an upbeat environment.  A place for the neighbourhood.  A place that's alive.  They got this perfectly right.   Pair that with a no-filler menu of superbly put together classic French bistronomy.   This is not a place of experimentation, it's a place where the tried-and-true shines.    A place where they get the bread and butter absolutely right.    That's not all.  It's the small touches.   It's the way that all of the wait staff utilize French phrases as interjections.    It's the way the angled dining room creates moments of urban bliss as the headlights of passing cars gleam in creating a sense of movement and moment.   It's the way the glass doors open up into the theatre next door creating a seamless connection and inviting the world in.    Ten years ago, if I told you that one of the most exciting corners of Toronto was becoming Dundas and Carlaw your jaw would drop in shock.       Now as the city grows, this is the perfect compliment to what's becoming a magical neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, service, and food. Had no preconceived notions going in. Didn't know that this place was owned by the same people that were behind Ascari. But, this place is exactly what the east end needs. The highlight for me was the wine list. Like Ascari, it was curated nicely and well thought out. The one thing I would love to see is a real French style burger on the menu. Then this place would be epic."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner tonight for my wife's birthday. My uncle had the breaded pork cutlet (looked amazing), my wife had the Steak Frites (she doesn't usually order steak but raved about this dish) and I had the chicken (fabulous). Everything brought to the table was nothing short of spectacular. Our waitress was great, she checked on our meals, our drinks, our desserts etc ... and didn't feel like she was over-crowding us ... just right!  The atmosphere was inviting, and the space is just right. Not too big and not too small ... just right.   Whether you're out for a show at the Crows Nest or just a night out .. give Gare De L'est a try!!!"}
{"text":"First things first: the best thing about GDL surrounded the food itself. GDL absolutely looks the part of a semi-upscale restaurant - somewhere to take your date, or your family for a nice night out (as in my case, for my mother's birthday).   The food itself, however, is thoroughly average. Of the 6 items we ordered, only two were, in my estimation, worth the price: a spectacular arugula salad, complete with a vinaigrette dressing and rhubarb and the coq a vin.   Otherwise, most of the food was either subpar or fairly standard.   We ordered the mussels, which were oh-so-close to being great - but which fell short of expectations. Many of the diners that we observed ordered the same dish, surely for the same reason we did (it looked really cool on other people's tables).   The French onion soup, on the other hand, was good as a dip to accompany the complimentary bread. But that was precisely the issue: if eaten the way it was intended, it was too salty and too sweet.  Sure, GDL has some potential. Much of its appeal comes from the vibes - which combined with the strong service, do indeed help its case. But when it came to its food, I was left mostly wanting more."}
{"text":"the spring salad special was all fall ingred. but for rhubarb. inattentive waiter w. hairy chest above the second button had that old-school shade thinking his service was a favour.  no specials until asked for. tough schnitzel!, undercooked, bland, acid-less potato salad, over-reduced salty something sauce. packed. i've experienced better other occasions."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night, and the service was attentive and fast. The food was good, a decent balance of taste and presentation. Knowing they are trying to serve traditional French style cuisine to a diverse market, it was good. However, if you're looking for something with more creativity and flare, you won't find it here. Between the oysters, mussels, fish and steak, it was at best \"good\" but lacked any real distinction and lasting culinary impact. I would go again to try something different. Lacked a 'wow' factor."}
{"text":"I can't possibly understand some of the reviews here. This place was fantastic. Went here on a date. Sat in the chef's table nook. Great service. Food was upscale french and terrific. Hands down one the best places I've been on the east end. I guess the biggest downside is the $ is high, but nothing crazy for what you'd expect at fine dining."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant.  Chicken dish was succulent and we'll seasoned.  The mussels were plentiful and the broth was good, not too salty.  Only disappointment was the wine.  Very overpriced."}
{"text":"Let there be light!!!  To the barren northeast corner of Carlaw and Dundas come Gare De L'Est!  The team behind Table 17, Ascari Enoteca and Hi-Lo have done it again.  Less than a week after opening, and on a Wednesday night no less, the place is popping.  Jazz, conversation and the sound of knife on plate accompanies great French fare.  Yes (!) to the beet salad - an elegantly presented fast explosion.  Yes (!) to the chicken, but order to share as it surely isn't small.  Most diners seem to be dressing up a little, but get in here and say yes (!) to the delicious baguette to get the party started!"}
{"text":"I lined up at the door on a weekday evening. I was studying the poster of France at the entrance for 10 minutes and the maitre d was no where to be located. However I did have eye-contact with a female bartender and a waitress while I was waiting. The restaurant was 70% full. I saw some empty tables both in the dining room and the bar area. Oh well, next time perhaps."}
