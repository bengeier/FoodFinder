{"text":"It's like Schwartz's but with better smoked meat (and Karnatzl's) and worse hours. Much better smoked meat. Much worse hours."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich had good flavor. Unfortunately it's about the size of my fist, soggy and very very very overpriced. The service wasn't spectacular. I only had time for one deli during my trip, I'm sorry I chose this one."}
{"text":"What a gem. This place would be 4 star for sure but it's pricey for what you pay for.  I arrived here at Lester's Deli around 9am on a Monday morning. So yes... They serve smoked meat sandwiches that early, even on a mother effing weekday. Take that, Schwartz! #CLUTCH. I had to swoop a few up to-go before embarking on a greyhound bus that what would become a well over 9 hour ride back to Boston.   The sandwich is delicious, but I must say I prefer the joint on St Laurent. Always go for double mustard. Who could ask for more than a smoked meat sandwich with pickle and cherry cola for lunch on a dang bus while stuck at the border for 3 hours? I spoil myself.  -Bean"}
{"text":"I ordered the meat medium which means it's sliced from the middle section of the brisket where you get the perfect slices of beef that are both lean and fat. The meat is moist and the fat is not intrusive. We have it programmed in our heads to stay from fat like... it was fat or something. But in this case you need it; the fat stays soft and doesn't eat like hardened gelatinous snot. But even if it was, it'd be the most delicious kind. The fat is where the flavour is and that is where it's at."}
{"text":"Lester's is a decent alternative to the other place if you can't be bothered with the long wait. The smoked meat is above average. Also ordered the smoked salmon and poutine. Smoked salmon was really good. Came here with my family. They gave my kids toys to keep them entertained and happy. They even hung out with is giving us the fake mustard treatment.   Overall very friendly place. Easy to communicate (English) and good  alternative for smoked meat if you can't wait for the other place. Oh the decor and plethora of old things on the wall was cool"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a native Montrealer who lived for years on the plateau and Outremont which by default makes me an expert when it comes to smoked meat. Whenever the craving hits, I head for Lester's and have been doing so for over 40 years. By far, this is the best smoked meat (and fries) in Montreal, period. Billy along with his family and crew are gracious and friendly hosts and it's always delightful to see them.  If a late night snack is what you want, the second best is the Main Steakhouse on Saint Laurent and Schwartz's is way, way down on the list."}
{"text":"Très bon mais beaucoup trop cher.  Plus de 18 $ plus tip pour un sandwich, une frite et une boisson gazeuse ça me semble très exagéré.  J'ai aimé la nourriture. Mais ça va prendre un bout de temps avant que j'y retourne."}
{"text":"It's fun to go to a deli once in a while..Lester's has that great diner feeling and the service is quick and efficient! The food is good and is what it is expected to be..However, unfortunately, it is WAY overpriced!! Great cherry cokes too:)"}
{"text":"Not worth the price.  The smoked meat is not as good as Schwartz's or The Main.  The poutine was worse than average.  And our server was downright rude.  However, the cashier was much more pleasant.  Overall, a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"On our first trip to Montreal, my husband and I knew we had to try smoked meat sandwiches before heading home. We had just finished a private neighborhood tour and our guide said she thought the flavor of the meat at Lester's was superior to Schwartz's. We took one look at the absurd line at Schwartz's and hopped in an Uber up town to Lester's. So glad we did. We were seated immediately. We ordered the classic sandwich with a side of pickles, a Canadian cherry soda (so much better than cherry Coke!) and a frosty Quebec beer served upside down in a frosty glass. Everything was delicious. Pickles were crispy and briney, and the meat was moist and flavorful and piled high in the sandwich. The best part of it all? Billy, the proprietor! He warmly greeted every single guest, made room for everyone, and stopped by each table to check in. He was funny and kind and clearly hardworking out of passion for his establishment. Do yourself a favor and skip the line at Schwartz's... Lester's is the place to go for locals and tourists alike!"}
{"text":"went to eat for lunch on a Monday, food was ok, Ive had better smoked meat at Georges deli on st martin blvd, the place is run down and really needs renovation,its truely over rated."}
{"text":"Lester's is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has been there since 1951. They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside.   The smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite stops in Montreal.  The smoked meat was perfect.  The fries were great, and the prices were reasonable.  We went on a weeknight and there was no wait and the food came out quick.  I completely disagree with the people complaining about the service.  The server was wonderful and did everything she could to appease our crying baby.  In fact, when we hurried out early in our meal, they asked us to stay and finish.  As new parents, we appreciated that.  Even the man behind the counter came to speak with us.  I was a big fan of the throwback deli feel of the place.  I'm not a smoked meat expert by any means, but Lester's was an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Smoked meat is great but their best kept secret just might be their chicken burger, maybe one of the best sandwich in the city  Plus the owners ate very nice"}
{"text":"The smoked meat here is excellent and moist.  It almost tastes like it's been cooked sous-vide (which obviously it hasn't, but it has that texture.)  The vinegary cole slaw is excellent.  The service is good.  My only warning is the primary flavoring for the meat here is clove: much more clove-y than its competitors.  If you do not like clove, this is not the place for you.  If you do, it's one of the top options in the city."}
{"text":"This is the best place for visitors to try Montreal smoked meat sandwiches and other, deli favorites that are unique to Montreal- pickles, mustard, and karnatzel.  They sell vacuum packed smoked meat for travel back to the US.  Lester's has that unique Montreal Jewish deli atmosphere, complete with very friendly service.  (Thank-you, Sybil.) It is a bit tough to find but that is part of the charm.  It is in a neighborhood that is about 2 miles from Centre Ville.  This makes it genuine, and not touristy."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat. Great fries. The pickles make you wince. The Cott black cherry is plentiful. There are also many beautiful parks nearby in Outremont to walk it off!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why dumb tourists line up for hours at Schwartz while you can get smoked meat and brisket that is just as good or better... here at Lester's. I literally got my sandwich in like 2 minutes.   This place is in the heart of Outremont. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Le 2ème sm restaurant de Montréal.bien entendu non casher,malgré le voisinage .terrace.serveuses d'un autre siècle proprio omniprésent sm/frites qui font fa fierté de Montréal.licence.on aime et on partage avec les amis"}
{"text":"It had been nearly 40 years since my last visit to Montreal. With a clear  recollection of the fuss made over smoked meat, I needed to check it out.  So a Google search of best smoked meat got me to Lesters for lunch.   Sat outside and ordered smoked meat sandwich.  Wife had a bagel/smoked salmon sandwich. The smoked meat sandwich was amazing.  This is not just a variation on corned beef or pastrami.  The flavoring, tenderness and overall scrumptious sandwich was unique.  My wife got quickly tired of my kvelling over how good this was.  Sadly she wants to try many other Montreal food choices.  I would be happy just to go to Lesters."}
{"text":"Although this great deli is a hike from the Outremont metro station, it was a delightful walk through a nice neighborhood. And what a delicious treat awaited us when we finally arrived! Don't let the lack of ambiance scare you away; this is a small Jewish deli that has been in the same family for 62 years. Not large, but cozy.  The smoked meat on rye is what this is all about! Add plenty of delicious pickles, perfectly cooked fries, and a cold beer and you are in heaven! Took the 80 bus to the metro and got back to our downtown hotel in no time. Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I thought it was all great until I got to the cash register. $19 for a smoked meat sandwich, a very small order of fries, a pickle cut into four pieces and a mediocre coffee? SERIOUSLY?"}
{"text":"Went to Schwarz yesterday....Lesters today  So no real comparison....   Meat at Lesters much more tender..bread better.  I wish I could eat this once a week  Cole slaw....fabulous   Oh.   No waiting   Go to Lesters...enough said."}
{"text":"When it comes to Montreal smoked meat, Schwartz's seems to get the most publicity. Lester's is far better in my opinion and is a much friendlier experience. It's a family business that treats their customer's like family. The smoked meat, brisket sandwich, club sandwich and all the sides are second to none. Next time you want smoked meat, you should definitely give Lester's a try."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy Thursday afternoon. Not sure if it's like this all the time, but it was mostly empty, which I was perfectly fine with. Nice not to have to wait for a table and/or share a table with strangers (though sometimes I don't mind).   Lester's is stacked with charm, from the hand-painted lettering and signs outside, to the walls full of antique things and signed celebrity photographs. The staff greeted us like we existed (some places literally treat me like I'm invisible), so that alone was a treat.   We weren't super hungry, so we shared the smoked meat plate, which quite simply is a pile of smoked meat, all the rye bread you want, pickles, and mustard. Added some fries and gravy to that and we were good. I'd probably say Lester's is near the top of my favorite smoked meat. Juicy, flavorful, and satisfying.   I definitely plan on coming back when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"If Schwartz is your standard for smoked meat in Montreal then there is no reason to choose Schwartz over Lester's. No wait whatsoever, you step through the door and the owner immediately greets you and seats you. He's funny and enthusiastic and will get you seated so that the smoked meat can reach your table ASAP. Much roomier than Schwartz, you won't be packed in like farm animals. Decor is also better.  But instead of comparing it to others, on it's own, Lester's Deli serves delicious smoked meat. The meat in the sandwich is extremely soft and tastes great. Smoked meat poutine is also very good but personally I'd probably eat two smoked meat sandwiches myself.  Also a big plus - takes credit cards! And you can take vacuum sealed meat to go!  You won't regret coming here."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum.  A great, authentic alternative to waiting in line at the greatest tourist trap of all, Schwartz's! (Don't get me wrong, they make fantastic smoked meat, but I'm not down with the line up and exaggerated hype) Bernard is also one of my favourite streets to stroll on, it just has so much to offer. Start off with a coffee or a bite to eat, then grab an ice cream and people watch. Especially on a beautiful, summer day, you just can't go wrong.  The traditional smoked meat came out soft and not-so-fatty. The rye was fresh and fluffy. The fries were AH-MAH-ZING, especially drizzled with some vinegar. And you can never forget the side of a good ol' pickle. I didn't opt for the Cherry Coke, I know... my b. The service was fantastic and so accommodating, our waitress even offered my dog a little bowl of water and tons of love and affection. We sat outside and just enjoyed the wonderful day that it was, while the outstanding service and finger-lickin' good food topped it off marvelously.  Heaven in your mouth, go for it."}
{"text":"I compared Schwartz's and Lester's.  Lester's is much better.  I gave Schwartz's two stars.  Here is my review under Schwartz's, but it works as a review for lester's too:  I'm was a Montrealer for 40 years, and I'm now an American.  I hadn't had smoked meat in about 10 years.  I was visiting Montreal for work, and on consecutive days I ate at Lester's (first) and at Schwartz's the very next day.  I'm sorry to say I have to \"profane the sacred name\": Schwartz's sucks.  Lester's meat was moist, correctly and adequately spiced and smoke flavor was low, but it was there.  Schwartz's meat was of lower quality, inadequately spiced to the point of blandness, and even though I ordered a medium, was very fat.  I tasted no smoke flavor at all.  It was really second rate smoked meat.  Schwartz's sour pickle was very good though, I must say.  (I didn't have a pickle at Lester's.)  Lester's was not at all crowded and service was very good.  Schwartz's service was also very good, but it was crowded and as usual I had to share the table I was at.  I didn't mind sharing, because I like talking to people.  (But I talked to people in Lester's too, without being crowded.)  Schwartz's looks like it caters to tourists and ex-Montrealers and anyone that doesn't know better.  Schwartz's has history, but not quality.  I'll be visiting Montreal again in a month and I'll go to Lester's, but not Schwartz's."}
{"text":"This is an amazing deli restaurant wonderfully run by a great family.  The service here is great and they make an excellent smoked meat sandwich!"}
{"text":"We fell in love with this establishment immediately.  The decor was unpretentious, a real place that has managed to stay authentic over the decades.  Oh, and the food.  Absolutely delicious brisket sandwich.  I can't decide whether my wife's brisket was better than my corned beef, but suffice to say, we loved both."}
{"text":"I love Lesters smoke meat . I grew up with Lesters .  But please Stay away from the one at the airport . It was a disgusting mess of mustard with meat .  I've never seen anything like it in my life . I gave it back .  The merchant kept yelling at me that's how a smoke-meat is served. I paid 18$ for this special and left it at their counter.   Don't waste you money !!!"}
{"text":"get the pastrami or reuben! soooo good....I go every time I'm in MTL."}
{"text":"Best Smoked meat in town and I've tried all the spots. The smoked meat poutine is the best combo of perfectly done fries, fresh cheese curds, brown sauce and amazing smoked meat!  My favorite poutine hands down."}
{"text":"Sometimes there's no substitute for the real thing.   Lesters with its iconic bright yellow awning, has been a mainstay in the Outremont neighborhood for years now. My grandma lives just around the corner from this institution and though I often walked by during visits to Montreal, I never found the time to go in for a bite. Why?  Because my grandma and her clan are die-hard Schwartz's folks.   Yes, the sole incarnation of smoked meat they've come to know has been from the famous deli downtown. Even my mother, who finds little to embrace in Western cuisine, has a hankering for the restaurant's famed brisket every now and then.   Cut to a recent visit to Montreal with mum, when we were both hit with smoked meat cravings. My mother wanted Schwartz's of course but we were due back at Grandma's for lunch so we were playing hooky and couldn't ask the rest of the clan for directions. Furthermore, I was without my bearings (i.e. smart phone), so I proposed we hit up Lesters instead. \"Okay,\" she muttered begrudgingly.   There's sidewalk seating during the warm months so deli goers can enjoy the comings and goings of the neighborhood while they nosh. Very European. Inside, there's a different feel. Old-school diner. There's booths, rows of tables and a deli counter where the slicers stand hand-slicing the brisket. Tchotchkes from bygone decades in Quebec fill the walls.   We're seated quickly inside and place our order with our server, a curt but sassy type with a thick Quebecois accent. Two smoked meat sammies, an order of fries and a ginger ale in a frosty mug to share. Mum does not want to share a sandwich despite the obvious fact that we'll be eating more at Grandma's later.   Our meal arrives. The fries are not very crispy on the outside but feature very soft, fluffy and sweet innards. They are addictive but they lack crunch. I take a bite out of my sandwich and I already know what the verdict will be. But I wait for mum to deliver her pronouncement. She takes a bite, squirts a little more mustard onto her sandwich and begins pawing at the meat at bit with her fork. If there ever was a time to tell someone to stop playing with their food.....  But then the kvetching starts up. \"NO! Not the same\", she weighs in. Adding to that, \"Soft meat, no flavor. Other place better.\" And of course, \"How come other table get more pickles than us!\"  Okay.   This is her 'I told you so' moment in food form. It's true though. The meat, although velvety soft from the steaming, lacks the beautiful array of spices or much smoke. It may be hand sliced expertly into paper thin slices but it doesn't make up for the blandness or the slimy texture. A extra squirt or two of mustard fails to perk up the DOA meat. There's no oomph here, sad to say. The sandwich reminds me faintly of my experience at Ben's years ago, though even that version had more flavour. I suspect that they use industrial processed briskets which are jacked up with chemicals and preservatives. I don't have a problem with that so long as the flavour remains intact. The whole sandwich is rather underwhelming. We continue on with our fries, gobbling them up.   So this is not the best smoked meat that Montreal has to offer. It may alright fine for diner fare or what not but skip the brisket. Next time, no shortcuts!"}
{"text":"Local deli serving delicious smoked meat platters. I ordered the Smoked Meat Poutine and the husband ordered the Smoked Meat Special Sandwich. We also ordered a side of pickles and coleslaw. The Poutine was amazing and the hubby seemed to have enjoyed his sandwich. I can't speak for Schwartz's Deli but if you're not looking to wait in line for an hour and you want friendly service and delicious food then look no further!"}
{"text":"Very kid friendly and customer oriented. As soon as we walked in, the waitress helped us get seated with a 2 1/2 year old and brought him a puzzle to play with. She was very attentive to us, brought food quickly. The order was correct and the food was wonderful. My brother and I both had the smoked meat. He said he would eat here every day if he could. The fries tasted a bit sweeter than I am used to. They were also not over salted like many places and not crispy, but very good."}
{"text":"A nice place to eat at with your family. My parents love smoke meat and this is their favourite place."}
{"text":"Really really good smoked meat. I took my parents here to avoid lines at you-know-where, and were not disappointed. In fact this might be better smoked meat than any other place on the island. Why only 4 stars and not 5? Well, the service wasn't great. But the food was, which is what mostly matters! We had smoked meat sandwiches (medium lean, not too too fatty, just the way you want them), a smoked meat poutine, and sides of potato salad, pickles, and beers in their most awesome frozen mugs. My dad already wants another sandwich before they leave town.  (They also have an airport location, and I know he might get some more there!)"}
{"text":"It's OK if you enjoy a salty chemical taste in your mouth for the rest of the day, they don't smoke their meat in house like Schwartz's, Smoked Meat Pete or Delibees.  It's industrial mushy smoked meat, go to the places mentioned above."}
{"text":"Yo, the smoked meat, fries, and pickle is like, pretty damn good! Put some vinegar on those fries. Lovely area."}
{"text":"Had a smoked meat sandwich and smoked meat poutine. Very quick and friendly service. We got to sit outside and got our food in under 10 minutes. One of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"As an ex-Montrealers visiting relatives, I had a hankering for smoked meat. \"Real\" Montreal smoked meat. My kids have never had it (try finding it in Seattle. Hrmph!), and I debated going to Schwartz's or here to Lester's. I didn't particularly want to deal with the long line of tourists at Schwartz's or with the issue of parking on the Main, so we decided to come here instead. My relatives prefer Lester's, anyhow, and come here regularly (but its been about 5 or 6 years since I've been here).  It was as good as ever.  Cute seating area outside, but our larger party chose to sit inside, surrounded by all the Montreal memorabilia of yore. It's a real Jewish deli feel inside and I imagine it hasn't changed much, if at all. In the past 50 years.   The food was capital-A amazing. We all had the iconic smoked meat sandwiches. They're exactly as I remember them from my youth. My 80 year old dad said the same thing. The sandwiches were piled high with soft, moist, perfectly seasoned meat (we all chose medium fa), with rye bread and mustard. The French fries were capital-D delicious, which we doused in vinegar. My kids were in heaven. The pickles were a bit too sour for me, but everyone else loved them. Everything was devoured quickly.  The service was great and attentive, and the owner chatted with us.   Asa bonus, it was nice to stroll Bernard, with all its shops and bistros."}
{"text":"I was hoping for more. It wasn't bad by any stretch... Just not what I was hoping for. Probably won't bother going back with so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Smoked meat and brisket sandwiches we ordered melted in our mouth. This place is fantastic"}
{"text":"We are from California and came with a large group of high schoolers. Lester and the rest of the staff made us feel at home and went out of their way to cater to us. food and atmosphere was outstanding and would love to come back next time we catch a change to visit montreal."}
{"text":"What a fun experience! Walking into Lester's felt like coming home after a long trip. The staff was so friendly, joking with my friend and me throughout our meal. While the restaurant was certainly filled to the brim, the wait staff at Lester's handled the crowd nicely.  I'm not a huge meat-eater, so instead of ordering a smoked meat sandwich, I opted for the smoked meat poutine. What a treat! It was my first, and only, time eating poutine. I must say- the idea of french fries drenched in gravy and cheese curds did not sound enticing, but I would happily order the dish again. The smoked meat added a hearty flavor, and was the perfect addition to the poutine. My friend and I split the order as a midday snack. We both left satisfied. I highly recommend Lester's Deli."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood deli restaurant.  Great and cheap breakfast.  Excellent smoked meat sandwich that I always recommend ahead of Schwartz's on The Main.  It's on Bernard surrounded by neighbourhood cafes, restaurants and shops in Outremont.  I love this little deli-diner.  If you like deli, you'll like this place.  It's authentic...and not such a tourist trap like Schwartz's.  Cherry coke....and some hard-to-find guilty pleasures like Big Turk bars and Pep chocolate bars.  WARNING.  DO NOT GO HERE IF CHOLESTEROL IS A CONCERN.  IT'CALLED LESTERS...BUT I CALL IT choLESTERS..with a smile."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I wasn't crazy about their \"smoked meat\" that they're known for, I give them 5 stars anyway. Note: I did end up liking their smoked meat in an omelette that my husband ordered twice and loved. We ate there 3 times during our recent 8 day visit to Montreal. It was worth every Uber dollar it took to get there from \"Old Town\".  I ordered the salad with chopped liver. I've had chopped liver all my life in a long list of NY, LA, Miami and SF Jewish delis. Lester's was my all time favorite and my husband's as well. Interestingly they make it with beef liver. The salad it comes on is a straight forward basic lettuce and tomato and maybe cucumber salad. I was shocked that I liked the dressing as I usually don't like salad dressing with red vinegar (the norm in the U.S.). Turns out they use white vinegar which I like. I also LOVE their French fries.   They have Dr. Brown's black cherry soda, a real plus in the Jewish deli hall of fame.  I especially like the vibe there. It is family owned. Sybil, the daughter of the Lester (the guy who founded it) owns it now, and her nieces work there. Her daughter's first attempt at making chopped liver was really great. We were honored to have had some! Sybil is welcoming and wonderful ~~~ and the family vibe is great.  And besides all that goodness, I found out Leonard Cohen used to be a regular."}
{"text":"We rolled right up at lunch and they accommodated a table of 7!!!  We live in a place where people win awards for BBQ but this smoked meat was my favorite ever. The service was fast and they were so kind to our little guy, which we didn't find was super common in Montreal. I would eat here weekly and get the smoked sandwich special or the smoked meat poutine. Woah."}
{"text":"Great find for a cheap, quick but authentic deli lunch. I had smoked turkey and Poutine. Yum!!"}
{"text":"My first Montreal smoked meat sandwich experience was at Schwartz's and honestly, I don't think anything will and could ever top that. I woke up hungover and craving smoked meat this morning and live in Mile End (on Avenue du Parc) so didn't feel like trekking over to Schwartz's. After doing some quick searching, I read about Lester's. You can't really compare the two in my opinion. The ambience and even the main sandwich itself are both so different from each other at either location. What I can say is that the man who served me (I was the only customer there at 8:30 in the morning; I assume he was the owner but forgot to ask, was too focused on getting my food!) was extremely friendly and willing to cater to my every need. I liked the sandwich and personally the bread here was softer and warmer than at Schwartz's if I MUST make any comparison at all. The man was so nice that I decided to give them more of my business and ordered some meat to go--extra fatty--which tastes amazing heated up at home! He gave me very specific instructions to BATHE the meat in hot water, NOT boil it! I will be back. Can't be eating smoked meat every day but I will definitely swing by again the next time I need a fix."}
{"text":"This is one of THE BEST local diners I've ever visited! It's a family-owned place with a legacy in Montreal -- and that's clear from the moment you step in. Artifacts and fun, kitschy things all over the walls. Kind, friendly, patient servers & an owner that will have you laughing the whole time! Now..... the smoked meat.... was AMAZING! There are no words! This is a MUST for anyone visiting Montreal... or living there... or nearby... or hours away... just GO! It's THAT good!!!"}
{"text":"En vacances à Montréal quelques jour, je veux ma smoked meat ! Mon amie m'emène donc ici car il faut dire c'est juste à côté de chez elle. La carte propose pas mal de spécialités à base de smoked meat mais pas que... Je choisis la poutine. Un plat bien servi et copieux arrive. La poutine est vraiment bonne et la smoked meat par dessus apporte vraiment un plus à ce plat typique québécois. Le seul petit bémol pour la belge que je suis est la cuisson des frites. Pour le reste, c'est top ! C'est sûr que lorsque je reviendrai à Montréal je passerai ici pour une petite poutine."}
{"text":"The roast beef/brisket poutine is the best poutine and best smoked meat in Montreal!  Love this place. AND you don't have to stand in line for a half hour!  The owner is really friendly too; he gave my 4 year old a toy each time we came."}
{"text":"Whoa I haven't reviewed Lester's? What have I been doing with my life! If you're in the Outremont area why don't you tuck into big back booths or plunk yourself on the chairs on the wide sidewalk. The service here I like honestly, though I can see from the reviews it's not for everyone, this is a place with history and humour and straight talk. And nice smoked meat sandwiches and burgers and delicious delicious perfect fries. You can also get amazing pickles and cheesecake, and the counter has vacuum sealed packs of house deli meat to take home."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place. The food is amazing, hands down the best stuffed chicken in the city. Great friendly service, reasonable pricing and a fantastic location on Bernard."}
{"text":"This is a cozy local deli, but their products are distributed widely.   Went with friends as part of a smoked-meat-restaurant comparison expedition.  The consensus was the meat was good, but I personally tried the veggie burger.  Not what you would expect have at a meat place,  or even a standard deli. Well, it was amazingly good.  Like many veggie burgers the precise ingredients were hard to identify,  but it had fried onions,  great spices and a fanatic taste and freshness.  The service was also superb and the ambiance excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best. Really juicy meat, fresh bread and delicious pickles. Plus, no lineup - off the beaten path of tourists. Eat with the locals who have been going there for decades (why would they change?). I always bring visitors to Lester's for smoked meat, and I usually end up shipping them meat later on (yes you can do this!)."}
{"text":"Decent food, owner charismatic but clearly only talks to you for positive reviews. Waitress was absolutely clueless, didn't remember anything, messed up several of our orders and was rude when we asked her questions. Prices are just ok, they are always trying to upsell you though. The owner asked me to write this review, next time pick your audience better buddy."}
{"text":"Way too over priced for mediocre food. I paid $35 for a smoke meat sandwich (old fashioned) a pickle soft drink and poutine. This should be a trio for $18 MaX and instead they charged me individually for everything. The poutine was reheated fries and came in a small styrofoam container (Stingy)  All the food was mediocre and not worth the premium tourist prices they charge on top of the fact they will try and take you through the ringer and charge you all individual instead of charging the trio. One thing that becomes very apparent from my experience is that they must be struggling to make money by these practices $$"}
{"text":"Great smoked meats and sandwiches. The team that works and owns this place is incredible and so welcoming. Gave us great ideas for local places to visit. I would recommend sticking with the foods that they're known for rather than going beyond the meats. So glad we came here!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here 3 or 4 times.  Service is always friendly, smoke meat and everything else is top quality.  Lester's deliver fresh, & fast with next day across the country service.  As an ex-Montrealer, being able to add Mae West, Joe Louis & Gazette are very nice touches.  I love that you can mail order the full meal here...smoke meat, rye bread, pickles, cole slaw, desert, newspapers, highly recommended to ex-Montrealers anywhere.  I'm a big fan of this place and have been for years!"}
{"text":"Thank you guys!!!! We were recommended this place by our bike tour guide Darren. We wanted a local and well known place to try smoked meat! oMG!!! This was great. Our first time in Montreal from NYC and I must say thank you Lester's for making it memorable. We had to go take our food to go but while we waited we had 2 ice cold beers and it was the icing on the cake. Thank you for this great meal!"}
{"text":"Chose this place instead of Schwartz since I don't like crowds and wanted something comparable while staying Outremont.  The smoked meat is what I was seeking out while in Montreal. It was the perfect sandwich and something I could not get in LA. Moist, warm, tender and delectable.  A nice alternative to touristy Schwartz with a mom and pop shop feel. A local recommended it to me. I was the only one there in the restaurant and loved every moment just me, my sandwich, and my black cherry soda."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little deli which serves fantastic smoked meat sandwiches!! I enjoyed the old school interiors of the place and had a fun time looking over the extensive collection of novelty tin boxes they have. The old school theme is carried rt till the end when the bill arrives - an actual handwritten receipt!  We ordered the smoked meat sandwich with beer. The sandwich is really almost 3 inches of meat bookended by bread slices. The bread is nothing special, but the meat is delicious. They had a special on beer, sort of happy hours so that was a bonus.   Overall, worth the trek to an area out of the tourist zone. Walk around the neighborhood too if you get the chance. Peaceful and pretty."}
{"text":"Lâchons le morceau tout de suite : je préfère Lester à Schwartz. Et de beaucoup. Voilà, c'est dit. Pourquoi me demanderez-vous ? Les raisons sont nombreuses.   À l'opposé de son célèbre concurrent du boulevard St-Laurent, Lester a su rester familiale sans devenir une trappe à touriste. Le service est rapide et amicale. La propreté du resto est franchement meilleure. Ici, le client n'est pas entassé comme des sardines. Pas de maudite file d'attente à la porte avec ses sempiternels touristes. Les serveurs sont souriants, polis, courtois. Ajoutons que le quartier dans lequel ce resto est situé est absolument charmant. Avant, ou après votre repas, je vous recommande une promenade sur la rue Bernard qui regorge de commerces intéressants. Un must par une belle journée d'été. De plus, le resto possède une belle petite terrasse l'été.  Pour la viande (car c'est le plus important non?) je dirais que la qualité et le gout est très comparable à celle de Schwartz. Les frites sont meilleures. Je recommande de choisir le Lester spécial incluant un sandwich SM, une frite, un cornichon et une boisson gazeuse.  Si vous êtes un touriste qui visite notre belle métropole montréalaise, pensez-y avant de vous précipiter chez Schwartz et de faire la file pendant une heure. Votre guide Lonely Planet ne dit pas tout à propos du Smoke Meat. En cas de doute, demandez aux montréalais. Ils seront vous guider vers une alternative intéressante. Moi, je vous conseille de venir ici, chez Lester."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The traditional smoked meat is so flavorful and juicy, I dare say it's tastier than Schwartz. The downside is, the service is just as bad as the food is good. At least 3 people of the staff were really unpleasent. Without even asking, you receive your bill while you're still eating. The restaurant was not crowded, and both times I went we received the bill without asking for it or being offered something else. I find that really unkind. That's why I never got to try any of the desserts :p"}
{"text":"I went there earlier this year for Valentines. Ended up becoming up another big fan. I had Smoked Meat with the poutine and also tried a bagel with smoked salmon. Everything was done superbly and the service was terrific. This really is a nice joint to try for locals or tourists for a nice brunch out. Good for family too.   PS. Great option to try if you're bored with always the usual place Schwartz ;)"}
{"text":"Before I start let me say I am a Montreal Jewish Deli aficionado, having eaten at every single one in the city. And out of the \"big three\", Schwartz's, The Main and Lesters; Lesters comes in third place out of maybe 10 deli's I consider good (with Chennoys in the West Island being the WORST).  That is not to say it is bad, the meat is quite good.  Service is all right too, the counter girl is charming, friendly and made amusing jokes. that made my day.  UPDATE 2016: I came back and was content with my meal the 4th time around. And, the Charming counter girl filled up my water bottle \"on the house\" on a 90 degree summer day. It was very nice of her!  Lester's is aight."}
{"text":"Super Deluxe and a mug of Racinette with an order of Poutine with smoked meat on the side -- Délicieux!  Excellent noms and bevvies, great eclectic ambiance, very friendly and accommodating service, at a reasonable price worth every bite."}
{"text":"Pricey for smoke meat place at 20$ for sandwich coke fries and pickle...  Smoked meat has no taste . Go to Schwartz wait in line u will love your smoked meat much more there..."}
{"text":"The smoked meat poutine was amazing and the smoked meat sandwich was good as well. We tried Lester's after going to Schwartz earlier in the week and preferred the dining experience here much better. Great service and no wait!"}
{"text":"Nothing special , we did not like it at all, we ordered club sandwich it came cold , about smoked meat ? We knew the smoked meat can't be as good as Schwartz but we did not know it was disgusting it has no spices  it was like a boiled meat no taste and it was like rubber, rye bread has no taste , hot dog was  good ( after all it's just a hot dog ) potato salad was disgusting no taste, waitresses ? Omg they are nervous they don't smile they are not polite at all . Its a kind of place i would not go back unless everywhere is closed and i am starving then I would just get a hot dog and leave."}
{"text":"As they say, \"do as the Romans do\", well you want to eat good smoke meat, \"do as the Jewish do\". Located in Montreal's Jewish neighbourhood, Lester's is Montreal's finest when it comes to smoke meat."}
{"text":"A few locals recommended that we try Lester's over Schwartz, which is somehow always packed. While a bit out of the way, Lester's is well worth the trip. It feels like a true neighborhood deli, with little to no tourists and an unpretentious atmosphere.   We had the reuben, which was moist and extremely tender. Definitely add some their signature mustard. I wouldn't put the sandwich it in the same category as its counterpart at Katz Deli in NYC, but it's close! They have a bunch of craft sodas as well, the black cherry was our favorite."}
{"text":"I'm a Schwartz guy. Even when I was working as a professor in Chicago, I would pay homage to the place via a picture of three Schwartz sandwiches (instead of a picture of myself) on my professor homepage. I still love Schwartz.  However, Lester's is fabulous as well. In fact, I may start going there more often for three reasons: (1) the quality is comparable - though I marginally prefer Schwartz, (2) they offer a larger menu of options - which is irrelevant to my tummy but relevant to those of my less rational friends, and (3) the place is more quiet - it truly has felt like a neighborhood haunt when I've gone.  To sum up, if I have smoke meat crazed friends in town and I want to maximally impress them, I'll go to Schwartz. Off peak hours and alone? Dido. Any other scenario? I may very well go w/ Lester's!"}
