{"text":"Went to Doppio Zero for a family event. Restaurant is cozy. Waitstaff is very cordial and attentive- our waiter was Silvio. The pizza is delicious- the sauce is exquisite. Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Been a few times and it's always been fine, if not great. But had an awful customer service experience tonight. Seems like one of the wait staff (one of the owners? Not sure..) has determined that it's a privilege to be in their restaurant. A simple question about when we might expect our meal - it had been 40 mins, at least 3 tables that arrived after us were already happily eating, and he had walked past us several times with no acknowledgement - turned into an ordeal where we felt punished for the rest of the night. Too many other good local choices with great service to ever come back.  Sorry guys - a simple \"we're sorry - there was a problem in the kitchen\" would have fixed it all."}
{"text":"excellent since new owners took over....everything is cooked fresh...the gluten free pizza crust in unreal...you really can't tell it's gluten free...great atmosphere and excellent service !"}
{"text":"We visited with friends and were quite happy. The grilled whole fish special (Mediterranean sea bass) was delicious. The Caesar salad wasnt over dressed, which was refreshing! The food for all of us was cooked the way it was asked. The chili pepper in oil was the spiciest I've found in any restaurant, very impressive. I find that the prices are a bit on the high end for what this establishment warrants which is why I didn't give it a 5. But, I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"I went there with a group of friends around noon time and there was only one waiter. The foods were okay and quiet pricey."}
{"text":"We've recently moved into the neighbourhood, and have been to Doppio Zero a number of times. We love the warm inviting atmosphere, gracious service and great italian food. The risottos I've tried have all been perfect; my favourite being the Asparagus,Pea with a hint of Gorgonzola cheese. The whole fish is a good choice and the homemade pastas never disappoint. We've dined around downtown Toronto during our first year in the city. We've found restaurants with good food, and service. Doppio Zero was the first that we've returned to multiple times, and will keep coming back to."}
{"text":"Our first four visits were very good, 4 stars for sure, especially service.  My last visit, food was 3 stars, service was zero.  Totally unattentive waiter, brought wrong meals to my sons, long after I had finished my meal.  No compensation from manager/owner or apology.  Not on my radar any more!!  Only second time in my life that I left a zero tip, which was exactly what was deserved!!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time under the new ownership. They were fantastic. Food was great and service superb, did not rush us out of the restaurant.. Loved the pasta and steak.Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, love their pasta and fried calamari,don't like their pizza. The restaurant it's clean and really nice inside."}
{"text":"Order through Foodora & feel very ripped off - $65 for a house salad, eggplant Parmesan & a bolognese dish. Over priced skimpy  portions, hot dishes arrived cold & and pretty bland. Will never order from Doppio Zero again!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are good, but I was disappointed with the Veal chop. I asked to get it medium-rare but got it well done, it was very chewy and the seasoning was very uneven. Some spots of the veal was very salty and some not salty enough. The desserts were very good though. The creme brulee had a very good flavour though the custard was scrambled a little bit in the creme brulee. It only really affected the texture slightly and if you weren't an expert on creme brulee you would not have noticed it. The tiramisu was also very good. I will probably not return because the dessert were the only good part of the meal"}
{"text":"Presentation over taste. overpriced for low quality food. Seems very crowded with just a few people inside."}
{"text":"Ordered from here on Uber Eats after checking a few other menus for pizza and liking a few from here. I was much better off throwing some frozen pizza into the toaster oven. Dr Oetker is more consistent and tasty with more toppings. I used to think it's hard to screw up pizza but Doppio batted 0 for 3.  Funghi: Described as tomato sauce, mozzarella, an assortment of mushrooms with chilies and garlic oil.  Assortment equates to ONE type of mushrooms, just 2 white mushrooms sliced into the pizza.   Rucolina: Described on menu as tomato sauce, Niagara prosciutto and arugula salad. The arugula was grossly wilted from age and not heat. Some pieces were yellow. Not sure why the menu said arugula salad instead of just arugula because there was nothing else on the pizza asides from the described items.   Picante: Described as tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy sopressatta, roasted red peppers, black olives and hot peppers. There were roasted yellow peppers instead of red which was an acceptable replacement (I wouldn't have minded being given a replacement for the nasty arugula either), but it was all on one side of the pizza. There was barely any cheese. The olives were crazy salty and I didn't see nor taste any hot peppers.  I will never be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"A new neighborhood restaurant - yeah!! My wife and I and 2 couples showed up on their 5th day after opening. One would expect they had lots of bugs to work out, poor service, iffy food. However....we were blown away, pleasantly surprised, and looking forward to our next time back. The appetizers of raw oysters (malapeque, raspberry and P.E.I.) were great. At $3.70 a piece not the cheapest, but buy 10 and get 2 free made it worth it, plus they were sweet, briney and fresh. I had the mushroom ravioli, which was one of the best I've ever enjoyed. My friend had the white veal chop bone in, perfectly cooked and season. The pizza I shared with my wife was delicious - thin crust, amazing sauce and runny buffalo mozerella; as good as we've had at Michaels in Napoli. The wine was exceptionally priced. Doppio Zero will give 7 Numbers and Ferraro a run for their money, but hey, competition will only make them all better, not to mention The Green Eggplant, Abott Pub and Ha Long Bay Bistro. For dessert we all headed next door to Hotel Gelato, not that Doppio Zero's molten lava choclate cake didn't look amazing, but we had a hankering for gelato. The Heddington Ave corridor has become a slice of gastronomic heaven!"}
{"text":"Have to say I made that mistake of reading everyone's reviews before going in...blah blah blah whiners, this place is great.  The pizza is awesome - might not have some fancy three letter designations, but tastes way better than those anyway!  On our table we had about 6 different mains and 4 apps and they were all extremely tasty and nicely presented.  The atmosphere is nice, but it's the character that makes it here, Eglinton? At times I thought it was St. Clair, with the characters coming in and out for a take-out or a beer or simply to say hello to a compadre.    To the costs - funny but when you have a great night no one seems to care, but overall it's not nearly as bad as others might have said, if it's high it is likely from the quality of the ingredients, from the pasta to the pizza and a few stops in their for a little veal and a little grilled calamari, the freshness was incredible.  Loved the place, the people, the wine and especially the food!  (Try the Margherita pizza as an appetite, bet you can have just one!)"}
{"text":"Doppio Zero has delicious food, attentive staff and a location right in our neighbourhood. The polenta in a mushroom cream sauce I ate was mouth-watering and the chocolate martiinis were done well. My fiancee enjoyed the seafood pasta which she said was delicious, and our friends devoured their steaks and drinks. Oysters afterward were fresh. $130 for four entrees, drinks and oysters. I would recommend the Italian beer! Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"From Calabria with Love. A story about a father and son, and their passion for southern Italian cuisine. From the Domenico family who brought you the celebrated Montreal restaurant, Lucca, in partnership with Francesco Cardinale, comes Doppio Zero (Double 00 - license for the most highly refined Italian flour). Open since December, with Sinatra on the soundtrack, in a neighborhood near you.  Armeni Domenico says, \"I'd rather get used to this new environment now, so that when we get busier, I'll be more than ready.\" Natale Domenico says, \"We try to get our ingredients, across the board, from Calabria.\" 3 Entering the modern dining room, a long bar seats local residents enjoying thin crunchy pizzas from the embers of the wood-burning oven. Large cans of San Marzano tomatoes line the wall. Wooden communal tables and candle-lit tables for two add a warm rustic ambience.  A Sicilian Caesar cocktail plush with olives is finished with Italian sausage and parmesan on the rim. Crackling pizza with tomato, fresh mozzarella, a medley of 1 mushrooms, chilies and garlic oil envelope us with savoury Neopolitan aromatics. The dough has rested and fermented for thirty-six hours to its optimum sweetness.  Char-grilled octopus splashed with lemon vinaigrette is the essence of the Mediterranean. Succulent lamb chops are tended with virtuosity, and crown delicately seasoned saut√©ed Swiss chard, and warm potatoes, simmered in garlic, are mashed with fresh basil and cream. We could eat them right out of the pot. There is more. We're introduced to egg fettuccini with meaty swordfish, colourized with cherry tomatoes and capers, and uniquely scented with 4 saffron for a perfectly balanced array of flavours. All the pastas and pizzas are available as gluten-free or whole-wheat.  The Domenicos know what Italian food is all about, and have filled a niche along Eglinton West, an area in need of a good neighbourhood restaurant. Doppio Zero is a restaurant with a pedigree that serves the classics dishes with a creative twist. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I went here for my brother's birthday.  This place is shit.  Everyone at our table was dissatisfied with our meal.  I waited over an hour to eat cheap pasta that was worse than the cheapest pasta you get at the grocery store, and the sauce tasted like it came in a can - which it probably did.  The price was ridiculously expensive. Portions were small.  I don't know why this place was so busy.  It was full of people who had a lot of money, only ate at \"trendy\" places, but wouldn't know a good meal, if it hit them in the face.  Even looking at the pictures below, it looks crappy.  Fancy garbage.   Go to East Side Marios - It's way better!"}
{"text":"A pleasant, homey resto at not-homey prices. The food was okay, and while I want to round up for the sweet service, I think the current 3.5 star Yelp average is accurate.  The gourmet price point for mains is far too steep for what you get at this neighbourhood joint. One of the specials was a vegetarian risotto, which *sounded* fantastic and which I totally would have gone for if it wasn't a ludicrous $29. For that much, we decided we'd be better off getting fish - sadly I wasn't super into our sea bass ($32) or the polenta it came with, both of which needed some flavour.  Tuna carpaccio appetizer (also a special) was DELICIOUS! Good thing we ordered two. They came as generous rounds atop avocado, which one of my dining partners* said was different from the last time she had it, so I don't know if it changes.  *She's been here 3 times and gotten the shrimp spaghettini ($24) every time, so maybe that's a safe bet.  Pizza (I had the Fiorentina, $15) is supposed to be a selling point, but lackluster compared to other offerings around town, especially the VPN variety. As you may have discerned from my other reviews, pizza is not only my favourite food but my favourite element of human existence in general, and I would still probably opt out of ordering it here next time. Note: I would peg their chili oil at suicidal-level heat so use it accordingly.  Again, service was great - they're excellent with accommodating dietary restrictions and they kept the bread coming. Our waiter treated us to some chamomile grappa at the end of our meal which was a lovely touch."}
{"text":"Sat with some Co-workers for lunch. Got a pizza and it had nice taste. Oily. Complimentary bread was nice. Small menu but I'm surr has lots to offer"}
{"text":"I've dined here numerous times (since I live a 2-minute walk away) and consistently enjoy it.  I usually order the whole grilled spigola and hubby usually gets the zuppa di pesce (mixed seafood in a delicious broth)...both excellent choices. The calamari and pizzas are also great.  The decor is sophisticated yet cozy....a perfect ambiance for an Italian bistro.  Even on a block with two other great Italian options (Seven Numbers & Ferraro), Doppio Zero is a welcome addition."}
{"text":"Great food. Abusive owner who preys on employees. Won't go back & encourage you not to as well. Eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"A family oriented restaurant with a great friendly customer service... Picante is my favourite pizza... Do not forget to ask for their homemade chilli sauce... Hey, watch out, thatZ hot...."}
{"text":"The food is gross.  I wouldn't even call it Italian food.  It's pasta and stuff.  Not Italian food.    I had the shrimp spaghetti and I barely touched it simply because it was so unpalatable.  It's worse than the Italian food you get at big family restaurants like Jack Astor's and Pickle Barrel.  It's really bad.  Even the bread they give you is white bread out of a bag.  Just don't go here.  Go to McDonalds across the street if you have to."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new local Italian establishment with some out of town friends. Loved the ambiance, liked the food. The funghi/mushroom pizza was adequate. A little on the small side, tasty thin crust but too few mushrooms.  The halibut was tasty with capers and olives. Nice selection of accompanying vegetables and potatoes. The pasta with chicken was a good choice for my husband.  Dessert was a BIG disappointment. We initially ordered molten lava chocolate cake. When it arrived it was neither molten nor lava but it was so small we could barely see it. How they came up with an $8.00 price tag was ridiculous. This minuscule dessert was way too over-baked and not terribly tasty. The waitress offered us a second dessert on the house to make up for the lava cake. Who could refuse? We then gave the Tiramisu a try. Although better than the lava cake, the Tiramisu was also much too small to warrant an $8.00 price tag.  All in all, Doppio  Zero was a pleasant experience. Hopefully, by the time we return, they will have realized that continuing to charge $8.00 for a dessert will require an increase in the size of the dessert to justify it's price."}
