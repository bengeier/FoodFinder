{"text":"Hubby and I decided to give this place a try because we'd just moved the to the neighbourhood. I ordered Chicken kabob and he tried the Ghormed Sabzi. the chicken simply melted in my mouth like it was ice cream! So right away I knew there was something wrong with that picture. I couldn't take more than a few bites. Hubby, on the other hand, got the worst stomach pain that he says he's ever experienced in his entire adult life. The taste and texture of the meat was not familiar to either one of us (maybe a bit suspect!). Will never ever return and definitely cannot recommend the food. The staff, however, were very polite and did their best to take care of the customers. Alas...at the end of the day, you go to a restaurant to eat good (or somewhat good) food first, customer service becomes irrelevant when you get sick!"}
{"text":"They have been there for almost 20 years(which means they are doing something right to stay in business longer than your typical restaurant which closes in less than 3 years). Not your average 5 star restaurant. mostly cab drivers and blue collar workers go there. Food is great and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Kind and courteous service. Really amazing quality food. I was turned on to fantastic Persian cuisine by my students, I never would have known. Try their Cello Kebab (beef skewer) dinner with rice, really nice job guys!"}
{"text":"A small unpretentious Persian place on a quiet corner of Danforth east of Pharmacy. I loved the lamb shank stew served with fragrant basmati rice and salad of fresh eye-watering onions and radish. They have an assortment of kebabs and other Persian dishes. The lamb i ordered was slow cooked to perfection and was falling off the bones. Tasty meal without breaking your bank. Do not miss this one. A Persian gem of a restaurant indeed !"}
{"text":"Having read the good reviews about Sedaghat on Yelp, I have been meaning to go for some time, and finally made it there this past week. It was about 8pm and the entire neighbourhood was very quiet. The inside lighting was dimmed, there was only 1 other person there eating, but a few others came for take-out. The restaurant is very spacious and very clean, with only about a dozen tables throughout. It seemed to be a one-man operation that evening, the same man that took my order then went behind the counter to prepare it, which took less than 10min. He was polite but not very talkative.  The menu offers an assortment of different meat kabobs; I chose the Sultani Kabob, which is one skewer each of veal and ground beef with basmati rice and pita bread. The veal was good but could have been a bit more tender, and the ground beef was tender and very tasty. The basmati rice was actually the best part of the meal; I was glad to have some left over which I added to my lunch the next day. A good sized portion, and overall a very good meal; only $17 with a drink, and there are plates available for under $10. I would certainly recommend a visit if you're in the area (which is a little out of the way, beyond the busy part of Danforth)."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, prices are reasonable, and the owner & staff are awesome! Definitely a charm amongst the dreary Danforth East scene. The chicken kabob with rice is my go-to meal here!"}
{"text":"Nothing new to add to the previous reviews really.  Two of us both had the chicken kebab, with the lentil soup.  Everything was delicious!  Chicken was very tender and tasty.  Not a ton of things on the menu, but the meal was quite satisfying, and price worthy.  And yes, the staff were very nice."}
