{"text":"Wanted to get something healthy for lunch and decided on this place. Lots of cool options that you can add to a salad or build your own. The salad was made quickly and I thought it tasted pretty good however the price is a little steep. But if your looking for something quick and healthy try it out !"}
{"text":"Great salads and so happy they are available on Uber eats. Always get my food quickly. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Great salad overall. To be completely honest, I have never been a fan of salads. I always found them to be too expensive for what they provide. This time, I am giving salad a chance. Today, I tasted salad from this restaurant called \"Vinaigrette\". I got it for delivery. Delivery time was reasonable.  As for the salad, as it is the first salad I've tasted, my expectations were fairly low. Needless to say, i was satisfied. I had the \"Protein\" salad with contained chicken with honey dijon dressing. The portion was generous and I was full after the meal. The blend of flavor was also surprisingly good.   Will definitely give this salad place a visit in restaurant!"}
