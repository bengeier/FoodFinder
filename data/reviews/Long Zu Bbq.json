{"text":"Terrific! Pure China North-east style restaurant. Good service & nice people. 
We ordered 6 hot dishes w bbq items, they are all delicious. Recommended for those who are found of Chinese northern cuisine."}
{"text":"Location/Service:
Right in the heart of Chinatown Mississauga, plenty of parking available.  The restaurant has a small entrance, but relatively big inside.

Service was good - staff spoke mostly in Mandarin.  The menu was easy to understand as you check off what you want to eat and the quantity.


Food:
My experience was for a party of 8 people. We ordered a various of things - and this place is really known for their northern spice marinated skewers.  Definitely worth to try are the lamb skewers or vegetables.  They're all have that similar type of spice/marinate into it.  Interestingly it's not overly spiciness that it burns you, it's a good kick of spice feeling to it.  Also worthy to try would be their appetizer cold tofu, noodles, eggplant and fried rice.


If you're into spicy food or northern Chinese style, this is a good place to try.  Pricing wise is also good for the buck!"}
{"text":"Great authentic North Eastern Chinese food!  Awesome flavours!  Be sure to try the stir fry eggplant  dish!  Will come again and again"}
{"text":"Food is alright. But really bad service. We didn't even get a menu when we sat down and the waitress won't even look you in the eye and can't hear what she is talking about at all."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The restaurant is located inside of the old Chinatown in Mississauga. The environment is fairly neat and clean. 

They primarily offer western Chinese style barbecue cuisine. The seasonings for the lamb and animal organs are flavorful and I will say one of the best in Mississauga. However, the taste for the starters are not consistent. We had a dish of tried bean curd with celery for a few times. The taste were never the same. It was either too plain or too salty for the 2nd and 3rd time. If the cook can make sure that the taste is more closer for every visit, I will definitely recommend everyone to out this place more often. 

Another issue for this restaurant is the amount of waitresses. I think they are always short on staff. The owner is always busy at making the skewers, so left the only waitress to run back and forth to serve multiple tables a time. It is caused longer time to serve each table. Hopefully, they will be able to add another staff member to share the workload. 

If this place is too far from your home, customers can order their food through a few delivery services in town. I found it is quite convenient for people under the time constraint."}
{"text":"Decor looks modern.  There was a big lcd screen in the middle of the restaurant playing a chinese drama movie with audio.  Restaurant was 20% full and staff was attentive and food started coming out 15 mins after ordering.  First dish that came out was the yangchow fried rice $9.99.  First time seeing spam being used in fried rice.  Portion size was small and greasier  than I would like but the flavours were good.  

Next came the lamb $5.99 and beef $5.99 skewers.  Lamb was tender and didn't have a strong gamy taste which I liked and the beef was a bit chewy and flavor of the meat was overpowered by the seasonings.  Price was good considering it was about $1.50 a skewer and amount of meat was good on each skewer.  

Next came the 15 dumplings (egg, chives, noodle, shrimp) $7.99.  Each dumpling had one small shrimp in there and fell apart after one bite.  I would avoid getting this dumpling as it tasted mostly like chives.

Last dish was the house special hot pot $14.99.  It was more like a stew with green beans, egg plant, pork, noodles and corn.  Came in a pan with a mini stove underneath it.  I wouldn't recommend because it seems like something that can easily be made at home and flavours wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"We had to wait long before seated because no one was paying attention to us. There were many empty spots though. 

Food was ok to eat.
Lamb and beef bbq were tender but it wasn't the best taste I had. But still ok to eat. 

Bbq chives were good. The amount we got for 1 portion was good too.

The shrimp dumplings with chives inside were very disappointing. Only a small shrimp was inside it. Didn't have much taste either. Loaded with chives inside.

Grill corn was good.
 
The fried chicken wings were good. Had a good crisp to it. 

They don't have liquid hot sauce. They will provide you with a powder chilli if you ask for hot sauce. Looks similar to what they put on the chicken wings. 

You take your own drink in the refrigerator. Even if you write it on the paper they won't bring it to you. We didn't know until we saw someone else taking their drinks from the refrigerator themselves"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for some late night BBQ.  They offer a variety of BBQ skewers but we pretty much come here only for the lamb skewers. The lamb skewers here are on point but everything else is meh. Tried their lobster ball the texture is weird. It's really soft and not bouncy. When you bite into it, it's bleh which i didn't like. I've also tried their squid. The flavour wasn't that good either. It tasted a little sour. 

We've also tried their chili beef. It was okay. I liked the flavour of it. It went well with rice. But the beef was really chewy. It would've been better if it was pork. 

As for drinks. They have a self serve type of system. You pretty much just go to the fridge and choose your own drinks. 

Overall, good place for lamb skewers."}
{"text":"spicy chinese food. 
cash or debit only.
have draft beer.. option as well. 
if u like cumin and Chinese spicy BBQ,  you should try out"}
{"text":"Lamb skewers are one of the best ones I've eaten in the GTA area. We ordered the North Eastern stew at first but we were disappointed by what was considered their special. It looked unappetizing, flavour was flat, and there wasn't much pork ribs inside the stew. We were still hungry after the stew since we gave up on eating it halfway. Ended up ordering a chilli chicken. Surprisingly, it was much better than the stew as it had just the right flavour and texture.

Service was disappointing. We sat near the front and the waitress ended up taking our orders by yelling across the other side of the restaurant.

I'm not too sure if I would come back. Maybe for a BBQ skewer craving but that would be it."}
{"text":"Came here for for skewers. This place offers a variety of different skewers and they also have hotpot and etc. 

I've tired their lamb skewers and lamb ribs. The lamb skewers were good they were fresh and flavorful. The lamb rib wasn't as good. It had a really strong lamb taste to it and was really fat and oily. It has not much taste. 

Service was pretty bad. Very inattentive. It's more like a self serve place as all the drinks are self served from the fridge. The only time the waiter provided service was when we ordered and when they brought the food. 

Overall, okay place for skewers."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! 
Didn't know there was a BBQ skewer restaurant place in Mississauga - this place is pretty good and it satisfied my skewer cravings! The place is tucked in a corner beside the LA boil in the China Town in Mississauga. 

The skewers were very flavourful - the sauce/spice used to cook all of the skewers is very cumin heavy and they use the spice for everything even the vegetables. I really liked the sauce/spice so I didn't mind. I liked how the skewers weren't the wooden kind - they were stainless steel I believe. Just be really careful when eating and be sure not to poke anyone with the skewers.. the ends can do some damage. I HIGHLY recommend the grilled squid and the beef skewers - they have two spice options for the beef - both are amazing! My friends and I kept ordering these. 

*they only accept cash or debit 
*some of the workers don't speak English"}
