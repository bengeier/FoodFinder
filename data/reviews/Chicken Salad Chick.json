{"text":"The chicken salad is tasty, but their bread is \"blah\" and they don't have the ability to toast. In my opinion, if you're a sandwich shop, you ought to be able to toast bread upon request. I have eaten here 4 times. 3 of the 4 I received great customer service. They have a variety of chicken salads to choose from (check out their menu) & I recommend purchasing them as a scoop, as the bread really takes away from the tastiness of their chicken. As a side note, this would be a great place to go for those of you that don't eat gluten IF something came with the scoops other than club crackers."}
{"text":"The chicken salad was good. They even offered a free cookie with your meal. The soup tasted like water. They need to fix their recipe."}
{"text":"I come here every few weeks because it's convenient to my office, and also tasty. They recently changed the menu so I tried the chicken lemon basil - although it tastes good the first time I ordered I could not find any pecans in it - and I wanted a little crunch.  I tried it again today and asked the attendant if there were pecans in it, as there were none when I ordered it last week - so I ordered it again. Unfortunately, no pecans. Not a big deal but I wanted the nutty flavor and a bit of crunch :-)   Otherwise, it's a tasty lunch and they have options other than chicken salad if you don't want that. Also heard while online that they no longer have sour dough bread. While I never order as a sandwich, the group that was ordering seemed bummed about that."}
{"text":"Disappointed, chicken salad appeared to be run through a blender  We visited for lunch on 11/11/2017 and were interested in tasting different flavors of chicken salad.  We ordered a sandwich, a bowl of potato soup, and two scoops of chicken (Olivia's Old South and Lauryn's Lemon Basil).  What worked:   Menu board listed multiple choices and described them.  Young male attendant behind the counter was friendly and helpful.  Flavor of the lemon basil was good as was the potato soup.  We were able to pick the type of bread for the sandwich.  Why we won't be back:  Expensive for what we received.  For two people our bill was $24.35 - one small sandwich, two very small scoops of chicken on a plate and what equated to a cup of thin soup.  The chicken salad did not have any chunks in it, appeared to be run through a blender (it was more creamy than chunky).  For a place that advertises fresh chicken salad, I can get better chicken salad from my local grocery store that has chunks and does not appear to be more mayonnaise than chicken."}
{"text":"Love this place. Chicken salad on a croissant is perfect plus aaaaaamazing potato soup! Wonderful staff, too. Shout out to Tanisha for her smile and nice welcome. It's the little things like that that make my day."}
{"text":"What an amazing idea for an eatery! I had the BLT with Tuti Fruity - they were \"fresh\" out of the Fancy Nancy (which I want to try!) The savory lemon basil is delicious, too. I don't have a favorite yet - so many to choose from. Will be going regularly -  check it out!"}
{"text":"Bland, overpriced chain. Interior was clean and counter service was friendly. Definitely won't be back. I don't think I'm their customer, but I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Typically I reserve judgement for a 1 star review for multiple factors. Food taste / quality. Service. Ambiance. This one hit it all.   Ambiance is nothing special, nor should it be. It's in the overstreet mall for a quick bite to eat. Ok whatever, no big deal.  Service. They lost my order multiple multiple times. Granted this was within the first 2 weeks of opening, but they had probably 1/4 of the line of Chick-Fil-A. I was told multiple times, they will get my order immediately, to have my order ignored again. Got my food after 30 mins of waiting.  Food. I tried a sample of the chicken salad before ordering. It was the 'classic' and it was not very good at all. I'm not the biggest chicken salad fan, but it did not taste premium at all, it was a little bland. Ok fine, no problem, order something else. I order the roast beef sandwich. IT IS LITERALLY TWO PIECES OF BREAD AND A FEW SLICES OF ROAST BEEF. Wtf? Seriously I just paid $8 for this? Can I get some lettuce? Tomato? Horseradish? Anything else? Was clearly not very good because it was just roast beef and bread. How inventive!!!  Avoid IMO."}
{"text":"The chicken salad is really good. This location is frequently out of something - tomato...lettuce...some type of bread...very frustrating. I don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"Great food served up with gracious southern hospitality. Wonderful experience from the time you step in the door. Lindsay M. the Manager and the entire staff was friendly, attentive and helpful. The food and experience was so much more than anticipated especially considering the price point. Only thing I would want changed would be the availability of wifi. This is definitely my new go to spot for lunch and/or dinner."}
{"text":"Had some high hopes of this place. I'm not saying it's bad but just average at best. You gotta love chicken salad to be a patron but that goes without saying hence the name right!?!? The good thing is that they let you try a couple of samples of their chicken salad prior to ordering. I decided on the southern chicken salad which in my opinion is your classic chicken salad. What I was a little disappointed in was that the actual salad is not lump chicken prices, more a minced salad. On a side note (no pun) the broccoli side salad was awesome!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I had the Classic Carol and Sassy Scotty. First, I guess they don't automatically come with something to eat with it because I just got 2 scoops of chicken salad...no crackers or chips or anything. That was weird because I wasn't asked one way or another even after saying I had never been there before. The Classic Carol is good but could use some dill...so I added some when I got home haha. The Sassy Scotty is good just as it is.   I usually eat at another chicken salad place for lunch over in Dilworth that is one of my favorite places to eat and I'm glad to have found a version over on my side of town"}
{"text":"Mediocre chicken salad that comes in small servings. I order the chicken salad sampler which was beautifully depicted on the menu to have 3 heaping scoops of your choice of chicken salads with 3 types of crackers for $8.99. What we received was 3 piddley ice cream size scoops of our chosen chicken salads with a pile of prewrapped, single serving lance crackers. So as I sat inside the restrauant, I had to unwrap each cracker and make a pile of trash just to feel unsatisfied and still hungry. The redeeming factor of this place is the decor is very original and entertaining. It's a completely FEMALE focused restaurant, even the names of the different chicken salads are cleverly named. Take your aunt or grandma in for a visit, especially if they're southern and over 50"}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum.  I've craved lunch here every single day since my visit. And you know, I've never considered myself a chicken salad fan. Until now!  I ordered with Sassy Scotty with ranch, bacon and cheddar. So awesome. I've been googling my fingers off trying to find a copycat recipe. The grape \"salad\" is a wonderfully sweet dessert disguised as a salad.   Portions are large. The price was fair. The interior is clean and attractive. The service was fast. What's not to love?  And it gets better!  You get a free cookie with your meal:)"}
{"text":"First time getting takeout from this new place. We bought two triple samplers, six scoops of various chicken salads, and some pasta salad. The quality and taste if the chicken salads are extremely good, as is the pasta salad. On the negative side, this very attractive place won't last unless they keep their stock up to the demand (they were out of several types of chick salad, and could not sell any by the pound due to limited quantities). In addition, they were very slow, it took about. 20 minutes to receive my takeout order even though the restaurant was nearly empty. How long can it take to package six scoops and throw in sides of pasta? I hope they improve, the chicken salad is the best I have ever had (all six )."}
{"text":"The quality is high and well prepared with lots of variety of chicken salad. It's surprisingly popular, so that the turnover ensures things are fresh. The side salads are really nice, probably the best items on the menu, but they don't seem to all be available at the same time. Not all the chicken salads are available either, this isn't a bad thing, because I think they do this to ensure they keep things turning over quickly and everything stays fresh. I'm not some chicken salad expert, but this place is, so I bet this is done for a very good reason. I mean if there is such a thing as \"best chicken salad\" then you can be sure this place will win.  Now for the bad and this is going to sound like a stupid thing to complain about, but this place just serves chicken salad. Yeah I know I should have expected this from the name and without a doubt they delivered exactly what they promised, but there isn't much you can do with chicken salad. Even a perfect chicken salad is still just chicken salad. If you go here expecting to experience something different, then you need to be realistic, because you're just getting chicken salad. Think back to the best chicken salad you've ever had in your life and thats what you're going to get. However nobody ever thinks back to how good of a meal they had after it was just chicken salad. People remember bad chicken salad, but good chicken salad is quickly forgotten. I suppose this is why they sell everything by the pound, so you can take it home and eat it when you want a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"For the opening of this location they were doing a promotion that the first 100 customers got free chicken salad for a year. They opened at 10, but they handed out numbers for the first 100 people in line, not customers, several hours before they opened. Those people left and were not in line when the store opened, therefore were not one of the first hundred customers. This made several people in the line angry, who left and will no longer be doing business with a store who does not understand who an actual customer is. The way they handled the promotion demonstrates they do not know how to properly identify and respectfully treat customers or handle a business. I will not be doing business with the disrespectful managers that handled this promotion and store, or any other chicken salad chik, no matter how good the food is. Don't do business with a place so disrespectful to actual customers."}
{"text":"This place is well worth the trip! The venue is large and clean. The decor is super cute. Our waitress was friendly, patient, and helpful. The prices are incredibly reasonable. The menu is expansive. The delivery was super fast. And the food was delicious! All around a great experience. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't even aware there was one of these restaurants in this state. Thought I'd give it a try so I stopped in to get takeout. Very cute restaurant and very clean. Since I'm VERY picky about chicken salad, I tried a small sample of the plain classic first. It was pretty good so I decided to go with the Fancy Nancy which is supposed to have apples, grapes and pecans mixed in. Well if there were any of those items in there I sure couldn't taste it or see it. Seemed to be just plain chicken salad like the sample I had gotten before ordering. It was still good but I was a little disappointed because I wanted more flavor.  I ended up mixing in the grapes from my fruit side just to have some taste. The portion size was a little smaller than expected (I've been to other chicken salad places in AL that serve a larger size) but it was adequate although an hour later I'm hungry again. I looked over the allergen menu and while I'm glad all of their chicken salads are gluten free, I was a little surprised to see that there is MSG in the pimento cheese, two of the chicken salads and two out of the four soups. Would I go back? Probably, but I will request a sample of the Fancy Nancy first to compare with what I received today. If it tastes as plain as today's meal, that will probably be my last visit."}
{"text":"Second time here and both my husband and I love it!! Recommend the Olivia's Old South on toasted wheat. To date my favorite soup is the Chicken Tortilla!!  PS don't forget to taste the sugar cookie with icing, they are a fabulous ending to your meal"}
{"text":"The best chicken salad and the best customer service!  Thank you Tiara for staying open late so I could pick up my chicken salad to take on a family vacation!  Everyone will be so happy!"}
{"text":"Best chicken salad I have ever had at a restaurant and I am picky!!  I went with the classic and it was outstanding... Husband loved it too. Went with fresh fruit as a side and it was a good blend of grapes and strawberries. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Last weekend we did our go to Flip'n Chicken and noticed Chicken Salad Chick in the same shopping center.  We wanted to stop by on Sunday to check it out, but they were closed.  Today we stopped by to get some to go.  We stopped by around 11:30 and had no issues getting the flavors we wanted, and a short wait.  Kevin and I both ordered the three sampler, which is surprisingly a lot of chicken salad, we will likely make three or so meals out of it!  Which is a great deal for $8.95.  Now onto the Chicken Salad: Buffalo Barclay - very mild but great flavor Barbie-Q - slight smokey flavor, good, but not our favorite. Olivia's old south (traditional with egg and pickles) - I liked the traditional flavor, bit still not the favorite Kickin Kay Lynne (buffalo, ranch, bacon, cheese, and jalapenos) - you would think this is a spicy one, but it was also very mild to me.  I didn't taste the bacon or jalapenos so much, it had a similar flavor to the buffalo one.  It had great flavor, probably one of our favorites (good thing we got two scoops of this one!) Pimento cheese - eh, stick to chicken salad.  It was just okay, almost too thick and lacks any kick (I guess you can't be surprised if the buffalo has no kick)  Overall, great place to get different flavored chicken salad at a good value.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This Chicken Salad Chick location has one of the best food service employees I have ever come across. Her name is Tiara. I'm not sure of her exact role at the location, but she was incredibly helpful in my purchasing of 25 gift cards for client gifts for my work. The store didn't have all 25 cards available on the day I called, so Tiara called me back just two days later (exactly like she promised) to complete my order. She even reached out to me multiple times prior to me picking up the cards to confirm and let me know everything was ready for me. And when I went to pick them up, Tiara had a huge smile on her face and even shook my hand. Tiara has the kind of charisma that turns a person's day around. I wish there were more people like her in the world."}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Matthews to try this place for dinner because we heard such good things about it. We arrived at 7:30. We were met inside by a worker who said that the place was closed at 7PM and he just forgot to lock up. Very flippant. Didn't care. The stated hours show closing time at 8PM. We won't be back.  Score: \"F\"."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim. I was impressed with the selection. I got Dixie chick, which was very similar to my family's homemade recipe. The chocolate chip cookies are delicious too! The nutrition content of the food is great, considering the portion size."}
{"text":"So, I LOVE THIS PLACE. I'm a southern girl, so every now and then I get a serious chicken salad craving. My mom doesn't live in town, so when I want something just as yummy, I go to chicken salad chick!! Everything is FRESH and tastes like real fresh food, I love that. The portions are healthy enough to fill you up, and the prices are amazing for what you get. Quality AND quantity. Love the fresh fruit with a scoop of traditional and some crackers. Ugh. I love it all. I just ate it actually. Thank you Chicken Salad Chick!!"}
{"text":"Yummy kelli's chicken salad sandwich on a croissant! I had food to-go and it was delicious. The chicken salad is nicely mixed, just the right amount of mayo, not too much. The kelli flavor has almonds and cranberries which I found refreshing. I chose a pasta salad as my side and they give you the cookie of the day--mine was sugar. For about $9 it seems like a good lunch and homemade food tastes best."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick place for lunch and the cute name and logo had me hooked. If you are a chicken salad lover like me this is the place for you. You have your choice of a number of different kinds of chicken salad-who knew there were so many. There are a few bread options and I went with my chicken salad on a crescent roll.  Each sandwich comes with a choose of a few sides and I picked the pasta salad which may have been the wrong choice as it had way to much dressing.  Maybe I should have stuck with the potato salad.  Since it was lunch I went with the 1/2 sandwich with soup combo and got the soup of the day which was a loaded bake potato. It was delicious! It is a popular lunch spot with take out or dine in options (they even had a few patio seats). I wish they had more of these restaurants as I would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great lunch spot. Staff is normally friendly and the meal comes with a cookie :)"}
{"text":"I love chicken salad, so when I heard about this new place I was really excited to try it. A few coworkers & I went to pick it up for lunch and we all really enjoyed it. I got the chicken salad choice that has bacon, ranch & cheddar, it is really yummy. I also love the grape salad. We have gone back several times since & it's become our fav lunch spot. The only down side is, the place is super small, not a lot of tables and it's always crowded so we always take it to go."}
{"text":"Might have better if I had the food there, but  togo was not great. I believe I was missing bacon tomato onions in my sandwich"}
{"text":"Furious about being ignored.  I went to get lunch as I was craving this places food and stepped up to order only to not be acknowledged, even though there was a female assoc. helping a lady to my left, but 3 workers stood in front of me chatting. I thought maybe I should  step back to the roped off area to be called up. After 5 minutes while another worker joined the \"conversation \" not food ordering of the original lady standing to my left. I was still being  ignored,  no one was in line behind me. Finally out of pure frustration  I took my business across the hall to Energy  Cafe where they always acknowledge me promptly. Extremely rude & unacceptable!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but a great place to go when I need something a little different. I love all the different options (Fancy Nancy is great),  and highly recommend getting the bread toasted on your sandwich.  The grape salad is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Lunch with a friend. I got Fancy Nancy. It was tasty, but the 2 grapes in the scoop were whole and there was only one chunk of pineapple. Personal preference, but I'd rather the fruit be a bit smaller. Won't keep me from ordering it again =) Also had the broccoli salad sans bacon. Delish. Great lunch or light dinner restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has been open in Overstreet Mall for a few weeks. The line has been consistently long, and today I decided the take a late lunch and wait for the line to dissipate. Boy, I'm glad that I did.  If you like chicken salad, this is your place.   If you like big portions, look no further.  I tried the Kickin' Kay Lynne on a croissant which had  buffalo sauce, ranch, bacon, shredded cheddar cheese & jalapenos in it. Moist, and loaded with delicious flavor. I got the grape salad and broccoli salad to accompany my sandwich. Both I would give hard 5/5s for. The broccoli salad was probably one of the best I've ever had from a restaurant; the broccoli wasn't too raw, nor was it too cooked either. PERFECTION.   But wait, you want more? All this food and you still get a pickle and a cookie. Seriously ... a sandwhich, two sides, a pickle & a cookie for $8.50. Stop reading now and go get in line!"}
{"text":"Yummy delicious chicken salad and pimento cheese.   The soups are lovely as well.  Don't forget a buttercream cookie.  You get a small one with your meal but I recommend taking another home for a treat later.  Go enjoy this charming restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time eating at one of these was in Columbia while on business.  Well I was impressed with tastiness and staff's friendliness, so decided to try the one in my own backyard.  On the outside and inside- decor is the same. The staff ,with the exception of a young African-American guy, looked disinterested and tired. The one guy had smiles and was very knowledgeable of the menu. He even provided recommendations for unsure patrons. He needs some of his sunshine to rub off on his co-workers.  :) Ordered Dixie Chick and despite having the heavy onion flavor just tasted not fresh and watery. Maybe been in the fridge a day too many and the croissant was stale. Oh well who needs carbs..lol. Probably will go back, but not make a special trip."}
{"text":"I love chicken salad!! I'm not a fan of chicken salad with nuts and fruit. I just want to taste the chicken and mayo. Chicken salad chick had a great variety of chicken salad and I was pleased that the original had the ingredients that I love in a good chicken salad. I had the original chicken salad on a croissant. I was pleasantly surprised with a sugar cookie. I had to scrape the frosting off the cookie because I am not big on sweet. But it was good. I will return when I'm in the Charlotte area again."}
{"text":"What a fabulous idea. From pa visiting nc and .stubbled across the only #chickensaladchick in the state. Very tasty I wish the line wouldnt have moved so fast to figure out which salad to try."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and I'm already the \"Duchess!\" :-D Last time we had the three scoops to share with a croissant and it came to about $12! That's what I call a \"cheap date.\" We both love the jalapeño holly. Not too spicy with a great flavor. We also tried the fancy Nancy with the grapes, pecans and apples...I liked that one as well. And we also ordered Olivia's old south. Everything was so fresh. I had mine with crackers. He ate the cookie and pickle [Insert twisted face here!] This visit two scoops of jalapeño and one of Olivia's. Going on a class field trip and thought it would be great to bring for lunch.   I can see myself here too often. I just wish they stayed open a little later but I guess that requires better planning on my part."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go! I find myself craving chicken salad chick almost every week and can't help but go back. Even though it's a twenty minute drive from my house it is always worth it. I've been a customer for almost a year and I've never had a problem with this location or any other location I've been to. The only think I wish was that their points program was more rewarding. Other than that, however, chicken salad chick is amazing!"}
{"text":"I popped in here for a takeaway lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the speed and quality of food they serve here. Yes, their main staples are chicken salad, so keep that in mind if it isn't your go-to. That being said, even if you are in the fence give this place a go. I ended up getting the classic (hey - I wanted to see what got this chain rolling in the first place) with a side of grape salad.  Presentation and flavors were both above what I expected! I had a free half of a chicken salad sandwich from jasons deli just the previous day and this blew it out of the water. Plus you also get a pickle spear and small cookie with a combo, a bonus at the price point. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We had a less than satisfying experience at Chicken Salad Chick today.  We were there about 4:00, so the restaurant wasn't very busy at all.  There were only two tables with customers, however, every table we chose to sit at, was dirty!  We tried five tables before we settled on a \"least dirty\" table.  As I looked around the restaurant, the tablecloths were all crooked and the floor was littered with trash.  The restaurant appeared to be overstaffed because there were an abundance of employees but none of them seemed to working.  Although we ordered our sandwiches to be toasted, they came out not toasted.  We were told that the toaster just broke. It would have been nice if they asked if we were okay with untoasted bread or if we would have preferred a croissant.  The employee who brought our food out said that she would have the manager come over to our table.  The manager offered to remake our sandwiches because the toaster miraculously just started working again!  She also wanted to refund our money for the sandwiches but we told her that that wasn't necessary.  She insisted.  Just before we left, I noticed an employee putting paper on the food trays and stacking them on top of each other.  I wouldn't mind that so much if the trays were being washed and/or sanitized, however, they weren't.  So, the bottom of a dirty tray, which has been who-knows-where and touched by who-knows-what.... is being stacked on paper where food will be placed!  I doubt that we will go back."}
{"text":"I went to this location for the grand opening. The first 100 people in line got a free large chick a month for a year. The first persons entry is incorrect, at 9am we were handed fans that had 1 thru 100 on them. Some people went and sat in their cars after that or went to grab a bite at a food place in the same parking lot. Some of us had been there since 5 or 6 am weathering Irma so by 9 am we were hungry. Aside from that, the focus should be on the fact that the food is delicious and the staff was extremely pleasant! I highly recommend Chicken Salad Chick."}
{"text":"First time trying the chicken salad chick and I'm hooked. It's a amazing place to get chicken salad. You can sample all there chicken salads and find the perfect match for you. I got the Sassy Scotty and was amazed at the rich flavor. I also had there Grape Salad and omg words can't describe how delicious it is. The staff are very helpful and friendly. My favorite part is that you can take a pound home with you. I'm in love!!!!"}
{"text":"I have only been there once. My ham sandwich was not much. Ham that was average, a lettuce leaf and tomato. Nothing else. I got it to go and wasn't told if there were condiments somewhere in the place. No napkin. Just a bland sandwich in a bag. I was asked, \"what side?\" without knowing it was an additional charge.   I don't know, it seems you should expect a complete dish unless you are told otherwise."}
{"text":"What's better on a hot spring day than a cold salad ? Chicken Salad Chick  was just the place to go for a delicious cold dinner !   Once inside the cute decorated restaurant we found ourselves in a real predicament trying to choose what delicious salad to have for dinner.   After tasting several I finally chose the trio ~ a scoop of  delicious dill, a scoop of egg salad and a tricolor pasta salad.   It was delicious. Seriously so delicious!  The hubs had the cranberry chicken salad and pimento cheese salad and grape salad.  The flavors were on point and the portions filled me up .   I have to admit when I looked at the plate when it was brought to our table, I thought it was not going to be enough but seriously - I was stuffed ! It was more than enough and I couldn't eat the complimentary cookie !   This will definitely become my favorite summer lunch or dinner stop as I loved every single salad I taste tested!  Chicken Salad Chick has got the goods .... Stop in and get a taste of any of their salads and you'll understand why I'll be checking in here a lot !  You're welcome!!!!"}
{"text":"if you could give half stars, guess I'd go 2.5 stars, but not 3, yes I've experienced better, but it'snot really \"A-OK\" either. This was my first time, I walk past it 2 or 3 times a week and decided to try something different today... I had the Cajun Roast Beef ... to me \"Cajun\" implicates some sort of spices ... there was Roast Beef, not much  but no spices to call this \"Cajun\" ... so in a nutshell the sandwich: - Very Little Meat - Very Little in the condiments (Lettuce Tomato Mayo Mustard) -  A slice of Provolone Cheese - The sourdough bread it comes on was dry and didn't taste much like \"good\" sourdough bread Came with a side ... I chose the Pasta Salad, what little there was of it, the little slot in the box where the pasta salad went was maybe half full (being optimistic here), and as pasta salads go .... i'd give it maybe a 2, probably a 1.5... Also a cookie ... that was by far the best part of the meal ... and of course the dill pickle slice..  Wasn't the worst food I've ever had in a fast food, food court but by far not the best either.  On the bright side, some of the staff was friendly and professional, the rest were just kind of hanging out...  Probably will by-pass it as i did before trying it, just not any bang for your buck...too expensive for too little..."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to eat! Love the grape salad with walnuts. Love the buffalo chicken it's great if you like a bit spice."}
{"text":"Very good!!! unique place. Chix salad was good. Wish the bread had been better. Will definitely be heading back."}
{"text":"I'm picky when it comes to chicken salad as I don't care for big chunks of celery or onion, did not need to worry this was perfect for me.  I love all the different options and that they let you sample before ordering.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Surprisingly really loved this place. I am not a person who generally likes things in their chicken salad but I really wanted to check this place out. I got the trio sampler with Luau Lydia (pineapple and macadamia nuts), Cranberry Kelli (cranberry and almonds) and Mimi's mix (apples and cashews). They were all very good but the Cranberry Kelli was my favorite.   The one and only reason for 4 stars versus 5 stars is they do NOT put enough fruit in their chicken salad. We got maybe 3 pieces of fruit per scoop. Enough to let you know that if they put a proper amt in their it would be amazing! There is a lack of balance between nuts, fruit, and chicken salad. if they got that straightened out I would 100% give them 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"not sure if it was because it came in as part of a boxed lunch for an event my team was catering but somehow the bread was so dry & the pimento cheese was like a massive lump that I thought ok let me try to eat it like pub cheese w/crackers.  The cracker stuck out of the pimento cheese like a flag to stake a claim.  The dressing on the pasta salad was overwhelming.  The salad was supposed to exclude the banana peppers & it was if it went the opposite direction as extra peppers.  I wanted to love it given it is just down from my office in Founder's Hall & it seems pricey for what it is so wanted to see if the flavors justified the price.  Unfortunately, this particular experience doesn't inspire me to order again for catering nor add it to my list of go to lunch spots."}
{"text":"Love it!   Was introduced by a friend and had to bring my husband who loved it as well.  Tried the broccoli salad, grape salad and the baked potato soup, all as yummy as the chicken salad.  There's something for everyone between sweet, fruity and savory and everyone gets a little sugar cookie to end their meal with.   The only thing I don't like is the parking lot."}
{"text":"The curry chicken salad is so good. Old south and Scotty flavors are good too. The grape salad side is a nice sweet treat."}
{"text":"I love the name.  And it is an appropriate name as chicken salads are the name of the game here.  They have a wonderful and zany menu of many variations.  And they will give  you samples to help you make up your mind.    Choose your bread or go for a bed of lettuce.  Choose the chicken concoction and they make it upon ordering.  You leave the ordering counter and the challenge is finding a table.  There ain't many, so though cozy and cute, it is tough to find a seat to eat.  Not eat the seat, but...you know.  There are sides like pasta and potato salads, and any of the sides can be ordered as your main course.  Chicken is white meat chicken only, so fussy people like my wife are happy.  I am just fine with dark meat, though.  Popular and have to say it is quite a ladies place.  Very popular and murder during lunchtime prime time."}
{"text":"Last week was my first time eating here and it was really good. I ordered the original and then a fruity chicken salad - they were both so delicious. The service was quick, so I will be back again."}
{"text":"Chicken salad = mayo, right? Well I'm not a big fan of mayo, but I love chicken salad chick! Fortunately, their salads are not over powerful on the mayo and they have plenty of options to pick from- nearly 10 different kinds.   My favorites are the Kickin Kay Lynne and the Jalapeño Holly. Hey I like things HOT ;-)  They also offer a trio dish that comes with a sample of 3 different salads served with crackers and a pickle. I usually opt for this because I get to try a variety of different salads. I always get the Lynne and Holly, then try a new one. The next top contender for me is the buffalo chicken salad. Surprise, surprise!   Ps-this place is never packed! So it's a great fast lunch option for anyone working in uptown."}
{"text":"Charming little spot and they have a location in uptown. The traditional southern styles sell out in uptown around lunch (Olivia's) so go early."}
{"text":"This was one of the best chicken salad sandwiches I've had EVER! The wheat bread was moist and soft, the chicken salad was the right balance is sweet and savory. I could total eaten another half sandwich with joyful bliss.  The service was great too. I guess the guy at te counter could tell I was a true southerner and as I looked at the menu he pointed to the Olivia. Thank goodness for him b/c it was Great! I hope my mom doesn't read this"}
{"text":"I didn't know about Chicken Salad Chick and happened to see it while visiting the Fresh Market next door. So, I dropped in to give it a try!  First, the counter staff was very friendly and helpful!  There are so many different options on their menu for chicken salad with various seasonings and flavors! (Personally, I'm perplexed with some of the reviews here that focus on recipe for a particular type chicken salad!  For heaven's sake, they only have 15 different salads! If you picked one that was bland, you shoulda' tried it first and picked another!) They offer free samples to make sure you get the recipe that's right for you! I settled on the Chick Trio so that I could enjoy several. I personally selected Barbie-Q, Olivia's Old South, and Jalapeno Holly. All were very good and I would order them again. My favorite (so far, having only tried 3!) was the Jalapeno Holly - perfect balance of jalapeno; not overpowering. Now, the price per pound is a little high compared to chicken salad you get in other places. But, BUT, you're in a restaurant where you can pick and choose from lots of recipes to get that salad that you desire most! I like that!!  AND, frankly, I pay more when I order chicken salad on a sandwich anywhere else, or but it by the scoop from the nearby deli! So, I'm fine with their prices given the selection and the quality. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Well the food is good but can you trust it? We we brought the wrong food and we picked it up before noticing it. The runner brought the food back to the window and put the right chit on it and took THE SAME FOOD! to another table. Yes the food we touched!! I told the people who got the food what happened as well as the manager. We will not be back to this gross establishment."}
{"text":"Very good spot. Menu is limited to mostly chicken salad, but it works. Except that to me chicken salad requires toast & they don't toast! I have tried multiple chicken salads which were all good. Grape salad was also a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"After hearing first-handed accounts of this restaurant from friends and coworkers, my friend and I decided to give it a try...  Five stars! The food is delicious and very fresh-tasting. The interior of the restaurant is clean. It's pretty amazing!!!  I almost forgot - the staff! Very friendly! My order was correct upon receipt and a staff member checked on us three times; she asked if I needed a box (I stopped eating to take a picture and to write about this experience!!!).  I'll definitely be back! Great job!"}
{"text":"Just wow! Gentleman, be wary, your wife or girlfriend will drag you here and it is definitely a girls place to eat and hang! The inside was clean and amazingly decorated. Lunches are hectic so make sure to get there early or at the right time! Our wait was short, the menu is easy to follow and the chicken salad was THE bomb dot com. Runs laps around Harris Teeter and store brand chicken salad. Broccoli salad was good too! We had the fruity salad and the original salad options. Will return again, with out the boyfriend and will make sure to bring my gal pals!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to college at Auburn in Lee County, Alabama (where it all began), so I know all about Chicken Salad Chick! I was pleasantly surprised when I saw a location a few years ago in Ballantyne and even more pleasantly surprised when I saw this one in Concord only about five minutes from my house!  I love a good homemade chicken salad, but I also love the spin the CSC puts on theirs. I'm partial to the Jalapeño Holly - to get a little spice in my life. My wife and I both also love the Fancy Nancy with the Fuji Apple pieces. The staff here has been quite friendly during my two visits and they are more than willing to walk you through the menu if you have any questions."}
{"text":"Wandered through here by curiosity and was pleasantly surprised with everything! Luckily for me, I didn't have to wait long the two times I've been here. During lunch rush it can get really busy. Service was helpful and great. I ordered their Dixie chick chicken salad, I believe. I can say it was a really tasty sandwich! It came with your choice of side and a cookie! I'd love to order the rest of their other options, but I'm hooked on the Dixie chicken salad! Can't wait to come back again here soon!"}
{"text":"I have never been a big chicken salad fan. But, this place will make you rethink that! Amazing flavor and substantial portions. Very reasonable price and worth every penny. I will definitely be back for some chicken salad."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Delicious chicken salad with lots of variety to choose from. Soup was great- chicken artichoke. Wow! And the cookies are to die for! This is my new favorite place! Very unique- friendly staff- clean environment. I highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"I am so glad there is a Chicken Salad Chick closer to me now!I frequented this restaurant often when I resided in AL.This location met my expectations and I was pleased (great customer service,food served quickly,nice presentation,etc.).Parking can be a little difficult as there are other popular businesses in the same shopping center.  If you haven't been before,I recommend you try the grape salad as your side.It is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I've been back since with my fiancé and our five kids... we love it and the ordering process wasn't bad this time.  It is seriously my favorite place. I could eat here literally everyday!!"}
{"text":"Visited here several times since I work in a nearby building.  At first I thought it would be one of my weekly stops for lunch. But, it turned out not to be the case.  In my opinion, you don't get much for the price.  I usually get the Gourmet Chick with a scoop of chicken salad.  I don't like the sandwich.  As someone said earlier, the bread takes away from the taste.  I do like their broccoli salad.  Their fruit is mediocre.  It's mainly grapes with a few blueberries and half of one strawberry sliced.  They give you a cookie with every meal.  I have a sweet tooth but I am not a fan of their cookies.  Have had much better elsewhere. I like the decoration in this restaurant.  It's upbeat with a southern flare.  The staff have always been pleasant and one even remembers my name."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of chicken salad, but came along with a group that was. They have a few sandwiches for those who do not like chicken salad, but I decided to give their namesake a shot and was pleasantly surprised.  I had the buffalo chicken salad on a croissant. Pretty good, but not as spicy as I was wishing for. I'll try the one with jalapeños next time. There are a few bread options for the sandwich and some classic sides to choose from. Their pasta salad and broccoli salad are my favorite. The combo also comes with a cookie; pretty good deal for right around $8.   It is a pretty large space by Overstreet standards. Plenty of seating - booths, tables, bar seating against the window. Looks like they will be sticking around for a while with the line they draw during the lunch hours."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place out because finally there was no line. The newest offering in Overstreet Mall stays true to it's name specializing in Chicken Salad. I forgot to count how many different ways they can make their chicken salad but I went with the Southern version (with egg and pickle). It allowed me to taste their base chicken salad with just a little addition to it.  Sadly I was not really blown away. They have one thing they specialize in and in my opinion is there are two places right near by that do their staple better.  But, to each their own and I do recommend at least giving it a try. You might have different tastes. It wasn't bad or anything and the staff was super friendly. Plus, there are a lot of different ways for you to try their chicken salad.  However, with lunch being near $10 and feeling underwhlemed, I will personally probably pass next time."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food every time. Not 5 stars though because this is the WORST location in terms of NO parking. The lot was so full. I realize there are several other businesses, restaurants and a grocery store but it seems like terrible planning. I would go more often if I could park. *edit response to owner* Yes- I'm very willing to walk several rows...and I tried like 4 rows over. I used to live in SF with no car, walking is not the issue. I ended up parking behind the building. I will try again another night, noting that I went at 7:30 on Friday night."}
{"text":"1st time here and was very impressed.  I got the Chick Trio, which is a great value. I ordered the Buffalo Barclay and the Fancy Nancy salads and the grape salad. My husband ordered the Kicking Kay Lynne on sourdough with a pasta salad.   Chick Trio- great value! You get a decent scoop of salad. Only give you 6 crackers, but I feel if I asked for more they would have no problem. I found there was a slightly lack of seasoning in both. Not a lot of Buffalo flavor and lacking some salt and pepper in the fancy Nancy. Overall good. Since hubby and I both got buffalo we asked for some buffalo sauce and they brought us some extra sauce on the side.The sauce is awesome! Wish they would have added more of it to the salad, but very easy to just add to whatever you are eating. The grape salad is amazing and I very much wanted to lick the cup when I was done.  Sandwich- Sourdough bread was wonderful, soft fluffy perfect. Once again once the Buffalo sauce was added it was a perfect sandwich.  Pasta salad was very flavorful and very good.   Portion sizes are great for the price. Service was very quick and responsive.  Overall great place and will be back."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here. My sisters and I had lunch. The atmosphere is so nice. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. They let you sample before buying. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area at lunch time and saw this little restaurant; so my dining mate and I had  lunch there . A light and bright atmosphere. One ordered at the counter. It was busy during lunch mostly women patrons . Chicken salad is the featured food . One can get a  variety of chicken salad such as  traditional ,savory  fruity and nutty and spicy varieties of chicken salad  This restaurant offers other  green, pasta and fruit salads, soups , turkey, egg salad and pimento  cheese  sandwiches, macaroni and cheese,  beverages   such as  tea ,cola and lemonade. We ordered the barbecue chicken salad atop greens . It was delicious with a slight smoky flavor, creamy but not overpowered by mayonnaise. We would certainly have lunch there again and try a different type of chicken salad and  a cup of soup . Prices were reasonable, food was brought to your table after you ordered at the counter, served  in take home disposable containers if you didn't finish your salad . Really a nice eatery for chicken salad lovers ."}
{"text":"The food is great, I love the Broccoli Salad that is the only reason I ever keep coming back. Well and for the fact when you work uptown you eat at all the same places most of the time anyways. The Service is TERRIBLE though! Now don't get me wrong, no one is really ever rude at all but the wait time for your food is terribly slow and they mess it up all the time.   They just gave the whole place a make over this week probably because they never have a line and hoped to get more customers in there but the menu and design wasn't the problem. The lack of urgency or care that people might have to get back to work is the problem. On top of that their menu prices went up a ridiculous amount, which is going to make people not want to come even more since they are paying 11 dollars and some change for a sandwich and two sides.   Todays experience.. Went downstairs to finally get lunch at about 330, clearly a slow time so there was absolutely no line at all. Seriously I was the only person in line. My order was a Chicken Salad Sandwich with no tomato and lettuce add Provolone Cheese, with two sides of Broccoli Salad with two side cups of the dressing for the Broccoli Salad.   I waited 15 minutes for my food, literally 15 minutes for a sandwich that does not require to be cooked at all and two sides that are cold items so they require no heating up. Oh before I got my food a little bit after I ordered probably about 5-6 minutes later they told me they didn't have the chicken salad I ordered. Ok that's cool, no big deal, but why did it take that long to realize it when there is literally NO ONE in the store getting food before me. But that's cool. Get my food, check the box (literally just checked it for one thing.. the gold of all the food in there my side cups of the Broccoli dressing..yes I love this stuff, this is why I keep coming back) It was not in there. Ok cool that's fine shouldn't take them long to get it. Oh yea, 10 minutes to get two cups of broccoli salad dressing. WHAT?? so now we are looking at what, 25 minutes in the store at a time that was dead..That was my entire lunch break, thanks! Get back to my desk, come to find out that there was no Provolone Cheese on my sandwich that they charged me 50 cents for. Not mad I got charged but I just paid 11 dollars for a sandwich that isn't right. AND I didn't get a free cookie? What they charge more now for food but aren't giving out free cookies.. The madness.. I just don't understand.. Because it took so long for my food I couldn't even go back downstairs to get my cheese or cookie.,..   Its such a shame, I love Chicken Salad Chick, I have been to the other one off Pineville Matthews and its great, love the food. But the service at this one uptown is just so awful, I would rather stand in that terrible Chick Fila Lunch hour line than take the amount of time I would at this location. The Service needs to step it up for this place to survive uptown... maybe that location is just bad luck since the last couple places closed down also in the last 10 years."}
{"text":"The dill Chicken salad is good not as silly as I would like it. However the broccoli salad/side is outstanding. The wife got the bacon one with cheese, how I missed that on the menu is beyond me. That is an amazing salad, highly recommend it to all who visit."}
{"text":"I love this place. I just went in there last week because I'm meh about chicken salad but didn't realize the menu was more extensive than chicken salad.  The atmosphere is happy and inviting and I feel very happy in there. I don't know if it's the yellow walls or what?  The lady working behind the counter was such a delight. She was so nice and so sweet.  I loved her.  The chicken salad is delicious. They have a lot of lower carb options there as well! I'm going to try the egg salad next time."}
{"text":"Love this place the food was amazing! The service was fast and please eat the grape salad yummy"}
{"text":"Soooo delish!! I purchased the cranberry Kelli and it has so much flavor.. the cranberries get it a nice sweet and almonds give it that crisp.. you have to go and check it out!"}
{"text":"We went in with pretty low expectations... Honestly. But boy oh boy were we surprised! The service was helpful and friendly. Both of the chicken salad options were wonderful (classic Carol and fancy Nancy.)  The sides were equally great. The broccoli and grape salad were both fresh and not overdressed! We will be using these guys for events and lunch time and time again!"}
{"text":"I love the one with BBQ and their potato salad is everything.... the combos are really decent and their tuna will please all of the taste buds of your palate"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! I have ate at ones in Florida and Alabama and was super excited to get one here local!!! I love chicken salad and the options of having a different one to fit what flavor I want that day is such a wonderful food experience. I have ate at this one several times, purchased the prepared chicken salads from the \"to go\" cooler and each and every time the staff have been friendly, helpful and patient while I make that hard choice...seriously who can pick just one...so lets pick three...and even then there are so many more I want because they are just so good!!!  Consistent in taste so you know you get a quality food product each and every time you come to eat at the Chicken Salad Chick!  My absolute favorite is the Dixie Chick (the most offensive salad because of all the delicious onions!!!).  Download the app and earn points toward free stuff!!"}
{"text":"I don't come here that often because this place has the misfortune of being next to Chick-fil-a, so whenever I want chicken, I usually go there. This place is rarely crowded though so I think a lot of people feel the same way as me.   The chicken salad is really good! I've tried Classic Carol, Fancy Nancy and Fruity Fran. I WANTED to try Olivia's Old South, but they were out when I ordered it.   If you love chicken salad and also don't want to deal with the Chick-fil-a line, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Love their chicken salad and all of he variety. I like the croissants and getting it by the pound. Favorite is probably Fancy Nancy, but everything I've tried is gold."}
{"text":"Not a chicken salad lover at all but I went here today for the first time and was so impressed. In addition to the many choices they had the place was clean and the service was friendly. They even have options for non chicken salad lovers like myself but I encourage you to sample as many chicken salads as you like until you find one you like. And if you're a chicken salad lover this is your spot!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Best chicken salad I've ever had!! You can get two sides with your chicken salad sandwich plus it comes with the cookie of the day which is really good! love this place"}
{"text":"Best. Lunch. Spot. EVER. Seriously, if you're a chicken salad fanatic like me, you'll love this quick spot. Jalapeño Holly is a must-have; not too spicy, just a nice little kick. Olivia's Old South is a great addition to even out the spice if you're a bit of a spice baby. The broccoli salad is always a good choice, as well."}
{"text":"If you're 90 years old with no teeth, you'll be heaven!  Okay, the office decided to try this place and placed an order to go. Once at the office we found that the order was wrong, but it was too much trouble to go get it fixed, so we decided to just eat it. The macadamia nuts tasted like dirt. Literally. It was also the only texture at all. I have actually had mashed potatoes with more texture. Maybe in addition the wrong order, they forgot to put chicken in it.  Next time I'll just bring Costco's cape cod chicken salad from home. It is far better and contains actual pieces of chicken. (I recommend it on their croissants)   We will not go back."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here on my way back to Columbia from Charlotte. I came here during lunch time and there was no wait. 5 out of 5 stars. Food was fresh and well prepared. I got the Fruity Fran (1 scoop) with fruit bowl. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! I was pleasantly surprised. Ordered the Dixie chicken salad on a croissant with grape salad. Y'all it was very good. Don't expect large portions. DO expect an evenly portioned delicious sandwich combo"}
{"text":"Not worth the 15 minute wait for one chicken salad sandwich. That's a sandwich only with no sides. The sandwich was bland with no flavor. Not sure what the 5 star people were served, but the stale white bread chicken and mayo mixture sandwich that I received was not worth the money or time wasted. I will just go next door to Chic-fil-a from now on. It's clear why there is never a line during the lunch rush for this place. There are much better places literally feet from this place. Do yourself a favor and pick any of those."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Judge me because I just don't get it.  I like chicken salad as much as the next girl.  It is incredibly easy to make.  I had the scoops at this place and they were fine.  Nothing blew my mind.  I got the traditional one and Buffalo style.  Buffalo style was not spicy, not until after I ate all of it did I even detect spice.  Chicken salad tends to be bland, these are no exception.  I was expecting some devilishly clever take on a very simple food.  Instead I got a straightforward $4 a scoop food.  I don't eat sugars and lots of carbs so chicken salad works for me.  I can't figure out why I shouldn't go get a lbs of chicken salad from any grocery store.  I don't know why I shouldn't buy chicken at under $1 a lbs at many grocery stores and buy some Dukes or Helmans mayonnaise and make my own chicken salad for a fraction of the cost.  Like I said in the opener - I don't get it.  If you offered me a free meal from here for a year I wouldn't go very often because the 8 minute drive isn't worth it.  I could more easily make it myself and not travel.  The place was clean and bright.  I asked the girl working the counter two questions and she knew neither.  I asked if the items were low carb and if they take Google pay.  It is and they don't."}
{"text":"Good chicken salad plates, sometimes they forget the cookie and you have to remind them, but the food has always been good. Love the broccoli salad!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch to go.  Staff was friendly, prices very reasonable, and food was delicious! Very fresh.  I got the Classic Carol on a croissant.  I loved that my lunch came with a yummy little buttercream cookie! Any place that believes dessert should be a part of lunch wins me as a customer! :).  Only complaint I have about the place is that my to go order included a styrofoam tray and styrofoam cup. Would be nice to see some more environmentally friendly options..."}
{"text":"I had the original scoop and potato soup. The chicken salad was very good. Tasty and perfect consistency. The soup was ok. I can't wait to try other options of chicken salad. It is pricey for small portions."}
{"text":"My second time visiting this eatery and took a friend who had never tried it. She got the Dixie Chick chicken salad with loaded baked potato soup but they were out of that soup so they got the broccoli and cheese soup instead. She enjoyed it and actually got filled up eating half the chicken salad sandwich and the soup. I had the broccoli cheese soup as well and it was very cheesy. I definitely enjoy the chicken salad on a croissant which is nice an flaky."}
{"text":"What? Two days in a row for lunch? Yep, that's what a couple coworkers and I did!   Looking for something that was a little different than our normal lunch spots, I came across CSC on Yelp ... of course! Where else? You place your order at the front counter and you are given a table flag to place in sight while seated and waiting for your meal to be prepared and brought out to you.  There have a fountain soda machine as well as sweet/unsweetened teas and a lemonade dispense for your liquid pleasure. It would definitely be nice if they offered more fresh teas and/or lemonades like a lot of fresh food places.  We came to the conclusion that this place is fantastic and we will be back .. and by that we meant obviously the next door. Crazy. Good job, Chick. There are so many options of chicken salad and pimento cheese to choose from, as well as a handful of side choices. I don't think a bad decision can be made. If you're good enough, they might even slip a cookie on your plate as an after meal treat! Yum.  Don't forget to download their Rewards App on your mobile device. It's worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at in the area. What a refreshing change from the same old restaurants we've been having around the area. This place has amazing chicken salads and sandwiches. My favorite is the Kickin' Kay Lynn salad. You can get any of their salads in a sandwich. I also especially like the grape salad. It's like dessert with its cream cheese \"dressing.\" The combo meals are always perfect for lunches or dinners. Can't wait to see this business grow stronger than ever."}
{"text":"Cute place and lots of options. Staff was nice and helpful. It was my first time going and they let me sample some chicken salad. I got the trio. They were all good. Large scoops. I actually had leftovers. My favorite is the Dixie chick. I think that's what the name of it was but it had lots of onions and it was so flavorful!"}
{"text":"Chicken salad was very good.  Something different from the usual restaurants.  We had three scoops all different.  The jalapeno was the best in my opinion followed by the old south and finally the Fancy Nancy.  The place is new and very clean and the staff was helpful in making a choice of what to order.  I will Definately come back here for a healthy reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Love the food but the service is not very good. I feel like they are always scattered. I got a large quick-chick to go and there were none on the shelf. They said they'd get one for me real quick, and I sat there for a long time waiting. It shouldn't take that long to scoop some chchicken salad into a container. I wouldn't post a bad review except the service is never good when I go."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I'm highly disappointed.  I've been looking forward to going because I love chicken salad and they have so many different ones.  Today I ordered the classic Nancy chicken salad and the broccoli cheddar soup. Both were very bland.  How do you mess up broccoli cheddar soup?! The chicken salad wasn't any better. I'm very grateful the chicken salad was free but I would've definitely wanted a refund on the $3 soup! I only gave it two stars because the establishment is cute."}
{"text":"Love this place! The chicken salads are delicious and first timers are able to try before you buy. I always get the trio meal and try new flavored each time."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 or 3 times. Each time I have tried a different kind of chicken salad and they have all been very, very bland. Even after trying to doctor it up myself with a little pepper and salt it was still pretty flavorless. I was extremely disappointed because I LOVE chicken salad but there are many other places around Charlotte that offer a much better tasting one.  The chicken tortilla soup and potato soup tasted better than the chicken salad! Also, the last time I went I ordered the grape salad as a side and found a plastic wrapper in it."}
{"text":"Oh my goshhh!  Chicken Salad heaven!! All white meat chicken.  The jalapeño holy & Cranberry Kelli is where it's at!!    Perfect for lunch, I'm going back to get the pound."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that a Chicken Salad Chick in now open in Concord. They have them in my hometown and in Uptown Charlotte. I never wanted to go uptown to deal with traffic. The staff was so sweet and friendly. Especially Joey. He is a sweetheart. As for the food, I have tried all of the chicken salads and today I got my favorite the Fancy Nancy on wheat."}
{"text":"YIKES ON BIKES this place is awesome!  Seriously, it is an obsession right now.  My son works in the plaza and I have to pick him up every Thursday night so this has become a thing.  We are way past talking, Chicken Salad Chick and I are in a committed relationship!  I have tried about half of the menu.  Their fruity chicken salads are my favorite.  I just love the mix of sweet, crunchy and savory.  Their sandwiches come on white, wheat or a croissant.  All three are delicious.  The grape salad is saaaaaweet so don't order it if you don't like sugar LOL.  The pasta salad is very tasty and well balanced.  I will say that it can get pretty pricey when you order a sandwich, two sides and a drink as everything is a la carte.  I usually order a sandwich with one side and a fountain water which rings out to just under 8 bucks.  I typically only eat half the sandwich so I end up saving it for the next day for lunch.  They offer vitamin water on their fountain machine which is rare and very much welcomed.  I do not drink carbonated beverages or sweet juices so more often than not, my only choices are water or unsweet tea when I eat out.  They also serve lemons on their bar which is a nice touch for my plain fountain water.  The decor is super colorful and fun!  I just love those matching little red flowers on the walls and tea containers.  The only downside that I can find to Chicken Salad Chick is that they close at 8.  I work until 7 on Thursdays so it is a mad dash to get there from Downtown Concord with traffic before they close.  The staff is always very friendly, helpful and polite.  They are never rude of annoyed by us last minute customers and there are a lot of us which lessens my guilt as I await the impending deliciousness  :)  I do apologize to them over and over for being last minute from beginning to end, but I have to get my fix!"}
{"text":"Hits and misses. Popped in for a quick lunch on a Saturday afternoon. No line and pretty empty inside. Not sure what other reviews meant by limited seating. I thought there was ample. You order up front, and they deliver to you or you can grab as take out. There's a cooler up front with grab and go bowls of the different flavors of chicken salad if you are in a rush.  I tried a gourmet chick meal, which comes with  your choice of a sandwich or scoop, two sides, a pickle, and a small cookie. I also ordered a bowl of the loaded potato soup.   For my sandwich, I had the Mimi's Mix on a croissant, which was cashews and apples mixed in the chicken salad. The croissant was tasty, but the chicken salad was so, so dry! And it was thinly spread on the croissant, so a bit of a let down in terms of portion size for price. I tried the grape salad and broccoli salad for my sides. The grape salad was good though it could have used a bit more nut topping. The broccoli salad had a weirdly sweet dressing. I wouldn't get it again if I came back. The cookie and the potato soup were the highlights of the meal."}
{"text":"Totally cute spot! Great chicken salad! Pasta salad could use some zing, but all and all...very flavorful food in a super sweet atmosphere. Will definately be back. I cant wait to try their pimento cheese..."}
{"text":"I love chicken salad. But this was just \"ok.\"   Francy Nancy with apples, pecans and seedless grapes on a croissant.   They blend the chicken salad so it's like a spread. I prefer chunk (or whole) chicken salad.   It seems they just mass blend it and then insert whatever the specialty flavor is in. The grapes, apples and nuts were not blended.  They give you a fair amount. Flavor is bland. Not exciting. Didn't wow me.   The cookie was a lemon cookie and from a pre-made square. Wish they could at least make those inhouse since every meal gets one.   I might return but I won't go out of my way. I prefer Panera Chicken Salad sandwich over this."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I usually nab the kickn Kaylynn. I love the spice with my chicken salad and buttery croissant. There are a lot of choices to fit each palate from sweet, savory, fruit, nuts, etc. If you are looking for a different kind of sandwich then try this place out."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Chicken Salad Chick and I am a fan!! I had the scoop on a croissant with the grape salad. Customer service was excellent! I will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"I first had Chicken Salad Chick when I lived in Auburn! I was so excited when I was walking through OverStreet Mall and stumbled across Chicken Salad Chick in Charlotte NC!! The food is great and it was exactly as I remembered it in Auburn. The classic chicken salad sandwich with Carol's chicken on a croissant with tomato and lettuce is hands down the best thing on the menu. I also highly recommend the broccoli salad. The only thing that I dislike about this location is the lack of customer service. I am so used to the little 2 person building in the parking lot of WinDixie with great customer service and girls who were so excited to be part of the start of something great!   The quality of food has definitely not changed though! I am so thrilled to see this small business flourishing throughout the South!"}
{"text":"I am addicted. The service is great, and the food is even greater. Fruity Fran is my best fran, and I am always recommending to my coworkers at Howl. My favorite side is the broccoli salad, perfectly blended! My only critique is very small - I just wish they had salad options to add the chicken salad as a topper. Overall, this location is an excellent addition to the lunch options at the BOA building, and I am on my way back today! #ChickenSaladChick"}
{"text":"I make a seriously god chicken salad so was hesitant to go here. It was heavily staffed with yellow shirted people and, being brand new, very clean and well appointed.  The problem is, and I have written this before in other reviews, if your name says what you do (serve) then that thing better be GOOOOOD! The chicken salad I got was okay. Nothing more, nothing less. In fact, it had a consistency of unwarmed chicken dip. I felt like ti would have been better microwaved in a bowl and served with chips.The bread was sourdough but toasting was mentioned as an option. The pickle was outstanding and the fresh cookie hit the spot afterwards, but the chicken salad, meh. I do not feel the need to go back. I am glad that folks like it and that it's another interesting adoption in the uptown area."}
{"text":"I think I have ordered from here at least 5 times (as our office of 4 people love it there) and my order has been wrong. Every. Single. Time. My side either isn't there, it's not the BLT version I ordered, today I get toasted wheat bread when I said not toasted and white bread. You have to go back for a refund or for them to fix it so, today is my last visit. The sandwich is good when it's right but wildly frustrating to continuously get orders incorrect. I hate writing bad reviews but..."}
{"text":"I've been here many times & have enjoyed the food.  Today I decided to branch out & get the Cajun roast beef.  Unfortunately, there was nothing Cajun about it.  I had to add salt & pepper after I scraped off the excessive mayo.  I will stick to my regular \"Classic Carol\" next time!  Can't go wrong w/that!  Sides are generously portioned & quite tasty!"}
{"text":"I ended up here by 100% total accident, after going into Fresh Marker (next door) looking for something for lunch and killing time for a MD appt. It musta been meant to be! The name is catchy, which I always love. #1 it is clean from the front door back (always IMPORTANT in my eateries) they had a 97.5 which in my book is GOOD.  The girl taking orders was pleasant, friendly and didn't mind my asking questions and pointing to things I had no clue over (food stored in a side refrigerator with funny names). I got a Chicken salad sandwich on sourdough bread, with the green & red grapes fruit side that had some wonderfully tasty 'sauce' on top of the grapes that tasted like a yogurt/cream cheese combo with nutty topping on that!  A pickle and a choc-o-chip cookie comes with the lunch. It made 2 meals for me (gastric bypass survivor). Total came to about $9. (no drink, I had one). My chicken salad was the spicy Kay Lynn (they all have cute names). It had enough 'kick' and still tasted like chicken salad. I would have like some 'crunch' to it, like diced celery, but ...it didn't matter nor change my opinion. I cannot wait to return for some other salad...I saw one with cranberries/almonds in it...Cranberry Kelli that will be next. I may just go back and buy a pound of chicken salad and make my own this Super Bowl weekend!  I guess that means that I will go back and I would suggest you go too...often! Note to Chicken Salad Chick: you need a Food Truck...as in Uptown, daily with the others! You'd make a ton of cash!"}
{"text":"The employees are all so friendly here! Knowledgable and friendly as they take your order and helpful in the dining room.   The chicken salad and pimento cheese is SO good. Love the new chicken salad with cucumbers and dill in it. The broccoli salad is really good. Pasta said is good but nothing special.   Love this place and will frequent often for lunch I'm sure."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice since they opened 3 days ago.  The first time I got the Fancy Nancy on wheat bread with the side salad.  The chicken salad was excellent but the bread was a little dry but still very delicious.  I was a bit disappointed in the side salad because it was basically a spinach salad which I think should be called out.  The menu said it has crunchy toppings but didn't spell out it was topped with bacon which I don't eat.  The cookie was a nice surprise.  The 2nd time I had a scoop of the Fancy Nancy.  To save on calories I think I prefer this over the sandwich.  I will continue to eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I am so picky about my chicken salad. This place NAILS it!! It is so good and they have so many options! I can't wait to try more chicken salads! I will be back for sure!!! The only reason its not 5 stars is because the service could improve. But even the service wasn't terrible...it just wasn't outstanding! Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Sandwiches are very important to me, so after work or on lunch breaks I like to come by here and indulge. Tons of diff chicken salads - fruity, spicy, savory, you name it, all go great on toasted bread. Pimento cheese they have is also extremely great. One time I had gone they were out of jalapenos so three of the chicken salads I wanted and the pimento cheese were unable to be ordered but the guys in the back were super accommodating to try to make me happy even though I had no problem ordering a different chicken salad, as there are plenty of options to satisfy. Always busy at lunch time to, which is great to see. Great place."}
{"text":"If you like a small kick you have to try the Kay Lynne.  It's. So good!   Prices are comparable to other sandwich places.  And the staff is always really nice.  I always order ahead and take mine to go.  And although the booths are usually free people know this place is good because there's a line at the register...but it moves quickly.    They have soup daily.  Kinda takes the back burner to their concentrated dish of course.  Kind of tastes like it's out of the can.  But as I mentioned I come for their chicken salad not the soup."}
{"text":"Gone way down hill, for 8 dollars you get half a scoop of chicken salad now? Was a fan for years, not anymore.."}
{"text":"Lots of choices for a lunch during work!  Chicken salad on a sandwich, bread or just as a scoop. It also comes with one or two sides (a few dollars difference) plus a pickle and cookie. Nice touch to come with those extras compared to other locations in Overstreet Mall.   The food itself is good quality for the price. I typically get the one scoop and one side meal and come in just under $10. Not a bad price for uptown lunch. They also have a nice dining room that looks to be rather large in the back and let's in a fair amount of sunlight.   The location is very central just next to the Starbucks. They also do a good job of line control with TSA style ropes to keep everyone lined up.  All in all not a bad place. I will definitely be a continued customer!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 salad plate. Cranberry chicken salad had very little taste.  grape chicken salad was also tasteless and the darn grapes were left whole so it wasn't easy to eat.  The fruit salad was not fresh. The grapes were mushy."}
{"text":"Yeah better than fancy chicken salad place in Charlotte area. I got nutty nannas style pretty good"}
{"text":"I saw this place reviewed in the Observer and have now been there twice for take out.  I think the triple sampler is a great deal under $9.  You can get any combination of three chicken salads and sides.  So far, I have tried the Carol's classic, the buffalo, and the Kay Lynne chicken salads.  I love all three of these, but I think the Kay Lynne is my favorite.  It has great flavor without being too hot.  I have also tried the the Pimento Cheese which was good and the Grape Salad which is sweet enough to be a dessert.  They offer chicken salad samples in small cups like an ice cream shop to help you decide what you want.  One pound containers of the most popular flavors are in a refrigerator by the counter where you place your order.  Once you place your order, the food is ready within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Just made my first visit.  BEYOND EXCELLENT both Food and service.  I had the jalapeño scoop with the broccoli salad and loved both. Prices about average for lunch around here,  Mine was $10.68 including drink.  I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"It took me a while to finally try Chicken Salad Chick because Chicken Salad isn't something I typically gravitate towards. But I decided to give them a try one day.I love that their menu tells you every single thing that comes in each Chicken Salad and there is a wide variety to choose from. I'm not a fan of nuts & fruit in any of my food so I stick to the Classics. This includes the Classic Carol, Dixie Chick and Olivia's Old South (My Fav). But I also enjoyed Barbie-Q surprisingly. They also let you try a sample to help you decide. I always get mine with a crossant with lettuce, but they have crackers as well. As for sides, I love the Broccoli Salad and their soups are always delicious! The staff is always very nice and helpful. Really no complaints, I love this place now."}
{"text":"Got to try this place out during a banking holiday so the lunch rush that I usually expect from the overstreet mall was a slow crawl (great for me) but it also gave me time to look at the menu and also get a ton of help from the very nice cashier manning her register.  I just went with the original chick sandwich- you choose the kind of chicken salad... There are a ton of choices... Whether or not you want lettuce and tomato and the type of bread.  Got my drink and sat down... The sandwich was out right away.  I was pleasantly surprised by the cookie and pickle included.  For my side, I went with fruit and its a generous cup of grapes, blueberries, and strawberries which was a refreshing way to end my meal.  The dining space is very nice (brand new!) with a comforting light green wall color.  I like the contrast of the white, black, and red motif they have going on.  The restaurants story is super interesting but it's good how they ended up in this space in uptown.  The employees came by to check on me and offered to take my tray away.  The dining room is keep very clean and orderly.  Super simple, clean approach that I could appreciate.  I guess the true test will be handling the real lunch crowd that can get a bit out of hand sometimes if you don't hit the mall at the right time.  Oh! Almost forgot: the dining room looks out to a plaza behind the BoA plaza which is nice considering that most overstreet mall restaurants have no windows whatsoever."}
{"text":"This place is so good  I had chicken oregano Florentine soup  Yummy .  There's lot of verity salads  I'm gonna keep come over & try all this verity salads"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. I got the \"carol\" on a croissant. The chicken salad was very plain and flavorless. The best part of the meal was the croissant.   The soup of the day was broccoli cheddar which was not good at all. It tasted old.   The establishment is decorated nicely, very modern chic and very clean!"}
{"text":"OK.  I admit it.  I am addicted to Chicken Salad Chick.  All the evidence you need is yesterday when I had it for lunch and then stopped by just before they closed for a pound each of Olivia's Old South and Jazzy Julie to take home for dinner.  This next part is going to sound funny given the paragraph above but, I'll try to explain.  This is not the best chicken salad I've ever had and, I can make a much better version at home.  Here's why, despite this, I'm addicted:    1.  I love variety in most things in life but particularly when it comes to food and CSC has 15 different versions.  2.  I went to their nutrition page after my first visit convinced I would find out I just ate 1000 calories of mayonnaise laden lunch.  NOT the case at all.  In fact, I can get two scoops of chicken salad and fresh fruit on the side for just under 400 calories.  That is way under my normal, OMG I didn't eat breakfast and am so hungry by 11:30 that I go grab some big calorie sub sandwich, Uptown lunch and, I still find it very satisfying.  So why not 5 stars?  They gotta get the \"fresh\" back in the fresh fruit side item.  It's too hit or miss, particularly the strawberries which are oftentimes mushy."}
