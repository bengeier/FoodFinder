{"text":"I happened to be driving down Sahara when I saw a \"ramen\" sign. In this shopping center.  I wasn't that hungry, but I had to try this new restaurant. The hostess/server was very nice and polite, which always is important.  The menu has a lot of choices for a ramen restaurant and they serve Yakisoba as well.  I tried the kimchee miso ramen, where they stir fry the kimchee and chashu together before adding to the ramen. I really liked the flavor, but I will need to try my favorite staple, shoyu ramen in the future  When I try the shoyu ramen next time I will be able to compare and contrast this place with others around town.  The noodles didn't seem harder than other ramen places, and I like the noodles better at Monta.   However, this place is not crowded, roomy, and much closer to my home.  I will come back here for sure!  The gyoza was fresh and apparently it is made daily.. As well as the Kim Chee.   I hope others find and try this place as it is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great little gem! Clean, friendly and quick service. The broth they use for this ramen is excellent! We also ordered the chicken fried rice and shrimp tempura. The tarter sauce for the shrimp was really good."}
{"text":"The food is yummy and big portions. I've only ever ordered delivery here, and the only bad experience I had was with their delivery service they hired. But May fixed the problem when it happened and the ramen was delicious. I ordered from them one other time and there were no issues after the one time."}
{"text":"I tried out this new ramen place as it was closer to my place that my usual spot. It was an alright experience at best, it did the job of filling me up. To start, the broth was weak and tasted watered down, I had to add hot sauce and spices to give it at least a hint of flavor. The noodles were too chewy for me and the chashu pork was not tender at all and lacked flavor. Lastly, the egg was straight hard boiled and and the yolk was dry. On the bright side however the chicken katsu was good. The only thing that would bring me back here is if I'm feeling too lazy again to drive to Jinya."}
{"text":"This place has impressive portions for a very reasonable price! I ordered their house ramen and their curry chicken rice. To say the least, there was way more food than I could finish! The chicken was very tender and juicy, and was paired perfectly with rice and house seasoned cucumbers. The broth was savory, but wasn't too salty. Overall, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"New player in the Vegas ramen wars! Unfortunately, not up to par. Prices are pretty fair though, about $10/bowl with generously-sized apps and sides.   Noodles are chewy and on the thicker side, but there's more to ramen than noodles.  Broth was weak and watered down. The egg was straight-up hard boiled, it even had a gray ring around the yolk; unacceptable. If you can't do it well, don't do it at all. Bowl featured a mix of meats, none of which had much flavor- house made meat ball was bland and unremarkable.   Mochiko chicken was closer in execution to karaage chicken but a little greasy and bland.  DIY a quick sauce using the soy, sriracha, and togarashi at the table.   Mediocre meal leaves me disinclined to make a future visit. Menu also offers a variety of rice dishes and bowls. Service was polite, space has not changed decor since previous ownership."}
{"text":"A hidden gem and Our new favorite ramen spot. Everything fresh and service is amazing. Tried the chefs special,  fried shrimp and gyoza. All of it was delish."}
{"text":"I hope others like me will support this wonderful new restaurant. The food was as fresh as it gets, the place is immaculate and the service was top notch, warm and friendly. We had the home made gyoza, which was disarmingly delicious, as was the sauce. All too often, gyoza, pot stickers and the like are straight out of the freezer in all too many restaurants, These were superb, flavorful and absolutely fresh (made daily) as can be. We had the seafood fried udon. We were surprised at how wonderfully vibrant the flavors were.... superb flavors. We finished it off with mochi ice cream, which is vanilla ice cream in a solid sticky rice powder. It was like an ice cream cookie and it was the first time I ever ate ice cream with a fork. The owners are certainly doing it the right way. I will always support family owned restaurants that care deeply about the quality of the food they are serving over any chain. A delightful experience and we will be back... often..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. This place just opened up about a month ago and I think they are still fine tuning things. There is plenty of seating inside. Maybe the largest interior space of any ramen place I've seen in Las Vegas. But does that translate into good food? Just looking at the menu, they seem to have some interesting things. Not just ramen. There are some good appetizers, and Asian entrees as well, such as Katsu Curry rice.  Speakng of which, I tried their Chicken Katsu Ramen. Interesting. It came out very flat tasting. But next to you, there is a selection of condiments you can add such as Hot Oil to control your spiciness level to your liking, salt so you can make it taste like MSG as much as you want, and even Sriracha sauce. So I think the flatness was intentional because everyone has different tolerances and you can suit your own liking.  The chicken katsu was fine. Nothing so awesome. But my whole meal was $8.65 so I can't complain. I will be back to try other items such as their Mochiko Chicken, of which I heard the next table go ape-shit over, and of course, I have to try their curry."}
{"text":"I've been a customer 5 times in one month. This is my absolute favorite place for Japanese style food (minus the Sushi of course).  They offer large portions for a reasonable price.  Cliff C mentioned that they are still fine tuning things ... maybe he should try again. I think they have it down.  I've been to many Ramen and noodle places and I think that they offer the best value for that area of town."}
{"text":"If sora ramen was a 10. This place would be a 5.5 or close to being a 6.   Gyoza is definitely home made. The ramen is more a Osaka style ramen  It's not bland. But lacks flavor. Almost like its missing something like garlic or maybe ground pork. Something to give it that punch."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Good bang for your buck. Ran out of positive clichés. Great portions. The chashu fried rice is among the best I've had. Plenty of meat and great flavor"}
{"text":"My husband happened to notice the new ramen spot. Tried it out and it was decent. I definitely have other restaurants id rather go for ramen, but the sides were exceptionally good! I had the chashu ramen and it was ok. Chashu was over done. The egg was waaayyyy over. The egg yolk edge was even green. The noodles were actually nice. Broth nothing too great, but can be doctored with the condiments. Tempura shrimp A+ so good! Fresh. Kashu chicken A. Pretty basic, but well done. Gyoza A+++++ Best gyoza I've had! Yummm   I will go back for their entrees and apps. I'll go somewhere else for ramen"}
{"text":"I always been driving past this place from time to time so I had to try it because I love ramen. I ordered the Kimchi Miso Ramen...OMG! It was the best ramen ever!!! I didn't need to add anything to the broth. It was so good and melt in my mouth. I ate the whole bow and it was a big portion. It cost about $10 but it is worth it. Every penny. The service was great and server was nice. Overall, would I recommend this place to everyone?! Hell yes! Go here!!!! NOW! ....At this minute!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite ramen restaurant now. I was craving ramen on a gloomy day so I called this place for delivery and they were able to get a driver out to me even though I was not within their delivery zone. Because I was so thankful I was very generous to the delivery guy.   The ramen was very delicious. I ordered the kimchi miso ramen and the yakisoba noodle. Being a strict vegetarian in Las Vegas it's rare to find a restaurant that serves ramen where the kitchen will accommodate for a custom order of a non-meat based soup if it's not on the menu. Also their portions are huge and the price is unbeatable.   I'm so glad I found this place will definitely recommend this place to all my friends and the next time I'm craving ramen will be dining here."}
{"text":"We walk in on a Sunday around 3:00. We're the only people inside and the owners are sitting at the table with what I assume are their kids. Usually, I'd be skeptical. However the kids were well behaved and the service was great. She was on top of our drinks and dishes, and even offered good alternatives to sauces that they did not have.  Personally, the food was perfect. I ordered the Chef's Special Ramen. The home-made meat balls and fish cake were amazing. The flavors were all there. Threw in a little Sriracha for spice and it was perfect.   Fiancé had the Chicken Katsu Ramen. Just as great. Friends had the Chicken Katsu Curry Rice. They said the curry was \"okay\", but the Katsu itself was amazing. Nothing critical, it wasn't bad...they'd just had better curry around Vegas (we're a little spoiled food-wise).   Overall, great experience. Portions are pretty large, which was pleasantly surprising. Enough to take home and have later. They were all very kind and the atmosphere is very warm and insanely clean. The menu is pretty simple, which is a pretty good sign in my opinion. The food was absolutely delicious. Crunchy bean sprouts, tender meats, flavorful broth, and decent curry.   Loved it. Plan to make this my go-to ramen place."}
{"text":"My parents and I ordered the Chef's special ramen, curry ramen, and miso ramen.   Out of the 3, I like the curry ramen the best. It was the most flavorful and had the best spices in the soup. The noodle to soup ratio was perfect, but I wish there was more substance - whether it be more vegetables or more meat. Something about the meal felt missing. Aside from that, the service was quick and we got our food within 10 minutes. The prices are decent, about $8 and up per bowl.   Personally, there are better ramen places in town like Monta Ramen or Ramen Sora that have a more milky, unique tasting broth."}
{"text":"After living in Japan for four years, I can say this is pretty authentic. The tempura ramen and miso ramen were great-missing a little something that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but really good. The ambiance is spot on; casual and comforting. We also had the gyoza which was nice and crisp and flavorful. As close to the real experience of eating hot ramen in northern Japan as you could get in Vegas, I'd say."}
{"text":"KEY WORDS: PORTIONS AND BROTH!!   This place serves the largest Ramen portions in town! This is a big deal for me because whenever I order a bowl of ramen, I can never get full. This place knows how to serve it and serve it big.   Most Ramen places serve very salty and dense broth. It will either be tasteless or make me feel like having a heart attack after. This is not the case here. I don't understand how they can make the broth so light and savory at the same time. You can literally taste the years of experience from the chef.   The other speciality of this place are the rice dishes. It's  a nice change seeing a Ramen place serve great rice bowls and tasty fried rice. This is a big plus since some of my family doesn't like Ramen.   This restaurant is owned and operated by a lovely wife and husband with two kids. Not only can you enjoy Ramen, but every time you eat here, you're supporting a family's dream.   You haven't tried Ramen until you've eaten at Homi-Yo!!"}
{"text":"I came into this ramen place because it say 4 star on yelp my Husband order a house special ramen he took one bite of the pork and it was bad the pork was old and green it look like the pork been left out too long we give back the order and she end up charging us for the ramen that my husband only took one bite and give it back to her... they never offer to make us a new one or anything.....me and my husband eat out alot  this I must say is the worst restaurant we come across..let this be a warning to everyone even thinking about eating at this place save your money don't do it...........they are alot of ramen place out there and this is the worst of them all don't go repeat do not go!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here everyday just about... I love the gyoza, they hand make them fresh every day, and i cant get enough of the katsu, the mochiko chicken and their fried rice... The ramen is also very good, ive had a few different kinds, the chashu, tempura shrimp, and chicken katsu ramen are my favorites"}
{"text":"I can't imagine anyone ever being disappointed from ordering here. This is ramen people! It's not suppose to be a life changing experience! It's suppose to bring back nostalgic memories of eating ramen from a bag. The only difference now is that you're enjoying this for all the wonderful qualities of not having to cook and serve yourself. Anything fried here is exceptional and the portions!! If you finish a full entree, I dare you to pig out on any apps. This meal will hit any spot and keep you happy as returning customers!"}
{"text":"Tried the House Ramen, and mochiko chicken for a side and was very tasty to say the least. Good flavor overall even if it's more on the bland side. I wouldn't want to compare to other Ramen places in town, but for a place that's brand new and still working out their kinks on the menu, (it's a good menu) it should only get better."}
{"text":"I will start out by saying you definitely get more than enough food. The portions are large. The menu items are reasonably priced and I was pleased with the quality and taste of the food.  We tried the Chicken Katsu Ramen, Miso Ramen, Sea Food Yakisoba, and Veggie Yakisoba. Everything was excellent. The service was great and the restaurant appeared to be very clean. I definitely recommend that you stop in and try this place. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not what you expect. It's a Chinese owned ramen shop so you have none of the Japanese flavors and while it looks like ramen it's really more like Sze Chuan style food using ramen ingredients.  Even the slices of pork tastes different.  Not authentic and I'd go with Monta, Sora, or Jinya for great Japanese ramen in Vegas."}
{"text":"the best ramen I had in years!  there soup taste just like the one I had in japan! I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Very very delicious. Never had a real Raman place but so happy this was my first. The service was the best the waitress was the sweetest and very happy to answer any questions. I got shrimp tempera and it was served on the side so it was still crunchy and so good with the salt based soup. Very clean inside and very beautiful atmosphere. Going back for sure."}
{"text":"This place deserves more customers. The Chicken Katsu ramen was absolutely delicious, and the broth was flavorful. Plus, the portions are big and worth the price. And the best part was the food came pretty fast."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Ramen stock had no flavor at all--watery. We had the miso ramen, but I guess they forgot to add the miso!? Cha Shu tasted like medicine..not freshly made. I've been to every ramen place in Vegas, and many in Japan for years, this is not ramen. Save your money and buy top ramen at Smiths for a quarter. We told the waitress the ramen was watery and her reply was that we didn't know what we were talking about. Would have complained in Japanese, but she wouldn't have understood, she was Chinese. ??? So maybe this is the Chinese version of ramen, whatever it was it was terrible!"}
{"text":"We saw this place at Yelp as hot and new, so we tried it! The portion is huge, the ramen is very tasty and I really enjoyed my food. Restaurant is clean ... I'll definitely come back here to try other ramen..."}
{"text":"I went here on a weekday evening craving some Ramen and wanted to try things out in my  area.  When we walked in this place was pretty dead, I'm guessing because this place is kinda new and in a hidden spot.   I really liked how small and simple their menu is- so that you aren't sitting there for 10 minutes figuring out what you want.   I ended up getting the Wakame Ramen which has Wakame Seaweed, Bean Sprouts, and corn. Just a heads up this doesn't come with any meat- which the server did inform me. When I took my first bite I felt a little disappointed because the broth was a little bland. But the textures of everything together with the nicely cooked ramen was a perfect combo.   I will be back here again though because the server was really sweet and I really want to see these mom and pop shops succeed. I wish them the best of luck in the future."}
