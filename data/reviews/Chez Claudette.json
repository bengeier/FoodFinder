{"text":"Ok place to go at 2 or 3am but the poutine isn't so tasty.  My companion also claimed that the fries aren't crispy enough. The sauce was mediocre as well.  But if you're looking for late night eats in the neighbourhood, it's an option."}
{"text":"Great price great food. Staff was friendly. Place is a little small and dingy, but solid food. Fresh curds and good gravy. Expansive list of various poutines. Very good."}
{"text":"I think they're open 24hr on the weekends, which is only the real selling point for this place. Loads of different types of poutine, but it's a bit disgusting."}
{"text":"Patates rissolées froides et molles, omelette pas très bonne, café qui goûte l'eau, restaurant sale... Bon service par contre. Leur spécialité doit plus être la poutine mais je ne l'ai pas essayée et je risque de ne jamais y retourner."}
{"text":"First time I went to Chez Claudettes I had the amazing New Yorker. The gravy had a bit of spice to it, and was delicious. My second visit, THEY FORGOT MY GRAVY. I am at a lost as to how they could forget gravy on a poutine. Since it was a to-go order, there was nothing I could do to fix it after arriving home."}
{"text":"Well... I would maybe have been inclined to give Chez Claudette a higher rating if it hadn't been for the following....

ordered a poutine classique to go, and then because it was pouring rain decided to eat it inside by the front door.  Even though the place wasn't busy, our french quebec waitress told us that \"next time we order it to go, we have to eat it outside\".

the sauce also kind of tasted like thick canned poutine sauce.  

it was still a delicious poutine and we ate the whole thing.

Our small poutine was around $7.  the same price as any other poutine spot."}

{"text":"J'ai été acheter deux hot-dog Michigan roti pour apporter et voilà que j'arrive chez moi et j'avais deux hot-dog dans un plat d'aluminium avec de la sauce versé partout et des saucisses cru (pas cuits du tout) mais il faisait froid alors je n' ai pas retourné  - je ne vais plus là! Je donne une étoile car je ne peux pas soumettre avec zéro étoiles!"}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall spot was a pleasant surprise to stumble upon! The decor leaves much to be desired and the neighborhood doesn't scream tourism, but if you keep this in mind you're bound to be impressed by this massive poutine menu, authentically French-Canadian ambiance, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Perfect for a late night meal! The staff is friendly and the price is right! I've been known to frequent the place on late nights, i prefer it over the Banquise even if i'm across the street from it.. Its probably due to the huge line up the food is ok but the staff is half and half (i assume they are annoyed of the young drunks) Anyways all to say its my new spot for a late night meal they have a variety of food and even a terrace in the summer."}
{"text":"Great late night greasy spoon.  Burgers, dogs, poutine - perfect fare to top off a night of binge drinking..."}
{"text":"We walked in and sat in the back. This older gentleman was our server...he straight up sucked. He kept walking away when we werent done speaking..so calling across the resto that we wanted ketchup with our fries that he just so quickly tossed on our table n walked away. Didnt come ask us if everything was okay. The food was yummy the prices are great. I just wont be going back in the day time to avoid someone serveing me like i offended him for having my lunch there."}
{"text":"When the line up at Banquise is too long, this is honestly the next best thing in my opinion. They are open late, they have good and efficient service and they offer a bunch of poutine toping options. The poutine is solid in my books. I've recently gone from being a traditionalist, to really liking the one with peas! Who would have known!?"}
{"text":"This was the poutine king during past visits, and I was happy for them to be noted as the most authentic in a New Yorker article about poutine after my first visit years ago. But it seems to have gone south. This time, the fries were greasier and soggy. The gravy had a nice flavor, but it was just lukewarm, and the cheese curds remained cold clumps between the not so great fries and lukewarm gravy. I like the size of the place and its vibe, and the servings are generous, but this visit was disappointing. As others here have pointed out, maybe my issue was that I was sober - but I've had better here before."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice now.  Second trip was deliberately to eat the same thing again, to see if the first time was a fluke or not.  

Had the poutine with hot dogs trio, both times.

The Good:  Excellent fries, properly *fine* minced onion on the hot dogs, best poutine sauce I've ever tasted, decent portion size.

The Meh:  Sauce and fries too cold to melt the cheese even a bit (both times);  very lackadaisical, unalert waitress (both times).

The Bad:  (1) Hot and cold running cell phone assholes piling up at the counter for take-out, all yakking up independent one-way storms while their fries got blanched.   Both times. I mean, shut the fuck up, will ya?  I'm tryin' to read Photo Police here! And (2) THE RESTROOMS SMELLED  LIKE ASS!!  Okay, that's maybe a bit understated.  They smelled like actual sewage.

Both times.

Verdict:  It might be a pattern."}
{"text":"Secretly, the best place for Poutine. Recommended by my coworker, a local in the area, Claudette's poutine was a delicious experience. Sometimes poutine feels really flat and boring after the first 5 bites, but I enjoyed every bite of my  poutine at Claudette, which is kind of amazingly unusual. 

Yes. 5/5 Stars Bam. Would Poutine Again."}
{"text":"Le temple de la Poutine....le tout servi dans un cadre typique et chaleureux....loin très loin des prises de tête! 
C'est un petit restau simple ou tout le monde est le bienvenu!! 
Il y a même une petite terrasse à l'arrière où profiter de quelques rayons de soleil....mais j'attire votre attention sur les difficultés à manger une Poutine en plein soleil....et vous retrouver dans cet état la....!!!!
L'accueil est convivial et familial! Le choix de Poutine est conséquent et offre un tas de combinaison possible! Peut importe celle que vous choisirez, vous serez conquis par leur merveilleuses frites maison dorées à souhait et par une garniture fraîche et goûteuse! 
Vous pourrez également choisir entre la petite et la grande portion....attention la grande est vraiment faites pour les énormes appétits!!!
Point final mais non moins important....les prix sont très corrects et vous pourrez manger une Poutine nuit et jour....dans cette petite place!"}
{"text":"You can get vegetarian pogo (corndogs) poutine here. I feel like that statement should pretty much sum up my review.

But no, I'll keep it going.

Service was friendly, two of the guys in our group are regulars here. We sat on the patio and the wind knocked a beer over. DIDN'T MATTER. WE WERE EATING CORN DOG POUTINE.

I don't like peppers or mushrooms so I picked a lot of the veggies out of my poutine, but I didn't mind, because.. corn dogs."}
{"text":"Chez Claudette is your typical Quebec diner. For breakfast, substitute egg and bacon by ham and beans. For lunch, try a delicious poutine with a homemade gravy or steamed hot-dogs (all dressed: sauerkraut, pickles et mustard). 

This places does it right in the details. For their hotdogs, the pickles are fresh and sweet. For their poutine, the fries are crispy, their curds are fresh (not refrigirated), and the gravy is made from scratch and not from a powder mix (it's a creamy textured beef gravy, with an obvious pepper seasoning). It is very good. 

In terms of the restaurant, its narrow L-shape ensures that you're having an intimate conservation with your friends and neighborhors. You choose if you like that or not :)

edit: It seems like this place has gone downhill. I seem to be the only one who's reviewed Claudette and experienced warm fries... and I swear, it was a sober poutine experience when i went, and it was a good one!"}
{"text":"Hands down the tastiest poutine and all-dressed steamie in the city. I love it.

POUTINE

Finally, a poutine with fresh tasting fries that are not dry and a gravy that is not only gentle on salt but quite tasty as well. I like mushy fries with minimal crisp with a melting potato sweet and fresh oil taste - Claudette's fries are a perfect reference! The gravy really stood out with a blend of garlic and peppery flavours with a controlled salt level so you can taste everything else. I ordered an American poutine which added sautéd mushroom, bell peppers, and \"New York\" steak. I really liked the sautéd mushroom which added a nice texture and a bit of stir-fry burnt to the poutine. The steak didn't add much value but it was big and not saltier than the other stuff so blended in well.

Overall, being easy on the salt AND showcasing great flavours is an achievement. You might be suspicious at first of the endless choice of poutines à la Banquise, but what I took today proved that fancier can be done right.


STEAMIE (hot dog)

The all-dressed steamie at Claudette proved that you could improve such a basic thing as a hot dog by adding more relish than mustard and mince-chopped garlic coleslaw instead of the more thick-cut intertwined choux (Green Spot style). The result is a surprisingly tasty dish that doesn't saturate your taste buds with pure mustard and that is easy to eat - it's the least messy hot dog I've eaten.

I used to be settled on the \"traditional\" Montreal all-dressed steamie, i.e. only mustard, chopped onion (large cubed) and choux. Having toured big names like Décarie Hot Dog, Green Spot, R Lafleur, La Belle Province, and Alfa, some of which deviate from the traditional style, proved that different wasn't better than traditional so I vouched for the latter. The all-dressed steamie at Chez Claudette though is a large enough improvement that I think is innovative and  worthy of parting from traditions.


I LOVE IT BECAUSE

None come close in terms of taste. Tbh I never expected a steamie-the most basic of commodities-could be much different from what I was used to, and didn't expect that a dressed-up poutine can be humble enough to be more than a random pilling up of ingredients.

Chez Claudette also serves all-day breakfast, Boréale bottles of beer @ $5, is open 24H several days a week, and has a small outdoor terrasse. Takes debit and credit.

5 stars and hope it stays true for years to come."}
{"text":"After hearing about my coworkers trying the poutine here, I just had to go and try it the next day. I got there and they have a lot of options for poutine. Took me a long time to decide which one to take but I finally settled on the pharaon. I received the poutine and first thing I liked was that the cheese was melted. Too often with poutine they dump the cheese and it doesn't even melt. Another thing I really liked with this one was the peppers.  The added  a little spicy taste but not overwhelming. 

Overall a good poutine.  Now I'll have to go back to try the other flavors."}
{"text":"Had a great poutine here. I had the mexican and tried some of my friend's original and they were both amazing. Would for sure visit again"}
{"text":"Hungry for lunch! We were just walking on the Laurier street; the first restaurant that we spot was Chez Claudette. When we entered, it was a tiny diner. I won't say it is the most cleanest place. We took a table by the entrance. 

The service was superb. Our waitress was sweet, friendly and very quick. 

The menu has lot varieties of breakfast and comfort food. 

I decided to take a risk, so I ordered chicken tandoori poutine. I won't lie about it...it was really good. Fries, curd cheese, chicken tandoori, caramelized onion, and tandoori sauce made this dish really special. My friend decided to take a breakfast plate with omelette, with potatoes and bread. 

The kitchen was nearby, so the noise of the clanking of dishes were very loud and disrupting. 
But we did stay there about two hours... just talking. I really enjoyed that nice diner."}
{"text":"Got the large poutine. It was delicious! Great cheese, lots of sauce and tasty fries!
I recommend it!!"}
{"text":"What to say about Claudette's -- it's open late, well that's it. Oh yeah some people love this place (young and usually drunk) and some people don't (sober). I've been there twice and the food was not bad for 3am. The poutine is big, the fries were good but the sauce was cold, cold poutine sauce??? That may just shutdown a place, the two diners on St Denis and Mont-Royal can give you a poutine in minutes with piping hot, tasty sauce which melts the cheese. Don't know if I will be back for more in 2012...??? Dun dun duhhh!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Famous spot, been on tv, great poutine (lots of variety, great flavours, etc...)friendly service, great prices and generous portion sizes

Cons: Not in my city!

My friend and I took a trip to Montreal for the day, and naturally we wanted to enjoy some of the traditional Quebec treats. She wanted smoked meat, I wanted poutine...I won! Luckily for her, the food was so tasty so it kind of counts as a win for both of us.

Upon first glance, you might get the wrong impression about this place. It's not super fancy or spacious, and one might think of it as a bit of a dive. Let me tell you, do NOT judge this book by its cover.

The service, while a little slow (its worth the wait, I promise) is super friendly. The menu offers a huge selection of poutine options so, literally, there's something for everyone! Not to mention, for 2 poutines and a burger (plus tip) lunch for my friend and I came out to less than $25. And the portions were huge. Seriously- get the small!

I ordered the \"cabane\" poutine. Take your traditional poutine with cheese curds and amazingly seasoned gravy...then add, maple syrup, baked beans, bacon, ham, and sausage. Yup... I will be working that off all week at the gym, but I have zero regrets.

Once you factor in the \"cool\" factor of checking out another place on the \"you gotta eat here\" list (I'm assuming I'm not the only one that watches the food network and then missions to try as many places as possible...can I?) there really aren't many reasons to avoid checking this place out.

If you're still on the fence, give it a shot. Worst case scenario you fall in love with their food and live in a different province. Like me."}
{"text":"Nothing special about it. I dont know how it got on \"You gotta eat here\". It's nothing different from La Banquise. If anything I think it might be worst, I just dont understand how it got on a FoodNetwork show. I was expecting so much because it was on the show that is why I am being so harsh. I didnt like the sauce and the service was horrible. Waitress did not even acknowledge our existence. Would not recommend and would not go back"}
{"text":"The poutine and burgers are simply delicious here. Burger cochon with bacon and cheese was juicy and full of flavours. We got a trio burger deal that comes with basic poutine -- gravy and cheese -- which I think is the best way to do it. Fries are seasoned nicely also. Most people do take outs but there is plenty of table space inside."}
{"text":"Chez Claudette! Le nom me fait rire! (il me semble que c'est ouvert 24h/24). Et c'est plutôt sympa comme place à 5h du matin après plusieurs litres de bières... (une fois n'est pas coutume!)
J'ai faim, donc j' opte pour un trio cochon qui comprend un burger avec bacon, une poutine et une liqueur. Le tout pour une dizaine de dollars! C'est vraiment cheap!! Le service est correct. 
Place très appréciée pour une fringale tardive!"}
{"text":"Lorsque j'ai dit à mes amis que je n'avais pas encore mangé de poutine à Montréal ( la veille de mon retour pour la France) ils ont insisté pour m'emmener dans leur QG à Poutine. Chez Claudette , le temps s'est arrêté ... la déco digne d'un snack bar des années 60. J'avoue que vu de l'extérieur ça ne paye pas de mine. L'accueil est authentique et simple. La carte des poutines est interminable et le choix est difficile. J'opte pour une pertite poutine fermière ( que je n'ai pas réussi à terminer) J'ai mangé mon premier pogo chez Claudette et ça je m'en souviendrai. Coté prix rien à dire c'est vraiment bon marché !  Merci Claudette"}
{"text":"This is probably more of the authentic Quebec diner experience. I've only ever gone in after a few beers, which certainly enhances the flavor (hit up Dieu du Ciel first). The menu is unpretentious and the poutine is exactly what it should be."}
{"text":"Best value brunch in Montreal. Period. Great place for poutine as well. Classic greasy spoon diner joint that everyone has grown on."}
{"text":"Chez Claudette. What can I say? Montreal would practically not exist without it. I mean this literally. See, a couple years ago a terrible earthquake struck this gorgeous city, splitting it head from toe. Strangely enough, the fault lines ran perfectly through each poutine shop in Montreal, gem of Quebec. The only shop standing? Chez Claudette. Give them a big round of applause, please."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Probably 4 stars if you're drunk late at night. Funny how that improves just about any restaurant. If you're a tourist looking to try a classic Quebec poutine you should look elsewhere for the magical experience."}
{"text":"Menu with cheap / low quality food; essentially charging you for stuff you can buy pre-made at a grocery store. Got food poising within 3 hours of eating the pogo and poutine here. Something about their French fries also tasted off--so who knows if they are just using spoiled produce. Little English spoken and the guy pretty much forced us to tip after he just stopped attending to us after we got our food. 
Not impressed."}
{"text":"Kinda famous? But kinda gross?

Let me tell you...I just about fell out of my chair when I found out my office was right near a poutine place that appeared on the TV show \"You Gotta Eat Here\". I thought that this place would be a show stopper considering it's located in the poutine capital of the world! Right?! WRONG. On both of my visits, I've been utterly disappointed. 
First I tried the Italian poutine. This is my favorite type of poutine. It usually has a finely ground Italian spaghetti style sauce covering salty crispy fries with cheese curds. Well what I was served was not that at all. Chunky chunk chunky sauce big fat unbroken pieces of ground beef, canned tomatoes & quarter onion slices. All of the veggies were grossly under cooked. It had zero flavor and zero salt. Needless to say I ate a few bites reluctantly paid, and left.
I went in a second and final time thinking they may just have a godawful Italian poutine but given it's ample selection to choose from, I'll try something else. I got a regular poutine because who can screw that up, along with a burger and a drink. This time it was worse... the burger patties are frozen store bought and tasted like old cardboard, the fries were again flavourless and unsalted and the gravy was a cold, snotty, tasteless mess. 

The only thing I'll give them \"kudos\" for is the pricing & service. If you want a cheap cheap tasteless poutine and friendly-ish waitresses, this is a good spot in the Plateau area. 

None the less, I recommend passing on this one. I have no idea how they get so many good reviews so I sincerely hope Im wrong and got them on a bad day (or two). 
If you aren't from here and want a cheap and fast poutine experience, go to Lafleur before coming here."}
{"text":"I ordered a plain poutine, heard a lot of good things about this place. I didn't like the gravy. The cheese is good and so are the fries. Maybe order a different type in the future."}
{"text":"Very very good!!! Hugh portions if you are hungry! Lots of verities for gravy, veggie is really delicious! Good prices!"}
{"text":"Poutine ce soir Chez Claudette !
J'aurais bien 3.5 si j'avais pu. Les poutines sont bonnes et la serveuse vraiment sympathique. Par contre niveau quantité je trouve que la grande n'est pas si grande que ça et du coup je trouve le prix un peu cher par rapport à d'autres places. Cela explique le 3.5 et non le 4 ;-)
J'aime bien le cadre car on est vraiment dans l'atmosphère d'un restaurant québecois avec les photos des Canadiens et les diverses références locales.
Ce n'est pas ma référence mais clairement pas non plus la pire poutine que j'ai faite :)"}
{"text":"I like better than la banquist but they use the same potatoes and cheese...just different gravy."}
{"text":"The tandoori poutine was the best poutine I've ever had. Every detail to the dish was perfect! The service is not great, it was during lunchtime and I understand being busy but they weren't swamped the problem was that everyone just seemed to be walking around confused. Except one guy. Thankfully he took over our table. Ignore the uncovered, hot buckets full of gravy sitting around for some reason and go there with patience on your side and the outcome will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Un grand choix de poutines, jusqu'ici toutes excellentes !"}
{"text":"The only thing of value that came of the money I spent here was this review and the fact that my stomach stopped growling. 

Took a large onion and mushroom Poutine. Mushrooms undercooked, onions undercooked but others charred, low flavor sauce. Belle province Poutine is 10x better than this. Service was non existant even though we sat two feet from the cash. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Chez Claudette n'est pas un endroit où je vais pour le déjeuner, le lunch, ou le souper. Par contre, il y a quelques soirées durant l'année ou je suis très reconnaissante d'avoir ce petit restaurant à quelques pas de chez moi. Surtout lors de ces soirées un peu trop arrosées, lorsque la fringale de minuit me frappe et que rien ne pourra me satisfaire sauf une poutine.

Amis touristes, c'est ici que l'on retrouve les meilleures poutines en ville. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Definitely a big fan of this place. You can't replicate the taste of the poutine anywhere else, and the portion sizes are huge. I typically don't order poutine with extra ingredients, but there was a lot of variety on the menu so I went for it.

The service was great, and our food was brought out around 10-15 minutes after we ordered. It wasn't extremely pricey either, which was nice. 

I'd 100% recommend this place for lunch or supper if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Poutine was alright but don't try the red wine. It tasted like vinegar. It seems to be a local favourite and it was featured on \"you gotta eat here.\" I have to disagree with John Catucci on this one."}
{"text":"Hands down the best poutine in Montreal. 

For those who don't know exactly what poutine is: it's everything wrong in the world put together to make something so right!

I love going to Claudette, I used to live right next to it and went almost every day; thank God for my fast metabolism! I even painted the yellow facade and green terrasse.

It's half trendy joint, half authentic family restaurant, with the wooden menu that has typos in it, staff that might get a bit too personal and greasy delicious food.

Try the \"Poutine bâton\", it's poutine with Pogo slices in it and it's insane! You can really feel the years of your life leaving your body as you're eating it!"}
{"text":"Une des meilleures poutines de Montréal. Leur brunch est aussi vraiment bon. Très bon rapport qualité prix. Des repas végétariens sont proposés. Je recommande !"}
{"text":"Local dive for late night poutine. Just around the corner of my house it is a super easy option for us. I LIKE my late night poutine so I am super picky. I think that Chez Claudette is fine but by far from my favorite joint for late night poutine. I would say it is a good option late without a long wait. I tried the \"Baton\" poutine with a cut up pogo and it was ok. My favorite is the traditional and the mushroom and pepper poutine. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Our offices have been relocated to this area so what a great opportunity to try this place. 
Diner style, greasy spoony type of restaurant, this place is open early and closes late enough. It doesn't even close all weekend. 
Where chez Claudette apparently really shines is with their choices of poutines. My colleagues and I went there for lunch and I had the smoked meat poutine. Let's just say that I should have had the American poutine with steak, mushrooms and peppers that my colleague ordered. The fries were homemade and crunchy on the outside and perfect on the inside, the gravy was ok and the cheese were melted enough but the smoked meat fell short. I'd say it was \"meh!\". 
Breakfast options are great and reasonably priced. You can get some eggs and sausages or bacon for around 5$. 
Overall, don't expect the fanciest meal but it's definitely good enough for the price."}
{"text":"P-e un petit réajustement de note ici. Pour moi c'est un 3 et demi. Une bonne raison pourquoi c'Est plus proche du 4 que tu 2-3 c'est 
1) Ouvert 24h
2) C'est un snackbar bâtard, lâchez-moi les C'était hmmokk C'est ça que c'est de la bouffe de snack bar! Ils ont le mérite d'avoir des frites maison et d'avoir une poutine très honnête

Paumé? La paye est vraiment loin? Rejoigné les punks bohème hipster sur la terasse pour un roteux, une poutine ou un bon burget honnête beau-bon-pas cher!"}
{"text":"Was famished after a sweet concert at the Fairmount Theatre; spotted this corner eatery on my way to the Laurier metro station. Honestly, I was too tired to have examined the menu in depth so all I can say is it has all the classic casse croute items you could want. 

Settled for a hotdog and poutine combo for $7 (that is two hotdogs and a small poutine). It filled the hole but was not enjoyable. Heck, if I am going to sacrifice minutes of my life to a heap of gravy and fries it should at least be enjoyable! For what's open late at night, and for cheap, it will have to do."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant sympa mais sans plus. J'y ai gouté le burger végétarien qui était correct mais pas exceptionnel ni particulièrement copieux. 
Il y a également un grand choix de poutines dont une végétarienne mais aucune végétalienne donc pas l'endroit où aller si on est végétalien ou intolérant au lactose. 
L'ambiance et la déco ne sont pas non plus particulièrement chaleureuses ni accueillante. Personnellement, je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Nice 24hr joint for the weekend 3am munchies. I was however disappointed with the veggie poutine as it was incredibly bland. I Would give this place another chance tho."}
{"text":"This place is a bit of an institution and I usually come here when I have a poutine craving. The poutine here and at the Banquise are quite similar and both are excellent, but my preference for Chez Claudette is due to shorter lineups and they accept credit cards. I think Banquise might have a bit more selection in the type of poutines but Chez Claudette has quite a variety in selection so there is bound to be something for everybody's taste."}
{"text":"Quite surprised to find a lot of upset reviews about Chez Claudette, my neighbourhood greasy spoon. Although I can`t comment on what dining there is like because I always grab my poutine to go, I can tell you that this is one of the hardest working restaurants in Montreal. Not only are they open 24 hours over the weekend, but they're also open on stat holidays. Makes me suspect that the owner is Chinese, though the menu is 100% québecois. Their classic poutine is consistently good. Those fries really stand out - noticeably sweet the way I like it - which balance well with the salty gravy. Their guédille au poulet also deserves a mention and accompanies the poutine well if you need a little protein punch to your meal. The only `meh` factor is that one of their waitresses always has this sour look on her face. She`d say bonjour to me, but coldly, and unfortunately she's always there whenever I have a poutine craving. Hope she retires soon."}
{"text":"Defenatly a huge fan of this place. A very welcoming dinner style place that makes youbfeel at home and the bonus cool VEGETERIAN options (burger, hot d9g sandwich, poutine and ofcourse saldes). This is a place every one can find some to eat( meat lovers to vegans) and the price ranges from thats very reasonable to cool this is cheap.
I've been here over the weekend and the place was both packed and understaffed which effected my expirience (therefore not a solid 5). Great neighborhood resturant that has years of reputation with a great menu. Add this to your \"beer night/ game night/ late night manch:)"}
{"text":"Been here twice and won't be back anytime soon.

On the first time, I ordered their braised pork poutine, which is essentially crockpot pork in a pepper gravy. The cubes of pork were tough, dry, and tasteless (it didnt even taste like pork). The accompanying gravy was kind of spicy due to the black peppers. The fries were the typical french quebecois fries - deep fried but still somewhat mushy, and not crispy. 

Second time around, I decided to give their original gravy a go, so I ordered the classic poutine...it was not exceptional in flavor despite what some claim. 

What I can conclude is that they're really greedy on the cheese curds. Both times I went, I've been given small quantities of cheese on my poutines such that I started with a poutine and was left with half a 'frite sauce', and I don't even like cheese (wait waaaat how can you -- I'm not a baby cow).

Their steamie, on the other hand, is very balanced in taste, for a Montreal-style steamie (ie: not a sauerkraut dog). 

Service was probably the worst I've experienced at a casse croute. Cashier kept a straight face all along (not a single smile or thanks), and cooks looked fed up with their job. 

Price/quantity wise, it's more expensive than Decarie Hot Dog, but cheaper than Orange Julep."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. The brunch combo come with eggs, toast, potatoes, beans, a generous amount of crispy bacon, coffee and a choice of crepes or french toast. Very affordable proces, good quality, and good service. I highly recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"Chez Claudette definitively doesn't need my review because it's famous!
This is a perfect go to place to eat Poutine. They have so much choice of Poutine it's always so hard to choose. The staff is really nice and rapid. I love this place."}
{"text":"Forget about all the poutines you've had. This place is by far has the most delicious late night eat in Plateau.

The fries are not very greasy like some other places, the cheese/fries ratios are high and the prices are great! 

I'd highly recommend their breakfast/brunch, too, if you don't want to wait for half an hour in the line at the \"hip\" places. The dishes are as tasty."}
{"text":"Not a fancy place but the poutines are very good. I ordered a Vol-au-vent poutine and it was amazing."}
{"text":"One of the Montreal classic Poutine joints up there with patati patata and la banquise. 

Great fries, great cheese (and lots of it!). Personally, the gravy leaves a bit to be desired, but it may just be a personal preference! Definitely worth checking off your Montréal bucket list.

If you are genuinely hoping to get a Poutine fix, this may very well be a go-to for you as the lineup is not an issue, and service is quick in comparison to other \"celeb status\" poutines.
