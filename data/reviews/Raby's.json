{"text":"PICTURE OF ITEM DOES NOT MATCH WHAT IS FOR SALE!
I ordered the chicken sandwich based on the paper menu,that I got from their sister restaurant. On my way there I had my heart set on the large grilled chicken breast that was busting out of a round sesame seed bun. I eagerly pointed to the sandwich on the in-store menu (which is also on the giant menu board above the cash) - which is exactly the same as the paper version. I was asked by my waiter, \"lemon, medium or hot\". I took medium. When my sandwich arrive on a plate with NOTHING ELSE, but just a lonely sandwich, what I got was nothing that resembled the picture!

Totally different bun and significantly smaller, flat piece of chicken. The bun was larger than the chicken. I asked the waiter after my meal, \"Can I make a suggestion?\" He said \"sure\", I asked, \"why was my sandwich NOT like the picture?\" 

He told me that picture on the menu is actually not on the menu -- despite having a price for the chicken sandwich next to it. Furthermore, if I wanted that item, they do have a special product called \"a chicken BURGER\" (as opposed to chicken sandwich) which is on their specials menu and it resembles the photo. 

NO SIDES SERVED WITH ORDER
Aside from that, it does not come with fries. Just the deflated sandwich alone.

My sister bought a donaire --spelled Doner --  (a Turkish version of a shawarma), same thing, nothing came with it, no salad, no fries, nothing. She also bought a roasted chicken leg and again, nothing came with it. 

TASTE
The taste was nothing worth remembering. The chicken burger bun tasted like it had too much yeast.

The roasted chicken leg was not very flavorful.

The donaire was a prepacked item that was slapped on a grill and re-fried as it would seem. A donaire is supposed to be cooked exactly like a shawarma, that is on a vertically standing rotisserie."}

{"text":"A hidden gem in Thorncliffe Park!  Newly opened and renovated.  From the outside, you can still tell of the old Coffee Style with the neon 'Pizza' lights and lighted ticker outlining their specials to customers outside.  

When you enter though, you'll notice that there have been significant renos done to make this place more comfortable and upscale looking.  The booths look like they have been reupholstered.  Like the modern lights over each table and the chandeliers overhanging parts of the restaurant.

Upon entering the fast food joint type glass doors, you will find a blast of Thai decor of  pink orchids in water in tall cylindrical vases.  Nice touch.  

In front of you then you will see the daily specials written on a sandwich board and a take out counter and behind that the kitchen.  

We were greeted warmly and asked if we were eating in or take out.  We stayed to eat dinner.

There were only 1 other party in the place on a Sunday at 6pm.  I was surprised there was not more customers (mostly families with young children) at that time but realized that more came in around 7:30.

We were given our menus and a pitcher of water and glasses promptly.  May I add that the glassware was spotlessly clean and no grease as with some establishments.

With the various cuisines that they offer, I only tried the Indian and thai.  

Order:

Raby's Chicken wings - deep fried wings with a sweet glaze, cilantro and hot peppers - amazing!

Tandoori fish - comes piping hot on a still smoking skillet with a slice of lemon and onions - I recommend this highly

Butter chicken - a bit of a peppery twist from the usual Indian Butter Chickens I've tasted - the sauce is perfect to sop up with the best naan bread I've ever eaten.  

Our server was fantastic.  Came by twice to see how we were enjoying everything.

Decent prices - I hope it doesn't go up after everyone discovers it.      

I am thoroughly impressed by the food, service and atmosphere.  Just wish more people knew about it."}
{"text":"Came across Raby's in an effort of finding some new restaurants within driving distance of Don Mills. 
At first, when looking at any menu that has Lebanese, Indian, Thai, Mexican, and Pizza all on the same menu I would be sceptical as it is the opposite of when you can expect good things from a place that has a small but well executed menu. But it was lunch time, and we had people to feed with varying interests so we decided to give it a go.

The building itself is an old Coffee Style location but they actually did a good job renovating the place. 
The outside signage is all new and clean. The walls have decorative rock walls, the tables and booths were all pretty nice. Its kind of like they realized the area they were in and realizing that even making the place look marginally nice will make it upscale compared to the local competition. There is a counter area in the one side of the restaurant to order from and then you go have a seat on the other side and they bring the food out to you. The staff were pretty friendly overall and the bathrooms were clean so in the competition of strip mall and fast food places in the neighbourhood, you can't hold this place back for its setup.

Myself and a couple others settled on a daily special that was not on the menu where we got a big plate of a whole lot of options including some chicken tikki masala, butter lentils, some kind of vegetarian red colored sauce thing, a piece of tandoori chicken, a big pile of rice, a piece of naan, and a single gulab jamon ball for dessert. With a Vinto soda, this all only came to $9.59 after tax!!! Once the food came out (which took about 15 minutes), we began to chow down and I gotta say, not one thing was disappointing. It was all actually pretty darn good, and for the size of the plate of food in front of me, couldn't believe it was under $10. The flavours and seasonings all were well executed, and even the naan was fantastic. The only down side was that the tikki masala and curry based dishes weren't the hottest in temperature, and by the time finishing off the plate were reaching a lukewarm state.
Two other dining companions ordered the chicken shawarma, 1 on a rice and salad plate and 1 in a wrap. The salad/rice shawarma came out with a healthy portion of fresh grilled chicken over a good size plate of rice and salad with a side of hummus, it looked quite good and got 2 thumbs up from its eater. The wrapped shawarma also and he was super impressed, to the point of saying one of the best shawarmas that he's ever had. The one thing that this place seems to have going for it is that it cooks the chicken fresh on order and is really moist and not too dry, but at the same time don't expect it in your hands 3 minutes after ordering like some places.

One surprising thing was how empty the place is. It was 12-1pm lunch time on a Friday, and I only saw one other table and two take out order individuals come in while we were there. Hopefully this place drums up some business as Raby's can certainly count on my return in the near future, and I'd hate to see this place have to close up shop leaving us with one less decent lunch place in the area."}
{"text":"I really like this place in terms of quality for the price.  I had the chili chicken and it was really good.  All breast meat pieces and a nice balance of spices.  It's a great place to go for people that don't want to commit to a specific cuisine.  Very reasonable prices.  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The service is so slow it's like watching someone in slow motion their attitude seem like they could care less if you ever came back. As for the food it's just ok so go somewhere else. You will be sure to get better service (anything is better than them) and the food will be better too!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food but not everything on the menu tastes good. Avoid the Thai curry."}
