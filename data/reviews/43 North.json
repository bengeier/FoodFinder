{"text":"Went for lunch today. Lobster bisque was outstanding, as usual, but the steamed buns were terrible. Could not tell the duck from the beef short ribs, because each tasted like a salt lick. Only reason for 3 stars is the bisque and previous dinners. Hopefully it was one bad day."}
{"text":"Clever menu offers half portions of most entrees.  Makes it easy to satisfy the very hungry and not-so hungry diner.  Loved the baccala croquettes. Solid prep and excellent service.

Returned a few days later for a Monday wine tasting menu.  Outstanding! Knowledgeable wine expert (thanks Dave Lund of Prestige Wines) and again, great food served family style.  Wonderful bargain--4 courses and 4 paired wines for $40.

403 North has been trying for years to find its niche in downtown Madison. My most recent visits give me hope that it finally has!"}
{"text":"Went here on a date night.  They had a fantastic deal for 30% off during happy hour if before 7.  I hope this continues, as if I could I would go here several times a month for dinner.  Great meal.  small and large plates.  We had the chicken wings which were ok, nothing fancy, but had their dukk bok ki, which was very good, their beet salad which was solid.  Can't remember what else i had.

Overall very good meal.  we had 5-6 dishes and the total was $50'ish with the 30% off discount.  good service.  nice atmosphere.  

Many of their dishes have a little asian fusion in it, which I didn't realize at first but now I realize that 43 North is a Muramoto-based restaurant.

I hope it does well, and hope to get back there once a month if available.  You can't go wrong with the dishes here, adn their menu is pretty varied so you should be able to find something you like.  Give it a try if you're in Madison!"}
{"text":"I lucked out again with a restaurant and found that I went during hour hours.  Everything on the menu (including alcohol) was 30% off!  This place has a good selection of wine and has enough selection of beer on tap or bottles for the non-wine drinkers.
I started off with a small blood orange salad and lobster bisque.  The salad had good acidity and was not overly dressed.  The bisque was creamy with sweetness from the tarragon marshmallow and saltiness from the small chunks of lobster meat.  
For my entree, I ordered the game hen dish.  The mustard caramel that filled the hen plate was too sweet for my taste, but I'm sure it is something others may like.  Due to the sweet sauce, I was not able to finish off the gnocchi and shitake mushrooms that accompanied the dish.  The gnocchi was a little on the dry side as well.
With the great happy hour prices and good ambiance, I would definitely come back to try the other dishes.  Just make sure to go Monday through Thursday from 5pm-7pm or Friday through Saturday from 5pm-6pm."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to restaurants when I can't decide where to go. I've had brunch here and it was good but not exceptional. They sometimes dabble a bit on molecular gastronomy which is always fun and keeps things fresh and light. My favorite dish here is their Game Hen with mustard caramel. I also enjoy most of their desserts, they change constantly but are always good or at least interesting/innovative flavor combinations."}
{"text":"I dined here during winter restaurant week.  Overall, I was a bit disappointed, and that's at a great price.  The interior of the restaurant is nice, very sleek.  My primary issue was with the service.  The restaurant was not that crowded, but I definitely felt like we were being rushed.  We were in and out in less than an hour for a three-course meal.  That's fine if you're looking for a quick bite to eat, but this was supposed to be a multi-course dining experience.  I'm not sure if this is typical, or if it was a restaurant week thing.  The waitress was nice enough.

However, I thought my food was pretty tasty.  The bread was pretty standard, but came with three kinds of butter, which was nice.  I started with the lobster bisque, which was very rich and had big chunks of lobster meat and these awesome tarragon marshmallows.  I had the loup de mer for my entree.  It was also good - not amazing, but simply prepared and fresh-tasting.  I enjoyed the dessert, which was a rich fudge-like chocolate with apricot-paprika sauce.  The suggested wine did pair very nicely with the entree.  My husband thought his selections were decent.  He really liked the chicken thigh first course and the dessert, but didn't really enjoy the beef cheek.   

Overall, I'm hesitant to return.  I know I would be paying much more than $25, which is fine, but I'm not sure if the experience will be better."}
{"text":"I had the best salad of my life here--the caesar salad. Yum. Loved this restaurant!"}
{"text":"They have small and large plate for every dish, so that's convenient for trying out different things."}
{"text":"Summary: Fantastic food! It was a life changing experience! Good atmosphere, great bar selection, and great service. 

My husband and I stopped in for a quick dinner before a show. The tables were full, but bar was open and they offered full service. 

The food: 
Wow, I cannot say enough good things about the food. We started with the beef carpaccio, and then I had a grilled salmon and my husband had roasted game hen. 

The carpaccio was like buttah! The cut of beef was buttery and lean and pounded to a very smooth and thin consistency. It was served with shaved fried onions and parmesan crackers and garnished with sprouts. I could scoop the beef onto my cracker without needing to cut it, THAT's how tender it was! The beef melted in my mouth and was very enjoyable on the palette!

My salmon was PERFECTION! If you've read my review for Brocach, you'd know that I think it's very hard to find Salmon that is done well. The salmon was seared on the outside which gave it a nice crunch, but was tender, flaky, and moist on the inside. It melted in my mouth! It was served with fennel and a root vegetable puree. The flavors were well balanced and complimented each other wonderfully! 

My husband loved his game hen as well. The meat was tender and flavorful and well plated. His entree was also paired with sweet potato gnocchi. I tried a bit of his meal as well and I fully agree with him! 

As an added touch, the kitchen is an open space. From where we were sitting at the bar, we could see the chef and sous chef in action. As foodies and people who have grown up in the industry, we truly enjoy watching chefs who love what they do. These guys made working the line look effortless! It was like watching a ballet. I'd be tempted to make sure I have a vantage point to watch them again when we go back next, which we absolutely will! 

We decided to pass on dessert as we needed to get to our show. As a nice little bonus, we were given a little slice of coffee cake to take with us. The cake was well composed, balanced, and flavorful. It was a nice little bit of sweetness on the palette to end the night! 

As you can expect for food of this caliber, the cost is a bit more expensive. But, trust me, it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Ate at 43 North for the first time this weekend and loved it!  Not only great service and a nice atmosphere, but outstanding food paired with an excellent wine selection."}
{"text":"I won't return.  The service was quite embarrassing---the waiter requesting that we pass our plates down, pass down our water glasses, et cetera.  The food was alright, but not fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband, myself and another couple went to the Wine Pairing last night. What a great learning experience not to mention the wonderful food that was paired with the wines from the Loire Valley in France! We look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Eaten there twice. first time was great and I couldn't wait to go back. second time was so \"not great\" that we decided to not go back again. Don't know what happened since there was only about a week between out visits, but for the price, I've already found MUCH better."}
{"text":"Went to 43 North for Madison Restaurant Week. Overall underwhelmed. Maybe it was the reduced menu for the week, but our main dishes, were small (especially the salmon) and I still left a little hungry (and I usually eat a normal amount of food for a female). Taste overall was O.K. but I feel like I have had similar items that have tasted better at similar Madison eateries. I may go back again when they are serving the full menu."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner and had a FANTASTIC meal. It was phenomenal and during happy hour. So you really can't beat the price. 

My dinner experience here was so good, I wanted to take my cousin here for lunch since it'll be her last time visiting Madison. 

Lunch here was... horrible. There was one waiter and one chef/cook. There were two other tables, three including mine. We ordered three buns, the lobster bisque, and three entrees. It took about 45 minutes for our buns and bisque to come out. It took about an hour and thirty minutes for our entrees to come out. And I know the exact times because we got there at around one and I was starving. So every minute passing was excruciating. (And our two hour parking ticket told us what time we arrived). The lobster bisque is good. Creamy without it tasting too much like heavy whipping cream. The duck confit bun was just horrible. And I rarely use that word to describe food because I love food. But it really was bad. The duck didn't taste like duck,  it just tasted like fried rock salt. My lips were burning from the saltiness. 

The food here is really good. But don't come during lunch time. Also their house iced tea, which they advertise as their own house blend,  is just Lipton iced tea. Discovering this just soured my lunch experience here."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  The menu looked great, and even the food looked good when it came to the table.  But it really fell short--every single one of our dishes was bland, some what greasy, and cold.  Definitely falls down on execution and wasn't worth the $100 bill for two.  There's definitely better in Madison!"}
{"text":"Everything was soooo good.  We had the grilled caesar salad, Wagyu Steak, baguette with jam, and scallops.  The only thing that was not good was the Cassoulet*"}
{"text":"I made the reservation through open table.  I had been a few times for brunch back when they had it and always wanted to try it for dinner.  I am glad we finally did.  Our waitress was very good.  She knew about everything on the menu when asked to describe some of the dishes.  

To start we had the stuff dates with goat cheese.  They were delicious.  I have had a similiar dish before but with figs.  I liked the figs version better but overall it was a good trade off.

After that my dad got the beef carpaccio.  He said it was good but should have been sliced thinner.  I had the lobster bisque soup.  It was very good and a large portion.  The way they present the soup was very nice.  They pour the soup in front of you so you can see the large piece of lobster in the soup.

We loved that we could order our entrees as small plates since we had 3 starters.  We tried the braised beef and scallops.  Both were very good and had wonderful sauces.  The beef was very tender and not fatty which can happen with braised beef.  The scallops were plump, big, and rich.  I am definitely glad we did this as a small plate because I couldn't imagine eating 4 of those scallops.  

The dessert options were lacking in my opinion.  Nothing really caught my attention but we did try one.  It was a thick, dry cake with banana cream spread.  It was tasty but was my dad's choice.  I would have passed on dessert because of the options.

I will definitely go back to try more of the dishes."}
{"text":"Spent a night in Madison while driving from NYC to Los Angeles. Everything we had was pretty good. Brussels sprout salad was a favorite. Cheese seemed overpriced, but was tasty. Lamb and hen were good. We had small dinner plates, which were enough after sharing a salad and starters. The space itself was loud for being a small restaurant. The staff was super friendly. Overall, nice night out in the Midwest."}
{"text":"Get the beet salad.  Scallops were perfectly done!  Tables are too close together- but that is typical in Madison."}
{"text":"Shinji Muramoto, Lorraine and  Chef Nick have outdone themselves with this new dining spot.  Chef Nick is a James Beard Nominated Chef and was best of the Midwest in 2010. We had dined at his former kitchen,  Restaurant Magnus,  first as meat eaters and were totally blown away.  Then, as vegetarians and again, totally amazed.  Now, we eat no meat or dairy and it's no surprise that now, at 43 North, Chef Nick created the best vegan meal we've ever eaten.  It's clear, whether it's pork, fish or carrots, he loves what he does and should be running his own restaurant.  We'll follow him where ever he goes.  Lastly, Host Lorraine was sweet, accommodating and anything but stuffy.  In fact, she rocked."}
{"text":"Don't get the cocktails! I liked the salmon and the dates. Happy hour deal pulled us in. Food was good but not great. Considering that this place with the happy hour 30% off is much more economical than other places around the square, it's worth it on a budget,"}
{"text":"Great, easy place to go for a romantic dinner.

Went for restaurant week last year; came back this year because they apparently missed the memo about serving the absolute minimum (in other words, they went all out for restaurant week even as other places noticeably skimped)."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try 42 North for my husband's birthday. Upon stepping inside, we were greeted not by aromas of delicious food, but by a musty, stinky stench. It seriously smelled like dirty old carpets. We were seated, and I noticed there was only one other occupied table.....red flag. Our waiter was friendly, but before ordering even a drink, I inquired about the smell. The waiter said he didn't notice anything, but then he'd been sick for over a week and couldn't smell a thing. Couldn't even hear out of his left ear, in fact! He suggested it might be a dirty mop that needed bleaching, since they had just cleaned out their mop closet. Aroma of dirty mop over dinner, I'll pass! We graciously excused ourselves and went elsewhere. Not likely to give this a second chance. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Service left much to be desired. Very inattentive and was less than helpful with questions regarding the menu. The food was good, the roasted dates were nothing short of incredible."}
{"text":"Dates with goat cheese were great as well as the ratatouille     But my scallops were cold.  My wife's duck was average."}
{"text":"This was a nice little discovery for me.  The quality of service and food were wonderful especially for the price.  The ambiance is unpretentious, contemporary but warm.  I had the cornish game hen and it was moist yet crispy on the outside and nicely seasoned.  It came with some vegetables that were undeniably fresh and cooked just right.  Wide selection of wines and cocktails.  The service was earnest and friendly, yet relaxed, I really felt that they cared about their jobs.  Overall, I highly recommend this little gem!"}
{"text":"After eating here twice, a review is in order.  My husband and I went here on a weeknight for our anniversary dinner.  The happy hour is excellent, 30 percent off drinks and food!  The waiter greeted us as soon as we arrived, perfect amount of attention throughout the meal, not overbearing, but genuinely interested.  I got the lobster bisque which I loved!  Very inventive and excellent flavor.  We also got the carpaccio which was sadly forgettable.  We each got a specialty drink, I loved mine, but my husband though his was a bit sweet (pineapple and fruit based drink, kind of expected to be sweet).  For my main course I got the salmon, smaller size portion.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I had asked for it to be rare, and though it was a small size, it was absolutely perfect, crust on the outside, rare inside.  the sauce had a lot of dill and tiny potatoes, very flavorful.  My husband got the cassoulet, hearty with a lot of flavor packed in.  I noticed that as we were served, the people doing the cooking in the kitchen were watching to see what we thought, a definite sign that this restaurant truly cares what people think of their food.  The food here is not typical, they favor presentation and quality over quantity of food, but this is something I find refreshing.  

When I saw they do a four course meal with wine pairings every Monday for $40, I had to go back to try it!  Again, I was completely satisfied with my experience.  The menu was outstanding.  To begin was a goat cheese tart with bacon, super high charged flavor.  The next course was a type of forcemeat obviously house made, highly flavorful and one of my favorite courses of the night.  It was served with some nuts and fruits and crisps, and also the wine for that course.  The next course was the filet mignon, perfectly rare on the inside, crusted on the outside with a savory sauce that set it off.  It was served with a deep complex red wine that complimented it nicely.  I had to stuff myself to finish, but it was worth it!  the final course was an apple pie, but unlike any other apple pie I have ever had before.  It had tart apple, rich caramel, perfectly crisp crust and a creamy semi fredo on the side that fit perfectly.  It was a meal I will never forget and an absolute steal for $40!  We had enough wine from the 4 course pairings that my friend was tipsy upon leaving, though I was fine to drive.  We were probably there an hour and a half to two hours, I am a slow eater.  43 North is most definitely worth checking out.  It is refreshing to see something so unique and special amidst the typical offerings of the area."}
{"text":"We happened to be there early - a 5:30 reservation. We had been at an event in the afternoon and decided on an early dinner out rather than going home and coming back. 

A relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere. And what a pleasant surprise - happy hour on the weekend too!  And it included your entire bill, 30% off before 6pm. We got our order placed and soon enjoyed not only a discounted meal and bottle of wine but also a delicious one. 

The four of us shared the stuffed figs. What an amazing treat. We all opted for small plates and the portion was a perfect, \"normal\" food size.  It also allowed us to enjoy a salad or soup, entre and even dessert. All were amazing.  My grilled romaine salad was nicely done though I didn't care for the crunchy onions on the top.  Others had the soup for the day, a very spicy Bloody Mary soup, the peach salad and cheese platter. All were well received.  

The others all had the scallops and they must have been delicious because no one offered me a bite!  My lamb served on polenta with an olive relish was so good, I never offered them any either!  

Because we hadn't over indulged, dessert was ordered. The panna cotta special was so good we were later searching for a recipe. 

We were visiting Madison. The locals we were with had never been to 43 North either. We will insist on coming again and they were so pleasantly surprised that they are putting it in their regular list of places to eat!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at 43 North prior to a show at the Ovation. It was \"restaurant week\" so the menu was a limited, but awesome! I had the game hen which I highly recommend and my wife had salmon which she thought was terrific too! Portion sizes are appropriate, the setting is quieter than most capital area establishments, the service was impeccable and the food was beautifully presented. Definitely on our list of places to return to!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again last week and... not super impressed. So far I've been here 4 times and it's hit or miss each time... like a 4/4.5 one time and then a 2 the next time, which makes me go back every once and awhile and forgiving the restaurant, then the next time being disappointed.

Both the service and the food are hit or miss, though this last time our drinks were comped due to the incredibly slow service.

In general, I say the food is quite good for the most part and wouldn't NOT tell people to go here, there are just so many better restaurants that a guaranteed greats so close by.

Mostly, I jus miss Cafe Continental."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week Menu: Pork, Salmon, Squash.
Pretty Limited, as is the case for most places, I don't mind fish, but Salmon is so hit-or-miss for me that I rarely eat it. I'd rather just drink, but after a long day of work and the commitment to the group, I decide \"I'll try the pork.\" 

Food: 
Pork - mine was a little pink in the middle and everyone else's was white. I was a little worried as I haven't had pork loin in 20 yrs, but I did not get sick. Flavoring was average, but the accompaniments of pan roasted brusel sprouts with oyster mushrooms in a sort of demi-glace atop mashed cannellini beans were VERY good. Just the right amount of heavy flavors from the veggies to slam against the bland pork. 4.5/5

Salmon (I tried a bite) - NOT fishy, perfectly cooked, great flake. This version is different from the normal menu. My bite had a parsnip with it. It was very tasty, and I could have easily eaten the whole thing. The potatoes were mashed with milk so I don't think I could have eaten those, but they were friendly with making dietary adjustments for me. 4/5

Beet Salad - It was a salad with beets (not beets only like my friends thought it would be). Very light and flavorful with shaved carrots, onions, dark mixed greens, and vinegar dressing. 4/5

Roasted Dates - did not try, but EVERYONE who did get this literally left nothing on the plate. Lots of forks clanking to get the last bit of sauce.

Flan/Panna Cotta - everyone agreed it was good, but only a few actually finished it. Maybe they were too full. It looked amazing to me (but can't do with the milk issues).

Buneleos (donut holes) - these were barely average. I had a small bite for tasting. Just too heavy after the pork meal and tasted like a county fair. Bad choice to go after the pork. Not sure how it would have followed the other entrees. 2/5

Service - Efficient for a party of 9 DURING restaurant week. But the place is pretty small so there wasn't much \"competition\" for us, and we weren't very needy. Not overly attentive, but very good. 4/5

Drinks - we all got wine. They had a selected wine pairing for the food. Plus a wine menu and additional drink menu (with more, different wines). Prices were ok.

Ambiance - Small, intimate, relatively quiet, nothing overwhelming, unless we were just that loud and didn't know it. It was dark, but light enough to see our food (this usually drives me crazy).

Other:
Little detail - they have moved from a previous location. So if you haven't been there in a while, check the location!

Pork is NOT usually on their menu. Not sure why this was chosen for restaurant week, as I thought it was suppose to showcase the restaurant for people new to it. Maybe they'll be changing the menu soon?

Dietary issues - Mine is lactose. They were willing to help me and make adjustments, except on the dessert. Bonus to them.

Other yelpers had trouble with service. Ours was very good, and I'm the only yelper in the group. I think they were just very well prepared for this week. Maybe the tables of two for that night have a different opinion.

Overall:
I liked it. Definitely interested in returning to give the service and some other items a try."}
{"text":"Simply put, an amazing experience. The food is outstanding- especially the lobster bisque and the Cornish game hen. The combination of flavors used, local ingredients and helpful staff are three amazing reasons you should check out 43 North right now.

Also, we heard at the restaurant that the protests really hurt their buisness this winter. Apparently, most protesters wanted a beer and a burger, not the *RIDICULOUSLY GOOD* cuisine 43 North offers. Please don't let this one die- Madison needs a stellar replacement for Cafe Continental (downtown, anyway), and this is it!"}
{"text":"We were wandering through the market on Saturday morning and were looking for a place to have breakfast and hide from the rain. 
The menu on the door looked delicious so we decided to give it a try. The decor, coffee, food and service were amazing!

Our waiter answered all of out questions and made excellent suggestions. We had the Carbonara gnocchi and Crab cake Benedict. Both were beyond spectacular.  When we repeatedly gushed about the excellent coffee, he brought us the bag so that we could find and buy it for home. He even brought us two small pieces of coffee cake to eat with our 3rd cup of coffee. 

This place is spectacular. Unfortunately we don't live in Madison and can't go back today! We will definitely go back to 43 North on our next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"Came here with a company of 6 to enjoy a nice couples dinner. Boy were we disappointed. Service was bad, it took over an hour to get the food and no one really explained why or apologized. Once they main course arrived, everyone around the table was unsatisfied with their food - and we had four different courses amongst us. 

Bad service, bad main course, and food took forever. Only reason I give this place a 2 rather than one is bc the cheese platter appetizer was pretty good. But then again, how do you even screw up a cheese platter even if you try to."}
{"text":"Good food terrible service. Half or table got food and after an hour and a half we have up and left."}
{"text":"Not much I can say - amazing food, great service, awesome that they offer free parking on the same block.  I had dinner there two nights ago and I'm still thinking about how good the food was.  Even my salad was amazing - MY SALAD.  Will absolutely go back.  My advice - don't waste precious stomach space on drinks - save as much room for the food as humanly possible because you will want to eat it all!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant in Madison!  Everything was fantastic, creative and fun!  The bread butter and jam (lavender jelly) was excellent, the salmon tartar perfect, salads fresh and yummy, I had the half order of game hen which was prepared perfectly and easy to eat (and filling, the gravy was very rich but tasty) and my husband has a half order of the steak and it was just great.  Fun drinks, perfect service.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Game hen and lobster bisque are amazing. However, they seem to be out of items on the menu often, but there are always other great options. 

The current chef (and they seem to change frequently) does a lot of interesting, unexpected contrasts. Things you expect to be part of a savory dish show up in dessert, and sweet things accompany savory dishes. Not a bad dish on the menu. 

Interior design is simple, classic contemporary in the downtown area. Overall, a nice atmosphere, but a little on the noisy side because there are few soft furnishings to absorb the sound. 
 
Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week Yumminess!

To start, my mom and I shared the Sweet Potato Soup and Dates. Our favorite was by far the dates, however the soup was yummy too. The combo of the Pesto, Goat Cheese and Dates was out of this world. I just wish the dish would have come with more - 3 dates to share was a little disappointing. Our main dishes we shared were the Curried Cauliflower and Game Hen. Let me say that I had never considered grilling a large piece of Cauliflower before, but I just might now. It was so good. The Game Hen was delicious as well, and perfectly cooked. 

For dessert we had the cheese board, and Panna Cotta. I'd say I enjoyed the Cheese more than the Panna Cotta but both were yummy.

Overall, I will definitely be returning to 43 North. If it was that delicious during Restaurant Week, I expect it to be even better when it's not!"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try 43 North, especially given it's fantastic happy hour special. Overall, I was more excited by their bathroom embellishments then their food. That's not to say their food wasn't good, but I'm a sucker for orchids and over sized mirrors, not to mention a sleek decor tailored for their modern bistro name. 
We got 5 things to share between the two of us (thank goodness for their small plate option!). Out of them, I would get the grilled Caesar salad and dates again. The salad had a great tangy dressing and the poached egg on top was a nice touch. I liked the dates as well and of course like any normal person, pesto on anything makes me happy. The so-sos were the charcuterie plate and Wagyu steak. The steak was tender but not a lot of flavor-or rather any flavor was masked by this loud dill sauce. Covering a good piece of steak with overbearing sauce is one of my biggest pet peeves. Now the worst by far was the duck confit salad. The duck was cold, bland and did not sit well on top of a pretty romaine mix. Skip this. 
I'm tempted to try this place again with all the yelp love it has, but will have to tread carefully!"}
{"text":"We brought about 25 people here for a company dinner during the Epic Systems Forum. Arranged a pris fixe menu in advance with the group coordinator (Fred). The restaurant came through for us in all respects. Great food, great service, excellent wine list with many nice wines available by the glass, and surprisingly inexpensive. 43 North is the latitude of Madison, in case you're wondering."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time a few weeks ago.  Immediately one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Service was fantastic--professional but not over the top.  Everything I ate was well cooked and seasoned and unique.  I found the place to be sophisticated but not pretentious.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We tried the new menu  - the lobster bisque with tarragon marshmellows is just as good as the reviews suggested.  The foiewurst was a very nicely balanced combination of sausage, mustard and pear.  The lamb tongue with frisee, quail egg and potatoes was also tasty.   We enjoyed the halibut with harissa, but my dining companion favored his  poached lobster on buttermilk spaetzel with carrots and pea vines - it had a lovely delicate sweetness.  But the piece de la resistance was the tamarind passionfruit dessert with coconut powder - juicy, creamy with dustings of powdered coconut, it was pure tropical joy.  The wine pairings were also very well done - and quite reasonable.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 with a dinner reservation for 7:30 on a Saturday night.  It seemed fairly slow and that may be due to the time of year and the weather because it certainly doesn't reflect the quality of the food or the restaurant as a whole.

We started with a cheese sampler that was outstanding and reminiscent of those found at the old Cafe Montmartre.  This is an establishment serving small and large plates to encourage sharing family style and that's exactly what we did.  We started with a small plate of the duck and the short-ribs.  Our waiter accidentally placed the order as large but when he realized his mistake, he only charged us for the small.  Both were wonderful with rich flavor and visually appealing.  We finished with the salmon plate.  The salmon was done perfectly and had a sweet maple flavor.  

A small piece of house-made coffee cake was given to each patron with the check and was a very nice touch.

The place filled in around us during our meal but our foursome never felt crowded nor did we have to speak overtly loud to converse.  

Our waiter, Jeremy, was very attentive and overall it was a great experience.  I would recommend 43 North without hesitation."}
{"text":"Let me just say that the food was delicious. But that isn't what this review is going to be about. That's right, I'm going rogue. 

First of all, I'm a nerd for maps and this place has a killer map of the world made out of nails. I'm probably going to copy this idea and do it at my own house when I actually buy one.

The coolest part of all this is that the waiter was willing to talk to us about the place. It is a new place, so that's probably typical, but it's always cool when you can tell that the staff is proud to work at a place. He had been there from the very beginning of the restaurant helping get the place setup. 

The only sad part of all this is that ...

1. I don't live in Madison anymore, so I can't return regularly (ode to 43 North).
2. I miss Cafe Continental. Bad. The potatoes they served with breakfast cannot be topped. Absolutely delicious. 

RIP Cafe Continental Potatoes

p.s. 43 North is the latitude of Madtown. Again, my love of maps..."}
{"text":"A group of six of us visited 43 North recently. It was around 7 pm on a week night. We had reservations but we didn't need them as there were very few patrons.

We weren't quite ready to order when our waiter came by to take our drink order, and he seemed mildly put out by that. He seemed put off the rest of the evening. The drink menu consisted of a variety of wines, beers, and some unique cocktails. The dinner menu was not large, but contained multiple intriguing items that we don't see on many menus. There were also a couple of specials in addition to the regular menu items.

For an appetizer I had the carpaccio. This was a full-size plate of thinly sliced beef with crunchy fried sun-choke chips on top. It was absolutely delicious and felt like a decent portion for the price. Others in our group had the lobster bisque which they said was the best bisque ever, a parsnip soup which also had rave reviews and a salmon tartar which I will also vouch for. Delicious food and beautifully presented.

Entrees can be ordered in either full-size or half portions which is a nice touch. I had the game hen which was served with potato gnocchi and mushrooms. It was perfectly cooked, beautiful to look at, and tasted amazing. The rest of our group had the wagyu steak, halibut, and duck breast. Again everyone in our group was thrilled with their entrees. The taste, the textures, and the presentations were all spot on.

When the check came, each of us received a small slice of coffee cake individually sealed to take with us. This was again, a very classy touch. In that same vein, I have to comment on the men's room. It's highly unusual, but several of us noticed how good the men's room smelled. I don't know if it was proximity to the kitchen or if they pipe something in there, but it smelled like dessert.

The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star review is our waiter. He didn't do anything wrong specifically, it was just his surly attitude. It felt like we were putting him out whenever he came to our table.

We'll definitely go back. The food was some of the best we've had in Madison!"}
{"text":"Went to 43 North because of a friend who had recommended this place to me. I actually work across the street and have never bothered to check it out. My date and I went on a Saturday evening. The place was not very busy. We started off with the goat cheese stuffed dates and those were amazing. The pesto they came with was also good. I had one of their cucumber cocktails and it was so refreshing. The cocktail was also pretty large in size. For entrees we had the wagyu steak half portion and the salmon half portion. The option for half portion was really nice. I would suggest the half portion to anyone having a late night dinner and planning on going out after. You don't leave stuffed ,but you won't leave hungry. I loved my steak and it was cooked medium rare just as I wanted, but I must talk about the salmon. The salmon came in a cucumber dill cream sauce. Oh my goodness. It was soo good. Maybe I just love cucumber that much. I even dipped my steak in that cucumber dill sauce because it was so good. I look forward to coming back, but I may just order the salmon next time!"}
{"text":"My dining companions and I decided to blow out Muramoto Anniversary week in two days - Monday was lunch at Sushi and dinner at Restaurant, then Tuesday was dinner at 43 North. This was my first experience at the newest of the Muramoto empire and, like all things Shinji touches, it was (mostly) pure gold.

We made unnecessary reservations as, at 7 pm, there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant. During the course of our two and a quarter hour meal, only two additional tables were seated - a deuce and a single. Granted, it was a Tuesday night but there's something a bit sad about eating an outstanding meal in a nearly empty restaurant.

I had the Fish Tasting menu ($54 for 5 courses) and chose not to include the $18 wine pairings. My companions ordered a la carte but managed to get four courses in anyway so I only had to eat one course \"alone\". 

The Fish Tasting included the now-famous lobster bisque, a beautiful piece of sock-eye salmon that is supposed to be an appetizer but could have easily been an entree, a rainbow trout dish that was immense, a stravecchio parmesan cheese course, and the raspberry-lemon cake dessert. 

My companions had, between them, the lamb-tongue appetizer, another bisque, the sirloin strip steak, bouillabaisse, and the tamarind-passion fruit dessert. 

Here are my high-level observations:

- The portions are very large for this style of cuisine - especially if you're tackling one of the tasting menus
- The food is a bit fussy - sort of Top Chef \"let's see if we can combine these 10 disparate things and make something awesome\"
- Regardless of the fussiness, the flavor combinations are bold, adventurous, and, more often than not, very successful.

Generally, I turn my nose up at a coulis on every plate or gastronomic acrobatics like a \"tarragon marshmallow\", but as much as I wanted to make fun of the pretentiousness of the place, the food was really wonderful - satisfying and challenging. With almost every dish, the sum of its parts far exceeded the individual bits.

The service was attentive - which it should have been given the \"crowd\" - if (again) a bit fussy. I'm not sure I needed a two minute explanation of each plate. Frankly, if my food needs a two minute explanation, maybe it's too complicated.

I've heard, over and over, that 43 North is exceedingly expensive. This rumor did not bear out for us. We spent significantly more at Restaurant Muramoto at this time last year than we did at 43 North. And, for a true fine-dining experience, the portions are large and (as mentioned) the food is very good. 

Of my plates, my favorites were the lobster bisque (a touch of brandy added an unexpected flavor), the sock-eye salmon (perfectly cooked medium rare with a gorgeous sear and a bed of fresh peas, parsnip, and green onion that stole the show), and the lemon-vanilla cream on the dessert. Yes, I'm picking one element of the dessert but I can't help it. I would have eaten a bowl of the stuff. 

While I doubt that 43 North will be in heavy rotation for me, it will - like Harvest - be one of my go-to places when I want a really, really good meal and a little fuss."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always surprised it's not more crowded. Drinks are delicious and inexpensive. Food is big portions for tapas and really good. I highly recommend the salmon tartar and beef carpaccio. If you have to limit yourself, then do those two dishes and the raine drink.  You won't be disappointed. They currently have 30 percent off (food and drinks) between 5-6 on Tuesday to Saturday. Really can't beat a good deal on good food."}
{"text":"Update to a 5, I have to say I just love this place.  

Noise level is good, service is great, nice drink menu, but the food is just AMAZING.

I have never had anything at this place I don't like.

The dates with cheese and pesto and hazelnuts.... a perfect start.  The curry carrot soup was perfect for the weather and just enough curry.  The beet salad was to-die-for good; amazing flavors of cardamom soil, and goat cheese, wow!  Finally the scallops were cooked to perfection with an amazingly beautiful and tasty pea garnish.

I never hear people suggesting this restaurant around town.   This place would definitely be in my Madison top 10."}
{"text":"I loved 43 North and will definitely return. Atmosphere: sophisticated and refreshingly clean, not \"theme\" heavy like a lot of places in Madison these days. Service: top notch. Course 1: Salmon tartar--just lovely, light and also satisfying. Fresh and delicious. My dinner mate wasn't crazy about the orange powder, but I liked it. Course 2: Beef Carpaccio--a little dry, but good flavor. I probably wouldn't order this particular course again, however. Course 3: Duck Confit Salad: Wow. Just wow. If you like cabbage and duck, this is the dish for you. Rich of the rich, calling it a \"salad\" is a bit of a stretch, this is no bed of greens. I had no idea red cabbage and duck went so well together! It was creative and delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. I have dietary restrictions (no gluten or dairy) and the staff was super knowledgeable. We were seated promptly and served promptly; I was particularly impressed that since we had ordered mussels, as soon as the bowl for shells was filled above the rim, BAM, new bowl. Great selection and lots of food I could eat, plus the chef was knowledgeable and able to modify and accommodate as well.

If you go between 5 and 7, it's 30% off, which was great--30% off EVERYTHING, including bottles of wine, etc.

We split an order of the chilled mussels--divine!--and each had a salad. I'm really not a huge fan of greens usually, but the brussel sprout salad was so good I ate all of it. The deep-fried celeriac was a great touch, and my partner adored her duck salad. 

We each had a small salad and small entree and it was just the right amount of food. She had the lamb, I had the wagyu steak, and both were absolutely phenomenal.

Definitely planning on going there again. If I could have anything, I would've wanted a dessert option that was gluten- AND dairy-free, but I have yet to find a restaurant that offers that beyond sorbet. Oh well. Definitely a big winner and we plan to frequent it."}
{"text":"Very disappointing . Cannot handle a steady flow of small plates so some people receive 5 at once and others still haven't eaten before others are ordering coffee.
Wait staff seems to think it a greet imposition to clear plates. Food presented with no attention to appearance and totally completely under seasoned.
Would not recommend under any circumstance."}
{"text":"Probably the best meal I have ever had in Madison. My husband and I each got one of the featured pairings- one fish one veg. They were both amazing. The lobster bisque lived up to the reviews. The vegetarian main dish was delicious w the wheat berries. 

Not only was the food great but also the service. Our waiter Dale was friendly and very knowledgable. The hostess was accommodating to our walk in reservation. 

Definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"I give 43 North a solid four stars because I was impressed and quite happy with my meal, but there were a few pieces of my experience that I didn't love.

Pros:
- Fantastic food all around. We ate the lobster bisque, salmon tartare, beet salad (Dwight would be proud), wagyu beef, scallops and nougat.
- The wilted kale with the scallop dish was wonderful. I didn't know kale could actually taste that good!
- Presentation of the food was gorgeous. 
- Trendy, cool atmosphere. I like the dark purple booths.
- We received little pre-wrapped cinnamon coffee cake slices with our bill. What a cute idea, and the cake was wonderful!

Cons:
- Our server was prompt and professional but not warm and friendly.
- While I enjoyed the salmon tartar, I was expecting more seasoning on the salmon itself. It was bland yet tasted great with the salty crackers. I understand they should be eaten together, but I personally prefer every piece of the dish be seasoned.
- I would have liked the nougat dessert to have been sweeter. I have a major sweet tooth, though, so maybe this is just me being picky.

I enjoyed my experience at 43 North and would recommend others at least give it a shot."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but nothing to write home about.  I had the foie gras on brown butter biscotti (the foie gras was super salty and the biscotti, super sweet!) to start, and my boyfriend had the lobster bisque, which was VERY fishy (I'm not complaining about that one).  My entree, the corn and barley fritters, was like high-end comfort food but they didn't blow my mind.  My boyfriend had the game hen, which I thought was pretty good but he was a bit meh on.

Service was very attentive (my boyfriend would call it \"intrusive\"), but dude was a bit nervous, you could tell.  He was very sweet though.  Good wine list.  Very generic decor.  I'm not sure if I'll be back.

I'd say B- for food and A for effort."}
{"text":"Good food and service. The roasted dates appetizer was fantastic. They are a little short on vegetarian options, especially for entrees, but I was able to make do."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!   A co-worker suggested this be added to the Sat. Night dining list after a great meal on Valentine's.  So, we made plans for last Saturday night.  Did I say fantastic?   Free parking(validated) in Tenney building, so no concern about trying to find a place to park.  Walked in the back, and found our way to the front.  Seated in a lovely small table in the front.  Able to view the street and watch the restaurant.  Couple a red wines, nice list.  Started with the goat cheese stuffed dates and pesto.  Wow, great start.  Then she had the grilled caesar more for the uniqueness and she wasn't in love with it, it was fine.  I went with the lobster bisque.  Love the presentation of the tarragon marshmallow and cracklin, with the creamy broth poured into the bowl.
Entrees were the waygu steak and game hen. Wow, wow, wow.  Both were served perfectly and just fantastic.  Tender and flavorful.   Our waiter was great.  Just the right amount of contact with us, checking how things were, helping with questions, and then leaving us.    NOTE:  30% off happy hour, when seated before 6pm.  How great is that.  We have to come back.  I need to try most of the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I recently read a review in the Wisconsin State Journal that brought me to 43 North, and I have to agree with the excited tone that the reviewer had.   If you follow my Yelp reviews, you'll know that I consider myself to be quite the savvy diner, so when I found out 43 North had a happy hour running from 5-7, I couldn't stay away.  From drinks to dinner, everything on our bill was 30% off.   They were premiering a new menu a bit different from the one accessible on their website, which seemed to be an improvement.   Most of the dishes have an option of a small or large portion, so if you like to share like we do, it's perfect.

To start, the service was excellent.   We were seated immediately, and our waitress was always pleasant.  We started with the lobster bisque, and they happily split our serving into two portions.  In general, the creamy yumminess that is bisque makes for a great crowd pleaser, but this bisque went a step further by adding whole chunk lobster to the bottom of the bowl, topped with a lobster fritter and surprisingly complimentary marshmallows.  We licked our bowls clean.  

Next we had the beef carpaccio, which was also stellar.  Though the flavor of the beef was a bit masked by the heavy handed olive oil and shaved cheese application, the ingredients were all still incredibly addictive...something I could eat an entire plate of alone.  

Our entrees came out of the kitchen hot, but they were a bit more disappointing.  The game hen was roasted beautifully, but the gnocchi served under the half bird seemed like an afterthought, and had little flavor other than the sweetened sauce that was present over the entire dish.  Hen= crispy and delicious, the rest of the dish= meh, I'm going to save room for dessert.  The scallops with a celeriac puree were also good, but not great.  The scallops weren't properly seared, which is fine with me if the flavors are there...but they missed the mark.  It was impossible to get past the fact that every single bite had sand in it.  I was crunching upon the sea, and wasn't liking it.  The celeriac was delicious, but again, I just couldn't get past the mouth of rocks I got.  I pulled our waitress aside and told her about the issue, and she was very sweet, but I had no idea what I meant when I said there was sand in my food.  \"You mean the texture was off?\"  No, sand, like you find at the beach, is in my food.  \"Oh, I'm sorry....\"  A friend of mine visited the restaurant one day later, got the scallops, and also experienced the issue.  Either our waitress didn't tell the chef, or the issue wasn't properly addressed.

All of that aside, I will be back to try their other small plates.  I'm a sucker for high-end food at a happy hour price, and 43 North has a place in my Monday night (everywhere else I want to go is closed) repertoire."}
{"text":"The food and wine was absolutely phenomenal, but the servings were a little small. If you can make it during happy hour do that (even on Saturday evenings!)"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places within walking distance of me that I hadn't yet been to, so I was ecstatic when my date suggested 43 North for Valentine's day! The atmosphere was totally date-y, though since they moved everything to be two person tables it got a bit cramped. The Valentine's day menu looked good, but we got too excited about the regular menu and ordered off that.

We got:
-the Syrah-Grenache-Mouvedere which was perfect with the rest of the meal!
-the hard goat cheese (literally amazing) and the fenugreek gouda (super interesting and delicious)
-the dates stuffed with goat cheese with pesto and walnuts
-duck confit salad and butternut squash salad. In my opinion, the duck confit blew the rest of the meal out of the water. I also love love love duck confit so I might be biased... But it was DELICIOUS. Salty with the right amount of crunch and sweetness from the cabbage and the walnuts. Whew!
-for main entrees, the wagyu was awesome. Ended up eating my half essentially without realizing it because I was in a fog of deliciousness. Then the lamb cassoulet... If you love white beans, this is the thing for you. And I do! Yum!!

Couldn't even get to dessert because we were too full. (Though they did give us little cakes with our check!) 

Wow. What a meal!! Will 100% be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! This is a little known gem. It's never busy and very good. It's very affordable as well. My hinterland IPA was $10. My duck confit salad was $10 (large size), 2 great scallops with two sauces and veggies was $17.

We had salmon tartare with pickled blueberries, orange spice, and very fresh homemade crackers. For main I ordered scallops (2 for $17, could have done 4 for $32) that came with a cardamon sauce and a celarac (sp?) sauce (celery root based sauce, very understated and fitting) as well as a small portion of vegetables, (sliced portobellos and swiss chard). I also got a nice duck confit and red cabbage that was only $10.

My dad's lamb cassoullet was great. Our dessert was a chocolate orange mouse with other various delicious things but now I'm tired of typing.

Just go there already."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our 1 year anniversary and we had a great time!  The lobster bisque was out of this world tasty, highly recommend it! Great location by the capital and a super cool ambience inside the restaurant. Definitely a great spot for a fancy dinner!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a quiet, romantic dinner here.  The waiter could not have been more professional.  It was a weekday, so it was pretty empty and we had a great time.  The bartender made some special cocktails just for us.  We tasted lots of new dishes by ordering multiple small plates."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Madison and it is the one I return to whenever I have out-of-town visitors. They have two size options for their entrees, meaning i get to enjoy their glorious brussel sprout salad with a small plate without leaving painfully stuffed. Their lobster bisque is delectable, and is an experience to enjoy, as they create a beautiful arrangement of lobster meat and cracklins then pour over the flavorful broth. Beautiful. When you come between 5-7, you get 30% off of your bill (including wine, woohoo!).

The best thing about 43 North, though, are the scallops. They are my very favorite meal in Madison. A small plate of scallops is more than enough for a filling and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"These guys have got it down!  Our waiter was incredible with attentive and prompt service that wasn't overbearing or rushed.  The food was spectacular, the wine recommendation was great.  

Biggest piece of advice: GET DESSERT!"}
{"text":"43 North's special Valentine's Day four-course prix fixe was, hands down, one of the BEST meals I've had in Madison, ever.

Each of the four courses offered three supremely adventurous and deliciously executed choices, imaginatively (de)constructed or served in novel - yet hearty - ways.  Standouts included the lobster bisque, poured at the table over succulent and generous pieces of meaty lobster, a take on fried chicken with spaetzle that was more like a fall-off-the-bone-tender confit, a seared salmon in microgreens with shaved shallot and lemon dressing, _huge_ sea scallops with jamón ibérico over pear and the beef loin over puréed root veg.  Each course offering was served with an unexpected yet exciting twist, and a variety of amuses-bouches were offered throughout the meal - including a starter of a strawberry purée and cava cocktail, and ending with a take-home portion of 43 North's coffee cake (presumably served at their new Sunday brunch).  Desserts were playful deconstructed takes on classics; the concentrated form enhanced flavor and offered a visually stimulating presentation that was matched with the intense flavors (of chocolate-caramel flan, in one case, and panna cotta with mango, in the other).  Cocktails were also splendid, particularly the Hendricks and St. Germain \"Rainie.\"

In addition, the service from \"Birgit\" was excellent - she was attentive, informative and enthusiastic about the special meal and it made dining a pleasure.  The maítre d' was equally warm and welcomed us in as special guests for the evening - it's a feeling that makes this restaurant just a cut above other high-end options in town.

For $50 per person, this was one of the most reasonably priced yet fantastic dining experiences I've ever had.  I can't rave enough.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Its ok.  Its not a value but the food is decent for the price.  The one part of our experience that stands out is the bartender.  He pours cocktails the way they were meant to be poured: not fancy and very strong.

The lobster bisque, as one other reviewer has mentioned, was 'fishy' to me.  It was also way too sweet for my tastes.  The meal itself was ok.  The bill was a bit steep for Madison but probably not out of the ordinary for larger cities.  Service was fine. 

The space is small and the bar is kind of uncomfortable.  Its almost like its there as an afterthought and we felt like the staff was surprised we wanted to have a drink there. 

They could use some music to improve the ambiance.  Its a little boring.  

Overall its ok.  Nothing really draws me back to it but I can see how others may like it."}
{"text":"True, I do have a policy where I don't eat at restaurants that put pictures of their food on the windows (which they do) but last night I made an exception and took a friend there during the 30% off happy hour than runs from 5-7.  One can only conclude that the 30% off special (which is a good bargain) was introduced to try to help combat \"empty restaurant syndrome\".  While we arrived pretty early (5:30) and it was a Monday, I was surprised that we were the only ones in the restaurant.  This didn't change until around 6:15 when another table was seated.  
The inside of the restaurant is sleek with a modern decor.  The open kitchen was immaculate and the staff welcoming.  The food is offered in small plates (designed for sharing) or large plates.  We chose the small plate route and ordered three items:
Goat Stuffed Dates
Goat \"DDuk bok gi\"
Duck Breast 
Our favorite was the goat \"dduck\".  This hot and spicy rice cake dish was excellently prepared and the spiciness complemented the richness of the goat.  The rice cakes themselves were also very good.
The other two small plates really didn't hit the mark.  While not \"bad\", they weren't something I would try again.
The sweetness of the dates completely overpowered the goat meat stuffing.  They were almost cloyingly sweet and needed an acid to help balance it out.  
The duck breast was very ho-hum.  The meat was prepared nicely, sliced in small medallions over a puree of sweet potatoes.  This would have been fine but a \"foam\" of Crispin cider did absolutely nothing for the dish.  Looking more like spittle than foam, it seemed out of place and awkward.  Why take what I would call a \"humble dish\" (it also was accompanied with root vegetables) and try to spiff it up with foam?
As my date and I discussed this more, I realized that the confusion around this dish carries over to the theme of the entire menu and restaurant.  What truly is 43 North?  It calls itself a modern bistro but neither the food nor the decor embraces \"bistro\".  Looking at the menu, is it Mediterranean?  Asian? New American?  I think this confusion is causing diners to not flock here.  No doubt, there is skill in the kitchen and the meals it puts out.  But without an identity, people don't know what to expect and tend to go elsewhere.  I hope things change.  If not, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for Winter Restaurant Week and was very pleased!  We had a wonderful and helpful server, who was the perfect combination of attentive and knowledgeable without being overbearing.  We had plenty of time to linger over and luxuriate our meal, which was well-presented and delicious!  Their lobster bisque in particular stood out as memorable for both myself and my dining partner: rich, creamy, silky, with a generous portion of lobster meat, as well as two garnishes (a lobster cracklin and tarragon marshmallow) which, while slightly frouffy, were outstanding additions to the flavor and texture of the bisque.  Our second courses (braised beef cheek and hazelnut cannelloni) and desserts were both wonderfully prepared and tasty.
I appreciated everything about our experience at this restaurant, particularly its intimacy and the ability to see the kitchen.  Although it is a wee bit too pricey and pretentious for me to make it a regular spot, I really think it is worth it for special occasions and great deals like Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"This was an outstanding find in Madison!  Nice drinks, creative and delicious food and terrific service.  Points off for a fatty lamb dish, but the presentation and combinations would make me try it again.

Best lobster bisque I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of phenomenal. I ate so much I was ill. If you have eaten here you understand how difficult it is to not overindulge. Go for the cheese platter for an app. I loved my entree of game hen and gnocchi as well! Highly recommend for a date night"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, so badly. They have all the pieces together-- a put-together ambiance, well plated dishes, a balanced menu. Nothing is bad, really, at all. But it just didn't really seem like it had a soul. I mean, even the name of the place is uninspired. The style is new American, and nothing we really had for dinner was particularly edgy or creative. The  lobster bisque was creamy, the chick pea salad was more leafy than I expected and came out more just like a garden salad, and the gnocci was fine. Our service was great; helpful and kind. 
Like I said: I really want to like this place. But I've been twice now, and while it hasn't been bad, I'm just not particularly excited to go back. Especially in the context of the great culinary options in Madison."}
{"text":"It's been a year and I long for creamy lobster bisque with a cracklin' & touches of soft like cloud pillowy marshmallows. 

I am so proud the parfait remains on the menu. Looking forward to the wings returning. 

This place Is truly my authentic tucked away intimate yet chill atmospheric relaxed service ambience providing brunch style - dinner/happy hour type place. 

xxoox My Ode to 43North. Oh they've updated their site so if you enter from our cell you'll get the mobile version."}
{"text":"Bistrohhhhh yes!

I am totally into their small plate/large plate thing. You can order ANYTHING on the food menu in the portion you'd like. For commitment-phobic foodies this is the perfect place to nosh a little bit of everything without filling up. 

I tried a small plate of the Ratatouille (tomato, eggplant, zucchini, bell pepper), which brought me to summer while it was bone-chillingly cold outside. I got a large plate of the Blood Orange Salad (frisee, parsnip, radish, with a fennel vinaigrette) which was the most enormous salad I've ever seen and every single bite was taaaayyyyssttaay. I had a great glass of wine, which was reasonably priced.


Also, wait a second, 30% off drinks and dinner during happy hour?!?!? That makes me one happy girl."}
{"text":"Took the better half to 43 north and had what I considered to be just an OK meal. For the price I have to say I was disappointed. We started off with beef Carpaccio. I was surprised by how thick they cut the beef. Typically, Its cut much thinner. Also, there didn't seem to be much flavor. I'm not sure if they seasoned the meat or not. For dinner I had chicken and the better half had duck. The duck tasted very gamey to me. I did enjoy the service. The experience wasn't bad, it's just for the money you have a lot better choices in Madison."}
{"text":"We were seated at a table right by the front window, which was a bit of good luck right off the top. Our waiter was superb - very attentive and knowledgeable of both the menu and wine list. He made suggestions for both that were spot on. We began with a delicious amaranth cucumber salad. Our second dish was a delicate lobster bisque accented nicely by the tarragon marshmallow garnish. Our main dishes were the game hen and scallops with pea purée, both of which were spectacular. We finished our meal with the dessert sampler platter - a fine way to end indeed. This is a great establishment with a cozy dining room and top-notch staff ideal for a romantic evening out."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago for a business dinner. We started off with the board of five Wisconsin cheeses. These were oh-so-good. It came with a lovely jam that paired perfectly with some of the cheeses. The lobster bisque was too heavy for me and I couldn't get through it. I ordered the scallops, which were good but not great. I tried some of the game hen and it was spectacular. Get the game hen! Oyster and shiitake mushrooms + potato gnocchi.. Drool. 

The ambiance was quiet and cozy and our waiter was fantastic. I don't think it's the best for a large group but it's nice for an intimate dinner. The prices were decent for the quality and quantity of food you get. I really enjoyed being able to choose between small/large portions! My only qualm would be the amount of time we spent here. It took us quite a long time to get our food and we spent much longer at dinner than expected. Not sure when I'll be back in Madison, but this place was charming!"}
{"text":"How lucky can you get?

We walked into this restaurant around 5 in the evening.  Very early for dinner, but such were the circumstances.

We found ourselves in Madison, running some CDs to a recording studio.  After that, when we walked in, we were greeted by our server who was cordial.  We sat at the window and reviewed the menu.

The server made sure we knew he was ready to take our order when we were ready and explained the restaurant--creative mid-western, not crazy coastal food ideas.

We ordered a Moody Blue cheese, the beet salad, a Cassoulet, duck (the special) and Pavlova for dessert.

My partner summed up the meal--perfect in every regard.  

While everything was a standout, the standout of standouts was the cheese and the dessert.  There was a very small dipping bowl of honey and some mustard with the cheese and they were taste heaven.  We had never had a Pavlova.  It was richly sweet, with the lively fruit taste of drizzled coulis. 

They offer the choice of small plates or larger--the larger seem intended to share.

I had joked with our server that we were here for the early bird special.  When our bill came, it had a 30% discount.  I didn't understand why and asked--it turns out that on certain days, there is a happy hour discount--on everything!  

Like I asked, how lucky can you get?  Answer: Very!"}
{"text":"Almost got 3 but the cheese pairings bumped it up to 4.

I'm not saying that the food isn't great, it is. But it lacked the texture I value and expect in high end food. The menu is constantly changing but it seems like they are aware that the Lobster Bisque is a hit. Surprisingly it was the dish that had the most texture of all 6 dishes I tried.

Again, nothing was bad. Some flavor combinations were impeccable. Particularly with the cheese. Holy man, I'll go back for the cheese plates alone. They were stellar!

Our server was extremely attentive and knowledgeable. The chef presented a delicate amuse-bouche prior to bringing out warm rolls with a trio of butters, including a powdered butter. There were hints of molecular gastronomy involved with the dishes, but the plates were not overpowered by the technique. 

We were sent home with a small piece of coffee cake to remind us of our dining experience. The gesture was fantastic. The flavor was not."}
{"text":"3 stars is a little nice, 2.5 would be more accurate. Given the price and other restaurants in and around the square, I don't see myself going back.

The atmosphere is nice and our waitstaff was friendly, I will give them that. Also, their goat cheese date appetizer was very good and their Lobster Bisque is incredible! Those are the positives.

Everything else was average to below average. One thing I noticed that was a major turn off was that when we got our food, you could tell it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while, it definitely wasn't fresh and hot right out of the oven. My pork dish was good, not great, but the fries it came with were getting cold. My wife got the braised ribs and didn't like it at all. Plus, the mussels were gross, like they might have been going bad, but thankfully I didn't get sick.

2.5 stars is about right, but downtown Madison has plenty of 4 and 5 star places to choose from."}
{"text":"Bobb doesn't eat at restaurants that put pictures of their food in the window and I don't eat at restaurants that put pictures of their chef on the menu. 

(Yet we both wound up here.)

Let's chalk this experience up to me expanding my horizons and giving places another shot after they let me down once. 

Service is ok. Food is plated nicely. The menu offers something for everyone. It's nice that you can go small plate or large plate when it comes to their entrees. But it's not special. It ok. It's nice. It's fine. 

Now I feel like jerk... was that harsh? 

In my opinion harsh is spending $14 on two seared scallops. That's a lot of money. $7 per scallop if you're not good at math. Scallops aren't cheap, I get that, but I can throw a scallop into a screaming hot pan and sear on each side for a minute and a half. Who wants to give me $14? Tonight the scallops were in this weird pea puree that lacked flavor though admittedly was a beautiful color. Scallops themselves are already a bit bland, I wish there was something stronger than the pea painting my plate. Add to this the fact that my fork couldn't cut the touch sea life. You shouldn't need a knife to cut through scallops. These were over-done. 

The rest of the menu is a bit more complex taking less than common proteins and pairing them with starches in interesting ways. But at the end of the day, there is better food on the capital square. Good company helps. Both times I've been, I've thoroughly enjoyed the intimate bistro atmosphere and the people I was with. I just wish the food stood out more and resonated better with me, especially if you're going to put a picture of the guy that prepares it on your menu."}
{"text":"43 North is my favorite restaurant in Madison so far. We had an amazing meal there on Valentines day. 
-dates with goats cheese and pesto: AMAZING!!
-beef carpaccio: wonderful dish, however this is quite large for a starter and could easily be shared
-duck confit: wow! The duck was cooked to perfection, so juicy and delicious.

The wine menu was extensive and the waitress was helpful with the wine selection

We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Meh... it was ok. Go to Fresco, Graze or Le'Toile if you are feeling \"foodie\" and in Madison. 

We were here with our daughter. All of our first courses were good, not great. Hubby had Lobster bisque, D had beet soup, and I had the herring. I think the soups were better. My herring tasted like it was from a jar.

Hubby had steak, I had a fish, and D had a veggie dish. Again, all were good, not great.

We skipped dessert.

I think having been to such great places in Madison spoiled this restaurant for me. Which is just fine with me!"}
{"text":"Red Sushi was booked next door, so we walked in on 43 North...no reservations...we sat at bar and had an excellent experience. Excellent food...I had three appetizers for dinner: beet soup with pistachios, green salad with fantastic avocado fritters, scallops with incredible passion fruit beurre blanc sauce and mâché. We both had a cocktail called Mandarin Blossom, really unique drink with lime juice, hibiscus-infused water and Hangar Mandarin Vodka....awesome. Great service, inventive flavor pairings."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and this place did NOT disappoint. They have such COOL food here that are not only delicious but also visually delicious!! 

I LOVED LOVED LOVED their chicken wings....I mean really!!! Gourmet wings!!!! They were asian-ish and soooooo goood!!! I almost ALMOST cancelled the rest of our order and just asked for more wings ;)

From our friend who had been here in past months it seems like they have updated their style and menu....and for the better! It is a tapas style restaurant but the serving amounts were decent! I also had a citrus (adult) drink...can't remember the name now...but it was delicious :)

I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"After my first visit to this place, I can't imagine another place more deserving of the 5 star rating. Awesome food, awesome service, awesome atmosphere.

Mom was in town and we ventured up to the Capitol square to grab some dinner. After scoping some places out, we settled on 43 North and found a cozy table near the back. The restaurant is simple, but elegantly designed and looks almost like a snapshot of a bistro from a big city.

We shared an appetizer of roasted dates and I got the seasonal butternut squash soup. Both were pretty good, but the soup was a little bland.

For dinner, I got the potato croquettes, and was pleasantly surprised with how tasty and filling they were. The small plate/large plate option is another plus that this place offers.

I'll definitely stop back for happy hour or to try some other items on the menu. They have plenty of veggie options and everything we had was delicious!

Nicely done 43 North, see you again soon!"}
{"text":"The man and I had a gift certificate here so we decided to go on a Saturday night. We were seated promptly (we had a reservation) and our wait person was really good. She hustled the whole evening and was really pleasant. Unfortunately, the service was the best part of the meal. 

As a side note, do not go here if you are looking for a romantic dinner. You are seated about 18 inches from the tables on either side of you, and the place gets loud when it's busy. You will know what your neighbors are talking about. But we didn't want romance -- we wanted a great meal. 

We started with the goat cheese stuffed dates. I was really excited, but they were pretty meh. There was no salt or tang to counter the sweetness of the dates. And they were plated on pesto, which seemed like an odd choice that added nothing to the dish. We then had the lobster bisque that was delightful - rich, creamy, excellent flavor, and the crackling added great texture. 

It got worse from there. We split the game hen, and it was shockingly overcooked. As in dried out. The gnocchi were flavorless and chewy, and the mustard carmel sauce was pretty flavorless. We then also had a dish that does not seem to be on the menu now - a three bean stew (navy and two other kinds of beans) with some kind of meat. I can't recall the meat, sadly, because i was so freaked out by the fact that the beans were NOT fully cooked. As in crunchy. It was shocking that a higher end restaurant didn't cook their beans long enough. 

We did also splurge on the Wagyu steak. It was perfectly prepared and flavorful, but the accompanying potatoes were pretty bland.

For a $70 meal, it was pretty disappointing. Perhaps we were there on an off night, but for a nice restaurant to have two dishes on a Saturday night be poorly cooked (over- and under-) is pretty disappointing. It was our first and last meal there."}
{"text":"OK atmosphere, attentive service.

I thought the dishes were exquisite, each with a unique, delightful flavor. The other reviewers who comment on how ordinary the food is here are the same ones that say \"the cheese curds are to die for\" everywhere else.

Adding a cheese plate to your meal is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at 43 North.  We started with the lobster bisque, which in my opinion was some of the best I've ever had!  Next we had some of their fresh baked bread with house made jam, which was different but tasty.  Lastly, We enjoyed the game hen and the wagyu steak.  The steak melted in your mouth and had a great sauce accompanied with it.  The potatoes were a bit plain, but still it was a very traditional and great dish.  The Game hen was perfect.  You can't really find game hen, but it's a nice change up from chicken and I cook them alot at home.  They cooked this perfectly with just the right amount of seasonings.  The Gnocchi that accompanied the game hen however was not cooked long enough and could have been seasoned a bit more as well.  Either way everything was pretty darn good and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Based on the yelp reviews and other online reviews, we decided to try this place out for my birthday.  I've had good experiences at other Muramoto restaurants so I was hoping this one would be good as well (even if it's not a 100% Muramoto restaurant.)  I ordered the lobster bisque and wagyu steak strip.  Since everyone raved about the lobster bisque, I had high hopes for it.  I thought it was good, but not as good as expected.  I'd probably get it again, maybe.  The steak was really tender, but the flavor wasn't anything amazing.  The steak came on top of potato-hash which came on top of mushrooms and an oil-based sauce.  I really would have preferred not to have fried potatoes resting on top of an oil-based sauce.  I barely touched the potoatoes because the oil and fried potatoes weren't really working well for me.  We got the brownie and vanille creme freche for dessert.  The vanilla creme freche was good, but the brownie was just okay. 

The decor was nice, very sleek and modern, mostly.  We saw one older couple request to switch tables because the booths were a bit too short for the tables.   If Restaurant Muramoto still had its chef's tasting menu, I would have gone there instead, hands down.  Can't say that I'm eager to come back to 43 North, maybe for brunch if I'm feeling up for it."}
