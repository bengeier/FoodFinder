{"text":"Love this spot. Great quiet place to meet with friends. The margarita flat bread is amazing and the flights are a must. The servers are so friendly and very helpful. This is Southend's best kept secret, so don't tell anyone! :)"}
{"text":"Great, laid back atmosphere with such a great variety of beer on tap. They rotate different beer in all the time, so it's great to go back and check what new stuff they have. All the beer is from the Carolinas, so it's cool to support the local area breweries! The patio area is awesome. Also highly recommend the flatbreads!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and glad they did. Great place to stop in after work.  Nice selection of beers. Their appetizers were delicious and were a compliment to their beers on tap. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other night, and I can't say enough good things.  The atmosphere is so cool and relaxed, and the beer selection is wonderful.  My friend and I both had cider and split a flatbread and cheese plate.  VERY yummy.  I'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"Great little craft beer (local beer but not their own) spot. Excellent atmosphere for grabbing a beer to catching up with friends. Im not sure if they have AC but could have used it this past Saturday.  All the doors were open but it was still 80+ degrees in there.  I guess thats one way to get customers to drink more (or leave)."}
{"text":"Went to crave growers wow yes has beer on tape and eat food! Don't now How do pronunce menu but food taste good! Baretener very nice and keep give beer how can say non!)"}
{"text":"Best place in Charlotte if you want a non-douchey, non-clubby feel. Chill with awesome staff that can tell you what to order based on your palette even if you aren't a beer aficionado."}
{"text":"Craft is a great place to meet friends for a beer after work. It's a laid back environment with nice outdoor seating. There are always a big selection of great beers on tap and sometimes there is live music!"}
{"text":"Love this gem.  On one hand I want everyone I know to be aware of this place.  On the other, I don't.  I want it all to myself.  Awesome selection of drafts.  Food surprisingly good (not sure why I'm surprised, but I am).  Great service.  Perfect spot to hit before or after a Knights game."}
{"text":"Get the cheese plate & we love this spot! Thank you Craft for sponsoring the 5/14/16 South End Hops Fest. The festival is held a couple blocks away & includes beer tasting, live music & food trucks."}
{"text":"Love this place. A much needed addition to the neighborhood. Huge beer selection, great food, attentive, knowledgeable staff and a great, laid-back atmosphere. Very affordable pricing plus a great interior and exterior space. I plan on becoming a regular here - you seriously need to try it."}
{"text":"The beer selection is excellent - you will not find another one like it anywhere.  You can always find a unique beer here.  It is a great place to try a flight.

The food is excellent.  The Charcuterie and Cheese Plates are outstanding and an excellent value, as are the salads.  

Try it for the chance to try some beers you never tried, and to have a light meal that is well priced and perfectly presented.

A+"}
{"text":"GREAT beer (on tap) selection
GREAT beer (singles) selection 
My salad was REALLY tasty
The vibe was cool. Love the metal shelves and wood.
And everything is priced well

However...

The two employees were extremely laid back and my group didn't feel welcomed by them. We almost felt like we weren't wanted. The cook wasn't very professional with his presentation and the bartender was sarcastic and a bit condescending

Don't want anyone to get in trouble, but I really like this place and want to come back with friends."}
{"text":"Unquestionably my favorite craft beer bar anywhere. Always a super solid selection and variety of beers on tap, fun, friendly, and knowledgeable bartenders, and some great light bites to eat to keep your belly happy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great variety of beer and the food is really good. I love the fresh salads!"}
{"text":"It pains me to write this, but what a disappointment! I usually make fun of people who give bad ratings based on service, but now I get it.... service matters. And when things go sideways, it's much better to be honest with your customers instead of making an excuse.

An hour after we ordered we finished our two flights we checked on our charcuterie board only to be told that was the normal wait time. Half an hour longer and it turned out somehow they'd missed our order. To say we were disappointed in the service is an understatement. When we finally got our food we were so put off by the whole experience it was not enjoyable. Needless to say I doubt we will be going back and cannot recommend Craft."}
{"text":"Great food and very unique beer selection. The food always tastes very fresh. The cheese and fruit boards are delicious as well as their flatbread pizzas. Very friendly staff. Have been here a half dozen times and will keep going back."}
{"text":"This place is like a nicer Common Market. We came here on Saturday right before the Panthers game to check it out and grab a drink.

The beer selection is very very good. I would consider myself pretty well knowledged about NC beers (mainly, ok 100%, due to the fact that I drink too much!). This place actually had beers from a few breweries that I hadnt even heard of before! Prices were on par for craft beers. They also had an ok selection of bottles.

We didnt eat anything but the whole entire place smelled of delish flatbread pizza. They have salads, flatbreads, and local cheeses. Everything that came out looked amazing!

Service was just ok and parking was a bit odd since it was such a small lot. However, I this place was petty neat and we will definitely be checking it out in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here as a suggestion and I have to say, not bad. We had a little trouble finding it as Google is a bit off. They have several beers to choose from but their board is a little difficult to read.  Not all beers have the same info. What I did absolutely love were their samples.  They use  a cup the size you get for cough medicine. It gives you enough for a sample and there is no chance of overpouring. Very smart idea.  

The beers are fair and are standard prices. Decent atmosphere and when we were here during the day, they had a table set up with baked goods. They were not related to business so they may not always be here. Nice touch though. I always thought that Hawaii invented boiled peanuts. When I began educating my husband on this, who is from the South, he stated laughing.  When he finally caught is breathe, he schooled me that they are actually from the South. Well, I said I am the furthest South so.... he did not respond, got up and filled a small plate of boiled peanuts. Unfortunately,  they were too spicy for my taste buds but he loved them. A self serve water station is pretty cool too. 

As we sat enjoying our liquid goodness,  I noticed one of the bartenders increase a price on one of their beers.  I think that is inappropriate; should be done before or after opening.  Just think if you were drinking that and noticed the first one you paid this then the second is more.  I would have an issue with that.  

Found it odd that purses and other items which appears to be personal items were stacked on the right side of the bar.  There does not appear to be a place where employees can dump their stuff.  

On the plus side, they sell beer to go, growler refills too. And if you get a little hungry they have an abbreviated food menu.  Overall, this place is not bad however there really isn't anything that would bring me back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. I have been several times, but today I feel compelled to write a review. 

We sat at the (not crowded) bar for almost ten minutes before we were greeted. A man came up and we stated we wanted a flight. He handed us a card, asked us to write down five beers, and then walked away. Huh? Is this self serve? 

Five minutes later, we were able to flag down the other bartender and get our beers. No one checked in on us the rest of the time. If the service like this is repeated on our next visit, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is such a chill bar that you can come with a big group or just by yourself to grab a good beer. They have a small food menu and their charcuterie plate is delicious!! The staffs are all friendly and nice and the place is really clean!

This is by far one of our favorite bars in the area!"}
{"text":"Nice little space, open ceilings with exposed duct work and lots of natural light. The man practically stroked out because the beautiful wood bar was slapped together and slathered with wood filler at the seams. There's a little outdoor area for dogs and smokers with shade (although we learned pretty quickly not rain proof).  Bartender was friendly but not really into sharing any information about the beer. So we just picked our flights by looking at the chalkboard.  We also had the charcuterie,  pretty disappointed in it.  One tiny lump of meat (no discription given), 5 slivers of a nameless cheese, 6 crutons and a 1/4 cup of olives/red peppers. It was a Saturday afternoon, very few customers so I'm pretty sure they didn't have their 'a' game on. The beers were pretty good for being picked by name alone and the space was cool but with the number of great joints and breweries in southend, I hope they ratchet it up a notch."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Great selection of beers and bites to enjoy socializing with your friends! After with talking to the bartender and explaining my likes and dislikes she pushed me in the direction of a couple beers she recommended and even offered tastings of each to make sure i got what I wanted.  Big fan of their cherry sour cider. Got their cheese and meat boards as well and I suppose I'm being a bit nit picky here but as a suggestion I think it would benefit to have these boards served with spicy mustard and honey since they are served with bread. Thanks again for a great time!"}
{"text":"Craft is one of our favorite places to frequent. We have tried most, if not all of the breweries and craft-serving establishments for a long time now. 

It's got such a chill environment. There is care taken to not muck up the place with decor and keep the focus on quality beer. If you are having an issue finding a unique beer, odds are Craft can help fill that need. 

The staff is wonderful. If you want to get a flight but are overwhelmed, tell the bartender what you like and have them pick! When we want to fill up our growlers, Craft is the first place that comes to mind. 

Selection wise, it's really hard to compete with these guys. You can go to a brewery, but you are likely not to find the selection this place has. Speaking of which, if you still want to check out a brewery, they share a lot with Unknown Brewery, one of the more unique breweries in the area. They also share food truck fridays, which is so much better than the South End version if you have been looking to skip the huge lines and parking issues. 

If you haven't checked this place out and you like craft beer, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"so the first time I stopped here was during the Sustain Charlotte Biketoberfest, really great event to attend. Well Craft was on the list for stops, and am I am so glad we took the time to stop here. This place is a bit off the beaten path but such a great hidden gem. First thing you walk in to a huge walk-in cooler with a chalk board sign with all the draft options. There are a handful of racks with some really good bottle options. There are some really nice options if you are looking for something to take home. The Food is one thing that makes Craft such a wonderful experience. Its fresh, the Piadina's Charcutier plates are really well made and all the ingredients are really fresh and from local sources. The beer selection is pretty good it has alot of local breweries some of the more Mainstream Craft breweries as well. This is definitely a place that has been added to my go to's when we are in the South End. I will be back many more times and hope the enjoy success now just got to get them to open up a spot in the Lake Norman Area."}
{"text":"Cozy little beer room, we had an awesome time trying new beers here with our large party.  We didn't eat but it looked good. Parking lot is small so we walked from another place from south end."}
{"text":"What an absolute pleasure to sit and chill and have intelligent conversations with the bar start-up esp Melody- about just about everything. Craft beers that were recommended were spot on. Great way to start our night."}
{"text":"Ended up at craft last night while hopping around celebrating a friends birthday and the service was beyond lovely.  The food was great and the staff was awesome!  Thanks y'all! You helped us make it a special night!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax and hang with some friends. Great food and service. A definite hidden gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Solid spot if you want to drink some wine and be bad and bougey (spelling purposely incorrect because I don't have time to check the spelling of a f***ing idiotic overplayed saying), but also fun spot to chill with your homies and down some brew on the outside patio.  Totally worth going.  Good wine, good beer, good cheese, good ambience."}
{"text":"The Craft Tasting Room has a great selection of craft beer and has a great location between two breweries. Service was great and there is a large outdoor area. They do not have a full kitchen but they do serve appetizers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a VIP preview of CRAFT last night and I couldn't be happier to welcome this little gem to the neighborhood. It's located just off Morehead on S. Church behind Unknown Brewing - certainly a booming area of town and convenient to almost everything.

The focus will be on craft beer (go figure) and locally sourced meats and cheeses. They have a large bar with maybe 30 or so beers on tap - a huge selection of local and regional breweries - and a few tables. Meeting friends for a drink and bite after work? CRAFT's your place to go. Want to fill up a growler with your favorite local brew? CRAFT's your place to go. Need to write a paper for class? CRAFT's your place to go. Think: Good Bottle Co. meets Common Market.

The space itself boasts original brick, exposes beams, natural lighting, and aged piping. The seating features those ubiquitous metal tabouret chairs and stools - yes the uncomfortable one's every new restaurant seems to have. They also have an outdoor biergarten with several picnic benches. 

The only thing that seemed iffy to me was parking. There is a small lot out front that was unclear whether or not could accommodate cars. Keep in mind there are still kinks to work out with a place so new.

Best part? It's locally owned by an adorable beer-loving, ambitious couple who somehow pumped this place out with four children ages 6 months to 10. Now that's impressive!"}
{"text":"He Said:

Pretty straight-forward: really nice tap selection paired with really nice people leads to a great experience.  We stopped by here while on a mini pub-crawl and couldn't be happier.  She had been here before, so it wasn't a great surprise, but even so the feelings about the spot were increased.  I can't speak to the food, but the beer is a mix of ultra-local, semi-local, and not-local and it's all very well done.  If there's a negative I can't spot it. 

She Said:

I visited here a year ago, and I remember thinking that if I lived in the neighborhood I wouldn't go anywhere else. I insisted to He that we visit on our recent trip to Charlotte, and we liked it so much we looped around twice in one evening. Great beers on tap. Lovely people hanging at the bar. Helpful bartenders. We'll be back, I'm sure, and when we return we might be able to comment on the food.

Potty Points: I went to the bathroom. Yes. I think it was good, and I have not lasting negative impressions, so I'll give it 4 out of 5 potty points. Next time I'll visit after my first beer rather than after my fourth and sixth beers!"}
{"text":"Wow. I loved craft so much! Great beer selection, outdoor movie showings, overall great spot. 

Today, was different! I am not one to arbitrarily throw a one star review, but, I cannot stand when an establishment won't honor their mistakes. 

We ordered a $6 meat board and $6 cheese board at the same time and sat outside with our friends. Our order number was 17 and the meat board came within 5-10 minutes. The server took our number 17 emblem away from the table which was confusing... my girlfriend followed in shortly after to ask about the cheese. 

The bartender was snotty and said \"... yeah... they take a while\" and assured her it was on the way. 10 minutes later, I went in, and was more persistent. 

They offered to make a new one but at our expense. Despite the mistake. I'm sorry but that isn't how you keep customers."}
{"text":"So look no further
I am from  north of France next to Belgium 
Don't look any further for beer ( craft beer)
This place has it all 
Great service devon will help you

Great atmosphere
Great combination with beer ( fromage de chevre with beer is a hit) only chef know about it
Best craft beer bar in Charlotte so far"}
{"text":"This place actually gets it. Small enough to be a comfortable atmosphere but big enough to have a lot of great beers on tap. 

I'm a white wheat kind of guy and loved the beer Dan picked out. Great place check it out!"}
{"text":"Great, comfortable, and fun place. Management is great, service is fast and even when busy. This is like my \"cheers\" and the atmosphere is super fun. A go to place with 36 beer choices and that rotate often and a great small kitchen menu."}
{"text":"Like this place a lot. Stopped by for a beer before panthers game. Will go at next opportunity with my wife for beers and some appetizers."}
{"text":"The service is TERRIBLE. Do not come here unless you have time to wait 38 minutes for a beer. The bartender did not even care that he wasn't doing his job. Another employee finally helped us and was very apologetic, but we will never be back. Don't even waste your time - you can get all the beers they offer at any other bar or brewery in the city within blocks of this location. Might be a great place to park..."}
{"text":"Great service and selection. If you are looking for a patio and the perfect getaway from the city lights, stop by craft.  Amy is one of the funniest people you will meet in the city. Try the food as it will not disappoint.  Stop by to pick up a few bottles for dinner or a fun weekend with friends."}
{"text":"Craft has one of the best beer selections I have found in Charlotte. Charlotte has a ton of great breweries, but if you'd like a wider selection of great beers I'd recommend stopping into Craft Tasting Room. They had over 20 beers on tap when I stopped in and a wide selection of hard to find bottled beer.

They also have a small selection of food items. I've tried both the cheese board and pizza. The pizza is small and made on a tortilla but it's well priced and has great toppings. I would definitely recommend the cheese board. For 9$ you get a great looking cheese plate covered with bread, nuts, some fruits, and two local cheeses."}
{"text":"What a huge selection of craft beers!! And believe it or not, the food is amazing as well! 

Great vibe, very friendly staff, and it has a great atmosphere to boot! 

It's a nice spot to watch football, they play the audio throughout the place and it's not crazy crowded with meat head football fans."}
{"text":"We love the Nutella Dessert Pizza! Wednesday's are $6 charcuterie plates. The pizzas are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"It took my forever, but I finally made it over to Craft!  Great on draft selection of beer.  There was a wide variety and the staff was well informed.  They have a bottle and can section as well.  It may not be as big as some of the other places, but they do tend to have stuff other people don't.  Also, they have flatbreads and other foods for like $7.  There is nice outside seating and a couple TV's as well."}
{"text":"Craft is the go-to for my friends and I on a week night. Plenty of beer on tap, and they always have at least one cider. I would give them 5 stars if they would give more options for us cider drinkers. There are a couple of tables that can accommodate large groups, but it's the kind of place that's not weird for people to just stand around and mingle that way. The patio is really cute with string lights and picnic benches. Music is usually good and pretty loud. Their dedicated parking lot is small but there's a gravel area and plenty of street parking. Single stall bathrooms can create a line on a busy night. They offer charcuterie and personal sized, house - made pizzas. Never had a bad time here!"}
{"text":"I was tempted to give this place a 1-star rating and a scathing review. Why? Because Craft has become my favorite watering hole in Charlotte and well, if everybody knows about it, they'll ruin it for me. I love being able to pull up a bar stool and have some friendly banter with the chill bartenders while I complete the difficult task of selecting (5) brews from their wide assortment. I know; life is hard for me. To think I stumbled in because Unknown was closed. I love it here seriously. 

Location: 5/5
On the same block as my favorite brewery (Unknown). Not too much traffic around so parking is not an issue during regular weekends and weekdays. The only time this location can be a potential negative is during the Panther's game. You're smack dab in the middle of tailgating central.

Ambiance / Atmosphere: 5/5
There's decent sized seating outside for those who dig drinking under the sun / in the shade. On the inside you'll find yourself a good amount of tables and shelves stocked with craft beer. The bar is my go-to. There's some televisions if you're like the 98.99% of Americans who enjoy viewing some sports with their beer. 

Cleanliness: 5/5
Nice and clean. Craft still has that new car smell.

Service: 5/5
The bartenders are awesome. They're approachable and friendly. 

Beer: 6/5
Tons of delicious beers on tap. Whatever your tastebuds desire, I'm pretty sure they have a brew that can fulfill the need. You can opt for beer that tastes like smooth, creamy peanut butter or jalapeno nacho cheese. Get a flight and try 5 beers for around $7. This place is by far my favorite when it comes to sitting back and relaxing with some good quality beer.

Food: 5/5
The flatbread pizza is delicious as well and will run you about $8. There's also a cheese plate option or two on the menu if you want to keep it fancy."}
{"text":"What to do on a rainy Monday night? Man this place was hopping. Have been here twice for a DIY craft class with Crown Town Handmade- Kimi Pace is an awesome instructor. 

Huge beer selection. Sorry folks not a heavy duty beer drinker myself. More of a wine connoisseur. What is it about beer, wine, or any hard core liquor? An acquired taste. The only thing I will drink is a Radler- My first exposure was at the Munich Brauhaus out in Germany. It was life changing and the search for Radler in the states were never the same until I tried the Stiegl Grapefruit Radler at Craft Tasting Room. Just love it. Wonderful memories of traveling to Austria and Germany. 

First time, I walked from Uptown which is a cool hike and great workout. I almost missed the white building. There are picnic tables on one side of the building and once you walk in you are taken back to a neat dive. 

Go to the bar area and place your order. Order a flight- 5 glasses- They are cute smaller glasses than the regular beer one's. Write on the tag what you like. If you are not sure ask the bartender, she will give you a sample to try and help you out. 

Their pizza's are good (thin crusted), so is their cheese plates, and pretzels too. They will give you a number-you put on table and once food ready they will bring it to you. Was happy to bring back a flight of 5 to test drive. 

Look at the black board in the bar area. They have daily specials- On Monday's -flight cost total of $7 ($6.50 plus tax) which is a great deal. Good thing I ordered 2 of the Stiegl Grapefruit Radler, the pumpkin and tangerine was not sweet enough for me. Cider was good. Meeting new friends, sharing pizza & beer on a rainy night makes life so much fun. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm two for two on really awesome nights out at Craft. 

For the beer geek: they have an impressive tap selection including local and regional picks

For the non-drinker: artisan soda and kombucha

For the snacker (aren't we all): their thin crust pizzas are addictive

The thing that will keep me coming back is their service. I mused out loud my search for a sour beer and three sample pours appeared on the bar. What made this impressive is that they were slammed on a Friday night and pouring unrequested samples. 

Second example of great service- when heading inside to order food I grabbed empty glasses to bring in. Before I could make it two steps they were intercepted. 

You can hang here for hours and not be rushed off. Skip the heels ladies as they have gravel outside. Dog friendly inside and out. 

Note their daily specials too. Half off growlers and other such goodies. 

Two quick less than stellar notes: one restroom each for men and women means a wait during peak hours and you'll have to park on the surrounding side streets."}
{"text":"Craft is super casual and semi rustic place which is absolutely perfect for a glass of beer and fun with your besties.  Being at a walking distance from our apartment, it was only recently that we made it to Craft and loved it.  I was assuming Craft was a brewery but quickly learnt they aren't and server beers from local and national breweries.  
The bar tender was nice, patient and smiling and did a good job interacting with her customers and being very attentive.  
It was our first time and we did not know how things work there, for if we need a table.  We were standing in the middle of the restaurant and staring around assuming someone would notice us and direct lol, before we went to the bar and asked how to order food and drinks.  (bar seating was full by the way).
We started looking at the food menu and a customer at a nearby bar seat told us that day was $6 special on cheese plates.  Thank you Sir!! but then I found the specials were written on black board placed on top right corner above the beer taps.
The cheese plate was delicious, two different types of cheese, couple different nuts, bread and some dried fruits.  Went pretty well with our beers.  Per their website the cheeses are organic, way to go Craft!!  We also ordered a pretzel at the end, which was super soft and perfectly salted on the outside, and I believe the side was a super strong mustard sauce.  
My absolute fav. was the Nicklepoint Belgian ale and wife loved the Lost province kolsch.  
Definitely worth the place for regular visits and the décor just makes you feel at ease.  Service was a little delayed but hey it was around 7PM and the house was full."}
{"text":"This is an awesome tasting room. The bar staff is excellent and really know their beers.  There is an outside patio, an outside smoking area and a great inside bar. You can taste any of their beers on tap!  They have a huge variety of craft beers. The also have a nice food menu as well. I plan to return again."}
{"text":"I've gone back a few times since the food debacle over a year ago. The service has been much better, though I've still yet to touch the food. I wish the beer chalkboard was more organized so you could find by style or brewery a little bit easier. Will probably continue to try from time to time since I like the concept."}
{"text":"Craft is the perfect taproom to explore a wide variety of beers that you (likely) won't find many other places.  With 36 rotating taps, you'll find sours, stouts, IPAs, saisons, ambers, browns, etc.    Order a flight to try several beers in one sitting.  

While you're there, do yourself and your friends a favor and order the meat plate AND the fruit/cheese plate.  You can also grab some spicy, boiled peanuts to snack on for free against the far wall (to the right of the bar when you're facing it).  

There is an awesome patio with a large firepit (not burning in the summer, thank goodness) that rounds out a great venue.

If you don't have time to stick around, Craft fills growlers to-go and offers a large selection of bottles to take home."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great beer selection. Great prices. The food offering is perfect. Not too much - just enough food to accompany a few beers. Check it out for a business lunch or drinks before dinner."}
{"text":"Craft is right up my beer-loving alley. With a huge selection of brewers, heavy on the IPA/hoppy side (perfect for yours truly) but diverse enough to please a crowd. Most pints range in the $5-$6 price line but make sure you take note of their weekly specials. {Do note: prices on the blackboard don't include tax!}

Pleasant atmosphere that is conducive for the patio goer, bar-sitter or table dweller. You'll find bottles big and small to take home but you'll have to refrigerate it before drinking (the only thing ready-to-drink take home drinks here are the non-alcoholic or growlers). And don't worry, if you're hungry after a few pints, they've got you covered, with everything from snackie-finger foods to flat breads. And for all your non-beer drinkers, they've also got you covered with all your wine needs. 

My tip: if you're picking up a six pack/growler to go, make sure you note their non-beer items including chocolates, pasta sauces and cocktail mixers. It's a random assortment, but would make for a unique gift for a party!"}
{"text":"Cool place with a good beer selection and relaxed atmosphere. They have tvs for watching sports but they're not overwhelming if you're there to hang out or have a conversation. The place is nice and clean, including the women's bathroom. I didn't get any of the food but the cheese plate looked amazing so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a neat place Charlotte has! This little hangout in the Southend is a great place to meet friends after work for a beer or food. Went there with some friends from church on a Tuesday night and enjoyed the $7.50 flights! Five beers of your choosing for quite an affordable price.  Food looked OK, but venue is great - love the outdoor seating where people can bring their dogs.  Definitely planning on coming back!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. The flatbread pizzas were awesome and the staff was friendly. Great hidden gem."}
{"text":"Best service ever! Bartenders are friendly and personable. Food is amazing! 50% off on Sunday's! Love it here! Go to Craft!"}
{"text":"Staff was a great time. They had great energy and the atmosphere is super chill. We had a flight, charcuterie board and the prosciutto flatbread. Everything was great. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Craft has a nice selection of beer and a modest amount of appetizers. After sampling three beers, I settled for a pint of the World Court White Chocolate Mocha Stout. Clear blonde appearance, little head with no retention, and visibly very carbonated. Aromatics of white chocolate, roasted coffee, and toffee. Tastes as it smells, but more subtle; it is medium bodied, slightly sweet, with low bitterness. I was pleased to say the least.

Ordered the Greek Pizza, Margarita Pizza, & the Charcuterie.

The pizza's (flatbread) were good for what they were, but the Charcuterie was the star of the table.

Service was prompt (Tuesday night) and employees were friendly. 

Overall, I was satisfied and I would come back again."}
{"text":"I really loved the feel of Craft. I was excited to try it out and invited my friends there for a drink and food. I am still feeling completely uncomfortable about my experience there. I was waiting for the women's bathroom to open and speaking to a stranger waiting in line for the men's. We spoke how you'd think a place so busy and successful would have more than 1 stalls. We then discussed how busy it's been and when it's warmer we can all stretch outside to the cute courtyard. We then talked about how multiple girls use the bathroom at the same time and just pointless small talk-- all in jest. I can remember clearly what was said. No harm and I actually was excited to come back. Suddenly, the women's bathroom door swings open and one of the bartenders walked out with her arms flailed and yells \"welcome to the complaint department!!\" I turned around to see her storm away and all the people around looked at me. I was mortified as my comments in no way were meant to complain or criticize Craft. I am not sure how our conversation even was overheard or manipulated. The company I was with witnessed her behavior and were shocked at her outlandish behavior. I love the beer selection and the food looked yummy, but the bartenders attitudes were completely hostile."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding. I've never had a better flatbread anywhere. And I could not get enough of the prosciutto. Alas, I don't drink but if I did, I'd probably do it at Craft. I love the ambiance."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Super cool and chill vibe. We came by Sunday afternoon after a bike ride with a few bags of groceries and our bartender offered to keep the cold stuff in their fridge! Really awesome. We also ordered olives which technically isn't on the menu and they were totally open to it. Very inviting and cool people."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  My original review is below, which I'm leaving because it wasn't my proudest moment to have written it at all, and Craft gets a HUGE gold star for having responded the way they did.  The bartender who made these comments reached out to my roommate and I personally to apologize and invite us back.  We both agreed that night wasn't our classiest moments, and overall, the truth is that my roommate and I LOVE everything about Craft.  Their selection is always on point, and their bartenders are sweet and clearly genuinely care about the experience you have there.  



ORIGINAL:
We LOVE craft, my roommate and I. We go very often, they have an awesome selection and the bartenders know us. But. We were just there for the super bowl. We're pats fans, and I know, we're not all that popular down here haha. But the bartender, who we've had before and has been nice before, asked us if we could go to a patriots viewing place. She didn't want us there. And THEN she rooted and cheered when our players were injured. 

Idk what team you root for, or who you are. We're all people. It's not okay to celebrate another human getting injured. And it's not okay to make your regulars feel that uncomfortable. Shame on you guys. We loved it here and now we'll be taking our business to Hoppin."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best beer joints in Charlotte. The selections, the atmosphere, the staff, owner....the best. Not to mention, the food, simple but elegant. I get withdraws if I haven't been there in awhile."}
{"text":"Forget Sunday Funday, Craft gives you a reason to get up and out on Mondays with their special on an order of five 7oz samplers from their ever-changing 36 option tap list. Quintessentially South End, there is a small and purposeful menu, along with a large display of chip bags to provide some salt and crunch to contrast your liquid libations.

I like the options for seating, both high-tops inside and picnic tables with shade outside and they have a well-stocked selection of beers and small grocery items to take home. I agree with the owners' concept that craft beer, meat and cheese are also a few of my favorite things! Great for date night or out with friends, Craft is tucked away just a few blocks from the Blue Line."}
{"text":"We tried Craft again with basically the same results. Bellied up to the bar around 2:30 on a Saturday and waited... and waited... and waited. Even though 3 people were working the bar, one was deep in conversation with a customer, and the other 2 were completely ignoring us. Finally one bartender sort of acknowledged us just to say she'd be there in a minute. 

As we drank, we noted the food that was being made. Even though they have a 98 sanitation rating, we saw that the pretzels are literally right next to the trash can, and on a couple of occasions, I saw bartenders throw trash into it from 8-10 feet away. You can't tell me trash has never wound up in that pretzel bin. Yuck. And the guy making the food was wearing gloves, but then he was touching non-food things with those gloved hands. 

We asked for our bill, and waited... and waited... and waited. The bartender we asked had completely disappeared, so we had to flag down another bartender to get it for us.

I hate to say it since they do have a pretty interesting tap list, but we've officially crossed Craft off the list."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. They open early enough for a good beer brunch. Sheena was a great bartender with a lot of good recommendations. This is a great neighborhood bar that feels like a home away from home."}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm a beer enthusiast from San Francisco and this place has everything I could want. Great small food plates with a wide variety on tap, including an even larger variety of bottles for purchase. I even found more bay area breweries in bottles than I have found in any other bottle shop outside of the SF bay area.

Dan, the owner is an incredibly nice guy, as was the bar tender that served us. I recommended anyone who likes beer to come check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Stopped in for a drink on the way to unknown and love the vibe, drink and food selection. Definitely a great place to nosh on some small plates and drink a couple of cold brews!"}
{"text":"Nicely located in Southend, they offer a large selection of beer on tap. They generally have a good range of all types of beer but run heavy on IPA's. They also offer wine, snacks, Cheese plates and other goodies. It's fun to stop in here for a drink or three."}
{"text":"Craft has become my favorite bar in Charlotte and really my only complaint is that it has become other people's favorite bar, too, and it gets crowded on weekends. 

The beer selection--somewhere around 30 taps--is always expertly curated, with a good mix of local beer and stuff I've never heard of before. The bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly; they know me by name now. 

I always feel like I'm stealing when I order food. The pizzas are stupid cheap. My favorite, with mozzarella, prosciutto and pickled chiles, is like $8. Craft has an awesome cheese board, too, and don't miss the free boiled peanuts at the far end of the bar."}
{"text":"I guess the secret is getting out about this place. I've been in South End for a year and just managed to check out this little northwest corner of South End (or I guess you could call it the southwest corner of Uptown too). I drink a lot of craft and was blown away by how many breweries on the board I've never heard of. I had to do a flight here. These are some of the biggest pours (guessing 6oz.) you'll see on any flight in Charlotte and you'll get 5 of them for $11 (I believe they run a special on flights one night). A lot of IPA's but they also had a nice selection of even higher gravities that qualify for the flight. Get a flight, sample a few sips of each and put an order in for one of their delicious pretzels. It comes with a brown spicy (horseradish) mustard. Combine this with friendly bartenders and an awesome acoustic musician that night and Craft gets one of my rare 5-star ratings."}
{"text":"Great beer selection (you can get a sampler for $9 if you are not sure what you want) and good light food that goes with it"}
{"text":"Fun spot to go with a group. They have a great outdoor patio and a huge selection of beers. This is place is definitely on my list of weekend activities when I have friends visiting Charlotte. Food is great for a quick snack and the location is super convenient."}
{"text":"Came for a beer! Tired one I never had before. They have a good selection on tap and bottles within store to buy to drink there or take home. With a special almost every day of the week, not on fridays though. Neat little spot, that has pizza and cheese boards. I actually wanted to do a dessert/beer pairing but they do not have those! I saw a picture on here of one, but that must have been a one time thing."}
{"text":"Craft Tasting Room - Oh how I love thee, let me count the ways... hold on, I have to take my shoes off because it's more than ten!!

 The light, bright white brick exterior is a great representation of what awaits you inside - a light airy space that really welcomes you. Think of a dark, gloomy wood filled pub, then think of the opposite which is Craft. 
 
 A flight of five generous pours from an amazing selection of craft brews will cost you $9. Besides the beer and the genuinely friendly staff, what I enjoyed most was the incredible charcuterie platter. Wow! This thing was SEXY! It was all I could do to keep my cool and not pounce on it! The young man who made it is definitely a food artist. North Carolina prosciutto, Spanish Manchego cheese, pecans, fresh pear and strawberries and buttered, herbed toast rounds all modeled gracefully on a wooden cutting board. Definitely worthy of a picture in Saveur Magazine!!

 There's an outdoor patio for the recent beautiful weather. Parking is limited, so use the alley, or the street; they share parking space with Unknown Brewing."}
{"text":"Set nicely in a small area most would think is part of uptown but its actually southend. To popular demand of creating neighborhood feelts, and \"nick names\" of sorts, this area is distinctively called Goldcoast. There is a lot happening in this area and its exciting but one of the many firsts to pop up in this area and I am still trying to think why on earth I haven't written a review on this place is beyond me, Ive been here many times, and many more to come. Reason number one, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! Charlotte, we need to keep this #1, its not happening everywhere and if you've read any of my reviews, im a stickler for this. Very large list of varieties of beers, not just Charlotte beers, because lets just be honest, I live in Charlotte and I can drive to any of these breweries, whenever I want, why do I need them on draft at every bar, restaurant or taphouse? No, I don't and that is my point, Craft does it right spreads the love. Their food is actually really good, my personal favorite is both their meat and cheese board, great selections, great price point. They also offer wine and its a good list as well. Its small inside but well laid out. They also have a small outside patio. I wish they would open one up on my side of town - NODA needs more of this (hint hint). So why not five stars, its small and wish it were bigger. I wish they had more bottles of wine to choose from but this is not to say I am not coming back, because I am. Cheers~"}
{"text":"Rude and cold bartenders, had to flag down a bartender after being passed over several times with money in our hands. New bartender did a better job than the experienced bartender who was just here to serve her friends. Both didn't seem happy to be there at all. Short and dismissive when we finally got service. Staff has a long way to go if they want to have repeat business. Great food, great beer and wine selection. (Friday May 1, 2015)"}
{"text":"I dragged my wife here after she dragged me to Gallery next door. I needed a beer after that experience.

We just came in for a one-and-done visit, and Craft delivered. They have a nice variety of beers on tap, a decent selection of bottles (lackluster compared to many other bottle shops), and nice food menu. Since we had just eaten, we didn't get any food here, but the menu definitely caught my attention. 

The thing I liked most was the space itself. Aside from the bizarre painting of some sort of alien Cam Newton on the wall, the decor is great. From the bar itself to the industrial-looking bottle shelves and the garage door for warmer days, I loved the feel of Craft. 

I didn't love the service. For a relatively slow time on a Monday, the bartender working paid little to no attention to new customers arriving. 

Had the service been better, we probably would have stayed for more (it doesn't take much to convince me to drink more beer), and we probably would come back, but it wasn't and we won't. There are much better tasting rooms and bottle shops in the area. I might give it another try down the line, but I'm in no hurry."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up a growler instead of our usual spot in town. Ok selection And did offer tasters before purchasing. No price was listed on the beer we chose when all of the other selections were $10-$20 for a 64 ounce growler. Ours rang up at $39! Are you freaking serious? That's $9.75 per beer. I feel like if you have no price listed and a product is nearly double what all of the others are that you should at least let your customer know before purchasing. Also wasn't sealed securely so we ended up losing some in the car on the way home. We will keep going to The Beer Growler instead for our growler fills."}
{"text":"What we have here is a good business approach to the beer loving crowd.  Multiple taps of craft beer and not just craft but DIVERSE craft beer.  I don't need 40 taps and 30 of them be IPAs.  I like creative beers.

Additionally, the food looked amazing and will have to try on my next visit.  Local cheeses, flat bread pizzas, etc.

I love the idea you can get a pint, a growler, some food AND some bottles to take home all under the same roof.

The seating area isn't huge but it is ample.  There is an outdoor patio but from what I could tell it was a bit on the small side.  The interiors are raw and rustic much like the current trend everywhere which is fine. The parking is a little tough and the location is hard to find for first timers."}
{"text":"This place blew my socks off...seriously, last time I saw them they were going Mach 2 soaring through the troposphere.  Craft Tasting Room & Growlers Shop is that place where they treat you like a regular, even if it's your first time.  It's quiet and relaxing, yet allows for you and your friends to be a slightly obnoxious at the other end of the bar - guilty as charge.  And the beer... let me tell you because that's the only reason your here.

They have a ton of beer!  The beer section is vast and compiled on a large chalk board since it rotates weekly - which is a good business model I might add, compels you to buy a growler. 
But seriously, so much beer!  It was like trying to analyze a Jackson Pollock painting.  My eyes were bouncing around like a racquet ball, I didn't know where to start.  Mondays are Flight Night, $7.50, deal alert!  I scribbled down my beers and this is what my Flight consisted of: Holy City Washout Wheat, Triple C 3C, Bombshell IPA, Huske Hardware Watermelon Wheat and Cavendish Ave Maria IPA.  Every single one was amazing-zing-zing, highly recommend.  

But what I think really made the evening were the bartenders, Sheena and Nikki.  They were awesome.  Also, being that I just moved here, the two made me feel right at home and showed patience; thank you.

I will be back to enjoy the atmosphere, try more beer and have a good laugh...and won't wear socks.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"You guys, I love this place. Beer selection is a given, but let's talk about the other stuff:

1) The food. I've had a wide range on their menu: the work-of-art cheese platters, the flatbreads, the piadinas. The star of the show is the sopresatta, pecorino, and strawberry preserves piadina. Perfect marriage of sweet meets savory. (And unexpectedly so!)

2) Atmosphere. Warmly with a refreshing, clean twist. Metal chairs line community table seating. Wooden countertops, polished concrete and chalkboard menus. Folk music usually plays in the background in a way that invites the occasional hum-along without overbearing the conversation. There's a patio attached that is dog friendly; they even have a water bowl. Bonus: open shelving line the perimeter with fancy artisanal goods and bottled beers.

3) The service. Knowledgable people I can count on for a recommendation. It can be a bit slow in regards to food, but I don't mind. When I go there, I'm there to hang out with friends and relax. Sometimes it just takes time to craft.

Easily a wonderful (and much needed) neighborhood spot. Thank you for the wonderful addition!"}
{"text":"Such a fantastic craft beer location. A tremendous beer selection, including tapped beers and bottled beer for purchase. Staff was a little cold, but will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Craft is my kinda place.  Beer, meat and cheese boards, flatbreads with a great indoor/outdoor atmosphere.  My wife and I recently visited on a Friday afternoon to watch some NCAA tourney games and have a few drafts.  They had the burial surf wax on tap, one of my favorite beers right now.  My wife had the hornets nest from OMB, also solid.  Severs are always attentive and willing to help you find a beer you will like.  I love the menu, simple, great value and one of tastiest you will find in a place like this.  Great place to watch a game, grab some after work beers or spend a sunny Saturday afternoon.  If you go make sure you get the charcuterie board, best value in town for $9.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a really awesome go-to for me and my fiance for date night, to bring out-of-towners, to sample a bunch of NC beers, or buy some bottles. They have a ton on tap, most of it from NC, and a variety of everything from sours, to IPAs, to wits, to stouts. Flights are reasonably priced and you get 5 pretty generous pours. The bottle selection is also pretty extensive and they carry 4-packs, 6-packs, singles and bombers.

Craft is on the smaller side, so on a Friday or Saturday night, it can be a little hard to get a seat at this place, or even to the bar, but the service has always been super fast, so I've never actually had to wait that long. They also have a very nice patio with a tent covering, so you can go sit out in the summer months. During the colder months I believe they also trade out coverings for a fire pit instead. I also really enjoy coming on a weeknight or during the middle of the day because it's a quiet intimate place to actually have a conversation with someone over a good pint. 

Food-wise, they offer a good number of flatbreads. I've had their artichoke one, which has no red sauce, but is very cheesy and has lemon juice or something else citrus drizzled over it. I thought it was nice and light but still very yummy."}
{"text":"As much as I love this neighborhood bar, & the convince & quickness of the flat breads & draft beer. Today was a little disturbing. Being in the restaurant business for over 15 years, the girls behind the bar were far from professional. Dropping sample cups on the ground & then putting them in there mouth, while they stood there and talked to the cook, as I waited for at least 4 min. the shift relief girl that came in was worse  no bra in a tank top & cussing in front of customers at the bar. Just a turn off if you ask me. I think the male bartenders there are the rock to keeping that place up to par."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Free boiled peanuts, awesome rotating drafts, and the local cheese plates are to die for. Dog friendly patio area and rare brews for sale. This place is a home run!"}
{"text":"Great time. The only problem I see no dishwasher. They hand wash every cup and dish. How clean can they get?"}
{"text":"Beautiful Saturday afternoon... bike... light rail corridor... this was one of our stops.  I love how this growler shop is tucked in it's own little corner of Southend.     The moment you walk in, you get a cool.. relaxed vibe... usually can smell some yummy snacks the folks are preparing behind the bar.  Nothing really elaborate, but cheese/meat plates...  flatbreads... and salads.  Super tasty and picture worthy.

Have a couple beers at the bar while waiting for your growler to get filled... or just drink at the bar.  The actual bar is a natural wood slab... so great to look at and even better to drink at.  There are some small shelves that holds retail beer selections and a great outdoor patio... I'm sure I'll be sitting out there during the summers.

Even better... nice bike parking right at the front of the building.  Since they are niched in their little area, parking can be a little tricky, but I'm sure you can find some street parking easily.  It's right behind Unknown brewing so it's definitely a happening area.  There's a dessert place opening up soon, right next door."}
{"text":"Another craft beer shop and of course I had to check it out.  Being one to go when  places are less busy I saw that they offered food and decided on an early lunch.

Unfortunately, I drove by twice and there was no indication that they were open and drove off. But I returned after lunch and finally saw cars there.  There is a small parking lot in front and there is plenty of street parking. During the day, there is a 2-hour limit on street parking.

Once inside the first thing you see is a food menu of sandwiches, flatbreads, salads and such. There a meat/cheese case and a slicer where they actually cut their own meat.

To the right is a decent sized bar with taps on the coolor behind the bar.  Around the room is shelving for the beers, wine and specialty products they have for sale and a few tables for seating.

I sat at the bar and looked at the extensive beer tap list.  The difference between this place and other taprooms is the variety of NC beers - beers that you won't find at any other location in Charlotte including those from Catawba, Blowing Rock, Granite Falls, Appalachian Mountain, Blue Mountain, etc.  There were several of the locals represented including NoDa, OMB, Birdsong and Triple C. And there were also beers from around the country including Humboldt and Finch's.  

I settled on a stout from from Finch's which was one of the better stouts I've tasted.  

The bottled selection is not that great right now but I attribute that to the place being new.  Service wise, it was just ok.  Sometimes I enjoy sitting at a bar and chatting with the staff but they really weren't that chatty. Hopefully that will improve as well as the get more customers.

So I'd give this a review of 3 1/2 due to their variety of beer and the food offerings which smelled wonderful.  I will likely come back after the newness wears off."}
{"text":"OMG...I wish this place was close to my house instead of being over 3 hours away. I would drink here at least once a week!! My BF and I stopped in here last Saturday after enjoying the day in Charlotte. They have so many delicious craft beer choices. You can get a flight for $11!! The glasses are almost twice the size of your typical beer flight glasses. Higher ABV beers are a wee bit extra, but you can still add them to your flight. Our favorite was the Wicked Weed Bourbon Barrel Stout. WOW, that's a delicious beer! The bartenders were both awesome and very knowledgeable of the beers on tap. They also have growlers and bottles for purchase. If you're downtown Charlotte and you love drinking at cool bars with delicious beer and great music, you definitely need to stop here!!"}
{"text":"This is like a 2.5 - not a great experience, but we had fun and it worked out.  

First off, I am not a beer guy (I'll do cider or wine, or some girly mixed drink), so the awe-inspiring selection was somewhat wasted on me.  Why go here then?  Well, several friends are more into beer, and my wife enjoys it somewhat too, so I am along for the ride.  Even if it's a mediocre cider or just water and a bite, I'm there to have fun with friends.  I have a low bar, I'm as easygoing as they come.  

So there is a large wrap-around bar, with maybe ten tables of various sizes dotted around the beer shelves - small ones for 2 or 4 to sit at, and 3 large countertop ones that can accommodate more like 8.  All were full when I got there saturday evening, but I had a party of 5 coming in, so all we could do was stand around and wait to vulture a table when some folks left.  It actually worked out for us, but a lot of people were left standing around awkwardly without any seat or even counter - hey, it's a bar, it's packed, all good.  I've seen some reviews mention quiet folk music, but Saturday nights are more hopping - not bad music, just more loud bar level.  

Everything is ordered at the bar - employees don't come around unless they are dropping off food or bussing the tables, the latter of which did not occur for the table next to us for about three hours (they started taking the overflow back up to the bar themselves).  I ordered the cheese and charcuterie plates with our drinks, at 7:32pm - this is cured stuff, no cooking, just slicing/arranging.  At around 8:05 I went back to the bar to check on the status, and was told they're a little backed up - ok, fine.  By 8:20 my table was getting restless, and the table next to ours was enlisted in the cause.  At 8:35 an employee walked by with both trays - I asked if those were ours, showed her my slip, but she circled the entire bar and then went back to the counter.  I had to practically tackle her and show her my receipt and number to get the plates, which she just handed to me to take back to our table.  Cheers erupted when the other tables saw we had finally gotten our order.  But hey, they were good!  

Overall this place is great for the beer connoisseur, but is lacking organizationally - it's new-ish, so maybe that's expected.  The beer selection was extraordinary, with everyone in the party finding ones they loved, and some they hated.  The flatbreads and cheese/meat trays were great, when they finally arrived.  And we had a good time, the most important thing of all.  I would advise checking it out outside of Friday/Saturday nights, you might get much better service."}
{"text":"Place was nice, open, and inviting. However, bartender not too helpful on beer choices. When asking for her opinion on a couple choices she let me chose between the two by tasting myself instead of her opinion. When ordering my second beer I wanted the same one I got earlier but accidentally ordered something completely different but she didn't say or ask anything regarding the matter. I take the blame for ordering wrong and drank the beer she gave me but I believe a good bartender should remember especially when she has your tab and knows the different beers. Good place for trying out different local brews though!! And parking lot is tiny!! But you should easily find parking on the street nearby."}
{"text":"It is mid-afternoon on a Friday. The budget this month took a hit with the holiday weekend but we still want to go out. Cue perfectly timed email from Restauarant.com with $4 for $25 off coupons, one of which included the Craft Tasting Room. After seeing the great pictures on Yelp we were super excited for a cheese and charcuterie dinner and to unwind with some beers.

Our Uber driver actually had some difficulty finding this place, it is a large white building but GPS dropped us off at the corner instead of in front of the building. If you end up at the intersection of S Church St and Lincoln St it is just a little bit further up S Church. 

When we walked in we were a little confused about the process. We sat at a small table for a couple minutes waiting for a server then decided we must be expected to order from the bar. It was a little awkward to try to order food and beer at the same time since the food selections were displayed at the front of the bar but the beer selection wrapped all the way to the back of the bar and you couldn't see food and beer at the same time. Thankfully my obsessive research skills came in handy and I already knew what I wanted for dinner before we arrived. We split the Margarita flatbread, the cheese plate and the charcuterie plate. The flatbread came out fresh and hot and both the boards were beautifully laid out and everything we ate was delicious. 

The tap selection was decent and after splitting a flight we asked the bartender for a recommendation which he knowledgably provided. There were some local favorites as well as beers and breweries neither of us had heard of. It made for a nice mix. 

When we went to close out we were short on the $50 required to use the $25 off coupon I had purchased earlier in the day, so we ordered another round. To my amazement the bartender said he would take the coupon and just give us half off the total if we didn't reach that $50 mark. I am a big fan of using coupons and discounts and I had never encountered this generosity from an establishment."}
{"text":"Wonderful beer selection! Great outdoor space! I love that they do movies on Friday! And the price for a flight is fair - $11 for 5 beers. Jackie is a great bartender and is super sweet to customers. 

Only 4 stars because the last time I was there, I got yelled at by Brooke, one of the bartenders. I've never had a server/bartender be so rude to me :( I was hoping to get a soda. I realize now that they only offer Coke by the bottle, but really would have appreciated a nicer delivery."}
{"text":"Craft Tasting Room is one of my go-to spots for a relaxing beer after work or on the weekends. Great spot to meet up with friends or just enjoy a cold beer. The food menu is small but solid (you can go half/half on the cheese and charcuterie boards). Flights are a great deal and the beer is always rotating. They do movies on Fridays and occasionally have live music...and of course a wide selection of beers to go! Staff is very friendly and the place has nice indoor and outdoor seating. Each day had a different special, so don't forget to check that too!"}
{"text":"First timer at this place! Great spot for a date or going out with a group of friends.

Highlights:
-Extensive draft beer list 
-Wednesday is $6 charcuterie boards. I will be back for this!
-Awesome assortment of canned and bottled beer to take home
-Bottles and cans of wine available to purchase and take home or drink there 
-Soft pretzel is a great snack. It came out steaming hot so it seems like it was fresh and hadn't been sitting all day. 
-The mustard has some heat so if you have a low tolerance for heat, I would avoid it. I love spicy things so this mustard was perfect. I even looked up where I could buy it. 
-Bartenders were friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot to hit up when exploring breweries in South End. They have a lot of local beer on tap, and for purchase. Great (dog-friendly) patio area with picnic tables and fire pits! We ordered a charcuterie plate, and then ordered a cheese plate, because you have to have both! Was a good value for the money and rumor has it they do them for $6 on Wednesdays. So glad I finally checked this place out!"}
{"text":"If I'm going to go to a tasting room, then the only way to get me in there is to offer meat and cheese plates. Aside from the meat and cheese plates, there are flatbreads, pizzas and sandwiches to choose from on the menu. We shared a meat plate and a cheese plate at $9 each. Each came with two options plus toasts and toppings. Great place for a girls' lunch during the day. I tried a cider on draft and my friend had two pints of beer. Service was very pleasant and unobtrusive. I'd be more than happy to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Jen was a wonderful bartender. She helped me try beers I'd never find in Hawaii. Had a great time thanks to her."}
{"text":"I'm just super amazed that in this neighborhood there are actual options to hit after work. Long time Charlotte guy tweet but this neighborhood is moving from industrial to residential and it's awesome. 

Craft has a very large selection of regional beers with a couple of focus breweries on tap. It's got a large inside space good for a group and a patio too. I never got around to food because we were just here for a pre-dinner meetup but actually saw several people we knew who were here for an after work celebration and they were having an awesome time. 

There was a good Check this place out!"}
{"text":"When it's 65 degrees in February, that means it times to hit the patio and enjoy a drink under beautiful Carolina skies. 

We attempted to go to Sycamore yesterday, but it was bat ish crazy with people. We walked in and then walked right back out to the car. We weren't in the mood to deal with the crowds. I suggested we venture down the road to Craft.

I have been here before, but it was the first two for my two friends. They were skeptical when we parked. It only took five minutes of being inside to turn them into immediate fans. 

The beer selection is not only wide, it's filled with a lot of different and creative selections. There's craft beer here to satisfy anyone. I enjoyed a couple Noble Cider's Cherry Cider. 

The menu is perfect for a place like this. Flatbreads, piadina's (sandwiches with a few handcrafted ingredients), salads, cheese plates (with North Carolina cheeses), and charcuterie. The store portion of Craft doesn't have a huge selection, but it has some unique options. There are shelves of bottled beer options. 

The patio isn't huge, but it's simple and nice. As beautiful as it was yesterday, we actually opted to sit inside because we loved the vibe and feel. 

Craft is a much needed option for this neighborhood. This is a perfect spot to grab drinks with a friend, group of people or take a date. Cheers to Craft and congratulations on such a solid spot."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the selection of beers on tap - it was a good mix of local, regional, and national choices. I didn't peruse the bottle selection as extensively, but I saw good representation from various Carolina breweries and will definitely come back if I'm looking for something from a non-Charlotte brewery.

If I had to offer a suggestion, it would be nice to see the beers on tap organized by type. Because the menu is so extensive and wasn't organized at all, I found it frustrating to read and try to order. Also, I do wish there were more seating but I believe they're doing okay with the space they've got."}
{"text":"Craft is one of my favorite go-to places for a beer or a quick bite in South end! They have a great selection of beers on tap that are always changing and they are great about having selections from all the local breweries. 
Their food selection is on point! Highly recommend the charcuterie or cheese plates, and the flat bread pizzas are amazing - spend the extra money for the giant ball of burata on the pizza and you will not be disappointed! 
The outdoor space is great with a nice fire pit on those slightly more chilly evenings. Great place to come chill with friends."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, but what a fun little spot to walk to in Southend on a snowy day. Dogs are allowed. Variety of tap beers were offered, but they only offered one wheat, which was disappointing. Friendly staff. Very cozy feel."}
{"text":"Very very cool taproom with light food fare. Love the atmosphere and the selections are great. Crowd is typically a bit trendy and hip. Yet I always find it an easy place to hang and hydrate. They offer a real decent selection of bottles and cans to take home if and when needed which is also helpful. The interior is all hand worked wood and wrought iron, very cool for sure. Stop by and check them out, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in Charlotte to get bottles and growlers. The staff is great and they have an excellent selection.  I was there Saturday picking out a six pack and started to talk to one of the staff who was telling me there is new stuff not on the shelf yet. He continued to get it for me and ask if I want it.  He also went out of his way to give my son a snack who was hanging out playing a game while I shopped.  I also have eaten the food and it is fantastic."}
{"text":"I saw this craft room on the news and thought that it would be a great place to check out since my Hubs is starting to expand his pallet on craft beers.  With Christmas around the corner, we thought it would be a cool idea to send a little taste of NC to my hubs brother and wife who live in CO.  So off to Craft Tasting Room we go....

So easy to find.  Tucked in the heart of South end on the off of S. Tryon and Church street.  We walked in mid day on a Wed and the owner and another worker were very happy to help us.  Lots of local beers on tap.  Lots.  Along with a wide selection of bottled and canned beers from NC and GA.  Jams and Jellies from NC, SC and GA.  Perfect melting pot for my gift basket for the B and SIL.  

We ended up talking with the owner for a while and stayed and had a beer and a meat and cheese plate.  Local meats and cheese are also on the menu.  Such a great spot for a non pretentious night out with friends or your main squeeze. Or ...if you dare...a great spot to day drink without tons of folk judging you.  ha!  I can't wait to go back and already thought about having my bday here!!!  

OH and they also have a small selection of wine from CA.  No corking fee....you can buy the bottle and he'll open it for ya and you can enjoy while the beer drinkers enjoy their beers!  SCORE"}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it!! Heck of a bottle selection and amazing revolving taps! Nice in the summertime when they utilize the outside of the place. I live in Tega Cay but work in uptown. I go here often."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!!  The atmosphere is wonderful and the service was as good as it gets.  The staff is very friendly.  I came in on a weeknight and it was fairly crowded.  There was some open seating scattered around and no wait.  

I chose to do a flight and it was great.  I loved every one of my beers.  They have a unique selection of beers which is very exciting to see.  None of the old boring ones like some places have.  My absolute favorite was Sour Monkey!!  I took it home in a growler. 

They have some food items, which I was surprised about.  I noticed they have a meat platter and a cheese platter, but I wish it were combined.  I opted for a flatbread: goat cheese and artichoke hearts!  It was pretty delicious, but could've used a thick, sweet, balsamic drizzle-it would've been perfect!!  Turns out they used to have balsamic, but not anymore?  I didn't really catch the reason because I was too memorized with my luscious beer!

Dying to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I am just obsessing over my new city. Confession about myself I loveeee researching everything, meaning I research food spots, I research clothing stores, I research food I eat, the list goes on. If they have a bad yelp review rating I don't go(got my peeps who can vouch) lol yes it's that serious on these streets. So that means by me living in a new city where I know nothing. There goes my little fingers typing google.com. So apparently there's so many activities to do here in Charlotte & we don't have to drive forever to get there found this spot that offers movie screenings and oh my goodness guys it was just the cutest thing ever(peep my IG stories or snap to see). Got babes & I out the house to watch clueless haha it was his first time watching it let's just say he was in & out. I got me a @lennyboybrewingco mint condition kombucha & your girl was a happy camperIt was totally my scene.

This place has worn my heart & I will be going back to blog about it because we need those angles in a shoot. Last night was to dark to capture it all. But overall it was just an amazing night"}
{"text":"I am over the moon about Craft opening! I stopped in last night for their opening night and WOW was I impressed at the beautiful job they have done with this space! The best way to describe this place is Common Market and Good Bottle Co had a baby and she is perfect. 

Ambiance and Decor - The building is brick painted white, their great logo in black on the front and then market lights are over the biergarten with about 8 picnic tables. The look is fresh, clean and inviting, we all couldn't help but snap a photo. 

Once you enter you are greeted by a U-shaped bar with the first portion dedicated to their food menu, the main portion dedicated to their 36 beers on tap and seating wraps around the rest of the bar. 

Food - Since it was opening night we didn't get a chance to try their food and trust me, we were DYING to get a charcuterie platter. The menu is simple, charcuterie platters, flatbread sandwiches and flatbread pizza. They also have a deli display of local cheeses and meats from around NC which I can't wait to dive into. The flatbread sandwiches have savory and sweet options (I am pretty sure the Nutella with banana will be a huge hit). 

There is a grocery type section with a variety of local treats and I wanted to take each and every one of them home. I could see myself stopping in to pick up a growler and some treats for a great gift basket. 

Beer - There are 36 beers on tap and half of those are dedicated to local brews. You can enjoy your beers in the biergarten or inside at one of their wooden tables, there is plenty of room to sit! If you want to back beers up and take them home you can have growlers filled or select from their shelves of bottles ready to go. 

Bottom Line: You should check out Craft. They are a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and I can not wait to spend more time here (especially when the new wine and dessert spot opens up next door. Yes please!)"}
{"text":"Best craft beer spot in town. If you don't agree then you've never been to Craft. Roommates and I visit regularly. Flatbreads are also great."}
{"text":"I love Craft! This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte to come for a drink. They have a huge selection of craft beer to choose from. As a non-beer drinker, I appreciate that they always have was cider on tap. 

They have really good food as well. The piadinas and flatbreads are my favorite. The pretzel is also good and don't forget about the $6 meat and cheese board special on Wednesdays!

The patio is one of my favorites on a nice day. The indoor space is also nice, but it can get pretty loud when it starts to get crowded. 

If you're looking for specialty beer, you can't miss their large bottle collection as well. 

This is definitely one of my top happy hour locations and worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Craft is my go to spot in Charlotte for food and beer. There are a ton of places to drink in this neighborhood, but we almost always end up at craft b/c they have food- what a novel concept! And it's good food at that! I also love that they have flights. I often opt for this b/c they have so many options. They just increased the size of the flight and the price, which I am not a huge fan of, but I will still order them. The atmosphere is my favorite. We are more into the chill vibe than the packed out vibe, so we end up here a lot. We can also walk to it from my place, which makes us regulars.

The food consists of cheese and charcuterie plates, local loaf pretzels and mustard, flat breads, and piadina (sandwiches). The menu is very simple, but great, especially to accompany a beer. Like I said, the food is what keeps us coming back because it is available and better than other options around. Patio is fun in winter with the fire pit as well.

People are discovering this place, and I don't like it."}
{"text":"So what do you do when Unknown closes at 10? You come around back to Craft, of course. Seems like a lot of people had the same thought that we did though, the place is hoppin' (see what I did there? Because hops? ....get it? it's funny, I promise). 

The first thing you notice is the huge wall of drafts, followed by the absurd amount of bottles that Craft has to offer. 
The draft wall was identified by a chalkboard above it, saying the name of the beer, the ABV, and maybe something else... it would've been nice if it were a bit more organized by style or something else, as I was looking all over the place to find which beer I wanted to try out.
My best friend and I got the five glass flight of a few local darker beers that we were interested in trying. You get to write your choices on a tag and they're poured in the order you specify. 
Finding a table took a little bit of time, but was relatively painless. Music was angsty girl rock. Nice. 

During the warmer months, they project movies on a screen painted on the window, so I'm looking forward to coming here and hanging out then!

Overall, although busy and a bit unorganized, Craft is a cool hangout and I'm absolutely inclined to come here again!"}
{"text":"So many beers (a lot local) to choose from! Get a $9 flight and a meat or cheese plate, perfect for happy hour or a Saturday afternoon hang out. Can't wait to go back and sit on the patio in warmer weather."}
{"text":"Craft is one of my favorite spots in Charlotte to grab a beer. They are not a brewery - but they have a bunch of different beers on tap that rotate!

Deal of the Day: Go on Mondays and the flights are $6! This is a great deal and allows you to try 5 beers

Surprise: They actually serve elevated bar food! Flatbread pizzas, sandwiches, and cheese boards

Not so Good news: Yelp shows the wrong closing times for mid-week. I was there on a Tuesday and they close at 10 not 11. The Bartender basically threw us out at 1030 even though we still had beers to finish."}
{"text":"A good hangout spot on the South End. The beers were good, and the atmosphere was fantastic. It's small, but there was still plenty of room for everyone inside. We ordered a flight of 5 different beers- we liked some, we didn't like others, but we definitely learned what to order for when we come next!"}
{"text":"Although I am not a huge craft beer drinking, I have good friends who have always made great selections, due to the fact there are plenty, for me.
I love the atmosphere, an inside bar with tables throughout and a great patio, to enjoy on a great afternoon and night....and, they are dog friendly.
In addition to the beer, they offer a small menu.  I have enjoyed the cheese platter and a few pizzas, all great! -"}
{"text":"This is a nice, spacious brewpub with some very tasty choices. Plenty of people-watching and sights to behold. Staff were very friendly and helpful...when you could grab their attention. That was my one complaint - very busy place, but servers would glide past you without a thought, even if you clearly asked them a question. Not rude - just, busy. But the food was delish and I had a blast going. Also loved that it opened out to the front and let dogs sit around. Great mix of casual and upscale."}
{"text":"Check this place out if you haven't been yet. It looks small from the outside but don't be deceived... It's very spacious inside with a large bar, tables and even an outside patio with shade!  

A very large beer selection for sure with tons of IPA choices for you who also enjoy a good IPA. Lots of brews you haven't heard of either. (salt beer?!). With so many choices you can get a draft flight of 5 beers for $9. It comes on this beautiful wooden carrier. 

The staff is very friendly and will offer to help you narrow down the selection to find ones that you will like. The decor inside is very clean and rustic.  Think exposed brick and Edison light bulbs.

Oh and Yelp. On my way out I noticed BIKE PARKING!  I always see that question when I check in and usually can't answer since I didn't look for it initially. There is a small stand out front that is bolted to the ground."}
{"text":"Great spot to try a wide variety of beer with some great bartender suggestions. Great tapas style food as well."}
{"text":"We did a girls night at Craft on a Wednesday to take advantage of the $6 charcuterie and cheese plates. The food was awesome--great bang for your buck. The trays were big with great products being served. We did also order a flatbread which was super tasty. It was the perfect set up for talking and grabbing bites throughout the night. 

They have a HUGE selection of bottled beers, wine and draft beers. It is the kind of place where everyone can find something to sip on and be happy. 

My only complaint was that the beers were written in chalk on the board and it was pretty tough to read the way the light hit the board with all the chalk dust--plus it was busy enough that we couldn't get right up to the bar. When I asked if there was a list I could look at with beers the woman behind the bar pointed to the wall. So that was a little disappointing. She was unable to help me find one that was similar to what I was looking for, a Saison, but there were a couple of customers at the bar who were more than helpful in offering suggestions to other options."}
{"text":"Good stuff!

The atmosphere is awesome - theres a bar, a patio, small bites for food and a small shop pantry feel - similar to common market, but much more room!"}
{"text":"Came across Craft by accident. Went on a Friday evening for the food truck festival at the Unknown brewery. When we checked in, the guy at Unknown told us we could go next door to the Craft taste room if we wanted. That sparked my curiosity and I wondered why a brewery would recommend another brewery. Well after going down the alley I was at Craft's parking lot. The outside patio was filled with people. So we decided to go in and take a look. 
Ended up staying at Craft for the rest of the evening. 
What a nice concept! A place that serves all types of craft beer. Pretty cool. So my hubby ordered a flight of amazing beers. The ones that stood out to me as stellar were Mother Earth Overhead and Lost Coast Apricot Wheat. At $11 a flight with each glass holding about 7oz, I thought this was an awesome deal!
In regards to the snacks, Craft offers perfect beer accompaniments. One in my party ordered a flatbread with a huge ball of fresh burrata. Which I would describe as a mix of fresh mozzarella with a buttery cream inside. OMG!!!  
Nice vibe, huge variety on tap, good snack foods.  Will def be returning."}
{"text":"Had a good time - great craft beer selection and also good finger food. We had flat bread, it was tasty and worth the price"}
{"text":"My last  adventure was to the \"Craft Tasting Room\". This is just outside of downtown, behind the Unknown Brewery. It's a small place, with probably 30 to 40 craft beers on tap. Stuff from all over. They also have a killer flatbread pizza, and a good fruit/cheese tray. Good place to go, taste lots of different beers, and eat. My wife and I split 2 different flights. I had a watermelon beer, a strawberry beer, several different IPAs, a cherry cider, a Black ale, etc. Too many to give a review on. Most were good. Staff very friendly. We lucked out and got a seat at the bar. They have tables inside and outside. Parking is on the street, but plenty of spots."}
{"text":"On Friday nights around 8:30 pm they play a movie outside. It's projected on a brick wall. They played Talledega  nights and in my opinion they began the movie prematurely because it wasn't dark enough to see. Also it wasn't really loud enough either. But a cool summer night experience. Bring a blanket or lawn chairs and come early to get a spot. Dogs welcome"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem of South End. It's off the beaten path, but well worth the walk through the more industrial parts of the neighborhood.  

The atmosphere is great with a nice mix of people. You'll see families rubbing elbows with hipsters and no one minds. The beer selection will make everyone happy while the tasty food keeps you sober enough to keep drinking.

The pretzel bun is my hands down favorite, paired with one of Lusty Monk's delicious mustards (which they sell in jars as well) it's a must have every time I'm there.

They can get a bit overwhelmed when the place is hopping, so prepare to be patient on busier nights. Otherwise, this place is a fantastic addition to the South End beer scene."}
{"text":"In a clear sign of destiny and good fate, this place was directly across the street from our Airbnb in Charlotte.  Mere minutes after our group had arrived we sent a scouting party to Craft to get a lay of the land and return with the essentials.  

We were not disappointed.  The place is bigger on the inside than it may appear on the outside with a good size bar and plenty of seating.  Craft beer is EVERYWHERE in bottles and on tap.  We had three growlers filled and I particularly enjoyed the Blue Blaze hefe.  The charcuterie platters that were on many of the tables looked tasty.

Very cool spot and worth a visit if you're in the area."}
