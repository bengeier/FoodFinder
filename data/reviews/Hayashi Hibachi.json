{"text":"We came here for dinner and had the Shrimp Tempura which was horrible. We sat in the dining section and the atmosphere is very nice but our meal for 18 Dollars was very lacking in quality and flavor!  We told the server and he made no effort to correct the situation so we will not be back!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit. First was when they first opened, so by now I'd think the kinks would be worked out. Not so much! The service was terrible and we waited about 45 minutes for food. It was lunch time, not too crowded but the server kept telling everyone how \"slammed\" she was. Meanwhile there were plenty of staff standing around. I would think they could lend a hand if she was so \"slammed\". You couldn't help but hear all the orders that were messed up and wrong food brought to the wrong table. Once we finally got our food, I must say it was really good. I would have given more stars if the service and timing of receiving the food were better. Overall, great food, average to small portions, nice ambiance but avoid if you are on a timed lunch or starving."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for a sushi date last night and we have never been so uncomfortable and disgusted at a restaurant. To start the hostess was so unprofessional and told us that all the tables were \"like full\" and kept saying \"like\". She asked us if we wanted to go check for ourselves, I asked is it self seating and she stated that there are tables for 2 but that we wouldn't want that. We both went and glanced around the corner and there were 4 open tables. Finally after being seated at a booth we realized the atmosphere of over served drunks. The couples next to us were slamming drinks and obnoxiously cussing, and yes there were children right by them listening to every word. I ordered a cocktail and my husband just had a water, the server asked him rudely \"you're not gonna order alcohol?\"....Finally our drinks came and the glasses were obviously not washed with fingerprints and left over food particles on them-our appetites were ruined. We ordered a vegas roll but it might as well have been a cream cheese puff because all it was was deep fried cream cheese. Needless to say this was the worst experience we have ever had dinning out and we will definitely not be returning. HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. The place smells old carpet but has nice soothing decor. Not kids friendly menu though & the waiter told me they do not have spoons for the kids. He gave me a gigantic bent up spoon instead."}
{"text":"I haven't sat in the eat in dinner but I always sit in teppanyaki (grill side) very expensive but worth it in special occasion. It's a blast to watch the show they put on.  They live to entertain and the steak is amazing. Absolutely delicious. It quiets down after they are done cooking so it's a nice place to talk to a significant other."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in goodyear. I prefer their sushi over anywhere else. The wait staff is nice. The hostesses are a little unprofessional  but then again they are about 17 years old. Best fresh hot food."}
{"text":"Probably the best place in Avondale to hang out and put down some sake bombs. 

It's honestly not the best sushi in town but with happy hour pretty much everyday and all day you can't complain. The gyoza is always my go to item on the menu. 

My service experience here has always been positive. The hibachi is nothing special, all the same tricks and jokes and the food they cook is good."}
{"text":"The food is great, and always has been. But this time in particular, I ordered takeout (I usually dine-in). The customer service over the phone was awful! I was on hold for entirely too long for a restaurant that's not very busy during the lunch hour. Once I got there, I had to stand and wait to be served for almost 5 minutes! So I decided I would call them as I was standing there and just kind of wave my hand as to say \"Hello! You have a customer standing here!\" After that, the server came over, brought me my order and I paid cash. When the server came back with my change, the amount of change he gave me was off by almost $1. Now usually I tip, and I tip very well! But for this lack luster service? Not gonna happen! So I just took my change and left! Now I will go back and dine-in because the food is delicious and would get maybe 4 or 5 stars. But the takeout service was awful! You guys really need to do better!"}
{"text":"Well...I wouldn't get the dragon lady roll again but the shumai were good, and the rainbow roll was good.  Too many mayo/cream cheese rolls on that menu. Not even busy on a Sunday night with the BCS game in town.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This review was for Friday 03/10/2017 during the lunch period. 
We were first timers and did not even get to make a review on the food based on the poor customer service. 
1) The host/server told us to \"Come here!\" when he was ready to serve us. 
2) He sat us and was back within minutes to check if our order was ready. We ordered drinks and I asked (as is the norm)for a water with a small plate of lemon wedges-he acknowledged. 
3)He arrived with the drinks, no lemon wedges-asked a second time. He acknowledged and returned to take our order. When my wife asked him to clarify what some items were, the server was frustrated and annoyed. Once again, I asked for lemon wedges to drink that horrible water ( it is NOT filtered). He looked at me, and acknowledged. 
4) The server passed by our table many times. To no avail, no lemon wedges. We ordered and watched our server walk by a few more times. THAT'S THAT- we were unable to complete the meal. If customer service is bad, this, to me, conveys that they have no interest in other areas of service.
In good faith, we asked for a particular service item and he acknowledged many times. Maybe there was a language barrier. 
We inevitably went to another smokin' restaurant that served tempura and sushi at Westgate. Of which, in all fairness, won't mention."}
{"text":"We went with a group of friends to the hibachi tables. The food was good, I had the steak and shrimp. Was it the best meal I have ever had no, but it was good and the place is a lot of fun."}
{"text":"First let me just say the Hyashi in Surprise is one of my favorite places to go.  Now saying that my wife and i went last night  for New Years eve dinner to the Litchfield  and McDowell  restaurant  almost left before we ever ordered. Tables were sticky. Floors were  filthy and the booths were falling apart.  If this was my restaurant I would be embarrassed.  Why should people even trust what comes out of the kitchen.  Everything on the menu, which also looked like it came straight from a greasy  spoon dinner (the menu), was more expensive than the suprise restaurant.  And didnt even have the same selection.  And was told when asked about ordering what we liked from other place \" Its impossible \".  Now server was great. Forgot his name but he had only been there for 2 weeks and the food we settled for was bad, not great though.  It's a shame but we won't be  returning.  My advice to the owner. Close it or fix it, there is no shame if its not working for you to closing but there's no honor in keeping it open in its current conditions."}
{"text":"This is my new addiction! Took some friends and family here to celebrate my mom's birthday, it was her first time and she had a blast. 

Our first chef Poncho isn't at this location any more which we were disappointed about but ended up having another great chef named Sam. He was funny and the food was great! I tried grilled shrimp for the first time and I am a fan. 

Our waitress was awesome! On top of everything, funny and she told us Sam was the head chef and that it was an honor to have him cook our food and that she was so glad we got him, seeing that it was the first time for almost everyone in our group to try a place like this.

We have also had dinner on the patio when it was cooler out and enjoyed it too. I will be eating here often.

Thanks Hayashi for always making my dining experience fun and delicious"}
{"text":"This review is for the non-grill side only.  Co-workers have praised the grill side of the restaurant. 

We just moved to goodyear and are looking for go-to restaurants. This will definitely not be one of them. 

We ordered two sushi rolls, one of them being my favorite hamachi.  It was okay but the fish was clearly not fresh or of quality. It was lacking in flavor and texture.

The restaurant dropped from a 2/3 to a one star when we got our next dish, tuna tataki. Not only was the fish not fresh, but it was actually \"off.\" I sent a dish back for only the second time in my life. I left feeling nauseous and still can become so when I think about that fish. 

The decor was expected and run-down. They had plain 8.5x11 pieces of white paper taped at every table to advertise.  You would think they could have at least added clip art or a border to add some design or color. 

Overall, the place feels like a poorly run, has-been kind of place. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I'm not sure what happened but every single time I've gone it's proceeded to get worse and worse. 

I invited my friend from across town tonight to experience his first hibachi and I'm almost embarrassed. 1st off, management has this place very understaffed. Almost all the grills were going and they had two servers to serve the entire place. The poor waiters were running around with their heads cut off. It wasn't their fault for the issue but because of the issue the service was TERRIBLE.

1) Our salads were brought out about 20 minutes after ordering and they didn't bring enough for our table. He apologized and ran back to the kitchen but got side tracked serving every other table that the salad was forgotten about. 

2) Our soup came out when the chef was cooking. The waiter couldn't keep up, not by his fault. 

3) Our drinks weren't filled. He didn't have time. 

4) Our chef was speaking Spanish almost the whole time he was cooking to the Spanish speaking group at our table. I love myself a group of Spanish speaking people but when I'm paying $22+ plus for my \"show\" and dinner I'd like to know what's being discussed...

5) Our check came about 30 mins AFTER we were all finished. My group and the other group literally sat there looking at each other and looking around for our waiter that was slammed with other tables. Then you sat waiting for another 10 minutes for him to come back and get our cards to run them.

6) 18% gratuity was automatically put on BOTH groups check. I had a group of 4. They had a group of 5. I'm sorry. The service was horrible. The food was mediocre. The poor waiter totally didn't deserve a $20 tip and that wasn't his fault at all. Since when did a party of 4 start getting billed for service too? SUPER TACKY!

7) When you walk in there's giant signs posted everywhere about how they longer take gift cards and refuse to take some coupons or something. It screamed unfriendly, cold, and you're about to get charged a ton of money for a bad experience but we don't get a crap... NO DISCOUNTS! 

8) My 12 year old twins were told they were too big to order off the children's menu so their dinner was $10 more each. The menu says 12 and under. Do I need to start bringing birth certificates with me to prove my age when I order steak and shrimp?

This was probably our 10th time attending and will be my last. Just avoid the place at all costs. You're better off running to Panda for some fried rice and orange chicken down the street, or better yet.. grab a burger from Freddy's in the same parking lot. Save your $150 and run into Best Buy next door and buy yourself something worthwhile. They clearly don't care about the reviews being left here either. It really says a lot and I wish I had read these before I came home so angry that I had to take the time to warn others."}
{"text":"Solid job on the large sushi roll I had, same for bacon-wrapped shrimp and asparagus appetizer. Friendly bartender helped me sort through the menu and made a tasty Long Island. Owner stopped by twice to say hi. The menu is pretty cryptic...very  little information given. Web site also shows an entirely different menu than the one you get in person."}
{"text":"so far so good...it s not a busy place! samurai drink is pretty good.. oh, and the cucumber margaritas cheers!"}
{"text":"This is a new Japanese steak house that just opened. I liked the furnishings inside and the tile logo behind the sushi bar was very cool looking. I ordered a medium rare steak and my girl ordered chicken tempura, we both were extremely pleased, steak is how I grade restaurants and my steak was cooked correctly and meat was of good quality with a very nice sake list, so good rating from me.  My girl's tempura was good also cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight for the first time. Excellent food and service! We both had the filet mignon on the hibachi and it was superb! So tender! The service was great. Our drinks never got low. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"No one cares at this place!  You would think the Hibachi chefs would care a little more about cooking your food (after all don't they have to spend some time learning all those fancy skills?!)  Anyway our last experience there was terrible.  The guy just wanted to go home - the only trick he did was the onion volcano and it was so disappointing as we had guests and our young kids there.  Oh also if you go make sure to ask for shrimp - as the server explained to us you only get shrimp included with your meal if the chef feels like including it.  All other times it has been included but apparently it's up to the chef because that makes sense."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite sushi restaurant based on price and quality. However tonight, again, I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and I sat for over 15 minutes watching people get DRINK orders before I could even order a water. What a joke. If you read and review it should be this one. Bypass them if you want service if you are a regular American and not some super model. They will blow you off. King the chef is great but his talents are being wasted with these new joke owners.  For more info I'll even answer any questions via phone or text. Please hit me up."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere too ... Kids love the grill and the the fellas who cook and keep you laughing are great ... I have been there atleast 4 times and plan on returning ... JL"}
{"text":"Food was average, but the cooks, host, and waitstaff do not care about patrons having a positive experience.  The \"show\" put on by our chef was basically non-existant compared to other similar restaurants in the area we have been to - the chef also did not offer any sauces and we had to ask for sauces as he was wheeling the cart away after finishing cooking - I LOVE the sauces at Hibachi and this was disappointing.  Food portions were much smaller than other Hibachi restaurants - waitstaff was not very welcoming or kind.  Very disappointed!  :("}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this sushi restaurant with my sister and her fiancé. First of all, I know this is weird...I love sushi, but I like the fish cooked just a little, sounds dumb, but that's how I like it. Anyway I asked if I could have my salmon slightly cooked and he responded with \"well the point of sushi is having the fish raw\" after I insisted, he went and asked the kitchen. He came back and said \"our cook says we can do that, but we don't want to.\" Really? What great customer service. I then asked if I could speak to a manager and he responded with \"he is busy, so he can't.\" Needless to say, we walked out of there and took our business elsewhere. Terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Disappointing.

No host to seat us, so we eventually found someone at the bar to help. No seating near the chefs preparing the food, so missed out on the 'hibachi' experience.

The tempura appetizers were done very well, and our server was very sweet and attentive.
Unfortunately the main meal (steak, shrimp and chicken with rice and vegetables) was absolutely abysmal.
Everything - absolutely everything - was completely saturated in soy and sodium. The rice, the chicken, steak, vegetables... everything. Further to this, most of the plate was also saturated in grease. About a third of the way in we just gave up on our meals.

For the prices charged, I was expecting something a lot more authentic. The preparation felt amateurish (along with the 'sauces' offered) and the check at the end of the meal felt like a kick in the gut for what we had received.

After we settled our bill and tipped the (excellent) server, we passed a hostess on the way out who could not be bothered to look away from her screen to acknowledge or thank us for visiting.
I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"After King and Jason left.  The quality has gone from good to more than worse.  Service has super slow.  Servers seem as though they are serving time and not happy to be there.  The owners need to return back to quality and hire happier staff"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, the service is pretty decent.  They ruin the atmosphere by playing crappy pop music instead of traditional Japanese. They had the volume high enough that it was difficult to have a conversation. Same thing both times I was here."}
{"text":"This was great!! The chef prepares the meal right in front of you. The performance we had was awesome!  The food was delicious too. My filet was very tender and flavorful. We were there on a double date and it was a fantastic time had by all. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Dirty, over-priced, and the food is mediocre at best. The bathrooms were disgusting, the table was sticky and who knows what the kitchen looked like. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Hostess was ridiculously rude but our server Ashley was super great! Food was decent, spider roll was good. Probably won't go back but worth it to try once."}
{"text":"Went twice for dinner and our server Amy was rude and pushy. The owner also was extremely pushy and was like are we ready to order and isn't as polite. We got to a table and the plate had teriyaki sauce on it and we asked for another one and after they brought out our drinks, we had to ask again. Then the rolls also took a long time to come out. The rolls were cold by the time we got them. Wouldn't recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! The guy bartender sucks and ignores customers but the girl on Wednesdays is awesome, Michelle. It's a little hole in the wall place with cheap drinks, a long happy hour, and tasty sushi. We go quite often and have discovered the only way to get good service is to either have the nice blonde lady who wears a tie and serves or the bartender Michelle. The other waiters get way too flustered when it isn't even busy. If you're looking for a new spot try this place out! If the decor was not so tacky (and paper taped up to the wall throughout the restaurant??) it'd get 5 stars from me and my husband. We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Good was great, horrible service and place was dirty. Bathroom had no paper towels and toilet was clogged, trash all over floors in dinning area and vinyl on booths needs to be replaced due to shredding. Won't be returning;("}
{"text":"My kids wanted to rate this a 5, but this is the  first Japanese place they have been to.  The waitress was a shrew, and I never rate on service - just food.  Everyone else liked their food but they screwed up mine."}
{"text":"Best happy hour on the west side. My wife and i love this place.

Can't beat domestic draft $1.50 and $4-5 rolls during happy hour. Don't forget $5 sake bomber. This is the place to go if you want to get smashed and eat great food."}
{"text":"This place could use some serious work. My boyfriend and I came in at 9pm on a Tuesday. As we walked in there was another couple in front of us waiting to be seated. There was no host in the front but a man in the back room placing napkins on a table. He literally looked at us for several minutes without any acknowledgment. Finally he sat the people in front of us and then proceeded to seat my boyfriend and I at a CLEARLY dirty table. Our waitress came over promptly and wiped it down. The woman we had was nice enough but the only part that bothered me is she brought my boyfriends sushi out before mine and didn't bring mine until at least 5 minutes after his had been dropped. In terms of food, they had a nice choice of speciality rolls but their happy hour menu is a joke. Finally, in my opinion I feel like sushi should be served cold (I mean it's raw fish??!!) but when we started eating we noticed that our sushi was oddly room temperature aside from the Firecracker Roll served deep fried. It was VERY off putting and we couldn't eat much because it was just gross all warm. Coming from someone who works in the restaurant industry and after reading other reviews, it sounds like this restaurant has a lot of the same problems over and over. How hard is it to acknowledge customers as they walk in and not sit guests at a dirty table? $40 we wasted on this sad experience. I don't think you could pay me to eat there again."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Had great customer service. Downside there was a hair in the eggrolls. We notified the server and they were quick to offer a refund or give us a whole new order for free. Handled it very friendly."}
{"text":"Best In The West! Ask for the Cowboy Roll. Sit at the bar. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Super cheap but everything is quality. Happy hour is like all day and the bartender makes the drinks really good. Rolls are great and the music isn't bad. Last time I spent $50 and me and my girlfriend were full and drunk. She left her sunglasses and they kept them for a week and just brought them to her! Shes super happy. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Never eating here again, I should of notice the ratings. I got food poisoning from one of the rolls. And I think it might of been the Tuna!"}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times over the years and the food is usually pretty good. But tonight, the service was really poor. Food was slow to be delivered, had to ask multiple times for a bowl of rice, and waitress was too busy cleaning a table to bring me our bill, after I had asked for it!  There are enough other options in the area that we'll spend our money elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place while on my way back in from San Diego a couple weeks ago. We were still 45 mins out from home & everyone was starving so we stopped off I-10 & Litchfield Rd to get something to eat. We didn't know what to expect, but my wife, kids & I all love sushi so we gave it a go.

The 1st pleasant surprise was that it was Happy Hour from 3pm-Close on Sunday (the day we were there) and there were many great drink & food specials on the Happy Hour menu, which we ordered everything from.

The next pleasant surprise was that the sushi piece and serving sizes were generously LARGE. We left full, happy and impressed. I wish we lived closer to this place. If we did, we'd be regulars. Enjoy it if you're in the area, or make a plan to seek it out. If your experience was anything like ours, you'll be very pleased."}
{"text":"Great service all around!!! Not sure if it was the owner or manager but we were greeted with a warm welcome and a handshake as soon as we arrived and seated immediately. Cook was wonderful and great with the children at the table . Food was perfect! At the end of the meal the owner came back and checked on us and how the food was. Great will return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed. I went on a Saturday night. Not crowded but a good amount inside to make me believe this place might be decent. I just moved from Mesa to this side of the valley so I didn't want to drive 30 mins to go to my usual sushi spots. Won't make that mistake again. The sushi was extremely bland and service was slow... I sat at the bar."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner the other night. When we walked in the place smelled like dirty steamy dishes! We waited at the hostess stand behind another couple who were placing a to go order. The hostess not once acknowledged that we were standing there. Needless to say already unimpressed and I said exactly that to my husband as an employee walked by. 
The employee turned out to be our waiter. As he seated us I noticed a tired dirty restaurant. At our table the lacquered wall was covered in spattered  something (food?) And smeared stuff.
I was afraid to touch anything. The waiter saw and probably heard how disgusted I was and could not have been anymore attentive. The food was mediocre. I don't even remember what I had I couldn't wait to get out of  there!
So kudos to the great waiter with the awesome beard. You are the only reason for the 2 stars! 
I don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. If one describes this place. Wow. We had great service and were seated fairly quick for a Friday night. Food was amazing! I love the sushi here as well as the sake bombs!! They are the bomb! Keep it up guys. Will always recommend Hayashi as one of my go to sushi spots in the LP area. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this was possibly the best sushi experience I've had in the Phoenix area. It was incredibly fresh and just plain tasty! The menu is large and we were glad to be sitting near people who were just receiving their food, because the food looks 1000x better than it is pictured on their menu! The prices are pretty average for a Japanese/sushi house.  We will definitely return. I am excited to sit around the area where they cook in front of you (I've completely blanket on what that is called). Anyway, we really enjoyed our time there and hope to make this our \"go-to\" sushi place."}
{"text":"Food was great! BIG portions. You must try the Firecracker Roll."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!! First, we weren't greeted when we were seated. She didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, we had to ask her if we can get waters. I ordered a sushi roll without meat (I am vegan) and asked for extra cucumbers since I am not getting meat. She said it would cost extra. I then asked another server and said no it's not an extra cost. My roll gets to the table and it only has avocado no cucumbers. They also placed my roll into my friends plate. As she was walking away with my roll and my friends, we asked for the plate back so we can place my friends roll in another plate so she can eat yours as I wait for mine. Took forever to get refills on our drinks. We then asked for 3 taryaki sauces and she brought two. I asked if we can get one more and she said we already gave you two. I asked if I can get one more since three people wanted the sauce. Not to mention prices were pretty expensive. A plate with chicken, soup, and veggies was $20.00. When it was time to pay we noticed tip of 18% was already applied to our bill. We asked to speak to a manager. Another server comes and asked what's going on. As I was going to start to explain she cuts me off hands me new receipts and says I took off the tip. I said okay thanks and showed no interest in what I had to say and walked away. They don't have a good kids menu at all either, FYI. Never coming back here."}
{"text":"I would give this a five star but unfortunately they have a floor manager or something who always seem like he is watching me and my friends. We have been coming here for years pay almost 100 Everytime I am here. We have a good time with staff and it's good food. This manager has followed us to the bathroom outside. It's like he is always folowing us. If he wasn't here this place would be 100 percent the best place in town."}
{"text":"Terrible experience and we will never be back. We decided that we would go to this place because we love the one that is located in Surprise.  We don't go too often because it is a little pricey and we believe it should be for somewhat special occasions or once in a blue moon.  We should have known to turn around as soon as we walked in and saw the sign that said \"we no longer accept hyashi gift cards at this location\" written all sloppy in black sharpie. We were seated with a group of 5 already waiting at the grill table.  Another red flag that we should have turned around was the arrangement of plastic plates (burn marks and old crusted food included), mismatched chairs at all of the tables, and misspelled menus that were typed up on a computer.  It seems to me that a place that charges 25 big ones for one meal would at least have some real dishes.  Not long after we were seated we began noticing how unnecessarily cold it was in the place....and then the wait to place our orders. Finally our chef comes out and starts cooking for us.  He was a quiet guy who didn't do any of the fancy tricks or make any jokes like most do, but whatever...and then it happened..the grill went out....3 times, but he kept cooking. All of our food was undercooked.  I took a couple of bites and was done. The food was so bland! The rice was hard, the broccoli was raw, and he actually took the chicken to the back to finish cooking it. By this point, we were so \"hangry\" and frustrated that we had to wait so long for the grill to keep reheating and the with undercooked food we decided we were just going to ask for a box and the check and take it home so we could cook it so it was actually edible. We thought that with all of the difficulties we had we would get a little discount or compensated in some way, nope..$54 for 2 meals and 2 waters.  Seriously, don't waste was your time or money."}
{"text":"We stared off the evening super excited. We ended up getting a group of 11 of friends/coworkers to come to celebrate 4 birthdays that had happened in the past week. We made a reservation for all of us, 8pm on a Friday night.

First it took us and extra 10 min to get seated.. not terrible. About 5 minutes later we meet our server and order drinks, all a water, some got an alcoholic drink. From there it went downhill. 45 min later we finally all got our waters. Another 15 min to get alcoholic drinks. No food had showed up by 9:10. As we got our soup around 9:15, we asked our waiter if the food was going to come out soon. Cesar replies, \"I hope so. I have no idea....\" Great.

Luckily the chef came out within 5 minutes and the rest of our experience was nice. The food had good flavors, the chef was nice and did all the tricks. 4.5 stars go to this chef! 

Because of the service tonight unfortunately none of us will be coming back or recommending."}
{"text":"Amazing time great food and great customer service got the mango shrimp it was to die for it was amazing"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi spot! We love the chef king! There's so many great rolls it's hard to decide what to eat! Kids love it too!"}
{"text":"This place makes you come into the restaurant to place a to go order. I came in, waited for 10 minutes for some guy wearing a tom Clancy t shirt to come up to the front. It was apparent he had no idea about the menu. I asked for extra pink sauce and he mumbled something to himself, I tried to explain what I meant and he told me that he would figure it out. This dude was either stoned to the bone or brand new although I don't think it was the latter. The teppanyaki here is good. Otherwise I would never put up with this kind of service.  I can't speak about the sushi as I haven't had it.  Bar tender is a good dude, chefs do a good job. 

Edit: So I wrote that review while I waited on my order. Steak is wayyy over cooked (I ordered rare) it came medium well. Meal came with 3 shrimp. My extra pink sauce came, it was only one container.  The stoner idiot host brought my my to go containers in a plastic bag sideways so everything spilled!!!! Ughhhhh what a moron!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a couple of times and all times it sucked. I sat at the bar and when I tried to ask them about the sushi on the menu, they weren't sure what was what seeing as how the menu mixes everything and doesn't have whether it's baked or raw. And when I did get my miso soup it tasted awful and was cold. The sushi wasn't even that fresh either. Made me sick."}
{"text":"Need to sit at the bar to receive happy hour specials. Rolls are small and priced high.  Haven't tried other items on the menu but I won't be going back to this place for sushi."}
{"text":"I am reluctant to post a review after only trying this place once. However, the grill cook gave away my shrimp and that is a no no. At first I noticed him asking a kid next to us \"You want to try some shrimp and gave him a few pieces. Then his brother asked for some and he gave him some then the Mom said yumm so, he gave her some. I started thinking maybe they ordered shrimp too, but why would he give them so little. So after we all were served only two of us actually ordered shrimp. Me and my guest! I was gypped on my $22 plate of shrimp that came with less than 10 pieces and I had seen others plates with mounds. I would have liked to sample the Dad's scallops or maybe their chicken or how about the Mom's lobster. Not cool. The food wasn't even flavorful, nothing, not the New York Strip, rice, or veggies. I don't think I would ever go back even though it was a pretty nice show at the teppanyaki grill."}
{"text":"I wasn't gonna write a review but it keeps reminding me to write a review since I checked in.I like to use Yelp for positive reviews but I just can't give this place 2 stars let alone 1 star. This was our 2nd time in. I swore the first time I would never go back. Dirty tables all around. We got sat right in the middle of them all sat through our whole meal next to dirty tables with piled high plates everywhere. 2nd visit we got invited by some family for lunch we get there  a few tables dining not many. Server was alright got our drinks fast but the wait for food on a slow day was way to long almost 50 mintues for lunch. My lunch was such a disappointment I got the lunch chicken teriyaki  box but it should have been called the raw onion box with a garnish of 2 nugget pieces of chicken.It was all onions raw onions not even grilled. The only thing good on my plate was the salda and the orange. Rice was sticky and hard at the same time. Our server never checked backed with us because he already knew he was getting %18 tip because we had 6 people in our party. 3 adults 3 kids. Drinks went empty. 65 bucks later completely disappointed and left hungry.  We will not return. Go to pei wei and get better service and food for half the price. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Food mediocre, our server Amy was rude she must be having a bad day or something because she didn't seem to care about us at all. When I went to use the restroom I saw some chef telling a customer they needed to leave when they were just talking to the sushi chef. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Food was good as usual. 

We were seated at a table in dining room facing the sushi bar. A few disturbing things.  1) I watched a sushi chef eating while behind his station (a health code no-no) not to mention didn't see him wash his hands before he worked on order after eating.  2) the ladies restroom was TRASHED 3) there was a large table in dining room that were behaving as if they were in a nightclub.  Chanting for shots etc."}
{"text":"our family has eaten here frequently (on the grill side).
this evening we chose to sit on the table side, for the first time---NEVER AGAIN!!
son ordered shrimp (cane out over cooked)
daughter ordered steak, medium (came out well done)
my husband ordered kobe beef, medium (mind you, this is a $65 meal--came out WELL DONE).
we are \"regulars\" the staff knows us, and knows that we have never complained about our food---when we did complain this evening, the \"manager\" on duty even stated that we have never complained.
all in all, we ended up paying for all of the terrible meals---however, they have us a whopping $20 gift certificate for a future visit.....
needless to say, we were very disappointed to know that regular, repeat business is only worth $20 to them"}
{"text":"Let me first say, the environment was great, the staff was cordial, and the food decent.  I'm giving only 2 stars for, quite frankly, one main reason: the food took a very long time to make.  Our entire dinner took 2 hours and the first hour was waiting for the food.  The place was busy but not filled so quite frankly, there should be no reason for this inconvenience.  I will come here again and give them a second chance because our meals were good and I look forward to having their specially made sushi selection.  It just won't be for a very long time because they need to figure out how to manage the staff first.  We have a sushi place we LOVE (Tomo's) so H's has a lot to live up to.

The Environment.  You can do hibachi, hang at the bar or have a sit down.  The environment is pretty foo-foo and definitely restauarant-y and not some hole-in-a-wall.  Probably a good date place but there were families there, too.

The staff.  They were initially out of menus and hubby and I had to share.  Luckily, the hostess was able to snag another one but that was our first impression.  Not a good one.  Well, our first impression was actually having to wait for almost 10 minutes to be seated when there were obviously plenty of empty tables, just not enough staff.  Our waitress was very apologetic b'c of the long wait and constantly asked us if we needed anything.  I'd rather have that than be ignored but she probably could have toned it down a bit.  Actions speak more than words and for the time we had to wait for our food, they really should have given us a discount instead of just saying \"I'm sorry\" 20 times.

The food.  We were in the mood for cooked food so we got the Bento A and B - salmon (a) and beef (b).  It came with rice, tempura, shumai, miso soup, and salad.  Mine also came with a california roll and hubby's came with 4 pieces of sushi.  The salad, soup, and main meal all came at the same time because of the backup which really sucked.  The breading on the tempura didn't taste \"light\" like a tempura should taste (you know what I'm talking about - the difference you get between calling it a tempura or basically just fried shrimp).  The rest of the food was pretty good.  Miso soup tasted lighter than most places which I loved.  I've had better california roll but it does pass muster.

The menu.  There was a pretty good variety of stuff there between hot and sushi.  They had some interesting sushi selections that I'd like to try next time but just didn't feel like having that day.  Our meals came with the basics and hubby commented on the 4 sushi pieces he had with his Bento A meal \"It was OK but I have had better.\"  I didn't try his so I can't comment.  I liked their California roll that came with my dish (but I have had better).  They have descriptions of the various rolls (which most places that cater to Americans do) so that will be helpful in your decision-making.

If you're testing this place out, I would visit when it's not peak hours.  It's definitely worth a shot.  It just wasn't worth the time (i.e. long wait)."}
{"text":"It was my 1st time here & will definitely be my last.   Arrived at 7 pm & was seated, party of 3.  20 minutes later 1 of the waiters came & took our order of drinks & appetizers. 25 minutes later,  another waiter came & asked if we were ready to order.  We explained we had already ordered with the 1st waiter.  1st waiter comes back & asks what we ordered,  looks at his notes & says he'll get our drinks.  Another person then brings out drinks.  2nd waiter comes back & asks what we ordered & says they work together but some is really not #1 waiter table,  he didn't care & didn't put the order in.  After an hour of waiting 1 of our 3 appetizers arrives.   We had to ask 2 waiters for napkins,  another water & another plate since there were only plates for 2. 2nd appetizer arrives & has hair in it.   We're done trying to give this place a chance.  Ask for the manager.  15 mins later,  ask someone else for manager.  3rd appetizer arrives,  we explained we were not eating & would be leaving,  he leaves 3rd appetizer anyways.  Finally go to the host & ask for the manager.  20 minutes after originally asking for manager,  we got one.  He apologizes,  we leave.   Worst service ever & i can't comment on the food because we never ate it once we saw the hair!"}
{"text":"Me & family went this past weekend food was terrible the cook we had looked in a rush to get the hell out of there didn't even give a fun show to our kids not just that, vegetables were Burnt & tasted not good at all, we had ordered steak, chiken & shrimp, chicken was not even cooked all the way, as I was chewing I had to take it out of my mouth it was just embarrassing because there was more ppl there in the same table with us, they were complaining too. Also our server came with the check & it was a high amount of $ that he had mistakenly added stuff we didn't even ordered we were just soooo disappointed never again I'll go there!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable $6 for chicken bowl had less then 1/4 of a chicken. When asked how much for a side of chicken we were told $9 to $10. Now a manager cannot come cause he's cooking...REALLY!"}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced for what you get.   Everytime my wife wants to go here I think to myself \"another $40 wasted\"....      It just isnt that good...."}
{"text":"Wow!! What a waste of a night out!! 
So without going into detail about the ghetto menu and decor in there lets get to the real problem! 

While the \"chef\" was cooking our dinner the grill kept going out and was totally broken. He didn't make it a show and was stressed out the whole time. He knew the grill wasn't really working yet he continued to cook on it. 

The rice was hard. The veggies were not cooked and then the shrimp and steak tasted bland and since the cook was trying so hard to overcompensate for the broken grill that he left the meat on there for so long it was well done.  And then he finally gave up and took the chicken in the back and cooked it back there. 

When a restaurant makes a mistake they need to make it right some way. Remake the food or give the meal free. Then when the chicken was brought back out to us the manager was just like sorry the grill was broken and then left. 

So we got a box took all our food home so we could cook it and when the bill came, no discount at all. 54 bucks for 2 meals that were not cooked and tasted bland and like crap!! Serious?!?! 

Basically this place does not give a crap about how your experience is. 

I hope this places closes down soon! That way they can't waste people's time and money!!"}
{"text":"Food here is very good. Service? Eh... Not so much. The owners are usually not willing to make things right on the bill based on experience. But the rice at the hibachi tables is really good! The sushi happy hour specials are also very good. But happy hour sushi prices are for dine in only. You pay double if you wanna take it to go."}
{"text":"I am visiting the Phoenix area for the weekend for a family wedding. On the way to our aunt's vacation home, my parents and I stopped here. We wanted a table in the front of the restaurant but they were full, so we were seated in the hayashi section. I'm glad we were! We all ordered sushi, but 2 young ladies were seated at the same table as us. We got to watch the chef make hearts out of rice and volcanos out of onions while making their food. He tossed broccoli in their mouths. We were getting a kick out of it, especially when he turned to us and started flicking broccoli to me and my dad. The owner or manager came by every once in a while to check on our table and ask if we were enjoying our meal. If we were staying in Arizona longer I would really love to go back for the hayashi experience. The closest thing we have in the Bay Area that is similar to this is Benni Hanna, but I wish we had a Japanese food restaurant with a similar kind of dining experience. I would take all of my friends here! I HAD to get a gift card for my aunt and uncle to thank them for letting us stay in their vacation home. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"We LOVE the teppanyaki here! I always get the chicken with gluten free soy sauce, and hubby gets the steak and scallops. It's an expensive dinner, but I receive $10 off coupons in the mail all the time for this place. The restaurant could definitely use a good cleaning and updating. It looks pretty run down in places and the ventilation is not great near the hibachi grills. Quick service is hit or miss but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"We ate in the dining room from the sushi menu. The service was good, I will say that. The server was obviously new but attentive. That was really the best part of our meal. We ordered bento boxes which came with miso soup which were all disgustingly lukewarm. When the bento boxes came, everything but the Tempura was cold. That would include my steak teriyaki and the shrimp shumai. They were cooked but obviously they had been sitting around for quite some time. I therefore thought the theme of this meal was mediocrity."}
{"text":"Food is good! We been twice once at the hibachi dinning ordered the steak and lobster for two real good! The chef was entertaining but for the price plus tip I can hit my spatulas together all day at home! Also the place needs some maintenance ASAP! The day we where the ac was not working they had fans, looked dirty all over the floor and the girl picking up the tables was cleaning with disgusting dirty rag! Second time there we dined in there was bugs on the light above our table! Food is good but idk what management is doing!"}
{"text":"This place has outstanding service and food. Their happy hour menu is great and the beers are ice cold!"}
{"text":"I usually eat at Hayashi with my wife and child. Today I decided to go in there alone and eat at the bar. The beautiful waitress took my order and promptly gave me my drinks.  When I ordered the two guys behind the sushi bar, one in particular was acting very shady.   One would duck down behind the bar and had a heavy cough.  The other guy was making sushi and would glance at me like nothing was wrong. The waitress also went over there to check my order and looked at me as if something shady was going on.  The guy with the heavy cough popped up chewing as if all was ok.   I did not feel right.  I asked for the waitress to come over. I told her I do not know what's going on behind the bar but I was not comfortable with it and asked to pay for my drinks and leave. She motion to the sushi maker to 86 my order and he appeared to be upset with the other guy.  When I paid for my drinks I left telling the waitress that was not good business.  I have my receipt if anybody would like to contest."}
{"text":"This business is lucky to even get a one star from me after our extremely poor service last night. My family and I decided to have our Valentine's Day dinner here since we love the food and we called to check the wait which was only 30 min for dine-in (restaurant side, NOT teppanyaki grill). Once we arrived, my daughter put us on the list and we sat down to wait. Well, the server was literally just calling people to seat them without even looking at the list!! But wait, it gets better!! 

We sit down and they give us the wrong menus so we ask the hostess for the right ones. Server finally makes his way to us to take our drink orders.  We get our drinks and we wait another 20 min before our actual order for food was taken which is still understandable since it is Valentine's Day and they are doing the best that they can. 

Another 30 min go by and only the sushi and appetizer come out. Another 30 min pass, and we finally get our entree but WITHOUT ANY SILVERWARE OR NAPKINS! Not to mention that we were never even offered refills. We had no choice but to eat with our soup spoons at this point and when the server came by to ask if everything was fine, I gave him a twisted look and raised my SOUP SPOON, but do you think he got the hint? NOPE!! Nothing to wipe our hands or mouths with and eating our food with nothing but a soup spoon. The server never came back after that, and in fact the people sitting behind us got up and walked out because of the service. 

I got up and asked for a manager who came out about 10 min later just for him to say\"ohhh I so sorry\" and only offered $10 off the bill which was whatever at that point. We arrived at 7:45pm and didn't leave until almost 9:30pm!! Needless to say we didn't leave a tip at all which is not something we have ever done. 

If you are going to be a server, please take note of the common sense things to do like 1) Seat your customers with the right menus, 2) Make sure we have napkins and silverware at the table, 3) Offer refills even if it doesn't look like we need one, and 4) At least acknowledge your customers and observe the table so you know what we are still missing. Very disappointed and I hope that the owner takes note of reviews like this so they can really do something about their service/servers. 

P.S. If happy hour is not offered during special holidays like Valentine's Day which is understandable, maybe you should update your signs which clearly state the following \"HAPPY HOUR IS OFFERED EVERYDAY\" without any fine print anywhere.  Very misleading and oh the tape on the benches where you wait don't look very pleasing to customers either.

EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER AT THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS COMPLAINING YESTERDAY WHICH IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND UNACCEPTABLE!"}
{"text":"My husband and I and our 2 daughters, age 8 and 16, at here on Valentine's day. We were very impressed! The food was DELISCIOUS and the sevice was suberb! Everyone from our waiter to the cook were very professional and friendly. The cook entertained the kids and made us all laugh. Our glasses were always full. Even at the end, the manager came and shook our hands and asked us how our dinner was. It is a little pricey, but you get a lot of food for the money, and keep in mind that part of what you are paying for is the experience.  They also usually have a coupon available in the Money Mailer. We will definatelt be back!"}
{"text":"West Valley's newest sushi restaurant. Truly excited to bring the entire family! 

PROS:
1. Good location. Close to home.
2. Nice venue and presentation.
3. Large enough for big celebrations.
4. Special rolls I ordered were well presented and tasty.
5. Good kids menu with appropriate portions.
6. Sake was pricey, but excellent.

CONS:
1. Brought the entire family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children). Asked if they had a happy hour menu and told yes. Sat down and presented with the happy hour menu only to find out that the sushi had to be purchased at the \"bar only\". Very disappointing!!! Every other restaurant has a happy hour that extends to the main dining area. Was I to move my entire family with kids to the sushi bar area?

2. Ordered two handrolls of spicy scallops topped with tobiko. The first was brought out with what looked like pureed \"something\", but was reassured it was their version of the scallop handroll. Told the 2nd roll would be brought out shortly due to them running out of scallops. 25 minutes later, the 2nd spicy scallop handroll was delivered with what actually appeared to look like a traditional spicy scallop handroll. 

The 1st TASTED like pureed \"something\". The 2nd actually tasted like a spicy scallop handroll. Unfortunately, both were disappointing! 

3. Not competitively priced, compared to their local competition. Nigiri sushi is priced individually at this restaurant. Most others are priced for 2 pieces.  

4. I normally spend a minimum of $120-150 including tip for my family of 5 when we're out for sushi. For the quantity and quality at this restaurant, I was not happy to pay the bill.

5. Someone (not a manager) asked how our experience was. Although he denied being a manager, he was more than willing to listen to my constructive criticism. While I appreciated the mindful ear, it still won't change the fact that I'll probably never go there again, nor refer our numerous family friends. There are too many other family friendly options in the area.

6. Extremely slow service. The restaurant wasn't busy, having only been open 1 month. Yet, with all the staff available, it seemed very odd that our service was slow.

In this economy, I am shocked at the overall service and quality received. I definitely would not recommend. There are too many other options in the area.

My review extends to the sushi menu only.  We did not try the teppanyaki grill area."}
{"text":"It felt dirty walking in, when they lady say us there was still food on the table next to us which we found to be gross. They took other peoples orders and served them even though we had arrived before them. Food was alright. Don't recommend"}
{"text":"It has gone waaaaay downhill. It is not even fun anymore. Friday night, 50 degrees and raining and there is an obnoxiously loud DJ on the patio....huh?"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends and the food was pretty decent, but I have to admit to wish you got more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Great food and sushi rolls. Excellent happy hour got to have the sake bombs it's fun with friends"}
{"text":"My family and I came in here because we were really craving hibachi and our normal place we go to was closed for another hour. We decided to give hayashi a shot. I'm pretty sad we did, the service was quite slow and it took forever to get our drink order taken and for our drinks to arrive. The hibachi chef was great though except the portions on the vegetables were skimpy because he forgot he had to split them up since some wanted no onions. We wanted onions and ended up getting the end of the veggies which left us with not the normal portion we usually get. My other complaint was that my shrimp tasted very funny, like old or rancid. The chef swore they ordered it fresh but I knownmynpallet and something was definitely not right. They took the shrimp off of the bill which I am appreciative of since I did not eat them. All in all I will stick to Ah So and was pretty disappointed in my experience here at hayashi."}
{"text":"This was a very fun time on the Hibachi grill side. The Sea Bass fish I got was one of the best tasting grilled fish I have had in a very long time. This is a very big restaurant with a large bar, formal dining area, sushi bar, and the tepanyaki grills. There are some very talented and fun grill masters, but there appeared to be one or two still trying to figure it all out. 

The tepanyaki side is a bit on the expensive side I thought... I believe starting in the $25 area, and going up. What you get is a ton of laughs, food flung at you, all while you watch your food submit into submission by the ninja food masters. 

Very fun time with the group we sat with, would go again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a bit dated and really could use a major update. That said the food is great especially on the teppanyaki side. It's fun the food is priced right and the staff is great. I would highly recommend this for any special occasion!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is really good - some of the best we have had in Phoenix actually. I am sure everyone feels this way but we have eaten sushi for years while we lived in Asia and eaten it fresh off the boat the years we lived in Hawaii - and Hiyashi has good sushi! Having said that - the service is pretty awful and the dining room feels pretty beat up and dinghy. What we usually do is grab it to go."}
{"text":"Sake Bomb!!!  Sunday night this place has the best happy \"hour.\"  All night happy \"hour!\"
Average tempanyaki food, but great service and very clean and great for big parties."}
{"text":"I would never recommend this restaurant!!! I received a gift card for them. Asked how much was on the gift card they told me it didn't matter they don't except gift cards!!!! Asked to speak to the manger , he told me he wouldn't honor the gift card. I didn't understand considering it was a gift card for there  restaurant specifically. The manager told me there has been fake gift cards given to him in the past so he would not honor my regardless!!!! There customer service is ridiculous!!! Poor excuse for a manger!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi, great service & amazing happy hour!  The only think I would suggest is gluten free soy sauce so I don't have to bring my own."}
{"text":"My friends and I love to go around to different sushi places and this was next on the list. We walked in with mediocre expectations and those were barely met. Service was alright, we were seated immediately but the wait staff could've been more personable. NEXT. The food we ordered was off the happy hour menu, so we weren't expecting a huge meal or anything. I got the Tuna Sushi and the spicy tuna roll. For $3.50 I expected more than two pieces of sushi. My friend got the Vegas roll that was lacking severely in salmon. Overall we won't be coming back. If you were to come here the only thing I would recommend would be the spicy tuna roll. Oh and please turn off the air conditioning! It's freezing!"}
{"text":"Food and service were great. Our cook was fun and did the usual flare. I was impressed by my steak and the sushi was tasty."}
{"text":"If you get a chance to request a chef for Teppanyaki Romo is the best I've seen! I've been to many of these types of restaurants in my life, and typically don't care much for the show. Romo however ruled, and was an excellent entertainer! 

My girlfriend said it was one of the best spicy tuna roll she had eaten, and my meal was delicious as well.

My only gripe (and it's kind of a big one) is my girlfriend had ordered sushi and appetizers as her main meal, but they brought out her food before the chef had arrived. We tired explaining that she wanted to eat dinner with the table, and their solution was to return her food to the kitchen and keep it warm until the chef was finished. That's not really cool. They should've suggested to make a new plate when the table was served."}
{"text":"Great expectations..so let down. The server was good and apologetic for one of the plates that did not arrive (and it never did arrive). The plate that did arrive the chicken was over cooked but the filet was cooked great. The vegetables were mainly onions and four giant mushrooms. So disaapointed"}
{"text":"To the owners  of Hayashi !! Mike and Hanna! If thats even your true names!! Your establishment needs not to  automatically charge tips, I was a party of five and got an automatic tip placed on my bill. what you are doing is illegal and I WILL be pushing this Issue to the Business Bureau to make sure your establishment is put under full investigation... I do not recommend anyone to eat at this establishment... TRUST ME! I will be having your establishment investigated. I even had a short conversation with one of your waiters and he even told me he knows what you're doing is illegal! ! I got the gentlemans name, so he can be subpoenaed when you're investigated."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a client at this place about 10 days ago; paid about $90 and lost the receipt somehow...went back three times already to get a copy of the receipt and got the worst customer service ever; three times I waited for a manager to help me, three times being ignored and sent home, with the promise that someone will call me...I stopped by again this afternoon and after finding out that the manager was outside for lunch (really?!?) I was told again that somebody will call me...bad taste in my mouth again! I will never eat there again and I will tell everybody about my bad experience!"}
{"text":"Great food my fav sushi place! The teppanyaki is the best people are friendly. Great service every time I come here. Always satisfied with the food"}
{"text":"To summarize, I probably won't go back.
I give it two stars only because of the ambiance. I was really looking forward to this place opening because I travel a lot and I love Sushi. It's always nice to have options in the West Valley for upscale restaurants- there are so few-especially sushi.
I went there for lunch today and sat at the sushi bar. It was as busy as you would expect for a lunch crowd and well staffed. My waiter was a young guy named Peter. He did not know the menu at all and had to come back and verify my order twice. He did the same to the gal sitting next to me. He also forgot to bring my soup and never came back to check on me.
I had the lunch special, two rolls and miso soup for seven bucks. I also ordered two orders of yellow tail sushi. I thought it was a good deal until it came. Presentation was nice but holy cow; they were the smallest sized portions I have ever had at a sushi place and I have been to many over the past twenty years. Normally when you order sushi a la carte you get two pcs, right? Not here. One pc with a rice ball the size of a grape. I had the salmon skin roll and something called the Alaskan roll with tuna in it. The cream cheese in the salmon roll overpowered everything else and the Alaskan roll was tasteless. The yellowtail tasted fresh and was ok but it was half the size you would expect.
They need to hire someone for the sushi bar (waiter or attractive waitress that knows the menu and has a personality without tattoos and lip piercings, ok? Just saying. This is supposed to be upscale- not taco bell.)
So, that was my experience- very disappointing. Maybe I will give it one more shot for dinner and sit down for something off the dinner menu just to be sure."}
{"text":"Just had a terrible experience here. My hubby and I love sitting at the bar on Saturdays for apps and happy hour. Bartender usually on point. Today we decided to take kids for full lunch in the tepemyaki tables. Our first server took our drink orders and also our food order. He even came back twice to make sure our son's order was correct. Wish I remembered his name. A tall African American. Very nice. Afters orders were taken a hyper skinny white kid came over to say he would be our server instead. We said ok. While waiting a long while for my drink. When a different waiter brought it over, it was already the wrong drink. So an older white server (which by the way that lady has been server there since they opened years ago and has the worse attitude) came over to take it away and I had to wait yet again for the right one. I have to say we had the BEST table cook at the table. He had personality and was super fun. But my husband literally had to get up from his meal twice because nobody came to check on us and we all needed refills. The older lady always had an attitude. When we asked for the check my daughter had to get up to find her to tell her we had an issue with the check. And i watched her be rude to my daughter. Not even turned to listen to her just said fine I'll be right there. I tell her we had an extra plate charged to our bill. She looked at it, questioned it and attitude again like it's our fault they made a mistake. I'm sure her life is miserable after years of the same thing because they can't seem to keep any other server. Every time we go to the bar there are brand new ppl working there. Anyway, lady was rude and arrogant. We will not be going back. Even my kids notice her attitude. Funny thing is that place always has a wanted add taped to their front door for servers and bar ppl. Nobody wants to work were ppl don't come to spend money. Bad form."}
{"text":"I've been twice already, once at the actual tepanyaki table and another at in the \"regular\" section of the restaurant.  Both were great!  I had their shrimp tempura on my first trip and it was absolutely yummmmmmmmmy!  It filled me up quickly and left me wishing I had room for more.  I chose to get the clear soup instead of the miso soup for my appetizer and I liked it more since I'm not a fan of tofu.  But both are great and just as good as other soups I've had at places like Benihana's.  

When I sat at the hibachi table, I ordered spicy tuna rolls (of course!) and wasn't impressed enough...although it was not the worst I've tasted.  It has a really neat and classy atmosphere and both waitresses and the chef I've had were friendly, fun, and provided great service.  I plan to go back, but I will stick with the uber delicious shrimp tempura instead of perhaps trying some sushi.  Their fried rice is also fairly good as well as compared to Benihana's and waaaaaay better than Ah-So's."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what it is. It's almost better for you to cook than go to this place.
Our server Amy was very rude. The manager was very pushy and they even billed us the food we said we don't need it because it was taking forever."}
{"text":"We love sushi and the option for tepanyaki here. The service was SLOW. We were almost ready to walk out after no one acknowledged us after 10 minutes. Finally we were able to order. We ordered sushi which was meh... And the meat and rice from the chef was okay. The chef was fun and the kids enjoyed the experience but we will not be back."}
{"text":"I went here in Christmas Eve with my family. We were a little skeptical at first as their weren't many other customers but we had an amazing time. Our server was named Sam and was very funny and engaging with us. He had to deal with 9 very loud people and was making jokes with us, we even asked him to take a picture with us at the end.

Our chef-Romo did a wonderful job engaging the kids at the table and allowed all of us to be involved in the experience. Romo also did a great job cooking!

The only downside was paying 8 additional dollars for the Birthday special which wasn't more than a song and some fruit. 

I've been to many places like this, but this place have us a good family atmosphere and cared about their customers!"}
{"text":"The food is great! Buuut... The service is terrible... And Dirty Silverware. I wish they would care more about the costumers"}
{"text":"Love Teppan  show but the Steaks melt in your mouth and the vegetables are served hot off the grill. Soup and Salad are include to wet your appetite. I suggest ordering an appetizer while waiting for the soup and salad if your hungry. We order sushi."}
{"text":"Came with the kids.  Service was slow and there were only 10 other people eatting , 4 tables. Waited 10 min just to order food, waiter walked by 3 times before he finally took our order.

Happy Hour menu is very slim, they really need to add more rolls. We only ordered las vegas rolls.

There are only 5 rolls to chose from salmon skin, spicy tuna, spicy crab, ca, and vegas. Rolls are 99% rice.


Next time I think we will go to chief ben. Better selection and faster service. Paid $25 basically for rice."}
{"text":"Good food, clean environment. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because the rice wasn't as flavorful as I've had at other places. Would return again"}
{"text":"Are you kidding?  After several good visits to this spot, we walked in on Father's Day around 4:00 and suddenly the \"Happy Hour\" that is heavily advertised on the outside of the building doesn't apply on a \"holiday\"????  No sign, no warning except for the bartender having to give us the bad news.  The place was a ghost town - why not just close up for the day??  What is with this place?  The owners are pretty stingy and do not treat customers well at all.  Serving staff has always been nice though.  

You might want to rethink this business strategy.  Off to Tomo we went......always a good bet on good sushi.  Don't tip to heavily there though, the owners get most of it but that's another Yelp for another time."}
{"text":"I walked in the first day they opened this location and they were surprised and asked \"how did you know we were open?\" well they had signs! We sat in the restaurant side, not the grill the first time.  Their sushi rolls are ok. A little small and over priced compared to others in the area. But good nonetheless.  We've also been to the grill side and like this much better to other teppanyaki places in the area, they offer fish and other seafood combos which are awesome. This place is also great for kids, they cater to kid food allergies. This is always a plus in our allergy-friendly book of restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was terrible. The server didn't keep track of us at all and we had to ask for everything we needed, often more than once. The Happy Hour prices are good. The Tempura is great, very light batter."}
{"text":"Went here last night with friends. Staff very courteous and quick to follow up on your request. There were 8 total in the group and we sat around the hibachi grill where almost everything is prepared in front of you. Started with drinks followed by egg drop soup and salad. Soup was good salad was small typical for this style of restaurant. Next came the show with the chef twirling his utensils around like a Japanese cowboy with six shooters - playing with raw eggs mixing the fried rice and vegetables with the speed of  The Flash - popping raw broccoli into willing victims mouths with a 70 percent accuracy. He even created the mandatory volcano with raw onions and sent a mountain of flame 6 feet into the air. Final creation was the chicken, scallops, shrimp and lobster for the main course. Everyone was entertained and well fed. Kudos to everyone to a pleasant evening out."}
{"text":"Yes, great happy hour times but not a great selection off the happy hour menu.

I have ordered all the rolls on the happy hour menu.  The thing that gets me is that they put a heavy portion of rice of them.  This was especially noticeable on the spicy tuna roll.

Don't get me wrong.  One of the Sushi Chefs made sure I was taken care of since I had been sitting at the Sushi Bar for some time but I was ok with that since he took the effort to get someone to me.

Consistency on service and food quality is not on top of my \"Thumbs Up\" list but it isn't the worst Sushi place I've been to."}
{"text":"The family and  I have always enjoyed going to Teppan Style Restaurants, its always a great experience. Tonight, we visited Hayashi Habachi Grill for the first time. 

We were seated within 5 minutes at a hibachi table. Hayashi offers the standard fare for a teppan style restaurant, and the prices are competitive for the area. On this visit we had sushi to start followed by the steak and scallop dinner. 

There were only three people in our party, and the restaurant wasn't very crowded. However, It took quite a while for a chef to arrive and start to prepp and cook our dinner. All our entrée's were properly prepared with the requisite flair of  a teppan table, the entrée's tasted fine, and the servings were more than adequate. It's just the lengthy wait to be served.

The very lengthy wait won't keep me from going back however I'm in no rush to revisit any time soon."}
{"text":"To start off we went during lunch time. So it wasn't very busy. The service was great. Very friendly and nice staff. The food was very good. We had teppenyaki
And sushi. The sushi was fresh and the other food was very good. I had no complaints and will be returning."}
{"text":"Very good a fun place for a date night. The appetizer were really good. The drink specials were nice. The teppanyaki was great. The steak was perfect the shrimp not so much."}
{"text":"Walked in around 8 on a Saturday and we were immediately seated. Waited about 15 minutes for our drink order and another 20 for our food order. Waitress forgot to put in our appetizer order. Had some mixed drinks from the bar and were awful. The chef finally came, rushed thru the 'show' and making our dinner. Vegetables were under cooked fried rice was thrown on my plate, not put in a bowl and not very tasty. Meat was ok. Got filet mignon and chicken and shrimp. Food overall ok but I would never feel the desire to return."}
{"text":"Best place in the area and amazing happy hour prices! I recently moved back to so Cal and have to admit this is the only thing I miss about AZ. You can't beat the late night happy hour! Keep up the amazing service and wonderful food and thank you for always assuring complete customer satisfaction!"}
{"text":"Loved it! The service was great so was the food! And the owner was very nice and greeted us and shook our hands when we walked in! That to me is great business ! Sat at the Teppan Grill..yum! For sure I will go back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night, called and made a reservation. When we arrived the host said there was no reservation for us. Fortunately, it was not busy. Our chef cooked everything to perfection, except he cooked my chicken after he cooked seafood so it tasted like seafood.... overall for my anniversary dinner it was a success."}
{"text":"I think this is a cool spot for Sushi probably because I have a hand full of favorites like the cowboy roll . How ever over time the overall ambiance has kinda of declined I usually get the same waiter think his name is Cesar really cool guy were always laughing but the things like the dishes and cups all changing to a real cheap plastic just isn't rite . And they've been having a problem keeping the good Sushi chiefs ."}
{"text":"Hayashi is always a great cheap Asians restaurant. If you want a decent priced Habachi dinner or even for happy hour this place is the place to be. A few nights ago my boyfriend and I came for sushi after the gym and sat at the sushi bar(my favorite for a casual dinner night) sushi chef was being treated poorly by other customers but when he saw that we were nice and polite he was being extra great and helpful for us, he even gave us a few free sushi samples! Overall it's not the greatest most delicious Asian food but it's definitely worth a try for the prices. Have and would come back multiple times. Service is also very decent everyone's helpful and very polite!"}
{"text":"Sooooooooooooo damn good the Las Vegas roll is everything. Happy hour is perfect perfect perfect come here every weekend!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time here. We just moved to the area from San Diego. We had such a good experience here. I tried the pear martini, it was amazing. Jose was our chef and he not only prepared the food perfectly he was really funny too! Overall best place I have been to in the Phoenix area so far! We will be coming back many times and will be recommending to our friends."}
{"text":"Ordered drinks from the happy hour menu as soon as we sat, ended up getting them 45 mins later! They ended up taking them off bill. Food came out fast and was so so. Had one order of the S&B and it was way over cooked. The menus were sticky and grimy. The bathrooms need a massive top to bottom scrub! Besides to bartender, the services was awesome!"}
{"text":"Not the best experience. Ordered sushi, took over 45 minutes to eat the sushi, and when we finally got it, it was cold. Okay flavors but the sushi pieces were too big."}
{"text":"Tried this place April 19th. Service was great. Portions not like typical sushi restrurants. Rice in sushi was very dry. Fish not fresh. Service good. Woke up the following morning with food poisioning. I ordered a rainbow roll and seaweed salad. Thinking it was the rainbow roll that caused my illness. It was all I ate all day. Avoid this place for sushi definately not fresh. Contacted manager following day regarding the food poisoning and he was rude and said I definitely didn't get it from their restaurant. I ensured them that I had only eaten there but he got mad and wouldn't listen to me. I wasn't trying to get money back it anything free just wanted to make sure he knew that their fish wasn't fresh. Oh well lesson learned."}
{"text":"Brought our 5yo son for 1st time
He Loved it!  Chef was great w interacting w him.  They do the usual flare w onion volcano, egg tricks, but still always a good time"}
{"text":"Really nice place. Me and my gf love it here. We visit at least twice a month. Always relaxing setting and the sushi is great. You must try the \"time square roll\" so amazing!"}
{"text":"terrible service, descent food, and questionable pricing.

last minute dinner so it worked but with additional time I will take the time to look elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"We visited this place a month ago the prices seemed priced too high for what you receive as we ordered appetizers they arrived with over cooked calamari not what I expected at all, I can say the beer was good, 
I feel they need better appealing appetizers to choose from their menu, this establishment seemed clean & staff was friendly"}
{"text":"This review is from March 2014.

My hubby and I went here with my in laws for our last dinner before we flew back to PA.

We were seated pretty quickly but that was the only good thing to come out of this experience.

We waited 10 minutes until someone greeted us at our table. Our waitress took our drink orders and yup you guessed it the waiting game began.

Finally our drinks arrived  and our orders taken we all ordered hibachi meals. After what seemed like forever (30 mins) our drinks empty and stomach grumbling our soup and salad arrived. 
Disappointed that the soup can be considered cold and salad drowning in whatever dressing they use. 

Waiting for our actual meal to arrive and sipping the melted ice from my drink (no one refilled our drinks), a table next to us couldn't take the waiting game (they arrived way after us) was pretty noticeable with their complaints. We weren't at that point yet, patience is definitely a virtue and we weren't in a hurry (a good thing too).

Finally after all the waiting our meals arrived, I have to say it took more than 30 mins from when the soup and salad arrived. 
And yet again a disappointing experience, the food was not warm anymore, the plate was half filled with the vegetables or should I say onions. And the portion of the protein that you get was laughable, the meal was so bland, which I was really disappointed about. My husband and in laws barely ate their food too.

Our drinks got refilled when we asked for our bill, and yes you know it you have to wait for that to come too. 

Our waitress was nice and apologetic, she did look like she had too many tables to serve and that's why all the wait. I gave this place one star, just because our waitress was nice and you can see how hard she was working running from table to table, if not for her I would rate zero if I could.

I left the restaurant wishing that we would have went else where."}
{"text":"Went for dinner around 6pm got in right away on a a Friday night. Food was good got the teppenaki shrimp and steak. I also got a and apple martini but it was a little watered down."}
{"text":"We came back to the tepanysaki table again, our table side chef Leon was the bomb, and our wait service was wonderful.  Why the 2 stars?  The food was good and tasteful on the tepanysaki but the sushi got someone from our group sick.  He ordered the yellowtail, tuna, and octopus.  He was the only one that got food poisoning and he is the only one that had sushi.  After reading the other 2 reviews, it seems that they have issues with their sushi and raw foods.  That is not good that people are getting sick."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time on Valentine's Day. The food was excellent. The service was very good. I would have given it 5 stars but we had a reservation at 7:30 and were told it would be an hour wait for a teppan table. We decided not to wait and they seated us at the sushi bar right away. 

I thought the food was better than Benihana and Ah-So. Benihana has a better Mai Tai."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an impromptu lunch. The place is about what you would expect from a Teppanyaki restaurant. After seeing the many comments about how expensive it was we were pleasantly surprised that the prices didn't seem out of whack with other places like this we have visited. We started with the sashimi appetizer for $15. The sashimi was good although it did seem the pieces were a little on the thin side. I had the filet mignon and scallops teppanyaki lunch for $19 and hubby had the shrimp and scallops teppanyaki lunch for $18. You do get a bowl of miso soup to start out with and it was good - as far as miso soup goes. We did not get a salad however. Not sure if they don't serve salads at all or if you just don't get them at lunch. The chef did the usual antics that occur during a teppanyaki dinner much to the delight of a little boy who was seated at the table with us. The food was fine - nothing to write home about but nothing wrong with it either.  Just average run-of-the-mill teppanyaki. Service was also fine - no complaints. I'm sure that we will be visit again considering it's much closer than our usual places over on the east side of town."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my sister and daughter a few months ago. The service, food, and prices were amazing!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch one time. The men's room was not cleaned overnight I am assuming because it was disgusting... borderline crime scene. It was fairly empty when we got there but the hostess wanted to seat us in a seat with a giant hole in the vinyl. Placed smelled like greasy feet."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch combos, excellent sushi nigiri, and great wait staff; also a fun place given their hibachi chef-table shows. Cornerstone of Goodyear"}
{"text":"I got the Las Vegas roll which was fried yet served cold. The wait service was lacking and the sushi itself was average albeit a little scary to eat. Served with pink ginger, which is always a red flag to me."}
{"text":"The sushi was good and fresh. The miso soup was - well there wasn't much of it in the serving and in the contents. Prefer a little more tofu and greens. It also was just warm. I prefer soup hot. Ambiance was nice and the server was pleasant.  All in all would come back again."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years but just up to recently this place has really gone down..1.the restrooms are so dirty they need to be bleached deep cleanef..
2.john the new manager is so rude he micro manages everything and if the bartenders or servers do not put in a drink or food right away he goes over to them in front of the customer and asks if they charged for the drinks or food. And you cannot enjoy your food or drinks when he's just standing there watching and staring at everything you do.Not good for business
3.The servers and bartenders do not get a till for the register everyone there has to bring in there own money to make change for the customers.
4. The patio never gets washed down people eat out there and customers on a Friday or Saturday night get drunk spit drop drinks and food and nothing gets washed down.does not take much to use a water hose since it is outside.
5.all the bar area smells like stale beer no one deep cleans it either..Michelle is the only 1 we have ever seen bust ass back there always wiping n cleaning everyone else just wipes around things but you see little nats every where...
6.All the windows inside and out are dirty n spitted on nasty.
This place needs a real deep cleaning and they need to get rid of John he has caused this place to lose a lot of business good luck lee and Hanna..."}
{"text":"great/cheap lunch specials :) beef terriyaki, shrimp and veggie tempura, cali roll + tuna halibut salmon sushi all for $10"}
{"text":"Ummmmm its ok staff extremly nice ..but if you have been to benihanna the flavor here is slightly sub par sushi is ok as well..but honestly ive had better...prices are decent....but ill pay the extra and go to benihanna"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say how horrible the owner is. I have been going to this Hayashi for years and never had any issues until tonight. I ordered the exact same thing I always do. I substitute one of my rolls with shrimp instead of salmon. Well the waiter came back and said the owner said I can't do that and I would have to pay full price. Not that I can't afford it but I thought it was crazy I never had an issue with shrimp. So the owner came and asked what my problem was and said she was charging me full price. I told her I always order this and never have a problem. She told me you can stay or leave!! Needless to say I told her I was leaving . She was a total b*****. I felt bad for the entire staff and even tipped my waiter because it wasn't his fault. I couldn't believe she told me to leave over a substitution for shrimp. Now I am at Ah-So and will never go to Hayashi again. She does not deserve to be an owner!"}
{"text":"It's very unfortunate that the cook we had works at this establishment.  Our cook was incredibly entertaining and friendly however, all of the food he was preparing was simply subpar. 

Our steaks were aesthetically low quality and borderline non-edible. 

I saw tape on at least 5 seats, including the entryway. 

Go here if you are looking for an expensive way to feel underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Great service and food! We were the only two at a hibachi table and they cooked our meal immediately...they didn't make us wait to fill the table."}
{"text":"I've only been here for the Sushi Happy Hour (weekday early afternoons).The prices are beyond reasonable at that time. Like $2 - $5 a roll. Considering the price the sushi is quite good."}
{"text":"DISRESPECTFUL MANAGER!!!!  I came here for the first time with my family and it was a good restaurant and good food. Our server was very nice and took great care of us until the manager flipped out on her and threw a bucket right down and yelled. Wow, the manager was very degrading and I felt so wrong that even I had to apologize to our server because of how she was treated! No manager should treat their employee like that especially when you make a scene out of it. I will never return back to this place because of how our server was treated. The rude manager was a female and oriental. It was like out of the show \"what would you do?\" Except this was reality!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi  King and Jason are the best sushi chefs!! If it weren't for them we wouldn't go here anymore! Because once they left for a short time and the sushi wasn't the same.. Good but not great. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night there is a wait because they are packed! My husband and I always eat at the sushi bar thou because there is always an open spot. My hubby and I have tried several other sushi spots and none of them even come close to this place. We always go at happy hour time 8- close and you can walk out stuffed and have a few drinks under $40 the beef Negimaki is like no other.. Melts in your mouth!! Vegas roll is the best I've ever had!! All the sushi is AMAZING"}
{"text":"The Hibachi is not bad here.  We had the scallops, chicken, shrimp, and steak.  If you want your quick fix for hibachi then stop by here if your in the area."}
{"text":"The food is terrible, expensive and the service mediocre. It's insulting to charge this much for food that is arguably worse than Panda Express. If you want to eat overcooked, small portion, overpriced food with shitty pop music in the background, this is your spot for sure."}
{"text":"Come here for happy hour. $5 tuna rolls good size good quality. Great drink specials!! The rolls are not flashy but thats what soy and Wasabi are for!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite roll is the Booty Booty Roll! It's the one I always order from here. It's been a while since I've been here and the sushi chef is still \"King\".  When we came it was packed, which we've never seen before, so service wasn't the greatest, but due to past visits they have been great so it was fine.  After about 30 minutes people began leaving so we were there at the end of a rush and then got better service.

Overall it was a great experience. We sat at he sushi bar and spoke to King, after he had a moment to relax. He truly was non-stop for over an hour getting all those tasty sushi rolls. 

One thing that sucks is that a few of the menu prices have gone up.  They do have happy hour, what feels like all the time!"}
{"text":"2 stars to me is mediocre we ordered off the happy hour menu and pretty good to be honest lacks variety has the most generic selection might as well have a kroeger sponsor on the menu. Had my first las vegas roll here wasn't half bad the deep fried part was a surprise on the taste buds I got ballsy and ordered of the speciality menu since it was a special lunch I went with the 007 roll which was pretty bland I give that a -007 had some weird mayonnaise on top. Then I ordered a Godzilla roll no Japanese were harmed in the making of this roll. It was good nice texture to it but the pieces for the price? Christ thats ridiculous 6 pieces for $10.50. Oh the soup which my friend pointed out looks like dish water was pretty good for just being broth and a couple slices of mushrooms. All in all if you want to return the favor for pearl harbor be sure to not tip."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is ok.  Prices are similar to other teppan places, portions are smaller and prices a bit higher. Overall a B+ A- not bad"}
{"text":"I really like this place the food is great the atmosphere and the DJ on Friday and Saturday nights are AWESOME!  
But the service sucks!
Last Thursday night we sat at the bar and it was at least 15 minutes before we were acknowledge  by the bartender! And I really get it because I'm a bartender myself but all you need to do is make eye contact throw a napkin in front of me  and say hey I'll be right with you it doesn't take a genius to realize and look around and notice that you're busy but when you don't even acknowledge my presence we have an issue"}
{"text":"The food is soooo good! And I love the prices. I do wish the service was a little better, but I still like this place."}
{"text":"Can't say much I did not eat here but had to wait for a hostess for a while to be told  there was not enough staff to accommodate the tempanyaki side."}
{"text":"Holy cow... we had the worst experience here! The one up in Surprise was a million times better!

First of all, we walked in with a party of four on a Friday night and they looked at us like we were crazy. The lovely gal up front asked if we had a reservation, and of course we did not. They weren't very busy at all for a Friday night, but she acted as if they were completely swamped. She informed us that it would be a 20 minute wait like it was the end of the world, but of course to us that seemed very reasonable. I guess we're just used to going to busier restaurants on the weekends?

Anyway, the wait actually took over 45 minutes--definitely more than double her initial guess. Whatever, we were able to grab a few drinks before happy hour was over so we were happy. The bar was actually the busiest part of the restaurant, and their service was fast and friendly. However, the rest of the place definitely took away from our positive initial experience there.

We were finally seated in the normal dining area and had the slowest, most forgetful waiter ever. I also noticed that the Hibachi area of the restaurant had barely anyone in it, so maybe that's why it took so long to get in. Everyone was trying to get into the smaller, normal restaurant section! :P We just wanted a nice regular meal with a regular waiter that night, but unfortunately our experience wasn't so great.

We all asked for waters, and the waiter brought one. Gee, thanks. Communal water? LOL. He also kept forgetting things we'd ask for, so we actually had to ask other waiters/waitresses on THREE separate occasions for things that our waiter didn't bring. We would've reminded him, but he seemed to disappear for long periods of time after forgetting things. He also seemed to know whenever we were complaining about him, because he would show up immediately after. 6th sense for unhappy customers? :)

Now, for the food... I had seafood kabobs, and they were okay. However, two of us had scallops in our meals and they were not cooked correctly. I know it's hard to cook them correctly, but these were just bad. The rest wasn't bad, but nothing great either... especially for the price.

Oh, I think the biggest part that bothered me was the location of the restrooms. It was right next to the kitchen, so it was constantly busy with waiter traffic. This is fine, but the attitude of said traffic was what bothered me. The first time, three waiters almost ran into me on my trip to the restroom. They just looked at me as if I was in the wrong place, and of course I said \"excuse me.\" They didn't say anything... just looked at me and went around. On my second trip to the restroom, three waiters/waitresses were standing in the hallway just talking to one another, blocking the entire walkway. I walked up and stood there, finally saying \"Excuse me, I have to get to the restroom.\" One girl moved to the side a little bit, but the guy standing in the middle had his arms crossed with his elbows sticking way out and didn't even acknowledge me. I had to maneuver around his impertinent elbows in order to fit through the tiny gap the one kind waitress had made for me. Basically, I was thinking \"WTF?!\"

When we were done eating, after we had paid the bill, we then realized that we had been there for over 3.5 hours. Ridiculous! The service was extremely slow and mostly unfriendly, the food wasn't good for the price we paid, and we just ended up being pissed off in general after leaving. This was our first trip to this Hayashi, but we wanted to try it out after having so many fantastic experience up at the Surprise location. I guess the name is the only thing these 2 locations have in common."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving a five star rating is that the chef went to the kitchen for something we requested, and the shrimp on the flat top overcooked. Like majorly rubbery. Our experience otherwise was lovely. They had a table available for us immediately even though we didn't have a reservation and the service was prompt and attentive from that point forward. There were six adults, two school age kiddos and my toddler. The chef was engaging and friendly and, most importantly, pleasantly agreeable about omitting the big fire display because the kids were apprehensive. My filet was like butter and my dad raved again today about his tasty spicy chicken. My sister, who can be particular about her sushi, ate both her rolls- and that's rare for her. We are beverage people so I have to note that the iced tea was also really good. It was fresh and came served over plenty of ice. I'll also note that we initially planned to eat at Ah-So down the road. I attempted to make a reservation with them and it was not logged so we were told it would be about a 45 minute wait. Anybody with kids knows you don't wait 45 minutes before even sitting at the table. I feel confident that we will bypass the Ah-So detour after this experience and head directly to Hayashi."}
{"text":"We had teppanyaki dinner here on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. I was glad that we didn't have to worry about reservations or anything but in hindsight, maybe it should have been a sign. It seemed like the restaurant may need a few cosmetic updates and the plates and cups certainly weren't anything fancy. I ordered a mixed drink and it was blah- and was also served in a heavy duty plastic cup. Not the cleanest dinnerware... The food was okay- we've been to a few similar places around Phoenix and this was probably the most bland. Based on the amount of sauces the chef put on everything, I would have expected more flavor. So not sure if it just cooked out or if it needed something different. Our chef was nice and engaging but also underwhelming. For the price we paid for the two of us, we were expecting a lot more.  Now to continue our hunt for awesome hibachi in AZ..."}
{"text":"Walked in, waited 4 minutes to be seated. 
Multiple people looked at us, no one was willing to help. (Mind you there was ONE party of about ten people there - so they were NOT busy) 
Sat down, looked at the menu as we were greeted by yet another rude server and just walked out. 
Would not recommend them just based on the service."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go for the hibachi for lunch here. It's super dirty. It smells like stall food right when you walk in. We paid 40$ for what tasted like heated up food. Very disappointed with the service as well as the overall restaurant. If you are looking for a nice restaurant for the family don't go to this location. The food was over cooked and it was not clean at all. Wouldn't recommend it. The chef on the other hand was very nice and was very respectful but other than that I wasn't impressed. Waste of money at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Service was good, everyone was friendly and the sushi is good and the prices are great! The happy hour is a good deal. The outside area needs tending, clean Windows, sweep up cigarettes and wipe down tables and chairs. I would still come back..."}
{"text":"We walked in about 8pm. Before we opened the door, the host was enjoying his pre-break meal behind thebstand. We opened the door and we're greeted with  a blank stare. Not a \"hello\" not a requisite question of \"how many?\" Blank. Stare. 
After driving from one side of the valley to the other, I needed a facilities visit. Imagine my surprise to see a stall that had been used to help cure an upset stomach. Gross. I was ready to leave at that point. I came back to the table my husband was sitting at and discovered he was already ordering. Great. 
The server was mostly attentive, and he was friendly enough. He placed forks on the table for our salads. Mine looked as though it was merely dunked in some water and left out to dry. Mmm... leftover something else. Of course, it was replaced, but eww - gross. The soup, while very plain looking, had a decent broth. 
The rest of our food came out shortly after. It looked like quite a bit of it. The steak was cooked decently, and the vegetables were OK. The rice, however, that was questionable. I tasted it and immediately regretted the rice. There is something used in the prep process that coats your tongue and the back of your throat with sludge. Gross. 
All-in-all it was mediocre at best. There was no instance of me thinking this was a nice establishment worth $30 a person. The food was way overpriced and sorely lacking in flavor. I left disgusted and annoyed that I stayed because he wanted to. 
This was a learning experience for me, though. I learned that this place is to be avoided! I paid my fine and will never have to do it again. Gross."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and sat at the bar. There are no sushi rolls on their happy hour menu. WTF? 

Ended up ordering the calamari, shrimp shumai, spicy tuna roll and Honolulu roll. 

Everything was mediocre. The best shrimp shumai ever is at Stingray Sushi. The one at Hayashi just didn't compare. The sushi rolls had some sort of crunch to them. It was probably the fake crab stick they put in there. Or it might have been frozen on the inside....whatever it was...wasn't appetizing. 

Also, even though it was happy hour, it was still expensive.  They also spelled edamame wrong on their menu.  I guess that's what you can expect from Goodyear."}
{"text":"Hayashi is recently under new management.  The new owner was extremely involved and going from place to place throughout the night.  Our chef was a little on the sloppy side, not something I am used to at a Japanese restaurant. (He wasn't Asian.)  ;)   The food was a little bland, and it wasn't just my food, the wife felt the same way.  The atmosphere was actually quite festive.  We could have done without the loud drum they use for singing happy birthday for everyone.  Since when does EVERY SINGLE restaurant have to sing happy birthday??  And I was a little shocked when the bill came.  It was a little on the high side, even for teppanyaki.  But what drops my rating for this restaurant is that in their efforts to draw in a crowd, they got a DJ that plays music very loudly on Friday and Saturday nights.  Imagine our surprise, leaving a Japanese restaurant and hearing booty music.  I don't know.  I just think it will attract the wrong clientele.  Just my opinion.  There is much to be said for a place that embraces the heritage of the food and not just the food itself."}
{"text":"Chilled at the bar for Happy Hour with the ladies. The Caribbean martini was pretty good for a Monday evening, but they should have more sushi rolls on their Happy Hour menu. That's my only disappointment. The Las Vegas Rolls ...were to die for! Absolutely delicious. We'll be going back again for round 2."}
{"text":"I tried the grill side and was pleasantly surprised about the food.  I tried the couple's steak and lobster (~$65, yum!), the chicken and shrimp (~$30, a-ok), soft shell crab appetizer (~$12, yum!), squid salad (~$12, a-ok), rainbow roll (~$12, meh), and caterpillar roll (~$12).  The lobster was HUGE, the steak was almost satisfactory in terms of quality and the way it was prepped and cooked.  The shrimp were HUGE and the portions were more than generous.  The fried rice was a-ok and the veggies were cooked perfectly.

Other important info: service is friendly and a bit scattered, portions are generous, chef was nice and sometimes funny but most of his jokes and moves were canned (VERY SIMILAR TO BENIHANA'S, if you've ever been), and ample parking."}
{"text":"Hubby and I wanted to go somewhere different and a little special for a well deserved late lunch/early dinner on Saturday.  We talked about craving well prepared meat and that we didn't care how much it cost, so long as it tasted great.  We thought and thought and thought about where to find that out west and then it came to us:  the new Japanese Steakhouse!!!  We were really impressed by the beautiful decor when we walked in.  The service was excellent but the food was not.  The highlight of our meal was the clear soup - perfect in every way.  

I ordered chicken, he ordered steak.  45 minutes later (and it was so not busy) out comes two plates with cubes of meat on them.  What??? Really??  And we had inquired about the fried rice and were told it was cooked on the hibachi and was delicious, although our waiter noted as he set down our plates that the fried rice we were being served had been prepared in a wok.  Hmmm - which is it?

The food was not hot.  Not at all.  It was warmish only.  The rice was the worst I've ever eaten.  No amount of soy sauce or ginger sauce could improve it, either.  The chicken was tasty but would have been better if it were hot.  The steak was really tasty but again, served warm, not very appetizing.  The vegetable medley was a very nice mix of zucchini, carrot, onion, broccoli and mushrooms, but served warm and somewhere between raw and cooked it was just not good.

After tipping our sweet little waiter, our total for these two incredibly underwhelming plates of food was right at $50 (no liquor!!).  For that amount I'll buy some fabulous filets at Costco and cook them myself. Probably never going back after reading all the food poisoning reviews."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Prices are not bad at happy hour. Sushi chefs are very helpful."}
{"text":"We had dinner with a group of friends last night. We were seated promptly and the waiter showed up immediately to take our drink orders. After giving us some space he came back for the food order, and was knowledgeable about the menu. Then the fun began. The chef arrived, confirmed all our orders and lit up the grill. I love the way they cook with flair, it's as good as the food.  
I had steak and shrimp and it was excellent. Priced a little high, but it's not something our group does frequently. I think we all will definitely go back."}
{"text":"S'okay...

Took my sister here for her birthday.  The interior is very nice and the staff was courteous.  We had three kids with us total and they were patient, as well as quick with drinks and appetizers.  The setting also encourages good family conversation.

The teppanyaki presentation was middling, at best.  Nice guy and all, just used to seeing better skills.  And the older dude working the table across from us seemed to think that just adding more fire = better = big tips.  Instead, he singed his eyebrows and nearly set of the dry fire suppression.

The big knock on this place is the price point.  A tad high."}
{"text":"This establishment seems a little run down but I usually visit for lunch and it is worth it.

The lunch specials are decently priced and the sushi rolls are tasty and very large! I always leave full! Service is friendly and prompt. 

I just can't get over the fact that this place could really use some renovation and TLC. The booth seats are all cracked and decrepit looking... Something that kind of gives me the heebie jeebies. 

I would love this place so much more if it just felt cleaner."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for lunch today for our first time and it was an amazing experience! Sat at the sushi bar and our chef was super sweet! Our waiter david was also super sweet and answered all my million questions lol we will really be back!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday for lunch. Food was very good. The show was excellent. I would definitely recommend this place. Just as good as Benihana's."}
{"text":"Trust the reviews that mention food poisoning...

Wish I would have read more reviews before dropping $120 here. The 2nd star is added because our \"chef\" was fairly entertaining. 

It was a strange visit from the start. We were seated at a grill that was probably already 20 minutes into their service - finished with soup and salad already. They were asked to move over to accommodate us and it was obvious they were annoyed as anyone would be. 

Due to the fact they had all ordered already, we were pushed through our menu gazing. Every couple of minutes asked if we were ready to order. 

Dinner was your typical banging of utensils on a flat top accompanied by some fire.  Exactly what you'd expect. Our 2 year old thought it was cool even if it scared him a few times. 

There was something off with the shrimp, but against my best judgement, I proceeded to eat it... a decision I would regret pretty quickly following dinner. Good thing we only live a mile or so away, because I don't know if I would have made it any further!

My wife and I had the exact same food except she must have known better and steered clear of the laxative, I mean shrimp - lucky her. 

Unless I feel the need to expel my insides again, we won't be back. Good luck to anyone that's braver than I!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out on a Saturday night at 6 as a friend wanted to try them out. Sat at the grill and it was already a pretty busy night for them. This place gave that family restaurant feeling rather than hip ambiance, which they didn't seem to appear like they aimed to be one or the other. Even though I sat at the teppanyaki grill I just wanted appetizers. The waiter was very attentive and I got everything I've asked for. I had to ask for soy sauce which was kind of different. 

Free soup came (didn't look or taste like miso, they didn't say it was anyways, regardless it tasted good)... had to try their calamari strips and it was alright. Also tried their nigiri and that too was alright. Same with their baked green mussels. I'm glad there's nothing about the taste of the food I ordered I disliked. It was satisfying. 

I did look into yelp reviews prior going and noticed the same women's bathroom stall lock is still the same makeshift bent metal lock and the bathroom was just dirty... like a public park restroom during an event but before it gets too filthy later on at night when the drunks come out to play. How long will that broken stall lock take to repair in the bathroom?! The service and food are great! Super friendly & I'll have to admit, I'm surprised they didn't keep us off the teppanyaki table as we chatted for a good while after and the rest of the table left. The upkeep of the restaurant cleanliness could be better hence the given rating. I'll still suggest for others to try out for themselves."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I've been eating here for years and the food is always great and the atmosphere is awesome... 

BUT as the years go by, the restaurant has started to fall apart and isn't being fixed. There's literal duct tape on the waiting area seats, the women's restroom doors have no locks because of being broken off and never replaced. 

They also leave those big bus boy tubs on the waiting area seats, as if they are putting together silverware for guests. So unprofessional. 

The host stand is manned by 10 year olds that have the zero manners or social skills. It's obvious they hate their lives. 

I really hope the owner reads this and does the necessary updates to the place. The food is expensive enough, they should be able to do maintenance needed and train quality people."}
{"text":"The service is sub par. The place is not kept cleaned at all.  Not the best sushi in town. If you want quality sushi go else where. If your coming here to drink than this is your spot. Not family friendly on a Friday night"}
{"text":"I am probably being a little bit generous by giving 4 stars but since the good was really good I am doing it anyway. 
We were seated quickly having made a reservation. There was the usual wait time I have experienced at every teppanyaki restaurant I have been to waiting for the chef to come over. Our server was quick to come over and take our drink order and the soup and salad was brought out quickly. By the way the soup was super good. I am not a miso soup lover so I was thrilled to have this mushroom broth soup. 
The salad was a typical iceberg lettuce salad and was ok. 
I ordered the Mai Tai to drink and it was really good.  Hubby wanted Corona but the do not serve it so he had Blue Moon. 
We decided to order the couples steak and shrimp. It was only like a $1 cheaper than ordering separately so not a big factor in our decision. Also my daughters menu had a different price than mine did. One in our party had the steak and lobster. 
The chef was personable and put on a good show. We really enjoyed it and the food was very tasty. My steak was very tender and cooked perfectly. 
Things that could have been better-it was hard to get drink refills. I'm not sure if it's just because they were understaffed or if our server was new. With the cost of the dinner $215 for 4 I really expect to have better service. The chef was great bring up the service for drinks etc and I would give a solid 4 stars. Maybe more."}
{"text":"2nd trip was quite disappointing.  Ordered a couple of bento boxes.  The miso soup was not hot, barely lukewarm if that.  WTH, why can't they serve hot miso soup.  Also, the rice that comes with the bento box wasn't Japanese rice.  It was Jasmine rice.  I would be okay with it but it was undercooked.  A bit too dry.  The rice on the california roll was dry too.  Sucks.  Tempura was still decent but the rice and soup really ruined my meal.  It will be a long while before I head back there again.

Learn how to properly cook rice people!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi not so good compared to blu sushi...although teppan was good...blu definitely has best sushi in town"}
{"text":"I have only eaten the Teppanyaki.  The filet is outstanding.  Best filet in Litchfield Park.  My wife and I go here twice a week.  We avoid the weekend or go early as it gets very busy and quickly becomes total chaos.  They don't seem to handle getting people seated well when it's busy.  Service can be spotty.  We know who are the good wait staff.  Unfortunately, with Teppanyaki, you are subject to the luck of the draw.  The place is in need of an overhaul as the interior is a bit of a mess.  Inspire of the drawbacks, we are regulars because of the filet."}
{"text":"Being a huge Benihana fan, I had to try Hiyashi Japanese Steakhouse while visiting Goodyear.
I must say, the greeting and welcoming as we walked in had to be one of the best I have ever experienced. I felt like they knew me here.
After the excellent entrance, we were seated by the Hibachi grill. There we sat for about 15 minutes before the talented chef walked in.
After a fun and exciting show. I had to check if I still had eyebrows. The guy sure  loved playing with fire.
The food was excellent. I had the steak and scallop diner with the fried rice. The service was on point and the drinks constantly flowing. The experience is worth the visit.
I am a fan and will return whenever I'm in town again.

Update 2: 8/6/2014

I said I would be back and I did. As far as the experience goes, nothing much has changed. The service is still friendly and attentive. The food is still up to standards as well as the hibachi experience. 
One thing that I won't lose sleep over but did catch my attention was the booth benches. A few had tears and looked used and abused. I think it is time to update the furniture folks. Besides that, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Saturday. Not busy at all, yet waited forever for our sushi. Only two rolls we ordered. No Miso soup or salad was offered, no refills given on our drinks. Atmosphere kind of off. Just not a very pleasant place. The rolls were okay. Just okay."}
{"text":"Not impressed anymore. They need to power wash the back patio and tables. For a Thursday night,  service could have been better. Spicy tuna roll was the boom."}
