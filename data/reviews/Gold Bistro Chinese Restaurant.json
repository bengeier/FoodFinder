{"text":"Tucked away in a small strip mall is another one of those hidden gems! There are at least 3 other Chinese places within a stone's throw of this place, but it is still my go-to for hot and fresh food, While known for its lunch and dinner buffets everyday, it also does a very busy take out and delivery. 

The buffet features about 20-30 of the most popular items, so don't go expecting a 100-item buffet. Small enough to enjoy by yourself, as a couple, family, or larger groups are easily taken care of as well.

Little secret that the owners shared: they will not fully stock the buffet for fear of waste on slower days. They will put a little of everything out, and if you want more of a specific item, they will make that and put it out fresh on the buffet! Full dishes for buffet price - simply awesome."}

{"text":"I've eaten here several times before, with yesterday being the most recent time, and the food has always been good. They have a good variety of dishes with a high quality. The one issue is that closer to the end of lunch (after 1pm), some of the bins don't get filled as quickly. This is mainly for the most popular items. 

I've only ever had the buffet, and for $12 I have no complaints."}
{"text":"We checked this place out because a flyer showed up in our mailbox.  It's advertised as a buffet so we stopped by after work.  This is NOT a buffet.  There were maybe 10-11 items most of which were dripping in grease and had been sitting under the heat lamps too long.  Spend the extra 5 minutes and go up the road to Asian Buffet. It's only $2 more."}
