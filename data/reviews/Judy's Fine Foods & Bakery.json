{"text":"This might not be a location you're ever going to naturally come across unless you happen to be inside the mall - but it's definitely worth going into if you're nearby. The service is always super friendly and kind. She enjoys what she does and it shows. There's a definite sense of community in the way she interacts with her customers. This is a good breakfast, lunch, snack spot. They have some fantastic baked goods. Everything is made fresh daily and delicious at reasonable prices. I've come here a few times the past couple of months and have always enjoyed anything I've tried here. I would recommend checking this place out as its a great small bakery run by a passionate woman. In particular, I've enjoyed their Spinotta (feta cheese and spinach in a flakey pastry)."}
{"text":"We ate here our first morning in Canada. I needed somethings from Shoppers and this was in the shop. My family needed something quick and budget friendly before going touring and there was Judys. I had the veggie omelet and bagel, my husband the \"big ,\" and my son friend toast. My husband and I rated our food average hence the 3 stars (I can make better at home), but my son loved the French toast! Customer service was excellent 5 stars!"}
