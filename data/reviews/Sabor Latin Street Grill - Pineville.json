{"text":"Bland bland bland! I was thoroughly unimpressed. Although the portions were huge, there was absolutely no flavor to the food- just bland chicken and cheese inside an overly fried shell. 

I will not be returning"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since they opened in Pineville & I'm addicted to the nachos. Everything is so flavorful & fresh, super delicious."}
{"text":"Great service with helpful staff. The empanadas and arepas we're delicious.  Loved the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place, specifically the nachos. I ordered with refried beans and shredded chicken. Someone else had a platter of them in the dining room and they looked delicious but I made the mistake of taking them to go.  It was truly a ton of food, the guac was good but it was a mushy mess by the time I really started eating them and I couldn't make it past the first layer. I didn't care too much for the taste of the chicken but that could be because I was expecting more of the Mexican type flavors that I'm used to."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Great tacos and taco salad with quinoa. Convenient location in south charlotte!"}
{"text":"My wife and I droped in to check it out. Street food is just what you get and plenty of it. The flavor profile is ok. Nacho's were plentiful, queso was very bland, chip were fine. When the waiter brought out the nacho's, we couldn't
believe how big it was. 
  They offer several salsa's which were ok but something was off. The other sauce they had was Russian Dressing called something else.
Since we are vegetarians, we were excited they offered grilled vegetable options, the black beans were plentiful, the vegetables were cut so small you could not identify or taste them. 
  Wife had empanada, filled with super bland 
cheese with very little flavor. Grilled veggy's
cut so small she could not see or taste them.
Price point very reasonsble, however, not our cup of tea."}
{"text":"Excellent, fast latin food - I can't get enough of the three amigos burrito.  It's got that meaty cheesy flavor that's so wonderful. $6 also on Monday's with a drink. Nice people and after 4 visits in 2 weeks, I'm a fan.  Tacos were good too. Very clean tasting. 
Don't miss this place.  Pretty awesome treat."}
{"text":"I have been three times now, and I really enjoy the food here, empanadas, tacos, etc, have all been very tasty, sometimes a bit heavy on the cheese though. They also have some pretty good daily specials. 

The service is fine, no one has ever been rude or unprofessional, however each of my three visits there has been an issue with the order. First time, burrito had under-cooked rice, second time forgot to bring us the drink we ordered, third time the price for the item I ordered was more than the listed menu price. None of the issues by themselves were that serious, but on the other hand each time I brought it to their attention, the staff did not do much to accommodate beyond a simple apology. If more concern for correcting order mistakes and customer satisfaction was shown, I would likely give 5 stars."}
{"text":"I waited until I visited this location a couple of times before writing this review. The first trip I had the Nachos Supreme, which is the best deal on the menu. You receive a huge pile of chips and toppings that are delicious! 

Unfortunately, our second trip was not quite as good. We went for Taco Tuesday and tried a total of six different tacos. Five of the tacos were completely without flavor and bland. The sixth was chorizo, which the Mrs. took one bite of and put down. I guess if the goal is to cover the tacos in a variety of available salsas, then you may be okay. 

The final issue is that you will smell like the restaurant for the rest of the day. I guess than can be considered good or bad depending on your preference. 

We will return if we really, really are in the mood for nachos."}
{"text":"Fast Mexican food with limited service.  Food was good and inexpensive. Nothing special to write home about."}
{"text":"nice collection of spicy salsa's

Good quantity will fill a lot of ppl fully.

Didn't forget to try their pink chips and pinapple harbenaro salsa"}
{"text":"I actually like this location floor plan and extremely friendly staff. My family and I live South and usually frequent the Wesley Chapel location. I stumbled across this location while in Pineville getting my jewelry inspected at Jared's. I pulled up my handy dandy Yelp app as I was in a mood for a Black Bean Taco and this place popped up. I had no clue there was a location in Pineville. 
The parking lot is sorta confusing as the lines at the entry don't appear to be for parking so I headed past the Sprint store to park properly in lines spaces. I walked back to the restaurant and upon entry I Loved the large open floor plan. As I smiled and looked around and headed to the register I had several voiced say \"Welcome\" and there were two registers with two friendly faces ready to take my order. I ended up with a Black Bean Authentico and a Grilled Veggie Americana Taco. I was pleased and extremely STUFFED after having those two tacos. 
I think my super FAV part is the sauce bar and my FAV sauce is The Habenaro :-) 

I didn't write my review until after my second visit and this past Tuesday I had a meeting in the area and decided to grab 1 Taco for a snack. However when I walked in it was TACO Tuesday $1 Authentico Tacos = SCORE so I ended up with 3 tacos 1 Black Bean and 2 Grilled Veggie.
What threw me off is the fact that the tacos were way smaller than my first visit (5days prior) I brought that to the attention of one of the guys just as an inquiry. I was totally cool if it was due to it being Taco Tuesday & the fact that the tacos were only $1. The guy ensured me that the tacos are always the same size, fortunately for me I ALWAYS take pictures so I happily pulled up the photo from 5 days prior to show him and he was shocked and said that was a fluke. All in all when he brought out my 2nd order, as I was still hungry after the 3 small $1 tacos that I had to go back to order two more, he informed me that he added more to replicate my prior visit and ask to take pictures of the picture I had to show his manager to ensure they deliver. 
I appreciated his efforts and acknowledgment of being consistent."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos!  This latest location confirms the fabulous taco takeover that Sabor had accomplished in Charlotte. I enjoyed the authenticos chicken tacos. They're meaty, juicy and delicious, plus add guacamole & chips and your mouth is happy!  Their menu also has lots of options for arepas or empanadas or nachos. I favor the tacos for a yummy yet affordable treat. They have Mexican Coca-cola and Fanta too. Their local brews are a great variety and there margaritas are excellent. This location is near the drive through Starbucks off 51 and includes a parking lot for easy access."}
{"text":"Well, actually I don't know where to start. 

Ordered one Argentinian beef empanada to share, I ordered \"carne asada fries\" & husband a burrito 3 amigos. Two drinks.

Pros: Very clean and friendly staff. Cashier took our order and served us fast. Great atmosphere. Music on point. You don't need to yell! 

Cons: we are from Argentina, so definitely, that was not an empanada. At least, Argentinian. It was ok though. But in Argentina we don't mix ground beef with cheese. (For example).

The burrito was ... meh. (Not flavorful, according to my husband). We were expecting some chips, that's why we got some sauces. But the burrito came alone...

My \"carne asada\", well... the steak was over cooked. A stone! So I only ate the cheese guacamole and fries. 

Our expectations were higher. But actually we were dissatisfied. So, I think that for the price, I can eat better in another Latin fast food or even a restaurant.

Sorry guys, honestly, I know most of you, will say, I don't care if the \"Argentinian empanadas\" are Argentinian. But I felt disappointed. We left hungry. 
So for us, it was just another Latin spot. 

It was not the worst but not the best either."}
{"text":"This is an amazing authentic Latin grill. This isn't Tex Mex taco Bell, Chili's, on the border crap. So if you're looking for the mundane and normal.... Skip this fantastic spot. However if you want fresh, flavor, culture, and a great margarita this is THE SPOT. They offer daily specials, like taco Tuesday, where authentic tacos are only one dollar. Also if you're dining in and want a change, place an order through Uber eats... They'll deliver it right to your door. I recommend the nachos with shredded chicken. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for fast Mexican street grill. I always get the carne asada fries. They also have a salsa bar. My only complaint is that unlike all their other locations in the Charlotte area, they do not offer free chips with a Yelp check in. So don't come here expecting it because they look at you as if you're stupid for asking. I also do not care for the seasoning that they put on their chips."}
{"text":"I'm sure I caught them on a bad night. First, there was no one at the register to take customer orders. If you're placing a to go order there isn't really anywhere to wait so many of us were sitting at tables with patrons who were dining in. Then, they called my name to say my order was ready but it wasn't. 

Got home and was missing ingredients. Nonetheless, the food was still delicious. I had two tacos and it was supposed to be the Elotes Loco but they forgot the cojito cheese. =/ 

I'd try them again and probably dine in."}
{"text":"Was in Pineville, noticed the new Sabor and decided to stop in for lunch. I've been to a few of their other locations and they never disappoint. I ordered their Thursday special which was an arepa and empanada for $6 (great deal!) along with an order of guacamole and queso. Everything was delicious, guacamole was fresh and perfect, portions are huge, the queso wasn't my favorite but that's just a personal preference, I like it spicy. Restaurant and restroom were clean, all the staff were very friendly, and food came out quickly. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious food .... it just is... if you haven't been to a location yet - get there before the word gets out that the Pineville location is open. 
We had a fish taco, one beef and one shredded chicken along with a shrimp power bowl with chips .  Everything was delicious! I recommend you try the salsa bar ... The pineapple salsa rocks ! But there are several there for you to choose from. 

So excited that Sabor opened here and you can be sure it will soon be a crowded place to wait in line ... but don't you know I'll be there !  See ya in line !"}
{"text":"Im writing this review as I finish my meal bc I'm extremely happy with this place. I've heard great things about Sabor and had the opportunity to try myself.

Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, since it was my first time here. I had the supreme nachos and maybe this was my only mistake.

This dish is HUGE! You can perfectly feed 4 people out of if, I'm not kidding. As I got it at my table my first reaction was to get a to go box because there's no way someone can eat all of it. 

I got barbacoa with my nachos, and it was juicy and flavorful. Black Brand delicious, and the guacamole topping the plate is unbelievable! 

It's my first time but I'll for sure come back to try theirs tacos and burritos. You should do the same!"}
{"text":"I love Sabor! The 7th street one is my go to but I must say I might drive the distance for this one. First of all this one has more seating than the 7th street and NODA location, which I love since that is always a hassle. This location will also handle lines better since the line would be sectioned off unlike the other two I've been to.
I had my go to supreme nachos. They made it just as great as the other locations; piled high and beautiful! The service was great ( I believe the manager rang us up and brought us our food, he did a great job) and the food was prepared quickly! They have outlets at the table like the others which I love!
All around if you been to other sabors before you will definitely love this one!"}
{"text":"I stopped by yesterday and ordered the Arepa.  It was fantastic!!!  I had the opportunity to meet Angela and Jeremy, who were so welcoming and gave me the exciting news that a location will be coming near me in Huntersville.

I love Latin food and this place is so authentic.  The décor was colorful and the menu was descriptive and easy to understand.  I will definitely be returning to try everything else on the menu.

Keep up the good work and see you all soon!

{"text":"Based on the good reviews,my husband and I had high hopes for this place but unfortunately it wasn't what we'd hoped.

Sabor offers a pleasant and clean atmosphere but the food could be much better.Before I start talking about whether the food is actually authentic,let's talk about whether it actually tastes good and if it's worth your money.

Again,I really wanted to love this place because I love tacos.Anyway,I've had authentic Mexican food in Mexico and if you know where to look in Charlotte,you'll find authentic Spanish food.Sabor is not the place for authentic Spanish food.The 3 times we visited,we ordered steak and chicken tacos,the protein bowl with ground beef and the gorditas.Each of those dishes was a let down.The meat is VERY dry and lacks flavor.The tortillas were not fully cooked and were still quite stiff.Its also overpriced.Especially considering it doesn't taste good.

As far as how authentic the food is? Not authentic at all.They play Spanish music but that's as authentic as it gets.Seriously,save your money and go to Tacos Nayarit which is a taco truck located behind the golf gas station in Fort Mill.They serve delicious,authentic,quality Spanish food and for a lower price if you can believe it! Thank me later."}
{"text":"Definitely see myself here at least once a week. Clean restaurant, friendly staff, and damn delicious tacos.

Today was Taco Tuesday, which means $1 tacos! I'll be honest, I like that they offer it, but they only do a couple of different proteins and limited styles. So even though I'm paying a bit more, I still got the Locos Al Pastor. Pork so good you wouldn't even think it's pork (sorry Pork lovers, I'm usually don't get excited about it). Outstanding fresh toppings piled generously on 2 authentic corn tortillas per taco.

The salsa bar is great as well. I've taken quite a liking to the Pineapple Habanero, but it's just a bit to spicy for me so I cut it with some of the mild salsa. It's been fresh and delightful every visit to Sabor.

Lee served me and Jeremy was behind the line today. Great service, I've been to the Sabor closest to my house and was real disappointed with the crew. Glad that this one really values it's customers.

Next time I'm getting one of those fancy margaritas! They have a selection of mixed drinks on the menu on the side wall so be sure to check it out.

Keep churning out those authentic tacos and I'll be a long-time customer!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The food had very little flavor and was not hot. The empanada was huge and the cheese inside was a bit much. Plus I've never had an empanada with cheese in it so maybe this is more true to authentic Latin food. 

Lunch specials are well priced however they do not include drinks. Good selection of Bottles drinks in flavors like lime, mango and orange."}
{"text":"Had the epic protein bowl with shredded chicken and chips and queso ...it was ok,nothing spectacular,queso was a bit lumpy,chips are very greasy."}
{"text":"Happened upon this location while running errands so I decided to stop in for dinner all by my lonesome. 

The staff were all very nice, when they brought out my food, the runner brought me extra napkins and a fork so I wouldn't have to get up.

Epic protein bowl was delicious and very filling. But not totally overwhelming in size-- don't get me wrong, I couldn't quite finish it, but still. 

A manager(?) asked me how I was doing, but otherwise I enjoyed the background music as I ate my meal."}
{"text":"This place is frustrating.

The food here is good most of the time. The arepas are my personal favorite!

But there are other times, where the steak is rock hard and over cooked or the chicken is hella salty. 

The part that drives me crazy is ordering to go. They tell you to sit somewhere and they'll bring it to you. Dope! That sounds great. That's literally as far as it gets though. You just sit there while people who ordered after you get served at their tables. When you get tired of waiting you go up and find your food dying down behind the counter. This is not a one off occurrence, it has happened all three times we ordered to go and it's a heckin bummer man...

I want to like this place. Sometimes I really love this place. But man sometimes it's just sadness."}
{"text":"Literally no queso in my to go order again. Everytime. Never fails. Not only this location either! I order carne asada fries and they forget my queso every single time.  I guess I should do my due diligence as a customer and check the bag before I go, but I unfortunately have trust in my eating establishments. I also got a container full of shrimp with burnt on flat top gunk. I need to stop coming here. Smh."}
{"text":"Dollar taco Tuesdays! Can't beat it. Love their selection of different salsas. Friendly staff & clean environment. Definitely would recommend. Everything i have tried so far has been good. Brand new location."}
{"text":"First thing I must say is coming from Dominican background I never seen a Dominican burrito before until I came to this place. Is called \"El Dominicano\" is pretty much a chimichurri but instead of bread they use a tortilla ?? LOL  but overall this place has great flavorful food for a good price Sunday's is half off domestic beers. Y'all have  try the pineapple habanero sauce is a amazing very spicy tho  ! Is just one of the many sauces to choose Fromm so well . Ive been here many times and I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for my burrito falling apart everytime I order one."}
{"text":"I am a huge Sabor fan and am so excited to have a location in this area. I cam here for $1 Taco Tuesday and wow; they were more than generous with their chicken and beef fillings!! Authentic as always with cilantro and onion, these tacos are spot on. The nachos are the best in the city, not to mention the Arepa!! If you don't know what it is , it's a corn cake stuffed with good things like chicken and crumbled cheese, it's my families favorite thing on the menu. 
Everyone was helpful and friendly, see you next time!"}
{"text":"This is such a great \"fast food\" restaurant.  Walk up and order and the food is out to your table within 5 minutes.  Some of the best nachos in town!  Their ingredients are always fresh and delicious.

Last time I went in on a Tuesday, they had $1 tacos!  Great deal."}
{"text":"Omg this place is great for dollar taco Tuesdays and mojito Thursdays! The nachos are the best I've ever had & they fill my fiancé & I both up with one serving. Don't forget the queso dip because it's addicting!!! Staff is friendly & atmosphere is comphy; wish there were more up north!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a great lunch here today. All the food was tasty and good portions. Even the margarita was exceptional! We all agreed the common denominator was fresh ingredients.  There is even outdoor seating and multiple TVs . Daily food and drink specials."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and enjoyed some tasty food!  I ordered the Dominic on a Diet, and it was the opposite of diet food.  The burrito is huge and so stuffed with chicken, I could only eat half. The cilantro lime yogurt sauce on it is delicious!  My husband ordered a ground beef taco, rice and a side of queso and chips. He enjoyed all of it.  The guacamole is super fresh and flavourful and the salsa bar had some great options. We saw several orders of nachos be delivered and they were huge!  We will definitely be coming back to try some of the other menu offerings and enjoy the attentive service."}
{"text":"This spot just opened near my work! Of course, my coworkers and I got some $1 tacos! They were good, but I found something wrong with the order. I called and spoke to the manager, I think it was Lee... but I honestly do not remember, he was very friendly and empathetic. He ended up refunding the tacos! He was exceptional! 

I will go to a sabor again, but I'm just not sure if I'll go to this one."}
{"text":"This is a Latin style fast food where you can get Arepa Venezuelan style street food along with Tacos, empanadas, and many other street food. Very unique yet decent and hybrid."}
{"text":"Authentic tacos!!  Very delicious and great price on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Update: tried to get 3 veggie tacos to go tonight and was told it would be a 40 minute wait.... really?"}
{"text":"I've been to the Sabor on South Tryon numerous times and I've always loved the friendly environment. Even at their super busy times the food is always great and the staff is nice. This location is not the same. The wait times are ridiculous and the staff treats people like inconveniences. I've been 3 times now for to go orders and my food was good 1 out of 3 times. I'd rather drive to the other side of town than come back here."}
{"text":"We've visited this location several times and always had a great experience. Location is nice and clean, has outdoor seating and service is always great. They also have good daily specials. Salsa bar is a must try! The Carne Asada Fries are delicious and highly recommended! We also tried the Empanada and Arepa which were very good. Everything is made to order so its easy to customize each item and...fresh!"}
{"text":"I've driven by here a few times and it always seemed busy, so today I stopped in to check it out. I ordered 2 Americanos taco, one shredded and one grilled steak. Relatively inexpensive. After a 20-25 mins I finally got my go-to order and left. The steak in the grilled steak tacos was really chewy(like a piece of gum) and didnt have a flavor to it. The shredded chicken was much better until I almost choked on a small bone still in the chicken."}
{"text":"I like the food a lot at Sabor. I've been there twice and had the empanadas (great) and the fish tacos, tasty. Margarita was good, too much ice. Since it's really not a sit down restaurant, you'd expect the food to come out faster. It takes a while. Also, it depends on who is your cashier... tonight the service was pretty disappointing. Still, food is reliable and good."}
{"text":"I love Sabor and was super excited to find one right near my home. This is a great spot to grab burritos and burrito bowls. Everything taste super fresh and their flavors are great. If I can't decide where to eat, this is definitely a go to spot. I typically go with a bowl and add everything to my liking. They also are on uber eats which is a plus. I'll be visiting often."}
{"text":"Finding a cool restaurant in a grocery store parking lot was a surprise. They advertise FRESH AUTHENTIC BOLD, and that is exactly what they delivered.  There is alcohol on the menu, which makes this more than a fast food joint.  There is also a kid's menu.   We ordered at the counter and our food was delivered within a matter of minutes.  Good service.   I had a taco salad with chicken and it was a good portion and tasty.  My lunch companion had a chicken burrito that could have fed a village.  We were trying to get on line to solve an issue with an app.   When I asked for the wi-if password, I was told that the wi-fi is only for management use.  In 2017, this is just not in keeping with the times.  There needs to be public wi-fi.  That has become the standard and expectation.  Overall, a good dining experience and I can understand why I see so many YELP check ins here."}
{"text":"My sister chose this restaurant for our lunch today. From now on, I'm letting her decide!! Or... we might just keep coming here every Tuesday. :)

Today, they had $1 tacos. I expected them to be mediocre due to the price. (I've been conned before by cheap food on \"Taco Tuesday\" at other restaurants!) But I was pleasantly surprised!! You can tell that they use real, fresh, and simple ingredients to make their amazing food!

You guys earned yourselves a new, loyal customer today!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their street tacos.  This restaurant filled a gap in The Mexican offerings in this area. They might work on the friendliness of the gal at the register but she didn't detract from the great food."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the shredded chicken empanadas which was my favorite and a shredded chicken autenticos taco. The salsas were a bit spicy for me except the mild and verde. 

Will be back on a Saturday with my husband as they have 1/2 price Craft beer."}
{"text":"This place is great . Fresh ingredients . Wide selection . Huge portions . Will definitely return ."}
{"text":"I was told that the empanadas here were legit and in fact, they are. I was here on a quiet Saturday afternoon after doing a too big food shop (Never shop hungry? Rule broken.). Short queue to place my order and I decided to hop around the menu a little.

One empanada with chicken. One \"autentico\" shredded chicken taco. And one fish taco. It did not take long and my food was brought over to the table.

Excellent presentation. The fish taco was a big pile of colorful shredded cabbage on top of tilapia. Very tangy, very tasty. A little messy.

The chicken taco took a little bit of the habanero pineapple salsa (HOT!) and was delicious. A good portion of soft shredded chicken. Quite drippy but delicious.

My final course, I dug into the empanada after it had cooled just a little bit. Nicely stuffed with chicken and cheese, it also came with a creamy sauce for dipping. Delicious.

A large meal, plenty of flavor, good food. Yum!

They also have beer specials which I might have had if I didn't have my \"friend\" with me."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Great food and friendly faces.  Highly recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"My family and I placed a catering order thru this location- Adon and the crew did a fabulous job with both the food and the service. We will gladly give them our business as much as possible! Food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"YES!  Finally some authentic Mexican tacos.  Got the Al Pastor, Asada, and Barbacoa, plátanos maduros (not Mexican but hey I'm not arguing), and the Elote Loco (mexican style corn with chili powder and mayo). Beers were $2.50 each. Highly recommend.  Super friendly staff.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Solid street Latin food. Quick, reasonable. Have a good meal every time! We love this spot"}
{"text":"What a great new find to add to our workplace lunch rotation. Especially on Tuesdays for $1 (select) Taco Tuesday!

I had heard about Sabor from coworkers for quite some time. So, after this location near work opened up it was time to check it out. I also have one near my apartment in Fort Mill. hey seem to be popping up all over the CLT area.

A bit hesitant after an aforementioned coworker had a serious issue with a taco on the day they opened, (The management handled the situation with an apology and a refund.) I still went with a group of coworkers the next week. It was definitely a hot spot - especially on Tuesdays - so we knew it had to be good.

For the dollar taco deal you can choose from ground beef, veggie, black bean or shredded chicken. There are other taco options for two and three dollars with steak, etc. I had a coworker get ground beef, shredded chicken and steak and he ended up liking the ground beef and shredded chicken over the steak. [FWIW]

If you order a large queso, guac or pico they'll throw in a basket (more like a lundry basket) of free chippies for the dippies. 

Staff is pretty friendly. I did notice on the first visit, the cleaning of tables after people left wasn't happening so some folks had to wipe up their own table. On the second visit, staff seemed to be out and about cleaning up the tables.

Oh yeah .. before I go ... GET THE LOCO STREET CORN! That is all.

adiós"}
{"text":"Yum. I've been wanting to try Sabor for quite some time now and I'm glad it's at a closer location. First time I came here I ordered the nachos with steak. It was very good and filling. Loaded with toppings but not a lot of meat. I can't complain because most of the chips were covered with something. Not to mention they also have a salsa bar!! Second time I came here I got the taco salad with chicken. We ordered our food and sat down. A family of 4 came after us. They got their food before us and I noticed one of them also had a taco salad. My husband got his food served but I still did not. I'm pretty sure my taco salad was served to the other family. We waited and waited and my husband finally had to go up there and ask them were my food was. They made it in a hurry so it was a little sloppy. I didn't mind too much but my husband's food was cold by the time I got mine. Overall, we would visit this place again. The prices are good and that salsa bar is on point."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and great location! Love how much more space this one has. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The best tacos ive ever had love Taco Tuesday 1.00 tacos  yum .  I had 2 chicken n 2 beef they so messy makes it even better.  I ordered some Queso its was perfect an creamy n you get free chips since I ordered the medium size:)  I saw their nachos looked like enough for 4 yum .I cant wait again for taco tuesday get ur taco on lol"}
{"text":"Food is consistently delicious. You can get delivery via Uber Eats or order online and pick up yourself. The tacos are simple and delicious. The carne asada fries are amazing. The nachos are so good but huge (enough food for four people) and they have the BEST tortilla chips. Specials on food and drinks everyday. If you are looking for tasty and consistent Mexican food definitely stop here."}
{"text":"Popped in the other night to fill the Taco Craving Monster. I didn't realize this location was new - it was packed!! Super bonus is they have a website you can order from and just pick up straight from the counter. Yasss.. I love being able to order take out online!

Anyway, to the food. This place definitely hit the spot for the taco craving. I'm not talking about the hard shell corn tacos, either. This is the real deal with the super thin doubled-up soft tortillas with a variety of choices to top with. I recommend the pork, and I think I even saw tongue on the menu. Will have to try that next time. Also, they have yucca fries. YUM to yucca always. 

Don't forget to stop at the salsa bar for a variety of salsa choices, ranging from fruity to mild to holy fireballs. 

Recommend!"}
{"text":"My first experience was a great one. I got the nachos, add chorizo. Fairly priced and a huge variety of free salsas to choose from. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they forgot the queso on my nachos. But honestly, they were so delicious it was easily over looked. And their fresh cojita cheese, or queso fresco, not sure which one it is (crumbled white cheese) is literally worth sacrificing my remaining calories for the day... soooo YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon. I asked for a pork burrito, but they didn't have any pork, so that was disappointing. I settled for a chicken burrito which was very tasty and filling, but I found the shredded chicken to be too shredded. It was almost non-existent.  I also ordered an empanada with cheese and chicken which was the best. It was a little hard to find a place to sit because the tables were dirty. Perhaps they were short staffed that day. The Mr. was still hungry after his fish taco and chorizo burrito. He wasn't as pleased as I was with the meal. I'd definitely return for the empanada."}
{"text":"Sabor is great. They have a good variety of modern latin food. There are a few locations around the Charlotte area, the one in Indian Trail and the one up by the Novant hospital (formerly Presby main) are both better than this Pineville location as far as cleanliness and service but the food has been consistently great at all of them. They have a good selection of beverages including domestic and imported beers and basic mixed drinks (mojitos, margaritas, etc.). The sauces are really good as well but the food is already flavorful so you may find them unnecessary. I especially like that they have outlets with USB plug in at each table and booth and it's that kind of extra thought that brings me to 5 stars rather than just 4. I definitely recommend trying whichever Sabor is closest to you as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I am SOOO excited that there is a location so close to my house now!!  I work close to the Hawthorne location and always find myself wanting Sabor when I am home!  This location is brand new, so there is a definite newness feel when you visit. Compared to other locations, it is not (yet) packed full of people and the food takes a little longer to come out (I assue this is because they are making food to order).  I could tell that the staff seemed a little overwhelmed, which lead to them being less friendly than they could have been but again, this all comes with the territory of being a brand new restaurant. 

The shredded chicken is the best thing you can eat here- in a burrito, in a taco, on nachos- whatever floats your boat.  Their guac is also to die for- it is so creamy and is just perfection. My husband is obsessed with their nachos.  They are GIGANTIC and could probably feed a family of four easily (of course he finishes them off solo). I forsee a TON of visits in our future now that they are so close to home!!!

On a mom note, they have high chairs available and a kids menu that has a fair amount of options compared to other places.  Drink of choice is a smaller fountain drink, so if you need milk for your little one, bring your own.  My toddler was also losing his mind while we were there and they did not bat an eyelash or make us feel unwelcomed :)"}
{"text":"SO YUMMY! This tastes like street food, so it's a little greasy, but it easily beats out all the popular chain Mexican places.  I've had a burrito, an empanada, a quesadilla, and churros (all on separate occasions) and have nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"INSANE tacos! We chose the americano tacos with quac on the side. Sabor never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"Fast casual tacos. Taco Tuesday for a $1 is a great deal but even at $3 every other day it is a real value. Pretty fast service. This is a great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner. This new location is a little hidden but worth finding. Still love the Hawthorne location best but you'll get a really good meal for the money at any of their locations."}
{"text":"Honestly I expected a lot more from this restaurant due to rave reviews of the others in the area. I ordered a burrito with steak and the quinoa brown rice. It was obvious the steak wasn't super fresh; it was kind of cold. The burrito, although super large, didn't have too much flavor and the quinoa brown rice was pretty unappetizing. The dining area was pretty dirty too, tables had food all over them and hadn't been cleaned for a while. I would  give this another try and order something different but until then the 2 stars stands."}
{"text":"The staff at all locations are very accommodating and helpful. There are a few options for vegetarians and vegans, but the tofu ranchero is the best. It's a huge portion and the ingredients seem fresh. The chips and salsa are excellent and truly make it superior to all of the local competition."}
{"text":"First time. Tried empanadas, authentic tacos, guacamole and chips, and a quesadilla. The quesadilla was ok. Everything else was bland and uninteresting. I had high hopes but was disappointed. I'll give it another try just in case I caught them on a bad night."}
{"text":"I LOVE this Sabor! It's very clean, the employees are friendly and helpful, and the food comes out fast and it's always delicious! I don't live close to this side of town but whenever I'm out here this place is always my first choice."}
