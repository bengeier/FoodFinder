{"text":"Great little place. The owner is super friendly, and the food is fantastic.

They l have lots of pastries both savory and sweet that you can grab and go. Great for breakfast and in the go lunches. Lots of baklava options as well.

I'll be returning often!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick Sunday lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the array of menu and bakery options at this quaint and small cafe. We ordered the beef shish kebab and kippeh wraps and both were excellent and only $6.50 each. The owner was so sweet and even gave us little desserts at the end of our meal- mini baklava and a Turkish delight. We also ordered a baklava and several savoury pastries to go. The baklava is to die for and not too sweet- delicious.

From reading the other reviews, we'll have to return again for the falafel and chicken wraps. Definitely a quaint place with an authentic, small-town feel... we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't had much luck with Middle East food in Toronto, but this place restored my faith. The sandwich was delicious, the service was awesome, and the folded news papers on the table made me wish I could stay longer and relax. This place was the most pleasant surprise I have had in a while."}
{"text":"Very nice unique place - a good place to relax.  For a small cafe they have a very wide variety of treats and middle eastern snacks also a very small \"grocery\" section (ie- a few shelves) with some decent finds (ie-good place to get zataar).  The prices are really low and the owner and staff are super friendly and helpful.  kebobs are solid and healthy.  The \"blood of pigeon\" is also pretty cool and different.  As far as cafes go, this place scores high."}
{"text":"Just got back from having a chicken kebob wrap. It was so fresh and so clean, clean.

I just realized all their menu items are taxes in. 5 bucks for a deliciously sort of healthy meaty wrap? yes plulease."}
{"text":"My favourite place for falafel sandwich. Fresh ingredients prepared with care. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delightful place serving wholesome, delicious middle eastern food.  There is something unique about the falafel and chicken wraps that I have yet to experience at any other Toronto restaurant. The mint tea was also amazing. 

Definitely coming back to try  the whole menu."}
{"text":"Easiest 5 stars ever! I used to live in the area and had lunch at Arabesque at least once a week. Now I'm a bit further away but try to stop in when I can to have their amazing falafel. Ingredients are so fresh and the flavours blend nicely together. There's just enough of everything in the sandwich. The tea and coffee are both great. Friendly staff. Get there! It's one of the city's best kept little gems!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a million times and finally popped in to try it. Warm and inviting environment, filled with obvious regulars at lunch time. I ordered a falafel which was insanely cheap, only $4 (tax included)! I assumed this meant it would be quite small, so I got one of their sumptuous looking $3 caramel baklava from their dessert display. To my surprise the falafel was quite large! Fresh falafel patties, lettuce, tomato, black olives and garlicky tzatziki. The best part was that there were no raw onions like so many places have. It was perfectly balanced with the salty black olives. Probably the best falafel I've ever had! The baklava was fantastic too, next time I will probably get the bite sized ones they sell for just $1. Safe to say I will be back to try the rest of the menu, if I can resist another falafel!"}
{"text":"The falafel is great, especially for its price, and it feels more healthy and homemade than the usual deep fried and filled with sauce falafel from other places. Like the difference between a healthy salad and a caesar salad drenched in salad dressing and croutons. If you want a small after dessert snack, get the turkish delight sandwiched between two biscuits. The baklava is average, brought from Arz, but the fact that I can buy it so near me is a plus. It'll fill my cravings in between my trips to the good stuff in Scarborough."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to come for a coffee and falafel sandwich. I always want to try something new from the menu but I can resist the falafel...it's the best! 

I recommend getting the Arabesque coffee which is made with cardamom. It comes on a cute little tray and they will give you a sweet treat with whatever you order..the owner is so kind and generous.

It's very relaxing inside..the tables have little sections of the newspaper carefully laid out for your reading pleasure and there is always soft instrumental music playing. Everyone speaks quietly in here, even the cute yellow songbird In the cage on top of the drink fridge. Feels like an escape from busy College street....a perfect little oasis."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty dishes and pastries in a relaxed environment, and friendly conversations with the owner, who is a very pleasant gentleman. I would have lunch here everyday if I could. 

It's just too bad they're not open into the evenings otherwise I would come here far more often than I already do. 

The prices are very reasonable, and very much distinguishes itself from the hectic fast food-type Middle-Eastern places we so often see in Toronto."}
{"text":"I  am also guilty of living in this neighbourhood for 4 years and checking out Arabesque for the first time last month. But there is no looking back! This place is awesome. Prices are amazing, and they clearly take their time to cook, prepare, and deliver your food to your table - and if you order a app, sandwich, and dessert, they bring them out one after the other! Adorable. All the sandwiches are fresh, healthy tasting, and delicious. Complete with a cool older behind the counter who stopped me when I tried to order both a chicken shawarma and a Turkish style pizza - \"That's too much food for you\" (haha! and he was right, I was full after the sandwich). If you live in the area, get there! Support!"}
{"text":"Local charm, big windows with natural light snuggle up with their pigeon blood (tea) and snack on a Turkish sandwich or pastry baklava. No hipsters or wifi in this charming spot, your greeted with the smile of the owner, the newspaper and classical / jazz music. I can wait to come back and read a book here on a rainy day."}
{"text":"Best affordable fresh  falafel in town quiet and peaceful a good spot to read love it"}
{"text":"I have been living a less than five-minute walk from this place for over four years, but missed out on it for about half of that time. It is no secret that Toronto has an abundance of Middle-Eastern cuisine, but that is no excuse to have waited so long to go and have a falafel at Arabesque.

And unfortunately, that is pretty much all I have had. Blame the convenient nature of the dish itself, or the delicious nature of the way that he makes it, but whenever I get in there, it (my need for a falafel) overcomes me. The sauce has a particular tang to it, which is unique from most others I've tried, and I think is the result of a lemon-infused hummus. It also has black olives on it, which I'm pretty sure are not typical of every falafel joint, but I can't even remember, because I haven't- seriously- had one from anywhere else in so long. Oh, and did I mention that they are only $3.50? To get so full on less than five dollars is nothing short of miraculous.

The first time I went in there, the very kind and gracious owner offered me a free piece of Baklava with my meal; it was also delicious (ok, so I have also tried that), and I was won over by the taste and the gesture. The coffee is also exceptional, flavoured with Cardamom and always longed-for at that time of morning when Starbucks is the only place open."}
{"text":"This place is an oasis in the city.  It's got a chill vibe and quality food at an amazing price.  The owner is a gem and you can tell he cares about his food and his service.  I usually get the falafel. For $4 it's a steal and easily one of the best falafel sandwiches in the city.  Their espresso is amazing, and their sweets counter is to die for.  The baklavas makes a tasty dessert and are a must try- especially the caramel baklava.  If you are in the hood check this place out,  but make sure you check the hours first."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Looks unassuming from the outside,  but worth the visit. Extremely reasonably priced and authentic. Falafel was one of the freshest I've ever had. Baklava and spinach pie were also great. I also had a cardamom latte which i highly recommend. The owner is really kind and sweet. There are tables to eat at, not just a take out place."}
{"text":"Friendly service with a tasty \"Blood of the Pigeon\" tea and a cozy living room style environment. Baklava is very tasty. Excellent prices for very filling sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love lunch. I love lunch more than anyone I know, and I'll be willing to risk my life for a delicious yet cheap lunch for as long as I shall live. That is my solemn vow. 

Good luck finding a better deal to taste ratio at another lunch spot in Toronto. For $7 I got one of the best falafel wraps and a small fizzy water. Olives, fresh veggies and clean tasting falafel make this sandwich really remarkable, add hot sauce and you have a winner. Nay, The winner. 

The place itself is so cute, too. Each little table with a newspaper to make your stay more enjoyable and a lovely mural outside. Beauty. 

PEPPER PROPS to Kent P! Thank you for showing me the light. You're a true Pepper Pal. I can't even imagine how much me saying Pepper Pal is annoying you. Pepper hair don't care."}
{"text":"Hakim is just the sweetest! Thanks for being so kind to us in your caf√© today! Your food is fantastic and you make the experience so special! Shookran!"}
