{"text":"Amazing food, you have to try it! Chicken shawarma poutine is a must try. First time here but definitely not last. Great customer service & good clean environment."}
{"text":"Excellent Shawarma. Had a large and the veggies were crisp with great flavour on the chicken and sauces. The place is spotless and I love that the server washed his hands before making my order. I will have to try one of the platters next time as they look amazing, it looks like they fry the Falafels fresh to order, no microwaves yay! Seriously give these guys a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok..Have you had donair poutine before? Well this is the place to go! If you like crispy fries smothered in cheese and sauce this place is great....but if you want to dump a huge pile of donair or chicken shawarma on it and all the fixings this is definitely the place for you. For under $10 this is a full meal that will warm you up and make you smile. All i get on mine is extra sweet sauce....not a veggie fan lol. 
The donair is good as well.
Don't pass it up!
Friendly owner as well. 
The only down side is it's a little understaffed so there could be a small wait. Worth it though. For lunch call ahead and order for pick up!"}
{"text":"Got here by accident while looking for something to eat. 
Best shawarma in Canada!!!!"}
{"text":"Yess, they have Pickled turnips and good thin wrap bread, and shwarma poutine!"}
{"text":"We came in at an hour before closing but they were still very accommodating. Excellent food, great customer service. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference a second visit makes! I went during a busy lunch rush and everything was fresh and delicious! The portions are huge and you get your bang for your buck here. When the food is this good, it's nice to have extras for later. The chicken on my poutine had so much more flavor this time.
We also ordered a tawouk platter, and I cannot stop raving about how fluffy and enjoyable the rice was. I'm not sure what they put in it, but I will definitely be back for more. The chicken skewers were made to order and were nice and juicy. Everything on the platter was tasty.

Glad I gave this another try, as it's now one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recently bought over and is amazing. My experience has always been great here. Not only is their food excellent but their service exceeds anything else I have experienced. There was a mix up in my order and the owner came to my husband's auto shop where I was to drop off my fixed order. This is definitely a family owned business that deserves to be supported as they clearly put their heart and soul into their business"}
{"text":"My friend Riley told me about a really awesome Shawarma place on Barlow that I just HAD to try out. I wasn't super excited, as I thought I was not much of a Shawarma fan. I am always questioning what that hanging meat is, and a lot of Shawarma places aren't super clean.
Well, on my friend's advice, I ordered a large Beef pita. Also on his advice, I got the pickled turnips ( which sounded odd........), and the sweet sauce, along with several other toppings. I ordered three falafels, which were made fresh for me in a matter of a few minutes. Without me even asking!
The wrap was absolutely delicious. The meat is high quality and super tasty, and the ingredients are really fresh. The portions of meat and toppings are generous, too. The turnips are soooooo good! And the fresh falafels- amazing as well!!
And yes, the place was very clean. Even the bathroom was clean.

The service was super friendly as well.
This place will do well! I just wish it was closer to my house and my work!
I can't wait to go back and try the chicken skewers!
Awesome job Shawarma Barlow!"}
{"text":"Had the donair poutine and it was the best thing I've ever had! Straight up my new favourite poutine!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a shot through \"Skip the dishes\" on Monday night because I was exhausted and just didn't have the energy to make supper and all I have to say is WOW! I've eaten a fair amount of donairs and this one was definitely on the top of the list for me. I ordered a trio combo which included a beef donair, garlic potatoes, and a drink for a very fair price. The donair meat was perfectly seasoned and very juicy, vegetables were crisp and fresh, and the wrap was warm and soft with a little bit of crunch on the outside just how I like it, not to mention their sweet sauce is amazing. I will for sure be coming here when I have a donair craving!"}
{"text":"*** GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE***

If you are visit Calgary or live in Calgary, then it is a must go place. I love food and I'm really picky with my food. This place has food that can satisfy anyone. Delicious food. Not so spice or too sweet, it's just perfect. 

Beside food, the owner of the place it self serve food and makes. He gives his best in customer service. If you visit the place ask for the owner. Man has magic hand when it come to donairs and poutine. 

Sometime when u come for work in Calgary, I always stop for some poutine. 

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I actually had been intending on going to kings for some wor wonton but they moved so I figured I'd might as well try a shawarma. The staff are friendly the setting is great and the food is fantastic. Whenever I'm in the area I will be definitely stopping in more frequently."}
{"text":"The poutine is to die for here... I have been a repeat customer! Same amazing experience everytime!"}
{"text":"Great Shawarma came in to get war wonton next door but was closed so tried  Shawarma Barlow I will admit I am glad kings was closed   Best surprise I had in a long. Time great food good prices and the selection was great.   The staff are friendly and helpful to get you on the right track if your not sure what to order. 

Bravo"}
{"text":"The best most authentic Jordanian shawarma! The owner is super friendly and will always let you taste before you buy. Your satisfaction is their number 1 priority!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Arguably the best I have had in Calgary. Friendly, clean, and not too loud."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Definetly recommend this place for shawarmas, falafel, and lots of other delicious Mediterranean options."}
{"text":"I've picked up some lunch here a few times and it's fantastic every time. Staff is friendly, restaurant is clean, and the shawarma is fantastic. Will definitely be back. Maybe next time I'll try the poutine that everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma, the staff regularly greet their regulars. They have a weird bread type skin with their pita that is amazing. Chicken tawouk cooked fresh with great marination and flavour. 

I'm only here for the weekend but I'll definitely come back before i leave. The outer bread skin thing (my technical term) is so unique and yummy it really brings it together."}
{"text":"My friends told me this is the only place that they get shawarma from and I don't blame them it's really good. The most impressive thing is that they actually make falafel right in front of you not re deep fry it. The falafel had the perfect crunch and wasn't too dry like they some times can be.
I will return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic falafels, made fresh to order. The staff is also really friendly and even offered a free sample of falafel to the group behind us who had never tried it before. I would highly recommend this place. Easily one of the best falafel and shawarma places in town."}
{"text":"Awesome Jordanian authentic spices, generous servings, friendly service, clean. I have found nothing as good in Saudi, or in Texas.  The shawarma is excellent."}
{"text":"Ordered the shawarma platter and falafel through Skip the Dishes and am very satisfied. Food is very flavourful and fresh. And the falafel is to die for!!! Literally the best falafel I have ever had! Can't wait to get more!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience today. I'd read at somebody's blog about how amazing the poutine is, so I ordered the chicken shawarma poutine. Now note that although this place does pride itself on authentic Lebanese food - food that I do look forward to trying - this ain't authentic. It's Canadian- Lebanese fusion. But it's also EFFING DELICIOUS. You can get any shawarma topping you care for on top; I just got garlic sauce, tahini, and spicy sauce because I thought pickled turnip and such would make this flavour bomb too messy, and my instincts were very correct. It was completely delicious- the marriage of fresh fries, curds, perfect gravy and they the DELICIOUS chicken and sauces- it was just fantastic and a very good price, less than $10 for more than I could finish.

Mohammed was the young man who ably served me and as I was the only customer we chatted a lot- great person!"}
{"text":"After working in Calgary for 7 years eating a lot of Shawarma for lunch, I must say this place is top shelf! Wraps are grilled perfectly to minimize the mess. Lamb and chicken shawarma were great. Friendly owner who appreciates your business. Do yourself a favour and stop by today."}
{"text":"Absolutely first rate.   We discovered it a couple days ago and have been here twice already.  It's addictive.  Tabouli salad is unbelievable.   Both chicken shawarma platter and lamb shawarma platter are so good I wanted to lick my plate after.   We will be back."}
{"text":"What a joke of a restaurant!  We ordered 3 donairs from skip the dishes - Order was completely wrong, cold, and even their baklava was gross!  Word to the wise DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE EVER!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and although the food has been good, the service is slow, and the staff are disorganized."}
{"text":"Average at best.

Food is similar to most arab sandwich places within a 10 mile radius but the thing that will bring me back is the shawarma poutine, amazing.  If you go in for anything, I say try the shawarma poutine, you have never had anything like it.

I thought the sandwich was ok, nothing stood out to me that it was better than Jerusalem shawarma because they do an excellent sandwich, but for the location I guess its better than what else is around.

Guys running the place were nice enough but found the service a little slow for lunch. Prices are the same as other places offering the same food.

Plenty of seating and beverage selections, even offer a special of the day. 

Will definitely come back for the poutine shawarma if in the area."}
