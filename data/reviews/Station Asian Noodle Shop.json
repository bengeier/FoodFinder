{"text":"I have been here one time during dinner and thought it was only okay, but decided to come by for lunch with my bro and his gf, and mine. The experience I'd say is pretty bad!   They have a huge menu list with a bunch of specials and combos for decent price...Lots of nice pictures showing what the food looks like and stuff...That was the good! Here comes the bad...  My bro orders the beef & mushroom with rice combo...As we all ordered a combo, it comes with soup, drink, and app. My bro did not enjoy his meal at all, and did not finish his meal...  My bro's gf got the spicy fish dumpling with udon noodles soup...No noodles in there, but the server got one later for her...Her soup was bland, and the dumpling was not good.  My gf got the honey beef tenderloin with rice. The flavour is there, and the tenderloin was tender, BUT it was ULTRA...ULTRA....ULTRA...Rubbery and took forever to chew and swallow.  I ordered the 'curry crab' with rice...Remember all the nice pictures? Well let's just say the crab picture was very misleading...It shows a full crab picture with legs and body and everything...When it arrived after all of them was basically finishing up their meals, I get mine finally, b/c the cook forgot to cook it, Or the server forgot to put that in the order to the cook. This crab was a bunch of little crab body...Smaller than blue crab body! I gave it a try, and the meat was UBER soggy! After that small nibble, I gave it up...  The server came back and asked if we wanted to wrap our stuff, and we all said no. The soup was the only thing that was good. My bro decided that the service was atrocious and decided to stiff the server, but I decided to give some tip even for the awful service...But we will NEVER EVVVEERRRR dine here again..."}
{"text":"I am giving only one star because I am not able to not give no star, or negative stars.   Food is mediocre at best and the service is absolutely horrible and I will never go back to this restaurant again.    They have an item on the menu where the food comes w/ spaghetti.  Those who normally dine at Chinese restaurant knows that if you get spaghetti instead of plain rice with your meal normally you would have to add money for the upgrade.  That's understandable.  I asked if I can switch my spaghetti to plain rice and they told me I'd have to add a $1.  What!?!?  Then i upgraded my drink to the Green Bean drink w/ Ice cream and I asked for no ice to go.  They made a mistake and gave the drink to me in a glass cup for dine in.  I asked for them to switch it into a plastic cup and you can hear the 2 servers on the side referring us to troublesome and how we were wasting their time.   The drink only filled half the cup.  I was so disgusted I didn't even take the drink and left it there.  Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Favourite place. Non busy Splendid China mall has plenty of parking space. Food is good, price is just a bit higher than the average casual restaurants, but still not bad.  Have lots of variety drinks included in the meal. But deserts are always too sweet."}
{"text":"I have the take out but never have the sit in dinner.  On a Thursday night not too much traffic here.  I order a combo that includes a shark fin soup and Taiwanese stir fry.  The soup tastes like shark fin.  I can see the restaurant is selling cans of shark fin soup at the counter.  The Taiwanese stir fry although taste good but it is not the real Taiwanese stir fry.  IAnother combo is red date soup, chestnut chicken in a hot bowl and comes with a drink.  The red date soup comes in a cup.  It tastes concentrated.  The chestnut is not too soft.  Both the chicken and chestnut do not have sauce soaped into them.  I do not know about other restaurants for the same chain but this one the sofa seats are so close to the table.  The restaurant definitely wants to squeeze in more people.  The bill comes for over $30.  For a HK style restaurant, it is not cheap."}
{"text":"Located in a somewhat new and semi-popular mall Splendid China lies this restaurant... if you can even call it a restaurant. This is my first review, and my experience at this restaurant has driven me to create an account and get typing.  First things first. I arrived at the restaurant with my family for lunch on 1/4/2015, a cold Sunday afternoon. The atmosphere was fairly quiet, not too many people talking. The loudest thing in the room would be the chef's cooking, as part of the kitchen is visible. We were seated to a table that was just cleaned, the tabletop still wet. The first thing that I noticed would be the table itself (photo included); it is a glass tabletop with grime on the side... the thought of eating on it wasn't too pleasing. We had to ask the waiter to bring napkins so that we could actually wipe the table ourselves. There were two waiters in the restaurant who were running about, attempting to take orders, and there was a man who I will assume to be the manager or boss who was assisting the waiters.  There were no utensils or water given upon being seated. -1 right there. They give you a piece of paper where you can write the orders you want, quantity, and what option you want with it. The option means what you want to come with the lunch set... for example, I ordered a Curry Chicken w/ Rice which came with either HK tea, Bubble Tea (I chose the Bubble Tea), or Soup for $6.50. The price wasn't that bad.  After ordering, the waiter brought three bowls of soup for our family (dad was working), and what struck me was the overwhelming smell of bleach. I could barely smell the fragrance of the soup... disgusting. I tasted some of the soup and was greeted with the flavor of pure salt... there was no taste of broth or anything of the sort. It seemed as though they put water into the soup to help boost the quantity of it. No vegetables or meat in the soup. At this point my mom asked for our dishes to have less salt in them because of our experience with the soup; she told a woman who was working the counter. The woman stayed at the counter and didn't bother telling the chefs.  Within 5 minutes of the soup coming came my dish: the Curry Chicken w/ Rice. The rice portion was fine, but it seemed too dry. Curry was alright; too much sauce however. I assumed it would be a Chinese curry, but it turned out to have an Indian sort-of twist to it... very spicy due to the amount of pepper. After eating some of the curry it was apparent that I needed water due to the spiciness of it that was burning my throat... the waiter brought 3 cups of water promptly. The smell of bleach was still apparent on the cup, so I avoided the water as much as I could.  Bubble tea came when we were halfway through our lunch. Way too much sugar, but a good portion of tapioca was inside the bubble tea. The table next to us ordered a Mango-flavored bubble tea; the waiter brought normal bubble tea and said it was Mango. They also ordered honey-water and found a rock inside the cup. How does that even happen?  To finish the meal off I drank some of the water. Big mistake. When standing up and preparing to leave, it was apparent that not many people liked the food as well; most of the tables that were finished still had food on the plate.   On the drive home all I could taste was bleach in my mouth... when I got home I rinsed out my mouth and tried to avoid throwing up.  Avoid Station Asia if you can. Don't be tempted by the somewhat low pricing... you can get better at Pacific Mall for the same price which is across the street."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here.  They have various combos for less than 10 dollars, which include soup, an appetizer, the main dish, dessert and a bubble tea.  (I think you have to add $1 -$2 for the bubble tea now).  They have at least 100 things on the menu to choose from and are always changing the specials.  I had a rice noodle, with chicken and pickled cabbage.  It was quite good, a bit too much grease, but still very tasty.  It came with a soup and shredded chicken as an appetizer.  The bubble tea is quite consistent, and good as well.  For dessert, it is like a peach-flavoured jello.  Not really sure what the English translation is, but in China, they used to make it from a turtle shell.    The service though leaves much to be desired.  It's not that they intentionally do it, they just don't really care.    But for the price, you can't really ask for much.  You can easily eat for under 12-13$ a person (including tax/tip).  It's never very busy though, but hopefully it will be around for a while."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant in the past many times and I have always felt that they are somewhat \"stand out\" from the crowds.  Until today that I had experience unfriendly customer service.  This will probably my last time visiting here. My daughter picked up a few sugar bags to shake.  A waiter came by immediately and took the sugar container away with about 10 bags of sugar in them.  He also told us not to play with sugar.  This is the very first time I encountered this, and I gave a very bad look to the waiter as he turned back and starring at us."}
{"text":"This belongs to the same restaurant owner as the Station Asian in Market Village. Therefore they have the same menu and the same prices. But I have better experience here then at Market Village.  I went there around lunch time. The place is not too busy. They have all day menu either with the main course (from $6.99) or as a combo which comes with soup, appetitizer and a drink for $2 extra.  The thing I like it here is the drink, they have a great selections of cold drinks that includes special Taiwanese drinks without extra charges.  I decided on having the curry fish fillet and the iced milk tea with grass jello.  The soup is ok, but has some Chinese herbs inside...so that's is quite personally if you use to that taste or not.  The appetitizer is pickled giner with octopus (they don't like octopus in their nature form, so no need to worry).   I really enjoy the curry fish fillet with rice though, there are tons of green and red pepper, the fish is the best part since they DID not deep fried that in flour coating.. I can really taste the texture of the fish and it taste fresh!  The drink I treated that as a dessert.. yes it is as fattening as a dessert.. : ) . The tea is really creamy.......but I love grass jello.... I wish there are more in that!  The waitstaffs were talking really loud, discussing their own personal life while I were eating.......  BTW, if you come at night, the combos does includes a dessert for free.... I wondering why not during lunch??  They accepts Mastercard, Visa and cash."}
