{"text":"My finance and parents decided to dine here because we're thinking of holding our wedding reception in the Waterside Inn (the hotel in which Breakwater is situated).  My family and I have eaten here before, and the food had always been incredible.  I have to say, though, I was a bit put off by my most recent visit.  We ordered from the prix fixe menu, and the varieties sounded delicious.  My mother and I ordered the same salad, and to our dismay, both of our salads arrived with no dressing.  After the waiter suggested that it was \"lightly dressed\" (it wasn't), he brought out some dressing for us.  For our entree, three of the four of us ordered the scallops.  The flavours were good, however the cleaning of the scallops was careless; all three of us experienced a gritty texture in our food (perhaps sand).  The dessert, on the other hand, was very tasty.  I don't want to jump to conclusions, however we never had these kinds of disappointments at the Breakwater with the previous executive chef.  I worry that the new executive chef (who was the previous sous chef) may not have the same attention to detail and quality control."}
{"text":"Took my honey out for Valentines and the bill couldn't have come sooner. I know everyone orders wine so that is probably why we were ignored but it is Valentines and we just wanted a good evening. Salty steak, no pepper offered for my steak. No lemon for honeys salmon. Cold salmon, the desert was supposed to have macaroons but they forgot ours. Missing cranberry juice until we ask again. Order Wine to get good service. Even paying was painful. The chase Paymentech was dialing out.... Hey the Amuse Bouche and bread were amazing though. It isn't just us, when I was getting my jacket this other couple was giving the manager a piece of their mind about the staff. Apparently this was their 3rd try. Maybe management has changed because this is supposed to be the best in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I feel bad for Giselle's experience at this restaurant because I love this place a lot! It is very high-end fine dine restaurant. I have to admit that I only visit this place once a year with my entertainment book coupon at this stage of my life. It does motivate me to be more ambitious in my career every time after dinning there.   I've been here one time with my extended family and two times with my boyfriend for our very special days (usually a birthday or anniversary). None of us are vegetarian, so we've ordered rack of lamb, filet mignon, fish etc. All of the dishes taste really good! None of us were disappointed. The last time I was there, we ordered the lobster bisque, and they first placed the soup dish, and then pour the soup out from a silver tea pot in front of you, it was a very British experience, I felt so spoiled. Between your appetizer and main dish, they will bring up sorbet to cleanse your palate before the next course.   Finally, they have excellent artisan bread as well. I don't think I have ordered their dessert because I'm usually too full by then.   It's best to go on a warmer day so you can take a walk around the area as there are quite a few interesting shops nearby. It is also very romantic to take a walk along the lake towards the pier."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is fast and friendly. Location is amazing. I had the baked Brie as a starter, fish & chips as my entree and an excellent cappuccino.,"}
{"text":"Wasn't overly excited with the steak as most weren't in our party. There are much better restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"Love the personalized service !! Staff are very attentive !! Chef Adrian tries to keep the menu seasonal & fresh.  If you are hankering for a non standard item if the kitchen has the ingredients & they aren't to busy ask they'll usually make it for you"}
{"text":"Just had their Sunday brunch and it was wonderful. Started with delicious Mimosas and it only got better from there. Nice selection of food on their Brunch Menu. From Waffles to a Omlette Bar, to assorted cheeses, coldcuts, Roastbeef cut to your liking, various vegetable and vegan dishes as well. Assorted buns, rolls, breads, flatbreads, pitas, and croissants. Anything you want, they have. The service was exemplary, and whenever we finished our meal, they cleaned the table right away. Very attentive, always asking if we want tea, coffee, juice or another drink. Desserts were lovely as well. Great view of the harbour! Can't say enough about this place and how well it is run. Run, don't walk there. It will be worth the burned calories! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Members of my extended family love this restaurant so I found myself dining here with family in March. I ordered the vegetarian tasting plate, one of two vegetarian entree options (the other was a mushroom risotto), and found it disappointing.  The vegetarian tasting plate was a strange assortment of items. A tiny bowl of olives seemed out of place and thoughtless (it's not difficult to open a jar of mixed olives), and the plate was too heavy on fried dumplings (one mushroom-potato bitterball with a mushy centre, and two zucchini dumplings). A small pile of lentils and squash had a nice earthy flavour but the lentils were crunchy (obviously undercooked). Rounding out the tasting plate, a slice of tomato topped with mozzarella and basil was nothing special.  While my party enjoyed amuse-bouches, I got nothing after telling the waiter I was vegetarian. And this is despite calling the restaurant the previous night to inquire into vegetarian options and alert them I'd be dining there. For a restaurant boasting all kinds of fine-dining awards, you'd think their kitchen could've assembled a vegetarian amuse-bouche for me. Instead I got persona non grata treatment. This impression was reinforced when I emailed the restaurant to give them polite feedback on the veg tasting plate and received no reply."}
{"text":"We decided to enjoy our Christmas dinner here. $65 per person for a buffet that checked all the boxes. With wine, taxes, and gratuities expect to pay $100 per person. The buffet included all kinds of meat and fish, and covered all tastes and desires. Each dish or cut of meat was superbly prepared and presented. The dessert table was a delight in itself.  The ambiance was very pleasant, with families at well set tables all having a great time. Quiet and seasonal music played and the wait staff worked impeccably to ensure our evening was perfect. All the front of house staff were in good spirits. We have dined here before, and it only gets better."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch, price was $32.95 per person. There was a very small selection of breakfast items with an omelet station and a selection of cakes for dessert. A third of the choices were salads and the rest are your regular breakfast items (sausages, bacon, bread, etc). There were also orange juice and what looks like grape juice. The omelet station allows you to pick ingredients and the omelet is made right away. I only had to wait 10 minutes before being served and it was quite tasty. But other than the omelet, everything else is mediocre. Considering the price, I definitely expected more.   As for service, I specifically asked for a window seat as it was my s/o and my anniversary celebration, but we were seated next to the corridor (even though I saw window seats that were empty), almost felt like it was a temporary table. It was most difficult to wave down a waiter and when we finally did, their customer service was below average. Overall, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel upstairs over the long weekend. Was able to try this restaurant a few times. I had the eggs Benedict, chicken supreme, and the seared tuna. The eggs Benedict and chicken supreme were easily two of the best things I've ever eaten. I will deffinitely be returning in the near future to enjoy both of these gems! Unbelievably Amazing food, Great atmosphere, Great service!! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"My 2nd visit to this lovely restaurant to celebrate our anniversary, the food was amazing and the service was great. They took special care with the dessert and we had a lovely time."}
{"text":"The first time we went here it was fantastic and 5 stars. They have a kids menu and the wait staff are excellent.   The second time we went for a mothers day dinner but were not informed that it was a set dinner. We did not like half of the food that they were serving but they did make us some Cesar salads instead. The main course tasted excellent but had a very small portion and walked away still hungry. The wait staff were excellent again but we did not like the food choice, the portions were way to Small and we were not informed of the set menu when we booked.  We do like the regular menu but would not go back with a set menu in place."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday afternoon, party of 7 including my GF's mother's 70th birthday party.  We had not planned on coming to Breakwater but were pleasantly surprised.   Staff was very friendly and attentive, the server worked with the kitchen to create a vegan meal for someone in our party.  Outdoor patio was very nice and comfortable.    I had the gnocchi w/ chicken and it was absolutely amazing.  One of the best entrees I've had in a few years.  Green salad was great too.  We had a 2007 Valpolicella red and it was excellent.  Great service, friendly and attentive staff, delicious food, good wine.  Well done."}
