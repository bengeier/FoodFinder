{"text":"Sinceramente al dueño ,  I'm very disappointed in salsitas. I came here years ago and remember a good experience. Good, flavorful tAcos de cabeza and good service.  Now, we waited in like at the drive through for fifteen minutes for two cars in front of us and once we got to the window it took about three minutes for them to even say hi and take our order. Aparte de eso, the tacos I got were a joke. I'm a Mexican chef from Guadalajara and cook the same meats you do. Asada carnitas pollo tripas y pastor. El pastor, dry. The pollo, ni pensé que era pollo. TripAs, las pedí doradas y nada. & carne asada the best known meat was nothing but a dry piece of meat, cooked well, but lacked tremendous seasoning and a flavor that would keep me coming back. I'm sorry salsitas pero les falta buen savor. I think the only reason you might succeed is because you're dealing with drunks during the off hours. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Service is decent. Will continue to choose this place over filiberto's any day of the week."}
{"text":"One late Saturday night, I came across this 24 hour joint. I proceeded to order the carne asada fries in the drive through, which ran me $9.50 with tax. Staff was friendly and had no issues giving me a couple extra sauces. The red sauce was probably a 1/10 for spiciness-very disappointing. The food was expectedly mediocre; the portion of fries was large, but the amount of meat, sour cream, and guacamole was less than generous. This was certainly not worth close to $10."}
{"text":"It's okay i got tacos and they needed maybe a little salt or something , the salsa wasn't all that either but the super nachos are bomb"}
{"text":"After limited success finding out about this place online, I figured I would just have to take the plunge and go.  Fortunately, they have a dining room in addition to a drive through, so I didn't have to make a forced decision to keep the drive through line moving.  I went for the dining room.  One thing that encouraged me to try this place was the big sign on the outside that says \"Licuados\" which is something I don't see on too many menus and which I absolutely love (it's kind of like a milk shake but I think the primary ingredients are milk and ice, not ice cream).  I ordered a milanesa torta (a sandwich with breaded skirt steak), a chicken gordita (sort of like a grilled sandwich bun stuffed kind of like a pita pocket with meat and other fillings), and, of course, a licuado....banana flavored, my favorite.  Size large of course lol.  The torta normally comes with chips and I ordered fries instead.  According to the menu, there was a $1.00 upcharge for the fries, and I was fine with that....until I glanced at my receipt and saw that I'd been charged $1.50.  The total price for my two sandwiches, fries, and licuado was something like $22.50.  I thought that was a bit high.  I can go to McDonald's and get a couple of plus-sized deluxe burgers, large fries, and a drink for about $16 bucks.  How was the food?  Well, the torta was somewhere between okay and not great.  The guacamole they put on it (comes with) had that chalky taste that guacamole gets...I'm not sure how, but it gets.  Not that it's spoiled, it just tastes chalky.  Not pleasant.  And the meat was inconsistent.....tender and delicious in some spots, rubber-band-gristly that I literally had to tear apart with my teeth in others.  The gordita was delicious; I have no complaints about that.  The fries were the skinny McDonald's kind, which I love, but about half of them were a little hard.  The licuado was heaven....and for $4.50, it should have been.  Probably a good thing, though, or I'd be buying them 2 or 3 times a day and be lactating in no time.  Will I go back?  Yeah.  They have a pretty extensive menu.  I want to try the chimichanga and the shrimp fajitas.  And more licuados.  I just probably won't go very often.  The pros:  The licuados, the gordita The cons: the Milanesa, the guacamole, and the high prices.  Oh, and the tables in the dining room are not comfortable for us plus-sized people."}
