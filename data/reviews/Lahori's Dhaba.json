{"text":"We ordered 4 takeout chicken items, which were just ok to barely edible. The biggest problem was how greasy everything was... We don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Good food. Had the chicken haandi and great service. Friendly staff. Small place. Good environment to eat with friends."}
{"text":"I know that indian and pakistani food is hot, but why can't restaurants learn to tone it down a bit.  I can tolerate some heat, but if a medium is too hot for me to eat, that is bad.  If you like hot food you probably will like the food.  Quality and flavor were otherwise good.  The portions were generous.  My wife got chicken tikka marsala, extra mild, she could not eat it but it was fine for me - good flavor.  Samosas were good, nice cardamom and cumin flavor.  No ambiance. now this normally does not bother me, in fact my idea of a good ethnic restaurant is great food and no ambiance.  However, minimal or no air conditioning would have made eating there unpleasant.  Try take out."}
{"text":"Maybe I just had a bad experience and should try it again, but this was super greasy. The Tika Masala curry was basically a greasy masala soup. I also got the fried rice and it was just dripping with oil.   Perhaps this is great for many, but not my cup of tea..."}
{"text":"We just had the worst chicken boti and tandoori chicken. This place was recommended to us today and so we decided to give it a try this evening  I don't know whose food is in the picture but it's  nothing like what we got    The chicken was super dry and burnt and had no flavor whatsoever. Scraggly limp piece s of lettuce. Wonder if it was leftover from lunch. Even the naan was chewy and stale    Will never go here again even if it is FREE"}
{"text":"I am not much of a fan of Indian or Pakistani food. My son brought me here and I conservatively ordered a vegetable fried rice thinking that it would be more agreeable for digestion. Was I surprised! The food was absolutely delicious! The spices used and the accompanying dressing were terrific. Our host was most helpful and pleasant. Must come back and try other items in the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I am a vegeterian and their matar paneer, veg fried rice, kheer in dessert is very tasty. Their kheer (rice pudding) tastes like rabri and is very rich in taste unlike normal kheer. A must try place in chandler, arizona."}
{"text":"One of the best Indo-Pakistan food in the Phoenix area. Their food is absolutely like homemade food and is amazingly delicious. The service is really good and the owner Nadeem speaks really sweet. Strongly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon given to me that was about to expire. I went 5 different times during their posted hour of operation to find the resterant closed. Sometimes signs where posted and some times no sign. One day I went earlier in day and sign said would be open at 5pm. I returned at 6p to locked doors and no one there. I went in on a Saturday at 1:30 (hours11a to 9 pm) a was told sorry but closed till 5pm. Finally, I arrived when the where open and serving. Every option I requested was no being served that day and settled for what was available. The food itself was good. As I had 3 groupon I returned and since my previous experience with lack of availability, I asked what was on the menu today. I was told anything on the menu. However, every thing I asked for was not being served. Once again I only had a choice of about 3 items. I gave 3 stars as the food was good. They need to have daily menu of offered foods not a menu where most of items are not being served. Perhaps a white board with what's available. It would be nice to have a more accurate hours of operation. Indian food is not my first choice and if I didn't have groupon I would not have returned after 2 attempts to eat there."}
{"text":"We came in a little after 5pm. We were the only ones there and it certainly doesn't look too appealing from the outside. Most of the really good places aren't.....  It was our first time there and we both were glad we went. Started with four Samosas. There were two of us and I would recommend one each too not get overloaded before the main course. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala with naan and an order of the Fried Rice (don't recall which one). Both were very good. As one of the other posts indicates, don't be in a hurry - they are not taking it from a pre-made pot. Definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"We have been to Lahori's Dhaba a few times and it has definitely been our favorite Pakistani restaurant! Everything we have tried have been delicious and worth the wait! We can definitely take the freshness! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite place. Food is awesome in taste and quality is very good. Biriyani is my all-time favorite dish and this is the BEST biriyani I had in USA. Lamb, beef and chicken dishes are equally awsome, well cooked, rich in flavor. All the dishes I tried reminds me of the food back home. I have never been in their restaurant in person as I am in California. My husband used to bring togo for me every weekend when he used to travel from Phoenix to California. He always talks about owner's friendly welcome. I am looking forward to travel to Phoenix sometime just to visit this place and eat"}
{"text":"Very good grilled food & fast service .hospitable & clean place .will go again to try more dishes"}
{"text":"Chicken Biryani was bad. Certainly not dum. Was sogging with chicken curry put on top."}
{"text":"Love that this is the only indian biryani place that emphasizes on making the food fresh. If it is not freshly made, they don't serve it. I love the integrity of the owner. Absolutely must try their biryani!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to discover this wonderful restaurant so close to my work.  I have dined here 3 times already and have had a delicious experience each time.  I have tried multiple dishes and they have all been extraordinary. It is easy to miss because of the location, but keep looking, it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"DO NOT come here unless you have at least 1.5 hours to wait to get your food. We came in when if wasn't busy but waited an hour before we just up and left. The couple who came before us had JUST gotten their food when we kindly asked them to just tell the owner we're cancelling our order. We left $6 for the can of Sprite and 2 bottles of water we had. The funny thing is the Indian family who came after us got their food first. The couple that was before us had an Indian guy so we think maybe they're racist. Plus we tried ordering a couple things including the masala but they said they were out. So in all fairness we don't know how to rate the taste of the food but everything else the 1 star holds."}
{"text":"I have to give five stars to Lahori's Dhaba because they have brought the real taste of Lahore from Pakistan. Food taste fresh and cooked well. Chicken Karhi was yummy, I loved the tandoori roti that is the roti you wanted to try. Loved the tandoori roti.  It is family owned restaurant, I did not expected great service but we liked their service. I have been to restaurant two times and we loved it. I book my order in advance so by the time I get to the restaurant with my family we do not have to wait for the food. I know Pakistani food takes long time to cook.   The second reason I am giving them five stars because they will take your order on the phone in advance if you are going to dine in the restaurant. Many that type of restaurants do not take pre orders on the phone for those who likes to dine in the restaurant.  I am hoping they will start breakfast in Lahori style soon on the weekend. My family love this place we will continue to eat here.   Good bye to other Pakistani restaurant, I have found my authentic Lahori place in Chandler for Lahori food called Lahori Dhaba.  Lahori Dhaba, you ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"Genuine Pakistani food- soooooo delicious! Very flavorful, fresh, and spicy (although not too spicy). My husband is from Pakistan, and we have been getting several orders a week from here for awhile now. We call ahead and pick up several dishes to last us through the week. My favorite are the haleem and biryani. My husband loves the nihari and chicken karahi. Highly recommend! You week not be disappointed- and will be coming back for more delicious food."}
{"text":"Very good example of authentic Indian and Pakistani food. Everything was made fresh to order and the owner is fantastic. Small place with only 7 tables! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the weirdest review footer me to write.  We ordered three items.  None of them tasted as they should. None seemed authentic Pakistani.  One item labeled spicy was not. Another labeled mild was quite spicy.  Yet we still liked the food! It may not be authentic by south Asian standards but putting that aside it was good food.  Also no washrooms!"}
{"text":"Authentic pakistani food, small family owned place which is the beauty of it. try chapli kabab! Very reasonably priced, Need to have better signage, its hard to find this place when its dark, well worth the trip to this side of town."}
{"text":"Lahoris Dhaba's is the best Indian Pakistani food I've ever had. You can trust any place where The Owner and his wife are the ones making the food in the kitchen. Very tasty and honestly the best in all the valley."}
{"text":"Great Food!!! & Friendly Service  From the Tea to the Pulao, each and everything I have tried till date nothing has disappointed me. And trust me I have tried a lot of items already due to being a foodie. Everything reminds me of home, the authenticity of the taste of the food cooked here is unbelievable. Freshly made is the biggest secret. It takes a while but you will not be disappointed with what you get after the wait. The only restaurant in the valley to make you feel like you are back home. The most authentic tasting Indo-Pak restaurant. Great Work!!!  Keep it Up!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have excellent food and are extremely polite. Authentic Desi food in Chandler. You have to try their samosas. They are melt in your mouth perfect. Haleem is excellent and in fact all items on the menu are excellent."}
{"text":"Good authentic tasting food. They take time to prepare but that is because their preparation is fresh and different for different style of curries. The owner is friendly."}
{"text":"This was the worst indian food we've ever had. Hands down. Greasy, strange colored chicken, yucky sauces, and tasteless samosa. Definitely will never come back, and I encourage you to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful surprise! We thought initially it was an Indian restaurant but when the food arrived we realized that the spices were different and yet fantastically delicious. We devoured everything, and only at the end did the owner educate us that the restaurant is actually Pakistani.  It felt like we had stumbled across a private home with a wonderful family willing to cook us a generous mouthwatering dinner. I can only say that if you can appreciate foods that are found in this region of the world you will come to love the special little restaurant, please give it a try!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW, this place needs to be in its own category when it comes to Indo-Pak Cuisine. I've come back several times and have driven 45 min just to have their Chicken Biryani. The Pakoras are very light and their Tandoori Chicken is not extremely spicy or over powered with red tandoori sauce. I just had the Chicken Karahi last night which was perfect with Naan. I always call ahead because its best for takeout. Great food takes time and they take their time to make sure it is prepared adequately. I promise its worth the wait. The restaurant is quaint and comforting, almost as if you are coming over for family dinner. The portions are generous and customer service is always great. I always try to have something new but the Chicken Biryani is a MUST to accompany any dish here. 5 stars because the food is consistently Amazing, they are clean, offer great service, portions are generous and prices just cant be beat! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for ind-pak food. Great service. They have authentic ..and I mean authentic cuisines.. No compromise on taste and quality. Try out the chicken biryani."}
{"text":"Waited 1.5 hours for a to go order when they had said it would take 45 minutes. They kept saying that the food will be ready in 5 minutes every 10 minutes. Horrible experience. Kids had to stay up till 10 pm to have dinner."}
{"text":"They actually listened to my feedback and revamp the menu and improve the service : ) I will be back here for my fav curry dish and try more dishes!  Their curry dish is very unique! Nothing like the Indian curry nor the Chinese, nor the Japanese, nor the Thai curry. Their spice is out of this world!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. We ordered takeout and when I arrived (on a Tuesday at 6pm) the place was completely EMPTY...which I found to be strange. The restaurant nextdoor (Chou's), however, was packed and patrons were hanging around outside. There were no open parking spots close to the door and the parking lot was very dimly lit. Since I was alone, this made me feel uneasy walking to and from my car. I mentioned this to the owner and he casually agreed; seemed accepting of it as \"the way it is\".   Now about the food: it was delicious! Flavorful, perfectly spiced and the chicken was incredibly tender. We did find the quantity a bit insufficient for the price, though. Just a few small pieces of chicken in each entree.   I have mixed feelings on returning again. I will probably try other Indian restaurants in the area first."}
{"text":"This place needs a five star   Go there and give them time to cook for you and I think you will be very happy   They close at 2:30 pm after lunch it is 3:42 pm and we just left   They did not close because we where there   As a customer o appreciate that very much   Whatever I asked for they provided that   Meat or vegetarian dishes I was happy   Nihari, One Meat dish, Matter Paneer, Daal Tadka Naan   Not bad   We ate and also asked them to pack for us   Very important for me to mention this   Yesterday they where closed and I called and the owner answered he directed me to another Resturant where he was sure that everything halal is served and informed me that is where he himself will eat if not at his place   I think that was very nice of him   JZK for being kind"}
{"text":"Excellent home made Pakistani food, every time I eat their food reminds me of Pakistan home, chicken tikka and the briyani is great!! The owner is very friendly and take care of his customers!!  keep it up!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Pakistani food then you've found it. The haleem, chicken karahi, and chicken biryani are our favorites. Extremely friendly and courteous owner, who provides excellent service. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"i tried their chicken Biryani. Chicken was not well marinated and i was not very happy with the biryani spices too. I bought the groupon but when i tried to use it, the owner's face went pale. I am not sure why the voucher was even floated if you are disappointed when the customer tried to use it."}
{"text":"First time here the food is amazing and people are very nice here. FYI nothing left in my Chicken Tikka Masala lol oh try the Naan bread too it is very good."}
{"text":"Good Desi food with good service. Also like the prices. Highly recommend if you are in the area"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The owners take ownership in running the business. The best dishes I tried are as follow Tandori chicken, Nehari, Haleem and chicken baryanni. Giving it 5 stars. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Great authentic Indo-Pak Food with home made spices  Better than any other indopak restaurant."}
{"text":"By far this is the worst place I've been service sucks ass it took almost an hour and 30 min for our dinner to come the chai was horrible yeah no good experience not coming back at all"}
{"text":"Best chicken/Goat Karahi in town...!!!  Went with friends on Friday lunch. We were 8 people. Service was prompt. You could tell from the food that everything was made fresh. I loved it so much, went with wife over the weekend. She loved it..This place is going to be our regular place from now on :)"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had!  I was excited to try this place because I recently moved to a house across the street.  I was sorely disappointed.  The place was being run by two teens.  Within minutes of ordering we spotted our first cockroach crawling.  We spotted several more during dinner and couldn't continue to eat.  The food tasted good for the most part but we a mild beef appetizer as something for our toddler to munch on.  They came out and said they didn't have anymore of that item and recommended the potato version instead.  When I told him it was for the toddler he said it would be fine.  What came out tasted good but was so spicy it would not be good for a toddler.  My chicken tikka masala said it was spicy on the menu but was not spicy at all.  The garlic naan did not have ANY garlic flavor whatsoever.  When I asked if there was a manager I could speak to they indicated that he was not there and that there was no one else present.  When we were pulling out of the parking space, we saw the two teens explaining everything to an older woman.  Clearly there was someone else present but they didn't want to talk to us.  With the spicy food, we had to ask several times to get our drink refilled.  Since there was no manager there was no adjustment on the bill.  The only thing I was told is \"sorry, the seasons are changing so the roaches are coming out.\"  Not a good answer.  Restaurants need to have proper vermin control.  This was just disgusting.  I do not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"The service was very prompt and friendly. The food was good but not amazing to us. We prefer a bit more spice than this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was in the Phoenix area again a little while ago and decided to go eat here as I had been craving their tarka  daal. I'm sad to report that I found the quality of the food that I got had dropped tremendously low. The daal served was more akin to a watered porridge lacking any consistency or meaningful flavor. I was barely able to discern the grains or hints of garlic. I  also got a beef dish that I can't recall the name of and it too lacked any discernable flavor. Perhaps the owner changed the cooks or decided to take the task on himself that day. Only a few repeat visits would able to sort that out. But to be honest, my heart is just not in to going here again.. Anybody who knows or has a  passion for food will understand the impact of that statement. Based on this, I am downgrading my review for this place. I do however hope that others have a more positive experience."}
{"text":"Chicken tikka masala and naan was very tasty!  Because this is a small, family owned business make sure you call before arriving to make sure they are open!  This was our third try and it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to us. I was a bit skeptic about it as I had never heard about it. But...this place is beyond amazing. Best samosas I've ever had in US. Absolutely loved the spices in Chicken Biryani. I wish we had packed more. I'll definitely go back for the Mutton Biryani one day. Owner is very friendly!  Tip : Please be patient once you order. They make everything from scratch, but it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I hope this place survives. Small and unassuming. Went there a while away. While owner is nice, foot isn't vey good and cramped space.  Hopefully they improve."}
{"text":"The quality was very bad, Briyani was spoiled and the chicken was also old."}
{"text":"I love this food it is really good test and always fresh. I like the kabab karai. Also the biriyani taste as good as Arabian kabsa. This food is very close to middle eastern food."}
{"text":"This restaurant really made me feel like I was at home. The biryani was excellent. It feels more original and home cooked than the other desi restaurants in the valley. The rolls and wraps are also excellent."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times. Food always taste good, I would suggest if you are going to the resturant, please order ahead. They make everything fresh. It takes almost 20 minutes for them to bring food to  you.  you cannot beat the fresh taste of their food, Do try their gulab jamun, its my faviorte in desert."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook! Best food ever. I loved the Chicken Biryani, it could not have been more flavorful, and the mix of spices with the chicken was unbelievable. The white sauce you pour over everything was taking my food to a whole other level. I had watched a recent episode on the food network about Pakistani food. I went online and found Lahori's Daba. Since I am about as all American as it gets, the reviews sent me here. I was not sorry. I had wonderful service from the owner and his son. Polite, courteous and quick. I brought my small son, and we enjoyed the cultural aspects of all of the families coming in with their kids. It was like visiting a foreign country. We had the almond rice pudding for desert. Perfect sweetness and consistency. Delicious taste. We asked for Samosa's but the owner explained he had not gotten any today. I will definitely be back. Loved the atmosphere. Loved the prices. Loved the portions. Cannot say anything negative. My new fave food place......I felt like we had transported to another country and were in the heart of Pakistan. It was awesome ! Definitely going to go back for more."}
{"text":"The best briyani in town. The hosts are great and service is excellent. Karahi chicken is lip smacking. Must go for Indian food lovers."}
{"text":"I know Pakistani cuisine as Im Pakistani. Ive been to this restaurant once and tried their paratha rolls (both chk and beef) and chicken karahi. I had them made spicy. The rolls were tasty, authentic and delicious. The chicken karahi was good. The food made me long to come back and try something else. Im definitely going back for the rolls.   The place is not fancy but is clean. It seems to be family owned. I wish them luck as we really need a tasty Pakistani restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The space is small but the food is excellent. The naan is perfect. Spice scale is 1-10, I would recommend a 7 to not make the food too hot."}
{"text":"Great good. We were craving desi food,  been out of San Francisco for a week . Yelped this mace when we reached Scottsdale. Great authentic food! Great customer service. Must try Chappli kabab"}
{"text":"We wanted to go to the Thai place next door, but it was closed, so we tried this place instead, and it was awesome! We ordered samosas for an appetizer, but they were out. However, the food was quickly brought out so it didn't matter. We ordered a chicken kabob and chicken tikka masala. Both DELICIOUS. This little place has big flavor. They also threw in a free dessert. So nice, so good."}
{"text":"Finally got a place for an authentic Indian/Pakistani cuisine. If you're in Phoenix and looking for great food, this is the place.  Their biryanis and fried rice is not what we usually have in AZ. It's outstanding.  Ordered chicken pakora and Chana chaat as starters, to go with mango lassi. All three were incredibly amazing. Then for the main course we had mutton biryani, chicken fried rice, chicken boti and chapli kebab for the BBQ, beef Balti and chicken tikka masala. All on recommendation from the owner.  Quantity and quality of food was impressive. They were spiced according to the order. Perfect. Pocket friendly menu. Not a lavish decor or great ambiance, but a nice small n cozy place. Food is their main concern. Owners are very friendly and amazing people. Will be back for sure to try other items on the menu. Can't wait. View More Reviews"}
{"text":"Awesome little Pakastani place! I got the boneless chicken handi on a spice level 7 with rice and it was sooo good. The owner was really gracious and recommended it to me. I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place today for a late lunch. It wasn't very busy, so there was no wait and the food came out pretty quickly. It's a bit of a dive, which doesn't usually put me off, but the lack of A/C was a bit more problematic for me. I mean, it's Arizona. You need a decent A/C system. They do have a fan, which is okay, but I imagine in summer it would be torture.   On to the food: I don't know if it's because it's more Pakistani than Indian food, but it just wasn't quite what I expected (in fairness to them, their menu does say it won't be like what you've experienced before). But that aside, the flavor should still be there, and it wasn't for me. The garlic naan didn't have any garlic flavor and wasn't the traditional naan I'm used to. For a flat bread, it was okay, just kind of bland. The rice, I will say, was very good. The chicken tandoori was also good, but the chicken tikka masala was only so-so. It just lacked flavor.   It seems the restaurant recently changed ownership and they are apparently trying to drum up more business with customers who come in. And while they were very friendly and nice, and the service was good, I found the sales pitch a little long and intrusive. On the whole, it was an all right place, but not amazing enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"I went in here after they renovated from being Shalimar. New owners now which is a bummer but I'm not surprised. The old owner was a great cook and very friendly, but he needed help in the kitchen and I think was a little overwhelmed doing so much himself. The new food is still great, but not quite as amazing. I did appreciate the renovation though, it looked much nicer. Food isn't as dirt cheap as it was, but still very reasonable. I'll be coming back next time I'm in Chandler."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The food is definitely one of the best middle Eastern foods around the valley. The owner is extremely friendly and helped us with out selections of food. The tikka chicken masala is an excellent choice. Highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Not a lot of flash, but a TON of flavor!  In other words, it's exactly what you want from a little family-run ethnic restaurant.  My wife and I have eaten here three times and it has been excellent all three times.  Twice, we have eaten in and once we have taken the food to go.  I have had the tarka daal, the chicken biryani and the beef balti.  All three were full of flavor and prepared beautifully.  We particularly like the tarka daal (which is a vegetarian lentl dish, not sure if it is vegan).  I really like the rice they use in their dishes, probably too much as I usually stuff myself.  The portions are generous.  Honestly, you can pretty much guarantee that you will have enough for dinner plus lunch the next day.  Given that, the prices are more than fair.  The service is as you'd expect in a small place: friendly, professional but not over-the-top. You can tell there is a lot of pride from the family in what they do.    I'm no expert on Pakistani cuisine, but this place is totally yummy.  If you like Indian food, this is very similar.  You will even find some of the classic dishes like biryani and tikka masala.  I'm so excited we have this place in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place has amazing, delicious, and fresh Indian food. We got samosas to start, I ordered the Chana masala, and my husband ordered chicken tikka masala. Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"I am a foodie, and since I come from Goa, I can confidently say that I know Indian food well. Really well .. Lol In the whole of Phx no place can offer a chicken biryani to Rival this place.. It's very reasonably priced and quantities are gracious..check it out!"}
{"text":"Looking at all the reviews, we decided to give this restaurant a try on Saturday for lunch. When we entered there were hardly anyone may be coz we were a little early.. My husband had been before and said they make it fresh so waiting period is a little more than usual  We ordered tandoori chicken, mango lassi, chicken biryani, boneless chicken handi with naan. We wanted to eat Karahi but their chef was not there.. Put me in question who was cooking??  As soon as the food arrived which was after half an hour. presentation was really impressive my stars go for that and freshly made mango lassi and naan which were good.. The chicken handi had no taste was so bland and felt the chicken was spoilt and same with the biryani, I being a regular cook I felt the biryani was made and refrigerated and warmed up for us.. The biryani had no flavor, The rice was hard and chicken stinked.. My husband who is a regular felt bad coz he wanted me to try and this was it  Such a disappointment I'm never going to visit this place again"}
{"text":"It's great. Under new management, it is vastly improved. The chicken Tikka masala and Mateer paneer are outstanding if a tad oily. The samosa were perfect - potato/veg blend with perfect amount of crispness. The main problem is that you can't tell wear the restaurant is because there's no sign unless I still couldn't see it. I had to call the guy and ask him to direct me toward it. I truly hope this doesn't prevent people from going in, because the food is outstanding and not expensive at all.The restaurant is very cute to sit in or order and head in to pick it up, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am a foodie and have been a connoisseur with various dishes, this restaurant is by far the best I have tasted in authentic kebabs, biryanis and meat based dishes. It's simply awesome. Try any meat based dishes only, you will really fall in love with the taste. It caters to Indian/Pakistani taste buds. The dine-in facility is small but neat, forget the sprawl and focus on the food... I would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Not worth....any other Indian restaurant is far better than this....time waste money waste....disappointed.....less quantity no quality....for a $10 price 2pieces of tandoori not worth....worst experience"}
{"text":"Money minded, the quantity is very less for the price. If you are lucky then the food might be good. My request is to avoid this restauaent."}
{"text":"4.5 out of 5 stars. Food was very good (regular naan, Lahori's Dahi Balah, Tarka Daal), and of decent portion size, prices are very reasonable. Service was very friendly, although it did seem a little slow even when there were not many customers. They were \"in the back,\" so I cannot be sure if they were attending to other restaurant business, but it did appear that way. I'll be happy to return."}
{"text":"I just can't say enough about how delicious their food is!  Soooo good and freshly made for you!  My husband is Pakistani and even he loves the authentic food. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it!  The biriyani is to die for!  So good!  You definitely won't go wrong ordering food from here.  So check it out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Travelled throughout US but this is the Best Indian/ Pakistani food i ever had in US hands down!! Can't wait to come back again. Amazing service and ambience!"}
{"text":"First time in Chandler area. Originally from Pakistan so I know the difference between the so called authentic and want to be. The food is excellent. The owner is a very nice guy and will get you the food the way you like it. I plan on traveling to the area often and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken and lamb biriyani as well as the chicken kahari. Food was cooked fresh and tasted decent. Was a little oily. But was different than most other South east Asian restaurants. Small restaurant so its very casual."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner for the first time today. Great food, the chicken I had was so tender it just about melted in my mouth. And the array of spices was not overpowering but a perfect complement for the dish. Highly recommend, and it was worth the 20 min drive!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's rude but I have to lick my fingers!!! We just lunched here & the Chicken Karahi is AMAZING! The meat that came with the nehari was melting. So tender. I love the service~ they really care about the customer & the quality of the good matches. Thank you! You keep us coming back."}
{"text":"We are visiting from a small town in California where Indian food is not available. The food at this place was fantastic and was exactly what we were looking for. The service is slow only because they make everything fresh, so the waiting is no big deal.   The shopping center where it is located is little sketchy but I had my hubby with me and it was still light outside. I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went there at around 7.30. They were out off most of the things on the menu. We eventually ordered a kabab plate, butter chicken and a mutton dish with naans. The owner came to us after 25 mins and asked us if we can to-go our order since they wanted to close their restaurant early at 8 that day. If that was the case he should have just told us when we came in and we would have just left and not wasted our time. Anyways we told him that we are visitors to the area and cannot to-go it. And since the order was already ready he asked us if we can eat quickly and also told us that they were out of the kabab that we ordered. So we were already pissed at that point. The butter chicken and mutton came. The butter chicken was watery. The first time i saw a butter chicken like that. But anyways i had a taste of it. The chicken was smelly ( which means the chicken was spoilt and they cooked the spoilt chicken). YUK! We called the manager and told him about it. And told him to taste it. He tasted it and said it was ok..I told him to smell the damn chicken. And he was like- Its good. Yea right dude!. We were so pissed that we packed the naan and mutton ( which was ok ok )and left the chicken behind. Did not pay for the yukky butter chicken and left. We headed to Ruchi Vegetarian hotel and really enjoyed the food there. Will write a review on that place later."}
{"text":"A big five star for the food. Don't go for a fancy ambience, and keep in mind it takes time to prepare good food. I have already been there 2 times in last 3 days.  1st day - Goat Biryani 2nd day - chicken biryani, Lahori Karahi Chicken  I must say, you can feel the freshness of the food as it's made from scratch. Each and every dish is very flavorful. Chicken in biryani is perfectly boiled. The taste of food is unbeatable.  Never expected I will eat such authentic food here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Writing this review as I dine here . We were a group of 7 on a Thursday afternoon . We were the only people in the restaurant . Mediocre food but ridiculously long wait time . Reached around 11:45 am got my food at 12:45 . I guess there was only the owner who had to take orders, make and serve food . There was this other group who got in but had to get to go boxes since the food did not arrive on Time . And the temperature inside was super Warm . Arizona summer and no air conditioning - duh ??"}
{"text":"Tried their mutton karahi, prepared from their house special recipe. WOW. Nihari is The Best in AZ, which is complimented with Naans. You won't find this combination any better than this place. If you are a nihari fan, this is your place to come. Their chicken tikka masala with house special rice is unique in taste n aroma. It's a must to try. Most of their items go so quickly right after they are made, the secret being, everything is so freshly made. You have to make sure about the availability of their signature dishes before you check in. People know that they make fresh food, so they book in their orders prior to their arrival. You can tell about the quality of food just in a glance."}
{"text":"Outstanding food!! Best Pakistani food in the valley. No doubt. Family run place with great service.  Recommend highly!!!"}
{"text":"Murgh Chana was amazing. Mutton karahi was ok. Dishes are little expensive but quality of food is good"}
{"text":"The food was very authentic and fresh! I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and I was very pleased. They asked how spicy I would like it, and they made it perfect! My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Biriani , it was very spicy and full of flavor. More Chicken in the Biriani would have been nice next time. The servers are very friendly, I am looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"The BEST food and service! I have tried the chicken tikka, Baluch balti, samosas, and Nihari; all are so delicious! Unbelievable!   Today, I wanted delivery but door dash stops at 8pm so I called the restaurant and the owner was such a gentleman that he promised to deliver the food himself!!! That's unheard of in most places and I  greatly appreciated it.    The BEST family owned place and a MUST visit.  Post mates charged me $14.25 for delivery charge so forget it and never use it; door dash is the way to go.  Great food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken kArhae  ... and it's great Pakistani taste .. the naans are awesome as well ... I will definitely go there next time to explore some food items"}
{"text":"I got a take out of chicken biriyani and tandoori chicken appetizer. The appetizer was good , but the biriyani was too oily and the chicken tasted as if it was old. Tried it first time, but not going back again"}
{"text":"I had food here today with my friend and what a food it was!!!we ordered Chapli kabab, poori,mutton biriyani and chicken karahi with a mango lassi   Quantity - 4 good Taste- 5 it was excellent.. couldn't find a flaw..tasted authentic Price- 4 very reasonable   Tried chapli kabab and chicken karahi for the first time and they tasted delicious.. biriyani met the expectations.. food might take some time to be served but as they rightly advertise.. authentic sub continent food takes time as it is not a fast food.. trust me , it's worth the wait.."}
{"text":"I have been here many many times for dinner over the past year.   Every time it's been enjoyable.   I want this restaurant to succeed!!!   The owner is a quiet man who aims to please.   His wife is the cook and I've never laid eyes on her but her way of blending spices into her meals is spot on Hell's kitchen style.   She does it right!   The son is the waiter.   Once you get over his shy attitude and the sense he doesn't want to be there,  service will immediately improve.   Don't take it personally.   He's consistent in his mannerisms.   I find the food to be delicious and the atmosphere warm & personable and service and meals are deliciously consistent.   I drive out of my way to have dinner here and think it's rewarding to share a meal here with friends and family.   The vegetarian lentil dish and the nahari dish are my two favorites.  Enjoy the experience for what it is!   You'll most likely walk away with some delicious leftovers too!"}
{"text":"Went on 08/28/2015 for the second time to Lahori's Dhaba.  I actually ordered carryout.  My wife and I ordered Beef Nihari, and the famous Chicken Biriyani.   1) Regarding the Chicken Biriyani, there is only one word that describes the following, \"Wow!!!\"  I mean it in a good way.  I was pleasantly surprised.  About the only other place that I remember where the biriyani tasted like this was a Muslim restaurant I ate at in Delhi.  It was good.  This was worth the wait.  I even ordered it ahead of time.  Chicken Biriyani is good.  They suggested Mutton Biriyani, but I think that if I ordered mutton instead of chicken, it would have been too heavy for my wife or I.  The biriyani is good.  It is worth it.  Keep the quality.  No change needed.  2) For the Beef Nihari, still very good.  Worth ordering.    Usually, whenever my wife and I go to a place like this, we tend to order one entree each, and we make sure to order two dishes that are dramatically different from each other, as we like to share.  This is why we ordered one beef and one chicken.    This further emphasizes that the quality of the food is very good at Lahori's Dhaba.  They just need to work on a few things regarding presentation and service.  I am sure that if they get that straightened out, and they perhaps do some unique things for market distinction, they will have a good, stable, steady business.  What scares me about this business though is that this place is always so quiet...even on a Friday night at 6:30 PM.  I do not see many customers.  Everyone knows that a business needs paying customers to survive.  Restaurants are a tough business.  I really want this business to make money and to survive.  If they can figure out the marketing and work at differentiating themselves from their competition, they hopefully can accomplish this.    This place needs to be as busy as some of the Middle Eastern (Lebanese) restaurants that my wife and I go to in the Valley (where there is an hour wait for a table because of demand).  I want to see this place that busy.    I definitely wish this restaurant well."}
{"text":"Great place to dine. The shop closes at 2:30 p.m. and I showed up at 2:30 p.m. not only did he leave his doors open for me he asked if I wanted to dine in. My food was made to order and it was delicious I had the lentil soup. I will definitely come back great customer service"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  Between 4 of us, we split 3 dishes:  Paneer Cholay, Tarka Daal, and Boneless Chicken Handi.  All 3 were incredibly delightful to our taste buds.  We asked for the Tarka Daal to have a little more heat, and boy did they deliver!  The lentils in the Takara Daal were cooked to perfection.  The sauce with the lentils over the rice...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  For the Tarka Daal, the meat just fell off the bones and it was SO incredibly flavorful!  The description of this dish is right, \"flavors you have never experienced before\".  The Paneer was cooked wonderfully and the extra textures and flavors in that dish were spectacular.  It is a shame we live in another state as I would love to visit this restaurant at least once a week.  Eat here!  You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If I can give zero or negative rating to this restaurant that would still be not enough to describe how bad the food is at this restaurant. I ordered chicken biryani, for the sake of full disclosure I am from Pakistan and know how a freshly made biryani should look and taste like. The biryani that was served to me was not biryani by any standard. The rice and meat looked and tasted really old I say at least 2-4 days old and been in and out of a refrigerator, the yogurt raitha that was served with the biryani was actually sour in taste as if it was prepared few days ago. My 2nd dish was murgh cholay and I tell you the the chicken tasted awful and again old. The cholay (chick peas) were not cooked all the way through and still had a crunch to them which is a huge no for this particular dish.   Overall my experience here was awful and even if they pay me to come back and eat here I will respectfully decline that request."}
{"text":"Has their Nihari, chicken biryani, aloo tikki and chana chaat. Really authentic Pakistani/Indian taste. The staff was really courteous. I would highly recommend them and will definitely visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Not to clean.  Everything tasted like fish, a bit odd."}
{"text":"This really isn't an update I am just trying to add my pics! As I type this I will try not to eat it all before the pic. This food is amazing! have I already said that lol. I am trying the famous chicken biryani...oh my best I have ever Had! I know my biryani too! The sauce is beautiful, that comes on the side. I also had the best mango Lassi of my life today at Lahori's. As I work my way through the entire menu I'll update here. I have a feeling the 5 stars will remain the same from me! Oh the Tandoori chicken, Lahori's Nihari, and even the Hot tea are all divine!"}
{"text":"Delicious food !! Love the characters chicken biriyani the owner is super friendly and accommodating . Great service"}
