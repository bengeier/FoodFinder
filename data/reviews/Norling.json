{"text":"My friends and I stumbled across this majestic hidden gem one tired evening after an escapade at Caribana. We were hesitant upon entering the quiet restaurant but a customer entering told us that it was a good place so we decided to take a risk. To our great surprise, that risk resulted in a fantastic return. The food and hospitality exceeded all of our expectations. The owners were extremely patient and took the time to answer all of our questions about Tibetan food and offer his recommendations. We will definitely be back! 10/10."}
{"text":"Wow. My husband and I went here on a whim because we needed somewhere close to take some visiting family members before they left town. Singularly the best whim I've ever had.  We'd tried momos before but that was the extent of our familiarity with Tibetan food so ordering was an adventure. We started with Gyuma, which was a moderately spicy, intensely seasoned Tibetan sausage dish. We were picking stray bits of onions off the dish when the actual sausage had all been eaten just to get more of that ridiculously delicious sauce. At $6.49 it was very reasonably priced and made a nice teaser for the four of us.   We then ordered four dishes to share (Please do this! You're cheating yourself if you only try one dish!). We ordered beef momos ($7.99) because we knew we'd like those. The seasoning was much more complex than others we'd tried. They were moist without being excessively greasy and generally a pleasure to eat. That said, they were the least memorable bit of the meal.  The Phing-sha (8.99) -- oh what fun we had trying to pronounce these dishes, fortunately our server was a great sport -- managed to feel familiar and brand new all at once. A beef stew with large chunks of potatoes, on the surface it's not far from the meat and potatoes I grew up on, but the black fungus, glass noodles and intense sesame flavour was a far cry from anything I had as a child in Atlantic Canada. Who knew a brand new dish could be a comfort food? This is not spicy, just richly flavorful. If you're fond of Chinese dishes that are heavy on the sesame you'll probably enjoy this as well. We all loved it.  The Chilly Beef (I can't find this on the takeout menu I snagged, but it was in the Tibetan section under mains if you want to try it) was an adventure. Tender pieces of beef in a rich and moderately spicy sauce -- I'm tempted to call it a gravy -- that was loaded with hot, hot, hot green chillis. Our server warned us that the chillis were hot and he was right to do so. It's a great dish because they're easily avoided for the less heat inclined members of your party, but if you like it spicy they're there for the taking. Again, at 8.99 this was a steal and worth every penny.  Finally, my favorite dish. Tsey Khatsa (8.99). Honestly, we had no idea what we were ordering. Described as 'Spicy fried vegetables in chef's special sauce' this was mainly us trying to be adults and eat our vegetables. I've never been so pleased to be responsible. This can best be described as vegetable fritters in a thick, lightly spicy sauce. I've never had a vegetable dish that was so incredibly rich and flavorful, every bite was a treat. I'm already looking for an excuse to go back and eat this again and again.   We stuck to the Tibetan portion of the menu, but if I have my way I'll worth through every dish there. The food was impeccable from start to finish, and fussy, fussy girl that I am, I don't say that very often. The only part of the evening that wasn't perfect was a very long wait for our food, but we received an unprompted explanation, an apology, and a discount. I have no reason to think a long wait is typical or that it will happen again, and honestly, the food was so good it wouldn't stop me from returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food and super friendly staff. Since I am not familiar with this type of food, the server took her time to explain to me some of the items on the menu.  I ordered the chicken manchurian combo. It came with momo(Loooved it!!), steamed bun, rice, salad and soup(I chose seeet corn -- it was ok). The chicken was flavourful, very spicy(I wanted really spicy).  Definitely coming back for more momo!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner with a group of friends this past weekend. It was really effortless to book my group in (6 of us), and to confirm/change the reservation by text message.   This was my first time (and actually every single person in my group's first time) trying Tibetan/Nepalese cuisine. We were largely impressed!   The man who took our orders (he might have been the owner?) was very patient in describing to us what dishes had in them, and what he recommended. We liked just about everything we ordered. These were the apps we all shared:    1) Vegetable pakoras: soo good! Perfectly fried and not oily at all -- a bright shade of red but not spicy, seasoned well.    2) Tripe: this had a curry flavour to it, and a good amount of spice. As a big fan of tripe in dim sum, I liked this a lot.      3) Blood sausage: very unique! It had a deep reddish-brownish colour and lots of spices and heat. We didn't quite know what to expect but everyone really liked it.    4) Beef momos: so much like Chinese dumplings! They even came in a dim sum steamer basket. It came with a plate of coleslaw-like cabbage and two sauces (one kind of like sriracha) for dipping. Really good filling-to-wrapper ratio :)   5) Cauliflower: lightly fried and spicy, this was one of my favourite appetizers and something we wouldn't have ordered if it hadn't been suggested to us. Restaurants need to make more cauliflower dishes!!   And then people ordered individual mains, which ranged from hakka food (e.g. chow mein) to chili chicken + rice, which reminded me of Chinese sweet and sour pork.   We were all pretty happy with our choices and liked trying something so different. The service was really great, too, and they split the bill for us at the end with no problems."}
{"text":"A Tibetan take on Hakka cuisine.  Both the Tibetan and Hakka food are great.  Highlights include the Manchurian anything, the cauliflower, and best Tingmo in Parkdale.  Great lunch specials."}
{"text":"We've been twice now to Norling, and both experiences were great!  The place is very clean, the atmosphere is pleasant.  The service is friendly and attentive, and the food is excellent.  I particularly ejoyed the Gyuma and the Beef Tripe.  Momos are also delicious.  Their lunch special combos are an excellent and economical option, as well.  Really, no complaints here.  Highly recommended!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My new local take out spot with many amazing dishes. My fav is the Norling fried pork."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and boy, do I love it. The cauliflower - stop it. The sausage appetizer - shut up. Two of my favourites.  Not only is the food amazing, the service is excellent! They are always happy to make recommendations, they are attentive, and very friendly. All this and at a minimal cost. The last time I went, a dinner for 4 (with drinks) was $75 - 3 apps, 3 main courses (with rice) and 4 drinks. There's nothing negative to say - I love this place."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We will come back for sure. Prices were quite affordable. I am sure it will become a favorite of our family."}
{"text":"Was brought here by friends and am so glad!!! The food is delicious. We had all vegetarian meals but ask the server for suggestions. Will definitely return to try more."}
{"text":"Best Hakka food downtown -- to get as good as this you're driving out to Kim Kim. Highly recommend: great food, charming service, and amazing value."}
{"text":"Great service! Nice environment and really love the chicken mono!!! The price is also decent, all main course less than 10 dollars. Haven't try lunch special but looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"We were walking along the very Western edge of Queen W, looking for a place to eat a late lunch, when it dawned on us that we were in the middle of a Tibetan area.  Hurrah for Tibetan food!  We decided to stop in to Norling, just because it looked good.  And were we ever glad we did!  The staff working were very friendly, and answered our questions about the menu.  We ordered a noodle dish and a beef dish that came with rice, that was a perfect amount of food for two people with good appetites.  The portions were generous and tasty, and I would love to come back with a bunch of friends to be able to share lots of dishes.  The prices were more than fair.  Bonus points: the bathrooms are pretty nice.  Which is a good thing when you've been walking around all afternoon."}
{"text":"I never tried Hakka before, this was an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place and their lunch options are very affordable but their condiments show no attention to cleaning my soya sauce is usually clogged  That out of the way, please come 11am to 3pm for a Tibetan cheap eat treat like Thali or other dishes with salad and Tingmo (steamed twisted bread) they are very nice and attentive I sometimes run out of water"}
{"text":"The spicy beef dry was amazing so we had to order another round of it! Great service and reasonably priced. Recommended if your in Parkdale."}
{"text":"I had chilli chicken and norling fried noodles both were bland and didn't taste good the service was good but the food was really bland. The chicken pakora literally tasted like a chicken cracker and super dry. I would not be visiting this restaurant ever again"}
{"text":"I quite like this place and the lunch speacial is the best deal in town!  My first foray into Hakka was at Lee Gardens on Sheppard and after having been there recently (and they are known as one of the best) both my wife and I like this more.  Killer chili chicken and excellent thali plates.  And the nicest people ever.  One of my favorite spots in the hood!"}
{"text":"Norling is by far the best place for authentic tibetan and hakkar cuisine. A great variety of food for both vegetarians and non veg, which is fresh and savoury. They have quick and friendly service. The atmosphere is warm and i ate my food with no disturbances. Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knees! I've been craving momos forever and finally got my fix. Came on a Thursday evening and there was only two other parties inside. We were able to get street parking right in front, which made it easy for me with my crutches. The decor is very minimalistic, and not much to brag home about, but that's not why I go. We pretty much already knew what we wanted, and ordered right away. The only thing I would say I'm not a fan of, is that they bring everything out at once. We ordered the chicken corn soup, chicken steamed momos, pan fried beef momos, chili garlic noodles, chili chicken, and tea. The steamed momos were delicious, and were complimented well by the sauces they provide. Momos I find to be more stickier than Chinese dumplings. The soup hit the spot for such a cold night, and with some hot sauce inside, it was a party for my tastebuds. The chili chicken threw me off at first because it was in a gravy, but it was still delicious and went well with the noodles. I don't find them to be spicy at all, but more so flavorful. For everything it came up to just under 50 bucks, plus tip. It was a lot of food for the two of us, but great leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on a random Thursday night as I'd seen tons of rave reviews for this place on Yelp.  It looks very plain and boring inside.  Maybe even borderline dingy.  There's alot of dust and cobwebs in the corners if you pay attention to that kind of thing.  I ordered the chili chicken as that's what everyone says to try.  Don't get me wrong, it was good.  It just didn't seem all that special to me.  It was chicken -sauce - rice - cut up chilli.  That's it.  I enjoyed it, and the portion size was very fair for the price.  I just wasn't filled with that \"wow! I have to try this again soon!\" feeling.  The service was just ok.  The waitress seemed to have a bit of a language problem and didn't seem to know a whole lot about the ingredients in the different dishes on the menu.  And for the love of all that is holy, someone needs to shut off that thing in the back that beeps every 7 seconds! PLEASE!!!! It was driving myself and my date absolutely insane."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now, and had a great experience both times. While I've had Tibetian food before, this is the first place I've eaten that also has Hakka cuisine.  The staff are very friendly, the service is fast and they are happy to answer any questions a person unfamiliar with the region's food may have about the menu.  The first time I was here, my partner and I shared two appetizers: steamed beef momos (dumplings) and the shabaley (fried beef patties in pastry). These are not your typical small, single-person-sized starters - the portions are large and suitable for sharing. Watch out for the hot sauce that comes on the side of the shabaley: it is very spicy!   The second time I was here, I chose one of the lunch specials which consisted of soup, an amdo momo, rice, a small coleslaw-like side salad, a bowl of phingstey (beef stew) and a huge tingmo (steamed bun) all for only $7.49. It was actually more food than I could finish just for lunch.   Apparently this restaurant also makes their own hand-pulled noodles, Manchurian specialties, Tibetian sausages and hearty curries, so I will definately be back to try some more of the dishes.  Update: I've been back and those hand-pulled noodles are great! My husband got a curried lamb stew and it was also very good.  Update 2: Added a fifth star. Been back several more times and also ordered delivery. This place is consistently great, the service and food are always spot-on. Get the cauliflower salt-and-pepper appetizer: seriously. I wouldn't normally request a plate of cauliflower in a restaurant but this stuff is amazing.   I also love the Hakka Noodles (Spicy but great!) but my go-to is still amdo momos. Yum."}
{"text":"Courteous staff. I tried the vegetarian momo and it was delicious. I love how minced the filling was. I also tried the tibetan noodle soup and that was memorializing. The Tibetan-pulled wide noodles tasted like momo skin dough cooked in broth (so tasted like pasta). But the noodle soup was delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is delicious and the prices are super reasonable. Staff is very friendly. Fair warning the portions are huge. Two apps and two mains is more then enough for two people. Also the lunch specials are great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing value! Don't let the low price throw you off, the food here is excellent. The best lunch combo I've had in the Parkdale area so far.  I came here with a group of friends on a recommendation and I'll be back. I had a vegetable lunch combo. It came with a soup (I chose sweet and sour), 1 vegetable momo (Fried dumpling), these fried vegetable balls in a sauce, a side of rice, and a small salad. You can also choose if you want to have steamed buns instead of rice.  The service is fast, and the place is really clean and cute!  Totally recommend this for families and friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely yummy food and their pakoras rock! Was a truly delicious experience and look forward to a future visit :)."}
{"text":"ln norling you really feel like in Tibet attended always with a smile, we started with a delicious veggie momos and main course were the best chiken curry we was tried in toronto soft, tasty with spicy enough .Very good service and price, totaly recomended"}
{"text":"So we have been going to this restaurant for awhile and was really excited to eat their food. We had planned to go there on a saturday and since we knew it might get busy, so we called in for a reservation. On the day, my friends came in 10 minutes earlier, but they gave away our table to a larger party. When it hit 8pm, there was no for us to sit at . So my point is what is the point of making reservation if you are not saving space for us. She could have just said we only do walk ins and not taken our reservation."}
{"text":"I'm at a loss as to how this place has 5 stars. I feel bad writing this as I want to support small businesses in the area, but I feel extremely ripped off by this restaurant. We ordered stir fried vegetables, chicken moms and chili fried rice. I know, not the best dishes to get a full range of flavors from a restaurant, but these are hard dishes to mess up. The chili friend rice, had no spice and to be frank no flavor. Besides a few peas, a speck of egg and carrots there was nothing else in here. We actually had to cook up an onion and doctor it ourselves to make it have any bit of flavor. The vegetable dish was an embarrassing portion. This would be fine if these dishes were cheap, but they were both $10 plus. I'll never order from here again."}
{"text":"Seriously the best gyuma(blood sausages), flavorful and tasty! They also have the lunch thali specials which my girlfriend and I always for brunch. The owner is super nice and making sure we are satisfied and checking in on us."}
{"text":"If i'm in this neighbourhood, this is where I go for lunch.  they have the best lunch specials!... soup (hot & sour or corn your choice), plus spring roll or deep fried beef momo (your choice), your meal (6 or 7 things to choose from) which include tingmo (steamed bun) plus rice.  It's filling and will satisfy anyone with an appetite.   I've been at dinner but the lunch deals are so good.  I usually only do lunch and it's where the 5 stars come in.  Value at dinner is a lot less even though the food is still very good."}
{"text":"I dream about the cauliflower salt and pepper. Wonderful service, delicious food."}
{"text":"Came here twice and gotta say the food was amazing both times.  The tripe and the blood sausages are the best I have ever had.  I gotta admit I'm not familiar with Tibetan food but the owner makes good recommendation and is super nice! I hope they do well. Definitely good value too."}
{"text":"Trying out a new cuisine can be really tricky. The knowlege, level of service, and hospitality of the restaurant staff greatly influence the experience of the diner(s).   No warm welcome not a smile nor a \"hello\", just \"table for two?\" Told the waitress this was our first time and asked for recommendations. Answers were short and dismissive.   Ordered: - Beef Chilli (beef soft with a decent sauce and medium spice) which comes with rice and the following:         - (Deep) Fried beef momo (dumpling) -                    outside nice and crisp but inside of                    dough was soggy and the ground beef             tasted off         - Tingmo - tastes like a delicious Chinese            bao with soft layers that pull apart easily            and is perfect to dip in any available            sauce.         - Coleslaw - good crunch but bland         - Hot and sour soup -thin, flavorful and             spicy - Chicken Thenthuk soup with hand pulled flat noodles. Chicken soup with soft noodle squares was bland even after adding salt, pepper and chili oil. - Cauliflower Salt and Pepper - they're dusted and deep fried. Great flavor, cauliflower is soft but edges are crispy. Gotta thank all the Yelpers for recommending this one.  Once food was dropped off, they didn't come by to check on us. Had to flag them down for the check and then later for to-go containers. Lunch prices are very affordable but entrees are heavy on the carby side.   Went to Himalayan Kitchen few doors down for some steamed beef momos and Tibetan tea, prices are similar but the difference in service is vast; Himalayan Kitchen staff are warm, friendly, accommodating and have no problem answering any and all questions.   Not sure I'll be back, think I'll try out the many other Himalayan restaurants in the area first."}
{"text":"There are very few foods I would qualify as crack - but one particular dish at Norling belongs in my personal crack category.   We arrived on a Friday evening around 6:30 PM, and the place was filling up. Starving, we ordered right away: a) the beef momos pan fried, b) the beef chilly, c) the tsey khatsa, and d) one butter tea, to try.  The beef momos were quite delicious, moist, yet crispy. The beef chilly was decent, with a nice kick to it. The butter tea was a little too oily for my liking - literally, it was like drinking a cup of melted butter. But... the highlight of the meal, the dish that made me sit up and think - whoa, ding ding ding!, yes, I'm coming back here. Imagine deep fried, crispy vegetable pakoras perfectly cooked and drenched in the most delicious sweet and spicy sauce - my friends, I present the Tsey Khatsa. A vegetarian dish worth swooning over; you're doing yourself a disservice by not ordering it when visiting this restaurant. This stuff is magical - a must-try.  Overall, we really enjoyed our time here. It looked like they were very short-staffed (one server, and a couple of cooks), so it took almost 40 minutes to even get our bill. But nonetheless, very patient and friendly staff, and an overall delicious meal. We will definitely be back.  For two people, with tax, and tip, we paid around $37.00, approximately. Note that street parking in front of the restaurant was around $2.00 an hour."}
{"text":"We actually came here after waiting 25 minutes at Tibet Kitchen down the street where we didn't even get asked our food order - 25 min wait!  Crazy.  So this experience was so lovely in comparison!!!  First off, we were greeted right away and seated instantly.   Menu's and waters came to our table maybe 30 seconds later.  The waitress came to take our order maybe another 1-2 minutes later.  She brought us a plate of complimentary shrimp chips which were quite yummy.  Our food came quick.  Momos, chili chicken and the Norling Special noodles.   Food was 3/5.  I'd recommend the chili chicken and momos.   Pricing was 4/5 - fair. Service was 5/5 - our waitress was great!   Atmosphere - 4/5 - nice, quiet, clean - simple.  and they had AC!  Thanks for making our night better!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time again at this restaurant. Owner was special nice greeting our group and recommended a variety of dishes. We enjoyed a variety of momos and beef patties that we tried previously. Then we started to be adventurous and ordered the Norling special noodles plus the mixed sizzling plate.  If you plan to come to the restaurant, make sure you make reservation via Yelp Seat Me. The owner reserved the usual tables for our party of 8. He was aware that some of us did not eat spicy and adjusted accordingly with recommendation. He also noted that some dishes were similar and pointed it out before we ordered.   Definitely will be back but recommend you go as a group of 4 or 8 so you can try everything with the perfect portions to share."}
{"text":"As a fan of Tibetan/Himalayan food, I really enjoyed my first visit to Norling a few months ago, so I took my friend there last night. I will admit that this second visit was not as good as the first, but I still enjoyed most of the food. The service was a little lacking, one water glass was not clean and it was sometimes hard to get the server's attention, but it had gotten very busy by then. The decor was very nice, a little fancier than other Tibetan places I have been to in Parkdale.  We had deep-fried beef momos, Phing-sha beef stew and chicken Thenthuk. The crispy momos were very good, especially with a little chili sauce. The stew was also very good; it had potatoes, vermicelli noodles and fungus (a black mushroom which my friend was very hesitant about, but at least tasted) with a bowl of rice on the side. The thenthuk was okay, it was basically a light chicken noodle broth, but nothing special. We finished with fried banana with ice cream, which was very sweet and tasty, and I had a cup of Tibetan butter tea as I always do. They also have a lot of Hakka dishes on the menu.  Overall the food was quite good, and only totalled about $35 for 2 people, and I was able to take home a little stew and a few momos. I would definitely recommend and return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to checking this place out for a while, as its always had such great reviews and I'm not one to shy away from Tibetan or Nepalese food. Unfortunately, the experience was not what I expected.  We gorged on a lot of food, which to its fair point was reasonably priced and nothing was bad (thus the 3 star review). But admittedly we were not overly enthused about much either.  The Details: We stuck to the white meat mains, which were the Chili Garlic Chicken which was admittedly bland and more garlic in flavour than anything else. Note for the future: order the dark meat chili chicken without the garlic.   The Chicken and Vegetables were somewhat boring but good for vegetable content which was otherwise missing from our plates. Vegetarian Hakka Noodle were super plain. For some reason I expected more vegetables to be included, so being such a plain bowl of noodles, I suggest paying the extra $1 for to include meat in it. The good news is that the simplicity in the Chicken & Vegetables mixed quite nicely with the Hakka Noodle to become the hit of the meal.  Also our chicken pakoras were super dry, and oddly came out last.   Beer selection is terrible, with only domestic options like bottles of Blue, Canadian, Keiths, and international beers Stella and Heineken. Their menu listed Kingfisher, but they didn't have any of it or any other more regionally appropriate options which was disappointing. Wine was cheap but apparently not very good.   And to top if off, make sure you aren't on a timeline when coming here. To the defense of the one waitress, she wasn't standing around wasting time... But having one server for an entire room on a weekend night speaks to the fact that the service won't be attentive, and it took a long time for our food to come out, so go in with tempered expectations on that front."}
{"text":"Very casual and homey Nepalese place on the quiet side of Queen st. W. I was intrigued by this place, expecting it to be a \"hidden gem.\"  Comfort food, very fresh + friendly service + reasonable price = might drop by again if I am in the area... but not worth to make a special trip   Tried: steamed beef and chicken momo, chili chicken, steamed rice  A bowl of steamed rice was a bit dry. Complementary pickled veggies was a nice touch as everything else was very heavy and dense. Overall, I was happy to try something new (never had Nepalese before) and it was nothing too unfamiliar to me. I don't see myself craving for it though.There was no life-changing moment during the meal.   Overall, if you are in the area and looking for a casual, cheap, comforting food, this place will do."}
{"text":"Excellent food experience.  Very delicious Himalayan/Tibetan food. The buns were huge and yummy, delicious chili fish, momos, soups and mango lassie .  Great prices.  Food is what makes the place otherwise not too clean, small, staff friendly enough."}
{"text":"Good deals on lunch specials. Unfortunately one of my least favourite chili chicken dinners.  Nice interior."}
{"text":"A small joint which serves tasty food at a reasonable price. I came here with a friend and we ordered the veg momos ,chilly fish and a vegetable gravy dish. The portions were generous and the service was delightful. The food tasted authentic  and did not have copious amounts of oil or spices to deal with. A real gem of a place!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great little find. Was staying nearby for a week and while exploring along Queen St stumbled into this little whole in the wall. Glad I did. Not a bunch of tables, but the place was about 80% full, that's always a good sign. It was about 2:30 so, opted for the lunch special. Ordered the Manchurian chicken which came with a bowl of the best sweet & sour soup that I have ever had in my life (and I mean that), a spring roll, rice, salad and tingmo. Tingmo is a Tibetan bread which is very unique, it's kinda layered and breaks apart nicely. The chicken had the right amount of spice, it wasn't overwhelming but, there were enough chilis in there to make it hot if you want. The spring roll was crisp and delicious. Ordered the chicken momo as well which came with a Chinese dumpling style sauce and a samba sauce. You could tell everything was fresh made that day. Staff was very friendly. Would eat here all the time if I could."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a food and not atmosphere kind of place. Came for the lunch special which is probably one of the cheapest things in the city that is still delicious!   Ordered the steamed momos (beef dumplings), the manchurian tofu lunch special and some kind of garlic chicken lunch. The steamed dumplings were good, they had a doughey-er wrapper filled with beef. They came with a side chili sauce that was SPICY (and my spice tolerance is quite high). The lunch specials came with a soup (I had chicken corn...DELICIOUS), a fried momo (basically a deep fried bun with beef inside (AMAZING, I'd eat these until I exploded), side of rice and side of salad, and the main dish (the manchurian tofu or the garlic chicken thing...THE TOFU is AMAZING...ORDER THIS MEAL, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT).  This has now become one of my go tos and I bring anyone who will come with me here! I will definitely be back to try it all!"}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced! Highly recommended for my first time, will definitely return. Ordered the Norling Special Fried Rice and Crispy Beef in Honey Sauce. Was spoiled with water and crispy snacks while I waited for my take out order."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place on my walk home one day.  It was so amazing!  They have great lunch specials for $7-$8.  They are such a good value!  I got a beef stew, steamed bun, white rice, coleslaw and momo.  It was delicious and filling!  I took half home, but I think it can be finished in one go. The service was great and it was comfortable with my baby and the stroller.  It's not a huge place, but it was fine if I moved the stroller out of the way. I cannot wait to go back next time!"}
{"text":"This may be the best Tibetan food in Parkdale! I discovered this place when another Tibetan restaurant in the area recommended that I go here to try the deep-fried momos. Yay, Tibetan camaraderie!   The deep fried momos were OK, but I think I liked the steamed ones better. The spicy cauliflower appetizer and spicy potato fries were AMAZING! The fries were like Tibetan poutine, in the best sauce you can imagine. The cauliflower was just lightly fried and the perfect texture, with fantastic spices. Oh my GOD, this food.   The Norling chicken, my main, was good but out-shined by the apps.   I will be back!  The total came to $60 for three apps, one shared main, and four glasses of wine, including tax and a decent tip. There were leftovers that I brought home to a fellow momo lover."}
{"text":"I really only ordered for take out(I was craving so hard) lol. My usual Momo place was closed at the hour I drove down so I decided to try this place.   The atmosphere inside was quite dark, but because I was there for take out I wasn't too bothered and I didn't examine further to see if they purposely didn't have lights in because it was day time outside or what.   The place is cute and small but still looks like they would be able to accommodate a small group of people.  Now the Momos, these dumplings were delicious. I took them for take out and drive home was about 30mins, so when I got home they were still nice and warm and still succulent and juicy. The portions were good and their hot sauce was tasty(just watery).   I would like to actually go back but sit in the restaurant and try other items, and once I do, I will update my review."}
{"text":"The service is really slow. They have to work alot fast in the kitchen. We were there for almost an hour for our food. Even other people were waiting for the food. There is only one waiting staff. She was eager to help but there was no urgency from the kitchen to offer quick service. But there is no doubt about the quality of food."}
{"text":"First off I loved trying Tibetan food. I lived in China for many years and on contrary to Chinese turkestan food that is extememly popular on east coast and major cities, Tibetan food is never common. I was ignorant about the fact that there is quite a few Tibetan restaurants in parkdale.   To me the Hukka part of the menu is great. Beautiful flavors. The momos, I have only tried the beef ones, however are tbh a little disappointing. But do note I was a well traveled foodie in China where dumplings and steam buns are so common and established part of food culture and as a result I have extremely high bars for them. Beef as stuffing itself is quite unusual (but not as unusual as chicken) because you always do better with lamb and pork as they have more fat. The beef dumplings is seasoned way too simplistically, not able to cover the unpleasant smell of the beef. And since the beef was quite lean, the results was very dry and bland meatballs inside the momo wrap. Maybe this is how momo is supposed to be, but in any case I have had much much better.  My story with there momo do not in any way take away the pleasure I had dining there. The waitress was lovely, the price was awesome (lunch special was 8 or 9 dollars a full tray of assorted items such as mutton, lentil soup, salad, rice and desert). And it was just cool!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is a pure gem and I speak highly of their Tibetan spread. I ordered Beef and Chicken Momo, Beef Chili (Shaptak), Syabhaley, Chowmein, and Pork Chili - and all of them were yummy. Beef Chili and Pork Chili were not exactly as expected, but maybe I will order it \"dry\" instead of \"gravy\" during my next visit. Service was good, ambience was ok, but this is a place you'd want to go for food rather than anything else. In a nut shell, I highly recommend this place and to try their Tibetan offerings. For me it was one of the best Tibetan foods I have had in my recent memory."}
{"text":"**Adding an extra star because my friends overall were satisfied with the food, and the restaurant followed up with me and apologized for the service. Though I was not impressed, I feel it's important to always note how my party felt (though they should be writing their own reviews and sharing their perspective!)  I am not going to sit here and pretend to know about Tibetan and Indian Hakka cuisine, but being a lover of food in general, I was game to try Norling when a friend suggested it on Halloween night 2015. Specifically, Norling is a small restaurant located in Parkdale, and their menu consists of Tibetan and Indian Hakka cuisine. Most dishes are under $10 (items with seafood cost around $13), and the menu is pretty broad and split into the following sections:  Appetizers Soup Beef Chicken Pork Seafood Vegetable Rice & Noodles Tibetan Specialties Momo Lunch Specialties Thukpa  There were several dishes on the menu that I knew about absolutely nothing about, so let me tell you a bit about them (according to my trusted friend Wiki).  Momo - is a type of dumpling native to Tibet, traditionally filled with yak meat (long-haired animal found in the Himalaya region of southern Central Asia, the Tibetan Plateau and as far north as Mongolia and Russia) and eaten with a variety of sauces. It is similar to Chinese bao and jiaozi (dumpling), Mongolian buuz, Japanese gyoza, Turkic mantu and Korean mandu. In Nepal and bordering regions of India, momos are typically filled with ground and seasoned water buffalo meat. Momos are served hot with tomato and sesame sauce usually seasoned with ground peanut, Sichuan pepper (timur), and cilantro.  Thukpa -  is a Tibetan noodle soup. It originated in the eastern part of Tibet.  Gyuma - is a blood sausage made with yak or sheep's blood in Tibetan cuisine. Rice or roasted barley flour can be added as a filler. The sausage uses natural yak or sheep casing (intestine).  Okay, so now that we have that out of the way, let me tell you about my experience...  My friends and I arrived at around 6PM and there were several tables available. We sat down and were given menus. We browsed the menu and had questions about several items, but staff seemed too busy to come by and check-in with us. The restaurant was not full so we did not understand why we had to wait so long. Once someone finally came over to take our orders (my friend had to waive down a waitress), I found it difficult to get answers to our questions. So I played it safe and ordered the chili chicken without the sauce (as you know, I hate onions and the sauce was inundated with them). The other items that we ordered were:  Momo (beef) Gyuma Chili Chicken w/ Sauce Hot & Sour Soup Langsha Shamo (beef with mushrooms) Verdict...  I was not impressed.  Chili Chicken - My dish came with rice - period. I did like the spice on the chicken, but other than that, there was nothing special about it. I tried a piece of chicken with the sauce, and it did not help the dish to me - I preferred it dry because this way the spices were not hidden or overshadowed by the sauce. I really wanted to try the tingmo (steamed bread) but after trying to get our waitress' attention for 10 minutes, I scrapped that plan.  Momo - one friend used to eat momos in India on a regular basis and was excited to try the momos here, and was sadly disappointed. After receiving the momos she was patiently waiting for them to bring out the sauce that one is generally supposed to have with momos, and after 10 minutes of radio silence, she called our waitress and she admitted to having forgotten the sauce. Once she brought out the sauce my friend told me not to even bother trying it since it was all wrong. I was not planning on trying a momo anyway because as everyone points out, I am the only person they know that hates onions with a passion - and the stuffing in momos has onions. The friend that was trying momos for the first time enjoyed them - but he had no terms of reference to use for comparison.  Langsha Shamo - We all tried the langsha shamo, and again, nothing special. I only had a couple of bites and found it bland, chewy, and boring.  Gyuma - the blood sausage was a hit among my friends. Who knew?! They found it to be full of flavor and not dry as it looked.  Hot & Sour Soup - just confirmed with my friend and he described it as, \"quite flavorful.\"  In Sum...  To be perfectly honest, writing this review was difficult for me because I had a hard time remembering the meal. All that kept crossing my mind as I thought back to that evening were the words \"boring\" and \"average.\" And that is an unusual feeling for a cuisine I have never tried before. Generally with cuisine that I don't indulge in often, I either love it or hate it. Almost never falls in the middle. Sad to say that I have no plans on ever going back to Norling. Though this experience was not ideal, I do plan to give Tibetan and Indian Hakka cuisine another shot sometime soon."}
{"text":"The food was good and so was the service. It was our first time having Tibetan food so we didn't really know what to expect. The momo was very good. I love dumplings. I tried the Tibetan butter tea for the first time. It was interesting, but you grow tired of it quickly... maybe it would be better to serve less or in little cups. My bf had some sausage appetizer that he loved and I ordered the beef with mushrooms meal. Everything was good, but nothing to go crazy over. It seems we just weren't super into this kind of cuisine. However, the service was fantastic and the food tasty."}
{"text":"my first Hakka experience, WoW  Food was flavorful and fresh, service was great and the decor suited the price range and the cuisine (it wasnt bad but this is not a resto that focuses on decor, they focus on food!).  Had the manchurian veg., chili chicken and the cauliflower to start, was impressed with all the dishes, especially the vegetarian dish. Chopped cabbage, carrots and other vegetables formed into deliciously moist balls and sauteed in a wonderful spicy sauce.  food is great, i look forward to coming back , perhaps witha bigger group so we can order a wide variety of dishes to share. this is a great place to get lots to try, have a few beers and talk the night away with great friends."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times now. The owner is very nice and tries to go out of his way for customers.  The prices are very cheap here. The food is good as long as your open to try new food. The staples are also good like their steamed momos, chili chicken etc.  Their lunch specials are amazing value for your money."}
{"text":"Loved the veggie momos and the vegetable manchurian. Try the fried cauliflower too!  Friendly place and true comfort food."}
{"text":"This place has veggie momos!! What's more, they're delicious! My husband and I went for dinner around 6PM and were seated immediately. The hostess was very gracious. They serve a complimentary poppadum-like fried dish, which is great especially if you're hungry. I ordered the vegetarian manchurian and my husband ordered the Norling chilli chicken. My dish was excellent and my husband said his chicken was great, though be wished it was spicier! Both main courses were substantial in quantity and came with steamed rice. The momos had about 8 pieces and I am going to eat it as a main course next time. For one starter and 2 main courses, we paid 31$ only. Great service, good food, decent ambience! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Weak flavours. 'Salad' was a plate of sliced onions, carrots, and daikon. The Momos were very good."}
{"text":"I was disappointed after my visit given the great reviews on here.  Service  Great. Friendly.   Location Lots of parking. Clean place.   Food Cheap but not cheery. Had the chili chicken...but no chilli taste and so boring. No flavor. Needs salt or something. The beef momo was okay but not amazing. The blood sausage was nice and spicy. Overall I wasnt really impressed. The chili chicken, i had two bites. They need to revamp that dish."}
{"text":"Delicious, Hakka and Tibetian influenced  cuisine. We ordered chef's special chowmein, chilli chicken and momos! Oh those momos! So yummy! Just the right amount of meat and filling and dough! Then we got these sumo- sized momos which were also so good.  The staff is pretty nice and while Parkdale isn't the hip area of the city, this  place is easy to find just east of Roncy.  Go and check it out. It's not too pricey and a real delight when you crave some good Hakka."}
