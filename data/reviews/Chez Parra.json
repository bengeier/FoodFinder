{"text":"Très bon restaurant, dans un quartier à découvrir. Le jarret d'agneau est excellent. Le plateau de tapas est aussi très bon, notamment pour les gens qui aiment le fromage de chèvre. Pour dessert, la crème brûlée était aussi très bonne, servie avec une bonne quantité de fruits sur le dessus. Un couple assis près de nous a essayé la tarte tatin; l'homme lui a donné 9/10 et la femme, 6/10.  Le restaurant bénéficie d'une belle petite terrasse à l'avant, et de ce qu'on pourrait appeler une semi-terrasse à l'arrière."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Traditional French style cooking with a modern twist. Especially good are the lamb shoulder and ParraBurger. Very tender meet with tasty sauce on the lamb, and the fois gras in the burger was also great. The desserts are beautiful and well done. Waiters and staff are also very friendly and accommodating. Portions are quite large so come on an empty stomach or be prepared to take something home!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today.  It was amazing!  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Great service, excellent food.  Had seafood ravioli.  I live in Montreal and went to Longueil to visit a church and stumbled upon this restaurant.  I will be back with my husband.  Merci to the excellent chef and his wife!"}
{"text":"Accueil amicale, le service excellent, les plats sont délicieux et les portions sont raisonnables."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night. Maitre de invited us in for the $20 three-course as we were walking by, even though we thought we may not have been appropriately dressed, and with three kids in tow. They were the only kids in the restaurant, but the staff could not have been more accommodating. Very happy with the food and the experience. Merci!"}
{"text":"Just returned from our dinner at Chez Parra after visiting several of the neighborhoods within Montreal, but our hotel is across the river, so we wanted to finish the evening closer to home.  Could not have been more pleased with the steak and frites.  Service is very friendly and attentive, it was a lovely summer evening with lots of folks out and about so we enjoyed every aspect of the experience.  The owner seemed to know everybody in his restaurant and we left feeling like we'd found a new place for dinner, if we ever make it back up here--two of us are from Kansas and two are from Sweden.    Emjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good food and nice location in the old Longueuil. Very good French food. The foie gras is very good."}
{"text":"Restaurant Chez Parra is a great little French restaurant in Longueuil, Quebec, which is a suburb of Montreal on the South Shore, just across the waters form that thriving international city.  It is long and narrow, with a Salon Prive (private room) in the rear, which our party of 6 occupied, amidst original art decorating the walls. The ambiance is simple, understated, casual elegance and cozy.   The menu has traditional French specialities, such as Foie Gras for appetizer, and mains like Duck l'Orange, Veal, and even Rabbit. There are a few other mediterranean infuences like Canelloni and Carpaccio from Italy and  Paella from Spain, and they have several seafood selections like more than one salmon and a trout dish, as well as other popular meat favorites.  They have a very affordable 3 course daily  evening special, with appetizer, main and dessert for under $24 CAD (under $20 USD at today's exchange) and most of the entrees a la carte are $18 - $24 CAD,with appetizers in the $6 - $10 CAD range.  They have an adequate wine selection appropriate for their food offerings.   Service is very attentive, with the owner/manager  providing personalized suggestions and service.   This is mostly a hidden, affordable gem for locals, but if you are ever in Longueuil or along the south shore of Montreal, this would be an excellent, affordable choice for good local French food."}
{"text":"Very nice. Visited on a business trip and found the food very tasty. The chocolate mousse was a fantastic closer for the meal. The owner was very friendly and personable, but not pushy. Altogether a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I ate at this cozy little restaurant last week and couldn't have been more impressed.  This is a place where you can relax over a great meal and a nice bottle of wine.  I don't speak or read French (yet) and as soon as my waiter realized that he took the time to translate almost the entire menu for me.  No rolling eyes, no arrogance and no irritation.  I started with the fried calamari which was almost a meal in itself!  No small French portions here!  I forget the name of the main course but it had 3-4 meats and beans in a casserole dish...also a very healthy portion.  My waiter suggested a Chilean wine to start and it was amazing.  I finished with another recommended wine that was a little drier but excellent as well.  Wish I had left room for desert because it looked delicious!! Atmosphere was light and inviting. Crown was a mixture of locals ranging from 26-80 and not overly loud. Staff was attentive, friendly and accommodating.  I would call Chez Parra a $$$ restaurant rather than the listed $$.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"We had a very nice time here.   Our waitstaff was very accommodating when they realized we didn't speak French and gave us an English menu.   Excellent service and the food was delicious!  Will definitely return next time in Montreal area."}
