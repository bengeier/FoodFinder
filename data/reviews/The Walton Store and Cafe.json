{"text":"Great food, great people! Love this place! Brisket and burgers are great! Fresh cut fries (thick) were very nice as well! Biscuits and gravy were delicious and portion was huge! Job well done, I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Very friendly folks, comfy vibe,  great service and great food. Full plate of biscuits and gravy for cheap! Good luck as you build your business around your passion!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some drinks and greeted by the most friendly staff. You must try the breakfast."}
{"text":"What a dump!  This does not even come close to being called a dive.
Crack and marijuana pipes for sale, old records on the wall and a very poorly
maintained building and property.  And to boot, its all for sale!  
We just happened to stop at the Halfway Cafe next door for breakfast this morning
and it looked interesting so I went in..... oh my.  The food may claim to be good, but it is
so trashy looking and does not have a kitchen, just some mismatched counters
and a crock pot.
Not good for a family visit with all the \"paraphernalia\" on display when you walk 
in the door."}
{"text":"Food was ultra good. The lady who made it was amazingly friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was good. We did find the small amount of food strange, but understandable. 
The bad was right when you walk in try have a large pipe counter to buy crack and marijuana pipes. Not really a family good atmosphere with that."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove out to this place today to try out their burgers and fries Absolutely Yummy hope they keep kickin out great goodies"}
{"text":"Excellent, chickens are fun. Should be on TV. We had the brisket and the hamburger, all freshly made before our eyes......"}
{"text":"Everything made fresh to order! Actual potatoes cut in front of me for fries! Red is a likable fella as well!"}
