{"text":"Very disappointed. Work at an office with scheduled lunch and they said they would be serving from 11-130. Truck sat for an hour closed till 1130 causing employees to not be able to get lunch that we're waiting. I was able to get the avo toast that showed with sweet potato chips on the menu but I was given stail tortilla chips. $7 for trash. Only part I enjoyed was the coconut. But it was opened on the floor and had dirt on it. Horrible experience"}
{"text":"I LOVE this truck!  I had their gorgeous Acai bowl, and enjoyed every bit of it!  I was seriously tempted to lick the bowl! All of their ingredients are super fresh and healthy. I can't wait to try the Pitaya bowl next time!"}
{"text":"Love Acai is by far the best Acai Bowl place in town! You can tell that She puts a lot of work into making sure that each bowl tastes delicious! I would recommend to anyone in search of the BEST Acai bowls in town!"}
{"text":"My employer has a food truck at work every Thursday and I was a bit surprised when I saw that it was serving Acai and avocado toast. Doesn't sound filling to me! The lady assured me that the bowls are filling so I took a chance and ordered the peanut butter Acai bowl. I was instantly hooked! The bowls are pricey at $10 a bowl but worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Yes this word is often over used but not in this case. I would say it the best Acai bowl I have had in the valley and in the Arcadia area in general. Follow them on instagram so you can keep up with the yumminess of this food truck. Oh and the owner is wonderful and will go out of her way to make sure  you enjoy your bowl:)"}
{"text":"Recently had my first experience with this food truck at a special event at a clothing store. I had a fresh raw coconut while we waited in the 100+ degree weather and it was so delicious and refreshing! Later, I got an Acai bowl. Not only was it very delicious but so fresh and beautiful! It's obvious that they take the time to make every bowl just right instead of slopping it together when they're busy. Next time they're nearby, I will def go grab one!"}
