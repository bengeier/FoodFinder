{"text":"Joy Bistro is a beautiful, sophisticated resto just inside Leslieville on Toronto's East side. It's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage. It's become somewhat of a Leslieville landmark.  First things first, I've heard a lot of negative comments about this place. By the sounds of it, it's one of those places that's hit-or-miss and completely different from one visit to the next; amazing one time, awful the next. Because I've never had dinner there, I can't vouch for evening dining, but I can say this: if you truly don't want run the risk of being disappointed, stick with their weekend brunch. This place is known for brunch. While they may have their issues, Joy Bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of style.  Brunch at Joy Bistro is not really bistro-ish. The brunch food here is mostly just what you'd expect to see on a brunch menu in most Toronto restaurants, but they do their brunch stuff particularly well. Eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like Benetine (with spinach and peameal bacon), Norwegien (with stacked smoked salmon), and Teddy (with peameal bacon, roasted tomatoes, and spinach). With their near-perfect hollandaise, eggs benny at Joy Bistro is a solid choice.  That, and they've got a killer patio. Intimate and relaxing, their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences. Leslieville has got a few patio spots, but for sheer space, warmth, and location sitting on a busy little Leslieville corner overlooking Jimmie Simpson Park, Joy Bistro's patio is in a league of its own. Worth the sit down in the summer.  They've recently undergone mass renos, which has resulted in Joy Bistro Bar. Although this may have helped the space modernize, it's also contributed to changing their clientele base. Neighbourhood locals that frequented Joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over. I guess as Leslieville becomes more popular, Joy Bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood, and while change can be good, in most cases, if it isn't broke them why fix it?  Despite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch. So the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to Joy Bistro for brunch on the patio. By the sounds of it though, I certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch."}
{"text":"We always come here for Brunch! The \"Smoked Salmon, Asparagus Eggs Benedict\" is TO DIE FOR!!!!!!! This is a new addition to the brunch menu. I believe Joy Bistro changed their menu a few months ago. The meal touches all of your taste buds! I loved the tangy taste of the pickled onion salad with the asparagus.   I didn't give Joy Bistro 5 stars because the service was a bit slow. The food is the best though."}
{"text":"The food was different and Okay. Went for lunch heard it was better for dinner and break They give you suggested tipping prices on the machines 15%, 20%, and 25%"}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about joy bistro and went today for weekend brunch. After 2 cups of weak coffee, and over an hour of waiting for scrambled eggs and eggs Bennie we were told that our order was lost. We and two other tables got up and left. I guess we'll never know how the breakfast is. The environment was great, but based on the drink service (had to chase our waitress down repeatedly) and the fact that we had to ask after an hour before they realized there was no food coming to a whole section I'm not planning on giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Food great! Overall love the place. Service ok but not exceeding expectations. Coffee horrible."}
{"text":"Attempted to spice up a sad rainy weekend with a famous Leslieville brunch.  We decided to try an old friend, Joy Bistro. I had not visited the bar since it's reno.  The place looks great, the food....esh, disappointing.   It was a hectic day, but we were seated right away.  Had some trouble with the creamers, yet fresh coffee was provided quickly.   Great service from all of the wait staff, as always; however, the food, was another story.   I had a simple breakfast.  Simple in the sense that you couldn't mess it up - eggs and sausage.    The home fries were burnt....and the sausages were dry and tasteless.  Big thumbs down.  Even more because my coffee cup spent much of the visit to Joy's empty.    My friend had the Eggs Teddy.  It was soooo bland.   I'm disappointed that this old favourite is now definitely off the list.  The restaurant has such a gorgeous patio in the summer.  And 2.50 drinks from 5-7.  All and all, with the plethora of choices along Queen, Joy will no longer bring joy to my stomach.   Cheers to the service. Boo to the food.  Breaking up is hard to do.   No gluten free options.   Sausages were safe. Rowe Farms."}
{"text":"Let me just say that they had the best apple cider in all of the GTA.  We got lucky, there was no lineup we came into the elegance of the old Ch√¢teau crossed with some new Belgian flair. The food was five out of five across-the-board we tried two different Benedict meals, and one breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try Joy Bistro after having boycotted the place for the last couple years for lousy service and mediocre menu offerings.  But I am so happy I decided to give it another try.   They completely renovated and not just the decor.  The menu is so much more interesting and diverse. The service was attentive and friendly. My dinner date and I shared a delightful lobster quesadilla to start, and I gobbled up every last bit of my purple carrot risotto with goat cheese.  When I saw that the Vionier was only sold by the bottle, the server told me it would be no problem to give me just a glass.  I will definitely try Joy again soon. Wow, I am actually blown away by the improvements.  Congrats Joy!"}
{"text":"Just came back from this place.  I like this place simply because of its location and patio seating.  The food is so-so, nothing bad nor good to say about it.    Good place to mingle with family and friends."}
{"text":"I met some friends for brunch last weekend and it was good. We sat on the patio which was great. I've only been there from brunch a few times to eat with friends that live in the area so I can't really comment on the rest of their menu. It is basic brunch food.  Our server was nice and made sure that we had lots of coffee and it wasn't too loud to talk. They were able to accommodate the 5 of us & my friend found parking on the street (when does THAT ever happen on the Westend?)   Wow, I was reading the other reviews about sh*tty service and apparently, we won the lottery last Sunday :D I'll rub it in by saying that she even packed up the 1/2 pancake that wasn't eaten by the little girl at our table. They made her feel very special instead of giving us grief for wrapping up a scrap of a pancake. It is for this reason that I'm giving this place 3 stars.   **A decent place to go for Sunday brunch on Queen East on the Eastend**"}
{"text":"Booked Joy for an impromptu dinner with friends that ended up being 9 people. They were accommodating on the day of the booking for this number. It was a Tuesday night on a warm day in Summer - I had requested the patio but we were sat upstairs - luckily because it poured with rain during the dinner.   The new owners have just taken over. I had a query about a few things and the owner came and spoke to me directly - nice touch.   Food was so/so - would be good for lunch. We had the Malbec Reserve which was DELICIOUS. Chocolate cake dessert is disappointing. Cheesecake is a bit better. Sandwiches are great (again, would have been ideal for lunch).  Others who ordered main sized meals were disappointed with the small size.   It will be interesting to see how Joy evolves with the new owners.  It's a great space with loads of potential.    I would recommend the upstairs space for functions and large groups."}
{"text":"Have been here 2 times - very quaint, nice location, cute patio, annoying wasps out there in the summer months, but I guess there's not much u can do about that.   My boyfriend and i went yesterday for brunch -  The food is very good, tasty and fresh - I had the smoked salmon asparagus eggs benedict - very fresh and yummy. Salmon was delicious He had the free run egg omelette I believe - it was good   It was pretty full when we arrived, minor wait, seated shortly. Service was meh Wobbly table, causing coffee to spill on more than one occasion, once right in front of our server who did nothing to wipe it up for us.  My bf's espresso was warmish.  No one came to refill out waters, or ask me for coffee, until he had to flag her down  Food took quite a long time to arrive   Think we'll wait awhile before heading back"}
{"text":"You know that feeling when you really really want to love someone but they just dont let you because they constantly forget to shower or change their clothes? Joy Bistro and I have THAT relationship.   I give up on it with this winterlicious lunch.  First Course: Did that dry crostini not end up on my table again?! This time around, with a pukey green colour runny spread laden with eggplant seeds as if they were going out of style.   Second Course: Roast Beef Sandwich. Joy, my dear, if youre listening, when you write ingredients such as swiss cheese, apple mayo and rye bread on your menu, youre supposed to actually put them in the eventual product. All I got were thick leather like pieces of fat with a sprinkle of meat on them. The only hint of mustard on my sandwich came from the actual mustard seeds on the bread. The one thing missing: any semblance of taste.   Third Course: Apple Lady's apple cake.  Again, the honey ice cream mentioned in the menu went for a walk. However, the apple cake was light and perfectly sweetened. The slightly bigger than normal portion made for great leftovers.  The only thing I loved about this experience was our waitress's pink eye shadow."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about Joy Bistro. This is one of the better places for a good weekend brunch. We arrived there at noon and sat at a table on the patio. It was hard to choose from their list of appetizing dishes but finally settled on the Hogtown eggs benedict and Leslieville eggs benedict. The Hogtown presented a nice twist on the traditional English muffin base, using a cheddar and jalapeno biscuit instead. While the bread was taken out completely on the Leslieville and replaced with a nice bed of rosti potatoes. Each plate came with a simple side salad which makes one feel less guilty for indulging in comfort foods laced with rich sauces. Nonetheless, both meals were delicious in their own right and dare I say better than the much boast about Lady Marmalade and Bonjour Brioche!? Overall experience was positive and would go back again. Yes, definitely save yourself the hour line up and opt for this place instead."}
{"text":"This is a story of how NOT to treat customers. This will be long because I don't like to give low scores without just cause.  We invited our friends out to Joy Bistro, and I booked a reservation ahead of time (and still have the confirmation email to prove it). We heard the food was decent and wanted to try for ourselves.  When we arrived, our friends were already there and seated upstairs. They said there was another party with a reservation under my SO's name and nothing when they gave my name. Not realizing the error, they were seated under this person's reservation. That party arrived and was seated beside us. Our friends offered to switch tables and the other party declined.  Okay, oops. There was a reservation mix-up. No harm, no foul because everyone still managed to get seated and no one was upset. Or so we thought!  Problems arose when our server came back repeatedly (at least 3-4 times) to ask us if we had a reservation, even going so far as to ask us if we walked in off the street and stole someone's reservation. (!!!) He was quite upset at this point.  He then agreed that a reservation existed under my name and said that our table was specially reserved for another group to be seated, so we needed to move. When we pointed out that the table we had our mix up with was already seated beside us, he then said there was another reservation with the same name and number of people. I'm pretty sure he was lying.  He told us that we would need to move to a table that was not yet set up. At first we agreed, but immediately came to a group consensus that he was treating us so disrespectfully and with such rudeness, that we were no longer interested in patronizing the restaurant. We were patronized enough by the waiter!  We told him that we would no longer require the table, and he started telling other diners that we were leaving because we were too upset. He really needed to bring down his drama level, and not bring in random strangers to the mix. He was incredibly unprofessional. My only regret is that I did not ask to speak with the manager at the time to explain why we were leaving.  This is a faithful narrative of my experience at Joy Bistro. How sad for everyone, from diner to restaurant owner."}
{"text":"The only real reason to go to Joy Bistro is the patio. It's an ideal place to have a beer on a nice day. If you elect to order food to go with your patio beer the experience will be diminished as the food is boring, bland and not inexpensive. Never eat inside here, there is no conceivable reason to do such a thing given all of the better food options around."}
{"text":"Great place together with friends for dinner or drinks. The menu has lots to choose from and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great for brunch especially in the summer with multiple patio options."}
{"text":"This is first visit.  I read quite a few of review and said that the service is a bit of awful, but it's all OK for my visit.    For the food, I like it.  Waffle and Omelet are all fresh and tasty with nice presentation.  I guess compare to the price and service level, I think it is good enough for me to go a second time."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I've never had their evening menu but as far as I'm concerned the day begins and ends with their brunch.  A delightful atmosphere that has an odd calming affect when you walk through the door - particularly if you are seated upstairs which is a very open space with plenty of light.  Super friendly staff, lovely decor, blah blah blah, bling bling blah blah...  Let's get serious and talk about their food!  Cheesy Eggs -- why am I even continuing? Sheer perfection! Eggs Benny -- not as amazing as Le Petit Dejeuner but lovely all the same. Bacon -- it's always a gamble when ordering bacon with my brunch. I won't kick any bacon out of bed, no matter where it falls on the crispy meter but I honestly like my bacon a little floppy and a lotty fatty. Check. Mate!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch here last Sunday. My favourite part? Absolutely no line up. We were seated immediatley.   Their waffles are incredible! A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I'll be frank--all I care about is the patio.  Is there ample seating?  Is it comfortable?  Will friendly waiters bring me drinks as soon as I sit down?  Am I going to be staring into the sun whenever I try to meet my friends' eyes?  At Joy, the answers are yes, yes, yes, and no, which is good enough to earn it a return visit."}
{"text":"Beautiful Sunday morning and we were the neighbourhood to run an errand. Saw Joy Bistro and figured we'd give it a whirl. First impressions are that it's clean and cozy (we were snuggled in between two other twosomes). Server was attentive and prompt. Two thumbs up!  We both decided upon the Leslisville Eggs Benedict. The food presentation was wonderful, two thumbs up.  So I start to eat and get a wee taste of each of the components ketchup free, all very nice indeed but as an addict I need my ketchup, guess what? It's homemade! One thumb up( the wife's not a fan of ketchup ;) )   Two full bellies, two empty plates, two happy customers, two thumbs up. We'll be back  HOT BREAKING NEWS! a few moments after I posted this review I was approached by our wonderful server who enquired if I was \"Nigel\" I confirmed my identity and she advised they were going to send us home with a wee treat, now don't you all go expecting this but it shows they read the reviews and care about the customer. The power of positive works people. Be nice!"}
{"text":"I have been to Joy a number of times for both brunch, drinks or dinner - even a wedding! I like Joy. It is comfortable, unpretentious and reasonably priced. It is not gourmet,  but we've always had good service (I've been 6 to 8 times) and although dinner was just average, brunch has always been pretty decent. If you are looking for trendy and different, go to Lady Marmalade a couple doors down and wait in line longer than you should ever wait for breakfast. Go to Joy if you want to eat a hearty breakfast (a step or two up from a diner) and you want to eat immediately. Joy always has room because it has two floors. People have complained and I have had the odd, under par experience, but generally the service and food is of a consistent quality. Ambience is perfect for brunch as well with a view of the park."}
{"text":"Joy has tasty vegetarian options, which is a refreshing change. I had the tofu curry, a hearty dish loaded with veggies and spiced just right."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place for quite some time but I was pleasantly surprised when we dropped in with a group of 7 moms.  The service was amazing. They accommodated us with high chairs, stroller parking, and messy babies.   They served us a complimentary chocolate waffle with whipped cream and butterscotch drizzle. This tasted heavenly. There were unlimited coffee refills and the food was good.  I ordered the burger and fries and it was fresh, well seasoned, good overall.  The bill was under $20 for lunch. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Joy Bistro and the OverJoy probably 6-8 times for brunch with family/friends or with a large group of people. Unfortunately, it recently changed ownership and a recent request to book the upstairs room for a Sunday brunch for 40+ people was turned down so we were forced to seek out another resto that could accommodate a large group-Thank you Richtree! When it came to dealing with a large group we experienced a few bumps at first with understaffing and long wait times for food but eventually they worked it all out. Too bad we won't be going there again. The decor, especially upstairs, is absolutely lovely. I even tried to book the upstairs for my engagement party a few years ago but it was just too pricey with a minimum cost required. Again, I took my business elsewhere. The brunch food is decent but can be a little bit salty. Staff is generally friendly."}
{"text":"Low key, delicious brunch. Great granola and yogurt. Lived the hashbrowns. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch today and were lucky to have a taste of a few items on their menu...  Waffles: amazing!!!!  We followed it up with eggs leslieville (which I highly recommend) while my husband went straight for eggs Quebec.  The latter is basically a breakfast poutine and he enjoyed it to the last bite.  Their gluten free menu is extensive and you don't have to compromise on flavour at all. I added a sausage and gf toast and was pleasantly surprised by the home-made jam.    I've been to Joy before but it had been a few years.  The new owners have really kicked this place up a notch and I can't wait to try the dinner menu (and the breakfast poutine!). Staff was super pleasant  - overall a great brunch"}
{"text":"Held our reception at The Joy, in the upstairs room.  Shauna and Geoff were very accommodating, helping us set up a menu. The reception menu has many choices. We went for 2 salads-goat cheese and quinoa, carved roast beef (excellent) roast potatoes, chicken and a risotto station (really well received). Our guests raved about the food.  Served buffet style and everything was warm and well prepared. Prior to dinner, we had passed hot and cold appetizers.  The serving and bar staff were excellent-personable and professional. We had 50 guests, with table seating for everyone. After dinner, they took away one large table and there was enough room for dancing. We chose to bring our own wine and pay corkage.  Overall, we were very pleased with the venue, the service, food and the price. We've eaten at the Joy several times, for dinner and for brunch.  Sometimes, I feel the menu is a bit limited as there's several items that are just a bit too different for my tastes, but their reception menu is very nice."}
{"text":"Joy Bistro is yet another lovely option for a night out in Leslieville, or for brunch.   Again have been here numerous times since I moved into the neighbourhood in 2001--for brunch, but most often for dinner--and over the years it has changed for the better in my humble opinion.  Have to say the best experience I ever had was last November when my transatlantic boyfriend and I decided to drop in and ended up having what I would have to call a sumptuous dining experience with a really fantastic bottle of red wine.  Sorry I'm not great with details, more of a general flavourist if you will, so I cannot tell you what we had. But it was good!   Since then I've been a couple of times and most recently for Summerlicious where I had a Waldorf-type salad, steak with this amazing cauliflower-corn au gratin, and lemon curd for dessert. Wow.   Service is wonderful, ambiance is lovely.  This is a good place to go if you'd like to have a conversation with someone.  The open patio attached with Joy Bistro is also a really pleasant place to have a drink, relax and enjoy life."}
{"text":"I really want to love Joy Bistro... It's located a stone's throw away from my apartment, it has an outdoor patio right beside a park, and is slotted into a busy and quirky intersection at Queen and Logan with plenty to see and do... I really want this place to be wonderful.   Unfortunately, it's just \"meh\". I've been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch, and on both occasions was really stuck for something to order - and I'm not fussy. In my (again, non fussy) opinion, there simply were very few tasty yet healthy options on the menu here.   The food on both occasions underwhelmed me, for the price I paid. This place isn't cheap compared to its local competitors. $30 before tip for two brunch/breakfast entrees and an americano.   The service I found pleasant and fast, and I love the comfy sofa booths at the front of the restaurant. There's generally a nice laid back atmosphere here, and I still wouldn't hesitate to grab a coffee and cake here to relax in the patio on a hot summer's day.  However, until their menu expands and general taste of their quirky recipes improves, I'll stick to coffee and cocktails when visiting."}
{"text":"Bad service. Mediocre food. Good coffee. Trying to get a refill on that coffee is a challenge. See point number 1."}
{"text":"Sad to say this place is going downhill. I live in the area, and have been coming for years. It's basically Lady Marmalade's waiting room or overflow room, so they don't really need to impress with service or quality anymore - just make it up in volume. And it shows. The food used to be mediocre, and now it is subpar. If you want any evidence of this, check out the ever-present lineups next door, and the groaning souls who come to Joy because they couldn't get in next door. The service is abysmal. I've had more attention paid to me at Spadina and College."}
{"text":"This is one of the two restaurants I used my credit card while visiting Toronto. About three weeks after my visit there, charges of over $20,000 appeared on my card. Someone there might be \"skimming\" the numbers of the card. BUYERS BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Food - blah.   Atmosphere - smelled slightly mouldy and the furniture has seen better days.  I'm generally an asshole about non-chain restaurants that make no attempt to rise above 'below average'.     With so many other great restaurants in the area, I have no idea why this place does any business.   Perhaps, the cool patio on the side draws people in on a beautiful summer's day like a diabolic mirage in the desert."}
{"text":"Came here to avoid the brunch lineups everywhere else in the area. The food wasn't anything special but also wasn't bad. The Berkshire pork sausage was a dry but had good flavoring. The maple bacon was delicious but needed to cook a bit longer.   The waiter forgot to put both orders in but, to make up for it, we were given a decent sized bowl of fruit.   I wouldn't rush back here for brunch but would come back to avoid the lineups."}
{"text":"Brunch was very good as was the service and the ambiance if, unremakable. Safe bet,"}
{"text":"Had a reservation there today for a birthday brunch. The place is closed, windows covered in paper! Why are they taking reservations on Yelp?"}
{"text":"Other reviewers have pretty well nailed it.  Mediocre brunch.  Food was so-so.   I had the pancakes - they were fine, a bit doughy, but the texture was actually not too bad, and they were tasty.  However, some pet peeves: we were a large group, seated upstairs.  There were only a few other tables, and it seemed like 2 servers, but they were never anywhere to be found.... waits for water (or anything for that matter), seemed excruciatingly long.  We were there 1/2 hour before we got menus.  They wouldn't split the bill... sure I know lots of places won't, but it just seemed like the type of place that would/should.   Lattes were warm but not hot.    At one point I noticed a bug (I think it was just a little ant) crawling on the table, and I can't make sense of where it came from... kind of weird.  I killed it quick and got it off the table before any of my dining companions noticed.    It was fine, but definitely nothing special.  Seems that the reviews are consistent in that regard."}
{"text":"After giving up on marmalade due to the long line up, which is just next door, we ended up at this less busy brunch restaurant.  Went in with low expectation but pleasantly surprised with the quality delicious breakfast! Server was attentive and accommodating and our food was served in a timely fashion.  Was I disappointed that we didn't go to marmalade? Yes. But Joy is definitely a good alternative! Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Always a good spot.  Especially enjoyed the \"B Side\" patio and new tapas style menu.  Highly recommend the dates or the beef skewers.  A great spot for sunny afternoon hangout.  The inside renos have given the downstairs much more of a bar type atmosphere, which I feel was much needed.  A good, solid Leslieville staple."}
{"text":"Went today for brunch after getting sick of waiting in line in the rain at Lady Marmalade. Now I know why there wasn't a wait at this place....the service is terrible and the menu is super limited.   I ordered a coffee and my husband ordered a latte. While the coffee came right away (small cup, didn't taste very good) the latte took a good 15 minutes of us just sitting at the table trying to focus on something else other than how hungry we were.   Finally the latte came and we put in our orders. We then had to wait a good 20-30 minutes for our meals to come out. The food was pretty underwhelming and the potato/fries were the only decent part. I had the Norwegian Benedict and my husband had the Breakfast on a sandwich. We both actually felt sick after the meal...I think the eggs may have been bad or something...not sure. Definitely never going back to this place."}
{"text":"Dinnertime.  Appetizers and mains were good and on par for what I expected.  Service was very good - all staff we interacted with with friendly.  Interior is warm and cozy.  Only thing bad was the sparkling/champagne was flat."}
{"text":"Attended Joy Bistro on what likely appeared to be one of the last fall days warm enough to lounge on a patio for a late lunch. Engaged with a pup, Joy Bistro's patio was one of few on the strip that didn't require entrance through the main dining room (phew!)  Staff was very friendly, and easy to accommodate us and our four-legged friend - offering us beverages and water for the pooch. While our beagle's thirst was quenched right away with a big bowl of aqua, we wound up waiting a good 15-minutes before our drinks. Loved the prospect of $5 Sunday Ceasar's but wasn't keen on the wait to get drinks/place the order particularly given that we arrived so late in the afternoon (4pm), there were only had a few tables on the go inside and there appeared to be plenty of (friendly, smiley) staff.  Food was excellent and they were happy to accomodate my food allergy and make a tasty Spicy Shrimp Wrap into salad-format to suit me nicely. However, they forgot my soup.. twice, even after a gentle coaxing reminder. At the end, it was kindly offered on the house - thoughtful gesture, but it was already part of my soup/salad-from-sandwich combo.   No complaints with the food but there seems to be a lot of miscommunication among staff. Coming at a slower time doesn't seem to be any guarantee of a better experience - can't imagine the kind of chaos if they were busier!  Bonus points for being pooch friendly BUT minus points for slow death to customer through starvation.  Would give 'em another go in time."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious and sat In the inside patio. Nice place. Awesome deal: 3 courses for $15. The food was delicious and service good. Would be a great dining experience if not for the slow and long wait for food. Nothing was served for 45 mins."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decent service. However, my duck confit was layered with a crust of salt. kind of crunchy actually. If not for the complimentary wine, and discount off total bill,  this place will be a 1 star."}
{"text":"Joy Bistro is a neighborhood staple overlooking Jimmie Simpson park in Leslieville. Popular for brunch, I have visited on several occasions, spaning several years, and have definitely formed an opinion about Joy.   Recently renovated, Joy and the Upstairs Over Joy primarily serve the same fare as pre-reno. Not disappointing, and not overly impressive safe everyday food.   My most recent visit was for brunch, and I found the eggs florentine to be ok for $10 and change. The hollandaise was sparse and unremarkable, the eggs nicely cooked but the bed of spinach wet and flavourless. (frozen?)  Their breakfast potatoes are particularly uninspired, always tasting like they have been twice cooked and sat around for a bit.  The service is nice, the ambiance nice, and they have a lovely view from the upstairs windows. Great patios in the summer, and Wednesday $5 pints.  In a neighborhood as brunch-spoiled as Leslieville you have to be prepared to BRING IT. Joy serves its purpose, taking overflow from the busier and full brunch spots nearby, but it just does not WOW by any means. Lunch is equally OK, but kind of pricey.    Consistently boring, safe, but with a nice patio(s). One star for the patios."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Joy Bistro for at least a couple of years.  We liked the food, atmosphere and excellent service. I've previously rated it highly and recommended it.  Not any more.  When we went for dinner this past weekend we discovered it had changed ownership since our last visit. The change has not been for the better.  Service, food and atmosphere have all suffered.  The attitude of the hostess was anything but welcoming.  She couldn't find our reservation.  Then she could.  No apology. We sat downstairs in the bar because most of the dining room had been taken over for a private function.  Again, no apology.  The menu selection has been reduced considerably.  We both had flat iron steak which was good.  My starter of deep fried calamari was also good. But neither was up to the standard of old.  Service was OK.  Sad demise for an old favorite."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner one Saturday with some girlfriends. We opted to order a bunch of things and share them so we could try more options. While the menu is quite small there were so many things that I wanted to eat it was hard to choose! We eat ordered a salad I had the clementine and goat cheese salad, my two girlfriends had the winter Cesar salad. Mine was delicious the vinaigrette was light and refreshing in contrast to the spicy goat cheese. We also ordered the mushroom flatbread, lobster quesadilla, and pulled pork poutine. Everything was delicious, I really have nothing bad to say. The mushroom with the blue cheese was amazing. The au ju from the pulled pork poutine was succulent. Our server was fantastic very attentive. Overall out bill spilt with drinks and a three course meal was only $40. Ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Used to go to Joy's frequently but found the quality of the food has declined. Went there with the family for brunch, thought would give them another chance. Unfortunately the food was just ok. I had the chicken club and it was just dry and lacked any flavour. The pulled pork pork looked promising, but it also lacked favour. The fries and salad were good but that doesn't make a meal.    The manager was nice and did ask for feedback, so hopefully they put some emphasis on food quality."}
{"text":"Walked over to Joy Bistro this morning when my sister and I decided that we didn't want to stand in line for brunch at Lady Marmalade.  Joy Bistro was half empty at 10:30 but it looked nice inside and the menu looked good (5 variations on eggs benny, as well as an omelette and several other options).  We split the first eggs benny option, and the lemon ricotta pancakes.  The pancakes were delicious.  Three stacked pancakes with a lemon sauce between, and a berry compote on top.  Yum.  I live in the west end of the city but I would go back for more of those pancakes.  The eggs benny was good but it would not have been enough food for me if I had ordered that alone (two poached eggs but only one biscuit).  It came with a decent green salad.  The service was good, even though the place got busy by the time we left.  Having just read other yelp reviews I felt compelled to add my own review, as my experience today was nothing like some other reviewers'.  My sister and I loved the place."}
{"text":"I am updating my previous reviews raving about this place because of the following:  This used to be my go to place for Brunch, dinner and lunch. Everything was always yummy and fresh, the service was great and the wine list elaborate. A couple of months ago I took a couple of friends there and as soon as we walked in we noticed a stark change in he service, no one greeted us at the door for over 10 minutes, the hostess and the waitresses were just passing by ignoring the patrons. Then we got a table, now Joy used to always be packed with people, but this time it was a few people here and there. Being a regular there for many years as soon as I saw the menu I was socked, no more steak frits, duck confits, or other yummy French foods, instead they had KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) and few other fried food you'd find at cheap bars not a fine French restaurant. I asked the waitress and she said oooh because it is a slow night the chef has changed the menu, and I believed her! We left the restaurant because out of the 5-6 items that now replaced an elaborate menu we could not find anything we liked to eat. I went back a couple of weeks later, thinking surely they have gone back to their old menu, but the same scenario again! This time I asked the waitress and pressed her to know what is going on? She finally admitted the management had changed and the new owner is taking the restaurant in a new direction. If you ask me, he is taking a fine establishment and making it into a fst food joint! It really bothered me that the waitress lied to our faces before.  I had previously wrote a glowing review of this place, but after this I will never eat there again. I'm just so disappointed that someone took the jewel of Leslievill and replaced it with a combination of McDonald and KFC!"}
{"text":"Went there today for brunch.  They made us wait at the door for 15 minutes while they cleared tables which was a bit of a downer.  I feel like they were understaffed as our waitress seemed a litle frazzled.  Had a tasty egg benedict with tomatoes and spinach which was a nice touch.  Service was lacking but Ill cut them a break and go back to see if it improves."}
{"text":"I love scrambled eggs but don't typically order them as they usually come out as a chopped up omelette.  The cheesy scrambled eggs here were done perfectly though!  We also didn't have to wait for a table, and had great service throughout our meal.  I will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"Although I've had take out lunches from here while working in the area ( on company $), I only went to dinner here recently. I thought the service was slow and unattentive, basically had to beg for a glass of water. And the food was over priced. The food was good but not memorable. I don't think I would come back nor will I partake in those takeout lunches again ( save the company some money)"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised at these negative reviews... I've been to Joy Bistro about 20 times - I frequently go there for business meetings and meals with friends. The food has always been stellar, service friendly and not overbearing (or lazy), atmosphere - perfect. It's one of my favourite places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"A top brunch spot in Leslieville, Joy Bistro has been a safe haven of sorts. No matter who I'm with, friends, family or girlfriend can rely on Joy for providing a solid lunch/brunch/dinner over the past couple years. Service is great and is welcoming."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. The much hyped (by our server at least) $20 prime rib dinner was ordered medium and came overcooked, the accompanying Yorkshire pudding was fridge-cold, and worst of all the one dinner we asked to have held as a takeout order was served to us in the styrofoam container at the same time as our other food.   Won't be back for dinner again. Still want to try brunch and would have drinks on the patios."}
{"text":"The poutine was great but could use more than 3 cheese curds on it. Tacos were okay , and I didn't find enough salt used at times. Over all I was Impressed with the poutine flavour and use of vegetables."}
{"text":"This place has a great patio and is well located near a large park, so very pleasant to sit there. The service was friendly but slow and unresponsive.  HOWEVER, the food is utterly and absolutely disgusting! Went there with my whole family for a Saturday brunch. Ordered smoked salmon eggs benedict, waffles, veggie burger, and a bunch of other stuff. It was barely edible. Eggs served on some sickeningly off colour and mushy potato roti type thing with overaged spinach. Veggie burger burns your mouth, way over-spiced. Waffles soggy on the bottom (from sucking some kind of liquid) and dried out on top. etc. etc.  Bottom line: if you go there, stick to drinks ... although they also managed to serve lemonade without ice (so lukewarm). They just don't bother putting any kind of effort with the food, probably because they know they will get customers regardless because of the patio and location alone. It would be a perfect candidate for one of those restaurant makeover shows where the TV personality yells at the chefs and owners for being lazy or incompetent."}
{"text":"All of the other restaurants in the area are so good that people end up here by default when they can't get into Lil' Baci, Lady Marmalade or Bonjour Brioche. We always say we won't go back but have been back several times because we can't get in anywhere else. The decor is pretty, the patio is nice and the service can be okay but the food just doesn't cut it. I mean if they charged less then it might  be okay but they are charging prices that they should only be charging if the food is good, which it is not. I'd say the food is blah, tasteless -stay at home and cook yourself even if you can't cook!"}
{"text":"I've had this little east end bistro bookmarked for a while. One day last week, I happen to be in the area around lunch time so I decided to pop in for a little snack.  I had the club sandwich with a Caesar salad. The club was delicous, full of melty cheese and bacon. The salad had real pieces of bacon, which is always fantastic.  Joy Bistro is a nice little spot in Leslieville with great service."}
{"text":"There's a reason why Joy Bistro does not have a line-up or busy crowds that Bonjour Brioche / Lady Marmalade have.  On a weekday, our menu consisted only of lunch and appetizers (assumed they only have brunch on weekends). Selection was limited on our menu.  We ordered a baby lettuce salad with salmon ($12) and the clubhouse sandwich ($14) (side salad was tasty).  Quality of food was ok - not amazing, but simple without anything outstanding.  Service was not impressive. Our waiter barely checked on us or provided water refills. Overall, a return to Joy Bistro isn't looking to promising."}
{"text":"I went there on a Sunday morning for brunch.  It was busy but we were seated fairly quickly on the patio. I like how they gave a bottle of water for the table. We had the Goat Cheese, Braised Tomato Eggs Benedict and the Leslieville Eggs Benedict.  Both were very good.   I only gave 3 stars because the service was horrible.  Our waitress was difficult to find for the entire visit.  Although the food was good we left feeling frustrated because of this."}
{"text":"Still a solid three.  I had the Beef Cheek Poutine the other day. It was okay. Ya, the beef was tender and tasty. But the cheese and gravy was meh. The cheese was barely melty and the gravy was really just juice. I like a good sturdy gravy, something that really sticks to the fries. This was more like my fries were sitting in a puddle of coloured water. Meh.   The best part was people watching at a table by the window."}
{"text":"Went to Joy Bistro on a busy Saturday for the patio which is great on both sides. The server was fine in the beginning if a tad disengaged. I ordered the soup of the day and asked specifically if it was spicy, she said no. Sure enough it comes and tastes spicy. Not only that but it was chilled which she never mentioned. I had to send it back  , she said no problem but still put it on the bill.  Also ordered a platter with dips for sharing and the tacos. Fully unimpressive, bland food, very dissapointing. Will not be going back unless its just for a quick drink."}
{"text":"Dunno how the planets were aligned, but I figure this is what happens when the kitchen staff and / or management show up for work high (on some very unproductive drugs).    Inexplicably slow service on an empty-ish night.  Food poorly prepared and almost inedible--like no one went shopping that day and had to scrounge for left-overs...we suspect the wait staff were the only ones trying to hold the shizz down.  We just moved to Leslieville and it was our first time checking out the restos :(  So, it was dinnertime...  Lots of empty seating, but we were told to come back in 15 (?).  So, we, uh, just sat down at an empty table and waited for 20 minutes to get a drink order in.  Then we took time to choose from the menus given to us, but upon ordering were told they were lunch menus, so we had to rethink everything with new dinner ones.  Food was super slow, so we got free fries to carb up for an extra 20 minute wait (point!)  Lamb was the fattiest most disgusting, inedible cut ever.  We sent it back and they were like, \"Yeah, thought so\".  WTF--at $19 or so, 'twas a bit of a harsh gamble on patrons!  Fish tacos were too DIY to be anything special.  Defrosted torillas, dried fishsticks--reminded me of daycare lunch.  Steak was grisly. Had to kind of suck on it to taste it.  Glass of water smelt positively septic--Swimming Prohibited septic.  Then there were the flies that kept coming in, falling all over our food and clothes (it was the first warm night in Toronto of the year).  Not anyone's fault, but just added to the misery.  Just sayin.  Our wait staff knew what kind of ordeal we had been through and at least made up for it with an ice cream / dessert platter.  Whoever is managing and short staffing this place is losing people fast. The servers need to find another job.  But sounds like this problem has persisted for a long time."}
{"text":"This place has a great location.  But the food ranges from okay to really bad.  The fritatta is basically a small and flavourless omlette on a wrap from loblaws.  Cream of tomato soup with basil is incredibly watered down and bland.  Chunks of green don't taste like basil.  The steak sandwich was the one thing we had that wasn't noticeably bad.  Oh - one more thing - our weekday lunch took over two hours!"}
{"text":"Came back here almost two years later for dinner and I can't believe how good the food was.  I've had brunch and lunch here but never dinner- A number of things to say:  -I can't believe it isn't busier here yet.  It looks like Joy is getting LESS of the business of the Leslieville strip. -The ambiance is strange.  In a packed room I'm sure I wouldn't have noticed- but the room was rather empty and I could see the decor for what it was- which felt strangely austere - a tall room with large mirrors and large flat screen tv's- tall tables/benches but also in a small room.  would be a great place to have a packed event - the tall room would make it a nice networking space without it feeling cramped- but in an almost empty resto it felt cold.  Now the food: Still impressed.  I ordered the beef cheeks and I can't believe how good it was.  It was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had.  and the portions are very very generous. I'm a fan. I can't wait for this place to get busier.  I think it will be a hit during the summer months.  oh yes, and the staff are all still very attractive : )"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the past months and the food and service has been great. I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Best patio in Leslieville and they are very dog friendly.  God bless them as they brought out fresh water for my puppy and did not get upset when she went through the fence to sit on my feet.  But that is just the icing on the cake.  They have super friendly staff and very good selection on the menu.  We had the watermelon salad, calamari and curry cauliflower quesadilla.  They were filling and scrumptious.  Calamari was cooked perfectly and the salad was refreshing.  The quesadilla was flavourful, colourful and healthy.  Our drinks were always taken care of and we never wanted for anything at this place.  This is my go to patio this summer and I am so happy to have rediscovered it.  What a joy indeed for this bistro."}
{"text":"I've heard that Joy Bistro keeps going upmarket as the years pass.  At the moment, it's a casual-dressy place decorated in warm colours and elegant lines.  The upstairs, OverJoy, has a more bohemian edge with colourful art, exposed brick, and exuberant chandeliers.  The prices are about right for the ambiance.  The wine list is great - there's a cheap white I'm in love with, which isn't ordered by the LCBO.  The food is mostly excellent -  I had to-die-for beef cheeks, the fish with risotto is delicious, and the steak frites would have been great if they hadn't arrived cold.  The pastas are also very good.  The organic shrimp bisque was not a huge hit with me or my husband, but what do I know about bisque?    I had my wedding reception at OverJoy a couple of years ago, and they were very accomodating.  They goofed on service a bit (the mother & grandmother of the groom hardly got fed at all) but managed gluten and lactose-free requests beautifully.  They also changed the table setup at the last moment, making my seating plan a total wash, but on the whole they were lovely and helpful, and excellent value."}
{"text":"Oh dear.  Disappointing.  In all honesty staff was ok, nothing bad to say really but the place was dead on a Thursday night. They don't sell half bottles of wine and the food was, again, ok. Here's the deal breaker for me. Sadly there was a cockroach walking across my table. This was after I ate, needless to say shall not return."}
{"text":"Mother's Day May 9th, 2010  Dinner Review:   Joy Bistro is a popular mid-priced restaurant in Leslieville. Known for its fabulous weekend brunch, and flavorful dinners, portions are fair in size, and menu selection exceptional. Owner Steve Pelton is present on most days, and is open to commentary on the meal. My partner had the Muscovy duck medium rare as suggested, and it was excellent. The accompaniments of rapini, sweet potato pancake & elderberry went perfectly with the duck. My Miso Cod was satisfactory. The cod was overdone and possibly frozen prior to cooking. The accompaniments of cabbage, and sundried tomatoes, and potatoes were interesting enough. Dessert - the Creme Brulee was lacking in the right texture and consistency, but was not offensive to the palate. The Bailey's infused chocolate cake was rich in cocoa taste and went well with the home made and experimental Chai ice cream."}
{"text":"I have been here on a off a few times as I live in the neighborhood.   Recently we popped in because lady marmalade had a huge line. I know there had been some management changes and some menu changes as well in the last year.  It was quite busy b"}
{"text":"Stopped by at Joy Bistro early Saturday afternoon for brunch and overall I was disappointed. While there were 3 people working at the restaurant (I'm assuming a host, server and bartender) the service overall was pretty abysmal. Taking our drink orders took a while and it wasn't 30 minutes until we ordered food. We asked the hostess for our server and was told they were trying to change the music in the back room (?) The server seemed pissed off either at our table or something else happening in the restaurant for the remainder of our time there. The bartender did not seem to be helping by taking any tables either.  The food overall was pretty good, with a delicious eggs scramble with a side of chocolate waffles. Again, not sure what was happening with our server that day but we felt anxious asking them for more coffee or another drink. With a lot of better options for brunch along Queen E I won't be going back to Joy Bistro and my friends joining me for brunch have the same sentiment."}
{"text":"Another place serving brunch, but doing it badly.  Why does any restaurant think they can just cook a bunch of eggs and bacon and shove them onto fondue heaters and charge an arm and a leg.    They might have a nice patio and good drinks list, but this review is for their brunch.  We arrive at a decent hour for brunch and the place was about half full, yet the trays were hardly filled up and everything seemed old. Like they cooked everything at 9 am and didn't add anything else.  3 stars because it's a nice place and the staff is friendly, but they need a serious lesson on how to make breakfast."}
{"text":"Passing by this place on the longest \"Lets take a walk with the kids\" walk ever - we popped into Joy Bistro for a bite. The waitress was super friendly, made us some room for the strollers but was also super stressed because it didn't seem like she was prepared today for how busy it was going to be.   I ordered the green apple and cheddar salad while my friend ordered the vegetarian sandwich with side salad. I must admit I was a bit jealous of her sandwich and wanted to kick myself for not getting the pulled pork but my salad was nice and fresh and I pretty much love anything with cheese, grapes and nuts all in one dish! I don't know why they even put lettuce on the plate - MOAR NUTS, GRAPES AND CHEESE!!!!  The price was pretty on par as well for Leslieville for lunch about $10-14 per person. I can't wait to come back and check out the patio and get the pulled pork sandwich - seriously what was I thinking? Salad vs. Pork? PORK WINS!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and was seated while I waited for my friend to join me. I asked about the rotating tap and never heard back. It was a weekday afternoon.  The menu looked alright but lacked in terms of offering anything unique. Finally, it smelled a bit like a \"bar\" in here. Not very appetizing!"}
{"text":"Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you!  I gave Joy Bistro a second, and third chance to redeem themselves. But they feel short. Yet again.  The service was TERRIBLE. We were a table of two, on a Saturday (NOV 10) afternoon at 1:30pm. It was not that busy, but busy enough that the servers were acting like idiots running around. My guest and I waited to long for every point of contact from our server/food runner/and hostess.  We waited at the door for about 3-5 minutes while multiple staff looked at us, and turned around, or walked by. Finally a manager sat us.  Then, we waited about 10 minutes just to place a drink order, with a waitress that we never saw again.  When we finally got to order our meals, they had taken so long that our drinks were empty (alcohol) and they didn't ask if we wanted more. At this point it was a totally different person serving us.   They forgot my side of bacon - TWICE. I was having pancakes for lunch. And although the pancakes were good. The fact that they forgot I had asked for a side of bacon twice, was unforgivable.  It took them another 10-15 minutes to clear out plates. And when we finally got to ask for the bill, we had to wait so long that I actually got up out of my seat and walked to the bar to ask someone for the bill so we could get the hell out of that place.  I will NEVER be going back. EVER again."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've had in my life tied with Clinton Street in NYC.  Tried the poutine eggs benedict, Norwegian eggs benedict and lemon raspberry pancakes and all were delicious.  The service was excellent.  I'm speaking objectively, having eaten brunch all over New York for the past 10 years where brunch is an institution.  I have no clue where the low ratings are coming from?"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch...lots of gluten free options and some well presented twists on standard breakfast fare."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Joy's as we initially had the intention of going to Lady Marmalade which is just a few doors down. Due to the wait there, we decided to try something else. The decor is nice, very new, and there's 2 levels. There was plenty of seating available.  I always go for the traditional breakfast and it was good! Most of my friends got some sort of eggs benny and they enjoyed it. It didn't blow us away. Also, the coffee was a little too strong for my liking and they also serve it with 2% milk or 18% cream which I rarely see and was stunned to see. My one friend actually got the chicken sandwich with fries while everyone ordered breakfast. I must say, the fries were DELICIOUS!  The service was good. It's a nice little spot."}
{"text":"Horrible breakfast, had the quebec which consisted of tons of French fries with 2 poached eggs on top for $14.00. It was just gross, I felt like I was going to vomit after eating it. I won't be back. Been there before and had normal bacon and eggs and it was splendid but now they have resorted to this garbage. I'll stick to the normal breakfast fare elsewhere."}
{"text":"Joy Bistro brought me great happiness during my recent visit, thus their name is quite appropriate.   I dined here during Summerlicious for their special $25 dinner prix fixe menu. Our server Ainsley was incredible friendly and gave us out of towners recommendations for fun things to do in town.  I started my dinner with the fresh berry salad which used local ingredients - strawberries, blueberries, baby spinach, spiced cashews, feta cheese and a orange yogurt dressing. I'm not a big salad girl, but I polished every bite of the greens off.   Soft Rosemary Polenta with Portobello Mushroom & Goat Cheese Fritter as my main was to die for. All my favorite ingredients together in a pleasing vegetarian dish. I would go back to Joy Bistro for this dish alone.  Our waitress said the Flourless Chocolate Torte was a good choice. She was totally right! Rich, thick and yummy in my belly!  We had our meal outside on their tranquil patio and really enjoyed our experience at Joy Bistro.$67 including tax & tip for 3 courses for 2...not bad at all. Let it make you happy, too. =D"}
{"text":"Lovely serving staff. Watermelon and goat cheese salad was tasty but the watermelon was pale and lacking in flavour. Nice location."}
{"text":"Went here two weeks ago with 3 friends for a birthday brunch. I had made reservations and we were seated upstairs. The place has nice ambiance. Food was very good. The buttermilk fried chicken sandwich was probably the best of the bunch. We also had the Leslieville eggs Benedict which was okay... (I've had better) and the Joy scrambler which was alright. Neither of the last two orders were served with toast (that is extra $$$). We also ordered mimosas; white cranberry was better than the strawberry and pineapple (imho). I'm not really into caesers but my friend who ordered one said the Sriracha caeser was good.  All in all, this place has decent food. The price was typical for brunch, we spent about $100 (for four people). Service on the other hand... was pretty horrible.  We were missing a glass. We didn't get water refills, hot sauce or extra pickles when we asked our server (several times). We actually had to ask a different server for a fourth glass and for more water. So I don't know if this is typical customer service but it was a big turn off. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"My visits to Joy Bistro has mainly been for breakfast.    The main selling feature during the summer are the two large patios - one on each side of the restaurant.  This is great for catching some sun while eating.  As a dog owner, it's also nice to be able to have them right nearby rather than leaving them at home.    I usually end up going here because there's ample seating, while the lines over at Lady Marmalade are just much too long for us.  The food is usually pretty good.  I go for the Eggs Benedict.  They've changed the menu up a few times, but there are always a few items that I enjoy.  On the food alone, Joy Bistro is probably 4 stars.  On the other hand, the service here is consistently bad.  The get the basics wrong.  When one of us asks for water, and the waiter says \"ok\", it shouldn't take another 20 minutes for him to bring you water.  I'd be much happier with this place if they could simply keep my water glass full.  When we are finished our meal,there is a very long wait for the bill, even after you ask for it.  They've also frequently gotten one of our orders wrong.  The servers aren't rude, they just seem confused.  They don't seem to be particularly understaffed, either - so I'm not sure what the issue is.  Other than that, Joy is a passable breakfast destination, with a great patio to enjoy."}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is always friendly and the food is great if you are going for lunch, the apple cheddar salad is so refreshing and for dinner the prefix menu is the way to go with the wine pairing- a great value!"}
{"text":"I like to go to Joy in the summer! I love the huge patio/courtyard that reminds me of a European terrace. Last time we visited Joy (this past summer) the server had a really hard time getting one of my dining companion's orders straight. It was a bizarre experience -- he ordered an omelet with no meat and the dish was served to him (TWICE) with beacon. Finally the owner came over to our table, introduced himself and offered to comp this meal. Because we were totally relaxed, and enjoying the summer sun, we weren't too annoyed and were satisfied with the great customer service. I would go back to Joy for sure!"}
{"text":"In Leslieville the land of scrumptious and decadent brunch places with line ups out the vazoo Joy is a great option for tasty brunch without the line.   I have never been there for anything other than the brunch which as been pretty tasty. It's not as fancy as the other places around it in options/decor but that being said you'd be hard pressed to have a simple brunch at Bonjour Brioche or any of the other Leslieville standards. That doesn't mean that the place serves standard food by any means, their  pancakes are seriously outstanding and the french toast rivals most.   Deffo consider it for a weekend option when you don't feel like waiting in a long line up."}
{"text":"the mussels are pretty fantastic! (white wine, sausage, onion)  nice sized portion on the chicken + mushroom quesadilla but a bit too greasy.   friendly staff, and a beautiful patio, great for a leslieville people watchin brunch."}
{"text":"If Joy didn't have a patio, it would be out of business. The food is mediocre, and the service is friendly, but not great. Increasingly, they have plenty of local competition where people are happy to line up for brunch. I hope this pushes them to improve their food, because I do like patios."}
{"text":"Prior to becoming vegan this was my favourite brunch place. Eggs were always exactly the way you ordered, meat was perfectly done (which was a feat since I like my bacon medium-rare), home fries were crispy and soft in all the right places. I give it only 3 stars because if you ordered a side of bacon there were only ever like 3 strips on it, which seemed a little chintzy to me.  Sadly, the only vegan option on the menu other than the fries is an $8 green salad, so I haven't been back in a while.   I have only ever had brunch at Joy but did enjoy it immensely."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch the other day... I really wanted to love this place.  I got an eggs Benny, but the spinach tasted fishy and the peameal bacon also tasted like it was past its prime :(  The dish itself would have been awesome had it been made with fresh ingredients.  Service and coffee were just fine."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while mostly because every time I come here they leave lots to be desired.  Possibly the worst service in the city.  The servers routinely ignore customers, or at least they ignore me about 85% of the time that I'm here.  The only improvement that they've made is bringing a full bottle of water to the table with your glasses so that patrons aren't parched waiting for the servers to bring them water.   It also takes them forever to bring the bill.  I'd like to have some good service at least once.  Just one time.  If they didn't have a patio I would never ever ever ever ever come here again.  The menu has also changed over time.  It's more expensive than it was before.   On to the food...I ordered the goat cheese and braised tomato eggs Benny.  It was a hot mess.  The goat cheese comes in these fried balls beside the eggs Benny which is served on a messy potato rosti.  It actually looked kind of gross how it all fell apart.  It actually started to separate on my plate before I started eating.  I like it when my food comes to the table as if someone else has already chewed it.  Yum.  Also the eggs Benny are always overcooked here.  I'm not sure why I come here.    Right the patio.  That's all."}
{"text":"I'm sad to have to write a two star review for this place because the establishment has two beautiful patios, which I will consider checking out one day, but also a beautiful interior with a menu that screams impressive.  No, there isn't a line up like lady marmalade or bonjour brioche and maybe my experience is the result of many others' experiences but overall...I was let down. We got a table as we checked in. The place was pretty full so it seemed like a done deal for a great meal..haha I rhymed. The waiter came, was courteous and took our orders...everything seemed to be going great. The food came out and the presentation was beautiful. My hubs got the traditional breakfast w. sausage, while I got the spinach mushroom Benedict.  The best part of that meal were probably his potatoes. I was told his sausage was undercooked and the jam for his bread was really a compote syrup...no texture at all.  My eggs were slightly over poached, as I watched the little yolk spill through as I cut into the egg. I was mistaken that instead of a potato Rosti on the side, it actually replaced the English muffin. None the less, it was way overfried, greasy and burnt, leaving it was hard to cut. The thyme hollandaise, which seemed to be a unique component, didn't really match well at all....did not elevate whatsoever.  The most disappointing part was the salad....and,my know I'm pretty much a veg. Junkie. The leaves were largely torn, very sloppy, but that wasn't what bothered me...it was the dressing.....it tasted like a curry scented coat of nauseousness. I don't know how to explain it but it was extremely unappetizing and way too overpowering. Just very awkward altogether.  Our waiter never checked on us, even as I watched him walk beside our table to look out at the scenery from the side patio door. It was not until he gave us the bill that he asked if we wanted a refill of coffee.... But by then, we are ready to Leave, I think that is lazy service.  Sadly, brunch is out for us at this place.... Another meal.... Only if I crave a patio on a hot day....  Ouch. That was harsh wasn't it. The truth hurts, and so did my tummy."}
{"text":"The location is great, but surfers try but the kitchen always disappoints. Just waited Half an hour in the empty restaurant on the Friday evening for a mistake that was overdone x3   I ordered medium rare, no wonder it took so long.  This is the third or fourth time I have been really disappointed here and wasted a nice dining opportunity   Thankfully, I had room on the empty patio to sit as the main dining room smelled like beer and urine.  Whoever owns this place really needs to get back to basics and start paying attention or they will be, like most restaurants, out of business soon enough."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant a lot! The atmosphere was nice,  not too busy for a Saturday night but a good space. Service was 5 stars. My girlfriend had the steak and it was easily one of the best steaks I've tasted in Toronto!! The homemade ketchup went great with the fries. Calamari as a side was perfect and the pulled pork sandwich was succulent and full of taste. I would highly recommend this place. Only issue was that I would have liked more of a selection on the menu,  but otherwise very impressed"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a table while there were tables open right in front of us.  Servers and the hostess passed by several times without acknowledging. Hostess sat another table who arrived after we did with no explanation. Typically a good spot but I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The simplicity of the menu is absolutely mouthwatering. This little bistro has a double outdoor patio one on the street and the other a little tucked away in the back. Great service. A real treat when visiting riverside. A must"}
{"text":"Great space, patio is large and beside a park, so it gives you a Brooklyn NY vibe, the menu has a great selection, and the food is always quality. Price is decent and co petite with other nearby places.  The brunch is one one of my favourites, busy, but not insane."}
{"text":"i've been here several times. the food is great, the staff are very polite and trying hard and the venue is really nice. i like coming here, especially when the patio is open. i have a small child and the staff are very accommodating. it can get pretty busy on the weekends, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"What a perfect day for brunch and a walk in Leslieville. Our experience today was so pleasant. Joy is right across from a nice park and in a great neighbourhood. Their outdoor patio runs North off Queen, so you're not right on the main street.   Great customer service, and also very accommodating to my non dairy/non gluten issues.  I had a very yummy Smoked Salmon and Egg brunch.  I would have loved to stay for a Cappuccino, but alas, they do not have Soy. When I mentioned it to our server, he said that he has tried to encourage the management to get some, which was really nice to hear.   Good food, good atmosphere... go here and enJOY ;-)"}
{"text":"If you love eggs benedict, then pleeeeeease for your taste buds' sakes try joy bistro!!  Positives: -the food is fantastic -optimal patio space (they have two separate patios) - one facing Jimmie Simpson (a park), one with a bit more privacy -there's an upstairs they use mostly for private events, I believe  -did I mention you should try the eggs benedict? -due to larger seating area, much shorter (if any) line than other comparable restaurants in the area (eg lady marmalade and bonjour brioche) -cheap drinks (under $5 before 7pm)  Negatives: -when it's busy, food may take a while. Twice I've had to wait 30+ minutes. But at least when it's arrived it's delicious! And if you're in good company then you might not mind so much (:"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch today with a large group and it was great! Very kid friendly, there's even a kids brunch option for $5. We were seated upstairs and it was roomy and had lots of light. I had the special brunch sandwich with gluten free bread - yum! I would've posted a photo but I ate it to fast. I also booked a reso through the yelp app and it went through so easily. I thought it was too easy so I called to verify and it all went through no problem. Great experience despite the mini-snow storm we fought coming down there. I would definitely go back. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"What is says on the bottle: 'joy' Great little place, warm welcome, outdoor and in seating, great cocktails and v good meal I cant fault you Ms Joy."}
{"text":"A great alternative for breakfast if you do not want to brave the long lineup at Lady Marmelade. There is ample seating and 2 large patios that flank the restaurant. Still, it made me wonder why more people didn't migrate 2 doors down to get a seat right away, and I learned why:  1. The food is mediorcre and in a neighborhood surrounded by high quality cuisine & ingredients, this place fell short of delivering a fresh brunch. I ordered the Eggs benedict and they weren't BAD but the dish also was not memorable enough to entice me to come back here again.  2. Aligned with all the other reviews about service. It was painfully slow and our server was very forgetful when it came to extras that we ordered. Our coffee cups were also always longing for a warm refill but she never noticed.  Overall, Joy Bistro is worth a try if you are not in the mood to brave the lines and want a quiet place to catch up with friends over a-ok food."}
{"text":"Food was underwhelming! My red lentil (vegetarian) burger fell apart after first bite and had me burping cumin for days. We also order the appetizer platter which was disappointing and bland (hummus, cold eggplant, etc). My friend ordered a beef burger and she took 4 bites and gave up on it. I am never going for food there again (even though I've heard it's had a few management change overs). The service and ambience were nothing special. I was embarrassed to have taken my friend there....I should have done my homework first on Yelp."}
{"text":"Since moving to Corktown, my fianc√© and I have been eating along while we explore the gems in the neighbourhood. So we have decided to stop by Joy Bistro for Summerlicious last night - $25 for 3 courses :D (still going on until July 20, 2014).  Two beautiful patios to choose from. More dining space upstairs and can accommodate special functions - there was a wedding going on last night too ;) Joy Bistro also had a nice drink menu. The cider and fruit beers got me excited - the grapefruit beer tasted great lol.  We both ordered Wild Boar Terrine to start. Never knew what wild boar taste like, and to my surprise, it actually tasted like tuna LMAO! I enjoyed the sweet chutney and the pickled mushrooms, which complimented well with the meat.  The mains fell a bit short. I was so excited to see Goat Shoulders on the menu. But the goat was under seasoned and slightly overcooked. Thank goodness the mini potatoes and the green beans helped to give more flavour the dish. We also ordered PEI mussels as our second main. Very tasty tomato broth paired with a couple thick-cut toasted bread; however, not all of the mussels were cooked thoroughly... bottom ones remained closed :(  The highlight of the night would probably be the dessert :) Instead of choosing one out of the three, we got all three :D How sweet of them! We had a slice of the flourless chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream in a cone, and a lemon mousse.  Overall, it was still an enjoyable meal. Service was attentive. Love the patio :) I would definitely come back for drinks with my girls!"}
{"text":"It was my second time in Joy's Bistro, and unfortunately exactly the same problem -staff. They have a patio so place gets full when it's warm and lots of people come in. When we sat down the place was half empty though. We were completely ignored by staff, we waited about 15 minutes and eventually asked for the menu even though one of the waitresses saw us twice and didnt even bother asking if we were ok. We ordered coffee and fries (after waiting for another 15 minutes for someone to take our order). For fries first and 10 minutes later coffee, seriously??? On top of that: no cutlery, no ketchup, not even a spoon to stir the sugar.  Staff is awful, there seem to be so many of them but they completely lack any customer service.  When I was there for the first time exactly the same thing happened. I will not go there again, too bad because its a nice diner."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here for breakfast.  But I have enjoyed breakfast here many times.  The best best BEST thing about breakfast here - there is never a line, even on weekends.  I LOVE breakfast but I will not stand in line for it (Bonjour Brioche's lines out onto the street on weekends boggle my tiny mind).    I have enjoyed bacon and eggs both downstairs and upstairs, and they have 2 patios that are open now that it's summer.  It is a little bit fancy for my brunch tastes, but the staff never makes me feel like I am under dressed or not welcome.  The food, in order of greatness/my excitement about it: 1. FRESH GRAPEFRUIT JUICE 2. solid crispy bacon 3. decent hashbrowns - they fall on the upper side of good  I have had brunch here with people who have ordered pancakes and enjoyed them, and a vegetarian who had the veggie wrap and was kind of lukewarm about it.  But seriously, if you are a vegetarian and you come with me for brunch, you should either order waffles, or not complain.  I will definitely go here again, but probably still only for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"On many trips out to The Beaches, i have always wanted to stop into Joy Bistro.  On the weekend we were in the leslieville neighborhood during their 5-7 PM happy hour.  Great prices for Local Mill St Organic, it was only $3.50 a pint, which i swear would cost you more at the LCBO.  The beer bargain was pretty much the peak of our meal.  We had the spaghetti Carbonara with pancetta for $19.  It was made with fettuccine noodles and it resembled more of an alfredo than a carbonara.  The pancetta was my fav part of the dish, it also needed more seasoning, however there were no salt or pepper vessels at our table.  My sis had the tagliatelle with lamb, again the pasta was fettuccine, the noodles should have been more broad for it to be a true tagliatelle.  For the meat it was tender but lacked a great sauce to bind the dish together.  Overall i probably wouldnt go back because the food just wasnt there.  The actual pasta noodles served in each dish were incorrect  and i was just eating my food to finish it instead of enjoying it.  There are way too many superior restaurants in Toronto to settle."}
{"text":"I am too often forced to make the tough decision between spinach and smoked salmon as a substitute for ham on my eggs benedict and have always thought that asking for both would seem a bit greedy...until today. It felt just right when I ordered Joy Bistro's \"Eggs Norwentine\" ($13) which was not only served with both and topped with plenty of creamy hollandaise, but also a side of delicious fried-but-still-rather-potatoey homefries.   The cheesy eggs were found to not be cheesy enough, but it wasn't anything good old ketchup couldn't salvage. The big ol' regular breakfast was a hit too. Sides of sauteed tomatoes for $2 were worth every penny.  The service was notably good. We noticed since we sauntered in from the rain starving, but were served promptly and even asked how the food was. I will definitely be back on a drier day to spend time on the ornately furnished patio!"}
{"text":"We originally wanted to go to another brunch place in the neighbourhood, but we ended up here to avoid the long line. The place is cozy with classy decor. The waiters were friendly and were able to move around the tables to accommodate our group.  I am very happy to see Kids menu available with a very reasonable price.  We started with cappuccino, fresh juice, and homemade hot chocolate. They were all delicious.   I tried the popular Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict; the aroma of the fresh herbs told me the food gonna be good! And my prediction was right! the eggs were cooked right and the scone was warm and fluffy. The smoked salmon went so well with the pickled onion.  My friends enjoyed their Free Run Egg Omelette dishes. One friend paid extra for the smoked salmon and the portion was generous.   Kids meal came with a small glass of fresh juice, plate of a small chocolate waffle, one scrambled egg, fruits and home fries. The portion may be good for a small child, but I have no complaint for the price we paid and the quality of food.  The meal was perfect except my child found a piece of butter wrapper in the waffle. We reported the issue and the waiter replaced it with a new one.   We really enjoyed the meals for two reasons -1) the fresh ingredients they used. The homemade ketchup was so good! 2) waiters are friendly and service was attentive. 3) The ambiance was nice. Seatings are comfortable; there is a patio facing a park. I think it will be very nice in summer.  We will definitely come back for another brunch."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch. The food was good but the service was so awful!   We were ignored for 20mins I eventually had to go and ask the hostess to send a server to our table.  Still she didn't arrive for another 10mins!   Coffee was weak and water wasn't topped up. There were obviously not enough staff working and the server was visibly stressed.   As I said food was ok but due to service I wouldn't go back :-("}
{"text":"Four stars for the venue. It is very pleasant sitting on the patio. Another four stars for the service. Although it took quite a while to get our food, our server was pleasant and attentive. The food I would give around three and a half stars. I wanted the handmade turkey club hot dog because the description intrigued me, but they didn't have it (grrrrr) so I went with the roasted chicken sandwich. It wasn't nearly as exciting as I imagine my first choice would have been, but it was decent. The fries were well cooked and flavourful. The sandwich bread also had a nice texture, but the chicken was a bit bland. My friend had the eggs Benedict and she said they looked better than they tasted. I was happy to learn that a Thornbury cider pint on tap was only $6.50.  All in all, I wasn't wowed, but it was alright."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today- excellent service, excellent food! Really enjoyed the patio.  Had the Leslieville Benny- two eggs with pemeal, spinach and tomatoes on a potato cake- actually pretty light and really delicious.   Will definitely be back to try their extensive beer menu and enjoy the patio in the evening!!"}
{"text":"I think is a solid place for brunch or grabbing a drink I've had anew years meal here once I wasn't impressed with but the brunch is always pretty, well presented, nice service etc. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Had a nice snack here on one of the patios. Brilliant. Best fries I've ever had with a lovely textured and exciting house made ketchup. In addition, had the Korean Fried Chicken, also great."}
{"text":"Dinner at Joy Bistro was a frustrating affair. Our reservation was confused. We were first offered a seat at the least desirable table in the restaurant, right in front of the door (and I would suggest this table be eliminated, as if I were seated there it would be a certainty I would never return). Refusing it, we were seated at the elevated tables (bar style) on the wall opposite the bar. The restaurant is fairly small, so these tables increase the seating space, but I personally do not enjoy eating a bar-style seats.  Once we were seated we were promptly ignored for the better part of 20 minutes. Someone finally came to take our dinner orders, but I think he was the bartender. He could not answer any questions about the menu items. We hadn't even been asked if we wanted to order drinks. We had brought a bottle of wine to be uncorked at the restaurant. It took another 10 or 15 minutes for that task to be accomplished. Then our service disappeared again. Finally we asked the waiter from the next table to call over our server. She said she would just take our orders and became our defacto waiter for the remainder of the evening. She was pleasant and minimally attentive after that.  I had the Rainbow Beet Salad with arugula and buffalo mozza. I enjoyed it. tangy pickled beets, light, creamy dill dressing (not overpowering), and the mozza was pretty good. One of my dinner companions did not like it. Too much vinegar in the beets was her complaint. Main was Lamb Shank with what was described as an apple-fennel chutney, but it was just sauted fennel and some raisins, from what I could tell. Accompanied by mashes sweet potato and rappini. The meat had a natural strong lamb flavour. It did not turn out to be to my taste, but no fault of the chef. The fennel whatever was fairly flavourless. The sauce was uninspired. The sweet potato mash and rappini were fine.  Companions had the flank steak. I tried a piece. It was covered in a pesto that added much needed flavour. The steak needed some seasoning. The chicken carbonara was, supposedly, very good.  Overall, meh. The service was less than desirable. The food was plain. Not bad, but not great. I will not return to Joy Bistro unless I must. There are just too many restaurants in this city to waster my time there again."}
{"text":"I met my friend here for brunch yesterday, and while the room and service were warm, I can't say the same thing for my entree.  I ordered the scramble, my friend the omlette and split a kale Caesar as an app. All three dishes arrived at once, and my eggs were tepid and devoid of seasoning. The beans were okay and the serving of bacon was paltry - less than two full pieces. I didn't complain as I ate it all (I was starving!) but it was a disappointment nonetheless.   The kale Caesar wasn't particularly caesar-like (olives as a garnish?) but the pork belly was a nice touch.  Despite the kind service I probably won't go back: The food wasn't good enough to merit a second visit."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot in the City. The food was really good and had a  unique flare. However, the server needed to be much more personable. By the end of our meal our babbling baby forced her to crack a smile.   Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday morning, around 10:30am. It was fairly busy but we were taken upstairs to the additional seating area which was really cozy - could've been someone's dining room. I had the Leslieville Eggs Benny and it was ok - not a fan of tomatoes and potato rosti with my poached eggs. It was definitely a different take on eggs benny...not my favourite. But, I must say that the service was great despite what most other reviewers have said - perhaps it was due to it being earlier and less busy. I might be back to try something else in the future."}
{"text":"Supremely yummy brunch options! I love Joy (and its sister restaurant, Over Joy - which is the upstairs portion) because it's off the beaten path and never overly crowded or hard to get a table. If you go, make sure you order Joy's Cheesy Eggs (scrambled eggs with multiple types of cheese melted throughout) or the Dutch Oven Pancake, which is a 1.5\" thick pancake that's nearly impossible to finish - it's that big!!"}
{"text":"I REALLY want to like this place for brunch but how many chances do you get.   After a couple times having brunch:  Food is bland bordering on just plain bad.  Service is very inconsistent (example: friendly but ignored for most of the meal then asked repeatedly if we needed anything)    Really only thing going for it is space (upstairs) so is usually not a (long) wait for a table, unlike the (delicious but always totally lined up) Lady Marmalade a few doors down.  And it's location.  Probably based on that alone it will always be packed.    It's just a shame the food is so tepid.  I was hopeful after the recent remodelling that they would also spend some money improving the menu / food, but it was purely an aesthetic change."}
{"text":"Last weekend, my husband and I hosted a 40th Anniversary for my parents at Overjoy.  Overjoy is the room upstairs that is used for private events and regular dining when events are not upstairs.  After reading some less than favourable reviews, I decided to try it out for myself, as I find Yelp reviews can often be overly critical.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised!    The manager was extremely helpful, professional, and warm.  She made me feel confident from the minute I met her.  The communication was very professional and she was open to all of the suggestions I made.  The food was fantastic!  Our guests gave lots of positive feedback on the menu.  The Leslieville Eggs Benny was a hit!  Their hollaindaise sauce is awesome and I love how they put their bennies on a potatoe rosti.  The dessert was delicious.  The coffee and tea was very high quality.  They offered a lot of fantastic mocktails and hor d'oeuvres as well.  The atmosphere is awesome!  They have beautiful chandeliers, great artwork, and they always have fresh flowers.   The service was great.  They have done an amazing job making sure they have good staff.  My father said, \"You can always tell there is good service when everything you want is there for you and you didn't notice how it got there.\"  The staff was so lovely and attentive.    My husband and I have also been here for brunch and dinner several times.  It's not just events they do well!  We highly recommend Joy Bistro.  They have done an amazing job remaking this restaurant into an amazing local dining hub."}
