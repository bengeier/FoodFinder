{"text":"What a disappointment on the food and service. The building looked nice on the outside and cool walls. 
The tamales where dried out with a nasty red sauce and cheese on top.  Americanised.. 
The burrito and enchilada where both tasteless with only hamburger in middle. 
The kids hamburger was hard and the bun was stale with weird tasting cheese. I caused a belly ache. 
The cheese dip was okay and likely from a Sysco foods can 
They wouldn't honor the beer drink special posted on the days special board. 
Avoid this place is my recommendation."}
{"text":"Visited there yesterday for the first time.  Food was awful.  I had the special which was a steak and cheese enchilada.  What I was served was a dried out grissly piece of faux steak and on top of that were two enchiladas with chunks of unmelted cheese inside.  I should have sent it back.  Skip this place"}
{"text":"The food used to be great here, it was my No. 2 spot. Dont know what happened."}
{"text":"We live closeby and while we'd love to love this place, we just don't.  Every time we've gone, we've asked for a special way to order something, for example, no mushrooms on the veggie fajita.  Do you think they can get this right?  Nope.  Every time, mushrooms show up.  DH orders mole with his order sometimes.  Do you think they bring a cup of mole?  Nope.  We have to repeat our special requests every time.  We got tired of doing that, so we just stopped going.  The taco truck down the street across from Betty Jane school is much, much better."}
{"text":"Tacos!  Enchiladas!  Margaritas!  Sign me up!

This place was pretty righteous.  The food was spot-on delicious and it wasn't too expensive.  My only complaint would be the dinner combinations - all of them are served with beef, no substitutions.  I recommend ordering a few of your Mexican favorites a la carte... it may actually even be just as cost effective.

The margaritas were awesome.  Seriously.  One 28oz margarita and I was feeling a bit tipsy.  At $7, I'm a cheap date!

On another note, if your friend has a birthday, this is definitely a place to bring them if you wanna see them blush.  The entire restaurant parades out of the back singing loudly and carrying a sombrero.  Just don't let the birthday boy or girl duck and cover.

Since Mexican restaurants aren't a dime-a-dozen in Akron like they are in Chicago, it was nice to find a place to grab some when I come home."}
{"text":"We have been here 20+ times. Been very happy every time. One of my favorite mexican joints in the Akron area. Food is hot, fast, and delicious."}
{"text":"They have several traditional meals that are not beef like pork carnitas, chicken yolandas and camarones (shrimp) diablo.  You'll definately find something you like.  Great place with fast, friendly service."}
