{"text":"Excellent wings - but service is poor and so slow that we will not be coming back on wing nights (Monday).  May try another night as you don't really save that much during the wing special anyway!"}
{"text":"Some of the best bar & grill food I've ever had. Had some hot Parmesan garlic wings and they were perfect - good size, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and just the right amount of sauce. Also had the Reuben and some cheese and bacon fries. Everything was done very well....even the cole slaw. Will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game or catch a good band. It's been my go to since I moved to the north hills. Order some food and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service at noon, weekday, was prompt and pleasant.
Had the blackened grilled chicken sandwich with fries and chili. Loved it all.
As Arnie says, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service was very slow, the menu had a nice selection, I had the delmonico, if I ever came back ( which I dont plan to) I would order something else.The parking situation is HORRIBLE!!!!! Also we had to pay $5 cover each beacause there was a band. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy going to Rochester Inn whether it be for a casual meal, drinks and music, or to watch a sporting event.  The waitstaff is incredibly friendly and attentive even on very busy nights which is often the case.  If you're looking for a fun place to relax and enjoy a good home cooked meal, Rochester is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Sat down at 6:30, ordered at 6:40 and didn't get food until 7:40. All we ordered were sandwiches, food came to us cold. Servers didn't have the first on being a server, won't go back and wouldn't recommend anyone going here unless you have a lot of time in your hands and the need to eat crap food."}
{"text":"If you are going for drinks and bar food to watch a game this is a decent spot. Typically good bar crown, although last time I was there a crew of sloppy drunk loud obnoxious 21 year old guys were there watching the games. Swearing loudly, causing a scene, and the bartender did nothing about it and continued to serve them. I was once this 21 year old so I don't hold it against them too much but it was a horrible experience for everybody else at the bar.
As far as going to the restaurant I'd avoid it at all costs. The food sucks. I got fajitas which came with a side of Montezuma revenge. My wife's sandwich was sloppy and greasy. Nothing I'd ever return for."}
{"text":"Let me start with this, their fries are amazing!  They were really crispy, hot and not stale!  I usually don't care too much for fries, but their's were the bomb.  This joint has a ton of seating and it was pretty quiet considering how many people were there.  I ate with a decently large group of people and we were seated quickly and everyone realliked liked their food.  They have a really nice drink selection too.  I would go here again."}
{"text":"Their bar area is a great place to eat and watch sports.  They have a slew of flat screens all with different games on, and one giant projector screen always showing the home team.  If you aren't into the sports bar vibe, they have a nice dining room area as well, separate from the bar.  Food exceeded my expectations.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"loud\" restaurants. Very loud. Not a place for conversation without having to yell at each other. Food is OK."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon right around 5 pm to grab an earlier dinner. I read the reviews so wasn't expecting much. I have to say that the food was better than I had expect and the service was as good as I could have wanted. I would guess that for the dining room there was only one server and she quickly got busy because the place was packed by the time we left around 6:00pm. Our service didn't suffer but others may have as we already had our food. I had a Reuben which was a pretty good Reuben and was satisfied. The portion size was a little on the large side and I almost me and my lady would have shared fried as opposed to ordering an order each. I would go back and think that this place does a nice job for bar/lunch fare."}
{"text":"Party of 18 and we placed orders for beer, appetizers etc.  food took 1 hour and 20 minutes to get there and it came 4 dinners at a time.  Just really bad service and the food was below average.  Gosh, I wish i had better to say because it is a family ownership restaurant.  Not with a clear conscience can I give even 2 stars.  Bad, pretty darn bad."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to get here for some time based on some personal recommendations from our friends. We stopped by on a Friday night and were taken aback on how full the parking lot was (a good sign to start). The restaurant and bar area were pretty full, and we decided on the bar area since there wasn't a wait. We later regretted this decision as it was incredibly loud and we were chased out by the band that was setting up and clustering the area around us with equipment.

I'm going to chalk up our visit as \"I probably didn't order what I should have.\" We went with the hot cheese balls as an appetizer, which were frankly, pretty awful. Lesson learned: always go with the mozzarella sticks.

I had a side salad with balsamic which was the best part of my overall meal as the vegetables which delicious (especially the tomatoes). But now, this is where it took a turn... not only was a band filtering in and making a racket and pressuring us to leave, our food just took forever to show up. To the point where I really wasn't hungry. As such, my wings ended up not being appetizing which was probably a mix of being full and not liking the flavor. I went with hot garlic parm and while the wings were big, they were incredibly soggy and disappointing.

We'll be back to give them another try... and hopefully they do better."}
{"text":"The Rochester is good for a quick bite. The atmosphere is great however sometimes service is slow because there is not enough servers to get around"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times (many of which have been for Wings) and the food and service has been excellent.  

I will say though if you want to have a great Wing Night, go here on Monday nights. Excellent selection and the Buffalo Ranch are the best around. 

As for taking a big party (say 18 people) you can probably know it's not going to be fast service, because that's just a crazy amount of people to service in one party anyway. Don't base your experience with service on one time with being here in a large group."}
{"text":"I was part of a large group of old guys. My first visit. I am a microbrewery fan. They had better than average choices on tap. Food was very good. Better than typical bar choices. Very good menu choices. Diverse. Service was excellent. 
My fajitas were excellent. Grilled chicken. Side of fries also good. Extra crispy!  
   Not the best spot I've been, but quite good. Food was solid, I recommend for a nice micro brew and something grilled."}
{"text":"We went into this restaurant at 6:45 last evening (Wednesday).  A party of three and you seat yourself.  There were two empty booths and two longer tables (seat 6). We sat down and in a couple of minutes a waitress with multi-colored hair informed us if we wanted dinner (it is a restaurant right?)???? then we would have to wait at least 50 minutes for any food from the kitchen! She made it clear she didn't want our business; she said the kitchen was backed up because they expanded their patio section and the kitchen can't keep up? We understood but she offered to not take a drink; I guess assuming we were going to leave.  We waited a few minutes and when it was clear NOBODY was going to wait on us we walked out. We have visited MULTIPLE times before and have NEVER been treated in such a manner! I realize it is also a bar but as my teen son said - when he looked around ALL but ONE table already had their food???  My suggestion is to go to Sir Pizza around the corner or to Sunny Jim's on Camp Horne - we went to Sunny Jim's and they were VERY glad to wait on us and take our $$$$.  Shame on Hardwood Grille for treating customers in such a manner. Customers are what makes a business work but they clearly didn't want any last night!"}
{"text":"Love their food and drinks. Fun place to watch sports games and they have live bands pretty often. It stinks when there is a cover charge though. The crowd there is a bit older usually, maybe around their 50s and 60s? Nice place though!"}
{"text":"We'll come back again for sure! Wings were good - fried crispy. Salads were huge and dressings were delicious - ranch & blue cheese tasted homemade! Steak was ok. Pass on the cheese fries - the cheese sauce is terrible! Good old bar food for sure with a ton of beer on tap. Busy but friendly atmosphere. Dining section is family friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, good value.  Never a bad experience when we go.  Try the chicken wings."}
{"text":"I ordered take out today: philly chicken wrap minus peppers, and fries. Although they were busy, my food was ready in 10 minutes. It was delicious! The chicken was moist and the fries have a nice, crisp texture. Coleslaw came with the platter. It was ok. For only $10, you get a ton of food. I have enough for lunch tomorrow. Can't wait to try some other things next time."}
{"text":"Our group had lunch reservation for 22 people but turned into 29. We were seated in back room. Everyone got there at 11:30 and only got our food at 1:20. There was only one waitress for 29 people. There was no way one waitress could do an excellent job with that many people. The food didn't take very long to come once we all ordered but for us to sit there for so long before waitress took our orders, was unacceptable. People getting antsy. I have been there many times before this so I went to bar to get free popcorn and others followed. Granted, seven additional people came when reservation was 22 but even at 22 people, another waitress should have been added especially to take all the orders. We were the party in the back room so why didn't the waitress start taking our orders much, much sooner than she did for us to eat so late. Because of this, a few had to leave before they could even order. They never expected to be at lunch so long."}
{"text":"Been there 3 or 4 times the last couple years. Service is REALLY SLOW!! I have no plans to return!"}
{"text":"The waitresses took forever to get to us. Waited for our food over a half hour. The waitress never came to check on us. And my food wasn't good. Never coming back. Too loud and the tables are so small"}
{"text":"Typical sports bar lots of TVs lots of noise. They do have two dining areas yes they also have TVs. Food is OK reasonably priced. Service is always been good I go back occasionally"}
{"text":"We had dinner there this evening for my birthday.  Both the food and service were excellent.  I had the fish platter and my wife had a cheeseburger.  All of our friends also enjoyed their meals. There was also a live band in the bar.  A neighborhood treasure, IMHO."}
{"text":"Please PLEASE disregard the other review.  Clearly, things have gotten better at Rochester Inn.  This restaurant is quite close to us and we've gone often over the past year.  The service is always good, the food is really really good, and our check at the end of the meal is always surprisingly lower than we expected.  Hands down, this place has the best steak salads in the the 'burgh (possibly my favorite EVER).  We've tried the burgers, and they've all been great.  The RIbeye was really good.  The wings also are good.  There's a nice big deck out back, and it seems to do good business in the evenings as a sports bar type place.  They frequently advertise live bands, though we haven't been out to check these out yet.  Overall, one of my favorite local spots - it's always the first place we take our out-of-town friends when they drop by."}
{"text":"We stopped here to watch live music and have a few drinks. It is one of the few places I can find blockhouse on tap! I can't attest to the food because we didn't eat BUT I can't speak about the environment. This place had such an awesome and high-energy older crowd!  As soon as the music started everyone was up  dancing and having a great time. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My parents have been here on a couple different occasions and have always talked about how good the food is, however last week I met with them for dinner on a Thursday evening and I can't say I will ever want to come back.

It was completely packed, but my mom was able to get a table in the middle of the dining room and my dad and I arrived shortly after.  A waitress came to take our drink orders and we asked if it was OK if we waited for my dad to arrive. Our drinks arrived and shortly after, so did my dad.  

It wasn't for another 15 minutes that we saw our waitress again to order my dads drink and all of our food.  I ordered the salmon & broccoli with Caesar salad, my mom got the reuben and my dad had BBQ wings and a cup of chili.  The food took about 20 minutes to come out, which was understandable, because it was so busy.

When it was brought out to our table, everything looked good, however it did not taste the way it looked.  My broccoli was cold and had no seasoning or salt on it.  The salmon was insanely dry and flavorless - hardly edible even doused in one of the three sauces it came with and the Caesar salad was good, but the dressing had WAY too much lemon in it - very sour. My mom said her reuben was just OK. the bread was not buttered and there was hardly dressing on it.  Dad's wings, which I tried, were basic  - tough and didn't seem that great of quality. He said his chili was overly packed with beans.

We did not see our waitress again until she brought out or checks.  Poor service and terrible food during our visit - I even commented to my mom after we left that it was probably the worst meal and experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  I can't believe this place was so packed...but maybe it's a different story when youre just coming for the bar.

The interior is nothing special - certainly not fancy.  The tables are strange wooden tables that you'd find at your grandmothers house and the bar area is enormous.  Very casual.  Our table was sticky and the floors weren't very clean - just very bizarre."}
{"text":"Stopped in for music and a few drinks.  Service was not great even through they weren't busy.   No big deal  - until we left after settling the tab and leaving an appropriate tip.. A bartender \"accosted\" us in the Lyft car .... he threw the tip at one of the passengers and said \"don't  come back\" and slammed the door.  The driver was shocked that her car was treated that way.  WTF?  They got the tip they deserved and didn't like it. Upon calling the management  we were  informed that\" they valued their staff and they had cameras in the parking lot\", great. Hmm perhaps they should value their staff by paying them instead of expecting we, the public, to do so.  Maybe I missed something... isn't a tip voluntary based on service?   When did it become expected in order to supplement low wages paid by employers?"}
{"text":"Kevin was our server on April 7 when Tony Janflone was on. Kevin had a large MeetUp group and was efficient and pleasant with everyone and patient with my order changes. Kudos Kevin!"}
{"text":"I ate here this past Tuesday evening with my father.  We came here at around 4:15 for an early dinner as my dad had to make it out to his bowling league later in the evening.  The setup of the place is that they have different entrances for both the bar and the dining room even though they seem to link up in the middle.  I do like the idea though as it makes it easier for the servers to notice you.  In the restaurant side there were a bunch of tables and booths and TV's that could be seen by each and every seat.  Whenever we walked into the restaurant side of the building there were only about 3 other tables eating. 

Since we were eating early I decided to go a bit lighter and get the Chicken Caesar salad while my dad ordered the Fried Fish dinner.  My salad came out and I can't say that it was anything special, nor that it was bad.  It had your normal grilled chicken breast on top of romaine lettuce with cheese and Caesar dressing and was an average portion size.  None of the flavors stood out which helped to make it sort of a blah meal for myself.  My dad did enjoy his fried fish with vegetables and fries and he finished all of it although he also thought that it was nothing special.

The bottom line for me is that I probably will not be heading back here in the future.  While there is nothing wrong with the place, the food is just average and I feel like I can get much better food for a better price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just went again on Friday. Wings still super solid, good live music, great beer list. I tried the Ruben this time. Money. I was there for a couple hours and I think my bill was only like $40."}
{"text":"Headed here to watch the Pens playoff game, great selection of beer. Service was slammed with a full bar, so waited 30 minutes to be serviced. Luckily, free popcorn kept us full and occupied. We ordered the bar pizza skip this, tasted like frozen from the freezer section of the grocery store. The wood fired pizza was great and only cost $2.00 more. A great place to watch a game as they are big screens everywhere. A great local hang out!"}
{"text":"I have not had a meal at this place I have only visited the bar twice On my first visit to be safe I ordered Heineken beer in the bottle the taste was authentic as it should be since there is no way to  open the bottle and water down the drink. Today I stopped by and ordered a Coors light draft it was as it should be, so I decided to order a shot of Tequila. Reposado was my preference. There were two bar maids on duty not sure of their names one was tall the other was short. The tall one asked the short one if they had any Reposado she said no they had 1800. She did not know that 1800 is the year tequila was first aged in oak cask and Reposado is one of the varieties of Tequila e.g. 1800 Silver (Blanco), 1800 Reserva Añejo, and of course 1800 Reserva Reposado that has a golden hue and the taste is a good balance between the Agave and wood flavors.  The drink that I received did not have a golden hue at all it was almost clear and you could not taste any Agave. The drink literally had no kick at all. I mentioned this to the bar maid's the short one became very defensive almost to point of being angry she insisted they did not water down drinks. I told her that I have been drinking for many years and I know what I am drinking I tried to explain that if Rochester Inn did not water it down it was done at the distribution center. I used to have a friend who was a liquor salesman and I know from first hand information this is a common practice it's what's called bar liquor The tall one offered to give me the drink for free which was nice of her but I insisted on paying full price for it and told her I just would not order it any more.  My whole point is I been all over the USA and some other places as well and I have always drank top shelf.  I have a seasoned pallet not only for alcohol but food as well and that drink did not cut it. To bad I just wanted a decent drink and was willing to pay whatever it cost but I wanted what I was paying for. It might not be a bad idea if the Inn invested in mixology school for their bartenders not every customer wants to drink beer or maybe that why they do because they know the drink will not be what it is suppose to be"}
{"text":"This is our favorite local spot.  It's near the house, and the best place to watch a game nearby.  Lots of TVs in the bar area - almost impossible to have a bad viewing seat.  Also, they have good live music on Friday and Saturday nights.

The wings here are great, and they have good Lenten specials.  My personal favorite is anything from the wrap menu.  Service is good, assuming you can get a table!  Tends to get packed during games or on weekends.

Don't forget the free popcorn in the bar :)"}
{"text":"Great burger and fries.  They use freshly ground beef and it certainly makes a difference.  I brought half of my burger home and it still had a great taste even though it was no longer warm.   The menu is pretty extensive and they have regular daily features.                                                     
The dining area is close to the open kitchen  and there is  a  very large separate bar room with giant TV screens throughout.  It appears it might become  very loud inside the bar once it is fully packed.
The Rochester Inn is definitely on my must return list.  However, I will use caution when deciding on dessert as my slice of  carrot cake was clearly enough for  3 people and ended up costing more than my burger."}
{"text":"Can we do minus stars? She didn't hear the order, brought the wrong item, had the attitude. When the right sandwich came out, what a disappointment. First and last time here. Save yourself go someplace, anyplace else. Looks nice on the outside nothing on the inside."}
{"text":"Love the place but the  loud music has driven me away the last two visits.

I will give a shot tonight because music doesn't start until 9:30."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, on my own.  Parking lot size is very good; I've never had trouble finding a space even when the place is crowded.  The bar and dining areas are separate, nice for folks who don't really want to be in a bar.  The restaurant area is rather small, however, maybe 10 to 12 tables, and it usually seems to be pretty well filled up, although I've always been able to get a booth.  And only because I've always found a booth, I've never sat in the bar area, only went in to look around.  It's a BIG bar area with a nice open feel to it and lots of seating, both at the bar itself and at tables placed all around.  It has a very friendly feel to it, and I'm guessing it gets pretty full during sporting events {GO PENS!}, wing nights and such.  The food...The first time I came here I was jonesing for a good burger, and boy, did I get one!!  Good to the point that it's what I've ordered every time since!  I actually ordered the platter, which comes with fries and housemade coleslaw and is of course, and rightly so, a few dollars more.  Now, the burgers listed weren't completely what I wanted, so I customized just a bit , going with a bacon cheeseburger {bacon VERY crisp} and lots of grilled onions.  My order was a little slow in arriving, but clearly it was because the place was busy on both sides.  And, believe me, each time I've been there, those servers MOVE!  Anyway, when the food arrived, the burger and fries were hot, the slaw nice and cold.  And everything was wonderful!  The burger was cooked exactly the way I'd ordered it {medium-well} and was nice and juicy.  The bacon was indeed beautifully crisp.  There was lots of melty, melty cheese, and the onions were grilled to perfection.  The fries were...not seasoned, exactly, but with something that made them perfectly crisp. And the slaw, which actually looks to be tiny chunks rather than shreds, was creamy and tangy.  My bill, which also included a Diet Coke, came to $10.06, which I feel is phenomenal for the taste, quality, and size {I had to take more than half the burger and half the slaw home!} of my meal!  They also have daily specials which sound awesome, but sadly, I've not gotten to any of those yet due to my burger crush!  I say this about very, very few restaurants, but this is ABSOLUTELY a place for which I'll drive out of my way!!"}
{"text":"The best neighborhood bar and restaurant. Good for families too! Everything tastes great, never in 9 years have we had anything less than great! I love their fried shrimp platter and Reubens. Husband likes pizza and buffalo chicken wrap or salad. Kids love the grilled cheese! Popcorn to snack on  and fish to look at. Lots of evening events, check their schedule. The karaoke is fun."}
{"text":"Food is delishous --steak salad is my fav!!  However bar service has much to be desired, can NEVER get waited on! Don't go thirsty :/"}
{"text":"The bartender warned me it will cost 50 cents for some tartar on my fish. What, why?! I never heard of such a thing. This is such a cheap, penny-pinch tactic, especially when customers are paying $7 for each craft beer with tip, plus another $15 to $20 for food per person. It's not like we're freeloading hogs at a fast food joint, asking for a second portion of dressing for a 99 cent side salad. There are other places in town."}
{"text":"Placed a large takeout fried fish order as part of our Christmas Eve dinner and our guests loved it.   Perfectly done, generous portions and packaged well (huge aluminum chafing dish) for easy warming in the oven.  Our new \"go to\" to help make hosting Christmas Eve a breeze!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  My husband and I have been here several times and haven't gotten a bad meal yet - The pretzels with honey mustard are my fav."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I ever felt more unwelcomed in a restaurant.  We went on a Monday shortly before lunch rush.  The host had his back to the door and was folding napkins/ prepping silverware.  When he eventually noticed us, he sassily told us we could sit wherever we wanted.  Sorry for interrupting your silverware prep, bro... 

The menu was fairly large and somewhat diverse.  I was relieved to see that the gentleman who seated us was not our waiter.  Instead, the bartender was in charge of our table.  My relief was short lived, as while we were attempting to order, the host began to talk over me and hold a dish of creamer for my coffee such that I had to lean around his arm to finish speaking to the waitress.  On his way back to his precious silverware/napkin folding station, the host slammed into the back of my chair, knocking my purse to the ground without hesitation or apology.  It was in no way a tight squeeze.  We were at the very end of the seating area so there wasn't a table behind us-- probably 8+ feet of clearance between me and the wall.   

Once we got our food, we were left to our own devices.  My fajitas were pretty good; definitely not high quality ingredients (the texture of the lettuce told me it'd been sitting out for a while uncovered), but pretty tasty nonetheless.  The waitress/bartender brought us our check in a reasonable matter of time, but took forever to come pick it back up, which was understandable since she was covering so much real estate.

Overall, I'd say this is a pretty standard dive bar with tons of untapped potential.  Nothing about it would compel me to write a Yelp review, but that host has my blood boiling.  

To Rochester Inn Management: If you are interested in figuring out who this was, it was 11/7/16 at about 11:30AM.

EDIT: Please check out the reviews in the \"Not Recommended\" section.  You'll see a lot of remarks confirming that I wasn't the only one treated like garbage here."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service has gone down hill. Pick up the pace and check on your tables. I mean if you want a descent tip and a good review."}
{"text":"I went with my wife and mom on Saturday, 2/18 mostly because of the band Corned Beef and Curry. We really enjoy live music and they are one of the best around. Highly entertaining and not too loud that it is overwhelming. We ordered a few beers and some wings. I ordered the General TSO'S wings which were very good. My wife had a steak wrap that she said was only ok. The place was pretty crowded, but the bartenders did a good job making sure we had a drink. The place is very big for a local bar with many different choices for seating. We elected to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"So sad. This place used to have the best wings in the city. Just got some tonight they must have switched to the breaded wings. Absolutely awful. I wouldn't feed these to a dog"}
{"text":"Great service but could use more wait staff on weekends.
2nd Favorite wings in the North Hills !
Hot -n-spicy rock ! Hardwood Pizza is awesome but menu should expand on a great thing. Like offer other types of wood fired pizza ? Ham/spam and Pineapple, Greek Style,Full on Pepperoni. One down side is the place is very noisy ! Need some tile to dampen the voices.
The popcorn machine burns the popcorn and tastes off. that need serviced.
Other wise great food great taste and nice people.
Brooke and Kursten Rock !
Make a Grilled  and smoked Salmon sandwich. I will buy it.

Rob."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I went to The Rochester for lunch on a Tuesday. The burger with a side AND soft drink deal was a great price and the food was delicious. While you can get french fries or coleslaw as a side, it was also nice to have pasta salad as an option.      I chose the pasta salad, and I will definitely get it again. Thanks for a great lunch at an awesome price!"}
