{"text":"The food is  quite good and true to home style cooking.  Very friendly good service"}
{"text":"I had breakfast today with a friend on a Saturday at about 11.  Immediately seated,  staff and owner very friendly. Service was very efficient, food superb. I ordered the Farmers market omelette. The ingredients were super fresh and omelette fluffy and light with perfect balance of flavors. Rosemary potatoes were the best I've ever had, perfectly seasoned, crispy and dark on the outside, soft and sweet inside. Five stars for food, service and ambience. It's a quiet, cozy place with soft and romantic ambience. Great place for a quiet conversation. One mild complaint for me was that the air in the restaurant was too warm for me and it really needed more circulation, so If I were the proprietor I would add ceiling fans which would have made my experience absolutely perfect.   I'm a regular customer at the nearby \"General Store\" which is good, but often crowded and clattery, with longer wait times. I'm happy to have discovered Emily's, and I will become a regular here now for sure."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and delicious! I recommend Emily's Cafe to anyone hungry for an elegant twist on homestyle American brunch. Two days a week I have the pleasure to dine here for lunch, having enjoyed numerous dishes every single one has been phenomenal! Salmon Omelette for the win, unearthing the hidden cream cheese was like finding gold. Today I am enjoying the e-lox bagel, and it is amazing. Thank you Kathy!"}
{"text":"My friend and I just had a lovely lunch in the courtyard. The tuna nicoise salad was very good- nicely presented, fresh veggies, perfectly cooked tuna. Joe, the affable, warm and friendly young waiter was very accommodating when I asked to have one of the grilled chicken sandwiches served on a bed of salad instead of focaccia. While I would have liked more seasoning, that's just a personal preference. And the freshly brewed ice tea is very refreshing and tasty. Kathy, the owner, was very welcoming and told us all about her story, and her daughter Emily. We will definitely be coming back and bringing our husbands. A must try for a casual breakfast or lunch if you live in north Scottsdale and wondering where to go. We wish Kathy all the best in her new endeavor."}
{"text":"The breakfasts at Emily's are amazing- fresh and flavorful. Highly recommend the French Toast.  I read on Yelp that the owner, Kathy, has sold the business, which is not true. Only recomendation I have is that I think they need more waitstaff as the girl that works during the week is a bit slow."}
{"text":"I should've known it was going to be a problem when I walked into the half empty restaurant on a Sunday morning and had to fight to gain eye contact with anybody that worked there to get seated.  But at that point, when you say \"There are two of us\", you are sorta committed to the place.  A few minutes later another person came and seated us.  This turned out to then be our waitress also.  It seems that maybe they each seat people as they desire in their sections?  Not sure.  But there were 4 people waiting tables and 11 tables with people.  So I cannot fathom how service could be so incredibly poor.  

And when I say that the service was poor, please don't mis-interpret that the staff was rude or otherwise because they were not.  Everybody was fairly friendly and courteous etc...  But they just seemed to be running around aimlessly.   It became comical to a certain extent because we didn't really have anyplace else to be.  But all the tables of people seemed to be rolling eyes at one another at how long it could possibly be to get the check.  Or to order their food or even get a refill of iced tea.  

There were tables that had still been left uncleaned from gosh knows how long before we arrived that were still that way after we left.  Our waitress was quick to explain that \"They had been crazy\" before we got there.  But for the entire hour or more that we were there all four servers were acting like they were in the midst of a \"rush\", but there was no crowd there.  They ran around and around once in awhile bringing food out with them or something.  I waited 15 minutes for the check after they'd taken my dates plate and left mine empty (so they knew we were done), but our waitress was somehow MIA.  I had to ask one of the other servers.

I give them two stars because it wasn't entirely unpleasant.  Once again, all nice people.  But if you've gotta be somewhere...anywhere else that day make sure you think twice before hitting this place up.  

Also, the food really was very good.  Almost worth the rest.  As I said to my date \"I do have to admit that this is probably the best French Toast I've had in ages\", because it was.  But when you spend $13 for two pieces of Toast with no sides it damned well better be the best you've ever had.  And if you want to split anything they charge $3 for that.  Who really does this anymore?  My date ordered the salmon BLT and that was $17.  So the pricing is a little outta whack for breakfast too.

Anywhoo...food quite good but too expensive and the service just ridiculous.  Probably not heading back anytime soon.  Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Really, the food here is decent, but unfortunately, the service is far from even decent. I've gone twice and each time we are sitting there with no water, waiting for something for way too long, and waiting empty-plated for a check for far too long. Both times I've been in, it's been empty, and there is no question why- I doubt they have any regulars here."}
{"text":"the atmosphere and food is pretty good, but the servers are inattentive and are always forgetful. I hope they can improve soon because it does have the potential to be a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite local spots! Don't let the negative reviews deter you. We have breakfast here at least once a month and have always received good service, so whatever kinks there may have been at one point have all been worked out. The people who own the restaurant are incredibly friendly and nice as are the staff. Not to mention a great French cafe ambience. But enough about service and ambience, the test of a good restaurant is really the FOOD. And the food here is always delicious. We've tried practically everything on the menu, and it's safe to say it's all good. A couple of the true highlights are the eggs benedict and salmon BLT - some of the best in the valley! So go give Emily's a chance! Not just for your own enjoyment but to help keep this great local spot open because it's in a really tough location and needs more customers!"}
{"text":"When you're tired of waiting in line at the more obvious breakfast joints, try Emily's.   It is at the corner of Pima and Pinnacle Peak in a small corporate complex.  Its sign and outdoor area face Pinnacle Peak, but you'd never know it because its so hidden.    We had omelettes that were both great (ham for him, and salmon for me), no wait, nice quiet atmosphere, good service.  Loved the herbed breakfast potatoes.

The \"Emily's Cafe\" sign DOES show when you're driving Pinnacle Peak, which I noticed one day and looked it up later.   Now that we found it, we'll probably go back regularly!

Be forewarned the menu is very limited, but if you find something you like, you can go back over and over for that item."}
{"text":"Horrible.   Every thing about it was horrible.  The uptight gay guy who \"greeted\" us looked like he'd rather take a bowel movement than deal with us......the waitress informed me they were \"86 my choice\" on the menu so I was shit out of luck.  I ended up ordering a cheeseburger thinking no one can screw that up and was told when the meal was delivered (not before) that they were out of the potato salad that was supposed to come with it.  When I wanted another glass of wine the anal gay guy looked perturbed and said \"I'll let your wait person know....\"...OMG what a joke.  We will NEVER come here again.  I kept asking staff....where is the owner?...she must care about this...."}
{"text":"We love this place!! It's so cute and comfortable, like having breakfast at grandma's house when you were a kid. Best french toast in town, and love the quiet, relaxed environment. We love doing brunch Saturday mornings here, the food is delish! ;)"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star, I would. The service is the worst I've encountered in this area. I have a 2 year old and his pancake not only arrived last by 5 minutes but came undercooked. The waitress also had to remind the cook to make it. The farmers omelette that I ordered tasted like old shoe leather and my English muffin was as hard as a hockey puck. 
My mother ordered the over the border omelette and asked if it was spicy. The waitress replied that it was not at all spicy. However, the first bite made it clear that she had lied. Her toast was also burned and hard as a rock.
We had to ask for menus, cream, etc. 
Summary: food inedible and service deplorable. Skip it- don't waste your money or your stomach."}
{"text":"Love going to Emily's and very happy that they started serving breakfast everyday (except Tuesdays when they are closed). I've been here several times and my favorites are the Salmon spinach salad (I do half arugula half spinach), the chicken focaccia, the chorizo burrito, and the burger (with bacon and avocado). Everything is made from scratch, so expect to have a little bit of a wait, but it's worth it. 

All my friends rave about the french toast and pancakes, but I usually always want protein so I stick to my favorites! Very good food, sweet owner, cute place!"}
{"text":"The croque is amazing. The stuffed French toast is to die for. Have been here several times for brunch and lunch and everything has always been fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Not the healthy cafe they advertise themselves to be. Hardly anything fresh on the menu. Just the same tired over cooked food, with too much white flour and sugar. I asked for the Avocado & Grapefruit Salad, since it was the only fresh item on the menu. Wanting less sugar in my diet, I asked if they could make it heavy on the avocado. Our server said, \"No. That would mean we would need to open a new avocado, and we're trying not to make any mistakes in the kitchen today.\" Really. Even though we live across the street, and would LOVE to support a good new restaurant, we won't be back."}
{"text":"The food here is terrific. The borderline omelette is delicious and very unique. Everything was very fresh. The service was terrific. Lovely owner who is very helpful. Not busy, which is too bad, because it really is a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today, first time here. It was such a beautiful day that we sat at an outside table and enjoyed tbe closeby bubbling fountains.  The chairs could've been more comfortable if they would only put cushions over the metal seats.

We ordered wine, they only had 6 breakfast styled cocktails but no prob my fave is on the menu bellinis were ordered. 10 minutes later we were told they didn't have. So we ordered the mimosas without the oj.  It took 20 minutes to get our drinks,  20 more to finally get food.  We were the only ones sitting outside perhaps explains the very slow service.  There were multiple wait staff, they weren't that busy.  Took forever to get our bill.

We ordered the ruben and caprese on ciabbatta, fabulous. The side salads were simply lightly dressed the way I like them.  The food deserves 4.5 stars, but the inattentive service dragged the score down to 3.  Too bad"}
{"text":"Despite the reviews about slow waiting times we tried this out today, 5/22/16 and found service and staff to be very friendly and prompt.  It's a great little area and nice seating area, indoor and out.  We arrived around 10am and there was only 3-4 other tables seated and no wait.  Overall everything was ok, my criticism would come with the menu, several items were simply blacked out and there wasn't a real large choice of menu items.  When the food arrived it was good but not anything great, just ok.  My suggestion would be to reprint new menus without the blacked out items and add a few other options(biscuits and gravy, gluten free items, and fruit) and oatmeal shouldn't cost $10 bucks!"}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot without much problems.  Now tying to get breakfast and have been waiting over an hour.  Order was taken 15 minutes ago and nobody around us has food including us.  Started with\"no silverware\" as an excuse but this is just extremely poor service overall."}
{"text":"We hesitated to try this restaurant due to mixed reviews but so glad we did! Our breakfast and service were both very good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really high quality brunch and lunch food. We had no problem with service, but the place was pretty quiet. I recommend the lox,  the salmon BLT, and the benedict royale."}
{"text":"Loved it for breakfast. Had the borderline omlet and it was amazing. Great presentation, very fresh and flavorful. I expected to pay a lot more than I did."}
{"text":"We love Emily's Cafe! The Challah French Toast is incredible - it will ruin every other French Toast you have ever or will ever have. Located in the quiet Citadel complex, it's serene just walking in! Furnished and decorated so perfectly. I've been here many times and will go back again and again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for several times a week for a few weeks now and I absolutely love the food. There is a nice selection at this nice cozy cafe. So far I have eaten from Salmon BLT to a breakfast burrito ( and a mixture of dishes in-between). Everything is always fresh and very tasty and well worth the money spent. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Food is good,but service is sooooo slow! Come if your not in a hurry! Very cute small, not great for large parties...Good Coffee"}
{"text":"We went to Emily's for brunch last Saturday. I had been wanting to check it out as it is right by our house. It's located inside the citadel which has been a ghost town since the economy took a dive. We were really excited when we saw some restaurants opening up here. 
Our server was very young, but sweet and attentive. She offered to have the kitchen make my 4 year old daughter Nutella pancakes which were not on the menu. They were amazing! I had the turkey avocado eggs benedict. It was good, but not life changing. My in-laws who we were dining with us said their meals were both delicious. The place is cute, but was empty. Another table was seated as we were leaving, but before that, we were the only customers. I hope they can keep the doors open. This place has promise!"}
{"text":"I'm being gracious here.  If you like the dirty, old fashioned \"hick\" hillbilly feel, then this place is 4U. Terrible, rude customer service by some young weird looking chic who is a busboy. She has 2 toned color hair. Warning:  She usually works A.M. shift.  Asked her politely for an extra set of napkin with utensils and she just stared at me without a word and walked away.  Seriously?!  This cafe seriously needs employee retraining.  If busboy gal doesn't like her job, then quit, get a REAL job, or get an education.  All waitresses and real male busboys are polite here except for skunk head busboy chic."}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing. There are many good breakfast places in north Scottsdale but the food at Emily's is a step above the rest. It is pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Just went to Emily's for lunch. Very pleasantly surprised after reading several opening reviews from March.  The service was great with drinks to include very flavorful iced tea served almost immediately.  My spouse enjoyed the Club which was topped with avocado.  Yummy!!!  I had the Salmon BLT.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and with bacon and aioli  a great sandwich!!  The server stated that she was new on the job and was likewise concerned about the past reviews.  My observation is that this quaint cafe has much to offer!!! I would recommend without reservation."}
{"text":"Had Sat late lunch around 1:30pm.  We were  the only customers in the restaurant.  Service was reasonably prompt and the food was 4 star+.  3 star rating due to tables in restaurant not being bused after their lunch rush.  Just seemed sloppy to have so many dirty tables.  Owner was wearing a yoga workout outfit which seemed unprofessional for the environment.  They recently got an expresso machine but nobody knows how to use it.  Place has potential but they could use a little training to improve operations.  Might go back."}
{"text":"I just recently tried Emily's Café again after taking a break from it for awhile. I did not have a good experience last time I was here because I felt that their was something wrong and the owner did not seem like she was herself and their were new waiters that had no clue what they were doing.  Anyway I have found out my last visit here that she had sold the café to some other people.  The food I can't even consider it to be ok; it is not good at all and is way over priced for the portion size.  The service is horrible to they have no clue what they are doing; they never check on you to see how you are doing.  It is really sad that the owner had to sell it for reasons that are unknown because this was such a good little place to eat at with you family and friends in a warm and inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"I tried the BLTA the first time and the BLT the second time. AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.  If you are a bacon lover...loads of bacon..super flavor and crunch.  My daughter and wife ordered the french toast...also awesome.  Super Super service.  My glass of iced tea and water were always full and the wait person was highly attentive.  This was on Mother's Day and the place was packed.  Odd some of the reviews I have read, seems like they were looking for a night club vs a breakfast/lunch establishment.  
Great place Great Food."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast this morning and it was quite awful.  The service was slow and inattentive, but the food was the biggest problem.  I ordered bacon and eggs with potatoes and an english muffin and my wife ordered a greek omelette with bacon, potatoes and an english muffin.  Her omelette was so under cooked that the egg was actually liquid on the inside.  Both of our bacon had a strange after taste that led us to believe that it was very old or possibly freezer burnt.  The muffin were both burnt.

After about 15 minutes and our server never checking in with us i approached who I believe is the manager at the front and told her about the issues with the food.  Her exact response was \"that's impossible\".  At that point I told her that the food was a health risk and that we were leaving.  We left a tip on the table and left.

We went here because of some of the good reviews, but it appears that this place is going downhill.  They cut back their menu offering significantly and apparently can't even cook eggs properly now.

I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Very cute place!!  Went for brunch on a Saturday. French toast is delicious!  I got an omelet which was also great!  I hope it stays in business. We were the only ones there."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast one morning and really enjoyed the food. Although they weren't busy, the server was very attentive, friendly, and efficient. I would highly recommend this cafe. The only downside is that it was very warm in the restaurant. Servings are large enough to split and prices are fair. It is hard to find in the building complex where they are located but there is a sign facing Pinnacle Peak Rd."}
{"text":"Not interested in our business 15 minutes.before closing time. I own a small business and if I ever had an employee turn away a new customer, I would fire them. Good luck to you."}
{"text":"Emily's is fantastic! I come here multiple times a week for lunch. The owner Kathy is personable and truly cares about your experience. The chicken focaccia is incredible and she gives the option to substitute almost anything you need. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing lunch in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very good food with excellent prices! I especially love that they cater to vets. I eat breakfast here 1-2x per week with my dad. The atmosphere is perfect for father/ daughter time!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Tasted like home food, and the service is outstanding. Very friendly and welcoming!!
We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in today (our first visit) at 10am for breakfast. It's such a hidden gem, or so we thought. From the charming decor, we really thought we were in for a very special treat.

That's until we read the menus. Instead of printing up new menus, they took a black marker and crossed off many items and increased the prices on everything. We wouldn't mind the price increase, but the overall effect of presenting a crappy looking, worn out menu is SO TACKY. It's not like they have expensive menu covers. We're talking a piece of paper encased in thin plastic. If the owner is reading this review, PLEASE spring for a few new menus! How much does Kinkos charge to print menus? It can't be much. 

We both ordered omelets. Nothing to get excited about, but they were edible. The menu says \"breakfast entrees served with fresh fruit\". But what was served was a tiny sliver (and I mean a teeny tiny sliver measuring 1\" wide x 3\" long) of UNRIPE watermelon. Just based on that sad presentation alone, I would NEVER come back. 

The ice tea is lightly colored water with zero tea flavor. Don't bother ordering it. I asked for a glass of tea without ice, thinking the ice had watered it down, but unfortunately they just don't know how to brew ice tea. 

The worse part, there were only 4 customers (and that included the two of us) but we waited ... and waited ... and waited ... for the waitress to bring us our check but she never returned so we had to get up and find her to pay our bill. 

All in all a very disappointing experience. Yet the atmosphere is so lovely, it cries out for something better! 

Suggestion to Management: 
1) hire a creative cook 
2) update your menu offerings
3) print some new menus"}
{"text":"Maybe we should have gone for breakfast, instead of dinner. Based on the reviews, it seems that may be their specialty...because it's definitely not dinner. The service was very good and friendly, but the menu is unimaginative and the price-value ratio is way out of whack...$17 for a salad nicoise that wasn't as good as i'd make at home, and $25 for a bottle of wine that retails for $8. Hubby isn't interested in going back, but since they're close by for us, I'd like to see if they do a better job with breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow, some tough reviews here... most of them see to be when they opened.  Just tried it for first time.. had to get it go due to time crunch.  Definitely had some promise, will try to dine in next time... Looks Family owned and neat.  Just moved to an office in neighborhood and will try a couple of more times and update my review her..."}
{"text":"Looking for something other than the usual IHOP for the family. THIS PLACE IS A HIDDEN GEM!!I had a Cobb  salad for 7.99. That's cheaper than it was 20 years ago. What surprised me though was the presentation. It just wasn't slapped together. Cooks took their time. The toppings were fresh. Turkey and ham was cut and the cheeses were sliced perfectly. Let's just say that you got your money's worth. The kids who are picky, both enjoyed the kids menus and the plain beef tacos looked very good.

Service was excellent and laid back. 

I also split a chicken quesadilla. Let me tell you God's honest truth. That was the best 3.99 money ever spent. I swear, It was the best quesadilla I ever ordered but then again I have never ordered a chicken cheese Q. It's extremely larger than your average Q.

The negatives was none except it was located in an open air casino. And the music was awesome. Either classic hits from Sam Cook or The Miracles or 80's hits like Soft Cell or Modern English. Very eclectic tastes"}
{"text":"I think this place is a hidden gem. One because it is very hidden; it's in a corporate complex on the northwest corner of Pima and Pinnacle Peak. My girlfriends and I came here after working an early event. We all really enjoyed our meals. Every omelette I have tried has been fantastic. Farmhouse peaceful atmosphere"}
{"text":"Can't review the food, sadly.  Second time we have come and second time that we had to leave after not receiving any service, this time for more than 20 minutes after being seated.  The table next to us leaned over and said they had been there for 2 hours and had just received their food.  Thought maybe they had gotten the bugs worked out by now, guess not.  We won't be back for a third attempt."}
{"text":"We were in town for a few days and don't like eating at the big hotels that charge crazy prices for breakfast.  So we stumbled upon this place and were pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the breakfast burrito.  Very good.  The service was good and friendly.  Kind of an out of the way place in a strip mall complex, but very comfortable. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest of places. I came here after an appointment on a Wednesday morning at 9am, wanting to grab breakfast somewhere I haven't been before. It was not very busy which was to be expected as I'm sure most people in this area are working. The cafe is tucked into an outdoor medical plaza. I walked in and a gal stood up and looked at me like \"what do u want\", and was apparently the owner? Still not sure...I paid at the register and sat, waited for my breakfast sandwich. I probably would've ordered a coffee or drink but I felt rushed and just kind of forgot, and she never asked if I needed anything else. My breakfast sandwich was good, just good, and was served with chips...thought that was weird. It was 9 in the morning. Maybe if I was a regular and worked in the area, I'd come back but I think I'd go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"What a gem we found for lunch today!  With out of town colleagues and we were looking for a quick place to eat, we stumbled upon Emily's.  The atmosphere is tranquil and quaint, and the food was amazing!  From the chicken tortilla soup, to the Waldorf salad, to the grilled cheese sandwich (it's such an understatement to call it that), the food was fresh, delicious, different and just enough in quantity.  We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was slow. Hard to find. Tucked in by several empty businesses. Probably not go back"}
{"text":"A little piece of paradise for the senses!!! Great atmosphere, amazing fresh food, and super sweet customer service at acceptable prices!!! I never drink coffee and had a dark chocolate mocha worth breaking my 14 year coffee free streak!!! Love love love everything!!!"}
{"text":"Trying for the first time... Been waiting for our server after seating for 15 minutes.  Not a fan 

Crap service. We decided to leave."}
{"text":"It is now called Club Cafe.  Some new items have been added and plan to try them all.  I ordered the fish and chips and she ordered the Fortune Club.  We both shared the club which was excellent.  Could not eat the fish and chips.  Very soggy and floppy.  Oil must have just been turned on.  Hope they take care of that problem.  Fries included.  Looking forward to trying the new items."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'd have to agree with previous reviewers. My family and I came for breakfast on Father's Day and we were promptly seated, which was promising but then it stopped there. 
Our waitress seemed less than pleased to be there. She spent most of our meal, seated in the corner with another gentleman patron. (Maybe her husband? Maybe just a friend) but with her back to us and enjoying a meal of her own, it was virtually impossible to get service at our own table. It's not like the place was empty either. Every table was full and growing impatient, just like us. 
Our breakfast, in such a small place, should not have taken over an hour. 
The menu is limited and the service is awful. We definitely won't be going back. 
They get two stars only because the food was actually pretty good. The lack of service is what totally ruined it, which seems to be the norm here."}
{"text":"The chicken quesadilla we ordered to start with was $5. I expected a tiny skimpy thing to come out, it was huge. It was big enough to fill me up on one of the four pieces. Really perfect to soak up alcohol at midnight. So I had to stop to leave room for the chicken parmesan entree. Which was fairly huge for the price."}
{"text":"Emily's is actually in the complex I work at so it's very handy. The food is always so good and fresh. If you need anything special they can most likely make it for you. I've had many different items on the menu from the Salmon BLT, Grilled Cheese to the Ahi Tuna salad. You cannot go wrong with anything here!!!"}
{"text":"Most of the food is good with excellent pricing. The staff treats us like family (probably because we visit so frequently) I LOVE the chicken tortilla soup they have on Tuesdays. I just wish they would bring back those amazing corn muffins"}
{"text":"Menus are completely different than the ones shown online. Menus in the restaurant are much more limited. Additionally, the limited menus they do have have all of the prices crossed out with black marker and have a price 2-3 dollars higher scribbled in. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"What a hidden treasure.  The food is amazing, huge proportions, and excellent quality.  I especially love the fried egg sandwich, Delish!  Best part is that you can actually get in on a weekend in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent comfort food at very pleasant family run restaurant. Went for dinner tonight. Creamy pesto penne with chicken is best Italian dish I've had in the area. Service was stellar and owners personable."}
{"text":"Genise is a awesome server!! Food was great. I had the French Dip with Onion Rings. Sooooo good!! MIL. had the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich with Onion rings she said it was amazing.. The staff was friendly except the lady doing the waiting list names she had no customer service qualities at all. And the lady who seems to be a manager her name was Lisa she looked like she was in a bad mood or something she didnt once smile while we were there. But over all i gave a 5 star for food and for Genise."}
{"text":"This place is so quaint  makes you feel at home  the place is designed very nicely . The food was very very good everything on the menu looks awesome can't wait to come back and try everything else.  Very nice place I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Decide to try Emily's even though the other reviews weren't that great.  As I read the service was terrible.  He was not a server.  To get his attention we had to knock on the window.  I wanted to order sparkling water (Perrier) they didn't have anything like it.  The salad came and I was glad the dressing was on the side.  It had a terrible taste.  I asked if they had another dressing.  He brought me a bottle of balsamic vinegar.  They only have one dressing.  We were given the check without asking if we might have wanted dessert or coffee.  I wanted to order a cappuccino. He said the machine was broken.  It was a terrible experience,  I won't go back.  A woman sat inside the whole time and not once did she come and check on us.  I assumed she might be Emily.  
I won't recommend Emily's nor will I ever go back."}
{"text":"This cute little French resturant is great. The food is exceptional. Service is right on. We have been 3 times and going again tonight. We tried   Salmon with Spinach with Lemon Buerre Blanc and also Chicken Breast with Arugula, and Roasted Corn.  Delicious both, we are sort of stuck on the salmon but hear the meatloaf it good.  I just hope they make it sort of tucked back in the Citidal on conner of Pinnacle Peek and Pema. I wish they would offer local dines or something to let people know they are there.  Love it."}
{"text":"They need to improve their service, else this place is going to shut down very soon. Two and half hours for a group of 6 to be served breakfast is not the best way of spending your Sunday mornings. And through the wait we noticed many diners leaving their seats because they had not been served even after waiting 30 mins. Food was good, but on top of the delays were mistakes made to orders and they started running out of items mid course ( they were out of sauté'd potatoes and asked if it could be replaced with potato salad ).

It has the potential but steer clear for the moment."}
{"text":"Visited Emily's after Saturday evening church .  Arrived around 6:30 pm and there was only one other couple in the restaurant.  We were a bit skeptical and decided to give it a go.
Glad we did.  The avocado grapefruit salad was wonderful.  What a great summer salad.  Light and full of flavor.  We also partook in the caprese salad.  Fresh, flavorful,  and mouth watering.  
The warm bread was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  It was warm and the butter melted perfectly.  If I wasn't trying to cut back on carbs I would have asked for another.  
For dinner I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken served with greens and corn-yummy.  So much left over I brought it home and ate it for lunch the next day.  My spouse ordered the meatloaf and mash potatoes. ...wait for it...wait for it...dang it was good.  Again, so much left over we brought it home.
By the time we left two more couples had arrived.  My concerns is this place is so nestled in the back of the Citadel that they may lose business.  For those that have been before and experienced poor service I hope you give it another go.  We have plans to return.

{"text":"I must say I was excited to go to Emily's. our favorite meal out is always Sunday brunch. When we walked in the ambiance was absolutely charming, clean, and inviting.  For this, I give it both stars.  We chose a seat by the window, with a pretty view of a fountain. That's where the good part ends. When we ordered mimosas to start the server informed us the have pomegranate fruity ones. No problem, I love a good mimosa. When it was delivered it seriously tasted like a very rich fruit juice. I asked her to please top my glass off with champagne and she brought me less than an ounce in a flute. Totally ripped off on the   My husband ordered an omelet and  I ordered the eggs Benedict, potatoes crispy. I emphasized CRISPY!  When the food was delivered our potatoes must've been soaked in olive oil before cooking. They were soggy but flavorful, albeit super fattening.   My Benedict had a slice of tomato between the Canadian bacon and the muffin so my muffin was totally soggy!  My husband said his omelet was ok but no where near as good as all the other places around. I'm surprised because they are located across the street to our favorite breakfast place (The General Store) which has great quality food at a good price. Ok, so back to the final check!  It came to $49!  Those mimosas with little to no champagne cost $10 each!!  If I had know that I would not have ordered. I would only pay that much if they were unlimited. We will definitely NOT be back!"}
{"text":"I liked this place the service was very good ... I liked my food also I got the special and my daughter in law Brandi got a cheese burger that looked really good and when the bill came it was right under 20 bucks wtf for two people really when's the last time you got full on good good for that low of a price ! And it was greasy fast food"}
{"text":"No management,  only a floor supervisor that looks completely stressed out.  99 percent of the food is nasty.  Please get some cooks that understand cooking temperatures. Obviously the way the staff operates there is no customer service training at all as well wait staff doesn't understand health department regulations.  Between counting there money while on the floor and touching there hair and face then going back to the kitchen and coming right out and serve out food. Hostess May and Rosa are awesome. 
To bad they killed the special (baseball cut sirloin)
But the breakfast special rocks. But knowing the owner that will be gone soon to. My advice head on over to Emerald Island casino down town Henderson where you will find the best customer service and most awesome food. The only reason I gave more than 1 star good breakfast special and that's it."}
{"text":"New name - Club Cafe; some changes to menu.
Dropped the Wednesday's soup of the day - Wisconsin Cheese Soup. One of our favs. BOO!
Some other changes to the menu, most good choices; some are not.
The spaghetti is gone - but the Chicken Parm is still there.
Keep trying the items to see how they are"}
{"text":"A quaint little breakfast spot!  Good food, good atmosphere, nice people. We had a nice time here. Will come again."}
{"text":"Tried Emily's today because it popped up as close by on my phone. No greeting when we walked in, no sign to let us know to seat ourselves, waitstaff walked right past us as we were standing in the middle of the dining room. Got past that, party seated after us had order taken before us. Ordered borderline omelet and BLTA, which arrived promptly and looked great. It tasted great too (comments about brown eggs in other review,  that's the chorizo). Sandwich very good, side salad is a lightly dressed arugula, potatoes did NOT have too much Rosemary). Seasonings are all listed on menu, so if you don't like Rosemary, ask for a substitution. Prices fair, portions just fine. Check easy to get. They just need to up their game on the greeting/welcome and they'd be a nicer experience. We would go back for breakfast and we might try lunch sometime."}
{"text":"We have recently been to Emily's Café for the fourth time and  I felt compelled to write a review. We are absolutely in love with this little restaurant and have taken 10 people with us over the four visits and they all loved it as well. It's small and has a friendly, comfortable feel. The owner is always there because she is the only chef. The food is outstanding with a mix of comfort and gourmet! The prices are reasonable and sometimes even Emily is there - skating, helping out and talking to the customers. It's a must!"}
{"text":"My family and i love this place. They always honor active and veteran military,  which is big plus for our family"}
{"text":"Service and food was amazing. This is a hidden gem!!!! The French toast is delicious. Do not pass this place up!!!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm even giving them a star is because the food is decent. The service is extremely slow, and the waitresses are always grumpy. However I understand why they're grumpy. It must be very hard working everyday and having way too many tables to handle. Clearly management has no clue how to run a restaurant. I literally just seen a very busy waitress spill a drink, and watched the manager walk right past, drop a cone and keep walking to the front. Lazy and terrible \" team \" skills. They are very understaffed. We have come here several times because the breakfast is good, so it took me several visits to actually rate this place. Also... The tables are poorly maintained, they are very wobbly. Its very uncomfortable eating when every time you touch the table is wobbles. This is all due to poor management I'm sure."}
{"text":"Located in the prior Cafe Ted location........Outstanding dinner at Emily's Café on our first visit.  Want to go back again tomorrow for weekend Brunch, and we will for sure.  We sat outside and had excellent service from Elizabeth.
Shared the simple, but amazing grapefruit and avocado salad, followed by best Salmon with Spinach with Lemon Buerre Blanc and also Chicken Breast with Arugula, and Roasted Corn.  Amazing Food Quality and Presentation.  Met Emily, who is Owner's Daughter - she was helping and was delightful.  Overall a very pleasant experience and we will be back again and again.  Thank you for wonderful dinner experience.  If you want best \"foodie\" experience in quiet little space - please visit Emily's Cafe"}
{"text":"Cute little spot, with healthy food. Great place to stop by after an early hike in the mountains near by (if you ever hike up Tom's Thumb, this is the perfect spot to go eat right after). Try the bagel with lox or the proscuito, asparagus and béchamel sauce on a brioche."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS as in Pretty Good

    Emily's Cafe is really Club Fortune Casino's Cafe. Yesterday it served my post-hike supper. I had spent the better hours of the afternoon hiking the Henderson trail network to the foothills of the River Mountains. I had used the Club Fortune parking lot as the trailhead. Subsequently to over eight miles of hiking, the right thing to do was support the business where I parked my vehicle. 

   What is so noticiceable about Emily's Cafe is what is unnoticeable: the cafe. It just blends in with the casino. There is very little signing, advertising, or interior design to draw people to the place. Hitherto the Yelp reviews, I'd mistake the undecorated white walled room of tables for a Bingo lounge. 

   There is better attention to the food and locals than the interior design that more resembles an Indian Gambling Hall than a Las Vegas casino. 

   Right from the get go I was cognizant that the locals appreciate Emily's Cafe. There was a line of locals waiting to enjoy some good food. Immediately after giving my name, the friendly hostess led me to my table of one. 

   On the table was a paper place mat that promoted the daily specials and March events. I included a picture of it below. Nearby was the menu loaded with comfort food at good prices. I was decided on the veal parmigiano with spaghetti in marinara sauce. 

   This is the first time that I have enjoyed veal parmigiano in years and possibly a couple of decades. I have had chicken and eggplant parmigiano but not veal. This is the first casino cafe where I saw it offered. At $9.49, veal parmigiano and spaghetti with soup or salad was a good deal. From the time that I ordered the Pepsi to when I left, Genise was a pleasant server. Genise let fall that the chicken with broccoli soup was made in house and was very good. My taste buds were in agreement. In similar fashion to Emily's Cafe being the first casino cafe to offer veal parmegaino, it was the first to offer a cornbread muffin. The cornbread muffin was a delicious compliment to the cup of soup. A few minutes further, Genise served the plate of veal parmigiano with spaghetti and shaker of grated cheese. The veal parmegaino and spaghetti were outstanding just like the trails I just hiked on. Tge veal parmegaino was one large slab of delicious meat with spaghetti on the side. I really didn't need the grated cheese. By the time that Genise handed me the check for $11.89; I was filled to the point that dessert was unnecessary. 

   Another observation is that the locals who support Emily's Cafe were friendly. When I was on line, a local gave me a heads up to give them  my name before waiting. After the meal when I was in the cashier line to pay and get change to tip the waitress, I intentionally left my jacket at the table so the waitress did not think that I was leaving without tipping. Anyways an older gentleman ran up to the line to hand me the jacket that he thought I left behind. There is definitely a community feel to Emily's Cafe. Likewise the nearby hiking trails that I spend time on are a part of the nature community. And when I return to the Saguaro Trail and nearby nature community, I could be headed back to Emily's Cafe."}
{"text":"Food here is fresh and delicious. The restaurant is new so the servers are getting their bearings but if you let them know you are on a time crunch - they step it up. I think with time it will all gel. Meantime, I've had two meals here and both were excellent. Also, the decaf Americano the barrista made for me was extra yum... rich, solid, and satisfying. Our waiter, Joe, was a total delight and told me I looked like Lana Del Rey... which made my day! :) I don't care if he was shining it on... what woman doesn't want to be flirted with and feel pretty all while eating fresh, healthy food?"}
{"text":"Was not acknowledged at the entrance and watch 8 employes walk by and no one asked for assistance. Shame that even when they gave us our drinks, we seen our waiter be friendly with our neighbor tables and not care about us!!!! Don't go there! They do not  have the the staff to accommodate! Do not go there!!! Not GAY FRIENDLY!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Emily's Cafe three times already in the last three weeks.  Each time it was a great experience...breakfast and lunch. The menu is terrific and the preparations are very innovative.  The staff is extremely nice and everything comes out perfect.  Can't wait to try dinner!!  I hope this restaurant is successful, as you can see that they really care to please their customers."}
{"text":"The people were nice. The portions were huge. Reasonable prices. Sat out on the patio near the waterfall."}
{"text":"Stopped by Emily's Cafe for the first time this morning for a late breakfast. Crowds were light.  Actually, my wife and I were the only ones in the cafe. Staff was friendly, prompt and attentive. Food was excellent. My wife loved the fried egg sandwich. I enjoyed the smoked salmon omelet. The omelet was perfect. I was a bit worried that the cream cheese might overwhelm the omelet, but it was perfect with the spinach, tomatoes and seasoning.  Only complaint... we couldn't finish as the portions were generous.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has good old American comfort food at a reasonable price.  The food is inexpensive and tastes good.  Who could ask for more?   But wait, they do have more! They also have daily specials which are incredibly inexpensive. So you really can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Came first time after deciding not to wait over 1/2 hr at a nearby restaurant. So happy that happened as I loved Emiliy's and have told numerous people about it."}
{"text":"Found Emily's on Yelp - the reviews were pretty good and we were STARVING!!  Walked in and had to fight the urge to do an about face.  My husband was getting a little hangry so we stayed - and boy am I glad we did!  I admit I was expecting something a little more aesthetically pleasing, but it turns out the place was much more than just the lazy little diner it appeared to be.  

The service was dynamite!  We were so well taken care of, we had three different people serving us.  The servers were polite, friendly, and kept our drinks topped off.  They were not intrusive but gave us just the right amount of attention.

The food HIT. THE. SPOT!!  My husband ordered chicken and mashed potatoes.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  I had been craving a pastrami Reuben for DAYS - it was not on the menu but my request was accommodated with no issue.  The sandwich blew my mind!  It was hot, melty, crunchy, and delicious; easily the best I've ever had!  Not only was the food absolutely delicious but the prices were unbelievably good for the amount of food we got.  

The cherry on my sundae came when I heard the story about the old portrait of a handsome military man on the wall - the owner's grandfather.  The owners really value veterans and I understand they provide free lunches to vets on Veteran's Day.  Wish I would have had more time to check out all the military photos on the wall.  

Give Emily's a shot.  You'll be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"My wife and  I were looking forward to dinner at Emily's as it finally filled the space that was Cafe Ted, which for years was one of our all time favorites.  The only real positive was the space which was nicely done,
But with an odd grouping of tables - mostly six or eight tops?
To start, our server did not know anything about the menu.  My wife ordered a glass of wine, and it was the smallest pour I have seen in a restaurant.  She is a small person, but her chicken with corn and arugula was so small she headed for our fridge when we got home.  My 40 cloves of chicken was good but two chicken thighs for $22 was way over priced.  Also there was confusion with the waiter as to what else came with it. -  a small portion of bread or potatoes and beans?  When finished we asked for the desert menu and was told they had no deserts but we should look at the breakfast menu?
The menu is mostly interesting, but a lot of work needs to be done with the servers, the portions and total execution.  We hope they improve to the level of Cafe Ted and we will be regulars."}
{"text":"I treated myself to breakfast @ Emily's Cafe last week. Now the reason I say treated is because I shouldn't be eating out with my finances at this time, not because my experience was by any definition a \"treat\". The hostess and most staff were very polite, but I happened to get a server who's service and general disposition was less than satisfactory. It took her a while to acknowledge me after I had been seated and when she did make her way to my table, there was not a \"hello or \" how are you?\" or any other pleasantries as I would expect having been a server myself. I proceeded to say hello and ask her how she was and she already had her pad of paper out and dismissed my attempt at the normal small talk by saying \"fine, you ready to order?\" I went ahead and ordered and she brought my food maybe 15 minutes later, which consisted of french toast, biscuits and gravy and one scrambled egg, it was all cold. Before I made it even 1/4 of the way through she put the check on my table and that was the last of our interactions (if you can even call it that) as she never came back to ask how my food was or see if I needed anything else; I was hoping for a to-go box. You pay your check at the counter so I left my backpack and unfinished food/ drinks at the table. By bill was roughly $12 for cold food that I didnt even get to finish because when I walked back over my table had been cleaned and my leftovers were being carried back to the kitchen with dirty napkins on top so no way to salvage it. My coffee that had just been fresh topped (by 2 servers other than my own during my visit) was gone, along with my milk and ice water. I had planned to sit and do some browsing on social media while I finished my drinks. I tipped her almost 20% because it's just what I do but I'm kicking myself now for my bill with tip totalled $14.00 and I worked my butt off for that $14 and a I feel like it'd have been more satisfying to give the money to someone that needed it, because judging by her poor service, she certainly must not have. I don't think she earned a tip, whatsover. Because of her, my experience is @ 1star. Had I gotten a better service, had my food not have been cold and I had I been able to take my leftovers away (which I blame on my server), I'd rate it @ a 4. Unfortunate that one egg can ruin the whole bunch. I'm not in any hurry to try again."}
{"text":"Tried Emily's today.  I was reluctant after reading the reviews, but I always like to give places a try.  Place was dead at 10:00AM.  We were the only ones there.  I ordered the borderline omelette.  It was over cooked and brown on the outside from burning the eggs.  Hate that!  The English muffin was burnt .  The potatoes were cooked nicely, but too strong on Rosemary.  Rosemary is not well liked by many people.  I think I would do seasoned potatoes with peppers and onions instead.  My wife ordered the traditional breakfast.  It was ok.  Bacon was cheap greasy bacon.  For the prices they charge, one would expect Apple wood smoked bacon.  

Overall, the prices are way too high for what you get.  Service was good at first and then slow to get the check.  We won't return.  We have better breakfast choices near by.  Too bad.  I wish every business owner success.  This place won't last long."}
{"text":"The Worst Service Ever! Avoid this place .
Came with my family of 4 and waited in line for 30 min without being greeted or even acknowledged while waitresses passing by everyone with super grumpy faces . 3 other groups of people left  that were very displeased as well. 
I don't understand how place like this can operate and have any customer base .

Don't waste your time and go somewhere else !"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and delicious here. Small family run restaurant with gorgeous interiors. I've eaten there many times and highly recommend it to people who appreciate romantic interiors and best quality."}
{"text":"I had driven by several times and always wanted to try it. Even being during a Sunday brunch rush hour, we were able to get a table and be served quickly. I recommend sitting outside. There was plenty of shade and the morning breeze was wonderful. The food was yummy and they offered gluten free bread. Strongly recommend this place and would for sure go again."}
{"text":"Very lovely place!  My husband and I stopped in for the first time yesterday.  The server was very attentive, especially with the coffee which is important to my husband. He ordered the Farmers Market omelet which he enjoyed immensely.  I ordered the American breakfast which was very good.  The only thing I can suggest is that they use less rosemary in the potatoes...it was a little overpowering.  But I would not let this prevent us from coming back.  Their potatoes are much preferred over the mushy hash browns at the Breakfast Joynt down the street.  And there was no wait!  I see the negative comments....but being in Scottsdale and eating at many places, I recommend that you try this place yourself and form your own opinion.  I am picky and I will be back here....can't say that about the Joynt!  Trust me!"}
{"text":"I came here with my roommate around 8 in the morning. I got the party melt and it was pretty cheap. Amazingly cheap. It was a pretty sizable patty as well. It wasn't amazing but it did fill me up and I can't really complain. I came during a slow period so all you could hear we're the machines. Its located in a casino which I don't really like but there's nothing you can do about that. Service was good came and refilled my drink and they weren't mean or anything. The place looked really bland and again the casino noises was a big turnoff. However, I would recommend it if you don't mind it. Amazing price, big servings, friendly service, bad location."}
{"text":"Fairly new spot in N Scottsdale. We finally decided to give it a shot for breakfast. The place is adorable. Defiantly it's been decorated by a women. Semi country style. Each table is different from the next one. The Decor is very well put together. The place is spotless and staff super friendly & attentive. You can sit indoors or outdoors. The menu is unique which I love. I get tired of the same old breakfast stuff. My husbands and I ordered an omelette and French toast to split. Can't remember the name of the omelette but it had chorizo in it. The sauce on top of it was amazing. we would defiantly go back. Food and service was excellent. The only reason I did not give this place a 5 star is because I felt the music was way too loud at 9:00 am. I like my morning to be a bit more relaxed. Mostly on a Sunday. The music made it a bit hectic."}
{"text":"I am just not really a fan of this place in general, but I will try not to go too hard on them. I mean, it is what it is. The service is slow and I don't find the servers to be overly friendly either. I can't figure out how there is a wait to be seated, other than their \"specials\" and the local regulars who spend too much time in the casino and are probably comped. Sadly, I've eaten here more than once (I used to live acrossed the street). The last time I was in, I had a patty melt. I figured this should be pretty simple. Wrong! The patty itself had NO flavor and was so greasy that I used 5 napkins during my meal. The server never came to refill our drinks or bring ketchup, after numerous requests. After anytime I am in there, I promise myself I will not be back. I've given Emily's numerous trys and they always fail. I have never been in for breakfast - maybe that is what they are good at?"}
{"text":"Hidden in the deeper parts of Henderson you'll find this quiet cafe.

Looks are typical & nothing to brag about but the silent arena leaves room for great conversation. 

Perfect for a quick \"let's get something to eat, honey\" type date or ideal for a business person to type up some work duties.

Definitely a casual setting. Friendly staff & though the food wasn't to die for.. it was very delicious!!

I wouldn't mind coming back..

{"text":"My wife and I eat breakfast out every morning and we decided to try This place and was disappointed from the reception the moment we walked in.  The bacon omelette was terrible.  Potatoes were cold and tasteless.  Waitress was nice, but owner seemed mad when we walked in.  If your in this area I strongly recommend the Breakfast Joynt over this place."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here after a hike a Toms thumb.  The food was delicious!  Service was awesome.  It's peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. Well def be back again.  The southwest omelette was delish!"}
