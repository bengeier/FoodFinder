{"text":"mussels Ok, frites soggy and greasy.  Clearly part of tourist trap central.  Sangria was decent though, and the outside seating on a perfect afternoon helped."}
{"text":"We walked in this place without a reservation. We were with our friends and a total of five kids.  The ambiance was dark but we sat by the window and could observe onlookers in the street. I had the sampling of buffalo, Venison, and Deer. It was great and well prepared. Most importantly they were very accomodating to our children. I would recommend again."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. A bit pricey, but well worth it. A majority of the staff were bilingual, so communication was easy. Everyone was friendly, and stayed on task despite how busy it got. We were seated immediately by David, a very friendly and funny man. I'm unsure if he was the owner or just a host, but he was a pleasure.   The food was amazing. I got the seafood linguine and my boyfriend got the venison in red wine. We were both beyond impressed by our meals. We paired it with delicious and reasonably prices wine and beer. The place definitely had an authentic European feel. I highly recommend and will definitely go back next time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Food wasn't good. The wait time was insane, almost 2 hour's for nothing special. It was a mistake going there. Bill was $260 2x appetizers 2x main course and 2x drinks.   I'm glad there was more to enjoy in Canada then this place ."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our rounds around old Montreal, mostly because of a sign outside declaring a special with a dozen oysters.    First off, the wait staff wasn't the friendliest - not rude, but just a tad ... off.  Oh well, ultimately, not a deal breaker, maybe it was an off night.  The oysters and the wine (all we had) was excellent, except for one thing... they have an ONION sauce to dip?!?  As anyone that reads my reviews knows, this is usually a big negative for me.  Still, with my limited French, and their limited English, we were able to get a bottle of tabasco, so the night was saved.    The atmosphere here was a little old and dark, felt a little off for that reason, but maybe on a different night, this place might have a good romantic atmosphere.  The menu looked good, and peeking over at another table proved the dishes to be pleasing to the eye, but I can't judge on looks alone.  When I find myself out in Montreal again, I'll keep this place on my radar, ready to give it another go!"}
{"text":"With so many good restaurants in the area, we came here?  What a waste.  Save your money and sanity and go elsewhere.   Anywhere else.  Really.   I ordered a salmon and goat cheese salad and a beer after waiting 15 min for a server to show up.  The beer arrived 20 min later, all 8 ounces of it.  Then came a basket of pedestrian bread with pre-packaged butter and no silverware.  Finally my salad arrived (beer was long gone by then and no offer to replenish).  The salad had no goat cheese and only a few greens on a rectangular plate that was mostly empty except for a drizzle of olive oil, 7 capers,  and a ring of purple onion.  Skimpy portion of raw salmon was a little fishy.  I returned the plate and waited another 10 minutes for a proper presentation, this time with goat cheese and enough greens to obscure plate.  Never served water or another beer.  And again had to ask for silverware.  Comically bad service.  Other customers nearby were also visibly frustrated with slow service.  I decided against ordering an entree based on all of this -- and prices are not cheap.  At checkout I gave the server (a different server this time) my polite but candid opinion of the experience.  Received an apology but no offer to make amends of any kind.  Hence this brutal review.  This place is exploiting know-nothing tourists.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wandered into this restaurant on a dreary night during our visit to Montreal. There was only two other couples in the restaurant, so we experienced excellent and attentive service. We ordered the vegetable soup and the escargot as the appetizers, the cornish hen and duck confit as the mains. The food was superb - the cornish hen was one of the best dishes I've eaten at a restaurant all year, and my wife's duck was savory and flavorful.   The ambiance was very nice - dimly lit with soft music enveloping the background. The price was as you would expect for a nice restaurant in a tourist-centric area - approximately 25$ to 30$ for the two-course meal (appetizer + main)."}
{"text":"Not to bed for tourists old town.  Onion soup and oysters good , fougra is excellent. Comfortable atmosphere and very polite server ."}
{"text":"Had lunch in this restaurant.  Wild boar was excellently cooked and the flavor was great.  Companion's lamb was even better.  Not many patrons on a rainy day, and the service was excellent.  Recommend it when in Old Montreal for lunch."}
{"text":"The servers were not friendly and the food was not that special. We sat outside which provided us with a great view of the street to people watch"}
{"text":"This place made me feel like I was back in Europe, Portugal to be exact. Drank a bottle of vinho verde, and the soup was not that good. He tapas how ever were great and staff was very friendly, the young waitress was cool and worked very hard."}
{"text":"Je ne comprend pas les médiocres avis donnés.  On est arrêté dans ce petit resto hier et on a été agréablement surpris... Le décor de jette pas de mine mais on a eu un service irréprochable, et tout ce que nous avons commandé étaient délicieux et les prix respectables...."}
{"text":"Slow slow service and the staff was completely inattentive. This is an expensive tourist trap. Be warned. This is a cute little part of town but don't be fooled!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here on Labor Day. My wife and I were in the mood for a little more \"french\" fare so we tried this place. They just opened when we got there & got a table next to the window that opens up to Rue St.Paul so great for people watching! Our waitress spoke very good English & was very polite & smiled the whole time (I hate it when ppl look like they'd rather be elsewhere when serving you). Had the lamb shank w/ vegetables & soup & glass of red house wine plus 1/2 doz oysters as an app. My wife had the mussels & steak fries & sparkling water. Great food & atmosphere for less than $80US including tip!  If we're lucky enuff to come back I will certainly try the marinated wild boar!"}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour un party de Noël de bureau et quel désastre ce fut. Et le pire, c'est qu'on a osé nous demander de payer 20$ pour manger là-bas, alors que j'aurais eu un meilleur repas aux Trois brasseurs à côté. La viande avait l'air calciné, la bière avait dépassé sa date de péremption et le service était lamentable. Franchement désolant."}
{"text":"Actual visit on 9/5/14. Ordered Pates Vegetariennes farcies au Ricotta et Epinards - Veggie Rotolo - Pasta stuffed with ricotta and spinach. Salad.  The 2 ricotta and Spinach rolls were tasty.  The side salad was very good.  The highlight was the very flavorful Sangria.  Service was ok...... I had to ask for a water refill.  There are sooooooooo many other restaurants in this area, I would probably give another one a try before rushing back here."}
{"text":"Ambiance agréable et cadre charmant. Toutefois le Confit de canard était un peu sec et légumes manquant un peu de fraicheur (surgelés?)"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely phenomenal.  I had the Cornish hen and my friend ate the wild boar. Both dishes were thoughtfully prepared and the wild boar was especially flavorful.  Beautiful flavor in the sauce, and the Cornish hen had a bit of Portuguese flare. The owner was also very friendly. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  Lamb, venison and duck were a big hit for us.  Strawberry in port was superb dessert. Great atmosphere and charm for Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for what was provided.  Portions very small (4 scallops each half the size of a thimble, plus 4 grossly overcooked slices of chorizo sausage) was 16 bucks.  Overcooked bison was 35.  It wasn't terrible, but you can do a lot better.  Maybe it was just a bad night, but  the combination of being overpriced and overcooked made for an unpleasant dinner."}
{"text":"Not bad for an area filled with Tourist traps.  We wanted to enjoy Old Montreal one last night before we go and eat en plein-air.  Unfortunately, we were surprised to see majority of the restaurants along Place Jacques Cartier only served typical 'tourist' food (burgers, pizza, pasta). We were glad to see La Sauvagine's menu offering unique cuts of meat.  We had (3 adults/2 kids): - Trio of wild meat (elk, deer, buffalo) The meat were cooked to a perfect medium, unfortunately, I was soo hungry, I forgot to ask which meat was which, but they all tasted good! - Trio of duck (confit, filet, foie gras) The obvious stand out was the foie gras, but it was nice to try all 3. - Lamb shank perfectly cooked soft lamb - kid's - fetucinne alfredo - kid's - chicken strips with fries  My trio of wild game was delicious, but for $42 it was a bit small - about a 1.5 or 2 inch cube of each meat.  Service was friendly throughout the evening and helpful when we were deciding our orders.  We weren't even forced out when we were the last ones at the restaurant.  3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"FatCat learn new word today.  \"Tourist trap\".  This is when greedy business man taking advantage of unwary tourists who not know city well.  But you thinking \"hey FatCat, you so smart. How you fall into tourist trap?\". Yes yes.. FatCat know, but smart cats not immune to making bad decisions sometimes - that's how FatCat coming to this restaurant.   Things FatCat like - Nice big patio where FatCat relaxing his fuzzy tail.  Things FatCat not like - only one beer on tap.. Not bad beer but not like lack of choice. - FatCat first start drooling when he see description of strpiloin steak on menu, but Mr Owner of restaurant not honest with FatCat about what Mr Owner serving. No peppercorn sauce like promised. And instead of chomping down on juicy striploin, FatCat wrestling with gigantic piece of grissel with tiny bit of meat attached to it. FatCat asking server for chainsaw to cut through meat, but server ignoring FatCat's request. FatCat thinking that even waiter embarrassed about working at such bad restaurant.  Old Montreal disappointing FatCat.  Maybe he only eating in New Montreal from now on ? No, not fair to old Montreal just because of one bad experience. FatCat coming back again. Yesterday FatCat eat at good restaurant in new Montreal. Writing review soon.  GOOD NEWS/UPDATE: FatCat regaining confidence in all Montreal restaurants. See FatCat review for \"Dominion Square Tavern\"."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. They never offered us any water.  When ordering for food, they barely helped us out and were being snobby when they were describing the dishes.  After ordering, food took a long time to come.  The hostess came by and helped us take pictures while we waited for food. She was the only person that was nice and courteous at the restaurant. She's the only reason why the restaurant would get +1 star.  When the food came the waiter had no idea who to serve the dishes to.  After we finally got all the dishes on the table, the waiters never came by to ask how we were or asked if we needed anything else.    While we were there, the waiter brought over forks and dropped the fork; ok no big deal.  Soon after when they brought over the bread, again he dropped it, this time on one of my friend's lap. The waiter then asked, \"you don't want it? Since it only touched you, you don't want it?\" He takes the bread into the restaurant, comes back with a dish and a bread on it.  As he placed the dish on the table, he said \"I just put the same bread on a plate, you won't even know, and now you'll take it.\"  By the end of the night, we haven't thought much about the lack of attention the servers had shown, but it soon became really obvious that they had been neglecting our table.  As soon as we asked for the check, the waiter was hovering over our table while we were examining the check, the ENTIRE TIME.  When we finally decided how much tip to pay and placed the payment by the check, the waiter rushed over and picked up the cash right in front of us and counted the money in our face.  Never in our lives, have we ever seen such rude customer service provided.  To top off the terrible experience, their food was bland, tasteless, and extremely over priced for very little food on the plate.  A 6 oz steak 1 glass of wine, came out be around 50$ excluding tips.  Completely not worth it in any way shape or form."}
{"text":"The setting is lovely, and that's probably what the restaurant relies on. On a beautiful day there is barely any gap between people snagging the outside tables. Given that there was nobody inside, that should have been a sign. While the bread, salad and drinks came out in a timely fashion, we have never waited as long for our main course to arrive. From being seated in the sun when we sat down, the sun had literally moved to the opposite side of the street by the time our food arrived. When it did, it was fine - nothing to write home about, but clearly the overall experience was underwhelming enough to write this review! Go for the setting, and be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"I am going to give this 5 stars based on 1 thing and 1 thing alone. The venison.   We were walking in the area looking for a place to eat on the 30th of December, 2012. Place after place didn't seem to fit the bill and finally we found this place and gave it a shot. The wine was good, it was warm (it was cold outside), and it was a nice comfortable table at the window watching the night pass by. The ambiance was nice, the place seemed fine and dandy.   Andy got the duck. It was ok. I'm not here to talk about the duck.   I got the venison and it was the best deer meat I've ever had. Whoa, you might say. How much have I eaten venison? Well, despite growing up in New Jersey I have eaten deer meat in about 12 forms on hundreds, if not thousands, of occasions. Ground, diced, bologna, sausage, and on and on. Cut with pork, stewed, in chili, in a burger. We had so much deer meat that when I went to college I said that I would be happy to never eat deer again so long as I lived.   And in general, I agree with that statement to this day. However, if we ever go back to this place I will get the venison, and enjoy the succulent and rich dish that sat before me that night. I was simply blown away by how amazing it was. I have to be honest, part of me thinks that this wasn't actually deer meat. But hey, why advertise it as anything else? In the end, it was amazing, just amazing.   In the end we had a nice meal and a great evening. Was it worth the price? I have no idea. But if you find yourself here I highly encourage you to go here. Oh, I tink it was in a maple sugar-based sauce. It was good, damn good. If you go here, order it. And enjoy!  The wine list is impressive as well, IIRC.   PS. For the sake of fairness the duck gets a 3 at best. Maybe more like 2.5. Don't bother with the duck. The 4 letter word that begins with D that you seek is: DEER!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible (and awkward AF) service and sub-par food. I could write an essay on it but I don't want to waste any more time on this place. Avoid."}
{"text":"I'm only in Montreal for a few hours as I was on a business trip. I was walking around and decided to grab a bite to eat here. The service here is fantastic, they have a real sense of urgency. I got water, bread and my soup promptly. The vegetable soup was very decent, and the rolls are fresh and scrumptious. My moules frites were decent as well, I had never had them before so I have nothing to truly compare it to. Overall 4 stars!"}
{"text":"OMG, why did it take over 2 hours for dinner? The courses were small enough that they were finished in minutes, and then the wait time between each was up to 30 minutes. 2 out of 4 got their coffee after the main was finished, but the other 2 only got theirs after they had finished dessert and sat waiting. This is ridiculous for a restaurant not at full capacity. The waiters changed during the meal and they seemed rushed and confused. The QPR here is seriously lacking, and lets be real, the food was often over-salted and mediocre. Seriously. Canned chickpeas in a salad and 1.5 cherry tomatoes. I was so underwhelmed I would have left if it wasn't a meal with my boyfriend's family.   Here's a little info for business owners everywhere: a poorly kept bathroom is totally gross. No one wants to go somewhere where you'll end up paying at least $40 pp and then use a restroom missing door handle parts, toilet paper and paper towel on the floor, and seats that are almost hanging off.   Done, over, never again."}
{"text":"Le Sauvagine was only OK.  We were there for a special occasion while traveling. It had a very nice setting in old Montreal.  Quaint inside.  Service was spotty and the menu was OK.  Our main course was very good.  The soups were not as good.  Neither the Bisque nor French Onion had a great deal of taste.  This was quite surprising for a French Restaurant.  I'm sure there are better restaurant selections in old town."}
{"text":"I had a good, but not great meal here.  The \"menu gastronomique\" on this night consisted of three items: -A fantastic French Onion soup (but really, you better not screw this one up if you're a French restaurant), that was loaded with bubbly cheese and a rich broth. -A relatively bland portion of seared duck breast that looked a little bare on the plate and was a little dry for my taste.  Note: one of the other diners had the duck entree, which she was extremely enamored with -A tasty elk medallion, prepared au poivre, which was perfectly cooked but really did not pack the peppery punch I was expecting.  Fortunately the plate had enough other flavor on it to complement the meat well.  This included foie gras, as well as some roasted new potatoes and a vegetable medley which were both very nice.  I can't for the life of me remember the name of the bottle of wine we had, but I was fairly unimpressed with a boring cabernet that lacked any real flavor.  This was a $45 bottle at the restaurant that could not have fetched more than $10 at a grocery store.  I should mention here that when the check came, they billed the prix fixe as $52 instead of the $42 that was listed.  Keep your wits about you.  It was a good meal.  Given that French restaurants on this adorable cobbled section of Old Montreal are more densely packed than Montreal bars are with underage Americans, I will probably not be back to Le Sauvagine, even should I find myself back in this neck of the woods again.  But unless you have some insider info, this place'll do."}
{"text":"Unlike some other recent reviewers, we had good service.  It was the middle of the afternoon in a record setting heat wave and we really just stopped in for a drink at one of the outside tables.  But then we saw the frites, and then we ordered the moules et frites, and of course we needed two glasses of wine to wash it down.  C'est la vie.  The food and service were very good and there were little birds all around the table to pick up any crumbs we dropped.  With the tip, the total came to a little under $50 and it was just right.  Maybe if we were in a rush we would have wanted to see the check come a little quicker but it really wasn't a problem at all and I'd love to come back and explore the menu at some point in the future.  Interestingly, the receipt said \"Auberge Solmar Sauvagine.\"  Solmar is the restaurant next door and it seems that the two are connected."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one star and that's only because of the location.  The restaurant is situated in the Old Port of Montreal, on a beautiful cobblestone street, tons of charm...that's where the positive part of this review ends.  We were greeted as we entered the restaurant and were seated quickly.  However, it took almost 20 minutes to get a glass of water, another 25 minutes to get our beer, which we ordered once our water was delivered.  When our extremely stressed, profusely sweating and almost invisible waiter did finally bring us our beer, in bottles, he asked us if we wanted a glass and if we did that we could go ahead and use our wine glasses, which we weren't using.  About an hour after being seated, and 40 minutes after ordering our food, we still did not receive a morsel of food.  We noticed that the waiter had been bringing baskets of warm bread to the tables earlier, so I asked if it would be possible to get some bread while we waited for our food.  The waiter explained that 1) they were out of bread and were waiting for more to be delivered and 2) that even if they had bread that the oven was being used for something else and our bread would be cold.  He explained that we were \"first\" on his list for bread once they got more bread.  About 20 minutes later, he brought us bread...it was cold, along with the butter.  My friend decided to heat the butter by holding it over the candle flame, which could have worked brilliantly, only the plastic packaging began to melt, so cold butter is what we settled for.    Salad was included with my meal, but not my friend's, so he ordered a salad in addition to his meal.  The salads arrived about an hour after we placed our order (yes, AN HOUR FOR SALAD).    We did finally receive our food, I had ordered the salmon with shrimp sauce and my friend had ordered the whitefish.  The portion sizes were large enough, but my salmon was extremely fatty and the shrimp had not been deveined, and my friend's fish was riddled with bones, we counted at least 30 of them.   Both dishes were served with rice and overcooked vegetables (rappini and zuchini).  We asked our waiter to bring us some lemon wedges, but he forgot, so we asked the hostess and she went to the bar and got us some (of course this was almost 15 minutes after we had been served the fish).  The waiter did not once ask us how our meals were, nor did he ask us if we wanted another drink after we finished our beer.  We had to flag down the hostess for everything.    I'd like to point out that the restaurant was by no means busy, and we were not alone in our assessment.  We watched a table of 7 people gulp down their green soup, and then wait for well over an hour before receiving their mains, and only half the table got their mains, the rest had to wait an additional 10 minutes.    Our meals (salad and fish) along with 3 beers total over $85.  I have to say that paying that bill felt like wallet rape.  All in all, this place was a disaster and I would not return, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Although I didn't have any food here, the hour or two we spent sitting out here on a hot summer day was enough to deem this a good spot for people watching.  Entering the premise it was completely empty as everyone was outside having their drinks.  They have a decent selection of beers as well as a full selection of top shelf liquor and prices while a bit higher than most, is rather expected for this area of town.  The amount of people walking down the street both locals and tourists (mainly tourists) make for extreme entertainment.  Service staff were friendly enough and despite initially wanting to sit our sizable group separately, accommodated us when we moved our chairs together."}
{"text":"Sangria...vendu comme la meilleure en ville....eh bien laisser moi en douter et surtout à 28$ le pichet!  Je préfère aller prendre une bière juste à côté et je suis loin d'être une amateure de bière!!!! Calmar grillé...bof...10$ pour 1 seul calmar...prix du vieux-port!"}
{"text":"This was a quaint old-world feel French restaurant, that provided good food.  It was a very warm night, and the patio was full so we opted to sit inside.  It was slightly uncomfortable without an open window nearby, but the ambiance was very nice with the dim lights and the excellent music selection, a mix of French and English classics -- the bartender was mouthing the words of several songs, right along with the music. The waitstaff was excellent, friendly, good-natured, and polite.  As others have said, the soup was bland, but my companions seemed to love their salads.  The foie gras was small, but good.  The boar medallions were also good, with potatoes and asparagus, but they came in a very rich sauce that was a little overpowering, although tasty.  I drank a lot of water that night.  The highlight of the dinner was the desserts,  The crêpe á l'orange was excellent, and the cheesecake was very large and very rich, with a raspberry jam-like consistency topping.  Both wonderful.  Additionally, I heard great things about the flan and the almond roll, though both were very small.  All in all, it was a good experience, but with so many options for good French cuisine, I'm sure I will try another restaurant next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Should have been obvious. Dirty and old room, our server couldn't keep his fingers out of his mouth, biting his nails AS he served tables. Confit de Canard was pedestrian. Shameful."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant find as we had the opportunity to tastes wild game from the area.  The service was prompt and respectful and the food delicious.  We would definitely recommend \"La sauvagine\" to anyone visiting Montreàl."}
{"text":"If you have nothing to do all day and enjoy being ignored by the waiter when it comes time to pay, this is your place.  It's really a shame, because the rest of the staff were great, but the older waiter who took over was more concerned with chatting up another table of his buddies. I'm not sure if this is part of their \"French experience\", and if so, they need to drop it fast.   And yeah, it's right smack dab in the middle of Old Montreal (aka tourist trap)...and it's a nice spot to people watch..and the food was ok..but it's a nope for me."}
{"text":"I guess things have changed since the last review, or I just enjoyed myself here...    First, my family saw a bunch of locals smoking outside on the patio, so we figured that if locals were willing to hang out in the touristy section, then the food must be good...and we were right!  This is definitely a French-Provincial (countryside) type restaurant and not downtown Paris.  The meats are accented with herbs and more basic sauces (wine/herbs) that reflect the main course.  My family all ordered from the \"specials\" that come with a soup or salad.  The salad had a little bit of everything and the soup was cream vegetable (basically butternut squash soup). Both good, but we couldn't wait for our entrees: my brother and I both ordered the venison (Civet Gibier) - it was cooked to perfection! Fell apart with the fork and the red wine sauce paired perfectly (I also had a glass of tempranillo which complemented well). The lamb (Jarret Prov) was basic/Provencial - just rosemary and a little reduction, but you could really enjoy the shank of lamb (and a large shank it was!).   Confit de Canard was basically the same as all other restaurants, but it was a decent sized portion. (I've uploaded pictures of everything!) They all came with a side vegetable medley which we all enjoyed!!    Since we enjoyed dinner so much, we had to try dessert. This restaurant featured some really interesting fruit desserts I had never tried so I went for the poire au porto. DELICIOUS. I love cinnamon, wine and pears and this was a fun treat! Nothing like this in the states! yummm. My dad got the fraise au porto which was also pretty darn good. The port complemented the strawberries perfectly.  The crepe farcie tasted like a creamsicle.  Ambiance: French Provincial - very representative of early Canada with wood paneling, ceiling beams and medieval accents.  It's dark, but very hunter-lodge.   Service: I think the main waiter may be the owner? We were there on a Thursday night so it was basically a one man show where he was waiting on the majority of the tables. My family came to enjoy the town and try new foods, so slower service wasn't really a problem for us.  And we asked for more water once, and then never had to again - our water was filled to the brim right after taking a few sips!  Is it slower than an American chain restaurant? Yes. Was it so slow I was dying of hunger? No.  Food: A+ (I've never had veal like this before!) Ambience: B+ (a little dark, but kindof fun/Canadian themed) Service: B+ (A little lacking at first, but food/drinks came in a timely manner (taking into account that veal and duck can't just be thrown over a hot fire in order to be cooked the right way))  I'd GO BACK! :)"}
{"text":"This place is so bad I don't want to waste my life thinking about it anymore. So I'm not going to write in all the details. Just know the quality of food was substandard for the price, the portion sizes were laughable, and the service and wait time was as bad as I've seen in any restaurant.  It looks good from the outside but this restaurant does not have its act together.  Find an authentic upscale restaurant to spend your money in in Old Montreal. This one is a rip off."}
{"text":"Great, loved the wild boar and escargot. The beer was especially good, and the service was fluent in french, english, and manors."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch. We had the french onion soup (a must have), steak and frites, and the duck confit which was amazing. These were part of the lunch specials and made for a great inexpensive lunch.  The wine options were good too.  Perfect little restaurant in Old Montreal.   Giving it 3 stars as I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner due to service and wait times."}
{"text":"I don't understand all these one star reviews!  My husband and I ate here last night after we cancelled our reservation at a high end restaurant. We were in the mood for something less fussy - a good French bistro. La Sauvagine was exactly what we were looking for. The patio was great, the food was top notch (I had the salad and the scallops, hubs had escargots and venison), wine was delicious, service was good! We had a very enjoyable evening!  I'm glad I didn't whip out my phone and check reviews before we wandered in!"}
{"text":"Le service est lamentable le serveur était plus occupé à regarder les gens passer qu'a nous servir, j'ai commandé un verre de vin avant le repas et je l'ai eu j'avais la moitié de mon assiette de mangé... Rapport qualité/prix pas fort trop dispendieux pour la qualité des assiettes, il n'y a pas grand chose dans les assiettes, nous ne recommandons pas cette place il y a tellement d'autres bon restaurants tout près. À éviter à tout prix même pour un repas gratuit je n'irais plus à ce restaurant..."}
{"text":"Lunch just of the main tourist spots.  Quiet, shaded, Pablo had some moules et frites and I went mad for the oysters and bouillabaise, Washed it down with some cidre rose and a gin and tonic.  Well yes lunch was $100 but that was my doing.  Tasty and satisfactory portions. Service was A-OK"}
{"text":"Jacob was an attentive waiter. Recommending the perfect off the menu wine for my palette. We sat outside an the chef came to tell us which way the wind would blow and how the temperature might dip.  The wine was interesting, the Brazilian coffee tasty. Our bread choices were nice with butter or olive oil.  The wild game was spectacular. We had wild boar and the elk.  Dessert was delicious. We apple crumble. Not too sweet.  We have been here twice before. We strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Think I fell in love with this place before I even took a bite. A French restaurant with outdoor seating in the heart of Vieux Montreal, which I guess isn't that uncommon but the French Onion soup and Duck Entree was amazing. Three kinds of duck one amazingly large plate for $35 included foie gras, duck confit and medium rare grilled duck breast. The duck breast was spot on and they did not spare on the foie gras...there was a very healthy portion. I would definitely recommend to friends and will return if I ever find myself in MOntreal again."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this little French restaurant at the corner of St Paul and St Vincent in Old Montreal. We were visiting the old city and wanted to get a taste French cuisine before heading back to TO the next day.  While the prices were \"normal\" (as in moderately high) for French cuisine, I found the food quite good. I actually \"sampled\" everything that my family order and everyone had only good things to say about the food. I did't order any wine, so I can't make any comments on that. I had the veal, and I thought that is was cooked just right, and the sauce was fantastic. I even loved the roasted potatoes which they included as a side.  I wouldn't hesitate to make a return visit if I'm ever in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"My mother wanted a fancier place to celebrate her birthday, and her being French, she wanted a taste of the Motherland, in other words, lots of meat!! The place was deserted when we went (earlier this year) and we chose our seats. Now maybe they size them for the europeans, but we felt quite cramped! The decor is lovely, I love the slightly antiqued feel and the massive Old-Port stones. The menu is a nightmare for vegetarians, you've all been warned! They specialized in finer, rarer (more expensive) meat, generally game: dear, boar, moose, geese and the like. I remember ordering sausages and not being terribly impressed. My parents were delighted with their choices tough. I find the portions inversely proportional to the price, which is a crying shame.  The real highlight if the meal was the desert: I was almost ordered by my parents to take a creme brulée (which I don't usually care for). Now this is the real deal: so rich, so creamy and flavorful..  Just a note on the service: I am by no means a child, but I felt rather ignored by our waiter. They probably have an eye for the customer with the wallet.."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a whim. Mistake. 25 minutes between appetizer and main course. No explanation. No apology. Food was good, but not worth that kind of wait!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service you can find in old Montreal. They keep you waiting and they were so rude from the get go. We asked if they had hot sauce and the tall waiter snarked back.  The food had not even arrived and they were truly dismissive and rude. Then we simply asked them if we could change tables because it was so sunny in the patio, and The food was taking forever! The waiter was visibly annoyed and when we asked him if moving presented such a problem, he responded that yes, it was a problem... keep away from this place."}
{"text":"Definitely wish I had read the reviews pior.  The summation is that this place is definitely a tourist trap.  The service for my family was fine but there were only two other occupied tables.  The steak I ordered was chewy and no one in my family finished the subpar food.  The one good thing? The bottle of Merlot.  Definitely on a whole no where close to worth the price."}
{"text":"LOL! I should probably be upset that I just spent $100 on the most mediocre meals ever, but it's so hilariously bad that I still left smiling.   We went in here with zero expectation, and boy did this place ever deliver! First off, the waitress didn't even understand the word \"pétillant\" in French or \"sparkling\" in English... not sure how else I'm supposed to communicate in Montreal. The inside was an absolute travesty - decor from a dilapidated French bistro and waterlogged bathrooms.   Now, on to the food. The snails tasted like they oozed out of a can. The lamb shank was dry and covered in what I'm guessing was St. Hubert prepackaged gravy? In a word or two, the food here tasted like resentment and sorrow.   When the bill was delivered it, they had \"accidentally\" charged us for two other tables' bills and seemed upset when we asked them to fix it. I had to hold my tongue when they asked how everything was, but thankfully for Yelp, I get to vent."}
{"text":"Back again for dinner and overall a smash.  Game pate, soft not deep flavors Shrimp bisque a hit with 3 others, did not have The Bison was killer, the Elk the same and my friends were right, pass on the Venison. Next time I will. The poached pear in port was delicious.   The Cahor and the Chardonay were both open, present and balanced.  A huge departure from the more famous Napolean place which leads me to believe that the owners of Sauvagine took the time to taste the wines they bought.  Clearly huge value for the money.  In all a delicious meal with excellent service.  Eat inside where it's adult.  Leave the outside dining for the beautiful people."}
{"text":"Not too shabby, however, the service was quite slow, for such a busy area. The food was also just average, and the lobster, well, for the price the portion was tiny. While there are a few good items on the menu, it certainly is more of a tourist trap. Just an average place with average food and service, overpriced."}
{"text":"Just stopped for coffee, iced tea, and sorbet. I understand why the ratings are mediocre. Despite their excellent location (or maybe due to it), they appear to think they don't need to extend to the customer the bare minimum level of courteous service. No refills offered, and we had to ask for napkins. The less appealing restaurant next door was full."}
