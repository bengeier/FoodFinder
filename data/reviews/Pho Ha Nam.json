{"text":"I used to have a Vietnamese roommate who cooked pho for me. I love it and use that as a standard for all phos I try out in restaurant. The pho I ordered here looked authentic, but tasted less so. It tastes like some key ingredients were not added enough. In general my experience was ok. It is a clean and quiet place. The veges are fresh."}
{"text":"The best pho and Vietnamese food in cleveland in my opinion. Good portion, taste, service. Price is cheap. Location is convenient, there is plenty of free parking. Plus we can go grocery shopping at asian supermarket next door after meal."}
{"text":"Overall not a bad experience staff was friendly and quick 
The pho was average. 
The meat was tough and rubbery not a huge disappointment but just not the quality I'm used to and I have eaten pho from many different restaurants ranging from Wa,De,Az, & Pa."}
{"text":"This pho spot is in line w/ the other quality pho restaurants in Asia Town (Superior and #1 Pho).  I had the Pork sandwich and bowl of pho.  Very good meal w/ lower prices than the previously mentioned places.  Post meal walk through the next door Asian market is a huge plus for unique food options."}
{"text":"Just rolled into town and remembered that Cleveland has a strong Vietnamese community and pick this place to find out.

It was just a funny experience (the food was very good). It was pouring rain and the yelp directions emptied me into a parking lot of a Korean Restaurant? I wound up calling the place three times trying to understand where in heck I was trying to go?

Twenty minutes later my son arrived in at Pho Ha Nam and here is the deal, it is INSIDE THE ASIAN FOOD MARKET and THERE IS NO SIGN OUTSIDE!. That is all I wanted to say really. The place is perfect whole in the wall and the food was quite good and authentic. If I am ever back in Cleveland I will be sure to look them up."}
{"text":"We met family there as we were passing through Cleveland, based on yelp we decided to eat there we ordered almost everything on the menu, the waiter didn't get our orders right my pho was good but there was barely any meat beef over cooked and barely any tripe, the fish sauce wasn't great, and the sandwiches was served cold I can go on with my family's orders the waiter seemed overwhelmed, I would not eat there again."}
{"text":"So I went to check this place out with my wife yesterday.  I was excited to try it because we were quite fond of the other pho place that was here.  Coming in, we saw that it was packed with what appeared to be Vietnamese people, which is usually a good sign in an ethnic restaurant.  After a couple minutes of the waiter cleaning off our table (which was a little strange because he had been eating his lunch at a table off to the side- friend, if there are tables that need cleaning in a full restaurant, get those tables clean before sitting down to feed yourself), we were seated.  Without any menus.  OK.  So, after a few minutes, we went ahead and asked for some menus and they gave them to us.  Food took a long time to get to our table, especially for an Asian restaurant.  Or maybe it seemed that way because we were starving.  Also they didn't give us any water- we had to ask for it.  So it seems that the service could use some help here.  It was bad, even for an Asian restaurant, which I'm not going to lie- I have lower standards for Asian restaurant. You are generally there for the food, not for the service!

We ordered Summer Roll (better than average), Banh Mi (definitely better than average), a bowl of pho with the 4 cuts of meat in it and the Bun Bo Hue, which was the main reason that I wanted to check the place out.  I'll cut to the chase, we were both disappointed by the bowls of soup that we got.  They were more expensive than the average price around here, seemed to be a regular to smaller sized portion and really didn't taste that great.  The pho had a mild taste for it, which is somewhat strange to me- I'm used to being smacked in the face by a clean, strong beefy flavor.  This one tasted kind of mild and a little bit oily, which is really strange to say about a bowl of pho.  I was surprised that they don't offer tendon, but they offer tripe instead.  I'm surprised that the average customer orders tripe before ordering tendon, but maybe that is just me.  The Bun Bo Hue was ok- not too strongly flavored, a little bit oily, but that is understandable.  Noodles were decent.  Not very spicey.  I really like the spicy beef noodles at Siam Cafe better.  And the beef noodle soup at Phusion Cafe much better- and that is almost $2.50 cheaper.

Ultimately, it was a bit of a disappointing experience.  If I go back, it will be for the tasty Banh Mi which is a good deal at $5.  Definitely better than the ones you get in the grocery store- they did a great job with the grilled pork.  I'd probably get some vermicelli rice dish with the grilled pork in the future and hold off on the soups unless there was a change in recipe.  Hopefully this restaurant gets its act together- I would definitely appreciate having another choice in the vietnamese restaurants in CLE."}
{"text":"Best pho in Cleveland! I know a good pho when I see One.  Very nice ppl! Family owned. Would recommend and come back again! If U like banh mi. This is also a place to get! The Pho is better than most pho restaurant around the area!"}
{"text":"The bun bo hue is great full of flavor and pork meats and herbs. Not sure about the other reviewers previous but I ordered the pho a few days ago and it literally was the pho is the best I've had in Cleveland in the last 3 years I've been here (pho dac diet had every cut there, tripe, meatballs brisket). Great side of herbs to go with it all.  This restaurant is where I go when I am homesick for my mom's vietnamese cooking!"}
{"text":"Super impressed with this new restaurant in the Asian Town Center complex. Ordered take out on a Monday - when my go-to Vietnamese take out restaurant Minh Ahn was closed. Love love loved the pho (P3), bun with pork (N2), and summer roll (A1). The pho was presented with the noodles in a separate container from the thinly sliced beef and the baggie of the bean sprouts, jalape√±o, and basil, so that I could assemble them all in a bowl when I got home and enjoy the perfectly warmed beef slices in the delicate broth. The peanut sauce that accompanied the summer roll was insanely good. But the highlight of the entire meal was the fresh mint, which really made the flavors in each of the dishes pop. Seriously, I can't say enough about the freshness of the flavors. Pick up time was very speedy (15 minutes). Can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"Still love this place!! Was so sad to hear it was changing ownership but came in and saw my favorite lady there still which was awesome!! I loved the food before but it's actually even better now, especially the com tam. Only thing I was disappointed with was that they took hu tieu off the menu. That was my favorite thing to order before."}
{"text":"Had a craving for pho, so I decided to grab some at a new place. So glad I did! The service was nice, and the food was delicious and plentiful. I don't know what it was about this place, but I had an overhwlming sense of cleanliness, warmth and comfort, as well as a general feeling of well-being. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I felt as if I was eating a meal at someone's home half way across the world. Perhaps it's some really good feng shui goin' on. Anyway, I will totally be back to snag me some pho when coming here to shop next door."}
{"text":"Just popped in to do some shopping at the market and decided to try some place new. So incredibly impressed! Great food, great service and great ambiance. Couldn't ask for a better experience!"}
{"text":"Best family restaurant!! Love the services here!! The owners come out to ask you how is the food and what they can do to improve!!! And they actually listened to your opinion!!!! 
We always have pho, bun thit nuong, and you can't forget their famous band mi!!!! All that goes along with an amazing Vietnamese coffee and it has completed your meal!!!! 

Currently under new management!!! Since beginning of 2017!!!!
This is easily hands down the best pho restaurant in Cleveland Ohio!!!! You won't be disappointed!! Take my advice!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I spent a month on a medical school rotation in this neighborhood-- a part of town I probably never would have found myself in otherwise. It turns out to be an interesting place, home to some great food places, including Pho Ha Nam.

It's located on the first floor of Asia Town Center, which doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that scare you. This little restaurant is a great spot for lunch! Both the #1 (eye round) and #3 (eye round and flank) are excellent. If you're not in the mood for pho, I can also vouch for the summer rolls, which have shrimp and pork and come with a yummy peanut sauce. Pho is under $9 for a gigantic serving-- I could barely eat half-- and the appetizer options are under $5, so this is a budget friendly lunch. Not a ton going for ambiance, but it's clean, and the employees are very nice.

Good pho is hard to find-- it's worth an adventure to this strange little mall to try this out."}
{"text":"I was sad to learn that Ninh Kieu was changing ownership, as I found their bun bo hue to be the best in the city. My sadness quickly disappeared when I tried Pho Ha Nam for the first time, shortly after the ownership change. The same friendly lady was at the counter, the atmosphere was the same, but the menu had changed. No matter, I came for the bun bo hue, and that is exactly what I ordered. Now, for the best part: as soon as I ordered, I was asked if I wanted pork leg in my soup. What!? Yes!!! Of course I do! My bowl came out shortly thereafter, with the plate of garnishes. The plate consisted of limes, chopped lettuce, banana blossoms (yes!) and chopped mint. But wait, what was that weird leaf mixed in? Fish mint? Why yes, it was. Bun bo hue, with pork hock and more herbs than just mint and basil? Is this Vietnam, or Cleveland? As I dug into my bowl and savored the depth of flavor, spicy, earthy, citrusy; the waitress came around with small plates of sate sauce, asking the diners if they would like to have some to spice up their dishes. I love sate, chilies, lemongrass, garlic, and I think I detected shrimp paste too, or at least fish sauce. The complexity of the soup reached yet another level, as did the spice (whoever says Vietnamese isn't spicy just doesn't know what proper bun bo hue is). 

What a way to make an impression! Best bun bo hue I've had. Great service too, as not only did the waitress periodically check on me (she remembered me from the Ninh Kieu days), but a lady from the kitchen also came out to talk to guests. 

I have since gone back to order bun bo hue again. This time I was with my family, who are not nearly as in love with Vietnamese food as I am. They both loved it, especially my mom. She ordered the bun nem nuong, and the waiter and my family all shared a laugh when mom couldn't quite figure out the correct pronunciation. This time I was not asked for the pork hock, and did not have the fish mint with my garnishes, but no matter, it was delicious. I'm sure if I asked I could have had both. The third time I went I ordered pho tai nam (eye round and flank). The broth was very flavorful, it wasn't light and mild like some broths. They also give you the standard pho garnish plate, but instead of cilantro you get culantro, even better! It may be worth noting that the flank steak is fatty, slightly chewy, and definitely not what some casual diners may be expecting. That just makes it even better I think! 

I love Pho Ha Nam, and I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"What is Yelp really pho? It's pho discovering hidden gems and hole in walls, and then telling everyone about them. To help them stay in business. To help all of us eat more deliciously, and eat more locally. And it's to help you find the very best in any given town that you visit.

So here we have another example, hidden away in Cleveland.

Pho Ha Nam is a nice little place with cheap and enjoyable Banh Mi sandwiches. They are just about worth of 5 stars, it's somewhere between 4 or 5, but I edge it towards 5 because of how friendly they are, and what a hidden gem this is. 

I would recommend you try them if you love Vietnamese sandwiches. I haven't tried the soups but then neither has your girlfriend (she told me last night)."}
{"text":"This is the best Oho I have had in Ohio. The service is fantastic. They had old Godzilla movies in TV when I came in. If you come here the Pho place is in the big building. Give it a try."}
{"text":"No frills place with a simple menu, but consistently excellent taste. Would recommend any of the pho options, the Beef Bun Hue, Bahn Mi, and the B√∫n Tht Nng. Their grilled, marinated meat dishes are especially good."}
{"text":"Having lived in San Francisco for many years, and experiencing authentic Vietnamese cuisine in several restaurants there, PHO HA NAM is now the best authentic Vietnamese restaurant in NE Ohio.

Their Pho is outstanding - fresh, flavorful, and generous portions. Their summer rolls are perfecto - always made fresh with the peanut sauce consistently thick and tasty. Their Vietnamese sandwich - Banh Mi - is large and awesome. The family staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean! And regarding price = very very affordable.

Compared to the popular and to me, vastly over-rated Superior Pho on Superior, PHO HA NAM is the more authentic and quality focused Vietnamese restaurant in NE Ohio. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!

{"text":"I really enjoyed the bahn mi, summer roll and vermicelli salad w pork.  The meat was seasoned perfectly.  The group all enjoyed their meal! They don't service broths besides beef so thats one negative but otherwise very pleased w this place.  Note they close at 8pm."}
{"text":"Awesome pho and all round Vietnamese.  Fabulous Bahn Mi.  Great prices and a cool location.  Picking up a sack of sandwiches for parties is the way to go."}
{"text":"This was a great find. We were in the mood for pho on a cold rainy night and decided to try it out. There was only one other group in the restaurant when we got there which made me nervous but I shouldn't have been! I got pho with beef broth and tofu even though it wasn't on the menu, also a veggie summer roll (also not on the menu). My friends got pho, self-wrap summer rolls and pork with vermicelli. Everything was fresh, and made to order. This restaurant is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This place makes one of my favorite Banh Mi Thit Nuongs. It's almost perfect, almost. I got it to go and the service was friendly and super fast.

Now why is it almost perfect? Because the pork is perfectly cooked/grilled and it was beautifully marinaded. But also, there's a lot of it, like A LOT. That's why it's almost perfect, it would be a 10 out of 10 if it had more veggies and they were pickled. There were a few carrots and some cucumbers and jalapenos. But the carrots weren't picked and there was little to no daikon. It's a toss up though because there's that much pork and it's just that good. But I missed the vinegar taste to balance the pork...

If you took the pork from this place and put it together with the veggies of the same sandwich from Pho Tang Cafe on Superior, that Banh Mi Thit Nuong would be completely perfect. But if you're sane and you know, aren't going to do that - I still highly recommend the Banh Mi Thit Nuong from here. Plus it's only $5 and there's a very good chance you won't be hungry after."}
{"text":"We had bun bo hue, goi cuon, pho, and com suon. Omg!!! The food is soo authentic!!! It's like what my mom would make!!! I love it so much that I togo some goi cuon. Soo delicious!!!! 
A hidden gem in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"Went here based on some other yelp reviews - it is \"ok\" in my book.  The place is located in the Asian Food Co market building - which is an experience on its own.  The restaurant is clean, with the typical Asian Market smells wafting through the building.  I ordered the Pho Tai and a Classic Bahn Mi - I found the soup to be rather bland, and required a fair bit of hoisin and Saracha and salt to get up to something that resembled a classic Pho.   The Bahn Mo was very good.

Sometimes you have to try new places - I think there are a few other places that are much better - and there are plenty of options to try in the general area."}
{"text":"I guess this place has new ownership now and you can definitely tell by the menu. I only ordered the Pho but it was quite disappointing. The place looks exactly the same. This is the first time my Pho ever came out quick as one would expect but it wasn't great. The noodles were a bit too soft as mentioned in another review. The pho itself was very plain Jane and it's probably the first time I've been disappointed paying for Pho at a Viet restaurant."}
{"text":"They serve the best bowl of Pho in Cleveland- the broth is the most nuanced in flavor and the portion of meat is very generous. I enjoy the other places in town, but I think this friendly spot is the best. Bonus: abundant parking in the shopping center."}
{"text":"Came here with a reservation for a group of 16 for late lunch on Sunday. A very casual place, good Vietnamese food. I got the Meal 2 with Bahn Mi and Pho 3. The Bahn Mi was actually very meaty compared to most I've had and has a slight ginger taste. Pho was solid, good serving sizes. Servers seemed quite busy but were pretty attentive and service was pretty good. Would come again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden pho gem in Cleveland.  Ha Nam replaced a prior pho restaurant in the same location.   The interior is the same but the menu is revamped.  I've tried pho from the Vietnamese food Mecca of Houston, Texas and I give Ha Nam pho bo (beef pho) two thumbs up for flavor. 

They're closed at 8 pm on Friday so if you're looking to come for dinner make sure you give yourself plenty of time.  My only gripe is the cost.  5 dollars for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) and 8-9 dollars noodle soup is quite steep compared to Vietnamese restaurants in other Vietnamese-centric cities.  

Here's our menu line-up: 

1.  Banh Mi Thit Nuong (Vietnamese BBQ Pork) 5 dollars -   The BBQ pork is the bomb!  The lemongrass seasoning was flavorful.  The french bread was warm and soft.   The chef accidentally over toasted our french bread so it's charred black.  The french bread is what makes a Vietnamese sandwich so good.  Instead of making us another one,  the server gave us burnt bread and asked if it's alright.  We were the only customer in the store at the time.  If you want guests to come back, don't be stingy on the quality of your food. 

2.  Bun Thit Nuong (BBQ pork vermicilli) - 8.50 excellent dish.  The star of the show again is their BBQ pork.  definitely a must try.  You won't be disappointed. 

3.  Beef pho with brisket and meatballs - 9.00  the broth is on point!  It's flavorful and the star anise season really comes out in the broth.  For pho experts, star anise is definitely a must in the foundation of pho broth base.  The noodles was good as well.  The excellent flavor is dampened a bit by the overly oily broth.  The fatty oily just coats your palate.  

Here's the synopsis:  definitely a must try pho location in Cleveland.  The food tastes authentic with some hiccups here and there, but I will return"}
{"text":"This place produces one of the best bowls of Pho and sandwiches in Cleveland. Terribly underrated, and to not visit this place is a disservice to your palate."}
{"text":"Good food, on par. This review sat in my draft box by mistake :) Anyhow.. Had the bahn mi and pho combo last week which was a good sampling of their menu. They allowed me to substitute the lean cut for my preferred cut of brisket, which was nice of them but I wish the brisket was more tender. The tripe, which was the other protein, could've been cut a bit wider. Bahn mi was quite good, the bread was great in texture! A touch more pickled radish and cilantro and it would have been perfect. Goi coun (fresh rolls) was on par, and doesn't need radish on top of it's condiment (peanut-hoisin sauce). I would've preferred that they just added crushed peanuts only. The server was a young man who spoke limited English but was very polite. Thanks for helping me find this place Yelpers! I was in a bind for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Having just moved to Cleveland from Los Angeles, the biggest issue for me is finding good asian food. And let me say that this place definitely compares to back home! Their banh mi is one of the best I've ever had, even compared to the many I've tried back in LA. The spicy noodle soup is also delicious, plus you can get a taste of both with the set meal. All in all, one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great Bun BO Hue for the Cleveland area ! It was so great to have a big bowl of steaming hot, delicious Bun Bo Hue when the weather was like 10 degree outside ! 
The service was great, the owner was very friendly, the place was very clean and charming. I also bought some Pho and Banh Mi Thit for my son who was at Cleveland Clinic. My son loved both the food."}
{"text":"Solid addition to the Vietnamese restaurant scene in Midtown! 
Personally, I never cared for Ninh Kieu, I found their Bun Bo Hue to be too far too salty, I even suspect they used MSG in it. However, when the restaurant changed owners, I jetted over to see how Pho Ha Nam stacked up. 
For those that loved Ninh Kieu, you'll be happy to know not a whole lot has changed. The inside is largely the same, and a lot of the servers are still there. Their menu is a bit different however, it's definitely pared down, and prices are comparable to others in the area. The service was very fast and friendly. I was pleased to find I actually liked their Bun Bo Hue even more than Superior Pho's; while Superior uses a LOT of lemongrass in their bun bo, Pho Ha Nam's is definitely more spicy and oily, which is great if that's what you're after. They also add some variety with shredded radish and pate in the bun bo, which doesn't often come complimentary. My only criticisms are that there was a greater proportion of noodles to meat, which I personally don't mind, but others might feel the meat portion was a little small. I found with the addition of the pate though, it was a well balanced bowl. Unfortunately, they did not have tendon (my favorite noodle bowl add on) but otherwise I really enjoyed my meal here. My iced tea was complimentary, so I ended up walking out spending less than $10 (not including tip) for a very satisfying meal. I'm looking forward to trying more from this location, and I would definitely return next time I'm in the mood for some spicy Bun Bo!"}
