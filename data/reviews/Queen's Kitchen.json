{"text":"I come here several times a week. From what I've experienced, it's the best value stall in the mall especially if you have their VIP card if you come frequently enough.   I usually get and highly recommend their fried chicken but the rest of the menu has generally proven consistently good. The young lady that works the cash has always a smile and is pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is 6 pieces for $8.50. They only had 5 thighs and 1 drumstick in the window, so that's what I ended up getting. Hurray for that! I prefer thighs to drumsticks. Usually, there's more meat on thighs. The one drumstick though, was pretty big. The chicken was crispy, savory, tender and juicy. Unfortunately, because these aren't made to order, they were cold by the time I got home. They also pack them in a paper bag, then put the paper bag into a plastic bag. They neglected to put forks or serviettes in the bag. All in all though, fairly good chicken. I'm happy."}
{"text":"I've been having takeout from this fast food place ever since I was a kid. I'd consider it a gem because it's one of the cheap yet decent Chinese takeout places around the city. I suppose a reason my parents kept going back is because it is tax-free and they have a 10% discount card. We usually get the dinner sets of three dishes, sometimes four. There is apparently a 1 hour maximum seating time in the foodcourt but meh, who even listens?"}
