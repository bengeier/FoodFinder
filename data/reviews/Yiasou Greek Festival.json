{"text":"As usual it's that time of year for the Greek festival. I only did drive they this time because it was pouring rain. Food heat as usual. Look forward to the festival every year."}
{"text":"This review will only touch on the drive-through food service, because that's all we made it to this year. They've really got this down to a science. We pulled in line behind a few cars and studied the menu (there were several large posterboard menus which had been attached to trees/poles down the street.) A volunteer came up to the car window and took our order, two gyros and a Greek salad. It was hard to wait until we got home (barely 5 minutes away) to unwrap the gyros, the aroma of meat, garlic and seasonings immediately filled the car.   The gyros were fantastic, and the Greek salad was large and included generous amounts of pepperoncinis and huge chunks of feta cheese. We were full until well past our normal dinner time.  I was surprised to find that the prices were the same as inside the festival, even though we didn't have to pay the $3 admission fee."}
{"text":"It's a church festival.  You know, the ones you went to while growing up?  This one's fairly sizable and they serve some tasty treats.  There's not much to write home about, but it's a fun time.  Who doesn't like a gyro from time to time?  There's a small variety of foods to try, but it's catering to alot of people, so don't get your hopes up too high.  The music and dancing make for some nice entertainment while the kids hit up the rides and mom and dad rest their weary bones by sitting at one of the surrounding tables.  Before you decide to make this an all day event, find your closest light rail station.  Parking is pretty scarce and there will be plenty of vehicles fighting for it.  Try:  Making this a two hour trip...it's more than enough time.  Avoid:  Ordering a hot dog at a Greek festival if you're not a kid (C'mon people!!)"}
{"text":"Have been going to the Greek Festival since I moved to Charlotte.  It is a fun day especially if you like to eat.  But every year the prices for the food have kept creeping up very high for a lot less food.  Don't think I will be going again.  Their lunch/dinner plate offered a lot more of a variety of the taste of Greece.  Now you get one stuffed grape leaf, a small spanikopita, a small feta cheese phyllo dough pastry, a small salad and your meat of choice for $12-$16. .  No pastichio as it use to be and small meat ball.  Their pastry prices have gone up.  Expect to spend at least 40.00 just to eat per person.   Don't mind paying more but at least give me the same amount of food they offered in the past."}
{"text":"I was a little underwhelmed by this experience. The food was good - I had a chicken gyro. But it was doused in taziki sauce. The dancing was fun and upbeat. The shops were just okay.. some had unique Greek items. Others were just homemade miscellaneous things.  I did go to a Greek wine tasting that was fun! It was $6 and you got to try 5 different wines - 2 whites, 2 reds, 1 dessert wine. We love the first 4, but the dessert wine was god awful haha. It was hard to hear the man telling us about each wine so they had an info sheet about it all."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of the month of September and never have been. It's still hot out with a hint of cool in the air and not quite fall yet. However, one thing that makes me look forward to September is the Greek Festival. It's only $2 admission, they have great food with lines that move fast (they also have wine and beer-along with Greek beer and American), tours of the church, entertainment such as traditional Greek dancing along with little stands of jewelry, art and little trinkets.   If you don't feel like going in, you can drive up and get a meat-o-licious gyro to go or other goodies such as baklava, spanokopita and more. This is easily accessible from the light rail but no parking so you either can light rail, walk or find off street parking in Dilworth. All in all, I wouldn't miss Greek Fest for the world. I may even go twice this yr!"}
{"text":"AMAZING baklava sundae!!! A must!!   We had so much fun walking around and seeing the vendors and fun food.   They have rides for little kids and I had a really cool dude draw a caricature of me. A little kid said to me as the guy was drawing, he made my teeth really big, I'd have to agree, but fun none the less."}
{"text":"Advice...do not go on \"school field trip day\"...ha! It gets a little crazy. First visit to the festival. Admission is only $2. All cash there, but the ATM's were everywhere if you need them. Great music playing in the tents and it seemed very well organized. Went for lunch to grab a gyro and boy was it good. Large enough to not need more than one, and the Greek fries on the side were seasoned very well. Made the \"gyro/fry\" order a success! Drank it all down with a big lemonade. Needed some treats after to hit up the baklava, which was sweeter than I remember, but very tasty in a limited portion. A great festival that I will continue to show up at every year going forward...just not when 10 school buses are lined up outside :)"}
{"text":"The Yiasou Greek Festival occurs annually around Labor Day.  It's held Thursday - Sunday.  Admission is only a couple of dollars and it's fun for the whole family or couples or groups of friends.    Once you're in there, you can eat, drink, and be merry!  There are many options for dining (fast food or sitdown), desserts, shopping, rides for kids, entertainment, music, etc.    We go every year because I crave the gyros and baklava.  I've tried both at different restaurants and festivals and nobody makes them better than the Yiasou Greek Festival in Charlotte.  That's not all they serve...but I'm always immediately drawn toward those two items.  There are many greek dishes available, though, and oh-so-many tasty pastries!    After you've stuffed your face, you can wander through the shopping areas to purchase Greek foods to take home, jewelry, crafts, art, etc.  Then grab a Greek beer and watch the entertainment.  After this time has passed, your stomach should have settled some and you can go eat some more!  :-)  If you can't stand crowds (and it IS crowded every day of the festival) or can't find a place to park on the street, you can swing by their drive-thru, order your food, and bring it home to have your own Greek Fest...er, Feast!"}
{"text":"This festival's food isn't nearly as good as in years past. The platters served inside have been cheapened over the past few years. Platters used to include pasticcio (spelling?) a delicious greek cassarole. Now it must be purchased as a separate item. The bread served used to be delicious...this year I got a cold commercial cheap roll. Don't get the fish can be \"fishy\". The last straw was the baklava I purchased had rancid nuts.  Although we've attended this festival for many years, we won't be back next year. Sad."}
{"text":"This is a great people-watching trip if nothing else. The selection of activities is not so fantastic, however. The festival is jam packed, tons of kids running by and into you, and not much to do but eat. So I wander, munch on some deserts, watch a bit of dancing, sit in the church and enjoy the stained glass murals, I bought a coin skirt once, and then I'm out. the most enjoyable part for me was being on the outside of the fence with a gyro from the drive-through stand. I did notice there are children's rides and face painting. I'm beginning to think this is a family-only festival as it's pretty mundane for the rest of us."}
{"text":"I used to live close enough to be able to walk over but I'll still try to make it in 2010.  The food is awesome, well worth the wait in the long lines.  People are very friendly and this is a great event for kids since they  have all kinds of activities outside for them.  Great for couples too!  If you like gyros and a funky orb like version of funnel cake, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We had a great time here, definitely looking forward to going again next year.  Tons of food, beer, and trinkets to buy.  Listened to the historical presentation at the church next door, as well as some of the dancing/musical entertainment.  There's something for everyone here, young and old alike.  Extra Kudos for setting up a DRIVE-THRU.  Brilliant!  Parking was easy.  My only real feedback is that I find it difficult to believe there is only one brand of beer in Greece?"}
{"text":"Very disappointed this year (2014). Both fish dinners had strong fish. Unlike in the past cheap salad dressing used (Ken's). Another major disappointment was that the pistachio Greek casserole was NOT included in the meals this year. All this with an increased admission price to $3 per person. My family won't be back next year!  Karl M."}
{"text":"I'm sure the shows, dancing, sales booths, etc. are great, but I'll be honest, I'm only here for the food. There are so many tasty options it's hard not to gorge yourself. I got a gyro, some of those little doughnuts, and a helping of baklava that's the size of a small pony.  All of the food is absolutely delicious and definitely worth fighting the traffic and crowds of people. You just might want to bring some mints with you to combat the killer breath after eating this food. I'll be sure to come back every year."}
{"text":"I don't have a soft spot in my heart for festivals, but I'll make an exception for Yiasou Greek Festival.  For a mere $2 admission, you have access to several dances, lectures and  on Greek history, culture, and religion, and displays on all things Greek.  The food is quite amazing and the vendors stalls sell everything from Orthodox crosses to swords.  I tried the gyro and baklava sundae...SCORE!  The gyro was packed with meat and fresh, tangy tziki sauce.  The baklava sundae is three scoops (maybe more) of vanilla ice cream with baklava crumbled on top!  If you want  real Greek meal, they have serve a literal platter of food in the church's community center-lamb, chicken, Greek lasagna,and  salad.  There's also a tent behind the church that just sells Greek desserts,  whoa!  I had visions of sugar plums dancing in sync to Greek music that night.   I'm amazed at the time spent organizing this festival.  There are numerous people staffing the information booths and explaining the displays on Greek history, like the Greek and Persian War. Don't worry, they play the movie \"300\" in the background and have little toy soldiers to re-enact the battles for you non-history buffs.  The church is an exotically beautiful Byzantine structure that makes the perfect setting for such a festival.  If you live in the Charlotte area, you must go at least once in your life.   TIPS:  Bring cash (the ATM's charge a $3 surcharge) and ride with a group of people to conserve the limited parking.  Be prepared to walk a good distance to the entrance."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday at 1. There were two lines to get into the festival with at least 100 people each. I had read the event was free but you had to stand in line to get a ticket. Parking was difficult so I rode my bike. Luckily there is a to go/ drive thru area for people who don't want to go inside. I did this and ordered a chicken pita and it was the most amazing pita I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Plenty of things to do for the kids, however, adults beware. If the reason you are attending the festival is to enjoy Authentic Greek food, you are much better off at the local greek restaurant. This is festival \"Bizarre\" food at best. Take the kids, enjoy the festivities and have a good time."}
{"text":"So this joint was a few weeks ago but I figure my review is still valid.   Next year, if you're thinking about attending and you don't have any kids; here are a few reasons you may want to attend:  1. Cheap date. 2. Nothing else going on outside on a beautiful sunny day. 3. Feel like spending money on something other than an in-door activity.   It was a gorgeous day but honestly after eating subpar Greek food and buying a recipe book (which was the highlight of my visit) my man and I mostly sat OUTSIDE the festival to watch the cars go by.   I'm sorry but after eating Greek Fiesta (visit Raleigh/Durham area), it's not on the same level.   Wasn't much for adults to do. Just a whole bunch of kids running around. The performances were aight and at times the service was \"Mer\" with a side of confusion.   Perhaps by next years event, I'll have a kid to take with me. It'll make more sense."}
{"text":"I was definitely impressed with the Yiasou Greek Festival 2009! They organized this event very well and had a variety of things to do and eat for everyone. The festival was held from Thursday to Sunday and it seemed like they brought the entire city together.  Parking is difficult, but they did a good job incorporating police officers directing traffic. It was really busy when I was there on Friday night, but I heard that it was not as congested during the afternoon. If you are not a fan of large crowds, but still want to go, pick an earlier time.   I was impressed with how many stages they had to show a variety of dances. There was one on the front lawn, back lawn, and one in a building. Like I mentioned, they planned and organized very well. In addition to spreading out the entertainment, they also put the food, shops, and rides in different areas as well (this way it helps to make every inch of their property filled with people). They had raffles, lectures, and educational rooms.  They only take cash, but they had 2 ATMS on their property to help you out. It's easy on the wallet and brings everyone together! If you missed it this year, plan to go next year."}
{"text":"Every September the ambrosial aromas of roasted lamb, spanakopita, and baklava waft through Dilworth, drawing Greeks and barbarians alike to Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church like some irresistible siren song. So dig out those old Edith Hamilton books, pop in that Yanni \"Live at the Acropolis\" CD (don't act like you don't own it!) and get ready for the Hellenic awesomeness that is the Yiasou Greek Festival!  This festival may be more or less the same every year, but as the ancient Greeks used to say (in their equivalent to \"honey badger don't give a sh*t\"), \"Hippocleides doesn't care\". It's always a great day out. And how can you really get bored with something that only comes around once a year anyway? The food is delicious and reasonably priced. They have live Greek music and dance going pretty much non-stop. There are rides for the kids and cultural exhibits and documentaries for adults. In recent years they've even had Classics professors from UNCC and Davidson College giving mini lectures on the Battles of Marathon, Thermopylae, Athenian democracy, Doric/Corinthian/Ionian architecture, etc. And if the heat gets to be too much you can find refuge from Helios' rage in the cool, dimly lit but beautiful cathedral.  I do have a couple pieces of advice though .  1. The festival is wildly popular. As such, parking is a nightmare. If at all possible, utilize public transportation. The rather indecisively named East/West Blvd Station on LYNX Blue line is only about half a mile (or 10 minutes walk) away with sidewalks the whole way.  2. You will likely hear loads of people raving about the baklava sundaes. In my opinion, the addition of ice cream to baklava serves only to diminish the pleasures of both. It's just too sweet. Instead, order the baklava plain and enjoy it with an iced frappé and stave off the beetus for another year.  Yiamas!"}
{"text":"First timer to the Greek Festival this year and I am so glad I went!  Be warned, this place is PACKED.  But it is so worth it.  The food is amazing, the atmosphere is lively, and there is plenty of people watching to do as you stuff your face with the most delicious gyro and Greek fries you've ever tasted.  Also, for those dessert lovers out there -- there is a desert BUFFET (to put it in over-sized American terms) where you can literally just walk down this beautiful line of Greek desserts and pick the ones you would like.  It's about $2 a dessert.  I split three with a friend and we barely made a dent. And the best dessert of all?  My friend and I were walking through the festival having a nice conversation when she slaps my arm (hard) and says, \"Shut your pie-hole!  Does that say Baklava Sundae?!\"  Needless to say, you should probably try one of those.  Another added bonus is the jewelry.  Beautiful gold, turquoise, silver and much much more.  I wish I would've came more prepared because I would've walked out of there with a new jewelry collection!  Lovely stuff.  Overall A+ here.  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"The Greek Festival doesn't change much from year to year.  It's a well organized festival that includes Greek food served indoors in a large dining room or outside at booths behind one of the buildings (which is a little difficult to find).  There are a lot of desserts outside but they are not covered so you have to be careful with those.  We found the same desserts boxed up in a room inside next to the main dining hall so that was a little more convenient.  They have some vendors inside and outside.  Not all of the vendors are Greek-themed but that's okay.  The basement of one of the buildings had historical lectures about the Orthodox Church and Greek culture.  The church itself is beautiful and they have free lectures every hour.  This is a nice event but it is definitely the same thing every year.  I believe I first went to it 10 years ago and the festival is exactly the same.  The parking is tough especially during peak times.  If you just want food, they have a drive thru on Winthrop Ave but note that during lunch time there were at least 15cars in line for it.  If you haven't been to the Greek Festival, I'd say go.  If you have been to it, it is the same festival, so I would not make it a necessity to return."}
{"text":"I don't know why but I just don't think the Greek fest is that awesome. I'm not that much of a fan of Greek food so maybe that's the case because after filling up and walking around for a lookeroo I'm kind of bored.  Yeah there's dancing and culture and all that, but anthropology never interested me that much anyways. I'd much rather have something fun to do or get involved in while almost everything at the festival involves waiting in line for food or looking at something.  At least I can usually get in for free. The food is nice and the people are friendly, which I think they'd have to be to be able to stand all that crowdedness in the area. Can you just do like a drive through window during the regular year and I can get some Greek food to go when I'm feeling lazy though? Cause it really sucks to brave the traffic/crowded train and pay admission to go buy some food."}
{"text":"Yeah I'm a fan.  Been too long since I have gone to the Greek Festival in Dilworth but that is my loss.  Was originally going to go on Thursday night but we had torrential downpours in the area.  Went this afternoon (Sunday) and the weather could not have been nicer.  Clear skies, light breeze and temperatures in the 70's.  It was crowded as ususal so we ended up parking four blocks away and walking.  It was a pleasant walk and gave us a chance to see they old houses of Dilworth that were being renovated.  The festival was fantastic.  Several stages with dance exhibitions, great Greek Food and you could eat in or they had outside tables where you could also eat.  One high point was the fact that the priests gave lectures on the Cathedral, it's art and the significance of that art and differences between Eastern Orthodox vs Western or Roman Catholic practices.  The Cathedral is one of the most beautiful houses of worship in the Charlotte area and well worth taking the weekly tour at 3 pm on Saturday the rest of the year.  As I said, been a number of years since I have been but will be back next year."}
{"text":"I have been in Charlotte for 20 years and have been coming here almost as long.  I love the frappe's, the wine tasting, the people watching, the gyros and the music.  You can't miss this festival, although I never win the Greek Trip drawing, bummer!"}
{"text":"First time at the Greek Festival even though I am a Charlotte native and very aware of the festival every year. It was a great Saturday afternoon with friends. The weather was perfect in Charlotte so Im sure that's why traffic was very heavy, even though the festival draws big crowds every year.  We luckily found parking on the street right off of East Blvd on one of the side streets and only had to walk about 4 blocks up the festival. The real traffic was trying to figure out if you were in the right line to purchase a ticket or to enter the festival for advance ticket holders. Luckily we found the right line and even though it was fairly long it moved quickly due to the cash only admission.  Once we entered the festival we headed straight to the food because it was around lunch. The lines were long but organized and clearly labeled with the food options available in the corresponding line. There were about 5 or 6 lines for pitas and fries, a line or 2 for salad and pizza. Drinks were a separate line. So it seemed liked we were in a maze of lines for awhile but the lines honestly moved fairly quickly and the volunteers were extremely nice. Finding a table to sit at was another task but people already sitting were nice and allowed others to sit at there table if there were extra chairs.  The food was pretty good being that they are cooking for such large crowds in an outdoor kitchen. I ordered a chicken pita and fries. The tzatziki sauce was the best I've ever had! Which made my pita taste even better, the bread was just a little dry and crumbly to me. The potatoes were good as well!. The baklava sundae was the only item I really was waiting for and it did not disappoint! It was so good and the portion was big enough to share with someone else.   While eating baklava sundaes we walked around to look at all the exhibits and vendors. A lot of great jewelry and homemade products. The children dance performances were really good and it was a lot of crafts available for children and adults to do. We did not get a chance to do the church tour and lecture, the next time was a little longer than we wanted to wait but I think its a must do.  The Greek Festival is definitely a Charlotte Fall must-do event, at least once!"}
{"text":"When an event is crowded I take it as a sign of success, but when it's *congested* like this one was I see it as a sign of negligent management -or worse greed. The solution is as simple as selling a limited number of tickets ahead of time, obviously the organizers are not interested in that, instead they boast of attendances of 40 and 50 thousands for the event. That's just crazy.    Unfortunately Charlotteans must be really starved for street festivals since they oblige year in and year out. I don't know, I'd get if this was a free Rolling Stones concert or another once in a lifetime event ... but for Greek folk dancing, gyros and stuff?   Since it's a community event rather than a purely commercial venture I gave it an extra star."}
{"text":"OPA!!!!!!!!!! Ha, man I had a great time at this festival in 08'. It was so darn hot outside, but we still found a way to have a blast! They drinks to serve and great food! The people were extremely friendly; its small but very good. Parking may be a bit difficult, but you just have to be patient. Go to the 09' Fest; I'll be there~"}
{"text":"What happens when a big, fat Greek festival hits the Queen city? lots of vehicular and foot traffic bringing Southerners in to get a taste of of gyros and baklava! OPA!  My friend and I decided to go on Sunday, the last day of the festival, thanks in part to the insanely gorgeous weather. Since my friend parked at the south blvd station and took the shuttle to the festival, they gave her free tickets! I made the mistake of driving (during peak times, don't even bother trying to find a lot closer unless you know someone who knows someone) and had to park my car in the south end, right on camden road and walk (which I didn't mind thanks to the weather).   Once we arrived, we browsed the vendor booths which had an array of jewelry, scarves, clothing, and various Greek trinkets. We then hightailed it to the gyros booth because we were both starving. Thankfully, the lines were short. I got the chicken gyro and greek fries ($6 and $4, respectively) and we both grabbed bottles of greek beer ($5/pop). Honestly, the greek beer didn't have a distinctly different taste, rather it didn't have much of a taste.  Unfortunately, by the time we browsed the booths and ate, the baklava booth had sold out. major sads. Reason enough to come back next year!"}
{"text":"OPA!! This was my first time attending the Yiasou Greek Festival and I was not disappointed. It was everything I expected from a great Greek fest - Authentic Greek cuisine, cultural exhibits, dancing, music, art, and shopping. KC & I went on Saturday around 7 and BOY was it packed!  The space was small and there were a lot of people and things packed in. It was difficult to navigate the tight pathways due to the crowds. Just be patient. Lots of people were loitering in the walkways making traffic move slowly.  The food was really the highlight for me. We got the baked chicken platter, which for $11, was a great deal. It came with a quarter chicken, triangle of spanikopita, greek salad, dolmade, pastisto, a piece of bread, and your choice of tea or coffee. I got white meat but they do not ask if you want dark or white meat. I bet you can request either if you have a preference. It was a TON of food. Everything was excellent. We also ordered a gyro. So good!  For dessert, we bought an assortment of pastries and a baklava sundae. The baklava sundae wss worth the price of admission alone. Enough to send you into diabetic coma. Three generous scoops of ice cream topped with a scoop of baklava bits. Amazing.  A few things I learned for next year...  Divide and conquer - There are a lot of different spots that serve food. There were different menus offered inside and outside. I wanted a platter and KC wanted a gyro so we got my platter and then found out we had to wait in a different line outside for the gyro. When you are outside, look for the signs on the tent that tell you what is served in that line. I also wanted a to try a feta pie but I found out that we would have to wait in a different line for that. You can't get anything else. The lines for food were really long but they moved quickly. Next year we will split up get our respective food choices and meet back up to enjoy them!  Cash is king - There were food lines that accepted credit/debit but they were not well labeled. Definitely bring cash. It would suck to wait in a long line and find out they don't take cash. There were a few ATMs around but I'm sure the fees were exorbitant.  Parking sucks - We found parking a few blocks over in the neighborhood. I would recommend taking the light rail or, at the very least, carpooling with friends. They offer a parking shuttle but you'll have to wait. Oh and avoid driving on East Blvd at all costs. The traffic is awful.   Go early - The food was crave-worthy and I wanted to reprise the meal on Sunday after a long day of watching football. I decided to try out the drive-thru dining option that the festival offered. I patiently waited in a long line of cars to turn onto Worthington. When I did, I was disappointed to see that most of the food was crossed off the list. I was able to order a gyro and a piece of spanikopita but all the pastries were sold out. Until next year...   Fun fact: yiasou is the Greek word for hello, goodbye, and cheers."}
{"text":"I go every year and am NEVER disappointed!!  This year I took the lightrail down and walked the few blocks to the festival - definitely easier than trying to park!  There is plenty to do for the kiddos - cute rides (yes they look safe and new!), bouncy houses, cotton candy and popcorn.  The dancing is non-stop and adorable as the Greek kids shuffle around.  I always for for the Mythos (beer) and a gyro and cookies.  This year we also got Greek pizza and plain pizza for the kiddo.  YUM!!!  Now I am getting this every year too.  The food lines get long so divide and conquer, one person grabs seats, another grabs beer (bring one ID up per beer you want!) and one person grabs the gyros.  Try to go at off times since it does get very packed.  Awesome way to spend an afternoon!!  Can't wait till next year!!  :-D"}
{"text":"We didn't have time to go to the Greek festival and went thru the drive thru on Saturday. I wanted a Greek salad, it was gross! They use Ken's dressing. It just had no flavor!! Panera bread has an amazing Greek salad! The baklava was yummy!! Husband got a gyro and he said it was amazing!! We will go back next year and skip the salad!!"}
{"text":"This was my first year visiting the Greek Festival after hearing about it for years I never had the oppurtunity to actually partake.  It was my 6 y/o and my girlfriend and I must say I enjoyed it immensly!  Plenty and I mean plenty of food choices, too many to even begin to try and remember but that combined with the entertainment in terms of dancing and the kids rides really creates a nice little outing.  I was very impressed with the events ability to cater to such a large crowd so quickly.  Yes, the lines get long for the food/drinks but they churn the people in and out pretty well in my opinion.    One suggestion I would have is get there during the week or early in the day.  Avoid the crowds because it does get slammed."}
{"text":"First year we have been .. Really enjoyed it ... Was super busy the food lines were long but fast and not over priced at all.. Could have had a better flow of traffic for people once inside as people were kind of all over the place.  But over all a nice fun day !"}
{"text":"This is the first time I went to this festival,  and I heard all about it from friends so I knew I had to check it out.  It was pretty cool.  We went on Friday evening and it was packed.  My Fiancée and I both got the chicken pita and it was delicious,  the sauce was incredible.  We also ended up buying a bottle of wine be aude it was so much cheaper than the actual drinks they were selling.  The Greek beer was not so great,  it tasted like cheap beer and it was $5 for it.  But the shows and the whole festival was pretty cool.  We would def come back again,  it was a fun event."}
{"text":"Easily the best thing about this festival is the food! You can get some really authentic Greek food here and it tastes delicious. Chicken or lamb pitas, gyros, Greek fries, tzatziki sauce, baklava sundaes. I literally come here just for the food.  On my last visit I got the chicken pita. It's excellent. Loaded with meat, tomatoes, onions and sauce that will undoubtedly cover your hands by the time you're done. Try to find a table because you're gonna need it. And make sure you grab more than one napkin. You may even want to snag a fork. The Greek fries are perfectly seasoned enough but taste even better dipped in the cool tzatziki. We finished off our meal with a baklava sundae. Baklava by itself is just too sweet and the addition of ice cream seriously balances out the flavor. You can also grab a few Greek beers at the festival.  The lines get crowded so plan to get food quickly or plan to spend a lot of time waiting. The tables also get packed and you may find yourself sitting on the curb. Inside the central building is a TON more food and tables. Come hungry is the point. Under various tents you can watch kids and teens dance around in a huge circle. It's a dance that, honestly, looks like the same thing all night long just performed to a different song. There's a huge community here and it seems like a very family-focused function.  There are also places you can buy some clothes, jewelry, packaged foods to take home and prepare and general Greek novelty items like a sign that has Athens written in Greek and English alphabets. If you brought the kids, there are some basic carnival rides too. Some folks will give talks on Greek history and we sat in one for the first time. It was actually quite interesting though lightly attended. The festival in whole though is heavily attended and really could benefit greatly if they held it twice a year instead of once. Opa!"}
{"text":"I have to say that it's been something like 10 years since I have actually been inside the gates of the Greek Festival.  Which is okay.  Even at the low, low bargain price of only $2, I don't feel like I'm missing much.  Sure, there is culture and there are rides (though I probably can't fit on any of them), but mostly there are lines.  Lines to get into one room and lines to get to the food and lines to get in in the first place.  But mostly there are lines just to get there because you have to park so far away.  So now I just use the drive-through.  Yes, you can get that lovely food to go by simply going through a drive-through, much like any other fast-food place (except the food is probably better).  You do have to deal with traffic, but take a right on Winthrop (I think it's Winthrop).  Give them your order, pay and you're done.  Even better is that they don't sell everything (such as the Greek donuts - or Loukoumades as Eric says), but they will actually let you park and run in the back entrance and pick them up and take them with you.  Simple awesomeness."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time and it did not disappoint! We parked on the street and paid for our ticket. We waited about 10 mins in line so it wasn't bad. We ordered our food and we were lucky enough to find a place to sit and eat under the tent. They had music and dancing as well. After we ate we went inside and shopped a little. The whole experience was informative and fun! I would defnitely come back next year!"}
{"text":"The event was okay. I can't say I'm dying to go again, nor would I say it was horrible. I love that Charlotte is big and cohesive enough to even have these cultural events. I know that they'll just get better and better every year. While it's a lot smaller than I'm used to and the food left a lot to be desired, I'm grateful that it's here at all. It's a good and inexpensive event to go to if you're looking for something new to do.   Cons:  -Small space, a little too crowded on weekends. -Line for the church was so much that we ended up just leaving. -Lines for food were kind of absurd. Go line up before you're hungry; by the time you get to the front, it'll be just right. I started out hungry, ended up famished and devoured my subpar gyro in under 3 minutes. -Subpar food. Gyro was meh. I was so looking forward to one of my favorite desserts: the galactoburek, but it was subpar. All of the desserts were insanely sweet. I've never had such diabetes-inducing baklava. -Agora had items that were either extremely overpriced or really tourist-chintzy.  Pros: -There's interesting stuff inside the building. You really can learn a good deal about Greek history. For this alone, I'd not only go again, but I'd recommend it to friends. -Atmosphere was great. People clearly take a lot of pride in this event. The music and dancing in traditional garb was actually really fun and livened everything up. -People-watching, of course.  -Wine-tasting booth. I can't say the wine was to my taste, but now I can say I've tried Greek wine!"}
{"text":"I thought Thursday afternoon would be a convenient, less crazed time to hit up this fabulous festival...and it was...until the school field trip buses showed up.  Regardless of the copious amounts of baklava/sugar-ridden children running around their harried field trip leaders, this fest is a must in Charlotte. The food is outstanding...yes outstanding. I ADORE a fabulous gyro and Yaisou delivers. Quick tip - there is a car line to the west of the church (fest) for to-go orders. I stumbled on to this after we left the fest - this is so clutch for next year. Not that I don't enjoy walking around the fest, but when it's insanely hot and there are tons of sweaty people eating stacks of meat and sugary baklava sundaes, sometimes to-go might be a more delicious option.  $2 gets you in...and if you have a friend in the surrounding Dilworth neighborhoods (who are absolutely affected by and consequently and potentially irritated by the traffic surrounding their homes) they typically get a handful of \"I'm sorry\" tickets for free entry into the fest. Free admission for a fabulous meal, FTW!"}
{"text":"They know how to put on a greekfest here!  The food is awesome, but so are the lines-be prepared to wait-but it is worth it. More than just great food: Greek dancing preformed Church tour Art booths game booths kids rides lectures"}
{"text":"Ya got your huge, eclectic crowds. Stage happenings audible throughout the block-wide party area. Random Made in China wares for sale at many-a-booth, some, smartly, with their tags cut out. Huge lines for food. Beer, albeit pricey. All the makings of a decent street fest.  What made Yiasou step over the line to Awesomefestville for moi: really, really good food, starting with the Baklava sundae and moving on down the line to Spanikopita better than any I've made (plus WOW those pastries held heat, 20 minutes after I buy the thing it's still trying to char my tongue). Slugging back multiple Mythos, a-leaning against a hallowed church stoop was hilarious and surprisingly comfy. Old school signage made me get out my camera early-on in the evening.  Parking can be rough. Totally worth the hassle. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fall means festivals and this one ranks among the best! Gyros and baklava??? What more could you ask for?  This festival is truly a celebration of all that is Greek. The warm, friendly greeting as you entire the festival make you feel so welcome. I've watched the festival being set up for nearly a month. So much planning must go into this event. Well-organized, the process seems seamless to an outsider.   You enter the festival on East Blvd. Bring cash! Tickets are $3 and they only accept cash for them. Once you enter, you can enjoy festival-like activities for families. You can choose to dine inside the church or under the huge tent set up with tables and chairs outside. To the left, you'll find pastries. From baklava to diples, you can find it here. It's like Christmas.  Turn the corner to the right and you'll find the food. I love the Greeks because you get to desserts first. Brilliant. Good choices range from gyros to Greek pizza and definitely Greek fries. You can pay for your food and pastries with a card but not your drinks. That messed me up because I wasn't informed of that when I called ahead. The festival happens at just the right time of year when outdoor eating is perfect.   Definitely a must-do if you live here or happen to be in the Charlotte area this weekend."}
{"text":"Having lived in Dilworth for over 10 years, I look forward to the annual Greek Festival.. Tonight I was able to make it to the drive through service, which allows you to get a taste of everything.  I ordered the Baked Chicken dinner & the Assorted Desserts.  The baked chicken entree comes with a variety of Greek treats, including a salad, pastitsio, grape leaves. The baked chicken is too die for, loved it.  The desserts were so good.  Something for everyone to try."}
{"text":"Hooray!  Probably one of my Charlotte \"Top 10\" things to do in the city, the Yiasou Greek Festival always promises a good time of food, dance, music, merriment, and all things Greek.  I think it is so great the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral opens its doors to the public to share its tradition and culture.  I am mostly attracted to all the food and eating activities, but there are many other activities for the whole family to enjoy.  First off, the admission is only $3 and kids 12 and under are free!  There is plenty to do and see once you get in.  The Evzones re-enact the Changing of the Guards around 3 & 7pm every day of the festival.  I was lucky enough to catch it yesterday while I was there stuffing my face with pastries.  There is live music and dance with multiple stages where the youth from the church perform traditional village dances in traditional costumes.  Usually I kick myself because the last couple of years I have gone, it has been rather late, everything has been broken down for the day and feels like a tornado hit the church with all the debris and merriment that people before me got to enjoy.  This year I went on opening day and it was great!  No lines to wait in... they are super organized this year as far as lines and signage.  Before you just got in line and hoping it was the right one!  I enjoyed my chicken pita, Greek fries, and Mythos beer.  Ended my day (and probably shortened my life a little) with some baklava ice cream.  A huge serving of baklava (minus the pastry part) over 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream.  So delicious and sweet.  Then my friend had too many Loukoumades [they are very generous with the number you get], so I had one of those as well.  The new thing I got to see this year were the indoor exhibits and gift shops, very cool stuff available to shop and browse through:  jewelry, art, and lots of gift items.  The only tricky thing about this event is the parking.  I usually try to scope out some side street parking in the neighboring streets, but it looks like everyone does the same thing.  There is a lot to park in at the corner of East and Scott Ave (across from 131 Main) and there is a shuttle that will take you .75 miles to the festival as well."}
{"text":"Everyone else seems to love this festival but to me it's just an average festival that gets too crowded for the space it is held on.  This festival mostly consists of food with a small mix of entertainment (a lot of dancing), a few rides for the kids, and a few vendors selling everything from grocery type foods to clothing.    The food that I've had here was decent and the greek donuts are wonderful.  If the festival were a little more spread out, maybe I would enjoy it more.  The good thing about this is I live close so I can walk to the festival instead of driving all around Dilworth trying to find a parking space."}
