{"text":"Is always one of my favorites.  As far as pizza in the city of pittsburgh not many come close.
I always enjoy my experiences. All around one of the best mom&pop shops in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and very nice people!  Glad I ordered from them! Will be returning. I also had the steak hoagie, was delicious!"}
{"text":"I loved this place when I lived in Pittsburgh. Fast delivery and cash-only means the price is right. 

Pizza was always a cheesy, greasy pile of delicious. Calzones were stuffed with yummy things. Hoagies were absolutely decadent. 

Oh, I miss this place."}
{"text":"Solid old-school pizza.  Plenty of cheese, good sauce and a nice hand with the toppings.  Sauce doesn't have that cooked-down flavor and is pretty bright.  Good dough with a nice airy crust with a slight crisp, but a good chew.  Hoagies are solid as well - we had an Italian- ham, cap, salami and provolone.  Crusty/chewy sub roll (Breadworks?  Mancini's? Whatever - it's a good roll.  We had their $18 special - large 16\" cheese (we added X-cheese and sausage for $3), whole Italian hoagie, and 2-liter pop.  $22 with tax and the extra toppings.  Better quality than Rialto.  On par with Big Jim's. Good value and really friendly owners.  Cash only."}
{"text":"This is a total no-frills, no gimmicks, greasy pizza shop. We like the hand tossed crust and  basic tomato sauce. They are always friendly and have my order ready for pickup in 15 minutes. I hope they stay in business as long as I live in Greenfield!"}
{"text":"The pizza bagels are the best. Everything is good but you have to try the bagels with extra cheese. Get a sausage and a pepperoni bagel and try each."}
{"text":"When I come to Greenfield, Conicella's the the best place to eat, it would be nice if they took credit cards for customer convenience but l am sure they will catch up to modern times. They have the best steak hoagies though."}
{"text":"I crave Conicella's.  It's a little hole-in-the-wall place, and there's not much of a menu, but oh man, the pizza is just terrific.  Tons of cheese, a fair amount of grease (hey, I never said I was a health nut), spicy pepperoni, delicious sauce and even decent crust, which I never seem to be able to find anywhere.  A large pizza will run you about $10 and will feed three hungry people.  Delivery is lightning-fast, or you can stop in and grab your pie.  There's nowhere to sit, and I'm not sure whether they take credit cards, but the pizza is totally worth a trip to the ATM across the street in any case."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza here a couple days ago, our first day in Pittsburgh, when all of our cookware was packed in boxes on a moving truck! We were not disappointed & would order here again. We ordered a large pizza with three toppings and an antipasto salad, and it was about 20 bucks. 

Pros: Good tasting pizza - very friendly service - salad was very fresh and a good portion for only $4.50

Cons: Delivery took about 50 minutes (although it was Saturday night), very little sauce on the pizza - I would prefer a little more. The crust is pretty flavorless, but the rest of the pizza was delicious. 

They told me I would get a free 2-liter with my order, and when they arrived the driver said he accidentally gave it to someone else - but I could just ask for it with my next order. Then he offered to help us move our furniture the next day! Really nice people!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! From the generous toppings and tasty cheese all the way to the bottom of the wonderful crust, this is some of the best pizza I have ever tasted. Try it for yourself- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"With no menu to be found online we took a gamble and called in an order for a large sausage and mushroom pizza and a chef salad. 

I went to pick it up so I could check the place out and it was just a solid little pizza place(no seating) with friendly people. The pizza was very good, I highly recommend the sausage. The salad was not exceptional but solid. 

Total bill came out to $17 even and with a free 2liter of coke. It's a great alternative to the delicious but pricey Murray Ave pizza shops."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the great reviews of the pizza. The one time I got pizza here, it was  . . . pizza. Kind of bland, kind of greasy, not any better than any other pizza I've had in my life! We did get the white pizza -- maybe that was the problem?

The calzones, on the other hand, are AMAZING. Delicious perfection. Nice and greasy and with a good fillings-to-crust ratio (I don't like a lot of crust!). 

The place itself has a cool hole-in-the-wall kind of vibe. There's nowhere to sit inside, but they do deliver. Oh, and they're cash only, but there's an ATM across the street."}
{"text":"Great pizza & hoagies! Good cooks & prices. You can get a beer at the bar across the street while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"Some of the best tasting pizza I have found in Pittsburgh so far that delivers also. I think the secret is in their crust. I was ordering from Rialtos for a long time until I found out about conicellas. Every since than I only order pizza from conicellas. They offer very reasonable prices and great customer service. They only accept cash. There product is worth every bit of it. Thanks Conicella for great products. Keep up the good work! Don't stop making pizza!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Greenfield from northern California, and after my move, I'd hoped that there would be a good pizza place relatively close to my new home. I defnitely got my wish, in spades! Conicella's Pizza is hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had. Fast, friendly delivery, too!"}
{"text":"The calzones are delicious and affordable.  Something this good would cost $5-7 more in most places.  Fresh dough, quality ingredients--you can't go wrong.  Hoagies are a little more basic, but their hot sausage and Italian have great flavor and generous amounts of cheese.  There is never a sense that they have skimped on their food.  If you are lucky enough to live in their delivery area, order here and not a chain."}
{"text":"I have stopped there a few times for an Italian Sub & it smelled so good that I pulled over & ate one in my car. 

Decided to try the pizza and Wow! It not only looked like it would taste great but it actually tasted great. 

Just heated up the leftovers and realized how flavorful the crust was because sometimes the sauce & cheese hides what they are rested on.

Great experience!!!!"}
{"text":"I know it's a big deal to announce this in Pittsburgh but after living here for 4 years and eating my way around the east end options I am ready to announce my absolute favorite pizza. Here it is. And is everything a pizza place should be. It is the best cheese, best sauce, best grease, and best dough I can have delivered to my door. I am so happy its right in my neighborhood.  Sausage, olive, pepper is the way to go. Damn. It's great delivery too, always smoking hot. I am not talking specialty pizza or fancy smancy cooking styles. I am talking the type of pie your mom and dad ordered on a friday night after giving up on cooking. And it is familiar and delicious."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Greenfield. 

Food:
This pizza is the pizza that looks like it does in cartoons. 
Reasonably priced. 

DO IT OR ELSE. 

Ambience:
Get your food and get out. 

Staff:
All you want out of a pizzeria staff in Greenfield. Read between the lines, people. 
Always willing to give extra dipping sauces! 

I think they are cash only, you've been warned."}
{"text":"THE best pizza -- great sauce (not too sweet and not too acidic), great cheese blend and crust is not too thin, not too thick to fill you up and it's never burnt.  I think we like their italian hoagie the best -- you will never get too much hoagie roll as compared to meat/filling and it's toasted to perfection.  My kids love the pizza bagels.  If we don't get delivery, we can be sure to see owner Carmen Conicella with a smile on his face and friendly conversation when we stop in for pick up."}
{"text":"This pizza IS PIZZA! SOOO DELICIOUS! The crust is perfect, sauce delish and enough cheese to satisfy the cheese lover in all of us! GO! You will be happy happy happy!  They are cash only! This was my FIRST time having it and I live close enough to become a regular!! Directly across from St. Rosalia church in Geeenfield!"}
{"text":"Ordered a mushroom cheesesteak hoagie. It was one of the best cheesesteaks I have ever had. Meat was tender and seasoned well. The bread was toasted perfectly, outside was crispy, but not too hard and soft on the inside. The Italian dressing was the perfect amount to compliment the sandwich, not over power it. We will definitely be ordering from here again. Delizioso!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza I've ever had. I grew up with it and every time I moved around the city I will still drive out of my way to pick this up for dinner. It's all about the cheese mix and nice thick crust mmm their pizza bagels are another favorite of mine also"}
{"text":"This is my go-to pizza delivery place. They have a special where you get a two topping large pizza with a 2-liter for $16 I always get. I love their sausage and green pepper pizza. They also have all the old Pepsi signage relics from the 80s. Delivery is always on time and reliable, cash only"}
{"text":"This is a small pizza place in Greenfield with take-out and delivery.  The pizza is excellent and pizza bagels are delicious.  They also have a variety of sandwiches.  The meatball hoagie is one of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. I recommend."}
{"text":"Ever think back to your early 20s?  You know, when you were single and had your first apartment?  When you did your own budgeting and your own grocery shopping for the first time?  Ever look back at the neighborhood you lived in & the places you went?  

Me, I lived in Greenfield from the time I was 23 up 'til I got married at age 27.  I used to satisfy my pizza cravings here and I remember it being great pizza at an absolutely hole-in-the-wall place.  I'm proud to say, it hasn't changed a bit. Rick and I just wanted some takeout for dinner and since I was looking back at some of my old reviews, I thought we'd check out Conicella once again.

M-m-m-m!  Greasy, yummy, bad-for-you pizza!  We ordered the white pizza with sausage, hot peppers & mushrooms on it.  Terrific!  Especially if you're like me and you fold your slice as you eat it.  I know my Chicago friends are cringing at the thought of eating it that way!"}
{"text":"Solid, inexpensive pizza. It's our go-to when we're looking for something quick and tasty. The chicken parmesan is made with frozen store-bought chicken patties... obviously not as good as fresh (or worth 4 stars), but still delicious."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza, perfect sauce and all the right seasonings and tasty cheese make this a pizza to die for one of the best piZzas i ever has"}
{"text":"Ambiance:I actually tried calling the place 5-6 times over 2 hours to put an order in but it only kept ringing, didn't make sense because when we stopped in there were like 4 people there... We eventually got through though and food was ready within 15-20 minutes. The place itself feels like a tiny shack, almost like they're running it out of an alley. There is NO seating so it's take-out or delivery only. The workers were quite friendly though and seemed like bunch of old italian men.

Food: Our favorite part of the meal, surprisingly, was the meatball sub. Maybe one of the savoriest subs i've had in a long time with HUGE tender beefy meatballs drenched in a rich marina and served on a serious french loaf. The price seemed high at $7.50 but it can easily feed two people. Our pepperoni and mushroom pizza was good, nothing special and not gourmet but still tasty. Our crust still had a little crisp despite steaming in the box on the trip home and the sauce has a mild but savory marinara flavor. The best part of the pizza was definitely the hefty cheese layer which you actually had to bite through because it was so substantial. Pepperonis were mild but generous along with the mushrooms. The large can feed about 4 people.  

This hole-in-the-wall place won't be winning any gourmet awards, there are no specialty ingredients or flashy combinations, but it may win you over with its down to earth charm. Definitely worth a try with the appropriate expectations."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our way to a wedding and decided to try the pizza since my friend had told me when she spotted this place it had an \"authentic\" pizzeria feel.  We walked in and there was only one man working and he told us that they only accepted cash.  Since we did not have any cash on us we walked up the road to the atm and took out some cash.  We both ordered the small pizza and they were a good size.  The crust was fluffy and definitely could feed two people as long as you didn't have huge appetites.  My friend asked the man about the history of the place and he had said they've been in business over 30 years.  There are no tables and this place is completely takeout but we enjoyed this pizza."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday evening by myself to pick up a pizza for dinner. I don't know that I would have found Conicellas on my own but luckily some fellow elite Yelpers recommended them to me at one of our events.  I ended up calling Conicellas at around 7:00 and was told that my pizza would be ready in 20 minutes.  So I plugged the location in Google maps and off I went.  I am actually quite glad that I had the maps app too as Conicellas is a little further down Greenfield Avenue than I expected and right across from a church/school.  The outside of the place isn't much to look at and the inside consists of a small area to pick up your pizza and that's about it.  Whenever I arrived at 7:30, my XL cheese pizza was ready and I paid $12 cash and was out the door.

As with all pizzas, the pizza here can be broken down into its three major components: sauce, crust and cheese.  The sauce on Conicellas pizza didn't really have any spices in it that I could taste.  Don't confuse it with boring or bland though as the tomatoes brought a brightness to the pie and I enjoyed the slight acidity to them which helped to balance the cheese.  Speaking of the cheese, it had a nice flavor to it and there was an ton of it.  As a matter of a fact, the first piece that I tried to eat had half of it slide off because of its proportion to the thin crust.  Last but not least was the thin crust which I thought was fantastic.  It was super crispy and on the first two pieces that I ate I audibly crunched through each piece.  Then after it sat for a little while the center of the pie became less crunchy while the back was still nice and crisp.  It had a nice flavor too and I think I could taste a little yeastiness in the middle of the crust at the back of the pizza.

The bottom line for me is that I will head back to Conicellas again in the future.  As a matter of a fact I plan to take my wife in the near future as I am absolutely positive that sure will love this pizza, especially the crispy crust."}
{"text":"Had these guys for the first time last night - we are new residents to greenfield- very impressed!!! Don't miss his place due to its size and appearance - the food is spectacular. The menu is very small, however, if you do something well, why not stick to the basics? Sometimes the most unassuming places are the best!

Guy on the phone and guy who delivered were really nice. Quick delivery - 30 mins on a Friday night at dinner time! 

The pizza: very good!!! The crust is crunchy yet chewy and has a nice flavor. Thinner in the middle and thicker toward the crust. Nice browning. The sauce is mild yet flavorful. Not spicy or sweet, just pleasant. Cheese: delicious and plenty of it! Tip: let your pizza cool or else your cheese might slide off!!! My only criticism is that there seems to be more cheese in the middle and not as much toward the crust. My husband got sausage and I got plain cheese - I usually don't like sausage but his was maybe one of the best I've ever had!!! My dad got peppers and onions and wasn't disappointed. We also ordered a chef salad - I don't think you could've fit one more thing in there - very good! We also got a free 2 liter of soda. All of this for like $35...not bad! 

For us...we liked it way better than Rialto. A must try when in the area!"}
{"text":"We've lived in greenfield for a little over a year and hadn't been to this place yet. My husband and I were in the mood for a white pizza and decided to give this place a shot. The place was tiny and charming with old pictures and articles on the walls - there's no room to sit - take out or delivery only. The price is right (paid $13.50) for a white pizza with ricotta cheese added and it was delicious. My only suggestion would be for them to carry a few more topping options (we asked for chicken but they didn't have it). Otherwise, a fantastic place for local pizza and we'll definitely order from there again."}
{"text":"Unassuming places bring the biggest surprise!  I've passed this place often.  I've wondered about their pizza.  I've thought about ordering but ended up going to the places I was familiar with.  WHY WHY did I wait?  I finally ordered-- delivered because I felt lazy...  .   I actually spoke to someone at the shop--surprise!  And the delivery was quick.
I ordered mushroom Pizza and their Chef Salad.
Portions are great!  Pizza was really good--good crust and the salad was fresh and overflowing!  I'll be back to order again!"}
{"text":"Place like this are why yelp is great.  Having tried every pizza in a 10 mile radius we decided to give this place a shot.  It sure as hell doesn't look like much but we ordered for delivery and let me tell you there is a reason this place survives.

I have to say this i some of the best pizza around.  My wife got sausage and it was great.  The peperoni was pretty good but get the sausage and you won't be disapointed.

The food arrived promptly and hot.  This si our new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"I live nearby and this is the best pizza I've found in the area. Always really good and affordable. I love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Dough, crust, sauce and cheese are on point. Could use a bit more garlic but other than that this is a standout. I'll definitely be back. It's takeout/delivery only. Place is tiny and they don't take credit/debit cards. Other than that it's a must-visit."}
{"text":"Local, tasty and unique. It's one of the best Pizza's I've had in Pittsburgh."}
