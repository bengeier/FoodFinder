{"text":"I get something at Timmies everyday and for a long time I wanted a store at this location. One finally shows up and I feel some higher power has deemed it necessary to torture me. Do not be fooled by the new bistro style decor, this is one of the worst locations I have been to.   You could be the only person in line or the 9th person in line but you are almost always guaranteed  to wait forever before someone takes your order. The staff will literally look at you and walk away. What kind of trolling is this? I have been to locations where there are only three people behind the counter with faster service than the +5 that I always see here. They will screw up your order more times than you can count, if you get more than a coffee from here.  My family and friends also complain about their service and quality that they started getting their coffee from mcds next door. Sad day for me when I have to get my coffee from mcds instead of timmies."}
{"text":"Negatives: Wifi does not work. People hanging outside. Too loud to have a work meeting.  Positives:- Courteous staff. Good food"}
{"text":"En plus des beignes et du café, ce qui fait maintenant la renommée de Tim Hortons, c'est le cappuccino glacé!"}
{"text":"We found this location near our hotel while visiting from the US.  We heard that we had to go to a Tim Horton's while here.  Maybe this was the wrong one.  The food was mediocre...probably would rate it 3 stars.  However, the service that we received was horrible.  The young lady behind the counter would have had to seriously try to be more rude.  I tried to excuse it as a bad day (we all have those), but she was polite and even friendly to everyone else that came through.  I can only assume her attitude toward us was due to us being obviously from out of town.  I realize it is one employee at one store, but that is the face of the company...a company we will not give business to again."}
{"text":"Food preparation is different and not as good as other Tim Horton locations.   The focus here is so much on speed that preparation suffers.  Case in point their Oatmeal is like water and shoddy."}
{"text":"Poor Costumer Service..  & Everyone working there share the same background of race and it's not professional I wish for the best."}
{"text":"Hasn't made a mistake in my coffee orders, plus.  :) 5+ visits.  One of the fastest drive thrus', most times.. And friendly service!   It's Tim hortons folks, nothing breakthrough here. Just pick up your medium coffee with 2 sugars half cream with a sausage wrap with the savory sauce and you're good to go. I do."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever experienced . Ordered a two coffee in drive thru with my wife Sunday Dec 14 at approx 830pm ( should help narrow down the employee with time and date) she was very rude when ordering. We pull up to the window she first passes me a coffee labelled DD it was not even close to what I ordered. I tapped on the window and said this must not be mine she was so rude and laughing and just said to the other employee just put more sugar in it. I asked to speak to the manager she said I am in charge. No wonder we were the only person in the drive thru. Very rude and could not care less about customer service or the business."}
{"text":"I never thought I would write a review of a Tim Horton's but I think after being so annoyed with service and product quality I'm doing to do just that! So this Tim's is located just a little ways from my campus and a short distance from home it has all the convenience for  person who can't function until they had had coffee. There is promise of a decent cup of joe from most Tim's I won't go to say it is the BEST unlike some very loyal Tim's customers but it does the job.  So what went wrong at this location exactly? Also I should mention there is one just a block away in the esso and there is a huge difference. First of all who ever built this location with a drive through that snakes around the parking lot I'd like to slap. This Tim's is always pretty busy. With having Dixon's, Kids and Company and a tiny strip mall all in the same parking lot there isn't anywhere to go/park at times and you can easily fall victim to a Tim Horton's traffic jam just trying to get in/out of the parking lot.  Second the cashiers here don't know how to handle cash apparently. I gave exact change and he kept telling me there wasn't enough and I sat there and counted it out for him more than once and he was like yea your still missing 25 cents.... which I wasn't. $4.29 Apparently pennies just throw people for a loop. A line is forming behind me in this process by the way. If you were behind me this night I apologize but I'm not giving out more then I actually have to pay finally he was like... oh well whatever and put the money in the till. I would have seriously stood there all night if I had to.  Second of all when I got my bagel it wasn't even toasted not even slightly warm and the cream cheese was all in the center instead of on the bagel. At this point I was in my car trying to scarf down my \"dinner\" and after the money fiasco was reluctant to journey back inside again. It was like eating a stale but doughy hunk of bread trying to mask this fact by slathering cream cheese on it.  Now comes to my coffee. I got a large coffee as night class is brutal and I just want a coffee to sip for 3 hours... how hard is that? It wasn't even full it was more of a medium inside rather than a large.  The only saving grace was that it was hot and tasted pretty good for once.  I wasn't even going to waste my time on this review until someone in my History class today mentioned THE TIM'S down the road on Bannister is AWFUL. So I did this for not only me but for others to not waste their time and money here. end rant."}
{"text":"Not a coffee regular like I once was, but this Tims outlet gets my poor review for the big C. That being, consistency..... I've had coffees that tasted like a month old, then on rare occasions, its been fantastic. Bagels that get 3 times the cream cheese they're supposed to, sometimes, barely wiped on. All in all, some lackluster service from this crew.   I guess you can't expect much from a counter full of high school kids. C'est la vie."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a nice breakfast for not a big amt of money! I'd recommend to all that is comming to Canada once it's such an traditional store in the country!"}
{"text":"I don't bother with this location very much.  It's like some kind of social club in here with people speaking VERY loudly.  Use your 'indoor' voice, people.  Make sure you've got your ear buds with you or get your coffee/food to go."}
{"text":"No decafe coffee........really?!, , thats just weird to me, even mcdonalds has decafe........get with the program Timmys!,"}
{"text":"I always come to this place,  its near my house and they always serve a fresh coffe and good customer relations."}
{"text":"I go In here once and a while on my way to work, every other time I have to wait over 10 minutes for one coffee. Last weekend on the way to the cottage in the morning I had to wait over 20 minutes !!!  The one time the lady was rude to me but usually the workers are nice. However food wise there is nothing wrong with the place"}
{"text":"I go to this tims almost daily as it is on my way to work. The service here is very friendly and pretty efficient. The line is frequently out the door, but i do not blame that on the employees. It always seems like they are one person short to deal with the rush. Also, whenever the owner is there working he puts the place to almost a standstill. I frequently spot him micro-managing his employees which slows down the coffee making production! When he is not there, that line through the door moves much faster. The people there are great at what they do and don't need coaching in such a critical time. An extra employee during the rush would help emensly."}
{"text":"Today, I was at Tim Hortons, at College Park, in Toronto. I wanted to buy black coffee and cream in the side. The front desk staff knows me as I cone there at least once every week, and they are jealous of me. Number of your front desk employee think that I am single and looking for date. They perceived me to be a new immigrant from Italy. So, they are harassing me like dog. The server was laughing at me when I asked her to deliver my coffee before I pay for her service. She refused, so I had to call the manager. Then, the manager came along with three other employees and they were all puzzled at me, because of the hidden gossip that they spread against me. Mind you, I am married man in my 60's and I don't deserve this treatment from your twenty years old sluts. The customer service is such cowardly and filthy beyond what I may explain. I hope that this will not last for a much longer."}
{"text":"Across from the conference centre, this branch of Timmies is faster than the other I tried but still not great.    While thankfully everything is centrally made and only warmed in store, I would hesitate to recommend it. I suggest going elsewhere for coffee."}
{"text":"This branch of Tim Hortons probably typifies the traditional French style of service in Montreal. You get ignored, the staff are rude and really I've seen cleaner ashtrays. I know it's a Timmies and was close to the hotel we were at but dear goodness I'd rather walk further in bare feet. Just because I don't speak Quebecois anymore does not mean you should treat me like an annoying bother.    There are other coffee shops not far from this one and while they may not be Timmies, they are certainly cleaner, politer and a much more pleasant experience .    While you always have time for Tim Hortons, give this one a miss"}
{"text":"No place to sit because people especially humber college students take the tables and don't buy anything .tim hortons don't care that they have lost a lot of reguler customers. Poorly run business."}
{"text":"I was appalled by the rude service.  This location tarnishes the entire brand for me."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for a quick bite to eat ... i can always rely on their chili. Good stuff.  (Plus they're next to the Walk-In medical clinic that's open to midnight which makes them extras convenient.)"}
{"text":"This is a terribly run Tim Horton's. It's mostly crowded with obnoxious teenagers during the lunch hour. When I have to stop in for lunch, as one of the few places close enough to work, I dread the chaos. The employees I've interacted with (mostly on cash) are also not that pleasant. I'm guessing the lunch time manager doesn't know how to handle the lunch time rush - he's pretty inept and constantly overwhelmed everytime I see him. Additionally, I'm usually a fan of Tim Horton's food - like the potato wedges. And the wedges at this location are quite possibly the stalest, chewiest pieces of garbage I've ever put in my mouth.  ***AVOID THIS TIM HORTON'S AT ALL COSTS***"}
{"text":"Attention, c'est une chaîne de cafés. Il ne faut pas s'attendre à un café fait avec amour et de grande qualité.  Mais lorsqu'on a besoin d'un bon café filtre, rapidement et pour pas trop cher à emporter, Tim Hortons est là pour nous satisfaire!  Le service est toujours rapide et efficace, je ne demande pas plus."}
{"text":"I would never go here again. This is not our beloved Canadian institution... this is a sad assembly line of sorry excuses for sandwiches and weak coffee. An incredibly grudging, wary woman put condiments on my sandwich and shoved it at me. I know the line up often goes almost out the door, but gah...  Also, I was sharply turned down, if not border-line reprimanded for trying to use VISA. I just shake my head."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Seems to be high turnover with staff because every time I go in there is a new face with a name tag that says trainee on it. I have to repeat my order multiple times for them to understand what I want and once I finally get it it's usually incorrect. Worst Tim Hortons. Don't bother with it."}
{"text":"It's Tim Hortons - won't say any more..."}
{"text":"Service de merde et bouffe de merde. Rien de moins....typiquement nord-américain."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons,you have out done your selves.This location has good service and is always packed.The timbits and donuts are amazing."}
{"text":"This is a Tim Horton's much like any other, with the following exceptions:  1) The staff are really nice - I come here frequently and am always charmed by the many lovely women working here. They are accommodating with any special requests and are always laughing and joking with each other, and very friendly with the hordes of customers. Something is clearly being done well here by the management. Let's face it, this is not the greatest job ever, but they make it seem fun.  2) Coffee is always fresh - perhaps due to the volume of business. Often when I go to other Tim's, the coffee tastes bad. Guaranteed to get a consistent cup here. Whether you like it or not, at least you know what you'll be getting. 3) Efficient - when they first opened up, service was a bit slow, but they have a great system now, and even when the line is very long (out the door) you will not have long to wait."}
{"text":"Well this is awkward. I used to love this place. it's pretty much in the middle of the way from home to school and i spent a lot of nights there. I liked to hang out for a few hours till 1-2am and work. I specifically loved it because it has booths and theyre comfortable unfortunately the staff is awful and rude. for one, if someone goes to them and ask for a seat they would kick you out no matter how much you buy stuff. a lot of people studied here because the library next door is renovating and is closed. one day they decided to kick everyone out to open space for others. a couple of the staff started shouting about how people who want to study should go to the library and not be there. they even kicked out a few people who were having lunch. very awful environment. luckily i found myself a new place to go and will never return to this place. if you plan on spending more than 5 minutes, i suggest you find another place."}
{"text":"This is a brutal Timmies. They always screw up. I'd go to the one on 130th might be busy, but you will get what u ordered. They can't make coffee how you order it and they can't make a bacon and egg breakfast sandwich. What a waste of space. Wish I could give them zero stars."}
{"text":"Just absolute garbage. Tried again to go inside and order and left with nothing. If you are even able to communicate what it is you want to order to the people working there, they'll probably still get it wrong. I hate that this is my closest Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and convenient location if you live near the apartments by York U."}
{"text":"This location is close to the highway on-ramp and is a great for loading up on some caffeine or a snack before heading back down south. There is almost always a parking spot out front which is rare for this part of the city.  My review is directed at the American Montreal visitor.  If you are used to ordering at Dunkin Donuts, the small coffee here is slightly smaller than back in the states, as is the medium and so on.  Keep that in mind and also keep in mind that the sandwiches are all fresh and delicious.  I especially like the turkey and bacon on a bagguette.  The bread is always fresh and chewy.  The donuts are pretty decent as well, no better or worse than Dunk's.  I haven't tried the egg sandwiches in some time but I suspect they are the kind with fake micro egg, try it at your own risk."}
{"text":"For me, this is hands down the most consistent tasting Tim Horton's coffee. I am almost never disappointed - and that is rare for any Tims.   This place is extremely busy from morning to night, the drive thru is always jam packed often causing traffic and congestion issues, their product is always fresh as the turnover in this place is unlike any other Tims I have seen.  There are many interesting folk who loiter and frequent this place, most times keeping to themselves, but pass that and you always get great coffee"}
{"text":"the worst timmys drive thru.....  bad sales associates, attitude, specially early in the morning before 5am,,  next time will post with the associate name, date n time. cuz they deserve it."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out while having a cup of coffe.. Great staff .. Recently renovated... Always buzy"}
{"text":"I was pretty bummed out that this particular location doesn't have birthday timbits but then again the other location at The Core doesn't have it as well.  One thing I love about Tim Hortons is that they are very fasted pace, no matter where you go they'll always have a cashier and someone else to grab your order. If you don't experience that service it's either you visited at a slower time or they're short staff but regardless you're suppose to receive fast customer service.  Since this Tims (and the other location) didn't have birthday timbits there goes my original plan of ordering a box of timbits but I still managed to grab a donut and an ice cap while I'm at it.   I decided to order their speciality donut, the Raspberry Truffle donut. I've had it before so it's nothing new to me although it was hard to debate between the strawberry shortcake donut and that one other chocolate specialty donut. All I can say is yes it's sweet, it's like the Boston Cream but instead of the bavarian cream (the filling inside) they substitute it for raspberry filling and have what I believe are raspberry like candy on top, more like jubes but even better."}
{"text":"*incoming long review*  Location review:  Tim, Timmy's, Tim Horton's or however you want to abbreviate the famous fresh coffeeshop is totally up to you!  Finally a full service Tim Horton's that I can now go to and have a double double in a China mug while just relaxing in the environment is what I have been waiting since the beginning of December. Mckenzie Towne Tims opened up on Sunday December 11 and by far has been pretty up to speed against their surrounding Tims neighbours. The only downside is that they don't have a drive thru but hey that's alright, it just means that guest will have to go inside plus it would be less stressful for the staff  One thing I love about this location, besides the fact that I became one of their regulars, is that the owners and manager will greet you in the lobby and asking about your experience that you just had. To me that's a big plus since other locations in Calgary doesn't have that kind of service.   Product review:  I got myself a garden salad with crispy chicken with a medium black steeped tea. One thing for sure Tims slogan \"always fresh\" does come into play. My salad was really fresh that the lettuce, cucumber and crispy chicken has that crunch as if it just came out of its package. The tomatoes on the other hand held its firm shape, while both the shredded mozzarella cheese and red onion held its place. My steeped tea was really hot and had a strong taste as if it was freshly brewed!  Like all other Tim Horton's that I've been to, I got nothing but love for this coffee shop and yes it is a definite +1 in my books. I would love to come back here more often and would recommend this location to my friends and family...and of course other Yelpers as well.  Ps they are on Instagram as well @mckenzietownetims"}
{"text":"We drove through the drive through with intentions of trying the new perfect pairings. As we asked the lady what the options for the soup were, we were surprised to find out chile was an option. We asked if there was an additional price and were precisely told \"no\", therefore we gladly ordered it. When we got the receipt, we noticed there was an additional charge of $1 and asked what it was for. The rude lady at the window said it was an additional charge for the chili, which at that point caused some confusion, since we were specifically told beforehand that the chile was the same price as all other soups. We asked to speak to the lady who talked to us through the intercom and she argued that \"yeah it's the same cost... it's $1 extra\", completely contradicting herself. This hypocrite refused to admit her fault in the lies she told us and therefore we were forced to speak to the lady at the window, who again, did not acknowledge that it was her mistake and that we were wronged. We were in a rush to go, hence going through the drive through, which is why we did not bother to argue for the dollar back that we should have been given automatically if they knew anything about morals, ethics, or even the basics of customer service. They would not even let us change our chili to a soup to avoid paying the extra dollar and said we were holding up the line. The obnoxious employees insisted it was not a big deal since it was only a $1 difference, but if it wasn't a big deal why couldn't they easily give us our money back for a mistake on their end?"}
{"text":"Worse Timmy's I have been too for  customer service. This comment is not based on one visit , think I have gave  them a few chances."}
{"text":"Just a fast food but the \"glacé\" are very good !"}
{"text":"Une simple chaîne de fast-food, rien de transcendent. Les prix sont cependant assez bas et les glacés à l'érable pas mal du tout."}
{"text":"I witnessed an event at this location that was simply appalling, the staff was unable to get an order correct.  The staff continually said they were to busy to deal with the mistake and it seemed that since the lady already paid they did not care to correct or look into the issue.  It seemed as though the staff member severing the lady suddenly was unable to understand what the customer was saying and after 20 minutes the customer simply threw the incorrect order on the floor.  Now all of a sudden the manager decides to intervene after watching the events unfold before her and offers the customer a refund.  Now it gets really funny as the manager is unable to perform a refund and after another 10 minutes the manager finally provides a cash refund.  If you want to be late for work and have a funny story to tell this is the location to attend if you want to get to work on time or have an appointment you may want to consider another fast food restaurant in the area.  Extremely poor customer, as the lady was walking out I gave her the Tim Hortons head office number in Oakville ON hopefully she has called and complained.  After 30 minutes and four people in front of me ordering sandwiches etc I simply walked out."}
{"text":"Get my coffee here every morning and never had a problem. Parking lot sucks so I park elsewhere and walk over. Service can be a little slow during the busy times but that's expected with any Tim Hortons. The only thing I would like to see change is they run out of a lot of items before noon."}
{"text":"The only reason why I enter this location is to use the facilities when I am in the neighborhood!  The place consistently smells like a large \"facility\".  This makes me wonder about the kitchen hygiene.  The 1 star is actually 0.25 star as it is a location that employs people!"}
{"text":"I live in the area so I've frequented this location hundreds of times and it's always been pretty decent. However, recently the service has become very slow. I think that they are understaffed and this causes people to have to wait a long time to place their order and then wait even longer to receive it. The wait is especially long if you're ordering food, and they don't always prepare it correctly. I think that they should consider hiring more employees, until then I might not frequent this location as much because I do not want to wait that long just for my coffee."}
{"text":"Brown lady working today 26 November 7:15pm is super rude to customers. Is asking the other customers to give out the order instead if calling us. Completely mannerless and not willing to give out the order herself and not available for us to ask for refund!  This tim hortons is right in front of eaton centre!"}
{"text":"Went here this past Sunday with a friend for a coffee. Service was decent, though a bit distracted and we were able to find a seat to enjoy our coffees. A more comfortable Tim's than others nearby.   Frequently use their drive through. Usually moves pretty well and orders are accurate."}
{"text":"I seem to always have a bad experience at this timmys. Every time I get a steeped tea I somehow end up with a coffee, happened to me 5 times and the worst is when it happens in drive through. They  need to label those pots better. I even had an argument with management once, over a steeped tea so now I just wait at the counter until they get my order right. Other than that service is good the ladies are very friendly.."}
{"text":"This place does not have the selection of other Tim Hortons and that really upsets me! I was at work having an intense craving for a chocolate dream latte and a toasted pretzel bagel when I decided to satiate my urges. I got up and drove to the nearest Tim's location (the drive through on Macleod), but lo and behold they had NEITHER of the special treats I desired! I could not believe that they did not have any of the special treats that I desired! Unbelievable! Tim Hortons advertises these products on their website, and not having them at one of their locations in my opinion is FALSE ADVERTISING!  I ended up getting a pumpkin spice muffin which only had about a drop or so of the delicious frosting that I love so much about these special muffins.  Only one drop! I could barely even taste it and that is so sad."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly; however can be really difficult to understand at times. The issue I have with this Tim's location is the slow service.... The drive through can back up all the way up to the street... I have been to many busy Tim's downtown with large volume of customers, same amount of staff and they have moved line much faster.."}

Incredibly spacious, incredibly clean, and located right on De Maisonneuve in the heart of the business district  Service: Standard fare Tim Hortons service - employees - I found - are a little bit more professional than other places given the location  Food: Tim Hortons standard menu - what really sets this place apart is how clean and spacious it's kitchen is ~ really makes you want to there!  It's a great place to meet others and hang out"}

{"text":"This is the best Tim Hortons in Toronto. Unlike most Tim Hortons, I actually like sitting in their dining area and doing work. Most Tims are full of weirdos and uncomfortable maroon chairs. This TH is full of business types and cute doctors (right by hospital central), and the restaurant has huge private booths and nice steel bar stools. They also have two checkout counters during rush hour. If you don't want a bagel or breakfast sandwich, you can buy baked goods and coffee at the speedy express check out by the door. It's a self-serve system, but it's fast and effective. The bathrooms were also very clean - shocking for TH."}
{"text":"I have been living in the area for 6 years,  every time I go to this Tim Hortons the service is so slow, you have to wait so long in line with employees just passing you by paying attention more attention to drive thru."}
{"text":"Very poor service, especially on evenings. They're always understaffed, therefore they lose their patience very easily. They never seem to have anything when it comes to combo meals..."}
{"text":"Timmy's is a formula joint, with passable coffee.  Go in one, no matter where, Shawinnigan, Halifax, Victoria, Calgary, they are, if not the same, virtually identical.  No class, that's for sure.  Their coffee is passable.  Cappuccino?  Timmy does not make it.  It is sort of a ready-mix, made a powdered concoction consisting of instant coffee, powdered milk and with too much sugar.    Their soup & sandwich combos are far better than their coffee.   In fact a good reason to go  there.  The donuts?  Too much sugar."}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service, no one serves me for good 5 mins, I have to repeat my order 3x then missing the soup of my order and won't admit it"}
{"text":"I specifically like this location. It's situated nicely along Roncesvalles and is of a decent size to house a small group of people. There is wifi from Bell which always works and is a good enough speed (5Mbps), a few outlets for charging your devices and it's nicely designed. I also enjoy the 80s music that they play in here over SiriusXM. It rarely if ever is dirty at this Tim's (with the exception of a few insects) and the washrooms are very pleasing. The staff here are hard working people who do their job great but they don't have the best regard for customer service but they're still human and they do a good job in my opinion (I'm not a stickler for good customer service from businesses). This location is definitely visited frequently by the same people and by many members of Toronto's Polish community. Most of the conversation in this restaurant is not in English and the people who visit are usually very nice. It's one of the only decent-priced coffee shops in the Roncesvalles area, along with McDonald's which is down south a bit. I  haven't ever seen any beggars come into this coffee shop at all and Roncesvalles is overall a generally-calm area in terms of crime (it is worse closer to Parkdale near Marion St). I would recommend this location for a grab-n-go beverage or just to sit for a short while. Note that it's sometimes hard to get an outlet for charging in here as the regulars often occupy them."}
{"text":"Every visit to Canada, Tim Hortons is a must go coffee shop. I prefer the English Toffee coffee. Fantastic taste. This shop is just in the arrival hall of terminal 3, idea for who want a cup of coffee when just arriving Canada."}
{"text":"A negative if possible!   This is the most rude and unprofessional Tim Hortons. They sold me on a chicken salad on croissant. I was given a number. When I was waiting after 5 minutes, I overheard there's no croissant. But the cashier didn't say anything to me.  Another 5 minutes later, my number was called and I suspect the they gave me a wrong order (felt like a wrap just by holding on the bag). , and it's not what I ordered. I asked for croissant or at least a refund. Then she told me they are still baking and will be ready in 10 minutes. I still have time before boarding But! ... 10, 15, 20 minutes past, nobody took care of my order. (And there was another lady waiting for croissant too).     Just want to say AVOID this if you can at all cost!"}
{"text":"It is Tim Horton, the product is always the same but the staff and service is different in every Tims. At this one, staff is extremely friendly and works very fast!"}
{"text":"One of the many Tims that seems to emphasize the drive thru over walk in customers.  It's not uncommon to watch 6+ staff cover the drive thru customers while a small inside line up feels virtually ignored.  Overall the store is clean and well organized with standard Tims fare."}
{"text":"This is the worst Tim hortons I've ever been to. Unfortunately it's the one on the  way everywhere I go. Every time I go they get my order wrong and are just completely rude. Over ten times I have ordered my coffee and driven away and it be completely wrong, I throw it away or get it fixed at a different location!!!! And the elder Indian women that work their are horribly rude and cruel individuals. They are so rude they never say have a good day or hello or ANY greeting coming or going. I just have to guess when to drive up or when to leave. And today I had ordered a medium iced coffee and pulled up and realized it wasn't the 99 cent coffee so asked for a small instead. YOU KNOW WHAT HER ANSWER WAS?!!! \"But its already made!\" With a cruel frown staring at me. As if it isn't already humiliating to me enough that I only have a little over a dollar to my name you have to make me feel like dirt about it?!!! I'm sorry I don't have $2 period if I did I'd order a large. Seriously a piece of crap place they don't hire decent human beings or competent human beings. Please check the attitude of these evil people before you hire them or replace them with someone that can smile at me. I have a hard life enough as it is. I don't need rude workers making my coffee to remind me of how poor I am and make me feel like worse shit than I already do. This is why people kill themselves. No human decency!"}
{"text":"This is the best Tim Hortons i have been to, I have had more good experiences here than bad and that's saying A LOT. There is some good solid people working here and of course a few rude but nothing like other locations. I have come here to fix orders botched at other locations who refuse to fix it with kindness. They get the order right the majority of the time and if they don't they rarely have attitude. To be honest I get anxiety going to lots of locations because I don't feel like being mistreated when I am nothing but kind and respectful. I don't care how many times it takes to get the order as long as you respect me. This location however, I actually get excited when it's the one on the way!"}
{"text":"They ALWAYS get the order wrong. Somehow my friend got 4 muffins instead of the one he'd ordered and TWICE now he has been served caffeinated coffee instead of decaff despite explaining that he has a heart problem. THe manager tells them it's too late to brewing a fresh pot so they fob him off with normal coffee.  Very dangerous!"}
{"text":"Didn't like the staff. She doesn't know what is a double double. She added milk instead of cream. I ordered a Nutella croissant and it hardly had any Nutella in it. I eat them everyday. The ratio was 1:10 . When confronted the staff said it was made here and she cannot do anything about it..... Will never come again !!"}
{"text":"Not always busy but still not the cleanest timmy. The staff seems lazy and not happy sometimes. It's on the corner of birchmount and ellesmere and gets filled with crowd that just sits there without buying anything."}
{"text":"UPDATE REVIEW (Oct. 30, 2016): I came here within the last month and unfortunately, they've changed their hours now.  They close nightly at 11pm now instead of being 24/7, and the staff that I spoke to said that it's going to be permanent change, sadly.  The last vestige of late-night food for fellow insomniacs living near Royal Oak is now the Denny's down by Crowfoot.  Good luck to all of you hungry night owls living in the NW."}
{"text":"Sub-par food quality. Beverages usually prepared promptly."}
{"text":"The line moves fast and the staff are friendly.  In fact the guy who served me yesterday might have been the happiest and friendliest server that I have ever had a Timmies or any quick service place!"}
{"text":"J'aime bien faire partie des gens presses qui reçoivent un très bon service rapide .Merci a tout le personnel !Super Job!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever . I was waiting in drive through for 15 minutes  . I left my husband in the car and i walk inside to found 5 workers to talk . No one was in the  drive through window and when i ask  what is going on people waiting for you guys to serve theme manager turn to me and said  relax will you . Wow !!! I  never go back again   NEVER ."}
{"text":"The drinks are good although not stoked that they've removed the hazelnut flavour shot from the menu, hopefully it returns after this pumpkin spice promotion is done. But you can get a good hot chocolate for cheap.  Iced Capps are good too. I get mine made with chocolate milk, it'll rock your world. Especially for someone like me who isn't a big drinker of coffee to begin with. The subtle taste is good enough for me.  The staff are nice and friendly but this place just gets so loud! I usually get my order to go."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons sells breakfast till noon. I went in at 11:55 and asked for breakfast and was told they weren't selling at the moment... Even though it was still on their menu board. I then ordered a pack of 10 sour cream tim bits... I obviously should of checked in the store cause there was not 1 sour cream Tim bit in the box. Will find anther timmys next time."}
{"text":"This service at this Tim Horton's is beyond worst. Employees there are generally rude, when I was in the line up, one gentleman before me was complaining about the coffee he got, and the employee was not responsive and helpful at all, eventually he left. Then the employees laughed about it. When it is my turn, I ordered egg white turkey sandwich, and tea, coffee and bagel, she said \"check your order\" in the most condescending tone, and of cause she messed up my order, and blamed me for not checking my order. It was the worst service I ever got in Toronto. I will never go back again. It made me question the management style of this Tim Horton's."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Timmies, That's for sure.  The only thing wrong with this location is that it is NOT 24 Hours.  If you go in the Morning - It's CRAZY lined up. But don't let that put you down, the Staff that work here are extremly productive and do quite well with Line Managment. I've never waited more than 5 or 6 minutes when it's lined up.  The only other negative thing I'd point out is that this location seems to have dwindling stock when it's coming closer to Closing Time. I've gone at around 10PM before they close, and their isn't a Doughnut in sight.  This location NEEDS to become 24 Hours."}
{"text":"I bought a cheese thing to eat and it comes with a coin inside the package. Them i give the thing back. It's a dirty place not hygienic at all !!!"}
{"text":"I started stopping here instead of the McDonald's across the street when the roll up the rim started this year. Service is horrible, staff is always rude and sarcastic. I asked for a bagel with cream cheese & tomato slices and the lady was not enthused at all. Sorry that's how I like my bagels!! I'd rather go across the street where they're happy to serve you and remember my face when I get my morning coffee."}
{"text":"Fastest drive thru in the city... these people have it ready faster than you can drive around the corner!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Tim Hortons. Bathrooms are clean, and lineups are usually pretty short. I asked for 12 assorted donuts once though, and 6 of them were maple."}
{"text":"Really bad customer service! The workers at the drive-thru always rush you out so fast you burning yourself with your hot drink or spilling it all over your brand new car because they don't even give you enough time to properly place down your cup and food. Other than that, 70% of the time i get coffee from here, it's burnt coffee. So much for being \"always fresh\". I even complained about the servce to the complaint email address and they seem to not give a fuck as they ignored my emails three times. I get my coffee from a little local grocery store now, Concord Foods. Even though they have no drive-thru, at least I get good customer service and non-burnt coffee."}
{"text":"This Tim Horton's is FAST.... if you want a coffee or donut. If you want other foods, it can be slow in the pick-up area since there are so many registers feeding a normal sized prep-area.   The bathrooms are not always clean; they are very busy and people come in just ot use them. The seating can also be crazy.  Net: Good for take-out coffee. Ok for food. Bad for meeting a friend to chat."}
{"text":"They make the icecaps fast and runny, doughnuts are good obviously coz they put it in the bag. Also, there are always these Middle eastern or Italian old men that are either sitting inside or standing outside smoking and they keep staring at you or catcall you or follow you inside before you enter. I stopped going there because it made me uncomfortable. I do not know if they are from the hasty market next to it or not."}
{"text":"I was at this location this morning for coffee. The employee at cash had already scolded the customer in front of me for asking for a sleeve. When I placed my order, she made an error which I corrected. When she came back with my order, it was incorrect and I brought this to her attention. Instead of apologizing for her error, she started to yell at me and not own her mistakes. I would have let it go but when you start to yell at the customers for YOUR mistake, that is completely unacceptable. Not only did she not apologize but she slammed the corrected coffees onto the counter and speak to her co-worker in their native tongue while looking my way. I am absolutely disgusted by the level of customer service from this employee. Don't work in a job where you have to deal with the general public if you can't deal. I was quite patient and polite with her until she started yelling at me like a lunatic."}

{"text":"A surprisingly good Tims with decent food and good service :) the washrooms were also really clean!!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst Tim Hortons I've been to. They are so slow like so incredibly inefficient. I was in the drive thru lane for about twenty minutes to buy one drink and I came late to work. Usually I'm a patient person but this happens on multiple occasions. There have been countless complaints and yet they still choose to not fix anything. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Employees are pretty rude and they take a pretty long time to get things done. It's super aggravating when you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Yelpers, double check your order before leaving, these idiots cant get anything right to save their lives.. Always something wrong, missing.. Its only this location, most other tim hortons habe reasonable seevice, but this location is horrible.. Also, if u have diabetes and order your drink with sweetener, do yourself a favor to avoid a coma... Get your tea/ coffee black and sweetener on the side, as no one sent the mo to these idiots that there is a difference..."}
{"text":"Gave up on this location! The staff are sooo slow and constantly mess up orders."}
{"text":"Staff here are not the nicest and sometimes they are missing items. But a tims is a tims so I'll go back again and hope for the best"}
{"text":"Usually this is a great and very busy location. But today was the worst! I ordered the steak chipotle sandwich and after waiting 10 mins was told that the steak wasn't cooked yet and would gave to wait 10 additional minutes. This is during the noon hour. They did offer chicken instead, and when I opened the bag there was two sandwiches. One was chicken, and one I assume was steak (see pic attached) that was  more like pieces of burnt beef jerky. It was chaotic, no supervisor on duty and the employees were doing the best they could without direction. Management 101: Always have management / supervisors on duty during peak times!"}
{"text":"This is the worst tim horton's ever. The staff is so incompetent. You would think it can't be that hard to put 2 muffins in a bag but apparently it is! Minimum wage should be lowered for these people. Just do everyone a favor and close this branch."}
{"text":"This tim hortons location has really friendly staff, they brighten up your day with their kindness and helpfulness. I like the cosy arm chairs by the artificial fire at this location. Keep up the good work ladies! :)"}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever gotten a soup from this location after 7pm. Constantly out if stock. Couldn't even get a donut on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Dashed in here to buy some soup for my very sore throat.  Decided upon the new spicy Thai chicken.  They now sell large as well.  As I am waking out the bottom falls out of the bag and the soup bun and utensils fall all over the floor.  No one working notices and so I pick up everything and put the soup and bag on the counter to show the staff that the bag broke.   I told them what happened and the staff member told me that she just washed the floor so the soup would be okay.  I told her no I want a fresh one.  While she is getting me a new order I explained to her that the bottom of the bag was wet which is why it broke.  As she hands me my new order the new bag bottom is wet as well.  I grabbed it from the bottom and told her that the bag was wet again and she should warn people.  She told me a few times.... It's just water.   She didn't or refused to understand that she kept making the bottom of the bags wet.  When I got home with my soup the butter was melted."}
{"text":"This Tim's has a different feel to it than most others in the city. It has a more upscale vibe to it and I have always found the staff to be great to deal with.  The furniture still looks brand new.  Overall seating is somewhat limited and they really should increase the closing time to 11pm to match that of the gas station."}
{"text":"The tables are always dirty in this location. There was a guy sweeping the floor when he could have been cleaning the tables. The manager should tell his staff to prioritise and take care of tables first.   The food and coffee is what you'd expect from Tim Hortons, so so."}
{"text":"I completely agree with Pam's review. This location sucks; people are rude and the service is way below acceptable. At other Tims; and specially the one close to my place; I always get half a dozen muffins for the price of 4; but not at this location. This has been going for years. Instead of telling me that this offer is a branch-specific; they won't hesitate to call me a liar. No matter how many times I explained to them that I have been having this offer for years at different Tims; and they are the only one who won't offer it; they fail to nicely explain but rather rudely reply that it never existed at ALL Tims.   Tim Hortons Parent must be watching for those franchisees and do something to improve their service.   The bottom line; this specific location sucks. A one star is even more what they deserve."}
{"text":"Horrible layout. I feel sorry for the staff who stand behind the counter and who have to bear the bitter winter wind every few seconds when a customer opens the door. I similarly feel sorry for the customers who come here at morning rush and who probably have to line up outdoors as the distance between the door and the counter is only a few feet!  Overall though, this Timmies is quite nice. It's clean and the staff are generally polite and friendly, despite the fact that many are still in training. It's very sleek and appealing from the outside (why are the US-styled Timmies more attractive than the original ones?!) and quality of product is consistent.   Wish something could be done about that layout though - once the damned diversion on the 504 is over this location will be right in a prime TTC spot with an inevitable increase in crowds- not sure if they'll be able to handle it effectively."}
{"text":"I didn't think I would need to write a review for a Tim hortons- but this needs to be said- SOME SERIOUS QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES.  Nice people- friendly etc, but I often do not receive what I order (through the drive through- I don't know what service is like inside)  My usual at a Tims is a bagel and a tea...seemingly simple enough. I have received everything from coffee (when I'm currently avoiding it) to donuts (when I'm just ordering the tea..)  I currently avoid this Tim Hortons- which is a shame because the people seem friendly and hard working- but again- I am not receiving what I ordered :(   Also- the parking is a nightmare. but thats the nature of that strip mall area so c'est la vie."}
{"text":"I don't know what but it has some unique taste to the coffee that adds that extra goodness and the staff is so friendly. My favorite location"}
{"text":"I love the French vanilla and this crew is really good in making the one that exactly I want !!!"}
{"text":"Always a mix up on drive thru orders but it is an old faithful when it comes to the food line up."}
{"text":"Entre Tim Horton et une autre très grande enseigne américaine, je choisis LARGEMENT TIm Hortons!  Pour une chaine de coffee shops au Canada, Tim Hortons ne m'a jamais déçu. D'ailleurs je pense que mon addiction à la caféine a commencé dans ce coffee shop, rien que d'y penser, j'ai envie d'y retourner! A oui..A essayer: les Tim Bits, la parfaite pâtisserie si vous n'avez pas très faim mais envie que quelque chose de sucré pour accompagner votre boisson!"}
{"text":"Worst location EVER!! Was in there today around 2:30pm, and there were 5 people behind the counter, 3 tills open, and 2 people ahead of me. I waited almost 5 minutes in line, and once I ordered my coffee and bagel, I got the coffee immediately, and waited again for over 5 minutes. I mentioned this to a lady behind the counter, who seemed indifferent to my mentioning it. I finally got my bagel, with the wrong cream cheese. I had wasted over 15 minutes of a half hour break. Not going back."}
{"text":"Liked the fast service at counter.  Drive through a little slow sometimes.  Most staff is pleasant and friendly.  Wish they sugar twist donuts."}
{"text":"Placed an order and then realized that I have forgotten my wallet at home and didn't have any cash on me. I immediately cancelled the order and apologized, but....believe it or not, the lady who took my order, offered me the meal for free. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Bland... OMG!!! So bland it brings the word to a knew level.  Salt and pepper maybe?  I've eaten here probably 3 times in my life and also last night. This specific location had tons of seating unfortunately it was blocked because the employees are too lazy to take care of it all so they jam everyone into a tiny seating area in the front of the property. Not comfortable, and NOT RELAXING... You know like when I eat, I like to relax and enjoy.  Good luck with that, the employees yell at the customers while giving no assistance with anything. They yelled at every customers until they moved away from the register.  I know Tim Hortons is like Canada's McD's but holy carp they are so far away in taste and quality and I avoid McD's whenever possible. And the worst thing you could ever do.. Its DIRTY, not we had a long day dirty but rather systematic and long periods of uncare, it smelled. And finally, the food was tasteless, this was my first meal all day and u could not finish it. If there is a vending machine or a homeless guy selling burritos out of his dirty pockets... BUY THE BURRITO.  It'll be better than this terrible so called restaurant. The nation should shut this place down. What am embarrassment."}
{"text":"Yes, this Tim Horton's may be extremely convenient if you are downtown or passing through on transit, but expect a line-up.  A long line-up.  So, if you are in a hurry, this Tim's is not the one to stop at, you will not get your coffee quickly.  I have been by this location in the morning, lunch time, early and late afternoon and the same is always true.  Maybe there isn't as much of a line at 9 pm, I haven't been around this location at this time so I cannot comment on that.  Service can be ok at best.  My order has been confused, and even forgotten at times, so I would say patience is required when stopping by here.  Good thing I like a good cup of Tim's coffee or a cheaper sandwich for lunch or I might not stop by here too often.  The plus side?  If you like to people watch, then come here... there is lots to see!"}
{"text":"I think I always arrive at the worse times of the day...  I don't go to Tim's that often, but when I do, it's usually at this location. The donuts are pretty good, but the coffee taste horrible. The service here needs some picking up...they are understaffed almost every time I go and the line just gradually builds longer....and longer.....and longer. And once the line builds up, the workers begin to rush and sometimes even rushing to make your drink (not in a good way). A typical coffee shop, nothing special."}
{"text":"A Tim Hortons near a residential area & a busy road with no drive through. Expect a long line up."}
{"text":"Ça dépanne pour un chocolat chaud ou un beignet mais ça ne vaut pas une vrai boulangerie! :)"}
{"text":"The largest problem is that there is no drive-thru; however, once inside it moves pretty quick.  Coffee is what you would expect from Tim Hortons, and why I go back.  The food at this location, in particular breakfast has been terrible twice and I am unwilling to try it again. First time my sandwich was burnt. Unfortunately I was miles away by the time I decided to eat or I would have taken back as it was black to the point I am unsure why if you were making it you would even serve it. During that same trip they had run out of hashbrowns. Little did I know that was a favor. The second time there I did get a had town but it was dry and rock hard.  I will buy coffee only from this location."}
{"text":"I'm not sure which Tim Horton's we went to, but followed our iPhone directions to the closest one walking from the Hockey Hall of Fame. On the way back to our car, we passed one a block closer. Anyway...   On a freezing cold February visit to Toronto, and after hearing the hype, I told my boyfriend that getting a Tim Horton's coffee would definitely be on our to-do list (we're from Atlanta). Finally got around to it on our way out of town. The cashier lady didn't seem to speak English very well, or at least had a difficult time understanding us (we were probably talking too fast. Canadians seem to speak slowly.) I saw coffee and also 'vanilla coffee' on the menu board, four sizes (?), all very inexpensive relative to Starbucks. I asked if the coffee grounds themselves were vanilla-flavored, or did they use syrup. Not sure why I asked because either would have been fine, but her answer was something like 'powder.' Hmm. They gave us our drinks and we looked for the cream/sugar station - no where to be found. We asked another worker and he hesitated to give us Splenda saying it was already very sweet. Um... ok. Well, it turns out that \"Vanilla Coffee\" = \"Vanilla Latte,\" very similar to the kind you can get at any gas station in the US out of a hot cocoa like machine. Ugh! It WAS VERY sweet and incredibly hot. We drank it, along with our sweet Canadian Maple donut, but left feeling ill, OD'd on sugar.   I told my sister this story, who went to school in Niagara and is familiar with TH. At times she is passionately critical, and I don't necessarily agree with her, however this was her response: \"Yeah, I should have told you, don't order ANYTHING from TH's, no flavored coffee, no cocoa, not frappe drinks, no donuts, JUST PLAIN COFFEE.  It's AWESOME, everything else straight sucks....\"  Ugh.  Long story short, my Tim Horton's romance was not what I had hoped it would be. Figures. Had we had another day, I would have tried one more time and gotten a plain ol' coffee. Place is everywhere (I heard TH's locations outnumber McDonald's locations in Canada) and there are always people there day and night. Next time Tim - you will be mine!"}
{"text":"I found this Tim Hortons to be very unpleasing. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich, and as I saw it being wrapped, I already did not want to eat it. Basically, since the line is always out the door, they do not put any effort in trying to make the food or the coffee good. As I unwrapped my sandwich, the chicken pieces fell apart immediately, and it was disgusting.  They always run out of sugar and are too lazy to refill it, so you often have to wait at the counter for them to run all the way to the other side to get sugar.   As a Timmy fan, I found this place to be one of the worse ones I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Ordered steep tea, got a coffee instead.   Big difference, staff to busy talking and not paying attention."}
{"text":"The food is rather disgusting. The eggs have a texture like rubber, cheese is like plastic, breads and bagels taste like freezer burn, and their toasting doesn't toast properly. It becomes burnt, not evenly toasted. The steeped tea is maybe the only thing I like there. A few other drinks are fine. Even sometimes with my tea has a coffee flavor in it. How? Maybe when you use the spoon to stir the coffee and then stir my tea. I hate coffee. The donuts are always dry and sometimes I find a very cold spot like it came from the fridge or was still warming up from the freezer.... Shall I continue"}
{"text":"Ice Capps taste bad. Bagels are never toasted. Manager is rude. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Anyone who can rate this peasant class establishment more than a one deserves to have their ability to taste taken away. The coffee here amounts to no more than diarrhoea slop and the service is abysmal. They somehow manage to screw up my order everytime giving me something that's the wrong size, doesn't have what I ask for, or they just completely screw it by giving me the opposite of what I wanted. I am inclined to remember a time I asked for a large coffee with two creams, one sugar. I was one of two people in the lineup and the same person who took my order gave me a black coffee with three sugars. What? Could anything be the total opposite to what I had just ordered.   Eventually I tried their food; if you can call it that. Their wraps should be outlawed since all they do is violate your mouth with an explosion of pig slop. No fuck that, I wouldn't even feed that to a pig. Simply horrendous. Their donuts aren't fresh, they're dry, and they have piss poor standards for the creams they use. Their muffins though are thoroughly decent and this the only reason I could bare to give this establishment one star. Still though, I am inclined to think that I'd be better off going to bloody McDonald's for a muffin and coffee combo. At least McDonald's have service standards and a cup of coffee which is worth the five second wait. Tim Horton's coffee gives me the runs, no joke. I'm not the only one. Their bathroom is also a pigsty of fetid turd and dried urine.   I hate this establishment. You're better off walking the extra block to Starbucks or the extra block from Starbucks to go to McDonald's. The only thing this place has on any other establishment is it's 24 hour policy and it's convenience to the McGill campus. Otherwise, I have no understanding as to why anyone would ever bare this terrible 'restaurant'. The only thing I go there for now is so I can have a place to piss in...I'll say this though, I'm no marksman."}
{"text":"Usual Tim Horton's quality.  The staff do not look like the staff you see in their TV commercials."}
{"text":"Poorly managed, drive thru is the worst because the servers are so miserable. I've been treated so bad there that insults are what I'm used to when I get coffee there. If it wasn't close to my house I would never go there. I called head office countless times and they have rotated the employees but it doesn't seem to work. The Iraqi ladies that work there don't know I understand Arabic and Assyrian and I've always heard them insult people and make fun of old people and their kids. I confronted them in Arabic and complained to head office. When I confronted the supervisor there, I was called a dog and an ugly face!!! Lol. Sorry to laugh but these servers think they can do whatever they like. Not here not in Canada!!!  I suggest boycotting this locale at all costs, unless you like insults with your coffee first thing after you wake up in the morning!!!"}
{"text":"While the staff are very friendly, I'm here trying to get some work done while I wait for my car to get fixed and had to stop as my laptop died and there is not ONE customer power outlet. Not one. When I asked a staff member, I was told this is an older location. I'm pretty sure electricians can still make outlets possible!! In this digital age and at a location that offers WIFI, how is this allowed? Not acceptable."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is one of the worst Timmys in the city. Forever long line ups, crap service and poor selection."}
{"text":"Who can count all the Timmy's in Toronto? There is no need, as if you know what are the one close to your work and home about, then that's all you need. Our home Timmy's at Logan and Danforth seems to be ALWAYS busy and full. Mostly filled with elderly Greek men and some people with questionable mental health, but since they keep quite quiet it is okay. Sometimes the place is smelly, because it gets all kinds of crowds.  When writing this post I am thinking of eggsalad sandwich, which I enjoyed last time on that location. I even posted a photo of it, showing how good it looked with my tea. I miss it. But tea and ginger cookies still taste the same on that busy spot.   When planning a visit there, be aware that this is more a take-away place than a sitting in place, as there are seldom empty seats, though for some reason we have always found a place to sit there ;) maybe it is the neighbourhood luck."}
{"text":"I've been to Tim Hortons stores all over the city and this is one of the very worst stores. If you go into this Tim Hortons anytime in the morning and you can expect to wait for 20 minutes or more. The store is poorly managed and poorly staffed. Multiple times I have gone to this store and seen staff coughing without covering their mouth, or talking amongst themselves and wasting time while customers are waiting. Overall I would say go to the other Tim Hortons just down the street. This is what I started doing as I am fed up with this one. 2 stars simply because it'd still a Tim Hortons"}
{"text":"Went: Sat Oct 3rd, 12:00 p.m.  My girlfriend and I shared a combo that consisted of a Chipotle wrap, Italian Wedding Soup and a coffee. It was $8.65 and I think we saved $1.20 versus buying the items individually. We also had bagel and cream cheese. I think a combo is worth it if you generally enjoy all the items, which we did in this case. I would recommend the wrap, just be careful when you are close to finishing, since this is where all the sauce collects and can result in a mess if you are not careful."}
{"text":"Hate going to this one. Service is awful. Constantly waiting at the drive through when you see staff goofing around inside. Order is wrong half the time."}
{"text":"My closest Timmy's and I hate it.  No drive-thru and it's always packed but no one knows where to line up except us regulars.  There is only 1 competent guy that works there and he is obviously the manager...the rest could care less how long you're waiting.    The coffee always seems really watered down and I usually have to add cream and sugar when I get home.  It's only redeeming quality is that it's not AS crazy busy as other Timmy's so parking is usually not an issue."}
{"text":"Their coffee, hot chocolate, french vanilla are not to Tim Hortons' standards, i.e. very watery. Seems like they're trying to safe on ingredients. There is no use of asking for a new drink, it is going to be the same watery."}
{"text":"I, unfortunately gave this Tim's location only 2 stars solely because of its convenience of location directly across Sherbourne Station. Other than that , I want to say so many good things about this Tim Hortons but here is what prevents me:  lineups that are at times, absolutely out the door, a floor system indicating 3 distinct ordering lines that after a couple of years, patrons still do not understand and the store could have made the lineup system much easier and less , at times, hostile (because no one knows where they are supposed to go!) as well as as friendly as the people behind the cash are, they try, there are so many errors in ordering food and even more, to simple coffees. It's a very busy place but here's another issue - zero seating. They certainly don't want you to get comfortable at a seat looking outside all those windows - not sure why this is, because many Tim's locations are this small and even have minimal seating, especially for those with mobility issues and desperately need to sit down."}

I waited 3 1/2 minutes for a tea once that was sitting on the counter right in front of me but all the teenagers that work there were too busy talking to take my money, give me my tea, and send me on my way. Half the time I dont get my total over the speaker and when I get to the window they don't smile or greet me, they take my money and hand my drink out. More customer service training REQUIRED"}

{"text":"Worst customer service... out of all Tim's I went...employees are very rude to customers. Definitely Not a welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Most consistent Tim Horton's I go to. Almost always get the order correct and fast as possible."}
{"text":"Not that I am racism but those Indian waitress there seem like don't understand English! I ordered ice coffee no sugar every time and they gave me ice coffee with sugar for four times! And you know what's funny? I have only been there for five times. BTW, the new desert strawberry shortcake muffin is good."}
{"text":"It's about time Oak Ridges (Richmond Hill) got one of these things! No more do we have to suffer at the 10-15 minute waits at McDonald's for a coffee or driving North or South of this town for another cup of coffee. Fast service, convenient location."}
{"text":"Needed something to eat on the fly and went through the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich. After lining up behind 20 other cars I finally ordered a coffee, double cream and a sausage english muffin. Add on hash brown for 50 cents? Sure why not. Was handed the food and coffee drove away.   When I opened the bag I found a pathetic hash brown that was cold and hard like it had been sitting out for a few hours. Inedible. Breakfast sandwich was cold and dry. English muffin was un-toasted and the cheese was still fridge cold. I dont know if you have ever tried to eat an un-toasted English muffin before but its not fun especially with no sauce or butter. When I sipped my 2 cream coffee to try and lubricate the mouthful of saw dust I was chewing on I realized they had given me a double double.   Reached in the bag to wipe my face. No napkins. Gee Tims thanks alot. And people actually think this place is great? Why? The quality of whats being served there is far below even the most basic levels of acceptable."}
{"text":"Amazing place really. The staff are incredibly polite and willing to go that extra step to make your stay unforgettable.  Bringing food right to my car parked at the back, wiping the dirty table so I can use it, filling the toilet paper when I forgot to check if there was any, and fixing all problems with my basic deli orders."}
{"text":"24 hours and a wifi haven is what this Timmy's is.  I've had a few Tim Horton's donuts and none of them have really blown me away. In between the few drinks I've tried though, the dark hot chocolate is really good.  It's oft crowded but the lines move fast. Now if only they could make their bakery items in house like they used to..."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Muffins were stale and they would not return my money. The French fries were the worst I have ever eaten. They also let children run around and play and yell.  Coffee is good and hot though. I will go back to TH, just not this one."}
{"text":"By far the worst Tims I've been to in Canada. What a joke. Slowest service possible - just co tinue driving u til the next Tim Horton's, you will still save time."}
{"text":"This location is conveniently located at the corner of Bathurst and Dundas across from the Toronto Western Hospital.   Since the renovations,  this location is more appealing with updated decor and has plenty of seating area. The design of the lineup for ordering has been streamlined to make it more efficient and has been very effective.   The best part of this location is being a corner lot because the seating area by the windows is great for people watching at a major intersection if that's your thing.  Definitely makes the coffee/tea breaks and mealtimes experience interesting.   I'm not a big fan of Timmy's because I'm not much of a coffee person, but occasionally I would order their steeped tea and hot chocolate.   The food is definitely a hit or miss and at times you wonder if it's really food. I rarely order food here except on occasion, I would order their donuts and Timbits.  This afternoon,  I stopped by for some Timbits and was not impressed with the service.   Usually the service is fast and efficient with minimal friendliness depending on how busy it is at the time.  There was only one person ahead of me with two cashiers,  but for some reason it took a while for me to reach the counter.    I placed my order and said I'll be paying with my mobile app, for some reason the scanner didn't work and I said you can just punch in the number (while handing my phone over).  Instead of entering my card number manually, the cashier left to get help.  When the other person came she realized my Timbits order was not filled and filled it.  Then, another person checked the register and realized that the original cashier didn't touch payment in order to scan my mobile app. How many people does it take to complete a transaction?   Good thing it wasn't busy at that time.   The person who completed my transaction said to the cashier, \"How long have you been working here? You didn't press payment, you should know this by now.\"  The cashier just laughed. I was very patient throughout the mishap and thanked them for my Timbits and that was it,  no thank you for my patience or visit from any of the staff. This was definitely not acceptable of customer service.  I know service can be bad at times when it's busy, but it wasn't busy during my visit.  After my transaction was fully completed,  there were only two other people in line.  I'm sure this may be a one off, so it doesn't really bothered me, I managed to get my Timbits.  Overall,  this is an absolutely convenient location and fact they're open 24 hours is definitely a bonus for my Timbits cravings every now and then."}
{"text":"If you like ice coffee don't bother because there machine is always down. They make you wait at the side door even when there is no one behind you."}
{"text":"Today I went to this location because when I went to pump my gas I realized my gas tank lid was frozen shut.. I had just gotten a coffee but I wasn't about to dump that on my lid to melt the ice..so I thought go inside and ask the lady for a cup of water...well.. Rudely , Basuki the \"manager\" told me she would not give me water.. I thought she was joking. I asked again and told her why I needed it. She said no. She would not give me any water and I could buy something if I wanted water. I had already bought a coffee.  I needed help my gas light was on and I needed to get gas. She was so rude I've never been so shocked at someone's lack of manners. She kept telling me no water. Even tho the man working at the gas station counter offered for me to use his mug since she didn't want to give a free cup out and she still said no. The nice man came outside to help me and even stated how some people have no sense of reality.. very true. Basuki the manager at store 2179 obviously is not the person to be running a store. She has no manners  or class. From reading the other comments she is always like this. She's disgusting, her personality sucks. She should get a job far away from customer service"}
{"text":"Each time I come to this TH, there are consistent errors with my order. Today will be the last time I come to this location.  I ask for an english muffin breakfast sandwich to be toasted, it arrives cold and stale. I returned the sandwich to the counter for a properly toasted sandwich, the staff only toasts one slice of the sandwich. I tell them that is unacceptable as now i have one toasted side and one stale and cold side. Their solution is to microwave the entire sandwich. Seriously??  The amount of time spent trying to get a toasted sandwich was rather assinine. This happens all too often here. Save yourself the trouble and visit the TH on Hwy7 and Markham Rd."}
{"text":"The place is terrible. the service is terrible, too. I ordered one cafe and went to another shop, they towed my car.  And they wont tell me where my car is unless I gave them my credit card number. I have no choice and  called the police.  I wont go to this Tim Hortons anymore. The owner is too cheap."}
{"text":"I am astonished at just how horrendous this location truely is. Extremely rude, unprofessional, and untrained employees. Most of them speak zero English at all. Truely a pathetic operation."}
{"text":"this is actually the only Tim hortons I've been to that rarely has a line up (crossing fingers) inside, but the drive through is completely the opposite.  My only beef with this yelp listing is I always have to search for it before I check in. On top of that, it says the location is 0.5km away.  One thing I wish they could have done better with this location is the line up layout. Don't you hate it when you don't know where a line starts? Mind you, there's not much of a line up here when I go during lunch, so it doesn't matter much.  Nonetheless, it's a great place to have a break and not have to worry about waiting to get your coffee :)"}
{"text":"So I just tried their new Latte that came out not too long ago, and its decent. Its not starbucks, but for half the price, who's complaining? Its not as strong and robust as a Starbucks latte, but its more milky. Remember to take half a sugar, cause it can get quite sweet if you get the regular latte. Still a thumbs up, but I've had better. I would go back to get it."}
{"text":"The only thing this place doesn't have is a drive thru, & THANK god because they are busy! I go in the mornings to get a simple coffee and the lineups nearly out the door but it always amazes me how fast they can move through it! So you better know what you want because these workers are determined to plow through costumers."}
{"text":"The worst Tim Horton's I've ever been to. Slow, rude, and its almost routine that they will screw up your order in some way. Too bad this is the closest Tim Horton's to me."}
{"text":"This Tims is one of the worst in the city. I take a different route to work just to hit up a different one and avoid this one at all costs. When you pull up to the order window and no one else is in line, you can expect to wait a min or 2 before you're even greeted. When you get to the window nothing is even close to being ready and half of the time my orders were wrong. All this is happening and no one else is in line. It's 5am and the inside is empty and the drive thru is dead. I blame training and management because I've had many different people serve and greet and its always the same result. I was also told one morning at 5:15 am that a breakfast sandwich wasn't available because it wasn't breakfast time yet. What a joke... I've been here about a dozen times and finally gave up. Use the Tims on Heritage down by Costco... They're superb."}
{"text":"The donuts are stale here... I realise they don't fry on premises, but how difficult is it to defrost pre-made donuts?"}
{"text":"Location is great, but the staff cannot accomplish a single order without messing up. No smiles or any hint of friendliness to be found here, and the second you leave you get mobbed by homeless people, who on occasion, enter the store and harass the customer's in line for money while staff does nothing. Avoid."}
{"text":"It gets five stars for what it is -  it is DEFINITELY as good as this sort of food gets. The coffee is flavorful, and they don't overwhelm it with milk and sugar. The tomato bagel with asiago and parmesan is delicious. Their version of the doughnut hole, the Timbit, is perfect. They're denser than I'm used to, which is really quite pleasant, and they're not overwhelmingly sweet.  The people at this location are very pleasant and were communicative despite the fact that I don't speak any French at all."}
{"text":"Is it so tough to have the cash already open when I'm asked to leave another line to go to the other cash.  Also. Can we assign someone who is trained to take my order.  It took forever to take my order them the young lady got it all wrong. I don't Baum the staff, I blame the manager and the owner. Weak. Don't go to this Tim's.  There has to be another one just down the road."}
{"text":"What happened to you Tim Hortons?  There was a time when I loved stepping foot through your yellow framed double doors. Inside was a rotating cake display, friendly old ladies, fresh donuts and coffee strong enough to stand the hairs on your neck straight all morning.  Now, it's an assembly line with big screen TVs and the least attentive staff in the world. But, that's not my issue here. It has to do with packaging and waste. Tim Hortons, you simply blow me away with your waste.  My order was a soup and sandwich combo. The soup comes in a small waxed cardboard bowl with a plastic lid. This is placed into a waxed paper bag. The sandwich is wrapped in waxed paper, then placed into another bag and then put in the bag with the soup. To eat the soup you need a spoon and I guess a knife for some reason. These GET THEIR OWN BAG and are placed inside the first bag.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  This will most likely be the only negative review I ever write. But you've got bad environmental karma Tim Hortons. Keep your US ownership, we should be ashamed to call you Canadian."}
{"text":"The \"drive thru\" is more of a yell thru as no one seems to have working headsets or whispers to you. Poor customer service. The staff also only make one item at a time, so by the time you get all your items, half of it is already cold."}
{"text":"I don't go to Tim's that often, but when I do, it's usually at this location.  The service here needs some picking up...they are understaffed almost every time I go and the line just gradually builds longer and longer and longer. And once the line builds up, the workers begin to rush and sometimes even rushing to make your drink (not in a good way)."}
{"text":"nice to have a coffee shop in our area. not impressed that they are not 24 hr like the rest of timmies. best time for doughnuts is after the bar."}
{"text":"Cheap but bad coffee. Service is fast. Got my order wrong. Perhaps the speaker doesn't work"}
{"text":"Understaffed, quality isn't great but I wouldn't blame that on the staff. Seems whoever owns or manages this place needs to step it up."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if possible. This Tim Hortons is very slow, and every time i have been here there has been some problem. Their hash browns always taste bad and the employees are very rude. If you have a complaint about your order or they forget something they get angry with you, even though they are the ones that screwed up.   Everyone i know now avoids this tims because it is not worth the time or effort. Definitely avoid this timmies."}
{"text":"Great customer service! I visited this store last night around 9:45pm. The service was beyond my expectation. The only staff there was kind enough to offer me a plastic bag for my food bought at another store so that I could hold my tea easier. It was really considerate."}
{"text":"Food is what you would expect.  However service is slower than any other Tim Hortons that I've been to.  It often seems like they are under staffed and there is usually a long line up.    The staff seem to have to work both cash and food prep at the same time which really slows them down. Whereas at other locations, they have usually have people on cash and people making the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Small counter inside of the Esso station. Has a tendency to run out of donuts when they only have one person at the counter and with only one showcase don't have a giant selection. The service was efficient and with a smile.  The Esso station employees often have friends over sitting inside or in front of the station which can make you feel uncomfortable instead of business-like. But otherwise it's fine. It's a Tim's."}
{"text":"Please never go to this Tim Hortons found a hair in my cookie not on top or but baked in I feel so sicken and I will never go back. The lady was horrible barely said hi gave my boyfriend an old bagel said that it isn't fresh and proceeded to be awkward not even giving us the total we owe her. I am so grossed out I am gonna be contacting Alberta Health services to conduct a check up on the store and how clean it really is please just don't go here if you want old food with hair in it. I feel sick to my stomach now , they didn't even have gloves or hairnets on."}
{"text":"This is the best Tim Horton's as far as selection goes. I have been there a couple of times lately and been able to get EVERYTHING I have wanted to buy. The selection of muffins and cookies was HUGE, I find it very disappointing at other locations when they are out of or don't carry more than a couple of choices. The service was also good. Very fast and efficient. Staff friendly. And there is plenty of seating. My only complaint....and one that goes across the chain....GET A DARK ROAST! Since I have been drinking strong coffee at other shops I find the standard Tim Hotron's blend very weak. It is not the coffee that brings me back....to this location.... it is the selection of goodies."}
{"text":"You may be thinking \"what's wrong with you Arc? Have you run out of places to review so early in the Yelp 30 day challenge to resort to reporting on Canada's donut shop? Are you ill? Did you want to sit down?\" Well the answer is I am perfectly fine ... but that is what a crazy person would say!   I feel that I must give my neighborhood TH a review as I do come here about once a month and like it or not it's part of the community. It doesn't matter that water in my tea is so hot it can melt iron. Nor does it matter that eating one of their Honey Crullers is equivalent to injecting sugar water directly into my vein.   I had a honey lemon tea with a cruller and blueberry muffin. The tea isn't the most inspiration thing I have tasted (it does taste a little ashy). The donut might give me a glucose infused heart attack and the muffin, well at least the blueberries excite me. So why do I put up with all of this? Well because the total for all three items was 3.78 and they have nice big tables to do some work on. Oddly enough this was the same reason I frequented my campus' TH when I was a student. Not to mention you get great characters in here. Look around you and listen, the vibe has all the making of an entertaining contemporary novel.   If you are looking for quality I wouldn't suggest coming here. After all Caffe Beano's is nearby. But for me on days where I feel cheap and just want to get out of the house, it fits that need. 11/30"}
{"text":"The service here is sloooooooooowwwwwwwwww. Came here on a Saturday afternoon and there was only two employees working - one making the sandwiches, the other taking orders and marking coffee. There was around 2 people in line when I got there, I waited around 10 minutes for my turn, 5 minutes for my drink. By the time I left there were over 10 people in line waiting."}
{"text":"Muchísima variedad en el desayuno y buena relación calidad precio.  A la hora de atender fueron muy amables, hubo un error en el pedido, pero lo solucionaron rápido y de la mejor manera posible!   ¡Ojalá siempre fuera tan fácil tomar un buen desayuno!"}
{"text":"I work across the street and have been coming here daily for roughly a year. This is the busiest Timmy's I have ever seen! The staff in the morning are under tremendous stress, and generally deal with it well with a couple of exceptions. I fill the coffee order for all of my coworkers and always have a large order. I can tell you that without fail, at least one item is either missed completely or never to order. When you pay an extra $0.50 for tomatoes on a bagel, you expect it to be there....never is. I'm constantly reviewing the order beside the cash register for accuracy.  We have switched to La Prep across the street and have been significantly happier. Unfortunately during the evenings, this is the only option. Thankfully though, the night employees are fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the one place you can go to that will always mess up your order give the fact that I use to work at a Tim Hortons they tell their customers that they can't do certain things that they definitely can do for example toast a croissant or how they have no ice coffee because their machine is broken  ice coffee doesn't come from a machine it's just coffee that has been chilled in a fridge. My last experience was when I asked for a black ice coffee with 4 sweetener (Splenda) they gave me 4 pumps of base and told me that is what sweetener is ?"}
{"text":"The dirtiest Tim Hortons I've ever been to. Flies everywhere!!! Disgusting. The cleaning staff is also extremely lazy. The floors were littered with garbage and spills, I saw one employee walk around the eating area with a NAPKIN and wiped crumbs off some tables, not all. Didn't bother to wipe the seats that caught some of the crumbs. Didn't bother with the garbage or spills on the floor. The management should be ashamed of themselves for running such a disgusting restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"The Tim Horton's at 603 Davenport Rd has been a location I visit quite frequently as it is conveniently located between my home and school. Being only a 30 second walk from College, I figured that it would be a fast, easy way to grab my usual Large Double Double and Everything Bagel Double Toasted with Herb and Garlic Cream Cheese (EBDTHGCC). Upon my first visit around 9:15 am on a Sunday, I had a very pleasant experience. Clean store, friendly staff, quick service. I was sure I had finally found a reliable, conveniently located Timmy's.   Sadly, I was mistaken. My next visit a few days later would form the first crack in the solid foundation that I had created with this establishment.   I walked in, and lined up. At the front of the line, a middle aged woman ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup. about 4 minutes later I got to the front of the line and placed my order. I noticed a large crowd of people waiting at the food pick up counter. I went over to join them. I noticed that the woman who had ordered her soup was still waiting. A few minutes passed and I began to wonder what was taking so long. I looked behind the counter at the food prep area and saw one woman with pink/purple hair furiously tearing around, filling orders. All the while yelling casually back and forth to coworkers, as if she thought she was working at a bar. Very loud, abrasive and unprofessional. When she would finish an order, she would race over to the counter, quickly blurt out the order and run away before anyone knew what she had said. I saw the woman ordered the soup looking confused. Any time anyone asked her to clarify what order it was she was very rude and didn't really answer. I get you have a lot going on, but like CHILL. Unpleasant experience, but ok, they were busy. maybe she was having a bad day. who knows.   Unfortunately I experienced the exact same thing several times after, even when the restaurant wasn't busy.   As for the food, the coffee is always fresh and done right. Never had a disappointing beverage from this location. The bagel however is often underdone. I know I like my bagels crispier than most, which is why I order them double toasted. Almost every time my bagel comes BARELY toasted at all.   To sum up, Ill keep going here, the food's not bad, I don't like that purple haired woman, she's loud, rude, offensive and bad at her job."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location a handful of times, unfortunately and with consistency there is always a slow moving line, slow service. Recent visit was a spent waiting in line with others while counter staff discussed among themselves and then waiting for my order which had been prepared but sat for 3-5 min. No enjoy, apology or acknowledge really, just a look of, whatever..."}
{"text":"Stop by here with the fiance while touring the city. We both split an iced capp because it was on a special for only $0.99. It was perfectly smooth and icy. Flavor was excellent and did not have a bitter taste. Was nice and sweet, but not overly sweet. We also shared a Canadian maple donut, which went well with our coffee (and I am not even a huge coffee fan).  Service was quick here and place was clean. Plenty of seats and restroom (woman's), or washrooms (as is the preferred term in Canada), was clean and well stocked.  There is also plenty of parking, even though it shares the parking lot with a Wendy's. I love Tim Horton's because of the variety they offer, the consistent tastes at every single location that I've been to and the cheap prices, so I have no complaints."}
{"text":"This place is to Canada what McDonald's is to USA. There is one on every block. Every time we passed one there was always a line. The one thing that I liked about the chain is that it offers healthier food items. There oatmeal was hot and fresh. They also had fresh muffins which were good and they happily warmed the muffin for me. As we set and ate our breakfast, it was a revolving door. People were in and out pretty fast. The restaurant was clean and the service was great. I gave the restaurant a three as I only had oatmeal and muffin. Because I didn't try anything of substance from their menu and really didn't think it was fair to give them a higher rating."}
{"text":"Came to this Tim Horton's because my relatives, fiance and I thought we could take a break from our day to have a little pick me up, in coffee and donut hole form.  This place is located in a food court that has a handful of other eateries. When we came, it was during a weekday afternoon around 2 pm- ish and it seems like everyone else was hanging around here to grab a quick snack to plow through their afternoon slump too. But luckily we got a few seats.  My fiance and I split a hot chocolate and a assorted box of 10 timbits. Just delicious and a perfect sweet combination to share.  What I love about Tim Horton's in general is that they offer just about everything Starbucks offers (with the exception of the baked goods... Tim Horton's does donuts and Starbucks are more into pastries) but cheaper.  Even though there was quite a long line when we arrived here, it went by pretty quickly because there were 3 or 4 cashiers open.  Love Tim Horton's and wish there was one here in California."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons location is my go-to location as it is the closest to my office.  The food is consistent and service is quick, when you have those two in your favour, you really can not complain.   I make a visit to this location more often than I would like.  They seriously put something addictive in their coffee and sandwiches.   Their drive thru is 24 hours service, which is an added bonus.  Humber college is down the street; I have noticed a lot of students that hang out at this location.  For a quick bite, good coffee or just a place to hang out, drop by this Tim Hortons if you are in the Rexdale area."}
{"text":"The service was quick. I went here early morning for breakfast of coffee and a muffin. Both were fresh and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Weird floor layout. Below-average coffee. I would choose Starbucks, with its overly sweet coffee, over this. Quick service and what looks to be a large selection of donuts. It would do better as a full-time sandwich shop."}
{"text":"pretty quick service,timmies is timmies,i like it"}
{"text":"There is a Tim Horton on Every corner in Canada. I mean like literally. I am not really a big breakfast person but I took advantage of the maple doughnuts. The Customer service was great too. I arrived 20 minutes before they started serving lunch but they made an exception for me and made me a sandwich that was a part of their lunch menu. They also took my american dollars which was also a plus for me."}
{"text":"Arguably the worst Tim's in Canada. They reuse refused burnt bagels, the service is sloppy and some employees are just disgruntled and hating life. Washrooms are disgusting. I recommend driving south to the one at Caledonia/Castlefield."}
{"text":"I had a sour cream glazed tim bit and it was so gross. First off it was so stale and secondly it tasted like it had pig fat in it - I am not sure if there was but it tasted like it.  Nonetheless, it's convenient and the décor is somewhat modern-looking.   My husband feels comfortable at Tim Horton for it's familiarity."}
{"text":"My donut hierarchy:  dunkin krispy happy donut in san fran  new to the mix: tim hortons  verdict: better than krispy, less nostalgia than dunkin.   good coffee too."}
{"text":"They have a counter where you place your order and another where you take your order slip to for payment. Remember your order number!  During peak times - weekday mornings and occasionally in the afternoon - the queue will reach the door and there will frequently be a huge pile-up as people mill around, waiting to either pay or receive their coffee. It can be a bit hectic, but at worst I've been out within minutes.  The coffee is hot and even though I have a short walk, I still wish cup sleeves were more readily available!  I've never sat in; but for coffee to go, it's decent for cheap coffee and does the job. Also great for boxes of doughnuts to share at the office."}
{"text":"Wow. The service here is horrendous! The employees behave like they have no training, no accountability, and no manager.   They forgot to actually put the donuts in a bag and give them to us. Then they informed the customers outside at the tables that they had to leave 12 minutes before closing, right after we got our food and sat down. Then they turned the lights off on everyone 10 minutes before close to let their customers know they were not wanted.   This store desperately needs a leader present to set a proper tone."}
{"text":"One of the best Tim Hortons in the city. This location is bright, clean and has very friendly staff. The coffee is always good and the line moves fast. I haven't tried the food to be honest, but I notice they have sandwich presses for paninis now.  Worth a try if you are in the area and want a quick coffee or snack."}
{"text":"Nothing too special about this one.  Stopped in here for a bite to eat on the way to REBEL Nightclub with a friend. The food's solid - nothing to write home about. The drinks and muffins are always good. Like other reviews mentioned, the place looks a bit rough - lack of seating, people hanging out too close to each other and staring, and not designed very well - but it's part of the charm of Corktown.  This is a fine choice if you just want to grab a quick coffee."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Tim's in Toronto.  Back when I used to attend the Toronto International Film Festival regularly, this place was my basecamp.  I'd party until 3 or 4 AM, walk from wherever I was (usually the Thompson Hotel) back to this Tim's and crash there for a couple hours until Union Station reopened and I could catch the first train back to Port Credit.  Since then, it's been a favored destination whenever I need a snack. While it does have some issues that keep it from attaining greatness, it's still a choice spot to hang out and grab a sandwich.  It's clear that the people who designed this location understood the flow of nearby foot traffic, because the interior is one of the most expansive I've seen in a Tim's. It may not look like it from the outside, but this place has the capacity to handle a good 100 people or more who are lining up for food. The place is also kept fairly clean, as I watched employees zipping around cleaning tables and making sure junk was kept to a minimum.  Service is hit-or-miss. I find it's better to come late at night or early in the morning because there isn't much traffic. When I visited (as of this writing) yesterday, the staff looked like they couldn't care less. I ordered a BLT combo from an employee who wasn't sure where I should line up to get it, and when I did line up, I nearly got annoyed because the woman making the sandwiches flagged my order as completed when there was still one part missing (potato wedges).  Like others have said, the main reason why this location doesn't get a 4- or 5-star rating is because of the squatters outside the store. Whenever I visit, there's usually at least one man begging for change and yelling at people outside. If you're going to enter here, there's a back entrance just off York Street in the alley that's easy to access.  Still, this is a convenient and decent spot for a lunch if you need to stop in for a bite. Well worth a visit at least once, but keep your expectations in check."}
{"text":"Busy, but service was quick and error-free. Coffee was fine. Chocolate dip tasted a bit off, but not terrible."}
{"text":"Simply asked for 2 separate bags for my 2 biscuits. Marie behind the counter was not impressed with my request. I pretty much asked for a death wish :|"}
{"text":"It's a Wendy's and Tim Hortons combo store.  At a very busy intersection and difficult access to get to it.  Once inside the bathrooms are dated and the tables dirty and a mat was blocking the entrance.  Foreign workers.  Food was good for this genre of establishment.  Sandwiches, chili, coffee and donuts.  Traffic is horrible so avoid if you can't handle that."}
{"text":"I love Tim Hortons! I wish we had it in DC! First of all it seemed cheaper than many coffee shops like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts, but maybe that's b/c we were paying with Canadian money. The coffee is good and I really enjoyed their donut holes."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've experienced at a Tim's. Unfortunately it's the closest one to me. There are often long lineups with only one person taking orders."}
{"text":"The service was slow. Then again, when did Tim Hortons ever gave good service or made your sandwich right ?!"}
{"text":"It's a Tim Horton's but they are pretty bad in terms of getting orders done right. Double toasted bagels are barely toasted for example. They routinely get orders wrong too at the drive thru window"}
{"text":"This store is high on traffic in and out. There service was quite fast and I was in and out quick.  They have their own parking, which is good. They are close to a Canadian superstore as well. Washrooms were in an OK state and quite small."}
{"text":"the french vanilla is pretty good, but it doesnt taste like coffee at all though :)  it was just very cold out and i wanted something to sip on at midnight without caffeine that would keep me up all night. They are everywhere though so just one of those places. Still prefer starbucks"}
{"text":"Felt I had to try the coffee since this place is at every corner in Toronto. I ordered a plain and simple coffee and it wasn't too shabby."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons is Tim Hortons, right?  Most everything is made in a factory somewhere and trucked in, so the product itself is pretty consistent.  But service at this location . . . eek.  I've gone in a handful of times since they've opened, and I always seem to get stuck waiting a good 10-15 minutes, with only a few customers ahead of me.  It doesn't seem to be a lack of staff, there are always seems to be many people there hurrying about their work.  Everyone is friendly and courteous and seem to do their own jobs well.  But for some reason, it just takes forever!  If it wasn't the closest location to my work, I wouldn't ever stop here, because it's just too long to wait for a coffee."}
{"text":"Pay attention to the drive thru pattern, a little unusual.  A little small, but how can you go wrong with Tim Hortons.  This is right beside a bunch of condo's and apartments, so it is extremely convenient if you want to go out for a stroll and grab a double double or a donut."}
{"text":"My least favourite place for coffee near McGill University.  The wait is long, the place is messy, and the floors are always dirty... At night, many homeless people gathers inside the coffee shop..."}
{"text":"I've never seen people work as slowly as they do at this location. We were in line of 5 people and we waited 20 minutes before our order was taken. The pastries tasted like they were baked a week ago and the coffee was bitter, obviously not brewed fresh. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"If you need coffee, its as you would expect at Tims. The service was good and there were plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Not my fav Timmy's. The parking lot creates mass confusion. Who designs a parking lot where cars come in, and have to make a three-point turn to turn around to get out. It's one of the few Timmy's where cars don't have the ability to drive around the location. You drive in and get stuck in congestion as cars try and turn around to get out because they realize you can't drive forward. Terrible design!   As for the location, I asked for a decaf tea with four sugars. The woman then asked if I wanted a double double with the decaf tea together. Seriously? Tough communication skills at this location.   Meanwhile, once they get the order right, the tea and coffee tastes like all Timmy's and the bagels and pastry rival any other location. Just be prepared to wonder who the heck designed this terrible parking lot!"}
{"text":"It reminds me of Panera Bread. Most of the store open 24 hours & they're everywhere in every corner. It has variety of breads, donuts, soups & sandwiches. I personally like the coffee more than Starbucks. The coffee has this robust & flavorful taste and aroma. The only they can do better is to have the self-serve station available."}

{"text":"I really thought a Tim's at the airport would be staffed to the gills, and lightening fast. Turns out, not so much."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons is the slowest one I've ever been to (waited over 20 minutes at 5:30AM), yet they have more than enough employees to work at a faster pace. The service is poor as I asked for a plain bagel and they made me a 12-grain one instead. When I requested for them to switch the bagel, the workers told me they couldn't since they already made the 12-grain one?? I won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the famous Tim Horton's!  Overall it's your typical fast food joint with fresh donuts.  I would highly recommend the apple fritter and some of the little donut holes (or Timbits).    Get a large coffee...their mediums are tiny for us Americans that expect giant coffees."}
{"text":"This is one of the bigger Tim Hortons location, at least in the Laurentians. It's very well situated on the 117 highway. I have to say, I LOVE that it's a 24 hour location as many a times I have gone in the middle of the night needing a doughnut fix. It's usually very clean and quiet with plenty of room to sit inside. There are some seats outside but I think it could use a little improvement because it's in the middle of a parking lot and doesn't have much appeal. The food is always great. Service could be improved a little if the waitresses would not pretend they don't understand English."}
{"text":"Love this location.  The staff here are excellent and remember what I order even though I'm only in there once every 2 weeks or so. Amazingly fast service and the coffee is always the way I like it. One thing I'd change if I could is to have the staff actually enforce the 20 minute maximum stay rule. Other than this the location is amazing."}
{"text":"I'm a regular so they know my order. The staff is friendly and generally quick.  The steeped tea is fresh except in the evenings you need to push them to brew a new pot."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Tim Hortons we visited during our cross continental road trip. The foods were better than most American Fast Foods' chains. The service was much better. It was close to the Walmart that we went to earlier for buying some groceries. Recommended."}
{"text":"TIM HORTONS - I was enjoying a Tim Hortons coffee last night at the Eastern and Leslie location when the assistant manager approached our table and asked if anyone had lost a wallet. Naturally there was a flurry of hand movement as we stood and patted ourselves down. My bud Paul was indeed without his. The lady employee with a devilish smile (she knew it was his because she had checked the photo I.D.) returned it with a flourish. I asked her name and she replied \"Rashada.\"  Paul tried to give Rashada a cash reward along with all our thanks, but she politely declined. After she returned to her work station I asked Paul how much money was in it. \"Little over 700 bucks he replied. The coffee is good and the pastry is good but this one is for the assistant manager and her staff. They are better than good. They the best."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally review a Tim Horton's as they tend to be very consistent across the chain. This Tim Horton's is close to me and I go there often. It can get quite busy. I have never been disappointed. I like the fireplace in the corner and appreciate the free Wi-Fi which I had reason to use today. This is a very good and very comfortable Tim's."}
{"text":"Good fast service, with friendly staff if you go at the right time. Winter iced capp mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"When I knew I was going to Toronto, I also knew I had to make it to a Tim Hortons. Unfortunately, Canadian Jenn recommended I get a double double...but I don't drink coffee so that was out. My lame southern self was disappointed that they didn't have iced tea, so I made do with hot. And over a couple of days, I sampled some donuts (the cake ones were excellent; the apple fritter was ok) and a breakfast sammich.  Service was quick. Location was convenient. I was confused by the queue situation but what do I know. I figured it out and was grateful that Canadians are polite and didn't yell at me for clogging up the works during the morning rush.   Favorite thing? Was the Irish woman that I met who referred to it as Timmy's in her awesome accent. You will forever be Timmy's to me now."}
{"text":"It's Tims...coffee's the same as every other Tim Horton's.  Some pretty random people hanging out in there.  Not Tim's fault.  I probably won't do a sit down in there again."}
{"text":"Horrible the service was absolutely horrible the people treat you like you are a dog and the have no respect for customers do not go here it's better to go to the Wendy's across the street"}
{"text":"I understand you're busy, but taking more orders than you can fill in a certain time is bad business. Waiting 10 minutes for a sandwich with a full staff is ridiculous. Waiting longer, like the people that were in front of me, is worse.  Then getting charged for something that I didn't order, nor sounded like anything I've ordered, is frustrating. Thankfully it was only 1.50 because I wasn't dealing with going back. The man giving out the order at the bar also somehow gave a diet Pepsi instead of a regular, and looked confused when asked to change.  Then sitting down, finally, for breakfast to find I have a lovely cup of mildly chocolate flavoured hot water. Getting ignored when asked to have it fixed, let's just say I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"This looks like a temporary location because it has very few selection. About 5 types of donuts and no Timbits available. Don't have high expectations here."}
{"text":"While on Vacation in Toronto this was My stop every day French vanilla for me got chocolate for my wife .........I miss you Tim Horton !!!"}
{"text":"The employees here are absolutely incompetent! I wanted to order two catering platters for the next day and the cashier never heard about this menu, when I have been ordering this for a corporate event at least once a month for the past 2 years. He called his manager who did not know how to enter either. Afterwards, she called her manager. I have been waiting for a least half an hour now.They figured it out but the order will not be ready tomorrow at the time required as the person in charge is absent. SERIOUSLY! I was not able to order coffee and donuts?! TERIBBLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"They have no cordinance i waited 20 fucking minutes at 6 am in the morning to make a plain toasted bun with butter. 10 people ordered after and got their shit. I also order an ice coffee and they gaved me water down shit, one of them took a shit in a cup put ice and water and gave it to me. How in the hell did they get their jobs"}
{"text":"The location is on the Subway line and the washroom is 3rd world at best, filthy and smelling of urine.  Unfortunately, my wife was also locked in this stinky washroom yesterday for 30 minutes. The unapologetic manager simply got a hammer and screwdriver to open the door. I'm not sure why my wife had to be stuck in there for 30 minutes or why the staff could not be of assistance.  I can assure you that had I been present I would have kicked the door down or at least have called 911.  What if my wife (or anyone?) was prone to panic attacks or claustrophobia? What if she had an underlying medical condition? The staff were untrained on what to do in a situation like this. Not the staff's fault, 100% management. Btw - the coffee was the usual mediocre swill usually served by Tim's, personally I can't drink the stuff. My wife usually doesn't either but she wanted coffee and had to use the toilet. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"The other day one of my friends introduced to me their new cup of java they drink every morning. Half Hot Chocolate and Half Coffee.... where have this been all my life this is by far the best thing Ive drank in ages! It made my morning an whole entirely new experience I want to wake up in the morning to rush to tim hortons to get this amazing drink before work. Im giving this Tim Hortons 3 stars since every morning i come here its a huge line but worth the wait for that half coffee half hot chocolate delight!.   Located conveniently off the highway 401 off Weston!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and normally gets the order right (the rare occasion they will mess up but that has only happened at supper time when I guess they are very busy). Overall great service.  What you would expect from a Timmy's."}
{"text":"This store (Victoria Prk.&Ellesmere) is great for when you want reliable service and not to worry whether or not they screwed up your order. They are one of the faster Timmies that I have encountered and the staff are really good at remembering a familiar face and do not hesitate on talking and asking how your day is going. Yes, they do close earlier than most other Timmies and they do not have a drive thru, but if I really need a fix that badly late in the evening and am too lazy to get out of my car, I may as well by the coffee that is ment for my Tassimo and stay at home. The coffee doesn't taste the same anyways as it does in the store itself, so don't bother, save your money!"}
{"text":"Coming home from university - it's not always easy to study at home. Unlike other places to study near here like UTSC or Coffee Cultures, this place is rarely full or super crowded (unless you're going at lunch) so you don't waste time going to find you can't get a seat. The staff here is generally quick and friendly however it's not necessarily always quick to be cleaned. The food and drink is like in any Tim Hortons and doesn't stand out in anyway - I've yet to have an order be given incorrectly or feel like the wait is too long to be worthwhile. It may not be as cozy as other places but it works. Would probably give it one more star if I saw the initiative to clean up the place quicker - especially since it's not the busiest location. Come here for the timmies, stay if you don't want to waste your time looking for seats at another place!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a pleasant experience at a Tim Hortons at Pearson International airport.  I fly a lot for work and it's too bad I have these same experience every time.  It's not so much the food but the demeanor of the cashiers.  I know they are busy but all are at work.  They also seem to have a look of disgust when ordering.  Also when they run out of a certain item (they run out of fries usually), they make it seem like I should have known that and order something else.  I go by the rule, if you don't like what you do, you should find something else.  It doesn't hurt to show a smile.  I smile when I pay so why don't the people smile when taking my money.  That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"I agree employees at this tim horton location are a, bit rude. Today at 10 pm ( Jan 16, 2016), I went into tim horton to order hot chocolate, there was a, white female who was, extremely rude and, racist, she gave me this attitude and handled my drink is such a, rough manner that she sort of roughly placed it on counter. Then I saw her interaction with the two, white guys who lined up after me, she was all polite and friendly. No thinking on her part..that shes in Korea town, and A majority of the customers are minorities, maybe, she should work in tim hortons in a, small town where there's racist people like her who live there. I'm a regular customer and when I compare this location to the one near uoft, it's not compareable, the the cauasian girls who work at the uoft location are very, respectful and well trained in mannerism and, customer services."}
{"text":"Love the doughnuts, muffins, timbits and sandwiches. Typical Tim´s that´s always kept clean."}
{"text":"Don't let the long line scare you- they are actually pretty fast. I've noticed that some staff memorize their frequent customer's orders and have it ready before they even get to the cash. I'm not sure whether or not I would like this.. I mean sure, its convenient, but what if I want to change my order that day? I'd feel obligated to just take my usual.  Also I always ask for my bagel double-toasted, which they used to do perfectly fine. However in the past few months they would just toast it once and tell me it was doubled. So I stopped coming here for my bagels."}
{"text":"Congratulations Oak Ridges, you recently received your very own Tim Hortons. You are officially a real town/city/village - Heck I've lived here for almost 10 years and I still don't know what to call 'the oaks' so I'll just stick with North Richmond Hill.   Residents here really lucked out with this location, it's the new Tim's format which resembles that of a McCafe. Bar stool seating on one side, a lounge area with comfy leather seating surrounding a fire place (not sure if it's real or not). Also, the booths are really roomy and leather backed - really inviting. There is also a flat screen TV hanging on the wall  - A nice addition!  Nothing special on the menu - typical Tim's fare. Staff is new and a little inexperienced as of yet, I find they've messed up more than a couple of my orders...however they're improving (God Bless em).   My one point that I feel this location needs to address is the lack of free Wifi. The much older and recently renovated Aurora location a mere 7 minutes north has free Wifi 24/7. I kinda expected that here today - no dice (swing and a miss).  Its decent spot close to home, tons of locals hang out here now, amazing how Tim Hortons becomes a community hub when it opens its doors. I like that about this company.  Anticipate it getting busier when Menchies opens up next door in a few months.  9/30"}
{"text":"everytime i go, either with friends or alone, the service always seems good and fast.  lots of friendly faces in this location"}
{"text":"Welcome to biker meet up central. Bring your chaps, over long hair, and 90's paraphernalia cop a seat and get your grub on.   What a surprise it was to see this dual Wendy's Tims combo filled to overflowing with all of Toronto's local bikers. As a warning, there are no wannabes allowed.   For food, I enjoy the fabulous fish fillet, one of the best fillets in fast food fare. Not the best health wise, but their breading is quite like Panko and the fillets are usually juicy.   Bottom line...quick and dirty, just the way I like it, this combo joint hit the spot after an involved trip to T & T.   As a side note, I now know where they are keeping the leftover hobbits from Lord of the Rings."}
{"text":"Chaîne de café vraiment pas terrible du tout.  On sent que tout est bas de gamme, que ce soit les boissons chaudes ou les muffins et autres donuts.  Mais ce magasin a un petit truc en plus... Le service n'est vraiment pas sympathique !"}
{"text":"This location had good service, but I just wish Tim Hortons had more vegan options, particularly donuts! I think they offer vegan apple strudel and some bagels, but that information isn't easily available on their menu, you have to find it buried in their nutritional information. It's really very simple to replace milk in donuts with almond or soy milk- and then even more people could enjoy your donuts, and they'd be healthier!"}
{"text":"Most people should know by now that Tim Hortons is the king of donuts North of the Border.  I decided to stop by and get some donuts to cure my sweet tooth.  This location is on Weston Road near the Ontario 401.  There is a Best Buy and a Subway and other stores nearby for those looking to kill tIt was packed inside and was heavy with foot traffic.  Service was decent.  I took with me a half dozen donuts for $5.49 CAD which was fair for a place of its statue.  The taste reminded me of makes this place so popular among the Canadian faithful."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst services in this outlet. Unclean plastic spoon. Slow counter service. Express line does not mean express. Always stinks. Runs only because of McGill students and takes full advantage of this monopoly."}
{"text":"A Canadian novelty that I just had to visit. Had to see for myself what these 'Tim Bits' were and found they're just as good as donut holes, in fact they're the same things! Silly Canadians... gotta give a special name to them :D Anyways, it was a good location, quick service, great quick and sweet breakfast!"}
{"text":"What's a Canada visit without immersing yourself into its traditional institutions?  I'm talking about first name Timmy, last name Horton's. (Drake reference for those who didn't catch that).  I didn't go all out, but what McD's is for everyone in MURICA. Canadians give thanks and realize there's no escaping Tim Horton's.  So what did I get?  Croissant and a Latte. The Latte although from the machine wasn't bad, just standard fast food coffee. The Croissant isn't as buttery and flaky than what I'm used to, it had a deeper and more savory taste (maybe it's the Canadian dairy)? Either way, after an 8hr flight with only Canada Dry in my system, I needed something in my stomach.  This isn't Canada's standard of gastronomy but after all the episodes of HIMYM and the many Canadian homies who share of their experiences of this place. I just had to join in on the fun and see what it's all about.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This Timmy's is right on the corner of Kipling and Jutland just north of the Queensway. It is a mini version with a single serving counter but open 24 hours. It looks clean and well taken care of and features quick pull up angle parking right outside the front door if you need to go inside. There is also more parking behind the building. It's a popular and essential spot for the bustling retail strip going both up and down Kipling and also going east along Jutland."}
{"text":"Les prix sont très très abordables, les lattés sont bons et le service est assez rapide quand les employés se réveillent pour ouvrir des caisses supplémentaires. Sinon, je ne sais pas qu'est-ce qui cause cette odeur, mais il y a une odeur désagréable dans TOUS les Tim hortons (assez dégeu). Je vous conseil de venir le matin pour les beignets, car ils sont 1- frais et 2- il y a beaucoup de choix. Avant la fermeture, il reste souvent un choix de 3-4 beignets (sec), presque pas de timbits et tous le personnel est épuisé physiquement et moralement."}
{"text":"In terms of Tim Hortons this is a decent one and the experience is certainly more pleasant than at the McDonalds next door."}
{"text":"By far the worst timmies I've ever been to, I was actually shocked and disappointed when I got my food, my boyfriend ordered a bagel for me and it was disgusting. I didn't realize how terrible it was until I opened it up at home. So I went back to the timmies to see if the second time around it'll be better but no, it wasn't. I ordered a cinnamon raisin bagel and it was dry as hell. It tasted expired and they were really stingy on the cream cheese. The only thing that was good was the green tea and the ice cap was decent. The workers looked very lost and confused. One of the Asian ladies serving my boyfriend was rude and did not seem happy about working. She doesn't look like she wants to work there. It was ridiculous service. I love Tim Hortons but this Timmies locstion should get new hires and better management.  TERRRIBLE service AND food!"}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons is like mission control for the busy intersection of Dundas and Bathurst. Wrap around picture windows and a slight elevation let you view the action at the organized kaos going on right outside. There is plenty of seating and the place is kept spotless. The last couple time we visited there were cleaning crews doing the floor and cleaning the windows. It's easy to overlook, but worth stopping in."}
{"text":"I ducked my head into this Tim Horton's this morning and I was repulsed by the service I received. The woman taking my order was in the middle of a conversation with someone as she took my order. She didn't have any concept of 'an inside voice' so she was practically screaming while conversing, and to make matters worse, she completely ignored me, the customer.  To add to that, my coffee was up for a good 10 minutes and she was standing right beside it and didn't even tell me. She even looked right at me a couple of times and just continued with her insanely-audible conversation.  I don't know WHY she had THAT much volume, that early in the morning, but what I DO know is that you couldn't pay me to go back to this location."}
{"text":"This has got to be by far the worst Tim Hortons EVER!!!  They constantly mess up your order, they don't pay attention when you order, and they always seem to run out of items. If you go through the drive-through they tell you that they don't have an item when you arrive at the window. Also, what happened to napkins? This is with most Tim Hortons. I order a sandwich and, when they actually get the order right, they don't put napkins in the bag. \"That's okay, I'll wipe my mouth with my tie\"."}
{"text":"Located right inside the Scotia Centre, this Tim Hortons is in the ideal location. It's right on 7th Ave, which means it's right beside the train line.   Having this Tim Hortons where it is makes it easy to hop off the train, grab a coffee, and then be back on your merry way.  It's also the perfect place to duck your head in when you need a couple of minutes to warm up.   It's got all your favourite Timmy's goods, and it's actually right on your way pretty much anywhere.  You're Welcome!"}
{"text":"Busy NW Tim Hortons!!!   The line up always goes quick and they have an efficient system in place to make it seamless. Lots of cashiers.Great place to grab a quick coffee, donut or lunch. Grab to go or You can also stay since they do have tables and a snazzy fire place to sit and eat by.   Always fresh, affordable and quick no matter the time of day. Open 24/7 so if you have the urge for Timbits at midnight, perfect they are open. This location doesn't have a drive thru but lots of parking so it's still easy.  Friendly staff and allot of staff ( never under staffed). Quick service. Lots of parking!"}
{"text":"Speedy... was able to wade through a long line and grab a good cup of coffee to go... very convenient spot."}
{"text":"Donut shops are as ubiquitous in the GTA as hookers in Hollywood.  Having heard so much about Tim Horton's coffee over the years, I just had to try some.  On several trips to Toronto, I have had coffee at this particular Tim Horton's (as well as a couple of others) and I have to say my verdict:  Its just pretty good.  Really nothing special."}
{"text":"Somehow this Tim Horton's is half-baked... At least 6-7 times in the past few months when trying to get a breakfast combo they are out of hash browns - it's so consistent that it's become a joke with my wife... Amazing - who would expect to get hash browns in the morning!  I've never had this problem at any other location, but almost always do here.  Get it together folks."}
{"text":"Came to this Tims for a quick in-and-out food, especially since this location doesn't have seating areas but only standing side bars.  The line was long and the floor markings actually goes diagonal towards the doorway (which is very awkward and weird for customers). More importantly, when I got to the cash register, the cashier employee (1 of 2 staff there) had such a mean look and attitude -as if she wants to kill you- that made me feel annoyed. The way she talked was also quite rude and not friendly. On the flip side, the other staff that was making my Steak & Cheese panini, was super cheerful and happy. She was very polite too and was smiling all the way."}
{"text":"Went to Canada on a business trip with our beautifully nutty salesgirl up in the great white north.  In 2.5 days, had Tim Horton's three times and two of them in this airport.  Somewhat like a cross between a subway, Starbucks, and McDonalds - servicable, probably somewhat healthly, but definitely not the place to go on an expense account."}
{"text":"I kept seeing Tim Hortons every where. Im unsure exactly what it is but i stopped because i needed something really quick. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich as it said on the menu and it was really a soft panini with cheese in between. I also got the potato wedges and apple juice. The juice was a mini juice like the ones kids get with a happy meal and the wedges...were..... hmm not good what so ever they tasted baked. Have you ever eaten not fresh baked fries or wedges? Neither have I until now and you wont like it."}
{"text":"I know you guys are new ... but COME ON! 20 mins to get two wraps the chef had NO clue how to make them kept looking at his little cheat sheet . No potato wedges....? Then why advertise them! I think I will stick to copperpond where they actually know what there doing and I'm in and out with in 5 minutes!  Not to mention the cashier had no clue how to make a French vanilla , ring orders in ect"}
{"text":"Slow service, get my orders wrong more times than right. Coffee frequently tastes burnt.Also had an experience where my boyfriend believes his coffee was spiked here (not confirmed)."}
{"text":"This timmies is so convenient because it is so close to home but they have such horrible customer service here. They got my order wrong and when I went to complain, the manager didn't fix the situation but instead told me that I was in the wrong. Since then I've waited to go to the Tim Hortons close to work rather then stopping here. Horrible."}
{"text":"One of the worse locations for service, cleanliness and quality.  Don't  be surprised if the line is all the way out the door and they have 10 staff bumping into one another and only one cashier open.  This is a common occurrence here. Tables are rarely cleaned and the washrooms really need freshener.  The food itself isn't really food, it is made off site, shipped in and re-heated and served. This includes bacon and egg products as well as the donuts. They really shouldn't be allowed to make the claim  'Always Fresh', nothing is fresh and highly flavour enhanced for an added dose of chemicals.  One should wear safety glasses when eating a glazed donut, so much glaze it shatters when you bit into it.  Harsh I know, Tim Hortons was a gem many decades ago, what the hell happened, who knowsl   Oh, now I remember, an american took it over.lol"}
{"text":"Ok, so I am a new Yelper. I don't like to say negatives, but this got me really steamed. Went thru the drive thru Friday on our way north. OMG, 20 + min. stuck in the drive thru, and you know you can't pull out of line or drive over the curb. You are committed. This has happened to us before, just at this one location. Others are fine. Typical, either stand inside and wait, or in the drive thru, but the cars keep moving. Not this location. Won't be stopping here again any time soon."}
{"text":"It's not hard to find. It's located by a Starbucks just past gate 75. The line was pretty long when we arrived. The doughnut selection was pretty scarce. They weren't listed in English so I had to point and describe which doughnuts I wanted. The service was good and place was really busy. The maple cream filled doughnut was delicious!"}
{"text":"Wait times at this Tim Hortons are much longer than I experience at most. The last few times I have been here I've witnessed what I assume to be management or a district trainer standing behind the counter focusing on cleanliness or some type of audit that is taking staff away from serving guests. I've walked to this location twice in the last few months and both times I have spent nearly 20 minutes waiting for my order."}
{"text":"An average, tiny Tim Hortons in a nice centric location, service was fast and the place was nice and clean. My coffee was good as always :)"}
{"text":"It's almost laughable how tragically has the quality and speed of service here is every time you go in. There's always a growing line up of people and a few employees awkwardly milling around each other aimlessly. There's an almost palpable disdain for every customer that walks in and such a lackadaisical disregard for even pretending to care about their customer service jobs. And the orders are almost always invariably packed in the most illogical ways prone to leaks. It's like the dystopian customer service hell of your wildest fantasies."}

{"text":"This is a newer Tim Hortons. The staff was friendly but there weren't very many customers in the store yet the garbage bins were overflowing.   The breakfast sandwich was great. On par or even better than Mickey D's.   Once cleaned this would be one of the better Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"I donut think I can resist!  Came to Tim Hortons because I had a layover in Montreal and needed something to occupy my time so I decided to do what I do best: eat!   The line was longer than most places at the airport possibly because TH is a Canadian institution and everyone wants a taste of Canada.  I ordered the grilled chipotle chicken wrap and an old fashion glazed. I wasn't expecting to be mind blown people, this is a chain afterall.   The food was mediocre but at least I got to say I got a taste of Canada!"}
{"text":"The best and most efficient Tim's I've ever been to in the GTA. Staff is friendly and unbelievably fast without sacrificing the taste of the food. I had a $40 order and they completed it all with no mistakes and only a five minute wait. Superb."}
{"text":"Awesome and clean Tim Hortons location. Fast service. It was really packed, but lines moved quick and our order was ready in seconds (literally 7 seconds)."}
{"text":"The worst Tim Hortons in downtown, I sometimes have to get to work at 5:15 AM, there's always one and only east indian looking guy, ANYTHING this guy makes, literally EVERYTHING tastes like garbage, there are other people doing this shift when I go to them they are always pleasant and make more or less okay tasting morning sandwitches, this guy - terrible, takes 10 mins to make a sandwich, was so frustrated was looking to complain but when I had a glimpse of store manager he did not seem adequite either. EPIC FAIL for that branch, big time, I wish StarBucks was open aat 5 AM *sigh*"}
{"text":"If I wasn't addicted to caffeine and it wasn't the only Timmies drive through on my way to work I would pass it everyday. Worst service ever. Slow slow slow. And they always miss items you order so double check your order. Hope that corporate sees this and makes the owner smarten up. Looks so bad on Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"A decent dark roast coffee and extremely cheap doughnuts.   Not much else you can ask for if you need a quick snack on the run.  The service is fast amd the fact you can now use credit cards now is a huge bonus.  You can't help, but appreciate a low cost meal or snack like this once in a while!"}
{"text":"Unless you're absolutely dying for a Timmie's fix, avoid this place.....the regular Tim Horton rules don't apply.  (That or the staff is all under the influence of something).  Slow as molasses in January and certainly wearing ear plugs.  Cannot take an order correctly to save their lives.  It's like they've never been trained.....the only way you know that you're at a Tim Horton's is the sign out front and the food (when you finally get it) is the same as you'd get at a location that actually WANTS to serve you.  There are two other locations in the area:  Queen East in the Beach and the other at Leslie and Lakeshore. Go there, they actually want your business."}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry i suggest you drive to the one in Cranston... you will prob have your food quicker. Iv been there a few times( drive thru) and ordered a combo. They ring everything in seperatly which is way more expensive. When you ask them about it, no one knows what you are talking about or how to speak english. I am bocotting this Timmys. The one on 32nd is only a 5 minute drive down 12th. The manager should be asshamed & fired."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The drive-thru says shortest line but they only ever take orders from one side. Don't order food here unless you feel like waiting for 30 minutes if they even remember your order. If you order inside prepare to be ignored almost completely. I realize Tim Hortons has become a garbage place to get food in recent years but this one takes the cake in terribleness. If it wasn't in an industrial area it would go out of business."}
{"text":"This is probably my least favourite Tim Hortons. I go here cause I  live close by. They mess up my order at least 50% of the time. And many times they run out of many of the donuts or pastries. I hate ordering a combo cause the other day they didn't put in one of the wedges and I didn't notice until I got home. This is the drive thru I'm talking about. I never go in to order."}
{"text":"Not the best Timmy's on the block. They need to clean here more."}
{"text":"Worst Tim Hortons ever. We only come here for a pit stop before we go to work. Horrible service, they never get the orders right even if you slow down your speech to tell them."}
{"text":"This location has a strange two-register system... depending on when you come in the staff are either awesome or really slow."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons location is always 50/50 on their food. Once, I remember getting a meal with fries, but they ran out of fries... So they had to make a fresh batch which they said would take 5 minutes... 10 minutes pass and they completely forgot about us and the fact that we were waiting for fries..."}
{"text":"This review is mostly to prepare out of towners for what to expect. This Tim Horton's serves the McGill university students and this has pros and cons. The Pros: they will serve you in English without giving you stink-eye, and the staff are well-meaning university students, so you'll want to cut them a break. The cons: noisy, dirty, chaotic. They seem to routinely get orders wrong, so you need to check before you leave.  Other than those things, it's like any other Tim Horton's. Which is fine."}
{"text":"I thought all Timmies were pretty much alike, but this one proves me wrong. In the time I was there they were grindingly slow and didn't get a single order (including mine) correct. They appear to be short-staffed and unsupervised. And since I have visited this Tim's a few times while spending time at a local business, I feel on firm ground declaring it consistently disastrous rather than occasionally off its game.  I recommend stopping at a Tim Horton's before you get there."}
{"text":"This Tim Horton's needs more staff. When we tried to order from here there were only 2 staff working, they were out of breakfast sandwiches and the line was 1 hour long. I suppose the airport knows people will wait...unless they have to catch a flight. I wonder if anyone has missed a flight trying to get a double double.    I'm only giving it two stars because it still beats all the other garbage overpriced options at Terminal 3."}
{"text":"1 Cream, 1/2 Sugar - if you come enough times, they don't even have to ask.  Friendly Staff.  No complaints."}
{"text":"the interior and exterior was attractive. everything was clean inside and out except for their service. the staff couldnt get our order right. my mother had to go back to the drive thru cause they forgot the coffee. i thought the drive through staff was better than the people working the counter inside but apparently was not. We thought it would be a good place for breakfast but the mood was ruined when they couldnt get our order correctly 3 times."}
{"text":"New Tim Horton's upmaket cafe right at Yonge and Charles (our new hood, yeah!). I've been here twice now for coffee, the service is good and they are very speedy. Because it's the cafe they don't have the full menu range (no apple fritters) but its enough for me in the morning."}
{"text":"We were here in May 2013.  While visiting family, we took a nice walk in the neighbourhood to stretch our legs, and ended up at Timmy's. No trip to Canada is complete without a stop at Tim Hortons.  We ordered a box of timbits, coffee, hot cocoa, and a few sandwiches. The restaurant was clean, the employees were friendly, and the food was fresh and tasty.    I've only been to about five other Tim Hortons locations, so I don't have many compare this one to, but it was quite an enjoyable stop and I'll be happy to stop by here again."}
{"text":"Tims are Tims. This one is OK and seems to be a bustle with activity when I stopped here. Had a French vanilla and a breakfast sandwich. Seems like a very busy location and central on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I'll never understand the draw to Tim Horton's. Is it the poorly made coffee, the frustrating staff, the processed sandwiches or the unsatisfying taste of their donuts? I'll just never understand the allure.   I'm not picking this location out as awful, it's just near my work and I happen to frequent here with co-workers on breaks for a mid-day snack. I just don't get it. The only time I have enthusiasm for this place is the 'roll up to win' contest (which is fixed so the greatest prize you'll ever win is a free cookie), but in all honesty I just like gimmicks (rolling up the rim is wholesome fun!).   So if you like Tim Horton's, please notify me of it's popularity. I honestly don't get it."}
{"text":"So what do you do when you start commuting with the wife and you have to take a different route away from your favourite coffee place (McD)? Stop by Timmies even though it's not your first or second choice.   I don't bother with the drive-thru as its always busy. The lineup in the store can be a bit long as there's only a maximum of 2 cashiers at all time. At least the store it's one of the largest one in terms of space. It also has been renovated recently so the decor looks nice. There's also plenty of parking spaces so it shouldn't be a problem.   The reason of the 3 stars is because of service. It can be a bit of a hit and miss depending of the day. One day they go above and beyond in trying to fix a leaky coffee lid and other days, they overcharge you on a coffee and sandwich combo.   So until I start to commute solo, just have to drink their horrible coffee in the meantime.   At least I'm with good company right now..."}
{"text":"Leur service à la clientèle est  pourri.  Ils ont 3 caisses, par contre 95% du temps (quand c'est plein) ils en ouvrent qu'une seule!  C'est très sale.  C'est la pire succursale de Tim Hortons que je connaisse! Sauve-qui-peut!"}
{"text":"Very convenient location near yonge and eg subway. Service was very friendly, I immediately felt like a regular. Love how the cashier writes your name on the cup! Pricing is standard for all Tim's."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this Timmies is open at every imaginable hour of the day. I pop in here on my way to work. Grab a quick tea and/or cookie or bagel and sit myself down near the windows to keep an eye out for my shuttle bus to arrive (which stops a teeny bit south of the Tim's).  It's very clean and the staff are always very pleasant, especially for the ridiculously early hour I show up. The only bummer is that I usually arrive when they are still baking the bagels, hence i don't get one. But that's no fault of Timmies. Besides, my thighs don't need the bagel every morning..."}
{"text":"This Timmies has a great location, perfect for grabbing a cuppa when you are strolling down Roncy.  They don't have the best selection of doughnuts here, and I'm not the biggest fan of the automatic sliding door at the street entrance. But it's fine for picking up a little snack and a tea and continuing on your way."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here the other night to get a caffein fix before going to a party and we had an okay time.  The franchise is kind of small, really busy and not too clean but it was typical of a traditional Tim Horton's. I found the atmosphere a bit dark and not as bright as I would have liked.  I ordered a tea and took it to go. Let's just say this tea was piping hot and filled right to the top. I was holding it in the backseat and it proceeded to spill all over me every time my friend hit a bump. I burnt my hand and screamed. I really have no idea why they have to use water as hot at this and I would not return to buy a tea at this location.  My poor injured hand!"}
{"text":"Asked for a double toasted bagel...got a burnt one...not a good way to start morning................:("}
{"text":"Most miserable atmosphere and people working here I've ever seen in my entire life. The cashier looked like she wouldn't care if she died this instant or lowkey died in a ditch later in the week. The rest of the employees look like the possibilities of eye contact are zero because if they did you'd see the lifelessness in their eyes and then it'd be reported to their managers and then their life is over.   This review is so depressing. Just like this location. Really sad way to start a day unless you're just as miserable then at least you've got not f u c k s to give."}
{"text":"Average Tim Hortons. Service really depends on who works that day. Certain staff are pretty slow like the average Tim Hortons. And a few of the younger staff are quicker. Food wise, taste the same as all other Tim Hortons. This location however is a tad better because it is relatively cleaner than most and spacious. Located in a small plaza, not many go here so there are plenty of empty tables."}
{"text":"I went to tims off Blackfoot trail to get a cup of joe and I was in and out of there within two minutes. The staff are welcoming and very friendly. Not a fan of the parking situation but I drive a cube van so it's not easy to find suitable parking anyways. All in all I would recommend."}
{"text":"Just look at the pics and tell me if you will support TM.  They are all becoming dumps"}
{"text":"Noisy staff, poor service and food.   The place also had flies and bees inside and flies in the donut case.  We had a New Greek salad and it was horrible so had to call for the manager.  They made a new one and it was no better. Actually we are visiting from the US and this was the second time visiting a TH and for sure it was the last.   Tha food quality has gone way way down...very sad!!!"}
{"text":"Really horrible customer service. I'm sick and tired of the \"breakfast roulette\" game I play when I order my food. Most of the time my order is wrong, and working at the hospital I don't have time to go back and have them fix it. All I want is my bagel to be made properly, how I asked for it- why is that so hard? I'm tired of my food being wrong and basically inedible.  I've worked for Tim Hortons, in a far busier location, during the morning rush (5a-1p). THIS JOB IS NOT HARD AND THE EMPLOYEES HERE CONSISTENTLY SCREW UP. Don't direct complaints to the manager because he's a idiot. Go on the website and inform corporate. Avoid avoid avoid."}
{"text":"This place messed up my order too many times. How is it so hard to order a steeped tea and get a steeped tea? Not a coffee... Not a Chai tea but a mf STEEPED TEA. Imbeciles."}
{"text":"Slow service. It's the most convenient location near my work, but the wait just isn't worth it. The staff seem to doddle, as if they're not concerned by the mounting morning line up. The products are consistently Tim Hortons, but go to ANY other location if you can. I've been to a few that are exceptional."}
{"text":"A Tim's is a Tim's is a Tim's.  Nothing special except the doughnuts tasted a little stale and the coffee must have been on minute 19 of the 20 minute maximum"}
{"text":"3/30  I generally avoid a Tim Horton's for coffee for three reasons:  1) My ex-brother-in-law worked there for many years, and when we lived together, he'd bring home so much leftover Tim Horton's. Donuts, donut holes, bagels; it didn't take long to develop feelings of ultraviolence every time I saw a box of yet more Tim Horton's baked goods.  2) The location he worked at always made the most sour coffee I have ever tasted. And since TH is a chain, and chains generally try to make all their food taste the same wherever you go, I assumed this is how all TH coffee tasted. And I was perplexed as to why everyone talked about how \"a cup of Tim's is like liquid crack.\" How Canadians that had to work across the border in the US yearned for a cup of this \"liquid crack.\" All I could think of is that it tasted more like liquid FROM a crack.  3) It's the 21st century and you'd be hard pressed to find dairy alternatives for your coffee at a TH. I'm not so precious that I feel like this should be done everywhere, but for a chain, I think it's kind of a jerk move. Even if you're not vegan, so many of my friends are lactose intolerant.   ---  But I had to work with this super-friendly guy for a couple of months, and he loved his Tim's fix. All day, every day. He'd show up ready to work with me, with an extra cup of black coffee for me in his hand, and I'd smile and surreptitiously pour it down the drain and replace it with the coffee I had made. One day, we were driving around and he kept telling me how exhausted he was and needed his regular injection of Tim's. So we pulled in here, and before I could say no, he bought me a black coffee. We sat at the table and I cautiously put the cup to my lips, like a child being made to drink castor oil. Since he was staring and smiling at me, I took a sip and swallowed.  And it wasn't the worst thing in the world! In fact, it tasted downright fresh! I wouldn't go so far as to call it \"liquid crack,\" but it was definitely drinkable! And this particular Tim Horton's was extremely clean, strung-out-bum free, and the staff behind the counter: friendly!   But if I tell you all of this; this will no longer be the clean, inviting Tim Horton's with the good coffee. This will be just another jam-packed TH with an exhausted staff and sour coffee. SO I TOLD YOU NOTHING! *waves arms*"}
{"text":"After loading my stomach with too much food (and saturating it with too much oil), I more than often tame it down with something warm.   So after our overwhelming lunch the other day, we proceeded to order coffee at the Tim Horton's drive through close by. But Tim Horton let us down - our coffee tasted like water! And I was left with my overloaded belly sitting uncomfortable on a couch.   Come on Tim?! Why you slacking off? I really needed you that afternoon."}
{"text":"Its a Tim Hortons. They are everywhere in the US and Canada. If you want quick, inexpensive food and don't know where else to go for local specialities, they are easy to find and better than McDonalds."}
{"text":"Staff is lazy, never putting lids on properly. Always swearing at one another and giving wrong orders out. I've witnessed someone fall in the store because they poured water down instead of mopping properly staff just looked at the guy on the floor. Always beggars outside and sitting in the restaurant drinking alcohol.. I would give it 0 stars if I could. THIS PLACE SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN"}
{"text":"By far the worst tim Horton's in town! Bad service, poor quality and they seem to never have anything. Today they served me a burnt sandwich, it's literally half black and smells burnt."}
{"text":"This Tim Horton's consistently gets orders wrong. Workers are rude when you ask them to fix your order. Have to wait 15+ mins to get something  at lunch and then it's not right or it's missing ingredients. My friend ordered a wrap and the lettuce was soggy and discoloured. When she brought it to the attention of the workers they tried to convince her that that's just what happens when you grill it"}
{"text":"Once, the nicest guy in the universe worked here. He was all smiles, told me I was his favorite and never charged me for an extra cup to put my cup of hot tea in (they don't have sleeves in Tim Hortons, and their beverages are always nuclear to the touch!).   For that, and because they now have free Wi-Fi, this Tim's gets a 3. Otherwise, I'm not down with the fact that Tim's has zero vegan options and that their lone vegetarian option is no longer listed on the menu (though you can still order it). No dairy alternatives for your coffee or tea, either. What gives, Tim Hortons? You make it across the border, and you still can't be bothered to stock even that hideously nast vanilla soy that everyone seems to think will placate us all?   And by the way, cafés. Stop stocking that hideously nast vanilla soy milk. It's disgusting. It tastes like syrupy buttholes and hatred.   Well, actually, I don't care anymore. Because you only stock that gross vanilla soy, I've learned to appreciate a cup of black coffee.   Tangent!  The staff here is usually pretty nice, albeit rather slow on the uptake."}
{"text":"First time here and there is not much people. I ordered an iced coffee with milk. The lady gave me my order and specifically said \"your ice coffee with milk\" I assumed she got my order right as she did say so. As I started to move the drink got more white. It had way more cream in it then a regular ice coffee with cream. Tasted it and it was defiantly cream.  The line up suddenly got really long so I spoke to another staff the situation. He told me that it come with cream and added some attitude with it. Told him I asked for milk , was told it was milk but was served  cream. He repeatedly told me that it usually comes with cream but at the end handed me my coffee with milk after I stood firm."}
{"text":"The drive thru tends to be pretty quite fast  in my experience.   The in store service I found was a bit slower.   It's in a convenient location, albeit the store and seating area is a bit small.   The servers had a friendly demeanor which is refreshing to find at a Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"This one is pretty standard with the rest of them, although the only time I've been here I must have got the crankiest worker of them all...I came during a busy time and I know how stressful it can get working in the service industry when it is busy, however, I also know how to \"keep calm and carry on\". This one girl didn't.   First of all, my friends and I all ordered one after another. I figured I would probably get my order a couple minutes after they all did since we all got the same stuff. Well, they got their stuff and then went and sat down and had nearly finished their food before I had got mine. The person making food was just kind of throwing the food on the counter and then when people would ask her to repeat what it was that she had put on the counter, she got pretty annoyed and snapped at them what it was...Oh well, we all have our bad days, this girl could have just been have a really bad day, or maybe she's been replaced since then.  All in all, it's the same as any other Tims! Pretty clean, just not a lot of parking I found when I went."}
{"text":"It really depends on what time you come to this location that will determine if you have good service or not. They have their best drive they staff on during the morning rush. While I lineup tosses the entire parking lot, they are efficient and quick. I usually get just a coffee, but sometimes get a breakfast sandwich too. I've never had a cold breakfast sandwich yet. Sometimes they do forget to put the sweetener in my coffee or it is brunt tasting, but more often than not, my order is correct and the coffee is decent.   If you coming at the lunch hour be prepared for chaos. There are two high schools in the area that use this location as their hang out spot. The lineups are long and all the seats are taken. The early morning staff are long gone and have been replaced with a much slower staff. When I do have the patience to battle the crowds, I have gotten a decent ham and cheese sandwich. The ingredients always taste fresh and the sandwiches are made to order.   Compared to other Tim's locations in the area, they are really good. You can't do much about the long lines as they are on the outskirts of a subdivision and the most convinent coffee drive thru on route to the highway. I'll continue to come to this location. Well, maybe not at lunch hour!"}
{"text":"This is a very convenient location. It's directly across from the GO Station and close to the QEW. The drive thru has always been a nigntmare, so recently they have put up a partition so the line doesn't flow out onto the road and blocking traffic. It has made for better flow of traffic despite being a little tricky to get into.   They do not serve plain timbits which is a bit of a let down since I periodically like to get one for my dog. They do sometimes give me a free sour cream glazed if I happen to run into a \"real dog person\" at the drive thru window.   While the staff is always friendly, I often get burnt coffee from this location which is always super disappointing when I take my first sip half way to Burlington on my way work.   I actually go out of my way now to avoid this location due to the awkward drive thru and burnt coffee, but it is convenient that they are open 24hrs. Makes the extra early mornings a little better."}
{"text":"Glad they have a parking lot, though a drive-thru after their renovations would have been awesome.  It's a bit better than the one in Parc Ex, but the clientele still feels sketchy, so I mostly take it to go. Same food that's under-rwhelmed you from coast to coast, I eat there as a last resort as there are not too many options at 4AM"}
{"text":"Why I don't like this particular Tim Hortons:  1) My debt card usually doesn't work there, yet it works fine everywhere else.  2)  rarely have the French onion soup available. Granted, that might not be particular to this location.  3) I've seen a group of suspicious looking and sounding people in here several times. (That's all I'll say).  4) I tend to have to repeat my order several times."}
{"text":"I pretty much only hit this place when I'm with the Hubster, as he is a coffee drinker and I am not.   It's quite busy and there's usually a lineup at all hours of the day. There can also be some sketchy people in the place at times. The service is quick enough and very friendly (even in the face of overt sketchiness). There is limited parking on the premises and often people will double-park as they're getting their coffee fix for the day. I've had their breakfast sandwiches, which are actually pretty good. So basically, they're your standard Tim's with a bit of a rough edge."}
{"text":"Looks like this location gets really busy since it's downtown and across from McGill.  They didn't get my order right.  I ordered a coffee and tea, but they gave two coffees and a quart of milk (huh?).  The doughnuts are great, like at other Timmy's."}
{"text":"Talking about Tim Hortons, this one is one of the best I have ever been. The space is big and well cleaned. Workers here are nice and service is fast and good. Since it is near the place I work, I usually get my first cup of coffee here."}
{"text":"I don't drink coffee so I came in for a breakfast sandwich which they managed to screw up the order after I repeated myself 3 times! I guess customer service sucks at all Tim Horton's locations!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful.  They're rude to you, don't care about their jobs.  Never and I repeat NEVER get your order right.   10 people working here and not one can get to a till until i'm too pissed off to order.  I will not go here again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and oddly enough, both times were to meet someone I was buying something from on Kijiji/Craigslist. These times were years apart and the location was suggested by the sellers. But I digress.  This appears to be a good meeting spot because it's right at a Go Train station and is also easily accessible by car. It's pretty clean and service is fine. Nothing particularly great or bad about this place at all."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for Tim Hortons, which I'd heard and believed to be a Canadian staple. My latte was good, but not great. The service was alright--not very friendly and outgoing, even though the line was pretty short (in my opinion) for a Sunday morning.  The breakfast sandwiches looked good, however, and I liked the maple bagel.  Great location on a main street in the heart of Montreal right near Concordia University. Large, clean space, as many other reviewers have mentioned."}
{"text":"Had an X-large coffee ($2) and a cheese danish ($1.67). Coffee was good and huge. Food certainly hadn't been cooked that morning, but tasted good enough. A little difficult to understand what the attendant was saying in english, but got everything right. All around a good place and worth going back."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and put my order in.  Then when i went to the window they said they were out of muffins, hashbrowns and egg....then why would you sell it to me. Everytime i come here it happens.  They never know what they have in stock everytime and the employees are very unprofessional sometimes. I went to another timmies down the road and they have never had a problem with my order.  Not once. They need to step up their game."}
{"text":"My client wanted to go here for lunch. I was ordering for him and then she gave me the total. I asked if it was okay if I placed an order as well. I asked her if she was in a rush, there was no line up. I did not enjoy feeling rushed."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for any type of good marketing campaign and given that this place has advertisements in the metro and on TV I was dying to try their Philly Steak Sandwich.  The drawing point was their \"Canadian beef\" which I bought hook, line, and sinker.  Average tasting sandwich.  Personally I prefer the USA's philly wannabe sandwich any day over this one.  But all in all, not bad."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect except they don't have chocolate chip cookies and one time I asked for a drink that is usually served warm iced and the workers seemed confused. Just add ice cubes! Other than that they work fast and the drinks are good so yeah"}
{"text":"The service can be pretty slow at times.All in all, I still spend far too much time at this place. Who doesn't  love some timmys"}
{"text":"...finally a drive thru close enough to stop at on my way to the DVP southbound. easy enough to get to, no weird entries and exits, and the staff is coherent (surprise!) and very friendly. my order hasn't been wrong yet as i continue to cross my fingers!"}
{"text":"At pretty much any big box coffee place in Toronto, 5 minutes on the rocketman timer until your next TTC transit piece is plenty enough time to get your coffee and get out and still catch that streetcar or bus, regardless of the line. Especially now that they all have pay pass.   And yes, this applies to the starbucks at 1 Queen East at 8:55! This applies at the Tim's at Queen and Bathurst or the McDonalds at King and Bathurst. 5 minutes is plenty to get your brew and catch dat' ride.   So when I had 5 minutes to get an extra large black, with one person in front of me already halfway through ordering theirs, I didn't think it'd be a big problem. And I know that was the extent of it - they have those screens now. And this team member was rocking their own entire galley behind them to prep drinks, this was not a traffic issue. Anyways: had to bail sans-beverage. This location is slllllowwwwww. Seemed to be the universal issue in there at 9:40. It was a little busy, but nowhere near genuine downtown core busy - get it together!!  Update: okay, now have managed to actually get food out of this location twice. Honestly pretty out to lunch. You have no seating. Everything you sell is going to be to go. Multiple cups? They have to go in trays. Hot beverages? Your cups are absolute shit, you started making sleeves for a reason. Food items all need go bags. They are so slow because everyone has to go back to the counter and interrupt another team member to complete the order."}
{"text":"It's so funny seeing people complain about lines. Sorry you are not the only human in the world who wants coffee lol. Learn some patience or just make a freakin coffee at home..honestly I work retail and so many grown adults act like tantrum-y children Anyways. This location was great for me :) friendly staff and my food tasted great. Sure may be lineups but that is just part of life!"}
{"text":"This was a fairly average Timmy's, which is a good thing. The service was quick, polite and accurate. The washrooms were clean. All-in-all... it was a good visit. The parking lot could cause issues the way the drive through is laid out when it gets busy but that is just nitpicking."}
{"text":"A small but fairly typical Tim Horton's. The server was perfectly friendly and definitely did his best to meet all my needs. The coffee was a bit strong but with only one person behind the counter it was understandable."}
{"text":"Another Tim Hortons.  Fast service, good coffee, and i tried one of those oreo donuts that give you instant sugar gratification.  This is what i expect from Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"You can't hate on this Timmies- it has all the quintessential qualities needed for a student in this area:  -open 24hours -so close to campus buildings you can catch free wifi -bakery on site so you can get delicious FRESH treats (which is not so for soo many timmies) -big location with great seating options on a busy street- feels less liek a gross tim hortons and more like a regular coffee shop for people watching -fast service- one of the major locations so they have a line of tills ready to serve -literally ten steps from the st. george subway  let's face it.  I hate tim horton's, and so do you.  But if you must go, this location makes it a little less painful with fresh boston creams = )"}
{"text":"Bitchy and uptight customer service, staff yelled at me repeatedly while i tried to decide. I felt harassed and didnt order what I wanted, would not go this location again."}
{"text":"I really really wish the U.S had Tim Hortons. They don't even compare to Dunkin. The coffee is fresh and strong ( not watered down) for really cheap prices. My favorite is the cappuccino ice and tim bits. Each donut is coated with the prefect amount of sugar glaze and it is just perfection. Even though i was only in Canada for 4 days, I had tim horton everyday during those days. I really wanted to bring it back home with me to new york lol"}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas un habitué des Tim Hortons, mais je vais suivre l'avis de pas mal de yelpeurs car c'était aussi mon ressenti ... le service est limite lamentable ... lamentablement long, lamentablement attardé (faut répéter 5 fois ce que l'on veut), lamentablement sale (l'endroit n'est vraiment pas nickel)...  Alors est-ce que c'est une habitude chez Tim Hortons ? Pour le reste, ça fait son job, des cafés corrects, des pâtisseries pleine de gras et de sucre, on a l'impression de sucer de la couenne au sucre ... moins cher qu'un Starbucks, mais moins bon aussi : )"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, it's Tim Hortons.  But that's OK.  It beats the hell out of Second Cup, and doesn't pretend to be better than it is.  The coffee is lousy, the donuts are pretty good.  You're overpaying, but where aren't you in this country?"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most efficient Tim Horton's locations I've ever been to. I stop in at least once a week for an extra large steeped tea and an everything bagel, double toasted with cheddar cheese and butter (if you haven't tried that combination yet, I highly recommend it)!  The service is always fast, the staff are generally friendly or at the very least quick, and the store is kept in good (and clean) working order. If you need a Timmy's fix, this one's a safe bet."}
{"text":"They just refused to take roll up the rim winners    Ya they were worn in our pockets but they tried to tell us the stuff we got from roll up the rim is from last year.   Yes they do not have honor.  That was a customer disaster and the accusation of wrong doing is insulting."}
{"text":"I usually don't do coffee and I also don't do drive through, but I was doing a coffee run and drive through seemed to be the way to go.  First of all, getting into the drive through is kind of confusing. There's a place where you can line up, but it's interrupted by a lane for flow-through traffic and... well I'm not explaining it very well because I still don't fully understand it. I had to back up once or twice before I found the entry to the lineup.   Once I was in the lineup, things moved pretty quickly. The ordering box was easy to understand and I got my order about a minute after I put it in. Their Pay Pass thingie wasn't working, but I was able to pay with my credit card the regular way.   Service was friendly, quick and the lady at the window exclaimed \"You're so cute!\" after I got my order which really made my day."}
{"text":"Great service in the weekday mornings!!! The staff are familiar with you. However the reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the weekend staff tend to screw up my coffee."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours. For a crowded place the service is swift and courteous. The drive-thru is a double lane and for all the times I've visited I think the order got mixed up just once and I can positively say that can be blamed on new staff. So yeah, great coffee and no complaints!"}
{"text":"Famous Tim Hortons location frequented by local celebrity Ed Burnett, Joel Young, Mike Holman and the rest of the boys who were friends of Ed Burnett. Ed would share stories about having this be the morning ritual where he'd meet his childhood, lifelong friends and get some coffee, donuts, read the paper, people-watch and shoot the breeze with his closest pals. On June 25th, 2018 we will have a tribute to Ed Burnett, who sadly passed away last weekend, on Fathers Day. Join in our circle of friends and say hello to our great circle of friends. You'll be Ed's newest friend. God bless, Ed. You are missed. Keep the coffee warm up there...we'll be there soon enough. Cheers."}
{"text":"Quick service, standard tasting food. Nothing exceptional about this Timmies over other ones."}
{"text":"It's just like any other Tim Hortons. Gets pretty busy in the morning but they handle the line pretty well"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick meal and quiet environment to get some work done. While I didn't have an interaction long enough to get a clear snapshot of customer service, all I can say is get rid of the reusable cutlery and use only disposable ones if they can't be washed properly.  Unfortunately, my cutlery was sticky to use, and while the staff did not give me a hard time when I asked for a new set to use (she gave me plastic cutlery the second time around), I would've at least expected to hear an apology.  Hmmm...upon some observation around the food prep station, I suppose they could use a bit of a clean up (especially when you have 3 staff at the location)..."}
{"text":"Friendly fast and convenient.  My go to Tims. Clean bathrooms and looks great since the renovation."}
{"text":"What a horrible service! My server was in the daze. When I was ordering, she just walks away in the middle of my my order to throw some papers. She comes back, makes me repeat my order three times. After payment, she doesn't give my receipt, so I take it myself. Then she spills my a coffee a bit, making my cup sticky. I tell her my cup is sticky; she gives a sleeve. By end of this, I got frustrated and told her service is horrible. She walks away again, and the manager starts defending her that she doesn't speak English... I told her I spoke in French, then she tells me she understands much. I will fill the survey about their horrible service."}
{"text":"Food is always burnt (even when asking for lightly toasted) rude service. They constantly give attitude and never get orders right. The hash browns also taste like complete crap! Would never recommend this place. If you like rude and ignorant workers come, if you don't go somewhere else. Trust me"}
{"text":"Staff are always friendly and really quick service here! Especially during rush hour in the morning when everyone is rushing and grumpy. They still serve with a smile!"}
{"text":"Drive-Thru: I may be a heretic on this one, but I have been a regular on weekday mornings for many months running, and the worst I can say is that, yes, it's a very busy drive-thru - especially when their electronic payment systems are down, which has been a couple of times.  Having said that - they lost the last star.  As for the rest - the regular staff are wonderfully friendly and efficient.  The amount of traffic they process just before 9:00 a.m. on weekdays is phenomenal, and yes, Nahid is an awesome staff.  The couple of times the electronic payment systems were down, I either got a voucher for a free coffee, or (perhaps because I am a regular and it's just the extra-large coffee?), on the house.  I don't mind the wait because I actually look forward to the friendly service, and most of all, the coffee ALWAYS TASTES GOOD - something you can't say for all the franchise locations. Eat-In: Have been in a couple of times over the lunch hour.  Still usually busy, and the staff aren't as on the ball as the drive-thru morning regulars.  On the other hand, I've never had my order messed up, as is inevitable sooner or later at most locations.  Wi-Fi works well.  Good comfy chairs and fireplace area, and the tables along the large windows are great for natural light.  Can be a little crowded and noisy but hey that's the hallmark of a good business."}
{"text":"Great location, not just real estate-wise (which is also true).  Came in at 10:45 on a Sunday morning.  The space has some window seating and a few tables, not a big location and no comfy chairs/fireplace like some of the newly-renovated ones, but it's clean, and the staff were quick and on the ball, even though it was a weekend.  I only had to ask for my receipt once and the coffee was spot on.  The napkin dispensers were visible, and full!  Washrooms were also clean and both the hot and cold water feeds for the faucet worked, with decent water pressure!  No burnt, frozen, or barely washed hands!  When we returned from our outing at 2:00 p.m., I was still thinking about how good this morning's coffee tasted, so I came back in for another.  I also ordered a fruit chill and immediately was asked whether I'd like a tray for the more-than-one beverage order.  Coffee tasted just as good the second time around (and the washroom was still clean, too).  (Forgot to ask BF what he thought of his fruit chill but no complaints so I figure it was fine.)  If I wanted to be really picky, I'd minus a star for the lack of upper scale decor that the newly renovated locations have, but given what they have to work with, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the efficiency and proper coffee-brewing by the staff earn it the full star rating, at least for today."}
{"text":"I've been twice and regretted it both times. Firstly, it's almost impossible to get in - it's VERY busy on that block and it's in a gas station. No parking.....if you manage to get in, get ready to line up for very old coffee. Ask for a cup of tea and you'll get the weirdest look you've ever gotten.   LOL I'm not sure if I've had bad luck the times I've been but although I speak both English and French, I had a hard time making myself understood to the people that were working there. Oh well.    With all the coffee places in the neighbourhood, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've worked a couple of doors down from this location for a few years, so I go here often. My advice is to go elsewhere if you can. The service here has always been a bit choppy, but in the last year it's crashed to the point of near incompetence. I can only assume that layoffs have caused shift cutbacks and the dismissal of more expensive, experienced staff. The remainder is a skeleton crew of trainees who become overwhelmed at sandwich orders and are constantly perplexed by their own cash registers.  While this is annoying on most occasions, it becomes completely intolerable during the student rushes. A nearby school ensures that every weekday at lunch and 3pm, the small store is packed full of shrill, obnoxious, half-stunned kids. They don't know how to order, and the staff doesn't know how to deal with any snag ups or special requests. It would be funny to watch if I wasn't in a rush."}
{"text":"Worst time Hortons, dirty, line up so long, been here 34 minutes to get a coffee, two people working here on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"Service is usually slow and the staff seem rather unorganized. Better off going to the Starbucks in the chapters just down the road"}
{"text":"Lets just say this place gets an interesting crowd. Its well maintained all things considered and the staff are relatively polite and fast. They burn the coffie and and the fellow patrons will bother you with absolute non-sense. It can be either annoying or hillarious Either way inspite of loving the place it is a dump and so I must give it the stars it deservs."}
{"text":"I love Tim Horton's and we should have eaten here.  I love Tim Horton's and we should have eaten here.  Repeat.   Since we had a four hour layover at Lester B, we mistakenly tried the burger place next door. I'll let you read my review of that place...   http://m.yelp.com/biz/true-burger-mississauga?skip_bridge=true  But just before our flight as the lines subsided a little (only twenty ahead of me), I had to stop by and grab a large coffee. Mind you the Green Mermaid was empty the whole night. No one on line. LOL  But I had to have a cup of one of Canada's best exports and it hit the spot.   We had our first cup twenty years ago in Brampton and were hooked. When we use to travel to Ann Arbor for a youth hockey tournament, heck for any reason at all, we stopped in the Wendy's/ Tim Horton's combo and grabbed a few 16 ounce tins to take home. That's how much we enjoyed our Tim Horton's experience.   If you like that Quincy Mass place, then you'll love Tim's as we do. Try it.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for 3 years now almost 5 days a week before work and weekends. Today was the final straw. I order the same thing I always do(coffee and a strudel). i waited for my coffee but the lady behind me got her's first, practically at the same time she ordered. No one was making mine. They all walked away. from their station. When I asked where mine coffee was, they asked what I ordered. I asked if  I was not special and she looked at me like I was retarded. I had to tell the manager that I am a paying customer and should of received my coffee before the guest after me.  They do this all time.   I am a little insulted that after 3 years and the same people serving me that they treated me like this.  I felt like the guest behind me was more important.  POOR POOR POOR."}
{"text":"I stop here on my way to catch a my bus stop down to New York, I had about an hour to kill, this was about 11pm. So it was kind of dead, few employees but service didn't lack."}
{"text":"This more convenience then preference, small store, lines are always a mess, take a bit more time. Sometime I wonder why I don't wait and just go to one at Richmond and sherbourne"}
{"text":"Small but nice, better seating since it renovation, can be a bit of wait depending on the time of day but it's alright. The wait is never too bad even with a line.  It's quick and convenient.  Thou most of the time I use the place to sit down and have coffee with my brother or I'm stopping on my way home so I'm not in  rush but service is still quick."}
{"text":"To start things off this Tim Hortons is INSIDE the Esso gas station but is not manned by the Esso staff.  It is a full service Timmy's as far as they have sandwiches, bagels, donuts etc.  It's not just donuts and coffee.  There are several high top tables as well but this is a very compact workspace.    Short counter,  so short basically there's only room for one tray.  They have a drive through and really this station is busy with people getting gas, coming in and paying and then you have a car wash, vacuum station, etc.  Not very much parking because of the On the Road for Esso, the gas station and the Tim Hortons.  The Timmy's is busy.  The line is moving sure but it's a line.    It is impressive still that this tiny booth in the corner of the Esso has a full blown Tim's.  The donut options are a little limited though but it's a Tim's."}
{"text":"This Timmy's is located on the arrivals level (gates) in the domestic section in Terminal 3 post security.  After the post security of the B and C gates of Terminal 3 and just to the left there's a Timmy's that seems to be more organized than the Tim's in Terminal 1.  I admin I rarely go to Terminal 3 as opposed to 1 so I can't ever say I remember coming to this particular Tim's before.  The one thing you'll notice that it's quite busy with 3 separate lines going but no lines in particular for just beverages so all three are full service (food and all).  The pickups seem to all take place at the right side and that area can get a bit uncomfortably packed if many are waiting for their orders.  They're calling our orders by number for pickup so try to remember your number or check your receipt for the last 2 digits.  As always I'm no fan of Tim's breakfast sandwiches.  Everything just tastes reheated and doesn't seem as fresh as A&W or McD's for quick breakfasts.  Their coffee is ok.  They don't seem to have their own seating so if you head down to where the other places are (the area that looks like a food court) there may be seating there.  It seems the gates at Term 3 don't have side tables in the seating area like they do in T1 so eating there will be more difficult with no place to really down your drink except for the floor if you have to resort to that."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons is one of the few Canadian chain restaurants.  They are great with consistency and speedy customer service.    This location has a drive through, and there's a Gas Station/ Couche Tard across the street.  The place is Brand-New so its clean and the turnover of people flows throughout the day.      My fiancé loves the  Extra Large Tim Hortons coffe, and for 60 additional cents - a shot of espresso.  I tried it and wow!! It not only wakes you up with a slap on the face, but  makes the cold winter a little more bearable the next time you have to face it.       We got to try different paninis I had the Chipotle Turkey Panini : Smoked turkey, tomatoes, red onions and processed mozzarella cheese and chipotle sauce. It was tasty, they toast the Panini on a press and it comes out warm and crunchy with melted cheese. It would've been better if it was fresh turkey not sliced processed stuff.      My fiancé had the Tuscan Chicken Panini : its seasoned white chicken strips, tomatoes, red onions and processed mozzarella cheese with a creamy sundried tomato sauce. Yummy with the crunch and melted cheese.     The Paninis can come in a Trio with a drink and a Soup it makes a fantastic, smart deal.  We tried the Chicken Noodle soup.  Chicken broth with chunks of tender white chicken, carrots, red peppers, peas, onions and bow tie pasta. Yummy soo good on a cold day and does taste home made in a fresh way.   There's a changing variety of soups at Tim Hortons If you order for eating in, they give you real bowls, and cutlery, and plates for the Panini, cups for your drinks.    Also a big fan of the multigrain Bagel with Cream Cheese no butter. It's unlike the Montreal bagel,  but is light and crunchy, they toast it and cut it in half with the cream cheese scooped on the plate.  It's a great energy snack.   I don't need to comment on the delicious pastries.. They have a variety of Donuts like with Maple Glaze, and muffins and cookies , they can also heat it up for you.       Great value for a healthy fast food, and Timmy Ho's has a place in most Canadian Hearts I will be back and other locations too!!"}
{"text":"For me, Timmies is a childhood memory. It kept me up in college, fed me on my commute to high school and embodies hockey and Canada. These are some of the reasons that make Tim Horton's and a visit home perfect!"}
{"text":"I come here during my lunch almost everyday. There is always a line up and way under staffed. I ask for lightly buttered and it is anything but lightly buttered. The place all the butter on the bottom part and none on the top. The staff is generally bad."}
{"text":"I heart Tim Hortons!  I know they've opened a few in the States, but the ones in Canada are my favorite. The quality of their products are much better there.  My cousins and I are obsessed with the Iced Capp and Timbits. The first thing on our agenda once arriving to Toronto is to grab Tim Hortons. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but something about the Iced Capp keeps me coming back for more. That stuff is madd addicting.  Their Maple Dip donut is so flipping good. Especially when it comes out fresh. Prices are reasonable. Seating is available and employees were quick.   I love this location because I can get my Iced Capp fix one more time before getting on the plane. I also appreciate that I can grab a bunch of goodies for family and friends, while waiting for my flight."}
{"text":"I live maybe a 3 wood away from this place but I come here only about once a month or more of you include drive throughs . I'm not going to lie I don't like this place but it is the closest place to grab a coffee and my wife likes it so I'm usually driving through.   They used to have a Cold Stone and then they took it away. So many times the store front has been hit by cars they finally had to install concrete pillars to protect it. The drive through is stupid because there's usually only one line but maneuvering into line in a packed parking lot it just ridiculous.   It's hardly ever kept tidy in the dining area, it's sometimes faster to go inside than the drive through and it's mostly inconsistent.   The food here is not great, it never was. I think their breakfast sandwiches seem dry and I only like the bagels.  The drive through entrance is at the eastern side of the building.  There is a driveway that goes around the building but the line for the drive through illogically goes through the middle of the strip mall parking lot causing all sorts of logistical issues at times.    Drivers coming from the Eringate entrance either go around the building from behind clockwise and turn right into the drive through (180 degrees) or go counter and wait while the main line coming from the east side (through the mall parking lot) allows them in OR they drive through the mall and get in the main line.  Confusing?  See for yourself..."}
{"text":"Great location & good customer service. We had very good time sitting inside chatting with friends and off course medium double double in this cold weather !!!"}
{"text":"Came during lunch period and didn't realize that this Tim Hortons would be PACKED!  Located on a small street - right next to Tenichi if you know where that is (a little shy of McCowan/Sheppard) - this Tim Hortons was just like any other Tims. Except this is probably one of the better locations I've seen with tons of seating and washrooms.   They had a $5.99 combo going on where you pick any wrap/sandwich and it comes with salad or soup of your choice! I went with the Grilled Cheese and Cream of Broccoli soup. Their other soup choices were Chilli and Chicken Noodle Soup.  I've had the Cream of Broccoli soup from Fairview's Tim Hortons and it was SO watery... it was pretty disgusting. I was pretty reluctant to get soup again because of that experience but I was feeling cold so decided to give it another shot and this Tim Hortons redeemed their quick soups for me :) . It isn't as creamy (Im not complaining, its Tim Hortons for gods sake) as I would like but I still enjoyed it very much!! It was hot and it hit the spot with several broccoli pieces in the soup as well.   The Grilled Cheese was yummy but nothing special except for the size. It was super huge - I didn't expect it to be that big! And I couldn't finish it :( !   With this combo, the Grilled Cheese was the cheapest thing on the menu - and in hindsight, I shouldhv picked something else but it was still yummy and I enjoyed it :) !  Service was fast and quick, maybe because it was during a busy lunch time. My cashier was nice and friendly.. when asked questions she responded with knowledge and she also informed me that my soup won't come with the complimentary bread due to the combo (or something??). Also, instead of just putting orders on the counter, the girl made sure that people got the right orders before handing it off - which really helps in a busy lunch period."}
{"text":"During part of the late morning rush but service was fast and efficient. Wasn't quite sure about the \"Farmer's Breakfast\" and the lady who attended me answered my questions properly - apparently there is an option for bacon instead of sausage(?)  There's quite a number of sitting space here but often gets taken up by old folks with their coffee and newspapers.  The \"Farmer's Breakfast\" is similar to the Morning McWrap from McDonalds with the exception of McDs's bigger portion. Nevertheless, I still got full of it without ordering a combo as well! Although near the end, my pieces were falling apart within the burrito. Hashbrown was slightly hard on the edges but other than that, it was fine.  There aren't much tissues to grab except the ones they provide on the counter which I don't like :/ ... Maybe people abuse it too much."}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times since it opened. The constant issues it has is lack of cleanliness and the staff never seem to be trained correctly or are lacking in some way. Orders are frequently wrong even though they ask you to repeat your order at least 3 times! Someone needs to step up and bring this location to an acceptable standard."}
{"text":"I love timmies but this place is probably the slowest I've ever been to. I've seen places with multiples lines just like this branch but haven't seen it crawling like this though. boarding in 5 minutes and only one person moved on my line. ugh."}
{"text":"The staff is so rude, I never go to this tim hortons just because of the it."}
{"text":"Always fresh and hot! Adore pastry there! Can't say that I'm a big fan of their coffee, but moka seems to be quite drinkable."}
{"text":"My husband loves Tim Horton's. I fail to see the love. I think it's a good comparison to Dunkin' Donuts. Tim's has decent coffee and donuts. The walk-up window, though, is key especially on busy weekends."}
{"text":"This is a small TIm Horton right off the corner of Spadina and Bloor, so I give it a point for being close to subway, I actually did grab a coffee on my way back to Spadina.  It is organized where only one line is possible which is nice but there are only two cash. I find most Tim Horton all the same, but I dont know what it was but the guy who I had order from 1) didnt even notice I was in line till his coworker pointed it out, and 2) i had to keep repeating my order (maybe he has a hearing issue I dont know)  His coworker ended up hearing my order and made the coffee  It was alright coffee, just not best ordering experience but not the worse, hence the 2,  1 is for down right terrible and counter productive service."}

{"text":"Hey,  So, this review is for Timmies in my hometown of Saint Sauveur. It might seem kinda strange to review a chain, but each location is different.   This is an AWESOME Tim Horton's. I think it's one of the few I've seen that has a patio. That might not seem like much, but when the weather is nice, which it has been the last few months, it's neat to be able to wake up in the warm sunshine eating some oatmeal or having a refreshing iced lemonade.  This Timmies shares a building with Harvey's which is really convenient, because if you feel like having a Tim's coffee, a donut and some onion rings, then go for it! How about a cheeseburger, hash browns and a donut? Why not? You can also have...well, I'm not gonna go through every possible combination...you get the idea.   The people that work there are nice. They joke with me and don't mind that my French is not great. Having grown up here, the thing to remember about Quebec is that if you TRY to speak French, most people will be really friendly about it. If you don't care, nobody else will either. Just a matter of respect.   5 stars all the way baby!"}
{"text":"How fast can you say drive through? This place is amazing for that, I've never been inside but those drive through people have super powers on how they get through the line.  Learn other Timmies, learn!"}
{"text":"Great service during the week - quick and my orders are always bang-on. The ladies are nice.   I avoid this place on the weekends as it is often extremely slow and they don't make my simple order properly."}
{"text":"Slowest drive through time ever! always messes my order up:( and they over cook the chocolate chip cookie so it's hard and the Nutella croissant barely has anything in it !!"}
{"text":"Nice 24/7 Timmy. I'm usually here ordering their infamous chicken wrap from the drive thru when I'm hungry and it's too late to go anywhere else. Sometimes I dine in. Your usual Tim Horton's with it's usual menu items. Place is renovated recently, not crowded, comfy chairs.  Also this is the perfect location for picking up people especially those coming from the GO train as no one can miss it."}
{"text":"Came here to try out their new dark roast coffee. It tasted horrible. Not sure if it's this location or every Timmy's (Edit: turns out it's every Timmy's)  I tried their wedges. They are alright. Place is packed yet clean. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Canadian institution. Fast and friendly. Closest coffee to my hotel. Second time today. Definitely prefer it to DD in the States."}
{"text":"Would it be an airport in Canada if it didn't have a Tim Horton's? Nay, I say. It would not. And so, in the grand tradition of things in airports not being super awesome, I feel that way about this Timmy's.   Now, it should be known that I've been to precisely one other TH in my life, so I don't have much to compare it to. But Tim Horton's, or Starbucks, or any other restaurant or cafe or airport stop have the same functional needs, and there are a few pluses and minuses here.  First, it was fast. I had a breakfast sandwich and it got to me quickly. That's a positive. It wasn't slammed, but there was a steady line, so they can handle at least a small crowd. However, the layout is really bad. It looks like you can order on separate ends of a counter, and then you just sort of wait and mill about in the seating area waiting for your food. It's awkward, and people pile up, and you don't hear when your name is called. It's just a bad layout.  Still, it's pretty cheap. The food is... well... fast food from an airport. But it will do."}
{"text":"3 stars.  Fast service (can serve a line of 30-40 in less than 10 minutes), your normal Timmy's food."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons is great, this location had okay service, not the friendliest. Doughnuts were delicious and iced coffee hit the spot. In a good location so easy to get to. Wait time was probably average for this type of establishment."}
{"text":"My last review wasn't fair, for the most part they are quick and get my order right. Thou there is usually one maybe two ladies working so if there is a line. Might be a while but they are trying  My last review with hot chocolate was an isolated case"}
{"text":"Small, one line system which make it more organized,  busy alot of teens and kids, the parking lot is a mess. meh not that good but it was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"I always find it difficult to get a table here. Lots of people with laptops, or lingering over their ice capps, annoying when I go there for a meal and need to sit down - not a lot of seating available."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try it on my way back to the States and because I wanted something cheaper than Starbucks. Well you get what you paid for. I waited in line for 20 minutes and then another 10 for my food. Got to my gate and opened my bag and ended up with a cold smashed sausage egg and cheese croissant without the egg (guess they forgot) and a cold hashbrown. The only reason I did not go back and return this travesty is because my plane boarded shortly after and I was starving.The Black coffee was the only thing they got right."}
{"text":"Classic Tim's.  Nothing good but nothing bad.  What you would expect from Tim's.  They have wi-fi now too"}
{"text":"Morning staff is friendly and positive (NOT the evening staff that's for sure) but they pretty much never get the orders correct and do not even use the receipt number calling system. You can't yell about my wrap being ready when I ordered a sandwich and expect me to notice and come pick it up after telling me to wait for my number to be called... That and the cramped space causes all sorts of confusion. Only reason it's not one star is because they have soup and I've been to bigger Tims that didn't so at least you can get soup if they manage to understand your order."}
{"text":"I strongly recommend the steeped tea and the Farmer's wrap. The wrap itself was a little dry, however everything inside went well together.   I like the container that it comes in, it makes the whole eating experience less messy!  Rating: 3.5"}
{"text":"This is one my fav Timmies especially because of the service. The staff is so polite and they always listen to your order with patience. I have never had an issue here which is a lot that I can say compared to the other Tim Hortons in the area. The staff at Tim Hortons on Pegasus Rd NE and Saddleridge are incredibly rude and they just have no customer service. They always act like they are doing the customers a favour for listening to them which is incorrect. Which is why I always go here even if it isn't the closest location. Keep it up and honestly being polite can go a long way. =)"}
{"text":"One of the better locations I've been to, this Tim Horton's location caters mainly to the work crowd working the Bloor Street East area. Large dining space, great customer service, and multiple cashiers make this former Second Cup location turned Tim Horton's a great spot to have a small discussion or lunch.  Only negative aspect is that they do not accept credit cards with the exception of MasterCard. I spoke with corporate about this policy and they informed me that each franchise owner make these decisions on their own part, therefore if you're coming here make sure to have cash or a MasterCard on hand to make your purchase."}
{"text":"Good place to get your coffee and breakfast (or lunch) on the go, although spacious inside, there is NO seating at this location. While there is standing tables where some can rest their drink or meal, the lack of sit-down tables is a negative thing.  Service is great, location is convenient (across the street from the Sherbourne subway station), and hours are great. If it wasn't for the lack of tables, I would have ranked it higher."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Tim Hortons I have ever been to. My order was totally screwed up. Twice. What a waste of time and money. Had to send it back to re-do, then just left without any food. Minimum wage rise should come with raised expectations."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was welcomed by an extra friendly cashier. If it wasn't for him I would have gave this place 1 star. It's small, packed, loud, with no outlets to plug in. On the bright side, the WiFi was working. I ordered a black dark roast coffee because there was a TV screen that kept advertising it as \"Rich flavor\" but it tasted more diluted than the usual Timmy's."}
{"text":"Seriously wtf....these things are worse than American starbucks in every corner in e USA.... Coffee actually really good.  It's like a mix of dunkin donuts and burger king...."}
{"text":"There's a tim hortons Inside the via rail station and this one. I can't tell you how happy I was when I found this one. It's closer to my work and is less crowded. Since the underground one connects to place ville marie, there's always huge lineups of people taking the train, going to work, and shopping.  This location makes me feel like I have my very own private Tim Hortons.  I only knocked off a star because it still remains a Tim Hortons. Meh-ish doughnuts, ok food menu, decent drinks and because I've gotten a few ice caps here and for some reason they're always a bit too watery so I had to start asking them to leave it in the machine a bit longer."}
{"text":"Oooh this location was fancy schmancy. After a late lunch, we walked up and down the street but couldn't find a place for tea/coffee that weren't filled with people in front of their glowing laptops or had enough seating.  I would normally avoid a Tim's especially for a social gathering, but it was okay.   The crowd instead was your typical Tim Horton's crowd, if that means anything. Lots of families. But it was better than the average.   Food is the same. No free wifi."}
{"text":"This is a review of the branch near gate 1. We arrived here at 10:30am and they were out of eggs and hash browns, so all the breakfast combos on the display boards were not available.  WTF?  Ended up with cream cheese bagel and a chocolate chip cookie. Too bad! I was really counting on this breakfast... The cashier didn't offer any help to select alternatives.  Will not count on them next time."}
{"text":"The location is very central, so many people go in and you - you end up waiting way too long for you order. Otherwise - it's a Tim Horton's - so you know what to expect."}
{"text":"Typical Tim Hortons fare. Unlike the other empty joints in this wing of the terminal, this outlet seems to see a lot of business; that having been said, if there are any lines, they move pretty fast.  Quick, fast, dependable - that's about it."}
{"text":"I imagine these are franchised... The owner should know there is open fighting among the staff. Not good for customer experience and definitely not good for efficient operations.  Staff don't have to live each other but they have to work well with each other."}
{"text":"I don't come here unless it's because of convenience...seriously one of the dirtiest dining areas of any Tim Horton ' s. Food and drinks are pretty standard, service typically unenthusiastic, but there were empty trays in the display again this visit. Why do I bother? Oh yeah, cheap coffee when the alternative is Second Cup."}
{"text":"About 15 minutes ago I visited this location at the drive-through. I ordered a small tropical chill, a plain bagel with peanut butter and jam - to which the girl cut me off and said, \"On the side, ok\". I paused as I've never had this problem before and mentioned that to her. She said, \"Well, we don't do that here.\" Highly annoyed as I was on my lunch and didn't had much time, I told her \"It's ok, I'll go to Wendy's.\" And as I began reversing she said \"Fine, we'll do it.\" which is a rude response in itself, but I had already made my mind up.  Sure I understand dealing with peanut butter in establishments is risky due to peanut allergies, but don't tell me after how many years of going to different Tim Hortons locations without having this issue, that all of a sudden it is a problem. It's not considered fast food if I have to open up a bagel that already has jam all over it and spread my peanut butter too.   I know I sound like a selfish, pompous asshole, but that's not the case. It's about customer service and accommodating your customers no matter how inexpensive the food is.   Anyways, Wendy's got the sale."}
{"text":"So happy that this place was right across the street from our hotel.  We made sure to stop here every morning.  They get you in and out so quickly and both the food and coffee were excellent no matter the time of day.  I wish they they had Timmies in AZ!"}
{"text":"typical Tim's, but if you don't mind the homeless people it is a good place to sit."}
{"text":"This place is filled with people using the bathroom, they should charge for it, we sat near the cashier (very nice guy) and there were more people asking him to open the bathroom, than there were ordering coffee.  I was scared to see how bad the bathroom is, it should be for customers only.  Anyways, a smallish Tim's, but thr coffee was ok."}
{"text":"This place is merely half a step up from a methadone clinic at the best of times. It attracts a rough crowd (the few odd times I've been in there is always someone asking for money), and it filters to the outside - there is constantly garbage, piles of cigarette butts and mysterious liquid on the sidewalk. Or grocery carts filled with empties (4 times in the last week?). Unfortunately, due to the number of people who love cheap, crappy coffee, I'm sure it will never leave - but as a resident of the neighbourhood, I wish daily that it would. What an eyesore."}
{"text":"Ahh the jalapeño bagel with cream cheese- how I have missed you. Our first stop when we come to this side of the border and this location did well. The bagels were fresh and served quickly and the cappuccino was hot. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Saint-Sauveur is a quaint town with some nice accommodations and shopping.  It's even nicer because of a nice Tim Horton's.  I've patronized others in the Laurentians, such as the ones at Mont-Tremblant and Saint-Jerome, but this one is more upscale, for being close to the outlet center or for whatever reason.  Regardless, I am a vacuum cleaner for Tim Horton's donuts.  However, I stop at 2:  (a) the double chocolate donut and (b) the star-shaped donut with strawberry filling.    Slam dunk those Tim Horton's donuts ... and leave this planet a wee bit earlier.  It's as simple as that ... be a little bit of a bon vivant:  eat dessert FIRST!"}
{"text":"Bon, la probabilité qu'un erreur soit faites dans la commande est bonne donc il faut garder l'oeil ouvert. Toutefois, le café vanille française est vraiment bon!! Il faut toutefois faire attention aux calories quand on y va et adopter des petits trucs comme iced cap à base de lait."}
{"text":"Needs better management..number of staff behind the counter is usually higher than the people in line.. Need to clear out the ones who spend hours in the parking lot and even bring lawn chairs in the summer"}
{"text":"I got the Nutella Donut. It's a seasonal menu item for $1.49. Fancy presentation. It does have nuts for people with a peanut allergy. Not bad, it delivers what it promises.   Creamy Chocolate Chill for $1.99. Small size. Decent  but I don't like whip cream, think it's too fatty.  This location is small, with not a lot of seating. It's also sketchy and not in the best area at Keele and Wilson. Washrooms are dirty with graffiti."}
{"text":"Takes too long to wait inside in the line. Looks like drive through is a priority for them( more people working on it."}
{"text":"Average Tim's. Don't go in the AM or at lunch hour unless you want to wait in a long line-up of office bots.   I like contests so I went frequently during Roll Up the Rim. My overall score was pretty sad with only 2 coffee/tea wins in 20+ trips. Pretty bad!  Other than that it's low quality Canadian coffee (not sure how anyone drinks this stuff), okay teas, baked goods, the odd vegetarian soup item, terrible sandwich choices and bagels. Oh and donuts, lots of flash frozen donuts."}
{"text":"not a loyal fan or even loyal customer , but it is a damn good cup of coffee in a pinch....and a tasty donut."}
{"text":"It's a Tim Horton's, not much can be said about it. I only come here to study, and that's what I did."}
{"text":"Regrettably this Tim Horton's gave me food poisoning after visiting this location on Bayview and High Tech about a month ago. Some friends and I play basketball every Thursday in the gymnasium, this is usually our meet up place and we went here after playing. I ordered a chicken wrap, sesame bagel with butter and a carton of 2% plain milk. The bagel and milk tasted fine, but the chicken wrap was cold, didn't taste fresh.   Upset stomach and food poisoning, I'll spare you the details of what happened next. Took about a week for me to feel better. I'm very cautious about where and what I eat outside. Won't be visiting this Tim Horton's to eat again."}
{"text":"I don't like reviewing these chains unless there is something wrong. But this is a strange Tim's.    They have four cashiers and the way you line up is the old school way of picking a cashier, which means if you choose to stand in a line with either a trainee or someone who is ordering 2 dozen donuts, then you're stuck.  This has happened to me on so many occasions where I'm the first person in line and I pick the wrong line and then 2-3 people cut in front of me. Such bad luck.    I really think they should employ the \"central\" line system that is becoming more popular these days, and then it's fair where whoever comes first, gets served first."}
{"text":"Location - excellent  Ambiance - okay  Friendliness of staff - poor - even the manager did not greet us or say hello   Prices - comparable  Dishes bought - bagel with butter and bagel with cream cheese  Taste - okay  Quality - okay- variety was poor   Presentation - okay  As expected or not - not. Bagels were cold even though toasted   Bathroom - NA  Overall cleanliness - okay  Improvement needed - staff's attitude needs drastic changing and product range was limited"}
{"text":"It was hectic but understandable. The building is a small building, so it was difficult to line up to have your order received.   The wait was not long at all. It was 9:55AM. I got my order, as well as the hubby's, for $7:17. We got a small cafe mocha, medium dark roast, lemon blueberry yogurt muffin, and carrot muffin. I love the lemon blueberry muffin! It looks and tastes yummy. The colour is amazing. I like that they didn't sprinkle exuberant amount of sugar on top of an already sweet muffin. I could care less about the carrot muffin but that is someone for someone else's tastebuds.   The parking is enough for people to come in, get beverage and snack, then leave the lot. There is additional parking around the building so it is relatively easy to park your car.   Try, try the lemon blue blah blah. It is a mouthful .....of delicious junk food."}
{"text":"Staff here are very quick at serving. I wish they would have more hot food like chillis etc. It's a very convenient location Brevard you don't have to get out of the ttc station to get your coffee."}
{"text":"Dreadful Tim Horton's, I asked for a toasted bagel with cream cheese and received one that was black, drenched in butter. Disgusting!   My advice: go to the Wendy's and order yourself a sour cream and chives baked potato, $2 and they're amazing!"}
{"text":"I have never had a good experience at this location. You always have to repeat your order multiple times at the drive thru, and you have about at 50% chance of getting your order correct.   They also don't tell you when they're out of Roll Up cups."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.  Don't punish yourself by eating here.  After experiencing a health code violation I will never return here.  The food preparation is sloppy, and there's dramatic variation in quality and consistency of product.  They would rather focus on rationing napkins and ketchup than be in any way concerned about your food.  The only good thing about this place is the friendly lady at the drive-through window.  This review is made after having been to the restaurant several times.  At some point, convenience just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Been here 3-4 times because it's on my way to work and it has never improved. Slow drive through, expect to be there for 10-15 minutes in the morning. I always have to remind the cashier thar they're forgetting part of my order. I had to leave this morning because I had been waiting in line for ten minutes and still hadn't been served. Usually I wouldn't write a review for a fast food place but this is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"This location is very busy during peak hours.  I was in line for about 5 minutes around 8a during the week day.   I wanted to bring bagels to the office and it took a while to get a dozen cut but un-toasted bagels.  The coffee here is good, consistent with other Tim Horton's.  $10 for 12 bagels $10 for cream cheese for the bagels $20 for box of coffee (serves 12)  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"The worst service and very humiliating!!they get the wrong order (ordered a combo instead of just a sandwich)..instead of apologizing they tell me what I should've said one at a time as if this was my first time ordering at timmies...hands me a brown bag, hashbrown n my sandwich separately and hands me my coffee without eye contact.. she told me to put in the bag myself..then made a mistake with my order (ordered a bagel B.E.L.T n they gave me a bagel without the egg) again I went to ask and she said that she had saw the egg in the bagel...and told her colleague that I ordered it wrong and said this is not like McDonald's. Her colleague just looked and walked away.. Well excuse me Mam...you better learn your customer service skills as that's your job! I'm never coming back here and would like the manager to fire her for being very rude!!"}
{"text":"No food available at 2:30am. Staff decided to clean washroom for 30 mins and would not allow access when I had to go to the washroom in an emergency(weak bladder). Not returning."}
{"text":"I don't know if this is the Square One Tim Hortons or the one just outside of it, however I assume this is the one inside Square One.  They've recently renovated and moved (again, used to be near Bulk Barn) and are now located in between the entrance to the lower level of Walmart and TD bank.  The new sign is somewhat festive as it's a red and brown and looks a bit like a X'Mas train.    As for the service, it's fairly fast and while they can have long lineups, they can usually serve you within 5 minutes at the most."}
{"text":"They are very slow and take only one person at a time. They make you wait so long and don't apologize and throw the food at you like they are in a hurry. Like clearly not. Poor poor service.  They make so many people wait forever to even say their order and they always throw shit out the window ????"}
{"text":"Walk in before an 12:30 appointment nearby. Order a turkey bacon club sandwich. Wait 5 mins at the counter til the have bread ready, finally get my sandwich, and there is no turkey on it!  Really Tims, you have the smallest menu ever, and yet you fuck up a sandwich that's name reflect all the ingredients."}
{"text":"Location Tips:  - There's no drive through - Parking is tight and terrible - It's the last Timmy's on Westbound HWY1 if you're leaving the city. Stock up on coffee here before your drive to the mountains. - Plan to see a line up because everyone will be doing this. - The lineup moves surprisingly fast.  - They give up customer service for speed. The questions they ask are in the wrong order from any other fast food restaurant you've ever been to so you'll get cut off when you try to speak. \"I'll get a medium coff...\" \"To stay or to go?!\"   Don't know bagel types off by heart, what type of cream cheese you want or how to properly order a coffee with two creams and two sugars? Oh yeah, you're definitely gonna get some attitude.  - Have a passenger? Good. Send them on the Timmy's run while you fill up the vehicle before your mountain journey. The timing works out perfect.   We'll assume you've been to a Tim Horton's and no what you're getting into. Chances are you've already formed and opinion about this chain that's beloved by Canadians to a downright confusing extent. In terms of star rating, this location is entirely like every other location so with that in mind, here's a few specific you might want to know."}
{"text":"This Tim Horton's is ridiculous. I use this coffee shop because it's close to work and I use the drive thru at 5am. The sign is never turned so your guessing breakfast items. You order and regardless of what it is, it's \"not ready yet\". Muffins, donuts etc. The cups handed to you have coffee spilling out of them, you have to ask for a bag for your items and when they remember a bag, it's missing items. I look for the garbage receptacles and they are out on the lawn close to the main road, far from the drive thru lane. Shame on me for continuing to use this coffee drive thru, but never again."}
{"text":"Man, I feel so bad to rate Tim Horton's so low, but this is one of the weirdest locations I've seen.  I don't think the manger or owner pay much attention to the hiring.  Whether I go in the middle of the afternoon, morning, or weekend, the staff seem so confused. I can be the 2nd one in line and ask for a medium coffee with milk or a french vanilla (which essentially involves pressing a button) and it takes 2-3 minutes to be served.  This is unacceptable for a Tim Horton's and if this location were downtown, they'd have a riot on their hands.   I don't know if they are understaffed or that the staff doesn't care, but I've come here in the afternoon and there is no one at the cash.  So you see them mosey to the cash slowly (looking like they are high or something)  and then finally serve you.  At every other Tim Horton's there's always  dedicated cashier so you know which cash to go to.    This Tim's is a bit of a clusterf*ck, in that you just have to guess which is the right line.  Such awful customer service here, and it'd be faster if I ordered a double shot latte, with soy, 130 degrees with low fat whip cream from Starbucks than trying to order a coffee here.    Terrible."}
{"text":"Not the best. This Tim Hortons has the slowest drive through and the parking lot has lots of blind spots.  The service is blah... they never get my order right. Hire more people and please fix your ice cap machine."}
{"text":"There's some misunderstanding with some of the pictures and tips: this branch is teeny tiny, no seating but they do have a drive through. They're in the same lot as the Petro-Canada that's open 24/7, so you can gas up then drive on over for your Timmie's fix. Line ups inside and out move quick."}
{"text":"I really have to find another coffee joint in this part of town.  The only reason you will find me here is if I am in bad need of a caffeine fix. Not a good place to go if you are a lone female, unless you enjoy being openly checked out by men and hearing cat calls. It's noisy, busy and there's always flies buzzing around in the food case."}
{"text":"once i found a tomatoe sticker in my sandwhich.  enough said. i work nearbyby and so im always at this location.  however i try to avoid it as much as possible. some of the associates are nice but i often find, a lot of them are unknowledgable about punching things into the system to take orders like something that is not complicated such as adding tomatoe or lettuce to an order in a sandwhich is not smooth.  they seem untrainned and the turnover seems high and never sense any sort of management around.  most tim hortons are very smooth and executed like a well oiled machine.  anyway i feel bad about commenting because some.of the asscoiates seem.nice and probably work hard.  the store just has some loose screws that nèed tightening.  however recently they opened two other tims in the surrounding area and i always go there instead.  everything is just better and smoother, like the one inside the hudsons bay food court near yonge."}
{"text":"I come here so often that it's embarrassing. The staff are a hit and miss but the managers are great here and are helpful with everything. The few times orders go wrong they are happy to correct it. Special shoutout to Michael for always being super friendly and a pleasure to talk to! Open 24/7 and being right under my office is a huge plus (or perhaps not such a plus for my wallet and caffeine levels)."}
{"text":"This is the most ghetto Tim Hortons I've ever been I .  It smells like a damp bar. Smells like cigarettes, dirty clothes, musty. Can't chill here at all. Definitely not family friendly. Saw a kid here and felt bad cause that kid is gonna smell like cigarettes. It's also a sleeping spot for old men."}
{"text":"service was all over the place!! but got the order correct surprisingly.  I think it's the kitchen/deli staff that needs management, they distracted our server few times, and than served sandwiches with stale lettuce and tomatoes.  I don't know about anyone but i like my cheese melted on my eggs. just picture this sandwich: dry cold egg, on warm bagel, with stale lettuce and tomatoes, between cheese and egg, with no sauce or butter or anything that would make the sandwich stick together, beside the juice from the runny old tomatoes.  Will post the pic for everyone to see"}
{"text":"This is underground underground. I was so happy to find my Timmy's.  Sausage egg, english muffin is my new breakfast love in the morning along with my double double ( 2 creams, 2 sugars. Strong, sweet, and cheap.  Taking another escalator down the underground mall of Place Marie inside hotel of Queen Elizabeth (taking 2 escalators down).  There is a nice hidden library looking seating.  Dim place to eat and chill. Seems quiet at non peak hours.  I was in line when it was a bit dead and boom there was a long line behind me out of now where.  People must have got of the metro of Bonaventure.  TIMS! yay! Lil secret place..definitely hard to find from the outside world lol.. don't bother to come unless you have the time."}
{"text":"this location used to be great, but lately with all the new staff they have, it is horrible, the orders are wrong the people taking the order are so rude, they don't pay attention and keep you waiting while they talk to each other in another language,"}
{"text":"I can't say I experienced nearly the busy-ness that other reviewers on here have, but this place isn't worth any sort of wait because the product simply isn't good.  Despite the Canadian fame, I found the doughnuts here reminded me more of cheap grocery store pastries than anything else, and I honestly ended up choking them down.  There was no cold coffee, and the closest equivalent - some sort of milkshake thing - was so sweet it basically wrecked my teeth.    I'd strongly recommend simply going somewhere else in the airport."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here for coffee. Fast service and good coffee. Timbits were pretty good here."}
{"text":"On three separate occasions, weeks apart, I've attempted to order chicken noodle soup here and they have been out of it every single time. Whoever is responsible for stock at this location is completely incompetent (I've been a long time Tim Hortons customer at several locations in several cities and have never found this to be an issue before).  The staff here are also much less adept at quickly and efficiency processing large lines than any other Tim Hortons I've ever regularly been to, and even if you just want a donut and there is only a single customer in front of you, you will probably have to wait several minutes while they process, make and hand over that person's order before addressing your transaction that should take seconds. If there is a long line, don't bother and go somewhere else unless you don't value your time at all.  2 stars only because the staff are decently pleasant once they actually get around to serving you, and what stock they do have is acceptable standard Tim Hortons fare."}
{"text":"The best and most honest ferry coffee I've enjoyed in a long time. Boi, that was good."}
{"text":"It's a tims so you know what you get   I ordered a stewed tea however which when I drove away and drank ..... Was on the cold side ..... Lesson learnt ..... Try before you leave the venue"}
{"text":"I hate McDonald's breakfasts ...... And now I am the same about Tim Hortons  Got a bacon breakfast wrap, some weird colours tasteless bacon with a blizzard scrambled egg nest and cheese, wasn't toasted like the photo suggested and frankly tasted like crap   Their steeped tea is nice enough   Staff are flurry impersonal which is a strange occupancy in Canada  I usually have to repeat myself due to my accent which I'm used to, however they seemed to get mad at me here like I was doing it just to piss them off    The cup lids are dreadful too, once you break it open its no longer sealed so beware of sloshing around if you're walking with it"}
{"text":"This is a typical airport restaurant with some nice features including grab and go.  However, long lines persuaded me to move elsewhere.  For seated dining it is understaffed and slow and this is the kiss of death for an airport restaurant.  Tim Horton's are popular in Canada but I don't see the particular attraction."}
{"text":"I waited in line forever and a woman called me up to the register very urgently like she was in a rush. I gave her my order of a chicken wrap with no tomato (I don't care for raw tomatos) and then we stand and wait as she doesn't have a cash register. Very effective. Eventually I get to pay and she tells me my number is 267. Anyway, the same lady then goes to make my wrap. I watch her across the distance making it with tomato. She calls number 276. I assume it isn't me because that's not my number and the wrap has tomato. She eventually determines it is my order. I tell her I ordered no tomato. She opens the wrap, takes off the tomato, and gives it back to me. Seriously? It's a really good thing I'm just picky and no allergic. There was still a huge amount of slimey tomato residue. I won't go back if I see her working."}
{"text":"Among many Tim's in DT Toronto, this one is suitable even for work on a laptop... Meanwhile, they are super fast and nice!"}
{"text":"I was surprised how clean this Tim Hortons was, despite its location and late hours. Definitely Thumbs up!  ..except the bathroom, that was terrible, however good tip for people who needs free toilet access, haha.  ..it is open non-stop which is convenient and it has plugs for laptops around the tables as well.   I hope they will keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff, but such a dirty timmies... Knowing that the place has so many customers, just hire more people to make it proper!! The owner/manager must be cheap, blind or never visiting this place."}
{"text":"One of the few nice locations that I came accross in Ontario. Ok staff, clean place, full shelves and fast moving line up."}
{"text":"The service is quick a usually efficient. I have been in far more worst Tim Hortons in montreal. For a quick bite, fast coffee and even a small timbitsbox to surprise for my coworkers. I always go to Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"Every single time I visit this location my order is absolutely FUCKED. The chick with the cranked out eye continues to fuck my order right up, yesterday I ordered a large triple triple and they gave me a pizza slice?? This place needs to grow up and get it together. A S A P"}
{"text":"Came here late for a warm decaf coffee but at the drive through they said they had no fresh decaf coffee. She asked me to park and in three minutes she would have a fresh pot. I was in no rush so I waited. After a few minutes she came out with complimentary muffins and a large decaf coffee for the waiting. Excellent customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Tim Hortons is the epitome of Canadian mediocrity. This coffee doesn't taste much like coffee.... Why do I still go here?"}
{"text":"It's easier if you go in to order. There is less likely a chance for them to get the order wrong.   I go about once a week and they are okay"}
{"text":"By far, this Tim Hortons is the WORST \"restaurant\" my friends and I have ever witnessed. The food was mediocre at best, but what really fried my timbit was the God forsaken customer \"service\". The cashier was so rude and gave us so much attitude and we felt so unwanted....there were two people there and this lady's level of hospitality was embarrassing for any business. I would definitely recommend the McDonald's right around the corner where you won't get any attitude from the machines."}
{"text":"Alright I'm know this sounds stupid but I'll still be going back to this place but it's the only 24hr one around?! And this is why I think it's stupid that I say that, when ever I go into this specific Tim Hortons something weird and kinda alarming happenes. Alright there are these usual group of older men sitting in a corner and one time they made like wayyyyy too long eye contact, I'm an artist so I just continue to draw in my book and i was drawing for a bout a good 20 minutes but I would sometimes look up to see if they were still stareing and they were!  So I go up to order more food to waken up the staff on duty (timmies employees idk why) and went back to drawing a few more minutes passed by and they kept stareing after getting enough of the hibby gibbies I left. A few other times going there I've even been whistled at and that was quite uncomfortable, not many like to be cat called. Btw the staff are usually nice."}
{"text":"It's like there motto is \"well there's nothing else around so why do we have to be good\". Rude slow staff who seem annoyed they have to get your order. They also didn't have anything we wanted from the menu."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I do not often go to this Tim Hortons at Eglinton Town Centre, as I find their service to be lacking. But after seeing a movie at the Cineplex there, I stopped in just to get a coffee on my way home. There was a bit of a line-up, which was not moving at first, but eventually I ordered my coffee and a few mini-strudels also. I was given the strudels, and then stepped aside to wait for my coffee ... which never came. After a few minutes, I walked over to the other counter, and the person who had served me asked me what I was waiting for, so I said that I had not yet received my coffee, to which she then asked if I had paid for it. After I reminded her, she then asked another server to make it right away. I think she was actually supposed to be running the take-out window which was quite busy also.  Needless to say, I remain unsatisfied again at this location, and probably won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"All the food at the Toronto airport is WAY too expensive -- even by airport standards -- except for the Tim Horton's. There's always a line, and it doesn't move super fast, but if you have 10 minutes, this is a good way to spend it to get a tasty, reasonably healthy lunch cheap. The coffee and donuts are good enough too. The service is not a high point."}
{"text":"Coffee is well, Tim hortons coffee. What need here is staff. Would have rated higher if there was more then 2 people working on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Morning rush. Very inefficient. Ran out of hash browns @ 6:36am to make farmers wrap. Had already waited 7 minutes for my order and so had to wait another 10 minutes for the order.  Was offered a donut instead. Don't come here on the way to work for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Menu is not readable while waiting in line. Instructions to line up unclear and food was terrible. Was lied to... asked if I could have Brown bread and was told their ciabata was Brown.  Chicken was dry, dry, dry. The only  positive thing was my server did ask if I wanted it spicy but the sauce was flavorless! If you're travelling over the lunch hour... bring your own. Selections are skimpy and overpriced at the other restaurants other than Tim's."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons is really plain basic food and the coffee isn't as good anymore (McDonalds coffee is much better)... But I go to this location often for breakfast or snacks because it is beside my work. There's often a large line up but it moves generally fast. My real reason for reviewing this place is that there is a man I believe named McKinnley (sp?) that works there. He is the nicest,  most caring employee there! I return because of him and his nice greetings!"}
{"text":"Five Stars not for the food or anything, cuz its just timmies, but for the location.  Its actually mad gorgeous inside. Just spend a few looking at the walls and ceilings and you'll never go to another timmies again yo."}
{"text":"there are a lot of tim hortons in toronto. I happen to like this one.   I did my undergrad in U of T, naturally spent loads of time here getting brain juice well past 2am. I always study in the back with one or two drinks and stay a very long time. the servers never bug you and there's lots of students that do this. I guess since the owner is a young guy who did his undergrad in u of t as well so he totally understands?   it's right by st george station and sometimes you see lots of interesting characters in here. it's all part of the fun tho. The line up is ALWAYS almost out the door but you are always to get your food/coffee in like 5 mins. the staff are the most efficient people ever! There used to the a fortune telling store just cross from the street on bedford that used to freak me out. it's a condo now i think.   I have many other good memories here. one of which is that i met hubby here. :)   -----100th yelp review!-----"}
{"text":"It's another Tim's, with a sign prominently displayed on the entry door that reads \" free WI FI\", which is great. Having said that, however; there is a somewhat disconcerting procedure to access it. One has to \"register\" with Tim Horton's, probably so they can innundate your inbox with their spam or YIKES, they're in cahoots with CSIS!! ;)"}
{"text":"I have been in this Tim Hortons a number of times, and the product is consistent with other Tim Horton's I have gone to.  The store is quite large, clean and the staff are friendly.  Where they lost a star on their rating is the parking lot.  Anyone who has been there would likely have to chuckle and agree.  This is likely not Tim Horton's fault, but between the gas station, convenient store and Tim Horton's all sharing an awkward-shaped parking lot, it is a bit of an \"accident waiting to happen\".  Enjoy the Timmy's - I give them full points on everything, but the parking lot is like a game of Frogger, so don't text and drive!"}
{"text":"Tim Hortons, is nectar for the soul for me.  Honestly, this Tim Hortons tastes as heavenly as any other.  However, what gives this location a 5 out of 5 for me is two things:  1. Its brand spanking new (within the last year), so it is clean and has been renovated to have the new look and feel of Timmys.  2.  It is properly staffed!  I have written a few reviews on different Timmy's, and many have a slow moving lineup due to improper staffing.  But not this one!  There are lots of staff, and they are efficient to keep things rolling!  All good here!  I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"I am a big Tim Horton's fan, and I sincerely feel like I won the lottery.  I live in Riverbend, which means I have two exits outside of my community -- 18th Street to Glenmore, or..... 18th street through Quarry Park, and out 24th.  Typically, my entrance and exit route is Glenmore, which has me often frequenting Tim Hortons in Riverbend.  I have already reviewed this location, and the short story, is that I am a happy customer there.  The sad truth, is this location is BUSY.  I mean, REALLY busy, since it is servicing both Riverbend and likely Ogden.  Both communities are primarily, more of a \"Tim Horton's\" Crowd versus a \"Starbucks\" crowd.  Well.... what I discovered, is the Tim Horton's in Douglasglen, which is merely an extra 3 minutes by car, during prime time rush hour is DEAD.  Which means?  I was in and out, with my coffee in my hand in mere minutes.    There was no lineup.  That's right folks.... this is NOT a typo.  Anyone who has walked into most Tim Hortons during morning rush hour, expects a lineup out the door.    Well, I expect you will gasp in delight to know I walked right up to the cashier and ordered my extra large decaf coffee with double milk, and was back in my car sippin' within mere minutes.  As much as I am thrilled to share this review, I am afraid this may inundate the only Tim Hortons I have ever been at between 7 - 8 a.m. that did not have a daunting lineup.    I guess that means that Douglasglen is a bit more of a Starbucks crowd....  That's alright by me!"}
{"text":"Sigh... my mama taught me -- if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.    I have plenty of nice things to say about Tim Hortons.  i also have good things to say about Tim Horton's in Riverbend.  However, I do have some constructive feedback.  The short story, is I am a regular here.  I am in this Tim Horton's a few times a week to get my breakfast sandwich and the delicious, DELICIOUS coffee that they serve.  I will continue to go there regardless.  The staff are famililar and are friendly.  On the whole, I have little to complain about.  Except....  In my observation and opinion, I do not beleive they have enough staff on.  There it is.  I said it.  i work downtown, and have seen the well oiled machine of Tim Hortons, where the lineups are literally out the door and around the corner.  It looks hopeless!  But I still have my coffee and my sandwich within 10 minutes.  Its a modern Tim Horton's miracle.  in Riverbend, this is not generally the case.  Sadly, I am conditioned that if I have time, I get my cofffee and breakfast at Riverbend.  if I am running a tad bit behind, I drive downtown, and get my Timmy's downtown.  Sad, isn't it?  I will continue to give this location my business.  However, the sad truth, is that they can use more staff in the mornings.  There are times when no one is at the till, because all the cashiers are filling sugar, pouring coffee, or running into the back to grab something.  This location would be a 5-star Timmy's if their cashiers did nothing but cash, and kept the assembly line going."}
{"text":"Unless you're visiting from out of town or are a new resident, you should already know what a Tim Hortons is. You would also know that it's decent but not great coffee and just decent food that's only suitable as a filler. With that as a basis, it's not fair to compare Tim Hortons to other coffee chains like Starbucks or smaller local gourmet coffee shops that take a lot of pride in where they source their coffee beans or how they meticulously prepare their foods. That's why this review is only for comparing this location to other Tim Hortons locations. I think it's the only fair way to do it.  Entering the store, they have the ordering section and the pick up sections intertwined so it's not the most straightforward. The seating is where it gets better. There are some individual window seats that are ideal for people watching. There's a communal table near the front and some four-people tables along the side that are also suitable for anyone relying on a wheelchair. Along the side and as you approach the bathrooms in the back, the seating becomes more appropriate parties of two and a couple of single padded seats for lounging.  The nice part about this location is that due to the extra-wide sidewalk on Yonge, there is space for a patio section that seats a good number of people yet does not interfere with the pedestrians passing by. You don't get many Tim Hortons with a patio and its a very Canadian thing to enjoy."}
{"text":"This is my local Timmies.  I come here if I'm working from home during the week and I need to get out of the apartment.    If you order a large regular coffee and a double-chocolate donut, there's a 50% chance you'll get an old fashioned plain donut and a large double-double coffee.  Order mix-ups abound.  There's often a lineup, but they'll serve you quickly, not too friendly, then scoot you out.  The seating area is very small, but the view is great for people watching.  Try to avoid the homeless guy."}
{"text":"They used to have soy milk but stopped. Saying  no one orders it but my husband and I did Evey other day. I'm sure there were more than just us too.  They r just being lazy.  It's 2015  not everyone wants to drink cows milk anymore."}
{"text":"As I have said before for many of my tom Hortons reviews because Tim Hortons is such a staple in our community and many of us go here so often we know our drink order my heart and have an expectation of what it should taste like as soon as that first sip hits our lips.  This time got my steeped tea order perfectly and I was very happy about that!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! I will never back going back to this location again! First of all there was a person outside asking for money that on private property you can ask them to leave but no one was.  Next, there were flies EVERYWHERE!!! It was so awful to have to eat your food and drink your drink with them flying all over and it was very annoying.  I don't know where they were coming in from because the door wasn't open just when people were coming in and out but the door wasn't held open or anything and I would say there was hundreds of them. It was awful I had to leave."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say about how horrible my experience was here. Where to start:  - the staff was rude  - my medium steeped tea that was just supposed to be 1 milk and 2 sugar was half milk and no sugar  - my bagel and cream cheese I ordered not toasted was toasted and was given no cream cheese  - when I complained they didn't do anything to rectify the situation.  4 things done wrong and that I am not impressed with and therefore a 1 star review.  This Tim Hortons is within walking distance to my house but I will be driving to Auburn Bay just so that I do not have to go here!"}
{"text":"Always a must when I'm in Canada great Americano coffee to start your day. I always have a 10 pack of Timbits with my coffee."}
{"text":"Their coffee is gross. The food is gross. I remember opening the sandwiches and everything was slapped together, there was sauce on the outside of the wrapper... The bread was stale too. Tim Horton's has bad quality drinks and food.. Not much to like around here these days. Iced capps is the only thing I'll get."}
{"text":"I am really loving this new locations that Timmies is opening up, they are so much nicer. This one has a lounge area, a TV, a fireplace area, the restaurant part looks great lots of natural light coming in, and for me the best part is the free WiFi. I am one of these people that are constantly connected to everything so a please that offer me WiFi is aces in my book!  I really like the \"cafe\" look this new locations have both outside and inside. Timmies is really stepping up their game when it comes to the overall look of the stores. This location looks so modern, with a very relaxed environment on the inside.    I am a proud Timmies customer so my review will always be one sided, can you blame me?1"}
{"text":"This airport Tim Hortons is good for a last minute craving before a flight, or for tourists to get their first taste of Canada.   The good: Typical Tim Hortons food. Lots of cashiers available. Single seats have access to chargers and USB plugs. Lots of sittings available.  The bad: Some cashiers do not understand english (or french for that matter). They screwed up our sandwiches. Waiting isle makes people bend on sides, which came over my seat and food. Why don't they have small glasses like in most Tim's? Tables not always clean, and when they are cleaned, seats put back into places which as much noise as possible.  Not the best Tim in town. Can get better, but for someone who just landed, this is perfect."}
{"text":"Haven't witnessed such a lack of regard since the Timmy's at sherbourne & Richmond's levita. Ordered a smoothie, it took at least 12 minutes in there. They shouted out lemonade smoothie and no one responded. Then this small cashier gave the drink a once over again and shouted mango pineapple.  Twas mine.  I sipped it all the way to the subway platform.  I realized there was no yogurt in the drink and returned to the Timmy's.  I told them it was not made properly and I felt a large amount of sass from the lady who made it. But what was she even upset about? Making me wait so long for a poorly made beverage that I paid $4 for??? Lady, U can keep your sass to yourself.  I'll keep my twoonies.  This Tims is really slow, only go on lunch break when u get 1 hour away. Don't go unless Ur  at gunpoint"}
{"text":"OPEN 24- hours!!!!  What a great Tim Hortons. Came here twice to this exact location when visiting Montreal.   Coffee was very fresh and Hott. Pastries were Delish. Donuts and chocolate croissant were very tasty. People working the counters were also very happy and friendly even at 5 am!  Great downtown location"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest Tim Hortons I've visited. Washrooms were super dirty and smelled like someone had urinated all over the floor / and the floor was also all wet. Also, no drive thru. Ordered some chicken wraps and they don't even look edible. :("}
{"text":"I thought this Tim Hortons was a nice store. The coffee was tasty, and honestly better than Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. The croissant was tasty and the sitting area was nice, with big windows to people watch."}
{"text":"If I remember correctly this TH has plenty of seating and the asian guy to took our order was very nice, quick, and attentive.   The other Th we went to was next to the movie theater and was standing tables only."}
{"text":"I don't always enjoy Tims service but I was here early this morning and the counter and prep staff were super friendly and enjoying their day.  Just made me smile.  Wish more stores would hire this way.   :)"}
{"text":"So handling money and serving food, with out washing hands.. .Eeeks, come on, basic food handing,"}
{"text":"The real reason to love this chain is the fruit explosion muffin.  Or the blueberry one. So scrumptious!  and its open all night which is just great for everybody (except the people who have to deal with the drunk crowds/annoying students at 4 AM).  But yeah, I am a fan of Timmy Ho's."}
{"text":"Nice little drive thru joint they do have a walk thru but the store is so tiny so not expect to sit because the store is tiny. They can be fast some days but very slow when and if the drive thru is packed. Order and go is my philosophy for this location"}
{"text":"I got no hate for Tim Hortons!  This place offered up fast and what tasted pretty healthy sammies.  Not bad when you're searching for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The Asian lady that works on the cash is extremely rude, I asked for a medium triple triple in an extra large cup, she gave it to me in a medium cup and said their extra large cups are roll up the rim therefore she can not give that to me.  I said that's tim hortons problem not mine, so I asked her to put my coffee in a large cup instead since she didn't want to give me the extra large cup, she didn't do that but she gave me the large cup.  So I poured the coffee from the medium to large and left the medium cup on top of the counter and in a very rude voice she said \"next time don't leave the cup on the top of the counter, throw it in the garbage\", I would have have done that if she had done it herself which she should have put it in a large cup at least if she didn't want to give me the extra large cup.  Forwarding this complaint to Tim Hortons Headoffice and posting it on several other internet review sites.  Hopefully she changes her attitude and not act so b*****."}
{"text":"I like this location because they are opened 24 hours! Really nice, especially in this neighbourhood where most things close super early.   There are some comfortable seats, couches, booths, and regular tables and chairs.   The service is not bad but not amazing. The turnover in the staff seem quite high, as I always see new people working here.   This parking lot/area is the most confusing thing ever. Be careful when you are entering or exiting the parking lot."}
{"text":"I really hate Tim's. Their sandwiches are terrible, the donuts taste stale, the soup is from a dry powder mix, the coffee is weak and tasteless.   What is there to like?  And yet people are conditioned to line up and accept terrible service to boot.  STOP the madness!"}
{"text":"Never any parking, and no drive through.  Expect to drive away empty handed!  Geneeal complaint about Tim Horton's: Doughnuts are not fried/baked in house. Too much yucky sauce on sandwiches. What's wrong with a little butter/mayo/mustard???"}
{"text":"The line was very long when I arrived, but it moved fast. It is consistent like any Tim Hortons and good in a pinch (which is why I went there).   Not everyone speaks english, but enough of them do to communicate what you want."}
{"text":"Be wary of the drive through service. Especially in cold weather, it appears the staff enjoy not completing the order, thanking you, or providing a napkin. This past Saturday, I pulled to the side and went into the store up to the counter asking to speak to the lovely worker at the window. Alas, there was an interloper who pacified me with the kissing hash brown (it wasn't for me). I have vowed not to go to the drive through at this place any longer. Service used to be great; now I think it's gone downhill."}
{"text":"My favourite Tim Hortons, they never get my order wrong and have fast service. When they run out of hash browns they always offer something else like cookies. They always make the perfect ice Capps, staff is very friendly which is great because I am not a morning person and they make my going to work early better."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the busier locations in this part of the city, considering it's location to be in close proximity with Somerset station. (Which is the end of the line.) The service here is up and down. Some days you can be lucky and have no line up, with mediocre service. Other days you can have a bit of a line up and very VERY slow service. So, I recommend mobile order for this location, as it is usually faster, and is set to a priority when ordered. I've only had one issue with it so far, when they forgot about me, and I had to wait six minutes for a muffin. It should just be a matter of walking to the display, putting it in a bag, and giving it to you, but this location seems to take a while for this. Is it short staffed? I'm not sure, but I can sure tell you that the service, although friendly, is inconsistent and can be quite slow at times."}
{"text":"I went there last night because they were the only place open 24 hours within walking distance from my hotel. The two young ladies was so sweet and helpful behind the counter as well as tolerant of my inability to speak any French. The croissant at this 24 hour, not so fancy restaurant, in Montreal Canada far exceeds the best croissant I ever had in the United States.  I might go back around 2 AM today."}
{"text":"Very good Tim Hortons compared to a lot of other ones you see in Brampton from my own experience..The speed of serving is pretty good and service.. I've been here a few times and they usually have most good items plus a couple I had never seen before.. Baked goods are pretty fresh.. I cant say much about the rest of Brampton Tim Hortons.. Complete opposite.. I definitely enjoyed coming to this one.. No issues.. And they get my order right.."}
{"text":"Tim's is obviously one of the popular places in Toronto. Came here for a late night snack and coffee and stayed for a few minutes to relax.  Nice environment and fresh desserts!"}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons is combined with a Wendy's so if you're coming with the family, there's something for everyone.  I found it interesting that people were coming in with their own food and drink and occupying a table just to use the free WiFi. Perhaps this is something they should monitor a bit better. I certainly wouldn't complain about having to obtain a password for the WiFi at point of purchase.  Anyway, everything about this Tim Hortons is the same as every other Tim Hortons I've been to. The food is consistent and tasty. We stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered two Turkey Bacon Club with the donut and coffee combo. The clubs were good, the apple fritters (one apple and one blueberry) were fresh and gooey and the coffee was surprisingly good. I'll be honest, I haven't had a Tim Hortons coffee in years but this double double went down nicely.  The service was excellent and everyone we encountered were professional and courteous. Anonymous opinions don't seem to carry much weight with me."}
{"text":"As a Tim Hortons franchise, this place I would say is one of the busiest location in GTA. They get so many customers. Sometimes there's line up but the way the staff always try to make it as fast as possible, they deserve a four star. Not 5 star because there's no drive thru. Keep up the good work - To all Tim Hortons staff."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons location is extremely well organized and seems to be able to handle high volumes of people quickly and efficiently.  I was attending a conference at the Royal York and came here frequently throughout the weekend. Both the restaurant area and washroom are clean and tidy and the service was friendly.  I do have to say though, I ordered their chicken salad sandwich for lunch one day and it was really quite salty... edible, but salty."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons... where a Small is a Medium and Medium is a Large... or is it, the Large is now the new Small? No, wait... that's not the size I wanted. Doesn't anybody here know what a Grande is??  This location is perfect for those looking to make a quick rest stop along their journey. It is accessible from both eastbound and westbound exits off the 401 with easy access back onto the highway when you're ready to continue on your way.  It's clean, spacious and the staff are pleasant... and they have free WiFi!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Tim Horton's numerous times, and every time I've been its been busy without any available seating. Sometimes the line up goes out into the mall. Expect to wait about 5 -7 minutes in the line. They offer free WiFi and accept AMEX and Apple Pay. The quality of the service ranges, sometimes its accurate other times its not- so you should double check your order. The lighting is a bit on the dark side, and the seating area looks pretty clean, although, as I said earlier I've never been able to find a seat."}
{"text":"No sense of hygiene in this place. Lady sneezes and wipes her nose while expecting me to eat food served by her. Lets add the fact I still need to grab the change from her aswe ll. If you want to catch a dirty disease in this place, you know where to come. It amazes me the kind of dirty and sloven people this crappy company hire."}
{"text":"Follow up visit today.  Ordered a very simple thing: small coffee, 2 cream.  Because I like waiting for it to cool a bit, I didn't check if the order was right until a while after leaving.  It's only a coffee - they couldn't have screwed that up, right?  Wrong.  Got a small black with 2 sugar.  Gross.  Come on guys, if you can't get a simple coffee right, how am I ever going to trust you with something more complicated, like a timbit, or heaven forbid - a sandwich with a customization like no tomatoes?  Yeah - strike one Timmies on this location.  I'll probably be back, but wasn't impressed today.."}
{"text":"I discovered Tim Horton's last year at a rest stop on the way back from Niagara Falls.  They had a gluttony special: a warm breakfast sandwich (sausage, egg, and cheese), hash brown, a donut, and a coffee.  I immediately fell in love and the rest is history.  I normally don't review \"franchises\": stores, gas stations, and other places were things are pretty consistent and you know what you're going to get.  Tim Horton's is what Dunkin' Donuts is to the US (only much sweeter). I could live off of the honey cruller....I smuggled a few into the US (I would have been ready for any penalty).  The chocolate glazed donut and blueberry muffin (moist) were good too.    The coffee left a little to be desired - I have no idea why I bother to take any franchise's coffee (McDonald's, Dunkin', etc).  I always hate it, the milk always tastes like cream, and it never has enough sugar."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever at a Tim Horton's and after looking for one for a while I finally found this one. There was a bit of mix up with my order and she ended up charging me for 2 coffees instead of one. Anyways, it wasn't bad. It's definitely more simple and cheaper than Starbucks which is pretty good. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon but it was definitely something I wanted to try out while in Canada."}
{"text":"Just got the caramel french vanilla latte and a 12 grain bagel with cream and it's absolutely delicious. This Tim Horton's is by far the best one I've visited in the whole week I've been in Toronto. The staff are friendly, fast, and helpful."}
{"text":"This was my last Tim Horton's before I left Canada so it was bittersweet. They honestly make the best bagels so I got their bagels with cream cheese which was really good. I did enjoy their caramel vanilla latte, and honestly liked it better than Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is a high traffic coffee shop so the coffee is indeed freshly made.  Dough nuts are donuts so there is no need to comment other than their specials according to seasons and holidays.  Cleanliness is average and litter isn't always removed since the staff is concentrating their efforts at the counter and drive-through.  It is an ideal spot for one easy cup of joe."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Almost every single employee I have seen working there seems like they hate every second of it and it's made clear from the way they interact with customers and between themselves. I understand the location is super busy what with all the traffic and lack of competition in walking distance so now I come in expecting a lot of stuff to be out and it usually is pretty barren. The food is at best just normal and fairly often, pretty sloppily put together (even when the place is literally empty). Traffic can be kinda tricky if you want to do drive-thru during peak hours.   P.S. Funny enough, AS I'm writing this review a customer comes in complaining how \"enough is enough\" and that he has had it with the horrible service he gets here. A mix-up with his payment occurred right afterwards. Needless to say, things got preeeetty heated."}
{"text":"I tried it again and ugh: mass produced America food. Regardless of who says it's Canadian; it's American owned and it's corporate food with no soul."}
{"text":"Like this place a lot mostly because I grew up around here. They fill up the ice caps all the way!!! One time they had given me less tim bits than what I had asked/payed for but they fixed it after I talked to them."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons in new to King West area and is surprisingly pretty busy at certain peak hours however it can be very dead at times. It is a medium sized franchise with various seating areas with the typical fireplace and couches however if you want to go there to charge your phone they have a total of 1 outlet and it is by a communal table that seats 6 so this can be a little awkward if others join you that you do not know. They are still training a few of there employees and I have had my order wrong two of the times I have visited however, I completely understand that everyone has to learn and get used to the jist of things and so I am ok if I get the wrong donut given to me or service is a little slow. They don't have a very big selection of donuts, croissants or cookies but they do always have something in stock which is great. Service is friendly nonetheless and there is always somebody there cleaning or wiping down the tables.   Considering this TIm Hortons is the closest one with a warmer feel to it with a lot more seating than others around the area I will definitely be back and have considered this place my go to area however, I do love to go to Timmies to get a charge up and have a hot chocolate and since this place doesn't have outlets around..it is a little discouraging."}
{"text":"My new obsession: Maple Cinnamon French Toast bagel. Out of this world. If you haven't tried it, make sure you do!  My usual go-to morning coffee station before I head to work. The service is always quick and friendly, moving the line efficiently, especially during the morning rush. I've seen many times how quickly they rectify any wrong orders without any complaints.   The employees there treat each other like family, which in most cases, translates to good communication and team work with one another. It's nice to see them smiling and high five-ing each other. There is ample seating for groups or single seaters.   There is also a Cold Stone partnership at this location, which is an added bonus during summer time or one of those ice cream craving moments.   One of the best locations I've been to. Will definitely be back. Possibly tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is the closest Timmy's to my office.  That said, nobody goes very often... there are tons of better dining and coffee options in the area (Second Cup and Starbucks right across the street, to begin with)...  It's a pretty terrible location, with very limited parking. And no drive-through!  Sometimes, however, I do need my Timmies fix, and the service is very fast, staff people friendly. It's also always PACKED.  Unfortunately they were sold out of my favourite bagel the past two times I visited (everything, of course). Boo!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Tim Horton's, for having the best airport coffee- cheap, hot, and accessible!  Next to gate 163 in YYZ!  Thank you for accepting my American money, even though I have been flying Canada trips all month and really should exchange some dollars.  Thank you for not pushing those delicious maple glazed donuts on me when all I really need is a coffee.  Weight Watchers points averted= 8!"}
{"text":"Who closes a business for construction during summer festivals and parades?? This place"}
{"text":"From sea to shining sea, from Nova Scotia to Vancouver Island...this land was made for you and me, (and Tim Hortons)...sorry...I'm a little off key. When I think Tim H, I think donuts, pastries, coffee, and rush out...  De la Nouvelle-Écosse à l'Île de Vancouver ... cette terre a été faite pour vous et moi, (et Tim Hortons) ... désolé ...C'est d'un voyage ancien, mais il ya des restaurants Tim Hortons partout au Canada, et Montréal ne fait pas exception. Celui-ci était occupé ...  This from an old trip, so this is a while back...as I remember, this place was a bit busy, but a lot less hectic than the one in my old-ex-province of B.C....New Westminster's Royal Columbian Hospital branch (yes, the one where they used as a temporary emergency room).  This institution must probably fuel the work force of Canada by providing sugar-charged pastries to caffeine. I must admit I like this place when you are in a big rush....like being late for a convention."}
{"text":"The coolest Tim Horton's around AND it's open 24/7. This Tim Horton's shares a space with On The Run Convenience Store in a converted theatre that used to show the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Very clean with tables to sit down and enjoy your coffee and snacks. Great artwork that complements the art deco vibe of the building. It's on Danforth before you get to Greektown.   Love the area, lots of little restaurants, fresh fruit and veggie stands with mini-nurseries, even spas to check out while you're strolling down the street with your reasonably priced cup of Tim Horton's coffee in hand."}
{"text":"In a prime spot on the Golden Mile on Eglinton, in the same lot as the movie theatres. A big plus is that it's connected to a Wendy's. Two faux fireplaces lots of seating but usually packed so have a friend reserve a table while you wait in line. Line ups move quickly and staff is efficient. They are usually good about cleaning up. Awkward drive through: the Wendy's drive through is on the right as you enter the parking lot and Tim Horton's is on the left.   Recommendations: cheap $5.99 sandwich/wrap & soup/salad combo, Thai soup or Mexican soup, chili, jalapeño or 4 cheese bagel toasted (you can have it double toasted), filled cookies warmed up, iced coffee with a shot of espresso, dark roast coffee."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars for a Tim Hortons? Service with a genuine smile AND good eye contact, they give you a whole roll with your chili instead of a slice, USB outlets available and it's a good alternative to mall food. Enough said."}
{"text":"My fairly simple drive-thru order was taken incorrectly while I was in line that led to a delay at the window that probably wasn't appreciated by those in the long line behind me. The service was extremely polite (\"Hun\"'s an all!) and the snafu was remedied quickly enough for me though."}
{"text":"This location is one of the fastest locations I've been to. During the morning rush you can get the sense that there's a furious amount of effort taking place in the store to keep the drive thru line moving smoothly. This is how they ALL should run of course, but the location nearest my home is among the worst so having this location on the way to work helps quite a bit.  Kudos to staff and management for doing it right!"}
{"text":"I prepared myself for some sort of horrible experience based on the low rating despite my simple order of just a couple of donuts. I got what I ordered fairly quickly and without issue and the donuts were fresh and tasty. So I guess my experience was either better than others' or my order was simple enough to be free of challenges. Either way, a-ok."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Tim Horton's! We have one in our hockey arena here in Phoenix, but I knew it wouldn't be the same!    Per suggestion, I tried an Iced Cap and could have had 4 more!  A few Nutella inspired pastries and I was in heaven!  So much so, that I grabbed another Ice Cap and some TimBits at the airport for the flight home! Thanks Tim!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is the worst Tim Hortons ever!!! The attitude you get from the same 2 women is so unprofessional! I will only come here if the gas station Tim Hortons is closed. I've stood at the cash while 3 people were talking for 2 Min before asking for my order   I ordered two coffees and asked for a tray... the lady looked at me and just threw it at me.   There bad customer service and there is this place! They are so bad they are on another level on their own   You might be thinking I only post negative things.. but if you look at all my reviews they are usually honest with feedback"}
{"text":"Well , this store is not up to Timmy's normal standards. It was without a doubt the  dirtiest stores I've have ever been in. And one member of the staff really could net give a rip that he was there , he just wanted to go home. Other than that the chicken salad sandwich was great ."}
{"text":"So I was starving after my Moksha Yoga class on a random Sunday afternoon, when I decided to run in here and get myself a cream cheese bagel.   The server prepared my toasted bagel while eating a cheesy sandwich. When I looked at her with disgust and shock, she was exceptionally indifferent. She even had the HIDEOUS strand of cheese hanging from her lips when she set the bagel on the counter.   Gross."}
{"text":"Service here is so slow. There is no reason for it. They need a better system for taking orders and preparing them. Have someone just doing the orders and other people as runners prepping sandwiches and pouring coffee."}
{"text":"Une HONTE !!! Dimanche soir, 22h30, la serveuse était dans l'arrière boutique, j'attendais patiemment qu'elle tourne la tête pour me voir à travers une petite lucarne dans une porte de service... Elle sortait des cartons du congélateur, en pose un au sol... Déjà, je me dis que c'est moyen... Puis elle sort des biscuits congelés d'une boîte, qu'elle pose délicatement sur plaque... Quand soudain, l'un deux lui échappe et tombe au sol... Elle le prend et le met sur la plaque avec les autres biscuits... Enfin, elle arrive, me sert, je paie mon café et lorsque je lui demande si les gâteaux qu'elle mettait sur la plaque étaient prêts à cuire, elle me répond \"oui, mais c'est pas pour tout de suite\"... Elle fut étonnée quand je lui ai demandé si celui qui était tombé allait être cuit aussi... Elle n'a pas répondu, baissé la tête et est retournée dans son arrière boutique... J'espère qu'elle a eu la présence d'esprit de le jeter... Maintenant, elle n'a peut-être pas la formation adéquate, ou pire, la direction fait peut-être pression sur les biscuits non vendus..."}
{"text":"The drive thru at this location is usually pretty busy. Usually faster to go inside and order. Be sure to double check your orders before you leave. I've driven home a few times only to have to go back to get my correct order."}
{"text":"Pretty regular stuff you would expect from any Tim Horton's. The staff is friendly, and the food looks pretty fresh. The bathrooms are clean. Met the owner, pretty cool guy knows how to run the place. Would recommend due to quick service. Only complaint would be the coffee I received was over brewed, but coffee is coffee."}
{"text":"This is the worst Tim Horton's in Canada!  I went there at 5pm on a Wednesday to get a Vanilla Latte, a large milk, and an apple fritter.  Because the wait staff speaks very limited English the line was out the door.  Unfortunately the significant other really wanted her latte.  So after waiting in line I ordered.  Somehow my vanilla latte ended up being a French Vanilla, my large 2% milk became a large \"Double Double\", and the apple fritter was a bagel...of course they took my money before screwing everything up.  In desperation I pleaded for the correct items, but to no avail because no one working spoke English.  I did manage to get a \"free\" milk, and I say \"free\" because I was overcharged for items I did not order.  Then I told them my items were to go, and they said they had no bags and I had to carry it piecemeal.  This is the worst Tim Horton's in Canada and you would serve yourself better if you did not come here."}
{"text":"Never waited for a donut for more than 10 minutes in my life in USA. This one sure surprised me at this major airport.  I will not buy it next time. I'll buy it before I arrive at airport. They can separate customers by building a line only get donuts and coffee. Not breakfast combo"}
{"text":"They were out of a lot of items and the staff move slower than heroin junkies and they are unfriendly."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Decent creamy chicken soup. Had blt and turkey club sandwiches. Both excellent. Get sandwich sauce on side if you want to keep it off of your hands. Very fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I agree with Michelle. This is by far the best tim hortons in toronto. Fast, friendly service; cute, successful people to look at when people watching; and nice big windows for seating!  But that's not what brings me to this review... They have a SELF SERVE KIOSK. I don't know how many other tims have it, but it's awesome. You swipe your card, order, and then it automatically puts it on your card. It's odd you swipe first...but its super fast.  but i have to say, It's silly that they put it in THIS location, because these tim hortons employees are ones i actually like talking to, consistently, throughout my undergrad."}
{"text":"This is the WORST tim hortons in Toronto. Avoid at all costs. There are always people coming in and out just wanting to use the bathroom...I guess cuz its near the TTC? The people behind the counter are SLOW. The line often goes out the door. Literally. Would be fine if it also moved, but it doesn't.  There is also one lady in particular who yell/speaks."}
{"text":"An ok Timmies...I think their whole chain needs to freshen up.  They all look dirty...but this  one slightly more.  Also I wanted to order soup...potato and leek...which was on the sign..but was told they don't serve it anymore and haven't for awhile...but they still didn't take down the sign???  So I got all excited for the soup and then had to settle for chicken noodle.  I don't want to settle but I was out souped.  Tried their green tea frozen lemonade drink as well.  Even though it is cheap..not worth it in my taste world."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons is good for what it is / was: a cheap place to grab a quick joe and donut to have on the go.  However more recently they've raised their prices far too high and have made their sandwiches and donuts far too small to make it worthwhile. Although it can be reaaallyy good on a super cold winter morning, I can't see how so many people have to head over to Timmies at least twice a day; once a week will do me fine."}
{"text":"On the corner of Don Mills and Lawrence this Timmies is beyond busy - often the car line up to get into the incredible tiny lot spills onto the street, impeding traffic at times.  It's tiny and dingy looking (but how can dark brown look glamorous?)   I've been here a few times and if you are in a rush then just don't bother.  From the amount of time it takes to get into the lot, wait for drive thru or even if you want to park and go inside...that alone can take 20 min..lol.  Customer service is hit or miss.  I truly understand that they are continually busy so it must take a toll, but at the end of the day that isn't an excuse unfortunately.  I only go here when I'm desperate.    Due to all the residences nearby (lots of senior housing) this place is always busy.  if you actually want to sit and eat in here...well good luck if you find a seat.     This location has long since outgrown the area and needs to probably double in size to accommodate its customers."}
{"text":"The new latte is a big improvement, finally! The food is all mediocre at best. Bettter coffee nearby."}
{"text":"I've been trying out the mobile app, and this store is the closest to fulfill.  They are very busy and so I thought it would be helpful to have the app to save some time.  I was wrong.  A couple of things, I place 3 separate bagel orders on 3 different occasions and none of them really came out toasted, but people using the app, just want their order in a hurry.  When I complained about this the owner said the bagel is cold because the cream cheese is cold....I can't think of another place that's toasted a bagel, and served it cold.  That's just physics-defying to me.  Also, I have had toasted bagels before...so that was totally bizarre.  The last straw was ordered a box of tim-bits via the app.  The filled the box with 50 plain and sugar covered plain tim-bits as \"assorted\", when I complained and asked for a refund, they told me to wait...like 15 minutes for them to put some sticky not fully cooked chocolate ones in.  (not additional, just in the box).  It was pretty gross.  The Tim Horton's complaint process is such that the owner of the franchise gives you a call back to discuss.  In this case, he sided with the manager ~ who feels that this is a good resolution to my complaint.  I do not agree.  I'm not sure if this Tim Horton's is always bad, but I know that all 4 of the 4 mobile orders I places were unsatisfactory.  As a result, I don't think I would try it again nor would I recommend it to anyone else.  PS.  trying to get a refund for the dollars loaded to the mobile app is also proving to be a challenge.  I also don't recommend downloading the app."}
{"text":"It's a Tims.  The nice thing about it is, that it's the same price as other Tim's and not super inflated despite the fact that it's at the airport."}
{"text":"This Tim's has an ultra long line up.  Like really really long.    Although the staff were pleasant, they seemed to have difficulty with my order.  I ordered a green tea, black, with cold water at the top.  They may have more success with your order.  Double double, anyone?"}
{"text":"It's a nice Timmy's, but it closes early and by the end of the night they don't have much which is understandable.  Also, you need to access it through the Parkway Mall parking lot which is pretty treacherous.  No Drive thru."}
{"text":"This place is madness. For some reason the lines are laid out perpindicular to the front door, so you have to cross through several lines to get to the shortest lines and the food counter. The store should be laid out so that the lines follow the shape of the store, not the other way around. The seating is impossible; there's really no point in staying. That said, the store is well staffed and the place is fairly efficient, though pushing through the crowds to get your bagel, then having to push back through again, especially during rush hour, can drive you insane."}
{"text":"This Tims, at the northwest corner of Lawrence and Don Mills, is in a really bad spot. It's hard to get into the parking lot, especilaly from Lawrence, as cars waiting for the drive-thru back up onto the street. There are only a few parking spots and the lot is tiny. It's best suited for a walk-to for the seniors in the area."}
{"text":"The staff here are wonderful! They are careful and polite. I am sometimes difficult to understand, but at this Tim Hortons, the employees always listen and smile. Good job! Also, the iced capps at this location seem better than many other places for some reason :)"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty so-so, the kind of food you'd normally expect from a coffee shop in the middle of a food court. Everyone was satisfied with their food, and they have nice choices of drinks. There is a large variety of donuts, fritters, whoopie pies, and donut holes. The Canadian Maple donut is really yummy with maple frosting on top filled with cream. The chili was very flavorful with beef, beans, carrots, and mushrooms steaming in a thick beefy sauce. The sandwiches were typical sandwiches, and weren't bad at all.  This Tim Hortons isn't too special, but it's a good place to stop for a snack."}
{"text":"The is a review of the branch after your pass security check to travel to the US.  This is a tiny Tim Hortons... with slow service and NO DONUTS?! Waaaaat!? Only food available for breakfast were bagels and the such. You'd think this would mean the line would fly by with literally no choices for patrons but nope, completely slugged along while the staff chatted as they worked.  Oh, for the record Tim Hortons.... when your line-up is 25 people, it's not the time to get all chitty chatty. Get an actual manager in here and prime your employees to work hard at least at the start of the day. Yes, the line will always be long but the people in line would move along with their day faster... and I'm sure your owner will be happier with better reviews of his business as well as some extra $$$.  Sad. /Trump"}
{"text":"There was a huge FLY in the Donut case on the Canada Donut - the donut with the white frosting and red stars on it.  I told them about it and the guy quickly removed the tray from the donut case.  They didn't bring the tray back and I'm wondering what happened with the tray.  I'm hoping they didn't put the tray back in the donut case after we left.  We were there after midnight the night of Dec 27th."}
{"text":"How do you get a good doughnut in this town??? Why do they taste like day old doughnuts?  The service here is better than most Tim Hortons locations, but the selection is limited - I'm guessing it's because of the small location.  Don't plan on lunch at this location - there is only the option of 2 or 3 different wraps."}
{"text":"Coffee = Inconsistent and okay at best.   Baked Goods = Meh.  Hardly bakery quality. Sandwiches = Assembled, not prepared. Soups = Mmmmm.  Campbells.  If you like that sort of thing. Service = (at this one) Slow and inept.  Despite being Canada's darling, Tim Hortons makes nothing of any real quality.  Everything is mass produced and average."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service.... And we all have flights to catch  You know what right....."}
{"text":"Open 24/7 and fast service as always. Even during rush hours, they make sure people get served really fast while maintaining the quality of their food and coffee. Love this place."}
{"text":"Loved this.  It was snowing, we were freezing, my girlfriend turns to me and gets all excited \"Tim Hortons!\"  We stopped in for a - DELICIOUS - French, cappuccino and that coffee kept us warm in the snow.   The staff was KIND ENOUGH to let us taste the cappuccino before we bought it.  But we loved it, and bought it."}
{"text":"This is a small location that if you have 5 people in line, it starts snaking towards the door and onto the street! Twice, there's only been 1 cash register open and the line up snaking outside."}
{"text":"It's a Tim hortons. Don't be surprised - the menu here is the menu at other Tim hortons.   It would be nice if there was better reason to the lineup situation but again it's a Timmy's. The staff are hot and miss , again it's a Timmy's.   It's not a bad Timmy's."}
{"text":"In my opinion Tim's has good coffee but they have not idea what to do with an English Muffin.  They don't toast it properly and don't butter it so you end up with a disgusting  muffin that is cold, not toasted and no butter which just doesn't work with English Muffins.  It is the same at many of the other Tim's I have been too, when I  forget and order the breakfast sandwich on English Muffin I end up throwing it out.  Too bad, they need to learn how to make it properly.  Toast it so that it is like toast and then butter while hot, there you go!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times to hunker down and study. As is with many other joints of this calibre, there is plenty of room for improvement.   The staff, it seems, are content with their job. A few of them are immigrants who comprehend and speak English fluently, but will understandably not get everything. If you order a decaf, for instance, you might just get a regular. That said, our cashier seemed to be borderline disrespectful and unprofessional for his job. He might have been aiming for a friendly and nonchalant approach, but it could come off as the opposite.  The intent of the setting is to instigate a cozy atmosphere. With the faux stone flooring, juxtaposed by the dingy LED fireplace and bits of litter all over the ground, it's definitely a nice attempt."}
{"text":"Tried the Maple Dip and Maple Swirl donuts. The Maple Dip had a strong maple taste and the Maple Swirl had a vanilla-type glaze with a hint of maple taste to it. Both were good/sweet and I would get both again. The dough taste like most commercial/chain store donuts."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons is a Canadian fast food restaurant, known particularly for their coffee and doughnuts. The menu is pretty extensive, offering coffee, teas, specialty hot/cold beverages, breakfast items, sandwiches, soups, bagels, cookies, doughnuts, and yogurts. While waiting for our flight out, we decided to try out Tim Hortons' breakfast sammies - a sausage, seasoned egg, and cheese on a croissant, with a side of hash browns.  The croissant itself was okay, and the egg was fluffy (usually, I'm not a fan of the eggs at fast food chains, but this one was pretty tasty); I liked that they also gave a nice amount of cheese.  The hash browns, on the other hand, were not crispy and were more on the stale end - it was a little weird, because the line to this place was pretty long, so you would think that things were made-to-order, or that new batches would be frying up.  Just make sure you check your order before you leave, as we received a bagel sandwich instead and had to swap it out!  Located in the YUL airport, this is a nice option for those who are looking for a quick bite.    +Canadian fast food chain +decent option for breakfast sandwiches +inaccurate orders +located inside YUL"}
{"text":"Tim Hortons is a Canadian fast food restaurant, known particularly for their coffee and doughnuts.  There are some THs out in the Midwest, but it's pretty overwhelming in terms of the number of locations that they have in Montreal!  The menu is pretty extensive, offering coffee, teas, specialty hot/cold beverages, breakfast items, sandwiches, soups, bagels, cookies, doughnuts, and yogurts.  Located conveniently off the Place-des-Arts Metro, the hubs and I came here for a quick little snack.  We tried the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich, a breaded white meat chicken patty topped with lettuce, tomato, and spicy mayo sauce, all in a white bun.  This was pretty okay in taste, and it came with a complimentary side of kettle cooked potato chips.  Service was more of a miss, as the employees were playing 'tag' behind the counter; they were oblivious to the number of patrons waiting in line to order (!).  There are plenty of seats to dine-in, and they also offer free wi-fi.  +Canadian fast food chain +complimentary kettle chips with combo +underwhelming service +free wi-fi"}
{"text":"I would say this is one of the worse locations I have visited. It was super quiet with no customers in line and only 2-3 sitting at the tables. The cashiers don't smile or greet you, and when I placed m order, which was a earl grey tea, double sugar n cream in a medium size, they looked super confused. She didn't understand how tea can be ordered double double. She stood there looking at me for a good 10secs, then walked away.  No one really takes a sip of their drink before leaving the restaurant because we believe and trust that the employees have made us what we ordered and paid for. Also, because it's too hot to taste and we have places to go. After leaving, I took a sip of my tea, after it has cooled down a bit and it was TOTALLY not what I have ordered, there was no sugar in there at all! I wasn't going to put in the effort to travel all the way back to get them to switch my coffee.  Maybe there's a reason why other Tim Hortons locations are full and not this one."}
{"text":"This is the worst Tim Hortons location I have ever been to!!  I came here on a Sunday night to grab a coffee with a friend and the first thing I walked in, I felt the place was very messy! There were chairs everywhere, randomly in the middle of the road, blocking the path. The place wasn't even busy so I guess the staff was too lazy to at least push the chairs to the side.  There was no line up so we got served fairly quickly. But the attitude of the employee that was working as fairly rude. She talked in a very rushed tone of voice like she was forced to serve us.  As we got our drinks and approach a table to sit, all the ones which were available were extremely dirty, with crumbles, small pieces of food left of the table, some spilt marks, it was just disgusting!!  I could also see that the trays and plates near the garbage was extremely messy, there were trays disorganized on top of one another, dirty plates all over the place!  IT IS JUST DISGUSTING!!   I would NEVER come back to this location!! I came here because it was closest to my house."}
{"text":"Located @ Birchmount /Ellesmere, it's the one I visit most often. Service is generally pretty quick and efficient. Best thing about this location is that it's 24 hours and has a drive through. It's Tim Horton what more is there to say"}
{"text":"Slow service. Two people doing cash and one of them is eating the inventory.  Had to repeat my order 3 times because she wasn't listening to the whole sentence."}
{"text":"slow service, rude staff. out of stock on many items. kept on taking care of drive through and completely ignored me."}
{"text":"Becareful with this place. Look at your receipt after your purchase because they sneakily charge extra. Might be a little but that is still stealing in my books."}
{"text":"This is the only Tim Hortons I know that doesn't automatically include napkins for your drive thru order AND when you order a combo forgets to give you your drink"}
{"text":"The location is actually amazing however the service is always bad and extremely slow. If you need a meal prepared, I suggest go somewhere else. And the bakery section is always almost empty. It's one of the worst unkept Tim Hortons I've been to."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!   This was my first Tim Horton's.  Growing up in New England, I long heard tales of the confectionery delight known only to those living north of New England's borders.  I swear that with the exception of the vast superiority of the fake Maple flavor at Horton's the donuts are exactly the same in flavor, texture, mouth feel, and after-taste to Dunkin' Donuts.  There was something comforting and familiar about the chain donuts I grew up with, but somehow I was expecting something that warranted the cult that Tim Horton's seems to have.  I'll give you that the coffee at Tim Horton's is among the best of major chains, but there's nothing else particularly noteworthy. This makes me very sad and leaves me wondering if the hype I've heard all my life turned a perfectly average experience into tragedy."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for coffee, donuts, breakfast, or lunch. Conveniently located off of Highway 40 between Ottawa and Montreal and is adjacent to an Esso gas station and other restaurants and convenience stores.   This Tim Horton's is efficient with English speaking staff who are also courteous. It is clean, including the washrooms. Nice stop to rest for a little bit, get some gas, and some hot piping coffee."}
{"text":"Probably the only timmies I know with people hitting up the drive through for spare change lol."}
{"text":"Busiest Tim Horton's (and largest) in Brampton to my knowledge.  Open in the restaurant and drive through both 24 hours a day.  Drive-through moves pretty quick but its a zoo in the morning like you wouldn't believe"}
{"text":"I do a lot of freelance AV work at the Royal York hotel and the closest place to go late at night or early in the morning is this place. Every time I order I have to say excuse me several times because I can't understand what the cashiers are saying. If you are on the front lines serving the public you should be able to communicate clearly. I shouldn't have to ask you 3 times to repeat yourself. Same goes for people answering phones!  And what's the deal with not accepting Interac?"}
{"text":"As far as Tim Horton's is concerned, this branch is decent.  It opened August or September of 2011 so it's fairly new and the facilities reflect that.  Like all Tim Horton's the coffee is nothing to rave about and the donuts are edible.  Two things make this Tim Horton's a bit special.  First there are coffee shops and plentiful seating in the general area so seating in the actual Tim Horton's can be regularly found and waiting lines aren't atrocious.  Secondly, a loony product manager went wild during the creation of this branch and now there's a Cold Stone Creamery ice cream shop chillaxing inside next to the coffee counter as well.  This corporate pairing is a little surprising.  Cold Stone Creamery is a higher end brand while Tim Horton's just isn't.  As a guy with a sweet tooth I can appreciate the pairing.  Coffee, donuts and ice cream all in one location seems like a waist line stretching combination."}
{"text":"Loses a star for lack of a drive thru and limited parking.  Other than that it is your typical Timmy's.  Awesome friendly staff. Consistent food and coffee.   A bit busy with the nearby hospital but I don't mind the opportunity to check out cutie EMS and Firefighters."}
{"text":"Brand new Timmy's right down the street from my office FINALLY!  I was beginning to think I wosrked at the wrong end of downtown as further east you cant cross the street without hitting a Tim Horton's.  We have Starbucks next door in Husky but seriously, 30 minutes to get a coffee because the entire tower is taking a break at the same time, not likely!  Tim's may line up but let's face it, they are fast.  This location aside from being perfectly situated for me is also brand spanking new so its clean and it has a tv and a fireplace along with wifi.  Service is consistent, fast and always with a smile.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Tim Horton's before this one, and it's about on par with what I would expect to find at a Dunkin' Donuts or a Krispy Kreme back home. Granted, it was a bit cleaner inside than either of those places (they served me my doughnuts on a glass plate too, which was a nice touch), but as far as the food itself was concerned, I could barely tell the difference. This isn't a bad thing, I guess, but I mean it's not over-the-top fantastic either. I got a blueberry doughnut and an apple doughnut; both were good, but you can definitely tell that they're \"fast food.\" I don't really know how else to put it. I wouldn't advise AGAINST coming here if you just want to grab a quick bite to eat, but if you're looking for something more than that, you can definitely find better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Iced cap, turkey bacon club... can't go wrong...."}
{"text":"1.5 stars, really? Come on Toronto...this shop was a lifesaver for us on more than one occasion on our recent trip to Toronto, and the food and service were certainly above average! I also love that they're open 24 hours.  ++ Love their oatmeal, and it's such a unique offering. It takes a bit of time to come out but it's nice and hot when it does, and flavour is spot on  BELT on sesame bagel: good ingredients, but the only thing missing was mayonnaise because the sandwich was dry without any dressing   Service: every time we came here, we somehow always ended up getting the same staff take our orders, and he was exceptionally friendly, quick, patient, and drama free. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very nice tim hortons, this place has been recently renovated and it is amazing. The place is so nice from inside. The service is something I am not a big fan of as I always wait in line more that I think should be expected for Tim Hortons. As the cashier people seems to take there time and they talk alot between each other. Also for prepping the sandwiches sometimes I notice some delay. Otherwise the quality of the food is amazing. I have not complain about the coffee I order specially many other Tim Hortons have been giving me hard time as ever time it tasted different. At this location the coffee always taste great.   Washroom can be improved as they donot seem to be recently renovated but they are not bad at all."}
{"text":"Tim horton's at 6am: homeless people, druggies, police officers, and me!! Haha, in all seriousness, I liked the coffee and donuts. I can see why canada is proud."}
{"text":"Not clean place and always a lot of people. No drive thru service I dont think u should go to this place.  Bathroom is also dirty Coffe taste not fresh and milk is sour Never again"}
{"text":"4.5 stars, because it's 24 hours (and in the downtown core, we have slim pickings of 24 hour anything )and because my experience with this place mostly pertains to overnight Timmie runs and breakfast hour.  This places is awesome - I love the space and the cleanliness they maintain during the morning rush - I imagine that if they can do that while trying to eliminate the maddening lineup, they can do it any time of the day and in the wee hours of the morning, it is IMMACULATE.  The food here is pretty good - things are baked and prepared to my  expectations, I have yet a problem. I like that the staff smile; don't say much often but they at least smile. In the night time they even chat a bit which is nice, because I have done my time as an overnighter in a Tims and other places and it is NOT easy to keep eyes open let alone smile or chat . This was particularly heartwarming as my last dealing with overnight staff at a different Timmies was disheartening.  ONE beef: why are there so many homeless /panhandlers crowding the door to this place? I feel awful walking out with food and no change to donate or even giving a dime to ONE and not to the other 5 that crowd this rather tiny entrance No it's not gonna stop me from going - I will walk the extra 5 minutes to get my food here and forgo the 3 other Tims in immediate vicinity - but the door people are annoying."}
{"text":"I could be biased in this review because this is where my direly needed morning caffeine fix is had, and anything that gives me my first fix, is generally favoured; this place is golden.  One of the tiniest Timmies I've been to and generally I don't like tiny Tims or ones in food courts as they tend to be extra slow in service and order mix up is a norm; but not this one.  The lineup here is MADDENING - but the wait time is comparatively short and, orders are made properly and correctly. The switch they made in how the line up is handled - having multiple cash registers open -was quite effective in achieving this effectiveness PLUS allowing some room for passerbys to squeeze through(although that didn't last, cuz more people seem to have heard of this gap and shortened line and appeared to help it lengthen). The morning rush is insane - but the cashiers in general are friendly and accurate. The order -getters are nice and are happy to make last adjustments to how ur order is made. This seems so trivial but I realize how much I appreciate this little gesture of changing my order from a DD to a regular with milk AFTER making the drink  and without signs of irritation - adds to the good vibrations:D  one lil known secret: if you get to this location before 820am, there is almost always no line up. After 830 -ur in line.not that long, but still in line.  good job guys!"}
{"text":"My layover brought me to Toronto for a few hours so you cannot NOT have Tim Horton's while in Canada. The hype is so real that my friend and I made it a point to find this Canadian staple before boarding our next flight.  I ordered a crispy chicken meal complete with a sandwich, a side, and a drink and found it to be very satisfactory. The chicken was succulent and my side of potato wedges were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside--just the way I like them.  All in all, a super filling meal. While I wasn't blown away, I perhaps enjoyed it more than I would simply because it was the first meal that I didn't eat goulash or sausages after eating it for days on my vacation. I know Tim Horton's is known more for their donuts and coffee, which I regrettably didn't get to try but will make sure to do so next time in Canada!  Keep in mind that there is a bit of a wait (as it is one of the few spots with reasonable prices in the airport) and service is a bit slow... so might not be the best choice if you have a flight to catch. BUT if you have a lot of time to spare on that layover definitely would recommend as it is affordable, filling, and pretty good!"}
{"text":"Tim's recently opened and so far location has been fantastic.   Donut, cookies, bagels and muffins selection is very good but since it's open I had to downgrade 4 stars to 3 stars due to hit and miss of the previous mention items on a consistent basis.   Staff is fast and friendly. Seating area is very different from traditional locations but has a nice feel to it.   Pricing is good and Apple Pay is accepted!  Overall Tim's fans should be happy with this location at Mahogany at Urban Village Market."}
{"text":"Suis en accord avec Julie H. Bien situé et beaucoup d'employés avec le sourire. Service très efficace. Belle grande terrasse."}
{"text":"Service très rapide avec le sourire. Toutes les tables étaient salles malheureusement. Bon café chaud"}
{"text":"I dun think these guys at this location have ever messed up. Not once. (And i come here wayyyyy more than i actually remember to check in!) They are all super here and always friendly and smiling, i hafta agree with the other reviews.  Drive-thru; inside; terrace... 2 parking lots always parking available...  Service is great anyway u come to this place.  The staff here even know whether it's myself, my bf or even if my bro-in-law is driving what our exact order is...without any of us saying more than hi can i have 3 coffees? ...they equally know not to assume that's my order when i'm here with clients.... This may very well be the best Timmys location anywhere!"}
{"text":"Typical Tim Hortons.  Lot of real estate transactions and people studying occurring late night.  The racks of donuts and muffins empty by 1am.  If you drink tea you can get a refill of hot water.  Washrooms were ok clean.  Just a complaint about the customers leaving food debris on the table and not looking after themselves.  Maybe it is because of the people living around that area."}
{"text":"Located in the Simcoe Place (CBC building) food court.  This is the reason that the County Style / Yogen Fruz closed down, or was is that no one was eating there before this Timmie's opened up?  Typical food court Tim Horton's. Rarely ever have i seen this place wit no lineup.  Any difference between this and other Tim's?  Not that I can think of right now, except for location, of course."}
{"text":"It's a 24/7 place and there is almost always a group of loudmouths that annoy you in their colorful language. The place is often filthy - no pride in maintaining the place;  Service? You almost have to drag additional staff from the back as it can get busy fast, but they are not always forthcoming. Mala - one of the staff - always has a good attitude and is quick to respond and serve. Donuts have always been fresh, though..."}
{"text":"My first time trying Tim Hortons & they are every bit as nice as everyone has told me about the donuts were so fresh & the staff were very quick & curtious which I like. Next I'm a Toronto pearsons I'll drop in again for sure."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong ever with Timmy's, I just find that sometimes they don't have oatmeal and I think if it's on the menu of a big company, it should be available. But like I said it's always consistent and good, steep tea double double is a favorite and the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Ever want your food made wrong every time you order? This location is GREAT for that! I have come to the conclusion that over the last 2 years, the owner deliberately leaves ingredients out of the recipe to save some $$$. Want a farmers breakfast wrap? Sure, but no hashbrown! Want a bagel BELT? ok, but no cheese! Double double coffee? Sure... except for the sugar! Oh was that a turkey bacon club? Ok..but no lettuce!"}
{"text":"Everything wrong with this place... wrong orders, get coffee instead of tea, cold coffee, asked for toasted bagel and it wasn't, gave wrong change back, bad attitude and terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Timmies while passing through the town...  It's a fairly busy location...  Has only pair of power outlets...  Wifi is a tad slow...  Coffee is decent, but service is top notch...!!!  Be wary of the school kids messing up the place around lunch hours...  Would stop by if in the area again..."}
{"text":"Quick & friendly service. The restaurant is fairly clean, the table I sat at had not been wiped down and there is bits of trash on the floor. However, it is your typical Tim Hortons with a good looking assortment of treats. I had their iced vanilla latte. I don't think I would order it again because it is like drinking pure sugar, you cannot even taste the coffee in it."}
{"text":"Decent Tim Horton's, seating area somewhat cramped and you sort of go searching for the number of chairs you need. Coffee is hot and fresh. Overall, I would return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"this tim's is very dirty  and  the owner of this place is not supporting of his staff and has  staff members that  come to work drunk or high on weed I would not  recommend  this place for any one to eat at or drink coffee  the coffee is like out of date  I worked here and pulled out the sandwitch board  there was enough food to supply an army  boycott this place"}
{"text":"ok I've been here a couple of times its like a McDonald's   always missing something  put a bagel bun on my extreme Italian sandwich  put one of those soup buns on to countless times ._.  also the frozen lemonade I got was mostly melted and tasted like pure syrup  with that being said I don't recommend this Tim Hortons to anyone  1 star"}
{"text":"I've been to Canada quite a few times and knew all about Tim Horton's.  But somehow I didn't see the magic until this trip.  I was in Toronto for 2 weeks working on a project, and lo and behold, there was a 24 hour Tim Hortons across the street from my office.  My client introduced me to the double double.  Where I come from, that's a burger at In N Out.  At Tim Hortons, it's a coffee with 2 creams and 2 sugars.  I am told there is also crack in these things, which is why they're so addicting.  Spent most of my days in town stopping here on the way to work, and I have myself quite the addiction now."}
{"text":"Tim hortons is the worst coffee place in the whole entire world. Horrible coffee and always horrible service. Every Tim hortons is dirty and the staff are slow!!! By far a century behind Starbucks."}
{"text":"Drive-thru is usually VERY fast! I frequent this location 3-4 times a week. It looses two stars really just based on three factors.  a) Half the time they run out of popular items such as Apple Fritters & Boston Crème doughnuts.  b) The Honey Crueler at this location in particular is terrible! Very soggy and runny. Not sure why only this location so many issues. I've ordered it at least 5-6-7 times and every time the same  c) They've put up and/or forget to take down a couple promotions which I've tried to order, only for them to tell him it hasn't started yet or it's already ended...even though the signage is still there. They will NOT honor the pricing!"}
{"text":"Deep in the bowls of Copperfield, this new Timmy's has popped up. Now I know for many of you it might feel like you're driving half way to Medicine Hat to get to this location, but I promise you that you won't go passed Gleichen to find this one.  This location is set up to have more of a \"neighbourhood cafe\" feel instead of a \"cram as many people through as humanly possible\" setup. There's no drive-thru here and at one end of the seating area there are leather lounge chairs in front of a fireplace with a TV over it. I guess Tim feels that Cranstonites want somewhere to come and visit with their neighbours instead of somewhere to get their IV coffee injection every morning.  On my visit late on a Sunday night the place was quiet with only one person sitting in a booth working away on her laptop. The employee that helped me was very friendly and greeted me with a smile when I walked up to the counter. She even took the time to double cup my tea before giving it to me because she was worried the cup was too hot since the pot of tea had just finished brewing. Its always nice to get a little extra in customer service from somewhere you don't really expect it."}
{"text":"Being right across the street from the Sherbourne subway station this Timmy's is always busy.  Expect a line at least 4 people deep most times of the day.  The staff are generally really quick.  There is no seating here as it is more of an \"express\" style place. Just grab your coffee and go."}
{"text":"The overall experience was fine for the place itself. Unfortunately the riff-raff hanging out outside was not so pleasant."}
{"text":"If you didn't like having to go into the mall or one of the buildings in the area to get your Timmie's fix, there's now one out on Yonge street in this area.   It's new and nice and the staff don't seem to be jaded yet. I came late in the afternoon so it wasn't busy and got my tea in short order.  There's lots of signs outside announcing they're open in case you can't spot them right beside the theatre."}
{"text":"I like this location because of the walk-up window. I find ordering inside to be a pain. The counter is crammed into a small corner of the Shoppers and it can be a little tight getting in and out when there is a line. Being able to stand outside, place my order and wait to the side out of everyone's way is ideal for me.  Due to its small location, they only have drinks and baked goods here. They don't do any sandwiches or paninis."}
{"text":"This location is right beside gate c26 in terminal 3. There is always a line, day or night. Though the line always moves quickly. The staff are quick and efficient but could be a little friendlier."}
{"text":"This location is absolute insanity in the morning. Heaven forbid that people alternate or let you get into the lot if you want to go inside the restaurant instead of the drive-thru. I have no complaints about the service or food quality, they're pretty standard. The low star rating here is for the douches that are raging because they haven't had their morning fix yet. Its unfortunate that it reflects on this location, but a huge reason I would go to another location over this one."}
{"text":"After a little visit to the courthouse near by I found this location using the Yelp app. From the outside it's an unsuspecting location, seemingly just like the rest. After walking in though, it's a different story to be told. At just after 10am the place was packed. The lines were a half-dozen people deep but there were a ton of staff to get everyone through. To keep everyone organized you get a receipt with an order number. Just wait to the side for them to call your number and you're good to go. There's lots of seating but as busy as it was you may be hard to find a seat at certain times of the day."}
{"text":"While in university I worked a couple blocks from here and being the young guy on the shipping/receiving team I was always the one sent over to get everyone's order fulfilled while we waited for the weekly delivery truck to show up.  Since then not much has changed except for a face lift. The line is still out the door and the parking lot a mess to get in and out of. Your best bet here is to park near by and walk over. The customer service here was pretty good. They had the line killed quite quickly."}
{"text":"This location is a little hit and miss. Sometimes the service is good and you're in and out. Other times no so much.  Product quality is also along the same lines. Sometimes a piping hot steeped tea, other times barely warm."}
{"text":"While I am not an environmentalist, this place is an environmental disaster. The drive thru lane essentially blocks the small parking lot, making the drive thru the main option. Cars wrap around the building with engines running all day long while there is no wait inside.  The immediate grounds are littered with cigarette butts and trash. Within a block of the restaurant, there are literally hundreds of Tim Horton's cups, wrappers, and other debris littering the neighborhood. While I am sure that Tim Horton's could care less, the debris and pollution reflects poorly on the neighborhood and the cult followers of this average donut and coffee shop.  As far as the food goes, it is on par with the rest of the Tim Horton's."}
{"text":"It is Tim Horton's, but somehow my service experiences here are better than the other locations I visit.  Stay away from the sweetened chocolate iced coffee drink, as it is not what you really want, even if you think it at first.  Other than that, expect the fairly uniform Tim Horton's experience.... Limited seating and Canadian maple donuts included."}
{"text":"This is a better than average Tim Horton's. While it suffers from individuals monopolizing tables for way too long, the strange appearance of employee tip jars, and occasional annoyances from professional beggars that approach fairly often inside the restaurant, there are things to like....  1. Really good selection. You will usually find most available donuts available.  2. Friendly and usually quick staff. Those that prepare the sandwiches are particularly noteworthy for kind smiles and efficiency. 3. Seating. While some mornings are brutal for finding a seat, there are a reasonable amount of tables. 4. Great location. Right at the Bathurst and Dundas streetcar stops on the corner."}
{"text":"Firstly, it took forever for me to get my food. Secondly it was served like slop. I don't know how or why Timmies has such a large cult following.   Foot is absolute crap, coffee tastes burnt and the service is absolute poor.   I will never return to this location again."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Tim Hortons for about 12 years now.  Not because I like it, but because it's the closest one to my inlaws house when I stay there. I love Tim Hortons, don't get me wrong, but this one is so small and the parking lot is a complete nightmare.  I've always stopped there in the morning before my drive home to the states.  When the US customs guy asks me what I'm bringing into the states, I hold up my cup and box of Tim Bits, that's usually the end of that conversation and they wave me on.  Thanks Tim Hortons.  The coffee is always good and I've always been happy with everything they've served.  I'm really surprised they never tore this place down and bought a bigger property with more parking.  Sorry Tim Hortons for driving over your curb and causing all kinds of damage.  oops did I say that."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the donuts and pastries from Tim Hortons, especially the apple or blueberry fritters, my favourites. The coffee is pretty decent and the Iced Capps are refreshing.  On this visit, with three friends, I was not disappointed with my Mocha Iced Capp or Apple fritter. My friends were happy with their coffees as well. We were, however, disappointed with the cleanliness of the restaurant. Most of the tables had bits of leftover garbage on them and needed to be wiped and sanitized. The restaurant was fairly empty at the time so I expect it could have been done."}
{"text":"No longer open 24 hours, which hurts it for me.   When it's busy, the lineup can get long. When it's empty, the service can get careless.  Pretty standard otherwise."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for my morning cuppa Joe.  The only male crew there always make my day. he's cheerful and consistent.  But the other lady shaheen or sheehan is the most miserable you will ever see.  No smile,  no greeting,  rude and bangs your coffee on the counter.  Each time I see her in the cash I want to turn around and go to Starbucks instead.  She should have proper training on customer service.  The manager should assign her in the back where there will be less customer interaction.  She already tainted my day and I'm not so happy about it"}
{"text":"Je ne ressens pas le besoin de parler du produit, comme c'est pareil dans tous les Tim Hortons, mais je tiens à souligner une grande rapidité du service. La caissière m'a servi très rapidement et avec courtoisie.   L'endroit était très occupé et particulièrement sale. Je crois qu'un employé à temps plein sur le ménage en heure de pointe leur ferait le plus grand bien. C'est quand même leur image qui en souffre.  Mon Tim Glacé est en tout cas très bon ;)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times to have a beverage and chat with a friend -- it's a bit noisy and it could be cleaner. As others have noted, it shares the tarmac with a busy gas station, so getting in and out of the parking lot can be tricky. Be sure to watch out for vehicles darting in and out of the laneways. It's not hip or cool or anything like that, but what did you expect, fair trade organic artisan roast?"}
{"text":"Came here early. Around 7:05am, asked if there were cookies (chocolate chunk or oatmeal, Usually at other drive through Tim Hortons have it ready) The lady at the cashier asked her staff if there were any, he gave the worst attitude. You can give attitude, but not in front of a customer! Rude and ridiculous. Just be professional and say a simple no. How hard can that be? On that note, ordered a dark roast double double. Tastes horrible. Ordered the steeped tea, taste like water and milk. Will never come back again.   Need to improve their customer service and their drinks big time."}
{"text":"I live around the area, I come here a lot. Usually I order a small dark roast double double and most of the time it taste horrible. So I've tried ordering others like a regular double double , small steeped tea double double and it still tasted the same. It tastes like water and cream. Also the service is not so great either. I always feel like they're in a rush to get me out of there. I understand that I gotta move fast but at least give me a sec to get my drink and it put down! And not to mention there wasn't even anyone behind me! Don't get me wrong, I'm not the type that holds up a line I hardly come here anymore. The location at Kennedy and major MacKenzie is wonderful! Although it is not a lot of money but you get what you paid for!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Timmie's ever... honestly. We went through the drive thru for our order. We ordered and drove up to the pick-up window. The driver greeted the employee with a, \"hello.\" All he got was a grumpy stare back. He made a joking comment about how it would be nice to greet him back. The employee had the audacity to say back, \"it's not my job to say hello and smile.\" UMMM DEFINITELY THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH MANAGEMENT IF THE EMPLOYEE THINKS IT IS NOT. And to top it all off, the bacon wrap raw... ewh. At least my order was made perfectly, I mean, a large green tea and one sugar, how hard can that be?"}
{"text":"The staff at this location is rude, but the food is good quality and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Thank you to my Canadian collegues for training me in the method of ordering at Timmy's!  We stopped at this local chain throughout our trip in Canada but I could only remember the location of my last visit (airport).  I didn't see too much of an issue at the airport....  For a newbie to the chain the order line reminded me of the Seinfield episode with the Soup Nazi.  Stand to the left, look to the right...order in code.  There's a lot to look at in the counter....mmmm pastry display!  Again, my collegues didn't want to be seen with the silly American holding up the order line so I got some tips before heading in.  Know what you are ordering before you get in line.  Don't wait at the cashier to make a decision.  List the items and the choice: \"I would like the breakfast sandwich with bacon.  A large coffee double double, please.\"   The cream and sugar ordering really threw me for a loop.  I still don't know if it's cream and then sugar or vice versa. I just know I like my coffee sweet and milky so I am definitely a two cream and sugar packet person.   The food was excellent, affordable and quick.  And for bonus points - I absolutely love the regional difference so I definitely appreciated the experience."}
{"text":"This location continues to slide downhill. Wrong orders, dirty facility, always the last to have the promotional items. Seems all the good staff went to a newer location nearby. Still gets the job done."}
{"text":"Ok -- Tim's always has good coffee but things to note about this location are:  - it is a \"drive up\" window on the west side of a Shopper's Drug Mart just east of Coxwell on Danforth.  - If you order food -- always check you got what you ordered. Matter of fact, check your coffee too!  Not to be picky, but this is a coffee and donut/muffin/bagel location.  Is it that hard to get it right?  I certainly do a lot better at other locations, but they seem to constantly get it wrong.  I am currently looking for another location with easy access (westbound into the city).  If anyone has any suggestions - please tell me!   I am tired of paying for things that I don't get!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest. No matter what I write, is it REALLY going to affect your decision to visit the only Tim Hortons in the terminal?"}
{"text":"The line up was incredibly long but the staff were all chit-chatting to each other about non work related things.  The staff who served me asked me twice about my order and still got my order wrong."}
{"text":"They renovated this Tim Hortons. It has a patio in the parking garage now. Aside from that, pretty much the same!"}
{"text":"This place is relatively close to where I work so I might stop by here occasionally when I feel like a doughnut/muffin/danish or something sweet to drink like a frozen lemonade, fruit smoothie, or an ice cappuccino. I'm not a big coffee drinker so will rarely have a coffee here. On top of that, there is free coffee where I work which is another reason why I rarely purchase coffee on a work day.  This Tim Hortons is close to McGill University so there will be a lot of university students ordering and hanging around.  There is free WiFi. The line-ups can be long so if you must leave in under 15 minutes, this might not be the place for you but then if you really want something at Tim Hortons, there are at least two other Tim Hortons with generally shorter lines (one inside Promenades Cathedrale and another Tim Hortons at the McGill metro near Pizza Soleil and a tailor or dry cleaning shop) within a 7 minute walk from this place.  As a few other reviewers mentioned, people have gotten their items stolen while eating/ordering at this Tim Hortons so you should be very careful and even though seats/tables might be or get scarce or your bag may be heavy, don't \"reserve\" your table/seat by putting your bag or items unattended while you order. Also, when you are enjoying your food/drink at the table/booth, keep your eyes on your personal belongings.  I've ordered things here to go and I've also ordered things here and eaten inside. Other than the long wait to order and to get my order, I've never had any real issues."}
{"text":"Went through drive through...they managed to get the tea wrong again,.....gave me a coffee.  I don't know why I bother to even ask for a tea anymore, as they seem to give me whatever they please. At least the person who dealt with me (after I parked my car and went in) apologized, while the moron who was working the drive through window just looked at me....."}
{"text":"Nope. Out of half the things in my order, I ask for extra cheese they punch in that I want no cheese then charge me for extra cheese twice? Sandwiches weren't even made as per my order. The night crew never disappoint but this morning crew is useless."}
{"text":"This is the Tim Hortons that served me watered down hot chocolate. This morning I ordered a turkey egg white breakfast sandwich and for the third consecutive time I didn't get what I ordered. Regular eggs instead of egg whites and English muffin in stead of the bread I ordered. Seriously guy if I'm paying extra for my order than all other sandwiches it would nice if you could actually give me what I ordered.   Going to go out of my way to get breakfast somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"i miss you, Tim.  this long distance relationship is taking a toll on us.  i mean, you're not even my type... i like savory cuisine over sweet. you're too sweet, like giving-me-a-cavity sweet.   my friends wanted to see you on that blistery-cold night.  i obliged--- even though i knew you would be starry-eyed.  shhhhhhh. i know, i know.  we could never work, but i crave for your fluffy body. (doughnuts) your delicious liquids. (coffee) your huge and manly windows.  that hockey STICK you flash me.   goodbye my lover. goodbye my friend.  you're the only one....  you're the only one for me."}
{"text":"I usually come here before work on weekends and pick up a hot chocolate and a  crate of TimBits. Service is a little slow, and they never have enough Timbits ti fill out my box, they only have the \"leftovers\" of the jelly filled once, which I try and avoid.   They lack donut selection, like there is not enough, or they are already out of stock at 8am. I grab and go, its cheap and good, just missing the selection!"}
{"text":"Love coming to get my timbits here! This Tim Horton's as the same problems like every other one I've visited: the display case is always empty, and hardly any choice. It's open 24/7; you would think they would refill the case especially in mid evening.  The restaurant is clean, could be some improvements, and the staff doesn't want to be there, so they are a little rude."}
{"text":"By far the worst Tim Horton's.   Always getting orders wrong, received open containers and expired products, inventory always low."}
{"text":"Coming from out of town, I am not used to having beggars bother you in the door way of places that we visit.  We were asked for money on the way in and out, and we did try to help by giving cash, but it was very uncomfortable.  The food was fine, the bathrooms were a disaster and the coffee was at least consistent to any other Tim Horton."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons - what else is there to say?  They renovated within the last while, and they seem to have less seating then before their renovation with their new fireplace and single chair seating.  They are situated right next to a GO train station and Home depot, so parking and driving can get really stupid.  Why? Because Safeway tours (casino Niagara bus) happens to do pick up and drop off here.  So a lot of times the parking is all full from old people going to niagara. Then with home depot, all the crazy contractors in their 4x4 trucks are whizzing around with slabs of wood sticking out the back of their truck.  This Tims is perfectly fine for a Tim's. Service, good quality and everything is as expected. But it's what surrounds it that makes it a pain to visit."}
{"text":"Parking is tough and seating is limited. This is a grab and go spot if I ever saw one. No drive thru either... triple bummer."}
{"text":"Ditto re Lisa G.'s review.  Make sure you double check your order because they've made errors in the past. Good spot though and usually the drive thru moves quickly!"}
{"text":"We bought ice cap from this location at 12.30am tonight. Service was good. We paid by visa card and that go through smooth. Ice cap taste good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food that comes out of this place, it is more fresh than most of the Tim Hortons around the area. Donuts, coffee, bagels; not to mention there is a Wendy's also attached! The issue here is that the maintenance crew needs to do a better job. There is a high amount of traffic through the doors of this place and the floors are constantly nasty and filled with mud. Common guys, mop the floors a bit so we don't drag mud all around the location. If they just clean up a bit, it would make the experience so much better!"}
{"text":"This Timmy is like all the others. You ask for what is shown on the menu board and then you are bombarded with all kinds of questions.....on a bagel, or english muffin, crusty bread etc....and when I point to the picture on the board (That has a bagel on it) I get a blank stare form the cashier. The coffee is too watered down. However, when I order doughnuts (which is the most uncomplicated thing you can do at this chain), they are ALWAYS fresh! I am not at all a fan of Tim Horton's."}
{"text":"K so this is really disgusting I usually get Timmy's muffins for lunches but not anymore I'm not after my muffin eating a lil but I noticed a long peice of human hair baked inside it so discustsing never again will I buy a muffin from Tim's not trying to pay for hair"}
{"text":"Poor service from employee.  She didn't understand what i wanted and her english wasn't that great.  She was rude!"}
{"text":"Probably the best run Tim Hortons in the city. Always super quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and Incredibly fast service make this one of the best Tim Hortons in the city. The only downside is it tends to attract a lot of students and Realtors who buy a coffee then hog the table for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"an Iced cafe latte may not be the best around but when you are looking for a quick refreshing cold drink on a hot summers day it will have to do. Top it off with a vanilla dip doughnut and it came to $4.83 after tax."}
{"text":"This review is only about my recent visit.   I only go to Tim Hortons for three reasons: sausage biscuit, ice capp, and honey cruller. On my most recent visit, I decided to change things up and tried their strawberry shortcake doughnut. It's a specialty doughnut, so it cost more than the usual. Despite its fancy presentation, the doughnut didn't live up to its name. The doughnut was, basically, two dry pieces of doughnut sandwiching whipped cream and strawberry jam. Extremely disappointing. Also, the service was unsatisfactory... The cashiers didn't even make an effort."}
{"text":"Kind of a small Tim Hortons but it is very busy here, especially on the evenings. Get used to the Long line ups."}
{"text":"On my way home i stopped by and got Some breakfast aka Sausage breakfast Sandwich in which i haven't eaten in quite a while, with some coffee on the side of course. Thank God i came here very early in the morning and avoided that morning rush.  This location is pretty small if i may say so and kept fairly clean, the storefront staff is nice and very quick. that is always a plus when going to any Tim Hortons. I think we can all relate. Other than that its just another Tim Hortons. Although i do remember The Breakfast sandwiches tasting a little bit better."}
{"text":"Staff here are very friendly and always seem to go the extra mile. Drive thru service is very fast in the morning as well. My coffee is usually always made right. Way to go!"}
{"text":"My relatives were going home back to the Philippines and we were at the airport waiting for them to go on their flight back so I decided to offer them some Timbits because they have never have tried them before.  We walk to this location inside the airport and buy 40 Timbits for us and the family.  If y'all had old Timbits, you know that if them yummy balls of goodness have been sitting there for a while, they start to have a liquidy, wet sugar coating over them.  I thought, \"This sucks\".  Their Timbits experience was not the best and I was kinda disappointed that they were not fresh.  They still enjoyed it but I did not!"}
{"text":"Staff here often looks at you like they don't know what you're saying from my experience. They classic stuff is just like any other Tim Hortons (I.e regular coffee muffins etc) but I was once served the most terrible ice coffee I've ever had here that tasted like dirty water."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about four years and it used to be great! I always left in a good mood and some of the staff working there knew me because I would come in every few weeks they even gave me calendars.  For the past few months however I have found that there customer service has gotten really bad. I know most Tim Hortons has a big line and I do not fault them for this because Tim Hortons is fairly popular.  I usually try to hit this place early to avoid the line.  Whenever I order the staff working here seem really cold. They do not say good morning it is just \"do you want a coffee\"  They always seem to give me a really bad look because I usually order a breakfast sandwich for my sister and a coffee of some sort for me and her. However I do not know why but they always seem to give me a bad look after I order and I wonder why on earth I come back here.  I have noticed lately that they have messed up my order I am usually in such a bad mood when I get my things that I do not say anything because  just want to get out of there as soon as I can.  The customer service that I have experienced here is probably the worst that I have ever come across.  I would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Maybe I've had bad luck with this Tim Horton's. I've always gotten rude customer service from specifically one server (he's usually the cashier) who gives very bad attitude. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"I love Tim Hortons for their vanilla coffee and they mapple bagel with cream cheese  This should be the new dunkin donuts"}
{"text":"Foods always pretty fresh at this location. Service is pretty fast but there is so many people I don't think I've ever not seen a line up. You can normally find seats but it's never empty. It's a good ol' Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"Ahaha, I love this Tim Hortons if only for the back story. Located in a stand-alone building in the parking lot of Sunridge Mall, it has excellent service, expecially for Timmy Ho's and the standard fare of coffee, soups and sandwiches. There is not much to complain about, a lot to love especially if you're a fan of Timmy's, so it's all good.  I like Timmy's because they make decent coffee, but I love this one for other reasons. This used to be the location of Calgary's only Krispy Kreme, which did tons of business its first year but was then surprisingly unattended and shut down fairly recently, and is now the location of yet another one of Canada's favourite donut shops (No really, it has like 80% market share). Tragic and true, and I thrilled a little when I saw it and visited just for that."}
{"text":"Timmy Ho's is ok: I'm by it all the time, but I don't check it out very often. Like most Tim Horton's, it features a line a mile long, and it takes an achingly long time to get to it. Yeah. No thanks. The coffee's decent, and during the Grey Cup I saw some straaange characters pass throug (Hi, why are you and your girlfriend dressed like Tigers? I didn't realize that there were any tiger mascots in the game...).   It's best to head over in the afternoon. I'm used to crappy service at Timmy Ho's, I just expect it - it's pretty much always bare bones. If I had to wear those uniforms, I'd be giving bad service too. They're not going out of their way to be nice, but I haven't had any overtly bad experiences like Sapna G either."}
{"text":"One of the tiniest stores that is not a kiosk.  Feel like you're walking sideways but i digress.  Like the two sets of entrance doors.  Located beside Mac's.  No drive thru."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars, despite not opening 24 hours like most of Vancouver's, this one is still not too shabby at 5:30am.  And a nice lounge area too w/ some brick tiling.  This is worth of a nice coffee date, good DT location."}
{"text":"Extra star because of its location, if you missed the free train, you can make a pit stop without waiting too long, as they have the express line here.  Not every Vancouver DT timmy's would have this...  Located in the Scotia Bank Centre office building, along with a semi-food court with a handful of other fast food places, more like in a lobby.    Just be careful of the steps coming up here."}
{"text":"older location in busy area.   bigger than it looks as it is quite deep plus the highest loft ceilings ever.  handful of free parking stalls.  ooen til midnite weekly"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Tim Hortons (which I have heard great things about). That said, this was an airport version so you have to keep that in mind.   The service was average and the food was just OK. I recommend if you have time, wait for the staff to finish making a new batch of fries (as I ended up with a luke-warm version that were rubbery).  Not bad, just OK."}
{"text":"It's a great location, strange layout, and VERY small compared to most other Tim's.  Super convenient, and in the summer, will be busy busy.  For now, they seem to be out of about everything. Today, for example, they only had one soup. They never have crullers or Himalayan Salted Caramel Timbits, they don't at all seem to be a full-service Tim's but nothing in their screens suggest they're smaller. They split the lines fairly effectively, so it's not a big deal for the weather (referring to a post below), but the auto-sliding doors do keep it cold in there if people stand too near the door on the inside or outside.  Glad it's so near the river and TTC, but sure wish it had everything the bigger stores have.  [edit to my review] I just tried calling to reserve two Take Ten boxes, and they want me to call in the morning. Additionally, they only serve 3 types of Timbits there, and \"we're always out of the Salted Caramel, so can't guarantee we'll have 50 assorted in the morning.\"  Person who answered the phone didn't know what a Take Ten box is, and the manager who took the phone from the barely-speaking English employee didn't want a phone reservation for an early morning pickup \"because it usually only takes 2 minutes to fill the boxes.\" He must live on a different Tim planet, as it usually takes around 10-15 mins to get two boxes filled."}
{"text":"Super efficient location!! Well run, always clean and even when there's a line up- it moves quickly.  Most importantly- they are consistent with the food and you seem the same faces almost every time. They seem happy to work there and not pissed off teenagers that would rather be somewhere else (like the Pincourt location!) Nothing worse than being served by someone who hates their job.  Good job- and you may need to keep it up as McDonalds has a coffee that tastes better and they're right beside you ;)"}
{"text":"Donut holes were pretty good.   Though the Blueberry fritter was sub par."}
{"text":"Unbelievable lack of customer service skills First off MENU items shouldn't be off limits to customers at 8:00 pm when the place closes at 9:30 Get the closing procedures bc I am in the restaurant business  So to rush on there close they stop serving soups bc it's to hard to clean fast at 9:30  However it's wrong & when your told we don't serve soup bc we close at 9:30 & it's 8:00 pm is a crock of shit... always issues at this location Staff need to learn that those doors  wouldn't open without us That being CUSTOMERS   Back again on June 23  What a shit show that place is 5 staff  Front entrance is disgusting paper all over the floor straws on the floors  Front door is so dirty & can I say 5 staff standing around  WHO OWNS THIS PLACE   WHAT A DISGUSTING place  I'm in the business & can't believe people actually sit in this nastiness  Good job Tim Hortons  The owner of that place must just have never been in the restaurant business  Must have money & no give a rats ass"}
{"text":"Whaaat? There's something called the \"famous\" Tim Hortons in Toronto???  Well I'll admit, they do have some interesting add-ons such as a self serve kiosk and a express line. Service was good as well, but that's about it. I mean, you'd expect these things from a Tim Hortons to get 3 stars. Nothing special at all.  Oh, I'm 0 for 1 for Roll Up the Rim. Grumble."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service  This Timmies definitely looks like it's new, judging by the design. It was the closest Timmies to my hotel during my stay in Calgary, and I decide to have breakfast before going on with my day.  The employees were definitely very welcoming, and greeted good morning with a smile to everyone. There were also regulars, and the employees knew a lot of regular faces. It was also busy, which wasn't too surprising for 8:00 in the morning.  I had a sausage croissant...at least, I thought I ordered a sausage croissant. When I received it, I noticed it was an egg croissant instead. I was thinking of asking for an exchange, until I saw the lineup growing even larger...so I decided to let it slide. The food was good though, even if my order was incorrect."}
{"text":"A wonderful spot if you've a penchant for white kids smoking ganja/blasting Lil Wayne from their souped-up cars with money from mommy and daddy. As for the service, the employees used to consistently find a way to mess up my order in one way or another. In the last year, they've cleaned up their act a bit though."}
{"text":"Very nice looking location. Nice staff (unlike most Tim Hortons). And special products I haven't seen anywhere else (I.e., \"Premium Coffee Cake Tulip\" muffin!).  Coffee is also consistently good here. Who knew."}
{"text":"The closest Tim's to work.  It always seems to be busy probably due to the proximity to high schools and various offices.   It's an a-ok place; well stocked with bagels, donuts, and Timbits. In spite of the long line, employees were quick."}
{"text":"Closest Tim's to to OISE. I'm taking a weekend course at OISE so I grab a tea and/or lunch from here. It's packed. Service could be faster. More seats would be great too. By the washroom, there are some homeless people who seem to sit here all day. Does the trick when I want my tea.  Good for: coffee, tea, donuts"}
{"text":"Newly renovated.... Close to Bedford side of st George station, good to have a cheap coffee in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"The crispy chicken was alright  I didn't like their bun and it was kind of expensive for $5  something for just the sandwich itself. I choose the spicy one and they just put some spicy powder and sauce on a original chicken filet, and overall it wasn't that spicy at all."}
{"text":"What's the point of opening this one if they don't have paninis or breakfast sandwiches? It would be a lot better to close down coffee time near Coxwell and Danforh and replace that with Tim hortons."}
{"text":"It's a typical Tim's so we all know what the food tastes like. It's pretty clean, with a nice big outdoor terrace.   Why 4 stars?  The woman that served us this morning was awesome! Smiling, joking and very patient with our undecided 10 year old. Love being served by someone with a great smile on their face."}
{"text":"Não há cafeteria melhor no mundo do que um Tim Hortons! Meu vício, literalmente!  Um sabor incrível, uma delicia! Preço? Mega barato!!!!!!!!!  Recomendo pedir o Maple Cinnamon com recheio de Cream Cheese e de bebida o tradicional French Vanilla..  Lugar maravilhoso, super indico!"}
{"text":"This Tim's is located in a plaza and has a drive thru. I usually come here in the morning (before 6am), and the service is prompt.   Tip: watch out for people who decide to walk in front of your car before you pull out of the drive through. Especially those who decide to dress in full black and with no reflective clothing in the dark, and who just walk assuming you'll see them..."}
{"text":"This location is understaffed. You can tell that the cashiers try, but there are just way too many people. Located in a plaza with a gas station, people fill up then come in for a coffee - making this location busier than others. It doesn't help that this location also has drive through service.   Management NEEDS to address this issue and hire more staff.   Two stars because the cashiers are clearly trying to serve all of the customers, otherwise I would've given one star for the location being short-staffed resulting in the line reaching all the way to the doorway."}
{"text":"Some friends were in the Halifax area and they couldn't pronounce the town that they were in, something long and very Danish. So at the next outlet they were at, they asked their server to pronounce the name of the place they were at really slowly so that they could understand.  The girl said of course, Tiiiiiimmmmmmm Hoooorrrtoooons...Hahaha  I love that story.  And with that said I do love Tim Hortons, no matter where I am in Canada, driving on the highway across Canada especially in Ontario-land, the Timmy Ho sign is really comforting to see.  I have been to this location several times and I like the staff here, most of them know my Aunt by name, she is a TH regular, so there is always some sort of story that will be fed to us on the side of our coffee.   I have had sandwiches, doughnuts and the chili here and I can proclaim that everything has been pretty fresh and delicious.  And I must admit I do love a Tim Horton's coffee, it smells so good and just goes down so smoothly.  I haven't yet been to other locations in the city, but I have had consistantly great service and great food at this Timmy HO's."}
{"text":"This is a remarkably busy Tims, one of the busiest I've been to (and if you look at my reviews, I've been to a few!)  Despite the chaos, the employees were calm and the service efficient.  Food is Tims food, coffee is hot and the breakfast sandwiches tasty."}
{"text":"A little bit chaotic and disorganized. I ordered a sandwich and ended up with a wrap. I am not sure if it was because it was so busy (which it was, they were pretty slammed,) or if the employees lacked adequate training. They seemed to be out of everything and were slow on getting things resupplied. I would probably avoid this one in the future unless I was desperate or just wanted coffee."}
{"text":"We were in the area needing some coffee and a couple of muffins for an afternoon snack, and this Tims was nearby. No complaints from us, coffee was hot and good, and muffins were good. Staff was really friendly, and we spent some time chilling out inside. No complaints."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Tims.  It's nice and easy to get in and out, and it's not that busy. Bathrooms are nice and clean, and the food is standard, nothing outstanding, but not bad either."}
{"text":"This is a pretty busy Tim's, but the service was perfectly nice and our orders were fine, the food was hot and par for the course for a Tim's.   There are a ton of kids loitering in the parking lot, but I really don't consider that the fault of the business. There are other businesses in this strip mall, so there really isn't much that can be done."}
{"text":"This is a Tim Horton's. It does what Tim Horton's does. Coffee & food that you don't want to eat but is convenient.   It's location is at a gas station so you will be inclined to purchase if you didn't pay at the pump. There is nothing special or outstanding. There is nothing wrong neither.  Will return if I decide to pay at the counter and there is no line up."}
{"text":"I work near here and for some time I would come here to get a coffee and a sesame bagel with sausage patty. It was a good price and pretty decent.  A year ago I went to order this, and the lady at the cash was struggling to enter the order. Another person came to help out and asked for the order again, which I provided without stress as I was not in a hurry.  The second woman struggled again and used an extremely derogatory term in arabic which I will not repeat here. I confronted the manager about this for which she apologized.  Upon getting back to work I noticed they had put no milk or sugar in my coffee. I went back to ask for them to add some. They then added so much sugar it was undrinkable.  I have not been going back since. I think using intensely derogatory terms and taking vengeance after on a client is unnaceptable even more so when it's done in front of the manager."}
{"text":"Most disrespectful staff and manager I have ever seen. They blatantly make fun of customers and don't care if we see them doing it. Won't brother to help out a customer in need. Some people skills won't hurt to have in this type of business... won't be returning here"}
{"text":"Another Tim Hortin's I frequent out of convenience but unfortunately probably consistently the worst I've been to.   The location itself is so awkward to get into; a very tiny parking lot east of Rogers on Weston rd not very far from the intersection which gets rather busy especially with the current \"construction situation\". This  makes entry perilous at times, the parking lot itself becomes gridlocked because of the design of the drive thru, this alone makes this location super inconvenient.  But worst of all is the service here, I can't count the amount of times I've been inconvenienced enough to further inconvenience myself by going back to complain. I've received sour milk and cream here with management arguing with me that the curdled milk in my cup must be my doing somehow. Honestly Im not expecting much more then to receive what I ordered with decent service but I've never met more miserable people and it seems to only gets worse. I've heard many say to me... It's just a coffee shop but it doesn't deter me from expecting basic competence and human decency.   Do yourself a favor and be sure to check your order, especially when going through the drive thru here"}
{"text":"Yeah an average Timmy in the neighbourhood. Nothing to bitch about but wish a better store display and decoration. Right now it feels very crowded and loud"}
{"text":"Very good location within the downtown area. The store itself is quite spacious and provides a good amount of space for people to sit. The workers and staff are friendly. Location is also close by to many other stores and areas which makes it convenient. Their donuts are far more better than dunkin donuts and that glaze is on point."}
{"text":"This location is always fast & friendly . After a lot of trial and comparison, I've found that this location makes some of the best ice caps!"}
{"text":"awful place!!!    nobody spoke English, no available tables to sit.  Full of middle eastern men speaking another language (Loudly)   taking up tables playing dominoes and cards.       Wednesday at 9pm - felt like you'd walked into an international airport , disgusting.    Staff (2ppl) were very busy with drive thru window. Polite and efficient. I'd guess students working part-time. They should get awards for working there! Suggest police presence, for the illegals, someone phone immigration.   ## omigod at 10pm a Van pulls up outside and ten people scurry out to it like rats## employment job van??!!  wtf"}
{"text":"Tim Horton, best coffee shop in Canada! This Tim Horton I will only suggests to do take out, because the waiting time is surprisingly slow. Especially for breakfast time. Will go again, but when is not in a rush mood."}
{"text":"Service was ok, not super fast... Had Wifi hotspot at this tim Horton... Why 3 stars because there's no power outlet!!!! I mean hello???? Seriously? Starbucks is way more thoughtful than this..."}
{"text":"People are OK but they don't pay attention when you tell him it's too cold in here in the middle of winter when it's 68°F it seems like nobody gives a damn ** update it seems someone listened it's now set at the right temperature"}
{"text":"Canada's version of Dunkin Donuts.  Way better!  There's that French pastry taste and touch to these so-called fast food treat.  While in Montreal recently, there was a gas station across the street from the hotel, so before leaving I had to get me some. Unlike some in the U.S., the gas station here was clean, without the sketchiness.   It was early enough in the am (9am ish) so I was able to get some donuts that looked good. Already the donut selection was getting minimal. I chose the strawberry shortcake 'beignes' and crueller. The strawberry jelly came with chunks of fruit and the whipped cream was the real thing.  It was my fav among the two I chose.  I came in a little later with my travel buddy since she also wanted to try the donut and get some coffee.  It looked liked they made more donuts. It was still the same small selection, yet a good variety.  They also have Timbits, equivalent to Munchkins.  I  bought a third donut, the 'originale' which was a plain donut.  Fresh and classically good! As an afterthought, I should've bought myself an ice-coffee.  It looked so goooD!  They also make sandwiches as well as other sweet treats like a version of a mini croissant in either nutella or chocolate, muffins and cookies.  Recommended when you're in Canada, for a quick fix of coffee and donuts!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Came in as a group around 7AM and the person who took our order was super rude. I couldn't get her name since she covered her name tag (she was cross eyed). I ordered a small iced coffee with 4 sugar and she said, in a snarky rude way, that the sugar will catch up to me in old age and that I do not need that much sugar. On top of that she didn't let my friend order with me despite the fact that we came together. She made him go back to the line and wait his turn when he literally came in with us."}
{"text":"I love the coffee here. Loved the croissant. Tim Hortons has its own special charm and taste in its coffee. Whenever I go to Starbucks, I order my usual which is caffe latte or cafe mocha with whipped cream and a hint of cinnamon on the top of it.   I tried the same order at Tim Hortons too. It was fantastic and I wasn't disappointed. This coffee shop is a very busy one, being inside the Montreal convention center and close to the metro train station. It's so convenient to everyone to grab a scone or a croissant or a sandwich with a cup of coffee on their way to work or to the conference for a refreshing start of the day.   I never tried the bagels there, but heard they were good. Maybe next time I sure have to try it out. It was my Togo place whenever I come to attend a conference at the convention center.   Large seating area to accommodate a lot of coffee lovers :)  -SH"}
{"text":"Line system is confusing and tons of people constantly butt in front of me. However the wait time for the food if you can actually order is good, and the quality is what you expect. Staff is really nice to me but it's hard to find a clean table to sit at sometimes."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect but they manage to keep up with the crazy downtown pace. Even when its lined up out the door you'll be at the till within a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"Brutal service and horrible quality... Food not fresh... Stopped ordering after many attempts.. Only use the drive through for tea now"}
{"text":"Man this location is so slow.. not even a busy rush this morning .. waited more than 15 mins just for a breakfast combo. The staff is all over the place and what I think they are under staffed . Not a good location to goto."}
{"text":"This place gets super busy. However, the service was still good, the drinks were perfectly prepared and we got everything within a reasonable amount of time. Gotta love Tim Hortons :)"}
{"text":"so, where I'm from we do not have Tim Hortons,  I was pretty excited to try another coffee chain besides Starbucks..   The good thing about this place is that they offer a larger selection of sandwiches and breakfast items along with free Wi- Fi!! Yeeeaaaah! (thanks to that I was able to check in on yelp  ).. the coffee is decent and they offer a few different options , however, their coffee menu is not very extensive.  I'm personally not very picky with coffee so I would not have any problem coming back to this place..   Tip of the day: If you order a cup of coffee do not throw away your cup without unfolding the sipping line.. you could be a lucky winner and earn free coffee or even cash!!! *--- if you win cash, don't forget to messages me and give me at least 10% ;) - GOOD LUCK!"}
{"text":"Service is ok. Coffee is nice and hot!  Table we sat at had crumbs on chairs and table.  Free wifi!!  Seating setup is nice, there are 2 comfy chairs next to the fireplace. Big tv over the fireplace that shows tims TV. It shows a bit of news, and a lot of tims ads.  3.5 stars for visit."}
{"text":"So been here 5 days straight.  9am consistantly.  Pretty busy at this time. Parking is good, but exit out back to mullock sometimes is a headache.   My decaf is always Hot !! Cashiers are quick and efficient!"}
{"text":"Great location if you're looking for decent selection and quick service. I'm usually in and out of this location within five minutes even with a long line up. The store is teeny tiny, but the customers there looked comfortable clustered together 5 at a table.  I get freaked out coming here sometimes though... even during the day time. The lot always seems to be full of taxis and sketchy looking people on the weekends."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick breakfast before catching my flight.  It was crazy busy making the Starbucks across the way look like a graveyard.  The crowds can't be wrong and they were not.  My Egg Muffin clone was excellent and the coffee was adequate.  Honestly the staff didn't have time to be overly friendly they were totally slammed with business.  The area was mostly clean but the sheer number of people eating was outpacing the ability for the worker to keep things perfect.  I think they did a great job considering the environment."}
{"text":"Across the road from Toronto Western Hospital and a pretty big Timmies. There's lots of seating and many of the tables are by the windows so I've gotten to like it for lunch. On a sunny day it's toasty warm and lovely and bright if you sit along the Dundas side. Staff are pretty nice (it's Tim Hortons-what do you expect?), lines are less bad than in the hospital and the food and drinks are the same as everywhere else. Horrible coffee and great steeped tea with thawed doughnuts.  Clientele is mixed so I'm not sure I'd be that crazy about it late at night...but it's fine during the day."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. For the third winter break, I celebrated the holidays with my fiance's family here in Toronto. Yet this was the first time I tried Tim Hortons! I'd always assumed Tim Hortons to be the equivalent of Dunkin Donuts in the states. I was pleasantly surprised by its quality when we stopped by for a quick lunch. The place was bright and clean. It reminded me a bit more Panera Bread except for the fact that we have to serve ourselves instead and the menu had more grab to go items.   Its menu not only had all the same items as DD but it also had lasagna, soup combo! My fiance went with their grilled cheese on whole wheat and chicken noodle soup. I went with a chicken salad on whole wheat and a vanilla parfait. The rest of the family got lasagna, plain bagel with cream cheese, and cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese, along with maple cream and twisted glazed donuts. Although my vanilla parfait didn't come with any granola and the bagel + sandwiches + donuts were much smaller than what I am used to in the states - they were all made to order and tasty. I can definitely see myself visiting Tim Hortons regularly for a quick bite and coffee."}
{"text":"There is nothing worse than finally getting you Timmy's coffee on the morning and, after you have driven away, you realize the cream is off or it is burnt. 100% of the trips I have made to this location have been burnt/bad. Service is fast but maybe if they slowed down from racing to take your money and tried their coffee this would not be a problem. I hate slagging a Timmy's but this location is just not worth the trip, keep driving."}
{"text":"Never Hortons-ed before but it's not such a bad deal: cup of coffee and two cheesey bicuits will get me to lunch for less than $4.00 Coffee is blazing hot so it will be a while before I know if it's any good; first impression is that the urns need scraped and bleached but it was close enough to good after it cooled off a bit. My biscuit was fresh and soft with good mouth feel and chew and plenty of cheesey bits throughout. Would have been better toasty warm with a flaky crust but since it wasn't advertised that way it's just me dreaming out loud... Maybe gotta find out when they come out of the oven for hot and steamy pleasures."}
{"text":"Worst Tim Hortons I have been to in a long time. Service is horrible! They had over 10 people on the floor but only on poor girl was actually working. I stood around waiting to get my wrap order for almost 20 minutes while other customers came and went. Owner gave a shitty excuse that they were training...sorry you shouldn't be training during the busiest time of year!"}
{"text":"I went at the perfect time, there was no line. I ordered a chocolate glazed donut and a Creamy chocolate chill. It was delicious. I usually go for the timbits but wasn't feeling it today. The chill was awesome with the chocolate whipped cream. After eating my donut, I went back just to see what their timbit flavors were and the lady asked me, \"did you get the wrong donut?\" I laughed and told her I was just looking around.   After my mum and aunt were done shopping for souvenirs, they grabbed coffee, soup, and a sandwich. Not sure exactly what they had but they enjoyed it. Something to keep them warm.   Friendly staff and great food!"}
{"text":"Recently my company sent me to Toronto for a conference. I had a couple of friends who had attended the University here so I began to quiz them on what I should see or do while in town.  My ultimate to-do list outside of work hours looked like this: 1. Tim Hortons - Ice Capp 2. Poutine 3. Walk around Kensington Market area  Well, having briefly resided in NJ, I can tell you that Poutine is really just a slightly better version of Disco Fries. But Tim Horton's ice capp...man, I don't think anything I have ever purchased from a chain restaurant has quite lived up to the hype like this. It was so wonderful, and at $1.89 (even taking into account the exchange rate, which I'm going to assume is negligible.) it was both more delicious and cheaper then anything I have ever purchased at a Starbucks.   You go Tim Horton's. Oh, and welcome to NYC. I'll have to check out your locations in my hometown  soon and see if they compare. Or if, like Guinness, they'll never be quite the same in the states."}
{"text":"Open till 11pm per the sign out front! Time appears to be wrong on Yelp. Your basic Timmies. The only downside for this location is you can't turn in directly from highway 7 since it's in the plaza."}
{"text":"Convenient Tim Hortons if you're a pedestrian on this busy section of Yonge St. The inside of the store was clean and the staff made sure that my iced capp didn't have any of it dripping down the sides before they handed it to me."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons in Montreal is kind of like the Dunkin Donuts in Boston, they are quite literally at every corner of the street. They sell quite an variety of pastries, chocolate bread, muffins, and donuts. The sizes here are usually half of what you would find in a DD, quite fresh and perfect for a snack. Both cold and hot drinks are available from latte to hot chocolate, from smoothies to ice coffee. Although equally as popular as DD in the US, it has less of a fast food type of feel to it, quite cozy and warm."}
{"text":"Funny thing about this location - it used to be a Second Cup....  Super fast, super clean and BIG....this is like the King of Timmy's in the city.    The staff are very friendly, they are fast and very accurate.  The place gets at least the 2 office towers attached to it worth of ppl between the hours of 8:30-9:30 and they never mis a beat.  They are fast, organized and seem to be enjoying their jobs.  They have a huge selection - including The Leafs Game Day Donuts and there is enough seats to accommodate about 30 -50 ppl.  This store reminds me of a suburban location in the heart of the city.  By far the best one I have been to in Toronto."}
{"text":"If you're looking for me between 8:50 and 9:00am on a Saturday or Sunday - stake out this place and you'll see me.  This is my weekend Timmy's...on the way to the dog park, rain or shine, snowstorm or bright summer day.  The staff is great - depending on who you get helping you.   They have a manager there who is as sharp as a tack.  She is all over it, and even remembers my order.  They are friendly and as fast as they can be.  The selection is limited, but they have the staples - they are a small location....  The layout sucks, but if they were to expand they wouldn't make the same money they are now.  There is about 50 feet of standing room and that's it.  Located at the bottom of the Primrose, they get hotel traffic, street traffic and streetcar traffic since they are located at the 506 Carlton eastbound stop.  If you're in the hood, this is the Timmy's to go to."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't visit this location so often if it weren't five minutes away from my girlfriend's place.  They've renovated the place and replaced a large portion of the customer service staff.  Customer service is remarkably bad, even after completely remaking the customer service team.  For some reason, there will be a line and the person behind the cashier will complete the previous transaction, then leave while there's a line of two or more people.  This continues to be a problem for seemingly no reason.  They move really slow here and have a tendency to forget items - always check before you leave.  In addition, they almost always never have all three soups that are advertised on their board.  It's not hard - if you don't have it, remove it.  Last time I went, they also forgot our order and then proceeded to mess it up when we did get it - cold potato wedges, a steak sandwich with very little steak and again, no soup.  Just getting your food is way too much of a chore.  If you can afford to, visit a different location.  How you can mess up Tim Hortons is beyond me."}
{"text":"They have basically everything you'd expect of a Tim Hortons but there are a few things that set this one a little different than a few others I've been to.  This location can be pretty busy because it's in the middle of a lot of little stores and businesses so I wouldn't recommend going at prime time lunch hour.  A lot of the construction in the area's done so it isn't quite as dirty as it used to be - which was noted in a few pictures here.  One positive here is that the staff members are extremely friendly - which I find to be a pretty inconsistent thing at other locations.  They always smile, which is a huge plus.  One really strange thing is that they seem to run out of products a lot...   Or I just have terrible luck. This is easily the closest location to my house and once they didn't have white bread (for my ham & swiss sandwich).  Something more recent is that they discontinued having ranch dressing for my ham & swiss, which has resulted me in not going for lunch anymore.  For some reason, they never have the soups they have displayed.  They'll usually have three or four soups posted and they'll be missing one or two of them on any given day.  Once, they didn't have any of the four posted and instead, had a different three there.  Look, if you're not going to use your own board properly, don't use it at all.  The parking lot is pretty big so you'll always have a place to park.  If you go around dinner time, you might find that you won't have a place to sit, since this location's pretty small.  There's always takeout, which I don't mind seeing as I live five minutes away.  Something extra to keep in mind is that if you live west along Major Mac, you'll want to leave the plaza out the south exit and go east to Kennedy, turn left (at the traffic light) there, then go west on Major Mac from there..  Turning left onto Major Mac straight from Prospector's Drive has been a nightmare for me sometimes.  This location bugs me a little bit because they're terribly inconstantly with their soups, plus they don't have the ranch for my sandwich anymore.  Fix those and I'll return more often.  Until then, I'll probably visit other locations should I want a soup."}
{"text":"Classic Canadian that makes me wanna shout \"Oooooooooh Caaaanadaaaaa\" at the top of my lungs. Enjoy in moderation!"}
{"text":"What a welcome home, to have a Canadian Coffee company beverage, and paying Canadian dollars for it! Tim Hortons prices are competitive with other companies."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. The lady that makes the sandwiches there is very grouchy. I ordered hash brown to go with my sandwich, I swear this is not suitable for eating. It was soggy, greasy and soft, not the crispy ones as expected. I return it to the lady and kindly asked if she could please put it in the toaster for a few minutes to brown it a bit more. She placed it in the warmer, and not the toaster  for a minute and gave it back to me. The hash brown was undercooked and flappy and soft. She told me that it came from head office and this is the way that it has always been served. Can you believe her? She gave me a very annoyed look. I told her that if this is the way their hash brown is, then she should eat it herself. I ended up getting my few cents back! Going to Starbucks.. the sandwiches there taste better."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the worst Tim's I've ever been to.  I can't count the times where I've received my orders wrong in spectacular fashion. I don't know who is doing the hiring here, but the staff on a regular basis are unfriendly, slow, and forgetful.  I only go to this location because of its proximity to my office but I swear if I win the lottery one day. I will buy a franchise to rival this location.  Just at the sheer mention of this location in my office kicks off a long and complicated \"Bitch-fest\" (for lack of a better term) where we all complain when we've been wronged by the lack of service here.   Am I being too harsh? Probably, but all I ask for is to get my order correctly (somewhat) consistently. I shouldn't be entering an engagement with this location with the expectation of a mix-up. That's all I'm asking."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and I have been eating here in the morning because it's close. I checked the reviews and they seem pretty old.  I think the service is pretty good and they got my food out on time. The ladies at the register are you nice. in fact, I just watched them fix a problem of a customer that had a complaint from a DIFFERENT store. The customer got the wrong bagel, got on the subway, and then came into this Tom Hortons and want the woman at the register to give her the right bagel. The fixed her request very quickly.  It does seem like they get busy around 8am for breakfast and there was a line out the door. The employee were scrambling around to fulfill orders. They did a great job. I will keep coming."}
{"text":"Agree with the reviews here, seems fair. Food is standard but customer service and employee knowledge/communication is lacking.   We dined in and the workers didn't even know their own combos. Very small dining space for the amount of people they are accommodating, and line up was pretty crazy (could barely fit everyone in the building). Ended up ordering a small iced coffee with less ice, employee ended up adding half a cup of ice and didn't bother mixing in the syrup in the end."}
{"text":"The worst neighbours. The absolute worst. They don't shovel A FLAKE of snow and must assume that it's up to the city to clear the sidewalks abutting their business, which sits on a corner lot. Oh, they do clear the snow on the little path to the parking area to the side and leading to their front entrance ON THEIR PROPERTY, but the public sidewalk that they're legally required to clear? Nope. They don't touch it. Despicable. The \"food\" donuts and coffee are the same garbage as at every TH.TH has to understand that this location isn't in some suburban strip mall but on 17th, the most vibrant pedestrian street in Calgary."}
{"text":"Normal timmies. Nothing spectacular. There are times when the lines are pretty large however and sometimes it's quicker to park and go inside to get your coffee.   Still there's free wifi and ample space inside. The service is okay. I've been to far worse.   Good, cheap, fast."}
{"text":"The coffee was good. Donuts were fresh and delicious. The prices are acceptable. I will back for sure. Was our first time in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Tim Horton's in Toronto. The reason? Friendly / reliable staff. I have never had a problem with my orders at this location. The place is clean, the staff are nice, the food is above par for Tim Hortons... My only complaint is the washrooms are single occupancy only so there is sometimes a lineup to use the toilet."}
{"text":"Went to this Tim Hortons for lunch. It is a typical Tim Hortons location, but not as crowded as other locations. There are plenty of seating every time I come here.  I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. They ran out of the crispy chicken sandwich sauce, so they put on extra mayo? The sandwich was okay, but it took them 7-8 minutes to make the sandwich.  Would I come back? Yes, because it is never crowded and there is plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This is a very busy Tim Horton's. The cashiers are very friendly, though they don't speak very good English so you may have a bit difficulty ordering. We especially had trouble ordering a shot of Hazelnut in our coffee. After looking at the menu again, we tried to pronounce it in French, noisette, to which she eventually understood what we wanted. If you choose to stay, all food is served on ceramic plates, making it feel like a cafe. The pastries and coffee are all made fairly typical to the Tim Horton's standard. There is no place to put your garbage or plates so it can get a bit messy as some people leave their trays on the table or just put it along the cafeteria-style counter."}
{"text":"Don't know how anyone can drink their coffee.  Tastes like _shit and even somewhat burned.    Can't beat Starbucks or even McDonalds coffee.  Anything other than Tim's!"}
{"text":"1 star is too much for this place. Very very rude staff. They get the orders wrong.  At the drive thru they pretty much throw the food at you and   Roll their eyes ( specially this one south asian lady who is mostly at the drive thru window)She shoves  the food at you. At one time she let the coffee go before I caught it and it fell. So she rolls  her eyes up, no apology and gives me another coffee  this time with the lid so loose it drip all around  when she hands it over.  They seem to work like a gang there. Very unpleasant"}
{"text":"I go in there when I am desperate, and only when I am desperate.  This Tim's has gone from bad to worse.  Give yourself LOTS of time to order a coffee.  You can get old waiting in the lineup here."}
{"text":"Washroom was in dire need of attention.  Still the same plastic piece of something lying near the door as it was last week.  Did not even want to wash my hands there.  Gave me the creeps.  Had a overall unkempt and uncared appearance - it needed attention.  Actual store -- there was something on the edge of the counter that looked like caked-on jam or something (whatever it was was off-putting).  Door from behind the counter (which people were touching), to the kitchen looked greasy from where I was standing.  Now the best.  After waiting and waiting ... and waiting ... I was told \"just wait\" for my latte.  I was so infuriated.  Who is the customer here?  This is one nasty store.  I will never go back.  Made a scene.  In 37 years of frequenting Tim's on a regular basis, this was the first really majorly off-putting experience.  I have been to Tim's where the service was faster or slower, but it was the attitude, and overall lack of appeal that just made me want to escape from there as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Sheraton Parkway next door.  Stopped by to buy donut and milk for the kids. Donut was very good.  Bought 4 bottles of milk .  Opened 1 and noticed 3 out of 4 were out of date. Returned the milk and NOTIFIED the cashiers.  Came back the next day and they sold us the same 3 out of dated milk; even the one that I opened on the previous day.  Coffee was bland and lukewarm."}
{"text":"Get a receipt for everything you buy and make sure all the items are on your tray before you sit down. The staff seem nice enough, it's probably just bad training and bad habits."}
{"text":"First thought coming in here, it's just likely Dunkin Donuts in America! BUT BETTER!!!  Yes, the other 2 reviews are right, it is a little dirty and this place doesn't generate the highest class of customers, but com'on, it's selling $1-2 cups of coffee, what do you expect.   My limited time in Canada and experience in Tim Hortons makes me wish there was one in Florida. But I love their iced coffee, it's exactly how I like it, and it tasted amazing even without any flavoring added.   The TimBits (small donut holes) were good, they taste how I imagine donut holes would taste like. I did end up trying their Crispy Chicken Sandwich before I went back to the states, not the most amazing chicken sandwich I've ever had, but it was tasty.   My mom and I never had a problem with service, the cashier was also nice and the coffee always came out within a minute or two and the food would take about 5ish minutes unless it was a donut. Oh, and I love the fact that they serve real food here for breakfast and lunch (I.e. breakfast sandwiches and cold cut deli sandwiches).   I miss Tim Hortons already, can I make a petition for them to bring it to America?"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Tim Hortons I've been too. There's always huge lines at this location. So the employees always slack off on making the food and drinks to the best.   When I order Bagged tea from here, they never stir the tea. So there's always sugar at the bottom of the cup and it's never sweet enough.   I ordered my typical BLT on a croissant recently. They did not toast my croissant, they just heated it in the microwave. This made the sandwich really hot and soggy.     Additionally, the portion of meat and lettuce was really little. There was literally one piece of lettuce and one, maybe two pieces of bacon. Totally disappointed. I felt like I was scammed. Overpriced for the portion."}
{"text":"I only use the drive through for this location as the line ups are not that long. Sometimes there are no lineups in the A.M. as the plaza is tucked away. Maybe I shouldn't mention this in Yelp. Hmm.    The staff are efficient, friendly and they have never messed up my order. Will always come by if there is a Timmys craving!"}
{"text":"I have been in at least 100 tim hortons before east coast to west coast and who writes a review for a placa that has standard servics but this place deserves it. Best bagel i have eaten.seriously. and customer service was great. They dont just slap things around make something and sell it to you. Well done. I hope to come here again"}
{"text":"This is going to be a fairly short review...  It's a pretty standard Tim Hortons. Offers fast and friendly service and it tends to be empty due to its location. It makes a great place to come study or read a book! I must warn that they tend to crank the air conditioning, so bring a sweater!"}
{"text":"Having walked around the city all afternoon. My aunt and I were walking by and decided to get a smoothie and pastry here.   True, like the previous reviews, the line was long as it's in a central location. But there were two cashiers and got our order in quickly.   A little confusion where to get our drinks (from our cashier, apparently!) but we had no trouble with anything. They were polite and it was clean as you could expect a fast food throw place to be. My apple apple fritter and smoothie were delicious, and even the bathroom was pretty clean."}
{"text":"Food is average to pretty good for a Timmy's (and there are a few Timmy's locations that are very good to excellent), though sometimes this location runs out on certain types of donuts, muffins, and sandwich bread by the mid to late afternoon. The customer service is often slow and they take way too long to have your order ready, even for the simplest of orders. The WIFI is at least generally reliable. Often pretty crowded too, despite the lack of customer service and food quality. Not one of my top choices for a Timmy's and generally avoid it if I can."}
{"text":"It's Tim Horton's, can't go wrong. This place was also just renovated last year, and is very large, great to bring a laptop."}
{"text":"One of the busier Tim Horton's in Oakville, but other then that it isn't that bad.  Because this Tim's has to deal with a lot of rude teens, being nice goes a long way. I think every Canadian has a soft spot for Timmy's. Cheap and simply. And good. And on every corner. Medium french vanilla and whole wheat raspberry muffin please!"}
{"text":"Awful Timmie's location. Shame because it seems like it has a lot of potential. Everyday this week they've managed to either mess up my order or take a tremendously long time taking it. The employees are fairly kind and seem to be trying but management needs to either train them a bit better or hire a few better employees. Keep in mind I've only been here in the later hours, so I can't speak for during the day. Nothing is consistent here. The food selection late at night is decent though and they are open 24/7, so I'll give them that."}
{"text":"This is a tiny spot of Tim Hortons located inside Pape Station, and accessible from both inside and outside of the station:  Pro: if you were in a rush and forgot to eat breakfast, or just want to grab a cup of coffee on your way to whereverland, this place is really convenient and quick... HOWEVER  Cons: the lineup can pile up during rush hour, or when buses and subway trains unload.  Also, the service can be CRAP at times during regular hours (specifically from the cash counter within the station) where the employees barely give you any attention because they are busy chatting with each other. Sometimes you just have to yell \"EXCUSE MEEE\""}
{"text":"Not bad, but:   1. they are often running out of items (cookies mostly)... 2. parking is shared with other stores on the plaza and capacity  is so-so at best.  Definitely some room to improve, but I'll keep popping by every now and then."}
{"text":"I've got a 2 hour layover so armed with my trusty ipad I decided to review this box restaurant. I usually don't review places like this. They are all the same to me.  Food is on the average side. I ordered a chilli, coffee, and a donut.  The food tastes the same as every other T Hortons I've been to. That's the advantage of these box restaurants, generally there are no surprises.   My tirade is going to be on the service staff. These women are awful!  The counter person who served me did not dare look me in the eyes when addressing me. Avoiding eye contact, looking down, she mumbled something incoherent to me. I had to ask her twice what she was trying to say to me. She wanted to know what kind of bun do I want with my chilli.... Whole wheat or white.  I know many of the counter people who work at T Hortons are immigrants working for min wage and they are working long hours, but have a bit of empathy!  A weary traveler would certainly appreciate a friendly smile and a sweet disposition!  I think showing that you're happy can make you feel happy!  Just food for thought....  Something to think about on your next coffee break."}
{"text":"tim hortons has yet to realize that bagels have holes in the middle. They always just put a big clump of cream cheese in the hole and nowhere else on the bagel."}
{"text":"I come here most mornings for a bagel & tea, and I've never had any problems! It's a pretty standard Tim Hortons, fairly clean, quick & convenient. It's not often busy, so good for a fast breakfast or lunch - or just a break from the cold outside :)"}
{"text":"Worst Tim Hortons ever. Very slow and always dirty. Always get my order wrong as well. Always the same people who hang out there open ti closing time. Bunch of low lives there. Obviously locals who have been living in that shitty area all their lives. They always let this woman pan handle all the time in and on property as well. Train your staff more carefully!!"}
{"text":"The are very hard to understand and I usually have to repeat my order multiple times. Workers get frustrated and treat you like you are bothering them. The staff is extremely rude and my orders are usually wrong 80% of the time, even after repeating it multiple times. I actually drive further out of my way instead of going to this location now. This is by far one of the worst Tim Hortons I've been to."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to my place of employment, so I come here most days.  They're a great bunch of women, lead by a competent and professional manager, who's name I unfortunately didn't catch.  Whenever I'm there, she's involved and quick to get your order prepared, sans problems.  Although the line-up in drive-thru is usually long, the manager (who has no problems jumping on the headset and taking the orders), is quick to clear the line.   I really wish I'd caught her name because I'd love to give her the kudos she so deserves.  So, to the nameless lady-manager-wonderwoman, you have succeeded in making my lunches spectacular :)  P.S.  you should carry my soup more often!! (Hearty Potato Bacon..yummy)"}
{"text":"I've been back to this location a few times after boycotting it for almost a year. Not much has changed, its still a busy location with mediocre staff. But, this location gets my food order correct almost all of the time, so that's a plus in their favor.   But a negative for them is the super rude woman who makes the breakfast sandwiches/bagels/etc. She's always fed up, behaves as if customers are stupid because they don't hear her call out their order the first time, and generally unpleasant. This morning, I got my tea and went to the end to wait for my sandwich and as she's handing me my sandwich, she's calling across the restaurant to another staff worker about how no one listens, no one listens...  You want to chat at work, have at it. But that's just plain rude to be doing that while you're supposed to be interacting with a customer and to yell it across the restaurant... this woman has some major attitude and its one of the reasons I'm probably going to boycott this restaurant again. It's fine for a Timmies, good selection on food and decent service but a lot of the staff are jaded and rude and I can't be bothered."}
{"text":"It's a great Tim hortons! It's pretty big and clean with a modern look and the workers there are always smiling and friendly and they seem to know a lot of the regulars there and strike up conversation.  The service has always been fast and there's a lottt of tables to sit at, I've never really had a problem finding a table. There's little shops all around for you to browse while you finish your coffee. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Consistently awful product. It is so convenient for us, but every time we go my coffee is not made properly (double double sans sugar). When you order a spicy crispy chicken wrap, and one regular crispy chicken wrap, they sprinkle their spicy shaker on one without identifying which one is spicy.  Every other Tims will toss their crispy chicken in their buffalo sauce, this one tosses it in the rub and away you go.  Today I ordered a spicy chicken wrap and they gave me a sandwich that was completely different from what I ordered. I love Tims, but we will avoid this location and drive out of our way to go to one that makes things correctly.  I get that people make mistakes but I think their recipes are off. Or maybe not following the Tim Hortons standard recipes.  Very inconsistent product from all other locations.   I do really enjoy the friendly little Caucasian lady at the till when she is there though!"}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Chicken Sandwich and a glazed chocolate donut. Tastes great. Good service. 5 star for that type of food service establishment."}
{"text":"Horrible. They never get the order right. I often go to other Timmis.  But once in awhile I make the mistake about every other month and go back  there again. The for sure thing is I always regret it."}
{"text":"Again I'm saying this: yelp needs negative stars, or black holes. At the very least zero stars.   Timmie's at YUL domestic arrival is shit.  Just don't bother. Okay, so how great is tim's coffee anyway? Past that.   I arrive on a early bird flight. I want sugar; I order a small french and a chocolate chip cookie. Great breakfast IDEA. In practice?   Shit.  French was just hot water and milk. Cookie was stale. I went back to return it; I was so annoyed. Who return's fast food anyway? Is that even done?  Wasn't accepted.   Shit stars."}
{"text":"I love this spot, very busy, lots of people, great for people, very pretty ceilings,lol   But they are famous for squishin my bagels.  Please stop the squishing. Respect the bagel, love the bagel."}
{"text":"I'm here almost everyday. Never any problems and the staff remember my order and start making it while I'm in line! The location does not have the full Tims menu as it is a smaller location that is attached to Pape Subway station. They also have a pick up window on the station side so you don't have to go out and pay again to get back in if you're in transit."}
{"text":"The staff at this location are awesome!! Service never disappoints!  Iced coffee is my usual norm....perfectly made every time! Clean inside and out. Patio in front."}
{"text":"When in Canada, I HAVE to get my Timmy fix!  Three of the four mornings during our last visit to the GTA, I made my way to Timmy's and was not disappointed.  As much as I love donuts, I decided to expand my horizons and order something different during each visit.  First it was Tim Bits, then donuts, lastly a bagel.  I was satisfied all three times!  Hands down, I love the Honey Crullers whether in donut form or Tim Bits.    The location is a bit tucked away and parking can be a small challenge but no big deal.  The staff was friendly but man, I've learned that you can't mess with a Canadian when it comes to their coffee order.   And I thought Americans were pretty fierce!    Oh, triple venti, 180F, soy, half caf, half decaf, Latte with two and a half Splendas, shot of vanilla, dash of cinnamon at Starbucks sounds pretty wimpy compared to a regular coffee at TH's!  Timmy, please cross the border and into California!"}
{"text":"The staff are friendly. As for this location there are way to many teens hanging in the parking lot with their supped up cars blasting music. These little punks litter all over the parking lot making this location look disgusting. To bad because the location is very convenient for a lot of people in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"this is always crowded and can't hangout for few minutes inside and chairs always occupied by poeple . Hope there was better space to sit and coffe they make is excellent"}
{"text":"Lots of people in the drive thru, moved quickly and they got my large order exactly right.  Great job!"}
{"text":"This Tim Horton's kinda sucks. They don't have a good selection of donuts or cookies, and they stop serving sandwiches...whenever they feel like it. I've been there at 11pm and they said they didn't serve sandwiches anymore, then another time I was there around 10pm and suddenly that was the magical \"no sandwich for you\" time, so I just stopped going here altogether. There's another Tim's around the corner on Dundas that will make me a sandwich whenever I order one, so I'll just stick to it from now on."}
{"text":"This is the worst Tim Horton's I've ever had the displeasure of giving my money to. I used to work around the corner, so we'd frequent this Tim's 2-3 times a day. I would get one coffee a day, and 3/5 times it would be wrong. How you can eff up a coffee that many times is beyond me. It wasn't only the coffee that they'd get wrong....I had an egg salad sandwich that was chock full of pepper, cafe mochas that were only half filled, wrong soup, etc etc. Listing them all makes me feel like I'm being petty, because hey...is a little error like that really going to impede my life? But then I think....YES. Why should I not expect stellar service? I complained one time but all I got was a phone call apologizing for the poor service and them telling me they'll work on it. They didn't. I at least wanted a gift card! LOL. The turnaround at this location is insane, they should install a revolving door. They used to have an employee that had multiple infected piercings....like I want to think about THAT when I'm eating my cookie. All in all, I would skip this Tims and go to pretty much ANY other one."}
{"text":"Drive through and conveniently located for myself. Usually I use the drive through and the line moves very quickly.   Craving Timmies coffee? Nearby and in this area? Just come here!   Reason for 3 stars: sometimes they forget condiments or specific requests and the people never look friendly when they give me my order.   -CL"}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons is hit and miss because they don't consistently carry the same variety of goods each week.  One day I'll show up to snag some Sour Cream Glazed Timbits and they'll be there, ready for me, and the next time they won't be in the case at all.  Also, if they run out of goods, they aren't always quickly replaced.  My most recent example is the Smile Cookies, which I wanted to purchase but they were sold out and it was going to take forever before they had another batch.    I only go to this Tim's out of desperation or lethargy, as I know of another location just a few minutes down the road that will have what I want. Otherwise, the service has always been fine, often delivered by meek kids in their late teens or early twenties."}
{"text":"We now realize why Tim Horton's didn't make it in NYC. This place is very minimal and a little disappointing as the first sign of a \"Canadian\" restaurant at the Pearson Airport. If you like your coffee black, bitter, and watery this is the place for you - they didn't have milk at the time. I wanted to like Tim Horton's because the Canadian company I'm with raves about it. Most of the other locations of this restaurant will top this place. For those who are adventurers and wish to drive back from Toronto to New York (ex. during a snowstorm that cancels all flights), there's a great Tim Horton's near the border crossing. Go there instead and avoid Tim Horton's airport quickie."}
{"text":"Lately, I've been weaning myself off Tim's as I'm finding the coffee to be more and more bitter.  I think that they've finally gotten too big and now they only put out mediocre food and coffee.  This is my 'last-resort' coffee spot and don't recommend."}
{"text":"Often full of people, not a very clean location. I would not use these washrooms, they are usually nasty. The staff is always cranky too. The parking lot for here is usually fulling making you park further down near the other stores in the plaza."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons usually has hit or miss service... always a HIT at this store! The staff that have been around for years greet me by name and remember my regular order. Management is super friendly here. At other Timmies locations, sometimes I have to ask they remake my steeped tea or coffee if it tastes burnt. I've never experienced that here. I always leave happier than when I enter. 5/5"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Love this location as it's fast and clean. Great staff and service is perfect! Drive thru is literally drive thru! No waiting at all!"}
{"text":"I came here about a month a go to buy a lemonade smoothie but there was a sign on the door stating there were no smoothies available. I went back today and the same sign was there. When I spoke to the cashier, she said they had placed an order and we're waiting for the delivery. Every other Timmies has been serving smoothies for weeks, why is this location having problems? I think it's mismanagement."}
{"text":"If we are friends on Yelp or if you are a wonderful follower, you will know that I check in at Starbucks often. Nope, I'm not a coffee addict. I tend to order various iced teas and food, and prefer Starbucks. On the whole, the folks there seem to know what they are doing, unless they are brand new. That's understandable. If I do order coffee, it has to be heavily flavoured, to mask the coffee aftertaste.  I go to Timmy's a handful of times a year. I tend to get food, soup, or steeped tea.  Recently, I got word that the TimmyMe app has been discontinued. There was a procedure outlined in an e-mail on how to transfer your balance from your account on TimmyMe to the new Tim Hortons app. I do not go to Timmy's enough to figure out what my password is. Even after resetting it, the procedure failed bigtime.  The easier way is to simply log on to the new app and add your Tim Card number there. Done! I figured out that I had $7.14.  With my newfound balance that felt like I had won a scratch-and-win lottery ticket, I decided to use it. I visited this Timmy's, which is on my route from work. I have probably frequented this location more than any other in the GTA.  The last time I was here was August 23, 2015. Facebook has a fun way of reminding me of my memories. My post that went with my pumpkin spice muffin pic then was as follows:  I haven't been to a Timmy's in a while. I decided to break my streak.  Me: Can I have a pumpkin spice muffin, please? Woman: We don't have that. Me: Seriously? I'm staring at it.  Her sidekick comes over and tells the woman that they do sell these muffins.  Perhaps I should start my streak again.  Today, I restarted my streak. Instead of walking into the store, I went through the drive-thru. The parking lot isn't exactly roomy, so you need to take care pulling into the drive-thru. I ordered an apple fritter.  \"No drink?\" the woman asked me over the speaker. \"Nope, I'm good.\" I replied.  I pulled up to the window and used my app. She pulled out the debit-credit device. After about five seconds, she realized that she needed her scanner.  The good news is that her scanner worked and I got my apple fritter. She gave it to me and that was it. I guess that friendliness is lacking today.  The apple fritter was okay for $1.25. I could barely find any apple bits. It was essentially sugary dough.  In short, I go to Starbucks because I typically have friendlier folks. There seems to be something odd that happens when I come to this location. Today's experience was much better, but the pumpkin spice muffin incident is still fresh in my mind.  P.S. The apple fritters at Starbucks may be way more expensive than what you'd pay at Timmy's. However, they are yummier and larger at the former.  (206)"}
{"text":"I just took a cup of coffee at one of this location in Toronto, so I'll only talk about their coffee. Bland, 99.99% tap water and 0.01% coffee flavored something. Ewww...."}
{"text":"This is a good sized Timmie's that sees a lot of traffic. It's slightly messy because of that. But otherwise they have everything here: coffee, donuts, sandwiches, muffins, etc. Service is pretty run of the mill for a Timmie's."}
{"text":"Straight outta Brampton,  Crazy motha fucka named Ny-Tron, From a gang called Niggaz With Appetite.  I was damn hungry, and my friend Mackenzie said let's go to Tim Horton's. I ain't never heard of no Tim Horton's till Mac tell me about it, and I try it. Man, I got loaded up on some tasty stuff, and they got the best damn coffee I ever had. Also, the service was first rate, and the place was so clean that crazy drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket would eat off the floor. I found out we have some of these Horton's in the states, so I'm gonna be sure to keep a lookout, because if they anything like this one, strait outta Brampton, I'm gonna get me some tasty vittles there too! Make it a habit. Who's Tim Horton, and do he hear a Who?"}
{"text":"This small Tim Hortons counter shares the space with the gas station across Hotel 10.  Perfect location for me to walk across the street each morning and bring back coffee and donuts to fuel up on for the day's vacation fun.  Tasty iced and hot coffee, and of course pretty good donuts. Some other pastry items like muffins, cookies, and a few other things to munch on.  Fast and friendly service too. The station and some characters around it can seem kind of sketch but harmless enough. No tables to sit at anyway so it's just a grab and go joint."}
{"text":"This is the closest Tim Horton near my house and I have been going there for the past 5 years. The food is the usual fast food but I always go since it's close and the service were good.  However, it all changed when they changed the manager from the older male manager to a new small female asian manager. The old manager is very patient and very chatty and friendly but this new manager is very impatient and rude to customers.   I was there to order the new grilled bagel and she at first mistaken that I wanted a bagel. When I cleared it up so that she has to make a modification on the order, everyone can hear her muttering \"oh god...\". Then I specifically asked for a combo and when she gave me the food, there is no hush brown. When I ask her about it, she just said annoyingly that she did not charge me and walked away.  As a client, I can accept mistakes in the order as long as everything is clarified, either make the order right and charge me for the difference or apologize and let me know there isn't much she can do about it. However, her behavior is not setting a good example to the other employees and I sincerely hope that they change the manager for this store."}
{"text":"I don't know how to describe this place... ah... limbo. It's in between good and bad. The patrons range from the homeless to Bay street trader. Mostly live in the neighbourhood. Occasionally, some noise-resilient students come to hoard chairs...er... to review for exams.   Line up in the morning is usually long but the servers are fast. My order came so fast that I thought I was in Chinatown. It takes less than a minute to get and serve you your coffee. It's the penny counting by customers that hold up the process. The place is small and not ideal for group meetings and this is too busy, and noisy, to have a sit down conversation. The coffee is well... taste like Tim Hortons.   BUT they are efficient. Very efficient. If you drink coffee like water, this is your place. Coffee lovers, stay away. Coffee drinkers, come!"}
{"text":"A busy pitstop for both english and French speakers alike. Even with a bathroom lineup (which went speedy), customer service and coffee/chocolate croissant were impeccable. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The Tim Horton's/Wendy's combo was really needed in our Weston neighbourhood, we really don't have enough places to eat around here.  Just one problem: the staff at both restaurants frequently make mistakes in the orders. Always check what hot coffee/tea and iced coffee orders you've been given and whether they remembered to omit sugar or syrup if you asked them to.  Same goes for the burgers on the Wendy's side, make sure they gave you the toppings you asked for. Always verify BEFORE you leave the counter!"}
{"text":"Happy to see a Tim Horton's when I we looking for something fast and cheap. The line-up was not too long and I had great customer service at the till. Just like any other airport Tim Horton's, your Canadian staple.   If you are heading down the next wing for your flight, I would recommend grabbing some good here as it is your last true good stop area. I had to come back as I was starving.  Safe flight!"}
{"text":"So I have given this place plenty of time to settle in and get their shizz together before updating my review, but it still STILL is the worst Tim Hortons I know of. Today I said three times Earl Grey tea and she still went and made me a green tea. Oh, and they let someone totally and visibly cut the line and they said nothing and served him first while the rest of us waited and waited. Seriously step up your game!!!"}
{"text":"While I'm not the biggest fan of Tim Horton's I don't mind it from time to time.  This particular location is popular with the McGill crowd and is open twenty four hours however it is below par compared to others.  Given that it's a hot spot for students it gets very hectic.  I wouldn't mind this so much if they would handle the crowds better.  If you go at peak times it's chaotic at best.  They are slow to get orders out and it gets very confusing."}
{"text":"Normally I refrain from reviewing chains since food and service tends to be constant at different locations as a result of corporate guidelines.  However there is the occasional franchise that doesn't live up to expectations or perhaps actually exceeds expectations.  When this happens I'll review them.  This branch of Tim Horton's is a 24 hour location and being right next to McGill attracts a lot of students looking for cheap coffee and food to fuel their studying.  The main problem with this franchise is the customer service.  Rush periods are quite chaotic and disorganized as the layout of the restaurant is kind of awkward and there is not a lot of space around the cash areas so when the crowds start growing space is at a premium.  They also can be very slow at processing orders so you can often expect a wait.  It also isn't out of the ordinary when a customer who arrives after you gets your food before you as what happened with me today.  The quality of the food is what you would expect from any Tim Horton's in Canada with the odd exception here and there.  My grilled cheese sandwich today was undercooked and consequently the cheese was only half melted.  It could have done with a little extra time on the grill."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons is tiny, has too little seating, and always has long lines at all hours of the day. Bad coffee for so-so prices."}
{"text":"What's happened to quality?  Bacon was raw and tasted of vinyl. No fresh bagels or hash browns.  Everything stale. Coffee good at least that hasn't changed.  This place has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"Filthy and featuring a rogues' gallery of creepy dudes, this is probably the worst Tim Hortons on the planet. Random garbage abounds and a selection of decrepit old-timers sit there all day staring out the windows. One wonders what they are even looking at as the windows have been too filthy to see out of since 2014.   I've been coming here for ten years and for the first little while, the place was just fine. Since the ownership of the building changed hands from Best Western to Parkside, there has been a noticeable drop in cleanliness, service, and overall standards.   Gave it another chance today for the first time in months. Instantly regretted it when I saw the buildup of trash in front of the register. Everything was sticky and I honestly didn't even want to touch the door handle. Tim himself is rolling in his grave."}
{"text":"Terrible quality food and coffee.  The service is fast but option confusing.  The only reason to go if to avoid being broke by expensive coffee around the McGill area.  Also, beware of bags going missing."}
{"text":"Timmies at the Airport, perfect!  And, the prices are not jacked up, extra bonus points!  The line can be long but it always moves at a nice speed.  They make the food and coffee pretty good, just like at a regular location AND they have a cooler with grab and go drinks and sandwiches if you are in a hurry.  I always stop by here before heading to the gate!"}
{"text":"Used to be good a few years ago. Then they renovated and got a new crew there. The foods been completely crap ever since. Burnt or cold and usually late. The coffee is still coffee but for a place without a drive thru window... Don't bother unless you're getting gas"}
{"text":"I find the time hortons franchise pretty consistent overall in their highs and lows. The prices are competitive in comparison to your local Starbucks and I don't mind the menu. I like that they always come out with new items to try. This month it was the maple panini breakfast sandwich. I went to Tim hortons today to order it for breakfast and I was disappointed. It seemed as if the bread comes with grilled mark but its nit toasted. My bread was soft and dry. I asked the woman at the register if it was toasted and if they could add butter and they handed it back to with butter on it. It definitely has a subtle maple taste not as overt as a mcgriddle sandwich but I don't like it. I'm still trying to figure out if its whole wheat because it has this grainy texture.   Aside from that I love Timmy's peppermint tea. I drink loose leaf tea and I still love Timmy's peppermint the best. Just remind them when ordering multiple times or they may sometimes give you green tea. Also remind them if you want your bread toasted and/or with butter because they will give you dry bread (happened on multiple occasions). But it's a cheap breakfast/snack shop and a Canadian staple in our diet"}
{"text":"The staff is so kind! I go there regularly and one day the employee there said I looked stressed (didn't sleep properly) and told me my tea was free for that day! Truly made my entire day."}
{"text":"I've never actually stepped into this location but I frequent the drive-through as it is across the street from my photo-lab, a short detour from the Stockyards area, and also a convenient stop if my travels require me to take the 400.  True story; three adults in the car and we each order a beverage, a donut or cookie and some sort of assembly-required sandwich.  The ENTIRE order was ready and waiting for us by the time we got to the window.  Wow.  Make sure to line-up for the drive-thru from the Weston Rd entrance and don't be a jerk and bud in from the side-road entrance/exit."}
{"text":"Efficient!  The end of the line is often just inside the doors but that line moves quickly. This location usually has two people per till during the busy hours and you'll barely have your change back in your wallet before they shout \"next!\".  -1 for the long narrow layout that the long line has to bisect."}
{"text":"So this has to be the worst Timmies location I've ever been too. The staff is rude.   On three different occasions I showed up at 11:40 am. Waited in line (either inside or drive through) and got to order at 12:01 and was told I was too late to get breakfast.  The supervisor doesn't care. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"This place opens 24 hrs. If your craving for ice cap at night and your in the area, this is the place to go.   There was only one staff at time when I was there. Quite a lineup when there's taxi drivers wanting coffee at this time. I noticed that there's no more timbits - that was a bummer!  It's not their fault. The bakers comes in around 4 am to make the entire day's work.   Was quite happy with my ice cap. Wish there's more timbits."}
{"text":"It's a Tim Horton. Nothing special in and of itself except for having the friendliest Drive-thru attendant. Nahid always has a smile on her face and greets everyone with it. She makes my family's day better every time we see her!  I hope management recognizes this great asset. Thank you Nahid."}
{"text":"ok i love this timmies drive thru and great location always get my bagels from here! of course you will experience mishaps from any fast food chains but common its tim hortons! we must love them all :) (unless they really actually do suck!)"}
{"text":"This Timmies is okay to pass by, has a number of goods and bads:  Goods: Great place to chill with friends, especially in the parking lot. Use to do that all the time while in undergrad. Speaking of undergrad, it is close to UTSC, so you have a possibility to find a number of students studying there. There are a few other stores around like subway, beer store, convenience, dollarama, etc should you need anything else. The food is standard Timmies. Parking lot is huge, so if you need a pit stop, its a good place to stop as you will always find parking. No outdoor seating, but there is a curb and everyone sits an relaxes in the summer.  Bads: As I used to hang here, you do see some really sketchy people. Sometimes people who are begging for cash, religious zealots, or just simply mental issues. They are never violent, which is a good thing. There have been fights there, but usually between younger people.   Recommend stopping in if you need too. Nothing special, but be aware of the cray cray."}
{"text":"This is a good Timmy's.  Always had good service, good selection.  I don't like the configuration of the drive-thru which cuts across the parking lot intersection.  Oft times dumb drivers tend not to keep clear of the intersection, and makes getting around the parking lot a pain."}
{"text":"When you arrive really late at the Sheraton and there's nothing around and you're starving, this is a good Timmys to hit up. Service has been disorganized when it's busy though."}
{"text":"I find this location to be very slow and the lineup seem like its always very long and slow moving. The food is regular Tim Horton s food so no complaints there."}
{"text":"Just like any other Timmies. Gotta say the parking lot and drive thru can get quite hectic at times. The coffee seems pretty fresh majority of the time."}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for a few hours now, waiting to pick up my mom from North York general hospital.  I ordered a large French vanilla. Same old, same old. One thing I noticed is that timmy 's doesn't like filling their drinks to the top, huh? Whether at this location or other locations. There's always about an inch of empty space from the top of my cup that could have been more of my drank.  Anyway this location seems to be pretty busy. The wait for my drink was a bit long for no particular reason as I beat the rush. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"I just landed at Pearson wanted to grab a quick sandwich at Tim's stood at the front of the line for 20 minutes watching people wander around before I got served if you have to catch a flight don't stop here first. Slowest service I've ever had at  Tim Horton's"}
{"text":"I have been a client since they opened. The location is nice, clean, luxurious.  The only negative side is the service. At first it's understandable. New location, new staff. Fine. But it has not improved. I find myself waiting 10-15 mins every time for a simple bagel. I hope it improves."}
{"text":"This Tim's is conveniently located for those working or going to school at OISE. Other than location, there's not much good to say. The lineups are always huge here, with little effort from staff/management to move things along. The last time I was here, my ice cap was not properly mixed, and spilling out the top. My donut was mostly melted after just 1 minute in the bag. Probably won't be back - this isn't the Tim Horton's I know and love."}
{"text":"I visit this location due to my new job, busy during morning rushes, as expected.  Friendly service with a smile, fresh coffee (on my dark roast black), display full of selections of food.  Place were clean even during morning rush."}
{"text":"Need a reward for surviving your full body pat down at security? Grab a hot cup of coffee through their Express line. (No more waiting!)  Plus, they know how to make a proper cruller... and the Canadian Maple donut is nice, too. Think Boston Cream, but with a maple topping instead of chocolate. Their maple is sugary awesomeness -- so much so that you can skip any sugar you usually put into your coffee."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this tim's a zero. Poor attitude and customer service. Purchased two chicken noodle soups to go, one was thrown into the bag on top of the other and had busted the lid open on the other one. I got home to a nice puddle in the bag. Needless to say, I was pissed."}
{"text":"Slowest. Service. Ever. Close to home, but id rather drive another 10min and ill get home and enjoy my coffee while i would be waiting still if i chose this place.. Maybe the drive thru is better..."}
{"text":"14 people working and they still can't get it right. They are so disorganized they give your food to other people. Lineups of up to 25min. Inconsistent and poorly managed. Second worst Tim Hortons ever."}
{"text":"I was craving a BBQ chicken wrap one day but was notified that they don't serve them anymore. I was so very sad, but I got a clam chowder soup which was ok."}
{"text":"C'est mon Tim Hortons préféré. Il a ouvert au printemps 2015. Avec mon travail au centre-ville et mes horaires qui sont inhabituels, que ce soit très tôt le matin ou le soir, je sais que c'est ouvert 24h, j'attends jamais en ligne et j'adore la grosse table en bois qu'ils ont mis. Que ce soit, le café, les bagels, les beignes/timbits, le yogourt ou encore un timatin, ils ont tous, le fast-food par excellence du canadien typique, lol ! Bref, vous voyez, ça dépanne bien une fois de temps en temps lorsque les cafés 3ème vague dorment encore... j'ai pas le choix de venir ici pour une dose de caféine. Le seul truc, que j'aime pas, c'est toujours les quelques itinérants l'hiver qui dorment vers la TV dans le fond du café et laissent une légère odeur de sale dans l'air :( Wifi gratuit.  3,5/ client depuis juin 2015"}
{"text":"This is a tucked away location on the southeast corner of Leslie and 16th Ave. The interior is gloomy and certainly has not been renovated on quite some time. There were no outlets from what I saw but there is plenty of seating. If I come here it's in the late afternoon/early evening; no issues with service so far."}
{"text":"No outlets, and not a 24-hour location (opens from 5:30am-10:00pm daily). It can get busy during the day during meal times and there isn't that much seating here. It's okay as a takeout place but not the best to sit in. High tops and round tables are featured in this particular location. There are two cash registers at the front and room for one line (though that doesn't stop people from forming their own). The high top tables are along the south side of the store facing the window, it's cut in this wavy pattern so the shape is irregular."}
{"text":"Rude customer service but the food is good! Beware, it is very dirty because it's located in a gas station. DO NOT USE THE BATHROOMS UNLESS YOU WANT TO CONTRACT HIV!!!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that this was my first time at a Tim Horton's and had heard good things.  We went for breakfast before our train back to the States.  I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel.  The bagel did not taste fresh and the eggs could barely be found.  My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin.  This thing was TINY and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big.  Somehow they ran out of hash browns but didn't realize it until after we paid.  They offered us a doughnut instead but we didn't want that. The coffee was so hot that you couldn't hold the cup more than 10 seconds.  Because that we had to throw it out.  We were  already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up as a loss."}
{"text":"Where can you find the only Tim Horton's that doesn't screw up your order?  The drive-through/take-out one on MacLeod Trail.  I've been here a few times already and they have never screwed up my order.  Sure, the doughnuts are made from frozen, sure the coffee is questionable, sure they hire people that lack common sense; but, they sell legal stimulants and that's OK."}
{"text":"Tim Horton's is the epitome of what happens when things get too big, too fast. With the increase in quick food at low prices comes declining service at all the Tim Horton's locations I visit these days.  The 49th Ave NE location is no exception.  At the drive-through speaker is a large and bold sign advertising peanut butter filled cookes so I ask them for one.  To my surprise, they are not available at this time.  I asked, \"did you run out?\" to which they reply, \"no we just don't offer them.\"...... Umm... being a stickler for setting things in order and offering up suggestions for improvement (the DNA of most Yelpers) I was quick to point out, very politely I may add, that there was a very large sign above the speakers advertising these yummy looking cookies.  The answer I got was an irritated, \"corporate told us to keep the signs up.\".... My response should have been, \"Stupid is as stupid does.\" but I know that bit of comedy would have been lost to this person.  So I accepted the idiotic policy and moved on.  Later, when I go to pick up my order, face to face I explain to him in very polite manner that I was just trying to prove a point that people *WILL* get confused.  He insisted that everyone knew the cookies weren't available.  Then I reminded him that I had not known and that if he would like to avoid any further unpleasantness from customers that perhaps they should temporarily remove the sign.  He didn't like that and got more irritated.  It was a hopeless cause, one that I had no further desire to address.  Alas, I got my sugar and legal stimulant fix and moved on.  From now on I am going somewhere that hires people who can converse with me; I would gladly pay a few extra dollars for that."}
{"text":"I am #NEVER entering this #badservice @TimHortons #Calgary location ever again.  This location had gone SEVERELY downhill the past year.  Grab a coffee and sit down for a few minutes while I tell you this long story.....  The last few times my breakfast orders have been wrong.  The has browns have been given to me all smashed up and falling apart.  The straw that broke the camel's back was how they treated me the last time I was there.  I had to park on the street and pay for parking because the parking lot was full (as it usually is).  I thought 10mins would be enough time to pay the meter.  After all, how long does it take to get 3 dozen doughnuts right?  Well, I was in there for over 25 minutes, not due to a line but due to a very SLOW employee.  I wanted to get 3 dozen doughnuts for a meeting I was attending.  As I was walking in I saw a poster advertising party trays, it read \"ask us about our....\" .... so I went inside and asked the employee about the party tray.  I said \"I'd like to know more about the party trays.\"   He responded, \"we don't offer party trays\".  Then I proceeded to explain that I saw a poster outside that said to ask you about the party trays.  He then said, \"oh those are for breakfast\".  I said, \"well then, can I order 3 dozen doughnuts and have them put on some sort of party tray platter?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because thy won't fit doughnuts.\" \"How many doughnuts do they fit?\" \"No many.\" \"Can you put a few doughnuts in there and put the rest in boxes?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"We ran out of the trays.\" He then walked away and came back. \"Actually we have some trays.  I can put some doughnuts in the tray for you.\" \"How many doughnuts can you put in a tray.\" \"Seven or eight, not sure.\" \"Ok, I'll have two dozen doughnuts in boxes and twelve doughnuts in two trays\"  Then I asked him if was going to charge me for 3 dozen doughnuts and he said he was going to charge me for 2 dozen and then 2 half-dozen doughnuts.  At this point I was getting frustrated.  \"Just give me 3 dozen doughnuts in boxes\"  He took my payment and walked away before I could ask him for a receipt.  I waited for a good 5 minutes before I saw him again. When I saw him he was squatting down to pick up the doughnuts in the display case and started putting them into none other than PARTY TRAYS (remember: we discussed boxes now).  I assumed he found bigger trays to put the doughnuts in so I though nothing of it and waited a few more minutes.  About 15 minutes after walking into the store I was getting more irritated as I had not heard from the employee yet.  I knew it was taking 15 minutes because I kept tabs on how long I had from when I parked my car.  I tried to get the employee's attention but he was never adamant about looking my way to see if I was OK.  I asked him finally, \"what's going on?  Why is it taking so long?\"  \"You wanted me to put them into trays so that's what I'm doing.\" \"No, we discussed that idea was going to be scrapped and we decided boxes.\" \"You said trays.\" \"Yes, but then we decided against it.  And why is it taking so long?\" \"They aren't fitting.  They aren't designed for doughnuts.\" \"Can you just leave whatever you have in the tray and put the rest into boxes?\" \"But that's not what you wanted.\" \"Well that's what I want now.  I've been here too long so hurry up.\"  I walked back to where I was waiting, by this time a line was forming because he was busy wasting time reducing the number of employees helping customers.  Another few minutes went by and I got irate because I was worried that I was going to get a parking ticket.  I went back to the employee, \"Now what's taking so long?\"  \"They still aren't fitting.\" \"Just put them all in boxes.\"  At this point I went to the manager and told him what was going on.  He apologized and sped up the process and got me out of there shortly after.  The attitude of the employee coupled with the lack of basic intelligence and problem solving skills makes me never want to go back into that location again."}
{"text":"Parking tickets 45 beware. Management doesn't give a hoot. Went to Tim Hortons and got a 45 dollar ticket parking in the lot of the Tim Hortons. Called store and the HR manager told me I was screwed. So guys beware this Tim Hortons is completely mismanaged. They don't warn you about possible tickets in their parking lot. I can't be the first person to get one. Nor will I be the last. My suggestion is to go to Starbucks were I have never gotten a ticket before. To hell with Tim Hortons and the management team at this location."}
{"text":"Great location.  No WiFi  (hopefully for now).  Service is a little slow as  cash only.  Typical fare of your everyday tummies with the double double,  Tim bits or the frozen drinks that appeal to your taste."}
{"text":"Mes attentes sont super réalistes pour un Tim, on obtient ce pour quoi on paye. En ce sens, je ne peux pas dire que cette franchise est pire qu'une autre, puisque les viennoiseries et les beignes sont \"ok\" et que les tablettes sont bien garnies à toute heure du jour. L'ambiance par contre, c'est tout autre chose. Je suis agressée à chacune de mes visites par l'attitude terriblement inappropriée des employés. Il y a bien deux ou trois exceptions dans l'équipe du matin, des employés plus âges qui ne sont tristement pas souvent à la caisse. Les autres se crient des instructions, ils beuglent littéralement, zéro courtoisie. Si seulement ça les rendaient plus efficaces, hélas non, mon bagel préparé reste inévitablement sur le bout du comptoir, juste hors de ma portée, pendant que je cherche à capter l'attention de quelqu'un qui pourra s'étendre le bras et me le remettre. Il serait probablement plus rapide d'apprendre la formule magique \"Accio\" de l'univers d'Harry Potter pour le faire venir à moi. L'atmosphère est sans doute dictée par la patronne, une femme rapide au service au volant, certes, mais qui a un manque de considération pour ses employés qu'elle traite comme des idiots sans gêne devant nous. Je suis toujours perplexe de voir des clients rester dans la salle à manger pour consommer leur nourriture, peut-être apprécient-ils le spectacle?"}
{"text":"Stopped in after the Jays game for a bowl of soup as I can tell I was getting sick.  Haven't been in a Tim Hortons or ate Chicken Noodle Soup from Tim Hortons in a LONG time   This particular Tim Hortons is large and spacious but looked a bit 'grimy' and dirty.  Still it's staff were friendly and there was free wifi to enjoy the Presidential Debate lol.  The soup was different from last I remembered--bow tie pasta and a thinner soup.  Looks like either cream or flour was put in to thicken in"}
{"text":"Always busy, huge lineups 3 cash machines, only 1 person working them.  In previous visits even with all 3 cash registers manned still same problems, very poorly managed space."}
{"text":"Not really much to say about this place. It's a Tim Hortons at the airport. Your last chance to get your fix before leaving for your flight. Which is exactly what happened to my cousin and I. We had been meaning to stop by this chain all weekend, but couldn't seem to manage till the end.   There was a line, but the wait wasn't terribly long. I ordered a small coffee with cream and sugar with a Canadian Maple (because of course.) My cousin ordered a chocolate chip frappe and a set of doughnut hole samples.   The doughnuts were alright. The maple was fine, but some of the doughnut holes were stale. I enjoyed the coffee, and the frappe I tried was tasty.  Really glad we could go before we left for the states!"}
{"text":"I'm  sure the donuts and coffee a passable. The level of douchebaggery amongst the customer base is insane. This shop is connected to a gas station and the propensity of the Tim Hortons patrons for blocking up the gas pumps is truly amazing for fear that you might just maybe, possibly trying to get in front of them in the drive thru line up. Don't go here or try getting out of your car and going in the damn store for a change. Especially if your car is going to screw up the flow of traffic."}
{"text":"Lots of seating, friendly staff, lots of parking, you'll see \"the regulars\" in there at their scheduled time, farmers, locals, all frequent this shop, in addition to the sojourner.   Clean (at least it has been when I've been there).  If you want to go to a place where you feel like you're a friend amongst strangers, this usually fits the bill.  Drive-thru location"}
{"text":"I always frequent this Tim Hortons as I work nearby and it's great service, one of the newer employees, Patrick, stands out among the rest because of his excellent customer service and work ethic. He deserves a raise/promotion and I see him going far!"}
{"text":"Okay food, been through drive thru quite a lot, the wedges are always cold and hard, so don't recommend them in this specific location"}
{"text":"Been coming here almost as much as the other Tims in my area. They've always had superior coffee and speedy service, they're just a bit farther from us.  I'd say the service is decent now, but the coffee has stayed just as good. I've only had the wedges here, they're the same as everywhere else.  The place is always pretty clean, though it seems to attract some characters with very interesting a mildly concerning conversations to say the least. Other than that, it's a great timmies!"}
{"text":"I come here as it's the closest location to my work. I often get into the drive through, or sometimes go down and pickup if I have the time. While timing is critical for me getting to work, I would STILL rather driver another intersection or two to get my breakfast from another location. Unfortunately, as per one of the pictures I have posted, the quality at this location is very bad compared to the well-known Tim Hortons! Very fast service down the drive-through lane, however, that's probably justified by the bad quality and mossed presenta    I had promised myself not to come to this location no more! But I just had no choice this morning as I was late to work. I ordered a 12 grain bagel with Peanut butter, easy and simple right? Only to come here and find the Bagel by itself laying in a small bag without any peanut butter! How can you even mess this up!? Are you kidding me!? How terrible are you? From a scale of 100-1000!!! Now my breakfast is ruined because of you! OMG! This location is the WORST i've ever seen!"}
{"text":"Not a real Tim hortons- Small Tim hortons in a gas station. They have a very limited menu- no food and no iced coffee (only hot coffee and iced caps)."}
{"text":"I have to chime in and say WORST Tim Horton's in Calgary. Sadly it's the closest one to where I work that's open Sundays. It took me over 5 minutes one weekend to get a Bagel BELT and Steeped Tea.   I'll stick to going to the Timmy's in Somerset on my way to work me'thinks."}
{"text":"This is an interesting location. It's small and you can walk in, but there isn't really any parking and there isn't any seating. There are two drive-thru lanes but becareful which one you pick. The one on the right will spit you out onto northbound McLeod and the one on the left does a u-turn so you can go in any direction you need.  I've never hit this location during the morning rush, but during the day there is rarely ever another car in the drive-thru. The service is fast, but on par with most other locations in the city.  Also worth mentioning, because of the small size of this location, the menu is slightly limited. There are a few things missing like bagels."}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare in the mornings until mid-afternoon. Parking is a disaster in the winter as they probably lose 1/3 of the parking spaces due to people not being able to see the lines and just seem to haphazardly line-up their vehicles in something close to an organized fashion. The line inside is long and the staff aren't great."}
{"text":"Meh. The couple of times I've been here its been very slow service. Both times I've visited have been non-peak hours with only a couple of people in line."}
{"text":"The best part of this Timmy's is that no one seems to know about it except for the businesses in the area. This location is just off 52nd but its hidden behind the large Husky gas station so you can't see it from 52nd.  There's never a line in the drive-thru and always lots of parking."}
{"text":"This little Timmy's is tucked away in Cumberland Terrace. It's not very big but it's always busy and the line is usually out the door. Most of the people in line when I come through on the odd weekend are staff from Holt Renfrew.  The staff aren't the friendliest but they get you through as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"This is a lean running Tim Hortons. I've hit this location both in the morning and late at night and they never seem to have enough staff on. The place is always a mess with napkins and wrappers all over the floor and tables and chairs strewn about.  The staff though still seem to take it all in stride and never seem to be stressed out and provide good customer service."}
{"text":"The drive-thru here can be very hit and miss as to how busy its going to be. Sometimes there can be an outrageously long line and other times there's maybe one or two people in front of you.   They recently added a second menu board to the D/T which has helped shorten the line. The only problem I've seen since this modification is that some assholes don't like to alternate after ordering. I guess they REALLY need their double double."}
{"text":"This location is a little nicer than your average T-ho's. The decor really tries to fit into that Cabbagetown feel and I think it does it well. The service isn't always the fastest, but then again, the customers never seem to be in any sort of a rush either. Aside from those points, it's a Tim Horton's so you know what to expect."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gong show (on a Saturday afternoon).  The good: Lots of seating The bad: Lots of university student laptop hobos taking up entire tables sitting alone  The good: Four or five cashiers with runners The bad: They are really disorganized and don't seem to know who's job is who's.  The good: The line moves quickly. The bad: The customers standing in it seem like they've never been in a Tim Hortons before and don't know what's going on.  There was tons of confusion happening at this location. There were people loitering that looked like they were in line, but weren't. It took a couple of tries for the staff to get the drink order right for the guests ahead of me. Other staff seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off but no actual direction. The cashiers seemed to be trying to run food and make drinks while taking orders and confusing their runners.  Just not good.  November challenge 3/30"}
{"text":"Another Timmy's that's opened in a shopping centre without a drive-thru. Despite having to get out of your car, everything else is the same-old here. Good service standard quality of food. Sometimes parking can be a little dicey in this parking lot as everyone seems to be zooming around in a rush."}
{"text":"While it would have been great to see an independent cafe open up in this shopping centre at least something finally came.   This location doesn't have a drive-thru. I'm sure this is because the parking lot congestion it would bring of people blocking roads just to get their double-double. The good side of it is that there's lots of parking in the morning being attached to the Sobeys lot.  When I walked in yesterday I seemed to hit a lull. Lots of people sitting down but no line! The staff were friendly and seemed eager about their new jobs. While the lady helping me was off making my tea another gentleman came over to make sure I had been taken care of."}
{"text":"This was my go-to Timmy's when I worked near-by.  EXPECT A LINE!  This location is always packed during the week. The drive-thru will have no less than a half-dozen cars in it and the line inside will be to the door. However, they always have a ton of staff on and they work well as a team to get everyone their orders in an efficient amount of time."}
{"text":"On a slow Thanksgiving Monday evening I ventured in here. I hope that the staff weren't very quick because it was a slow evening because it took the cashier way to long to make my coffee, tea, and doughnut order."}
{"text":"I like this location because its always a fun hunt to find the end of the drive-thru. The lay of the land here isn't typical for a Timmy's location and there are parking stalls everywhere so it can be a challenge to get around.  Inside, the store is bigger than most and they're always ready for the big line that comes through every morning. Overall, great customer service and quick processing times."}
{"text":"When I walked in here this past Saturday, the girls behind the counter were shouting across the room to each other about something, what I don't know. When the most obnoxious girl finally decided to help me I ordered my usual steeped tea. While I waited she quickly filled another order before getting my drink going, which also happened to be a steeped tea. There was a half pot of tea brewed and not quite enough to fill both of the orders. She decided that the prudent thing to do would be to fill each cup with tea equally and then top them off with hot water.   I was shocked. I've never seen anything like this before. I gladly would have waited a few minutes for her to brew another pot. Instead she filled a third of the cup with water and sent me on my way. Judging my he casualness with the act it seems like she probably does this regularly. Now I'm not a Timmy's expert or anything but I'm pretty sure this would go against their product quality standards. I was already annoyed from the lack of customer service upon my arrival that I didn't bother to get her to try it again with my drink."}
{"text":"This location always seems a little short staffed but the staff they do have working try to make the best of it. I know this location is, or at least used to be, franchised so maybe the owners are trying to make things a little more profitable by thinning out the wages they pay out.  Other than the fact that it might take you longer to get through the line here the food and beverages are always up to the Tims standard.  Oh, and as others have mentioned, there is no drive-thru here."}
{"text":"It's a super-busy location and you have to hit it at the right time of day. That said, if you approach your coffee the way a veteran approaches methadone dosing, you have problems that Yelp can't solve.  A perfectly nice location with good people. It just gets a bit frenetic at times, is all. Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Right across from Cummer Park (*cough cough*... phrasing...), convenient in-and-out, friendly staff, good cheap coffee. It's everything Tim Horton's is supposed to be, and they run a tight ship. Good times."}
{"text":"Quality: Coffee is always bitter, burnt, and old.    This location always messes up my simple order. There is never consistency. Workers are always rude, trying to work fast but it always messes up the quality. Must avoid this location."}
{"text":"Quick breakfast run. Place was busy but to be expected at a near-campus location at 11 am.  Had a breakfast sandwich. It was ok but didn't taste all that \"always fresh\" to me.  Coffee was a bit weak too. Might be time to step my coffee game up and try new spots cause my home pots are getting stronger and timmies' is not.  Lots of seating and nice views of ago and varsity centre   I RECOMMEND- just cause they're served till noon doesn't mean they're good past 10. For breakfast sandwiches, early bird gets the warmth.   EXTRA TIP- Strong wifi connection. Yay."}
{"text":"My first and ever Tim Hortons' review!!   I have nothing against Tim Hortons...but I have not have one for more than 2 years! Why am I here this afternoon drinking a XL coffee with cream only and having a chocolate glazed donut? oh now I remember why... a nice yelp friend gave me his \"Roll Up the Rim to Win\"' prizes!!  Freaking line up... with 10 guys in front of me... all working in the factories and offices in the area...... They all having their coffee to go...   The to stay ones are seniors...no students parking themselves with their laptops or studying or doing their homework... Now definitely this is not my scene... I ended up having mine to go too... :)  Server was polite and friendly... and when he asked me what size for my FREE coffee!!  of course XL!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing open at 2 am and you really want to look for a clean and safe washrooms in the area... Tim Hortons is the place to be.  The crowds here are pretty mellow and quiet... maybe they just sound quiet to me after I came out from a music blazing place?  Ran out of Ice Cappuccino... but it is kind of cold out.. I don't know why my friend want to have one?   For me, a warm cup of coffee though weak compare to my usual preferences, but i is a life saver after a few drinks!"}
{"text":"I have never set foot inside this Tim Hortons but I have been using their drive thru services for years.  There is always a line but no worries the service here is just so efficient. My usual order of Sesame Bagel Toasted with Cream Cheese always ready by the time I drive up to the pick up window!  The parking lot though can be super busy as it is shared with a Wendy's and also a lot of commercial vehicles are here including dump trucks as it is close to Scarborough Drop Off depot just down the street.  This location also frequents by police cruisers so don't speed through the parking lot, you never know who would be there around the corner."}
{"text":"Having been to hundreds of Tim Hortons over the years, this one is near the bottom of the list. Completely incompetent staff, total confusion behind the counter, barely able to communicate in English. What's not to love ? A very poor representation of what some view as iconic Canadian culture."}
{"text":"At times there are more people behind the counter than in the store. So why is there rarely more than one person serving people lined up ? Besides one or two staff that actually smile this is a Tim's to avoid. The staff are usually in a state of confusion, not the best hygiene when placing lids on cups with snotty fingers, and mixing up of orders. $14 per hour, soon to to be $15 per hour pay. Please explain ?"}
{"text":"This is a Tim Hortons and Wendy's combo location with a drive through. Nothing much to add since it's a chain and the service and type /quality of food and drinks are predictable...."}
{"text":"This location is disastrous. The lines are confusing and it is hard to know which cashier is open. The wait is always long, even just for a coffee. The staff are nice and they are always in an ER mode. Either the location is severely understaffed, or there is something wrong with the work flow. Tim Horton's really needs to learn from MacDonald about modernization."}
{"text":"Welcome sight at the airport here in Montreal ....for once a place that doesn't gouge their customers at an airport .. even Subway doubles their prices here .., shame shame .. probably why Tom Hortons continues to succeed and keeps its loyal customers as well as adding new ones ... thumbs up to Tims!!!!!..selection was good and everything tasted great.. coffee of course was great as usual .. got to be the busiest place here ! lineups but service is fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Long lines but hey, its Tim Hortons right! The staff here is pretty slow compared to the usual downtown store but I realized that they do have to deal with a lot of language issues at the counter so I give them a few plus points for that!   My tea was good so I was happy! Or maybe I was happy because I was flying away from the cold to sunny Cuba....I don't know,."}
{"text":"Another good Tim Hortons, the ... second of three Tim Hortons on the way to Costco. I can hardly believe they are so bountiful, being depraved so long down here in the US. Three on the way to Costco... sigh.  This one is notable because the service was always fast, a bit faster than the one that was right by our house. Quality was up to par, can't complain."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons is located at the conference center (Palais de Congres), and provided my morning coffee for about a week. And sometimes mid afternoon or evening coffees as well. I was very fortunate to discover that Tim Hortons will actually put a \"half\" milk in the coffee (basically, half the amount of milk they regularly put in). Which is helpful when you're on a diet, but are barely in Canada and can't get over how delicious that coffee cream is in their crack-laced coffee."}
{"text":"Very clean and spacious.Staff is ok.Variety is not as extensive as it should be.Over all the service is good"}
{"text":"This TIm Hortons is located inside a gas station.  It is very busy on weekend mornings, special thanks to complete lack of competition in the vicinity.  I find the coffee and pastries at par with other Tims.  The breakfast muffin is unappetizing, but this is also at par with many Tims, unfortunately.  The place is usually clean when I visit in the morning.  Services is matter-of-fact."}
{"text":"A really small Tim Horton's, understandable given the area.   As a result, there aren't a lot of places to sit, it gets packed very quickly. Not a good thing in the winter when nobody wants to sit out on the patio.   There's a sizable late-night crowd, especially on weekends. And yet, this location refuses to staff more than two people after 10pm. Long lines with 10 minute waits are common, as one person works the cash, while another makes food/drink orders. Sometimes only one person does food/drink orders and cash. Unacceptable.   That being said, it's a good location and the staff members are very friendly."}
{"text":"Since that company took over Tim Hortons and they have done absolutely everything to cut costs you guys just get worse and worse. I can't even walk home with a coffee in my hand and a box of Timbits without the coffee spilling everywhere because the lid leaks from both the top and the bottom. Then you've got franchisees negatively impacting their employees because even though they make about $300,000 a year per store they can't provide their staff proper benefits. I'm done with Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"Due to an unforeseeable series of events, our Friday night ended in a cab home at 6AM Saturday morning.  The backseat decision-makers conferred and we all agreed: we were past the point of our usual late-night cravings (poutine, pizza, poutine with pizza)...it was time for breakfast foods.  With that solid strategic decision made, the cab driver rolled up in front of this Tim Hortons, which is open 24 hrs.     Inside the Timmy's a serene vibe reigned: there was a man eating a bagel, another asleep with head down on a table, and a third reading the paper.  We were able to immediately sashay (why not?) up to the front, where one lone employee manned the counter.    The dialogue was simple:    We asked, \"what's your freshest donut?\"  \"They are all fresh\", the dude-in-brown-uniform responded.  Whereas I might normally dock him a few points for being surly, I kinda appreciated the early morning grumble and the fact that he wasn't picking favourites.  So we ended up with muffins and a box of Timbits.  Efficient, inexpensive, inandout without racking up too much time on the taxi meter.    Yum dash oh.  The multi-pack of Timbits was perfect, with my favourite being the old fashioned and the sourcream glazed.    We ate them all by the time we got home.   We wished we had more.   We slept soundly.    Yelp note: it pays to buy Timbits in bulk PLUS that means that the employee will fashion a little cardboard carrying case for you.  What better way to make friends?!?"}
{"text":"tim hortons coffee is terrible! those timbots are sugary diabeetus traps. comsumeers beware, EVEN MY BESTIE HAO AGREES"}
{"text":"Wtf? Is it normal to not be able to order a large coffee in an extra large cup so that we could add some ice in it to cool it down? My husband starts to say he will pay for an extra large but wants a large in it. I say no, and I mention about people double cupping for free, she lets us have a small cup of ice.  What was the purpose of this? Is she/are they trying to save money? Because I feel that the option she gave us was actually costlier in the end.  Honestly I think there was something up her ass the entire time. Before we ordered, an old man nicely handed her the food tray and she tells him to put it in top of the garbage instead. And she kept eyeing him as he did it.  Tues. Nov. 3, 3:15pm."}
{"text":"1 star from me because the restroom is really dirty at the time i came. I came here got a tea, waiting to be picked up. Shift changed, I went to restroom again and no one cleaned it. 1 toilet even has some flyers or newspapers in there. Ugh!  The reason I put another star is because of the free wifi and it's 24/7...."}
{"text":"This Timmies is always packed....from dudes hanging out in the parking lot having essentially tailgate parties, to real estate agents putting in offers, to friends gathering over a coffee..this place is always hopping. Food is decent, chili one of the best out there (puts Wendy's to shame). Drive through is poorly planned, causes  traffic problems in the parking lot and even impedes getting into their own section of the lot. Biggest complaint is that they don't sell Toasted Coconut Timbits !"}
{"text":"A Timmies at the bottom of my street......how Canadian is that? I used to avoid this Timmies at all costs, as on numerous occasions my steeped tea was a coffee when I finally sipped it. Thankfully, they've turned themselves around. Staff is friendly (at drive thru and inside) and efficient. Line-ups can get quite long during the morning rush, and getting back onto Vellore Woods (to travel east on Rutherford) is downright nightmarish.  It's not a full service Tim's...meaning some items aren't available."}
{"text":"This Timmy's just underwent a wee lil makeover!   I actually don't mind this Timmy's.... two colleagues and I typically visit this Tim Horton's about 4 - 7 times a week, and have had very few mishaps with our tea.  And really, isn't that what we're looking for here?    The tea can taste different from time to time which I don't understand, but for the most part we are left satisfied with our 3 large teas for 5$. There are now TWO line ups at this Tim Horton's versus the ONE lineup pre-makeover.    Typically for Tim Horton's I just want them to be fast and accurate, and this one does an alright job.  There have been a couple of mornings where there's been a drunk dude passed out with cans around him sitting at a table - yeah you need to get that sh*t under control.  I said 1 sugar two milk not 1 crazy dude and two Mike's Hard Lemonade cans."}
{"text":"What's a Canadian visit without several stops at Tim Hortons?  Seriously I think there's a Tim Hortons for every 5 people in Canada!  This particular one is right next to the hotel I stayed in which meant I got my fix of Timmy right away.  The coffee is amazing and so are the menu items.  Ordering my cup of Joe was always interesting because of how I'm so babied here by Dunkin Donuts.  I just say make it light and sweet but at Tim Hortons they want to know how much sugar and milk you want!  I finally remembered to say one milk and one sugar by at least my third visit out of many.  You heard that right I frequented this place more than three times over the course of my trip.  Like I said the coffee is fresh and delish.  There's something different about it that doesn't give it that coffee aftertaste.  I always ordered the steak, egg, and cheddar sandwich on an English muffin that was grilled for breakfast.  I can honestly say that for a fast food chain the breakfast sandwich that I got was perfectly done, delicious, and (gasp) not greasy.  It didn't taste like it was loaded with salt either.  I could have eaten a  whole lot of it but I was afraid I'd have a heart attack and be forced to use Canada's universal healthcare!  Ugh just the thought of it scares me!  Anyways I also got to try their hash browns, cookies, and muffins and I was continually surprised how much better they tasted than their counterparts here in the states.  I don't know if I was suffering from Canadian fever but I'm sticking to my opinion.  Hopefully when I do return for a visit I'll still feel the same.  We shall see eh...  P.S. This place is primarily a drive through and the actual front store is very tight so be ready to wait in line outside if there are people ahead of you."}
{"text":"This location is well staffed  with really good service and fresh donuts.  Their wraps are really good , mainly the chicken bacon ranch. I usually come here if the  lines are short. Always try their featured donuts and new items. One opportunity to improve is to ensure that there are donuts ready for sale when the store opens. I once came at open and there were only muffins  and timbits available to purchase  from the edibles and not a single donut in sight ."}
{"text":"This location has decent service and fresh product. What disappoints  me is that during the times of 5 am to 7 m the cashier is left all alone to deal with a long lineup . The service goes downhill from there especially once you have customers ordering bagels and sandwiches which slows everything down to a standstill . Perhaps scheduling extra crew to handle those customers would be  great. I will not be back during that time frame unless I see a properly staffed cash station."}
{"text":"Being a Canadian living in the U.S., whenever I get a chance to return to the place where I grew up, anyone can get their Starbucks and Peet's coffee, so I always make a point to have my Tim Horton's coffee every chance I get.   Once upon a time, Duncan Donuts (and its coffee) restaurants were omnipresent, but now it has been replaced by Tim Horton's chain (a former NHL player). Second Cup is basically Canadian version of Starbucks, I'd go from time to time, but for me, Tim Horton feels more like home as the number of Van Houtte Café seems to have dwindled since I left for the U.S.   Tim Horton coffee make me like I'm home, and it has a very casual feel to it - which makes me feel really warm."}
{"text":"Watery coffee.  Yes, even for Tim Horton's.  Unpleasant service.  Glad I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cheap food. Suitable for vegetarians. Try the potato wedges and the garden salad. Also the bagels and croissants."}
{"text":"I visit this Tim Horton's on a regular basis because it is very close to my work and I am frequently sent on a \"Tim's run\".  The staff is very friendly and the quality of food is fine but they can't seem to get my order right.   I would say 1/3 of the time they mess something up on my order.  They've given me the wrong kind of tea, coffee instead of tea, the wrong kind of oatmeal, a couple ice caps made with cream when I asked for milk, the wrong kind of bagel and have even forgotten to give me cups when I've ordered a Take 10 Box of Coffee.  It's not like it's just one time that this has happened...it's a couple times a week.  If they get my order wrong that frequently then they must be getting other people's wrong fairly often as well."}
{"text":"The woman who took my order was very friendly and attentive even got me to get soup instead of fries! Had the #8 BLT sandwich with medium coffee and bowl of hot chicken soup. Very good for fast food. And it was fast! The dinning area was a bit dirty."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Cold Stone part of this Tim Hortons/Cold Stone store.  Went in here to pick up a birthday ice cream cake and was met with terrible customer service.  The cake was a 6-slice round small cake, but when I went to pay, the person was charging me for a large rectangle cake at $54.99.  When I said the price on the sign said it was \"$24.99\" the person told me that it was a large cake.  He was a Supervisor.  He was argumentative and was telling me it was marked incorrectly.  When I asked to see a manager, an assistant manger came out and she offered even worse customer service.  She then changed the price to $33.99, but when I showed her the sign that marked it at $24.99, she said she couldn't change it.  I mean, I was in there to get a birthday cake, not to have an argument or get overcharged.  It was a nightmare.  I'm all about customer service, and this location just lost my business.  If you like getting over charged and cheated, go here."}
{"text":"WHAT TO GET?!?  The S'mores donut and the small iced coffee!  Why? Because the S'mores donut is here for a limited time and it tastes delicious! And the small iced coffee is on promotion for 99 cents! What a deal!  The S'mores donut comes with not cream, but marshmallow filling!! Also, the topping includes milk chocolate crumble, graham cracker crumble and super mini marshmallows. Yipppee!!   LAST TIP?  Order two small iced coffees and it's still cheaper than getting a medium coffee in terms of the amount you get for $2!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! That's all I have to say.. my mom and I went here to grab a quick bite during our fun filled day running around doing what we do best on my day off.. The service was top notch!! I ordered a turkey club sandwich and I was second guessing if I was in a Tim Hortons when I got it. The sandwich was filled with loads of meat (more than the usual), the bread was super fresh and they put it together beautifully. Now I know you are probably thinking to yourself... what's the big deal it's only a Timmies.. but the truth of the matter I have never been treated so well in a Timmies before.   Next.. the place was packed (it wasn't even lunch time). There were no seats and line ups right out the door..I didn't have a chance to try their coffee but I'm sure it wouldn't taste burnt like most places I end up..  all in all a big THUMBS up for a job well done!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the grilled chicken caesar salad and it was huge.  Picture is worth a thousand words."}
{"text":"This location is terrible they always mess up my order I order soup no bun every time even though it's suppose to be included, I ordered turkey bacon club one time they put no bacon, I order breakfast they forget something, no time to run back for you guys to correct my order it's ok I'm staying away from Tim's because the quality has really gone down the drain not just this location but many others I'd rather McDonald's they rarely mess up my order"}
{"text":"P.S.A.: Whatever your feelings about Tim Hortons in general, you should avoid hanging around in this particular location, particularly if you have any valuable possessions with you. This place the site of (sometimes very sophisticated) backpack and laptop thefts on literally a daily basis. A friend had his backpack taken and replaced with a decoy backpack while he wasn't looking. My girlfriend once had her wallet stolen out of her knapsack here. A friend of hers had her laptop lifted from her knapsack while sitting with friends, not realizing it until she got up to leave. The place is obviously frequented by some clever thieves who know that McGill students with fancy laptops and iPhones are easy marks."}
{"text":"Not speedy but good and cheap. If you're ordering a sandwich, be patient. This restaurant shares its space with a Wendy's."}
{"text":"Small Tim Hortons counter in a gas station. Not much selection on the donuts. I went around 3pm and the donuts tasted old and stale. Coffee was old tasting as well. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons/Wendys location recently renovated.  From the outside, it looks updated and promising.  However, getting through the doors is now a challenge with the seating layout.  You cannot walk to the counters of either restaurant without having to navigate around the oddly placed chairs and tables, which now block the logical route from the doors.   I've seen this at other locations as well and I find it absolutely baffling.  Couple this with the coffee, which in recent years has slipped in quality, the disinterested staff, and the raised prices, and you get a better overall coffee experience elsewhere.   The drive-thru at this location is constantly busy, as well, making it a poor option for getting your hot drink quickly."}
{"text":"Black coffee and the croissants made fresh daily and the price is very reasonable. Its better than Starbucks all day everyday, even twice on Sunday's. When I visit Montreal, I go to Tim Hortons for my morning breakfast."}
{"text":"Couldn't understand the order taker who didn't speak clear English and the cookies we ordered were burned and tasted awful."}
{"text":"Like most Tim Horton's, this location is efficient and serves a good breakfast sandwich and donuts. It is always busy but the wait is usually short."}
{"text":"I don't know what I can say other than that the service has declined to the point where I simply don't come here anymore. Slow to come to the counter, slow to fill the order, and frequent mistakes. Food quality wasn't as good either.  It's a shame, as I liked coming in for lunch once in a while, but it's simply not worth the aggravation anymore."}
{"text":"This Tims is the closest one to the Oakville GO Station, so if you've got some time before your train leaves - or just missed one - it's a good place to grab a beverage and a snack. A bit too far if you're walking and have less than about 20 minutes, though.  As far as Hortons go, it's got a bit of a weird layout inside - the counter curves around the kitchen area. I'm fairly sure that this is a side effect of this building originally being a Burger King, at least 15 years ago. Since then, it became a Hortons, and at one point was - and might still be - a corporate training store. What this means is that there are often an excess of people present, from all over North America, but depending on where you are in the training cycle, they may be completely clueless. It also means a fairly high turnover for employees.  Seating area is a bit odd - partially because I don't think this one's been renovated in a while, and probably also owing to the Burger King roots. Plastic benches throughout, as opposed to the more chair-based approach taken by newer Timmy's.   Food is pretty standard for a Tim Hortons - not the greatest, but not bad either. They do have sandwiches, but the counter is around the side (told you the layout was weird).  If you have Cogeco cable Internet and a Cogeco email account, you get something almost no other Tim Hortons in Canada has - FREE WIFI. Use it in good health.  Drive through is to be avoided completely during morning rush hour. Either get coffee at home, in the station, or when you get to work, because this one's gonna be packed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a 24 hour restaurant so you can always get your caffeine fix!  Ample parking in the Royal Oak shopping centre.  Good setup for ordering and pickup of food in the restaurant."}
{"text":"NPS = 8  Ok.  Maybe it's because I am on vacation in a country i haven't been to since I was 13 years old (so I guess it doesn't count), but Tim Horton's is awesome!  I had never been to a Tim Horton's before and I was really happy to see one right in the airport. I could see how Burger King would fit this into their business model.  I got a coffee and a chocolate pastry.  About $3 USD and some change.  The chocolate pastry was AMAZING (again, I wish I could gauge it's true taste without the sweet feeling of vacation boosting it up a couple of notches).  Don't tell the little Cuban bakeries back home, but this was one of the best pastelitos I had ever tried!  I'd like to see a regular Tim Horton's retail shop, not just the one in the airport.  This one had fancy TV menus and all that but I'm curious to see how they operate in their day to day.  Again, I'm a fan.  When in Canada, check out Tim Horton's!  Hell, at least grab a coffee there!"}
{"text":"Coffee is lousy, and even then they try to only fill your cup half way! When you ask for the manager they claim he/she isn't there! What a joke, both locations, on either side of the 400 need to be shut down, instant coffee from the hot water tap would be better."}
{"text":"Unbelievably, this is the last Tim Hortons in Toronto without wifi!  Location is usually packed during the day with seniors. Drive through is reasonable."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Tim Horton's so I was really unfamiliar with the menu so I asked the barista if the Maple Iced Cappuccino was better than the Regular and tried to get his opinion and he just shrugged and was like \"i guess.\" So I had to awkwardly say \"um okay\". He was really not being helpful at all as to what to get. As for the taste, I like that the coffee wasnt as strong as Starbucks' but they lack variety."}
{"text":"I was really excited for this Tim Hortons to open up as it is so close to my home. Sadly, I literally never stop by this location anymore because every single time I have gone the donuts have been stale and my coffees always taste off. There's lots of seating but the place sometime has a strange & unpleasant smell. There's also no drive through. Disappointing overall!"}
{"text":"I like Tim Hortons, but this location has employed a store full of staff that hurt the customer experience in store.  There is no sense of urgency, even when it is busy. They have staff tasking while a pileup of customers stand and watch. It's uncomfortable to eat inside because of all the ppl standing in line are standing in the dining area. There is never seating available on the other side of the store bc those ppl also don't want to eat their food staring at the rear ends of the standing customers.  The staff talk amongst themselves all the time. I wouldn't mind this as much if they didn't stop working evertime they want socialize.  I once saw the owner in store, and when he saw a lineup of 4 guests, he told the staff in the back  to work the front. And they did! 3 of them came out and supported 1 cashier and 1 food prep person working. I've never seen them move as fast as I did that day. Maybe the manager should come around more often.  Also they charge money for... Get this... Packaged Ketchup! What?!   I'm going to start going to the other location in the area bc I'm just fed up at this point."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this Timmy's lately and can say they have a solid 4 stars. Unfortunately they don't have a drive thru, but usually there is ample parking throughout the day.   I've never had any complaints about the food here. It comes promptly and freshly almost every time.   Drinks are good as well. Never had a problem.   The reason why it's 4 stars is that the team here has always been fast, efficient, and friendly. It's also cutely decorated depending on the holiday.   Solid Timmy's. 4/5."}
{"text":"Been at Tim Hortons twice. The first time over a year ago and the other time a few days ago. Their staff both times were friendly, and muffins were good. The latte being better than I would have thought notwithstanding, was not as good as at some other coffee spots. 4.4 out of 5 is fair enough. BTW, my husband says their wraps are awesome."}
{"text":"In order to review this location, I was forced to give it a star. And that's being generous! I felt that everyone should be warned prior to visiting this downtown location.   This has got to be the worst service; granted it was \"rush hour\", but it shouldn't take almost 20 minutes to make a simple turkey panini. What was even more aggravating was seeing people having ordered after me get their food first. The cashier gave me my coffee right after ordering, but I wanted to wait for my panini so as to not drink the whole thing prior to eating. By the time I actually got the chance to sit down and \"enjoy\" my panini and coffee, it was lukewarm at best. So disappointing.  Avoid ordering food here at all costs!"}
{"text":"This location here always has everything in stock at any time, which I appreciate. Some locations run out of donuts, wedges etc. The staff here are great as well, if they mess up an order, they make another one right away. Also if you ever want a quiet spot to work, this is great since the WiFi is so strong!"}
{"text":"Only place that always get's my Caffè Mocha just right! You would think they have it somehow measured out how much hot chocolate and how much coffee they should pour into each cup but every other location varies from day to day. This one no matter what time of day or what server... I get the perfect cup every time!  But god forbid you gotta stop here in the morning on your way to work...it's a nightmare...the parking lot and drive thru are a total mess..."}
{"text":"You're in a prime spot just a block away from Union Station, and yet they never have enough staff on, so the line ups to get served become ridiculous. Last time I was in there 20 minutes before giving up waiting and going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why, but I really struggle with this location.   I find the drive through staff to be consistently rude/inconsistent/immature (or something!).  I find it hard to articulate what it is that bothers me about the service.  While the drive through times are usually pretty decent, quality suffers for this.  I get the wrong muffin/doughnut variety about 20% of the time (chocolate chip muffin is NOT a chocolate dip doughnut), and I feel like I'm always doing them a favour by ordering.  My biggest pet peeve with this location is that I am always getting cut off when placing my order.  I won't be done saying \"large triple milk\" before they interrupt me to say \"anything else?\"....I understand that expediency is a key aspect of the business model (I worked at a Timmies myself for years), but keep it together people!!!"}
{"text":"As usual, there's a line up. Let's hope I get a good cup of coffee this time. Like most timmys, it's a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Coffee and  maple  donut is my favorite here!  Tim Horton's is similar to Winchels, a variety of freshly baked donuts that you can find at Winchel's, however I would say if there was any difference, the doughiness of the donuts seemed to be a different, maybe a little more doughy, and also I believe the sweetness is just a tad held back, which is a good thing.   My only complaint is that this particular one, the dining area was a little unkept and messy, but overall this is a great donut shop, so I'd say this is one of Montreal's gems!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this Tim's on my way to work at 8:30. When I got to the drive through there were 5 cars in front of me; I was pleasantly surprised at how quick the process went. I didn't wait much at all. I ordered a bagel with butter and a coffee. The coffee was very hot and fresh. My bagel was buttered just enough! The bagel was also very fresh. The cashier was quick and efficient. I would defiantly come back, hopefully the service and quality stay the same!"}
{"text":"Canada, what's the big deal about Tim Horton's? I heard great things so I waited in the queue about 10 minutes for a cup of brewed coffee and two doughnuts that tasted worse than what you'd find in a truck stop. Where's the Starbucks at Toronto Pearson International? No espresso-based drinks, \"real fruit smoothies\" are just juice concentrate mixed with ice and the doughnut glaze tasted saccharine and fake - like pure high fructose corn syrup. Move along folks."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to visit other Tim locations....I dreadfully pass by this one on my way to the doctors so I usually end up ordering.  This location always messes up my drink orders. My iced cap had no ice at all. It was just cool liquid. I was in a rush to the doctors so I didn't have time to go back. And then when my mom ordered last time, they used the table cloth to wipe the the edge of the rim when they overfilled it...The edge of the rim...where she was going to drink from...looks unsanitary. I would not have taken that drink had it been me.   The only redemption is that they make a mean grilled cheese panini. If I know I have to pass by this location, I always bring my water bottle with me for my thirst needs now."}
{"text":"pretty average location, a bit slow in the service all around, it seems like alot of the workers are new hires. one of the newer locations in this neck of the woods, very clean, a little bit of sitting area, and a few places to park. quality of the food is good"}
{"text":"this location is what I would call, rough around the edges.  inconsistent service leads to angry customers at times, and on some occasions when I have gone here, some of the machines are down, including a time when more then one was down. the bathroom is almost always left in shambles, and the waiting area is showing its age, even though it just went through a recent renovation. the staff are not to friendly at this location either. just not a very impressive location carrying the Tim Hortons name. transit friendly, but no parking at this location."}
{"text":"the take out window is absolutely awesome.  being inside a shoppers as well makes this location awesome. quick and flawless service, happy staff, and efficiency makes this location an absolute powerhouse.  pretty much always clean and worth coming to check out.  really close to Coxwell station as well."}
{"text":"being on Yonge street in the middle of the downtown core is defiantly a tough gig. this location is very clean, with lots of seating, and most of the workers have a sense of urgency with them. quick and correct service. I look forward to coming to this location because of all of these reasons."}
{"text":"not a location I go to often, but its above average from a standard location, being attached to Vaughan mills makes it a bit of a zoo just to go into the \"Vaughan Mills Centre\" just to get a cup of coffee. having said that, the only knock against this location would be that sometimes the drive thru line-up seems to be never ending. the service is great though."}
{"text":"short and sweet, and nothing sweet about it. this location is very convenient, but brings a lot of disgruntled customers. been here a couple of times and witnessed some really weird stuff go down, im not sure whats causing it but I generally avoid this location. they just went through a new renovation, but a lot of the visible aspects look very worn. sadly this is the only tim hortons in this section of Toronto(aside from the hospital, which isn't open 24hrs) so the other option is mcds."}
{"text":"one of the newer locations, which is nice and awesome, but the service is not up to par. all of the staff are pretty green. great accessibility in this neighborhood via car and transit. this location is super clean, cause its new, and generally the staff are really happy."}
{"text":"nothing special about this tim hortons, the drive thru is SUPER tight, so make sure your not driving a large vehicle, the service is average as far as tim hortons go, the staff are super friendly, and the location is generally clean. often times in the warmer weather there is a fair bit of people loitering on the outside of this establishment i've found."}
{"text":"this location is greater then most, I almost wish it was attached to the subway station. about a 1-3 minute walk from bloor-yonge this location cranks out coffee like its no ones business. they literally dominate this neighborhood in both volume and service. staff is really good here having to deal with high volume all day, not much room to sit and enjoy a coffee though, with the high volume sometimes you cant find a seat.  my only complaint is there is a guy who opens the door and asks for change, if you don't give change he is a pretty intolerable person to deal with.  otherwise a great location."}
{"text":"this location is great, for the staff, for the area, and for the quality/freshness of the food. lots of seating but no parking is available on the street, some underground lots in the neighborhood. my main complaint about this location is the amount of beggars inside the store, or just at the door which makes it frustrating for coming in and coming out. this location is also pretty open with plenty of seating in the area. another great thing/feature about this location is how bright it is with all of the windows and natural sunlight that comes in. transit wise, its a quick walk from either union station or ST Andrew. great location that is above average."}
{"text":"a great place to get a cup of coffee.  across the street from davisville subway station, this location is absolutely dynamite in every aspect, the service is outstanding, the quality is great, the location is always clean.  I've always been at this location during rush hour and tis always been in and out.  not sure about the parking situation, but its a less then 3 minute walk from the subway which is amazing in my eyes.  very happy with this location."}
{"text":"slightly below a normal tim hortons, the drive thru takes utterly forever to get through, which often leads to fits of rage, although they have never messed up an order of mine, its just a super frustrating location that i often find myself avoiding unless i absolutely have to do to it.  drive thru is a good size, and the parking lot has ample parking, ive never been inside this location, so thats all i got for a review."}
{"text":"one of the better tim hortons for the neighborhood, but sadly just par for the course. this location has run out of numerous items in the past, the drive thru is super slow, even though the drive thru is what staff seem to care about. this location is clean and has an abundance of parking, more so since target is no longer in this area. the staff are neutral, and i hate saying this, but they dont seem to have the drive that certain tim hortons do, or urgency, or customer service. it really is the best of the worst for the area. not a fan, but when I'm in the neighborhood, i don't want to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"this Tim Horton's is a GEM, an absolute gem, not only is it connected to Pape station, but they have a window, so you don't even have to leave the station to get coffee. great service at this location, even though the line ups are pretty brutal to deal with, not leaving the station is absolutely amazing part to this location.  very very happy with my experiences at this station over the last season.  no places to sit that is directly tied to tim hortons, but a bench from the station might be open for seating."}
{"text":"as other people have said, the drive thru for this location is amazingly quick.  trying to park in the parking lot, to go in for a \"bigger\" then normal order is very painful, the layout with the gas station means you have to up your guard when you're slowly trying to find a parking spot, cause people are whipping in and out without any discretion whatsoever"}
{"text":"above average tim hortons, always open, always great service, closest location to my workplace. out of the two years of going to this location, they've never messed up my order."}
{"text":"If you want to meet a doctor, this is the place to be.   Situated across the road from Foothills Medical Centre, the usual crowd of this Tim Hortons is comprised of Doctors, Residents, Nurses, Med and Heath Sciences Students and other university/patient populations. The parking lot here is a nightmare if you are trying to visit at any other time of day after 7 am. The shop is fairly small and the line snakes around the entire establishment. Surly staff, who seem to be going a little slow, but if I was in my mid-fifties and working in a Tim Hortons, I would be surly too.  Only thing good about this store is it is a 24 hour location, which is nice, especially for those shift medical workers. Great for last minute breakfast \"catering\" . Though I was charged for 12 muffins and only got 6. Where are my other 6 muffins!? The muffin man will tear out my soul."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons is in a tiny plaza, there's no drive thru.  Its the typical Tim's nothing special about it.  It closed early.  I was there once when the manager (or owner) was there screaming at one of the women working g there. I'm not sure what was being said, it was on another language but I would have just walked away.    I try not to go here because of that. I do think need to hear that."}
{"text":"Wow what a great Place! Tim Hortons has more locations in Canada then McDonalds. this place is great. A little more \"upscale\" then other fast food places. I wish there was one near us in Pennsylvania... I could have eaten every meal at one of these places.."}
{"text":"First time to TH.  They expected me to understand some standard TH things like sugar, cream serving amounts, how to get utensils that I was unaware of.  Probably speedy service normally but a bit clumsy help if you've never been to TH before.  Breakfast and coffee were good."}
{"text":"I don't know how people could work so slow. I understand if they had only few staff but they had 5people on the floor and still couldn't mange to move line. I couldn't believe my eyes, how can people be so slow at doing their job. It's pouring coffe, drinks and making few little things. It shouldn't take more thn ins max 3. The management team needs to get fired and start fresh with people who actually know how to speak English and not bunch of people who are Filipino and their family members al work together at the same location. This has been the worse timmies I have been to. If you are in a rush, do not go to this location."}
{"text":"if this is the location across the canada post plant by mcknight, omg!! the service is bad, employees cant understand instructions, well, i should say because they are understaffed.   if you are uber hungry i guess that is ok. but if you have choice....9 out of 10 they get your order wrong. how do i know? because i go there when i dont have anything to eat during work and nothing around is open and this is close to my work place.   dont even talk about the washroom....eeekkkkk...do i need to say more. no service at all...oh yah, 4 out of 5 times i see flies where they keep the donuts...yikes that is so gross! i dont know how they get away with it. when i see the flies...i dont even order any of the donut even if i am craving for one. well, its not only 1 fly...most of the time there are couple of 'em"}
{"text":"This is my worst experience. They made mistakes in my order and then yelled at me. Say no whole wheat bread, after my harsh counterattack. I got my  whole wheat bread. Never going again."}
