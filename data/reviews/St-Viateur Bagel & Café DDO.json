{"text":"Love love love these bagels. 
Nice sized café with friendly service. Well situated near bus stops if you are a BMW-er (bus, metro, walk) living in the west island. 
Bagels are warm when you get them, and you can watch them making them!
I have yet to try out their eating section though, just grabbing my fix before I head back to boring bagel-Vancouver. 
Everyone should try one at least once in their lives. Montreal bagels are the best in the world!!"}
{"text":"Bets Bagels ever! The place itself is nothing special and not worth going for lunch but it is worth heading over there to pick up a dozen bagels and enjoy with cream cheese."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Montreal and a friend suggested trying the bagels. Was curious about the hype and stumbled across this place with a couple of friends. 

Parking is adequate and the place is clean and neat. Staff is very friendly and helpful when choosing from their variety of bagels. Service was prompt and we really liked being able to see the bagels being hand made and baking inside the brick oven behind the register. The bakery also serves as a quaint cafe with adequate seating and large windows which allows ample natural light. Feels like a quiet and relaxing place to get some bagels and coffee in the morning.

Bagels were pretty good. Freshly baked and aromatic. They had a good bite to them but soft and airy on the inside. I really liked the cinnamon raisin bagel but even the plain bagel was pretty good on its own."}
{"text":"Overall very average compared to the hype. Not sure if it was just a bad store of the chain, but the bagels, sandwiches, and cafe selections were what I would expect from a cheap, express stop. Bagels did not taste fresh and were thin/dry, the club sandwich was okay, and the mango  tasted like cheap filter. Slightly dissapointed. Maybe the spots closer to Montreal are more promising for their famous bagels"}
{"text":"nowhere near the quality of their main location . the bagels are thin and worst of all the outsides are dry and stale tasting . if you are on the west island, you must go to Premier Bagel in the west island. they cook their bagels a little less than the other places, so when you toast them, there is less of a chance that they'll turn into melba toast."}
{"text":"Very fresh bagels in the West Island, you can't have fresher bagels... Also super fresh salmon and cream cheese bagel sandwiches : delicious :))"}
{"text":"If you live in the West, and have family over for brunch, then come here to pick up the almond croissants and fresh brick oven bagels.  There's so many bagels to choose from....Get them by the dozen or just the 1.

There are 2 cashes - 1 cash to pay for the coffee/jams/refrigerated items or the pastries to go. And the other is a counter at the other end of the shop if you want to order a bagel to eat in-store.  I typically get the all-dressed bagel toasted with cream cheese.  It's served on a plate with fruits and a whopping amount of cream cheese, or butter/margarine, and with 5-6 halves of a bagel.

I also tried their regular coffee and it is good.

It's a good bagel shop hands-down.  If you'd like, there's a picnic table out on the grass at the curb, but, have never seen anyone use it.

If you do eat in-store, be aware of the high chairs at the counter along the windows....I swear, they're out to get me!  My bf and I always trip over them!  You'd think we've learned by now!  It's like someone stuck their foot out to trip you, but, they're just the rear legs on the chairs! I imagine they cackle as I walk away..."}
{"text":"I used to partake in the silly St. Viateur vs Fairmont debate, teeter-tottering between the two sides of the debate, my changing opinion mirroring the various phases of my life. And then I moved to Toronto, and one thing became very clear to me: Montreal is good at making bagels.

Don't get me wrong. Toronto has great food. But, the city's lame excuse of a bagel is embarrassing, cringe-worthy even. Torontonians will take a piece of round dried bread, cut out a whole in the middle, sprinkle some sesame seeds on top, and then have the audacity to call that atrocity a \"bagel\". Ugh.

Anyway, enough about the Toronto \"bagels\". St. Viateur is great. I always make sure to drop by and stock up whenever I visit my parents. You walk into the shop and are immediately met with the smell of fresh baked goods. The bagels are fresh and still warm when you buy them. The price you're paying for them is honestly such a bargain (might be a little biased here, because I'm comparing this with my Toronto experiences). And the quality is top-notch."}
{"text":"Glad to have one of these in the west island but it seems to be unmarked from the outside? I was with my brother who already knew it was there but you really can't tell it's there until you walk up to the door. It's located in a small squat commercial building on the 'southeast' corner (it's technically due east but you know how Montrealers always think of the island as a bit shifted..) of Brunswick and Tecumseh. There is a parking lot and the store entrance is closest to the parking lot entrance off Tecumseh. 

Anyway, you can watch fresh bagels being made on one side, and there is a café on the other. It's a large and clean space. I find St-Viateur bagels to be a bit thicker than Fairmont but they are still good. Several different kinds but I'm not sure that they always have them in stock (sesame and poppy are always available though). Eating a fresh bagel is the best bit if you're bringing them home to freeze, be sure to let them cool fully before putting them in the plastic bags that come with the paper ones!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way from the city to Cap St. Jacques and it was the perfect breakfast. I'm not a bagel connoisseur, but I thought the sandwiches we had were great. My husband and I split the Traditional (smoked salmon) and the smoked meat sandwiches. They came with tons of fillings which I loved. The bagels were a little thinner than most of the bagels at home (the US) but I prefer that, especially in a sandwich. The soup of the day was chili and it wasn't super exciting, but it was tasty. My chai tea latte was also solid!"}
{"text":"A little hard to find tucked away in an industrial area but I'm happy it's here. I love these bagels and this branch didn't disappoint. Friendly staff and easy parking."}
