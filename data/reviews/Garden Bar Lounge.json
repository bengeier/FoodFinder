{"text":"Had late meeting with wife. Stopped at Eat n Park it was packed . I thought let's stop at Garden Bar it's on the way home. So glad we did . Been years since we were there. Has a great clean dining area. I ordered Hot Sausage it was the best I've had in years. She ordered Rueben Sandwich and it was really ,really good. Also two large really cold YingLing,s  Service was great, food was superb you owe it to yourselves to eat there it's well worth the time."}
{"text":"So, GB is right around the corner. I frequently drive past and see many cars outside. I knew we would eventually give it a try. 
Sent hubs for take out on a recent Friday evening. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and fresh cut fries. The quesadilla was adequate. Grilled chicken, cheese, lettuce, tomato, salsa and sour cream. The salsa was tasty. Chunky and flavorful. Possibly homemade. The fries were horrendous. Soggy and bland. No salt.
Hubs also said the inside of the bar is very smoky. Although they do have a restaurant section that is separate, the smoke is still easily detected."}
{"text":"The garden bar, a landmark in the south hills.. kind of. It's on gardenville, which separates bethel and Baldwin, the garden bar sits right past the viaduct.
It is a great \"old man\" bar but it's also a great place to eat. The food is fresh and actually really good! The bar is bar is now smoke free so it's not bad to stop in for a beer. Mostly the standard domestic drafts; Miller, bud etc. but they have a few crafts in bottles
Cheap beer and good food in a quite spot easy to get to and plenty of parking.
They have great fish specials on fridays and the games on Sunday
The only downside is they close really early, sometimes 10 depending on the crowd, so don't plan any late night stops"}
