{"text":"The food is really good and tasty. The owner and staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  They are also very accommodating to large parties."}
{"text":"By chance, I had dinner at this restaurant. It is described as modern Indian food. A perfect description. We had two dishes, a fish coconut curry, and panneer sagg. Both were perfectly cooked and spiced. Presentation was also wonderful. Very nice atmosphere  I am new to Toronto from Vancouver and have been looking for a great Indian restaurant. I have found such a place. I will be returning, often."}
{"text":"I usually get the butter chicken with the na'an bread. Food is prepared very quickly and always tastes hot enough and just right. The customer service is top notch and the prices are very affordable. I really enjoy coming here and I will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Always quality food, generous portions, and utterly delicious. It always blows my mind that people are lined up for Terronni across the street, when you can walk right into cosy Appalla sit down and have a quality meal without standing and waiting.  Friendly, great. A nice paced meal, romantic even. Pleased to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided we were in the mood for Indian, and based on the Yelp reviews and the close proximity to us we decided to give Apalla a try for a sit-down dinner. We were not disappointed.

We had three dishes (butter chicken, beef vindaloo, and a veg dish I don't remember the name of). All three were very good. They warned us the vindaloo and they were not kidding! But they were nice enough to take it down a notch (which was still not mild enough for my wife but fine for me). Toss in rice and garlic naan and the total came in under $40 before HST which seems like a good deal to this Vancouver transplant.

Service was also very friendly and helpful. When my wife needed milk to cool off her mouth from the spice they brought it free of charge. All other requests were handled promptly and with a smile.

Overall we were quite happy with our meal and expect to go back! Only missing a star because it was not a \"OMG how can they do this at those prices!\" meals."}
{"text":"Just came back from apalla.  The food was excellent quality.  Portions were right and service was great.  It was our first time there and we will return soon."}
{"text":"Good food 
Good service in restaurant and for take out
Never ordered delivery, so no comments there
Butter chicken is addicting!"}
{"text":"Great food at the great price. Just right amount of spices and just right amount of food as well which is rare when you go for Indian. We definetely will be back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here about ten times (eat in/take out) and the food is very consistent and great. The service has been fantastic every time. I love their Butter Chicken, it is absolutely delicious.  I would definitely recommend eating here. 

The atmosphere and interior design could improve but it's a minor issue when the food is good"}
{"text":"We ordered take out last night from Apalla. It was delivered via Just Eat and came exactly at the time that I selected, which was a nice surprise (Indian always seems to take a very long time for delivery). 
Ordered achari chicken, saag paneer and daal. One order of naan and raita. 
First off, there was no rice. I couldn't imagine ANYONE eating Indian food without rice. I am not sure if this was a mistake or rice is to be ordered separately, but if it was the latter, they should have said something when I ordered because who in their right mind would want indian food without rice? I would have happily paid extra to have it, if only I had known it wouldn't have come with our order. Amazingly, we had leftover rice in the fridge that we were able to reheat and eat with our dinner. 
In the meantime, we set about dipping the naan in the lentils and realized that an order of naan was only two small pieces. I have come to expect when eating at an indian restaurant, a nice basket full of fluffy naan. Again, if they had indicated on the menu that it was only half of a wheel of naan, then I would have ordered more. 
Besides these surprises, the food was excellent. The achari chicken was a nice mix of sour and spice, with the dill flavor quite complementary. The lentils and spinach were probably considered \"mild\" but did have a bit of heat that might be too intense for the more sensitive of palates. The raita was a bit thinner than I am used to, but helped balance the smokiness of the main dishes nonetheless. 
Overall, it was delicious and I would definitely order from Apalla again. My only recommendation is if you're going to do something out of the ordinary (not provide rice with entrees or give smaller than usual portions of naan) please let the customer know!"}
{"text":"Ive ordered lots of indian in the city and apalla does it just the way i like it. The tikka masala is amazing and anything else ive tried has always been good and worth ordering twice. 
Service is friendly and during the week quite speedy service. Weekends a little longer but thats to be expected :)
This is a go to spot for ordering in dinner for me! Highly recommend with great vegetarian options as well!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Apalla for the first time last night and it was delicious!  We ordered the butter chicken and the lamb vindaloo, ate very well, and ended up taking quite a bit in a to-go bag.  We were the only two in the restaurant for the first 30 mins of the meal which tends to worry my husband when a place is completely empty.  The server was great, very nice.  The music has room for improvement.  It was the same two songs played over and over.  We learned that take out is %15 off with free delivery.  I recommend Apalla, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"**This restaurant has moved to 1433 Gerrard St. East in Little India**

This Indian restaurant is by far one of the very best in the city, and is my personal favourite. It recently moved from its Queen West location to Little India on Gerrard St. East. We used to go all the time at its old location and now we will continue to make the trip to the east end for the food. It is a welcomed addition to Little Indian which has previously been lacking really high quality food. We had the chicken tikkka masala ($11) and the paneer korma ($11) (not currently on the new menu, but ask for it and they will make it) and both dishes were by far the best we have ever had! You will not be disappointed with any dish you get here. 

The food is out of this world and it is insanely cheap! Check out the menu with prices here: 

http://apalla.com/menus/apalla_cuisine_menu.pdf

The service is fantastic. They are so kind, attentive and really nice people. 

Don't let the d√©cor sway you. They have not made any changes yet from the previous restaurant's interior (Skylark) and even the lettering of their name outside resembles the old sign (they told us a new one is currently in the works) but it is NOTHING like Skylark. The chef is completely different, the food is incomparable, it's just physically, the restaurant still looks the same."}
{"text":"Maybe this review might need a second chance in the future...but as of my last visit there, I'm not planning to return unless I'm conveniently nearby. 

My friend, that lives outside of Toronto, came to visit me and we always go out for Indian food when she comes to visit. It's what we do best. After reading some good reviews from Yelp, I brought her here for early dinner. Since we were hungry after shopping around Queen St. West area, we decided to go for an early dinner here at 5PM. Yes, we knew they just opened, but we saw a table of 4 already seated, so it seemed appropriate to go in right at 5PM. 

The waiter was nice, but the service was quite slow....and do put in consideration, it was only two seated tables at the time - us and one other table. The man gave us the menu, but did not give us any water. We had to ask for it. After ordering, it took 25-30 minutes for them to bring out our food. The waiters didn't come by to check on us or fill up our empty water glasses. My friend had to ask them for more water. It was an awkward dinner throughout considering they were staring at us at the back the whole time. Kind of made dinner very uncomfortable knowing we were being watched...and to make it even more uncomfortable, there were two waiters who were doing that to us! 

The food was average, but pretty bad comparing to other Indian restaurants we've been to. When I go to a new Indian restaurant, I always order butter chicken. (I HAVE TO, that's how I judge the restaurant! :P ) This location butter chicken was not good enough for me to crave for it, not as good as the one from Banjara, which probably the best I ever had. My friend ordered a vegetarian dish and she didn't like it. She was very disappointed. 

Probably not returning back anytime soon, but I will probably give this restaurant another chance in the future (maybe...)."}
{"text":"Really delicious Indian food. We had it delivered and it was fantastic. Chicken was tender, sauce was perfect, food was well flavoured. Best Indian takeout I've had in the city!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I eat here as often as I can considering the distance I live from it. I find that sometimes there their dishes surprise me with some sweetness which isn't bad, just well... surprising. Also, if you are a big Naan eater be sure to order extra as it never seems quite enough to sop up all that delicious butter chicken sauce! I also found out that they deliver (check out their website for the phone number) no need to use Just Eat or any of those other websites."}
{"text":"I LOVE Indian food, and this place has great tasting food that is fairly priced.

My friend and I had... 

Dehli fish curry, 
Paneer korma, 
Garlic naan, 
and this awesome rice with peas that I forget the name of!

I also had a Mango Lassi that was to my liki.

My absolute favorite was the Paneer Korma, so rich and flavourful, I'm getting serious cravings just typing about it.

The service was great, and answered all my annoying questions about this n that with grace. He even suggested that two naan might be too much and that we should start with one. Stellar service!

The place was empty, but there was also a snow storm happening on a Thursday night. A few people came in and out for takeout which is a good sign.

I would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Had the Lunch Buffet today.   Food was fresh and tasty.  They brought us fresh tandoori chicken, naan, and rice to the table, on top of a great selection at the hot table. Nice spice. They don't have a proper tandoor oven, but very few in the city do. Only Trimurti, Banjara, and Aroma that I am aware of. So although the butter chicken was delicious, It didn't have that juicy on the in inside, charred on the outside texture/flavour.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Indian I have had in Toronto! It's amazing! The service is great too and delivery doesn't take too long.  Incredible butter chicken, mattaar paneer and the best aloo gobi. Not greasy, feels much less unhealthy than other Indian I've had. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Absolute best Indian Restaurant in the City!  I have posted a number of reviews, am of South Asian decent, and have to say these guys have the best food in the City!  I used to live downtown but since moved uptown.  Anytime I am near the Queen area, I MUST get take out to go home at the minimum.  There is a super busy chef in the back named Ricky who used to literally do it all.  I would laugh my face off as he would take your order, run to the back, cook, AND take your bill.... Thank God the man hired some help, which appears to be his brother or something from India.  

Portions are not huge, but the man can really cook!!!!!  Must go!  I almost feel like I am writing this to send him more people so he can stay open.  

My vote as best hidden Gem in Toronto....."}
{"text":"My partner and I love a good curry (he's South African and I come from a West Indian family), and we're also lazy, so we order in a lot. We've tried every Indian place that will deliver to us, and Apalla is the only one that consistently pleases both of us. I should also mention that I'm veg and he's most decidedly not. Yet. 

We've tried several dishes and they've all been winners, so I don't think you can go wrong here. And he portions and prices are both very good, which is part of our criteria. 

Note:  We've never eaten at the restaurant itself, but I walk by all the time and it looks quite nice. 

Delivery takes about an hour, but we know that so it's no big surprise. This isn't mass produced pizza, after all. 

4 thumbs up from the vegetarian and the meat-eater!"}
{"text":"I only tried this place once because I had a craving for Indian food in the area and this place had solid yelp ratings..so why not?  Boy...was I thrown for a loop.  I did not find the dishes authentic at all as they seemed to lack the full spices and flavors one would expect.  

Let me just cut to the chase, like many \"ethnic\" places on Queen West, this place seems designed for a western palate and not in a good way.  The Chana Masala and Eggplant dishes I tried were mediocre.  You honestly could find better Indian food in a food court.  

Maybe I've just been exposed to real indian food in TO burbs and other countries during my travels but this place was just a major let down.  I couldn't go to bed at night giving this place any more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"** Delivery Review***

I am not professional when it comes to Indian as it just entered my diet only recently but anytime I have a craving, I always call Apalla. The food is always fresh with the appropriate amount of spice. I'm yet to have a less than perfect meal. My Go to Meal includes: Vegetable Pakora. I always get the right amount for two people, Chicken Tikka Masala and 3 slices of Naan (one of which is always Garlic)

When I call the restaurant or answer the door for delivery, everyone working there always is friendly and warm.

The only downfall is that sometimes the delivery is a bit slow. This usually only occurs during peak hours so I cannot blame them.

Overall, delightful experience... always"}
{"text":"After a really bad delivery experience that found us waiting over 2 hours for our food when we're only a 5 minute walk, we had a much easier time with our order a few months ago.

I actually emailed the restaurant in addition to writing an unfavourable review. The owner thanked me for my email and authorized a free appetizer the next time we come in for dinner. 

We haven't made it back yet to use the voucher, but did order delivery. When I called, the woman who answered the phone remembered who I was when I asked how long the delivery was expected to take.  She also warned me that it would be almost an hour since they were very busy. That's fair. An hour is no big deal as long as I'm expecting it to take that long.

Food was good. Not outstanding as it usually is, but this is a solid place for delivery and an even better place to dine in. Props for acknowledging customer feedback and acting on it. This shows that they value their customers, which is rare and welcomed this day in age."}
{"text":"The servers are very friendly and willing to make conversation.   The food is good, but almost everything tastes the same.   They use the same sauce base for everything it seems - except the tandoori chicken which is nicely done.   I happen to like their sauce so its okay for me, but some Indian connoisseurs I ate with were less impressed."}
{"text":"One star- for good customer service ! 

Myself and my hubby went to this place after travelling from Mississauga and took ttc from Main Street .. And ended up eating at this place as we were starving. Guess what, the food was horrible , 6 veg and 6 meat dishes .. I tried the veggie ones and my hubby did the others.. Can't express how bad the food was, tasted pretty bad , not even close to a North Indian tasting dish.. Rice was dried and had crispy taste to it..! 

We will definitely not be coming to this place again on gerrad St. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"By far the best Indian takeout! My boyfriend and I always get the dinner for two and its decently priced, gets to our place quickly and most importantly is delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends, a couple of nights ago. The food was fantastic. 

We ordered samosa's, mixed pickle, poppadoms and raita to start. We then just spilt curries and ordered lamb vindaloo, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala and saag paneer and some garlic nan's. The lamb vindaloo was off the scale good, super tender and perfectly spiced. The portions are not huge but very filling. We split 4 curries between 5 and still had some leftovers. 

The service was fine, no complaints!"}
{"text":"The butter chicken was awesome.  The naan bread wasn't as light and fluffy as it should have been but the portions are huge and very friendly on the phone.  We also got the Josh Rogan and Paneer.  Both good but the winner was the butter chicken!"}
{"text":"Good stuff all in all, Apalla has turned into my go-to delivery Indian joint.

Im a big fan of their pakoras to start, with some tikka masala and tasty naan to finish.  Their tandoori chicken is also pretty good, and is all boneless pieces of chicken breast with lots of sauce, just like butter chicken or tikka masala, whereas a lot of places in the past I've had tandoori from are actual chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, breasts, etc) that have been baked in a tandoori oven and less saucey and usually on the bone. So take that into consideration if you are looking for more of a half/full chicken when ordering."}
{"text":"Been waiting to try this for a while and it was worth the wait. The service is great! They were so helpful when I ordered on the phone. When I got there they were helpful when I had credit card issues, very courteous every step of the way.

The food, I ordered the butter chicken which I felt was just a tad less creamy than I thought it'd be but still had ample flavor. The Goan seafood curry had several pieces of shrimp, only one scallop which was slightly disappointing though it was a big scallop, and not sure if the fish was supposed to be minced as there were no chunks. The flavor though was delicious, so rich in what I think is cumin. 

Surprisingly they weren't too busy when I walked in. A few takeout orders but I was expecting in-room diners.

I would order from them again, especially for their seafood Goan curry, though I have to admit I have no idea what it's supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"I think all I can say right now that describes the way I feel about the butter chicken I had from this place is: ORGAASMIC. I'd actually give it a 10 out of 5 if I could.

It was a visual AND nasal feast from the moment the food arrived and the thick, flavorful and buttery sauce with Naan was heavenly.

A side note is that when you get delivery, they bring it up to your unit - you don't have to run down to the lobby.

That is all....they are awesome;  in every possible way and I guarantee that your stomach and your taste buds  will be fully satisfied."}
{"text":"Oh. Mah. Gah. 

I'm not joking. 

The BEST Indian food I've put in my mouth and I lived in London several months on end. I had the fish with spinach and the eggplant potato vegetarian dish with potato Naan. Absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"I think this ranks as one of my favourite Indian places in the city. The food is always perfect and fast, and the woman who usually serves us is so friendly and helpful. They also change their menu often, which is nice since there is usually somethihng new to try, or something I haven't seen in a while. 

**Disclaimer - I'm vegetarian so I have never had their meat dishes**

I have never used Just Eat for their delivery, but I usually don't like to use services like that since they charge a fee to the user (me) and commission to the restaurant. I would rather give my money directly to them, especially since they're so small. 

Delivery is very good, well above average for an Indian restaurant. Also, the portions are much larger with delivery than if you eat in the restaurant, and the containers are good for storing leftovers in the fridge. 

Eris B. complained that rice wasn't included with their meal, and she is correct to assume that you need to order it separately. The naan is delicious, but on the light side portion wise, so order a bit extra. The rice portions are huge - one per two people is enough. I recommend the peas pulao. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Have only been here once - on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch, and it was very quiet.  They have a lunch combo special which reminds me of a bento box.  You get to choose one meat and two veggie dishes from a small selection.  I had chicken tikka masalla, chickpeas, and spinach and cheese.  It also comes with rice and naan, so needless to say it is a very hearty lunch!  The naan was not as great as some that I've had, but everything else was delicious."}
{"text":"Appalla was appalling. Sorry i had to.

I've heard this is a much better place to take out that dine in.

In any case, i went here with two friends without a plan, and the place was completely empty. As a result, the service was extremely slow. To the point of frustration.
 The decor is as you would expect at any Indian place. Depressing music and red table cloths. The service was a little awkward but not bad. 

The food was not impressive. The portions were way too small, the side orders were annoying, the food tasted like it was not very authentic.

I think this place is a 2.5 with potential. I don't want to say its the worst place, but i'm definitely not going back here any time soon. They really have to still work on flavour and value at this place for their prices relative to other Indian restaurants. 

I hate to say this, but it's not made for people who know the cuisine well."}
{"text":"Some of the best butter chicken I've had! They're buffet is pretty good too, although I've only had it once. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Some of the best butter chicken I've had! They're buffet is pretty good too, although I've only had it once. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery- it did take a full hour but was worth the wait.

The chicken Tikka Masala was outstanding. Although I was hoping it would be dairy free I think there was a touch of cream or butter in there, it was too good not to have it. It was rich but not over the top. It had green peppers which I usually am not a fan of but didn't mind them in this curry.

Chana Masala had a lot of flavour and was really great- but I liked the Chicken more...
Naan bread tasted fresh and homemade, and the basmati rice was great (fluffy, with cumin seeds).

Is love to try this place again and in person to check out the ambiance. I will definitely order from here again.

Also- the leftovers were even better the next day."}
{"text":"Very good Indian restaurant! Although the service was a bit slow, it was very tasty. 

I ordered the Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken. If you like a stronger flavour, order the Tikka Masala and make sure you ask for extra spicy to bring up the heat. The butter chicken was mild and tasted almost sweet, but i liked their spin on it. 

Also, make sure you order the rice and naan on the side since the meat dish itself does not come with rice or bread"}
