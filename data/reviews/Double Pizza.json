{"text":"Worst service ever. Ordered 2 pizzas on a Saturday afternoon. Said it would take 40 minutes. Ended up taking 1h15 minutes. Pizzas arrived cold. Tried calling their number and was on hold for 15 minutes with some automated voice message. Finally got through and the girl in the other line was not even apologetic. Will never order from them again! Much better pizza places out there who value customer service and don't make you wait forever for 2 simples pizzas!"}
{"text":"The delivery line is really unhelpful for any request that can't be put into a computer and that can easily be ordered at the counter.  Avoid delivery unless you are drunk/hungry/inhuman enough to not care what arrives."}
{"text":"In reality, there are actually two reviews to be had here: the two star review where I question the quality of the slices and paint it as a lunch-time emergency line, and the four star review where I gush over the cheap large pizzas. So put those eyes to good use and skip ahead as needed! ;)  Slices are about what you can expect from a big chain. They have the best selection bar-none for the area if not Montreal, sure. Want hawaiian? Chicken-hawaiian? They've got that and then some. Heck, slices are cheap and big. But because they sit, they get dry, and that means some of them - particularly the meatier ones - transform from pizza to dry crust 3/4ths of the way in. Eat one in you need a quick fix, but try to plan elsewhere if you want that experience to come back to time-and-time again.  The real target, as I said, is to order a full pizza. Frequently you can get large pizzas in pepperoni or 3-ingredient denominations for $10-$3 dollars.There are of course the usual dime-a-dozen deals if you want multiple pizzas or other items, but even just a single pizza comes out very nice if you order for pickup. It was frankly a little surprising how much different it tastes compared to the by-the-slice!  In the grand scheme of things, I might look for better options if I need a pizza either way; Ste Catherine has its share of by-the-slice and by-the-pie restaurants out there - but when I need something cheap and reliable, Double Pizza is common option. It's not an elite New York Pizza joint, but if it comes to a choice between this and, say, Dominos, I'll take Double Pizza every time."}
{"text":"It seemed to me that the cashier, without washing his hands, prepared one of my pizzas. This happened last night, and he also prepared several sets of fries and chicken wings for other costumers after taking their orders.  I ordered a \"Special C4\", that is: 2 x-large pizzas, a soda and a small set of fries. While the person preparing pizzas was making my first one, the cashier went ahead and poured the tomato sauce on my second pizza and proceeded to put all of the ingredients on it afterward. Yes, with his bare, unclean hands. When I noticed this, I stood up and started to observe what was going on since I never saw him leave the front and go somewhere to wash his hands. After my pizzas were in the oven and several other people came in I realized that the cashier was comfortable taking orders, giving people their change and then, without washing his hands, touching the shared utensils they have at the kitchen (pizza cutter, etc.).  Will I come back to this place? Probably, simply because it's the most comfortable thing for me to do when I'm in the mood for pizza. Plus, I want to believe that not all cashiers have this awful, unsanitary habit. As a matter of fact, I think this is the first time in 2 years I saw this specific employee."}
{"text":"\"HORRIBLE SERVICE! WORST SERVICE OF MY LIFE! the pizza was 2h late,so I tried calling them and they put me on hold for 20min! then when the delivery man came I refused to pay for a pizza i have been trying to cancel for the past half hour and he actually threatens to report me and that I will deal with consequences!! i call back to talk to there customer service and not only did they not apologize once and tried putting the blame on but they closed the line as I was talking! there is no customer service what so ever, Unprofessionalism and incompetency like I have never seen before!!\""}
{"text":"Bad budget smelly pizza. Don't stay too long in there your clothes will smell bad after."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague. If you sit at the bar seating near the window, you can stare at a years worth of dead bugs and dirt along the tops of the table while enjoying your hair-topped pizza slice. The pizza is over priced, disgusting, and the staff is rude (along with no hair nets or gloves. And they constantly touch their face while making pizza). Went there once and never again. They are in desperate need of a visit from the health inspector."}
{"text":"I believe this is the one we ordered from. We had great food come from Double Pizza. If you're just worn down from a busy trip and decide you need a night with just some pizza relaxing at a hotel, this is a recommendation. Awesome food and reasonable prices. I really suggest trying it out."}
{"text":"If i can give this piece of shit 0 star i would do it Btw there is dead bugs in my pizza how do I put 0 stars??this is a trash ass place to go,,worst pizza in the world.the bathroom is bigger than the eatin place lmao"}
{"text":"I admit, sometimes I can get down and eat the nastiest of the nasty... but this place shook my world (and my normally ironclad stomach), it was so bad.   We were caught in the middle of a crazy snowstorm and couldn't stray far from where we were staying. My boyfriend and I remembered there was a pizza joint around the corner... can't be too bad, right? WRONG.  Run down there and order poutine, some hot dogs, and a slice of pizza. They ring us up and we wait. And wait. Aaaaaannnndddd wait. Mind you - middle of a snowstorm, they're not exactly busy with customers.  Finally, I go over to the guy behind the counter and ask him what's taking so long. He looks up and realizes that he's actually supposed to be working! So he runs around, completes our order and even throws in a few free bottles of beer to make up for the wait... okay, cool.  Get back upstairs... the hot dogs weren't too bad, but pizza was cold and greasy beyond anything edible, and the poutine was downright frozen, mushy and disgusting. I actually puked, I was so grossed out... and I hardly ever puke.  Good thing we had those free beers to wash the vile taste down."}
{"text":"Ordered a 9 inch oven baked chocolate chip cookie and got a burned up 4 inch cookie . Called to ask if i could exchange it , they said sure and would send another one over. A couple minutes later get another call back saying they wont do anything and thats how its supposed to be .. needless to say this will be the last time buying from double pizza"}
{"text":"2 reviews 1.0 star rating 8/24/2016 Horrible terrible disrespectful customer service. We'll never go back. I do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and food.  Ordered pizza & wings for delivery.  Delivery was quick enough but food was terrible.  One quarter of the pizza was stuck to the lid of the box (box was crushed by some weight... possible the 2L pop bottle).  The fries that came with the wings were stone cold and I suspect were resting on the counter for some time.  When I wrote to their customer service (this was 2 weeks ago) there was never any replies.  Avoid yourself disappointment and a sorry stomach, find another place to order take out food."}
{"text":"The owner was either pretty high or had a pretty short-term memory, which I found funny, as he was messing up the orders for almost everyone.  The pizza tasted good, and the fries were alright, however they lost their crispiness as they were served a little cold.  I haven't tried their hot-dogs or fried chickens, but I'm assuming they're not as tasty as the pizza."}
{"text":"Je n'ai même pas reçu ma livraison et on est maintenant dépassé les heures de fermeture....et bien sûr personne répond...."}
{"text":"This was literally the most disappointing pizza I ever had. The toppings were as minimal and as cheap as you could get. If there were any less, I'd just have microwaved dough in my hand. It was literally 85% crust and feels like it's been waiting in that vitrine for more than 24 hours. The taste was sadly inferior to a 50% off Maxi pizza pocket.  The poutine was small but satisfactory.   The place is somewhat decrepit. While the unique staff member is somewhat stoic, he was quick on the service. The seats are all cracked and worn out and the windows are dirty.  The prices would be fair if not for the abject quality of the pizza.  Obviously, this wouldn't normally warrant a 1 out of 5 as I'm a generous god (300 reference anyone? No? Damn it :( ) but I found a dead fly in my food. Nearly regurgitated the piece of dough I previously consumed.  0/5, do not go there! Worst food joint I ever went to and I was born in Romania in the 90's. So my standards aren't that hard to meet!"}
{"text":"Not very consistant with their food. At times they make one of the tastiest pizza and others just salty, mainly in their sauces. The service is pleasant but the food can be much better and over priced for what you maybe getting."}
{"text":"One of the worst experience ever...  90 minutes to receive our order cold and very bad I have thrown the pizza and I made a sandwich  Thank you Double Pizza you should close down soon as possible"}
{"text":"The rancid stink as you walk in the door will potentially be enough to make you turn right around..   I didn't, and decided to try their cheese pizza again. Maybe if you catch it straight out of three oven it might be better?  Charming bonus feature.. The bathroom stalls were broken down too."}
{"text":"Double pizza is only worth having if you're going to order delivery. Somehow the pizza they have at the shop isn't all that fresh and I can't really say it's particularly memorable.   The neat thing about Double pizza is that they have halal pepperoni. For someone who doesn't eat pork, it's nice to be able to order an all dressed pizza.  Their cheese and sauce is ok, I think the issue I have is with the bread, there's something about it that gives the overall product a slightly cheap feel.  That said, it is cheap, to there's that. Personally I'd pay a few bucks more and get Dominos, unless I'm in the mood for pepperoni, then I'll order Double Pizza."}
{"text":"Was stopped in Montreal waiting for a bus at 3AM and had some time to kill so I wandered off and found this place. Since Ottawa pizza sucks so terribly, I had high hopes that this place wouldn't be disgusting, unfortunately that was not the case. After fighting my way through a crowd of drunks I took a look at their menu, they have what you'd expect from a typical pizza joint but it appears they have quite a few varieties of poutine (perhaps this is standard in Montreal?), I just decided on pizza though. I got 2 slices of cheese pizza since it was fresh out of the oven, the guy who waited on me was extremely polite. +1 star for that!  So I didn't see any dipping sauces, but I wish I had because this had to be the most bland and flavorless pizza I've ever had in my life, definitely on par with Ottawa's. The dough was tough which was weird, every time I would take a bite it required great effort my head flung back a bit, I must have looked ridiculous. The sauce had very little flavor and they weren't overly generous with the cheese... All in all very bland.   Don't worry Montreal! I will not judge your pizza based on a chain restaurant. I'll be there soon for Osheaga and I will post 5 more pizza reviews, hopefully better than this one!"}
{"text":"There's good and bad here, and the pizza is pretty bad. I had a slice of mexican pizza (served cold),  Once they re-heated it. the sauce was way to sweet for a supposedly spicy pizza  The fried chicken however was pretty tasty and crisp.  the fries are an afterthought here. It was freezing inside and pretty grimy, it's much best to take it to go or for delivery"}
{"text":"Yes, I know I have nothing better to do than review a by-the-slice pizza joint, but this could be useful under the circumstances.  Can't remember what it was before, but the funny thing is how dingy and cruddy it was even when they opened about 10 years ago. The clientele ranges from sketchy to boozy, but I love it for it.  The slices are medium in size and they have about 8-10 options on any given day. Most have been sitting there for a while, the hot sauce you can add is definitely required as it adds a bit of zip.  If you order your own pie, it's gonna be much better, trust me on this.  Their menu is pretty varied(they even have their own iPhone app), from chicken wings to subs and even beer. Their fried chicken just sits there for hours, why not fry it when ordered, frying is quick and easy.  They are open late and are the Latin Quarter equivalent of Al-Taib, but their by the slice options have to improve as a couple of places have opened up nearby."}
{"text":"So I went back for pizza (they have a $7.99 large take-out special Mondays and Tuesdays) and unfortunately it wasn't better than the poutine I got last week. The sauce is straight from the salt plant with no hint of tomato or garlic. The hallal pepperoni was tender but also lacked flavour other than salt - though +1 for having the option. I would have liked more pineapple pieces off-center. Service, like last time, was quick and efficient. Plan for access to at least 1L of drinking water after a meal here.  Next time I'm in the mood for pizza I think I'll go to Pharmaprix right across the street instead and get some vastly superior Dr. Oetker from the freezer. Granted, I haven't had pizza chain pizza for a while but I don't remember it being so un-tasty."}
{"text":"Never again. We got two larges, one Hawaiian and one meat,  it cost us $50. I've never paid that much for two pies ever so we expected to be  amazed. The only amazing thing about any of this is that these people have the audacity to serve this. Both were thrown out after a bite of each, this is absolute garbage. It should be called 'Double Price' and they are CHEAP with the toppings. We could literally see the crust through the pizza. Garbage, slim toppings, crust that tasted like paper and the whole thing had a very nasty odor.  A \"proud Quebec product\" indeed. I want my money back, you can keep the vomit sauce."}
{"text":"Love their burgers . Must try it and the service was great and the staff are very welcoming. I didn't have enough change and the guy told me to pay next time. They trust their customers and it meant a lot"}
{"text":"Très bonne pizza a bon prix. Bon rapport qualité prix pour une fête réussie. Je le recommande a tous !"}
{"text":"I agree that you should not waste time trying to order pizza through the Double Pizza website, it will bug out at the end and just consume your time and energy.   But when we called this location the guy on the other end was more than nice, we got the deal price for two medium pizzas which was advertised on the website and way cheaper than other delivery spots we'd looked at, and the veggie pizza extra cooked was totally tasty and good and came quick. It's not life changing pizza, but it's made with lots of local ingredients, tasted fresh and good to us and met our need for so much pizza, stat. Not a bad option at all!!"}
{"text":"This is on of the filthiest restaurants in Montreal. The washrooms, the tables, banquets, garbage, and I can only imagine the back. The price does not meet the quality of the food, the pizza is ordinary and lacks and sort of flavor, the toppings are scarce, I compare my experience eating here to eat slightly sauced cardboard.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The worst!! Ordered their hockey special... The operator told me it would be delivered in 30-40 minutes... 1 hour later still no pizza. I called back to be told that the delivery guy was on his way... 15 minutes later still no pizza... I called the operator again to be told once again the delivery guy was on his way... I  live 10 minute walk from this place... I would have picked it up if I knew. I stated I did not want to pay for an hour +++ late pizza and if it not free then I want to cancel... The operator gave me attitude and hang up on me.... Then an hour and 40mins later the delivery guy finally came. Cancelled order and Send him away. Will never order from here again. What a big waste of time."}
{"text":"I've ordered a pizza(ham, pineapple, black olives) online, got a call from double pizza to confirm the address(not the pizza), received the pizza (only cheese), I call back and I had to wait on the phone 15 minutes when finally I got someone who told me she had to transfer me to a manager, finally the manager said that \"No I didn't order what I'm saying I order and that I confirmed on the phone\" which I did not, he end up saying that I will not be allowed to order from the online service as of now and that he will be sending another pizza.(The pizza never arrived) 2 hours later I end up eating a cold cheese only pizza with my friend."}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza from here late night when in Montreal the person taking the order was helpful we ordered 1 large meat lovers and 1 larges double cheese double pepperoni. Its a pretty large pizza and it was filling. There was tons of meat on the pizza and they werent skimpy on toppings.  We didnt finish the pizzas so we somehow managed to get the box to fit into the tiny mini fridge in our hotel room and a few of of my friends ate it cold and they still said it tasted awesome.   Im not sure why people are complaining maybe people in montreal have a higher pizza standard but this is a pretty average greasy pizza joint.  Delivery was fast and it was affordable it came out to about $8 per person which is an affordable late night dinner when we were too tired and lazy to leave the room to get food."}
{"text":"SUCH good bargains!!! Good delivery, and this is one pizza place that doesn't ridiculously overcharge you for extra toppings. If you take advantage of their delivery packages, which you should, the fries are oddly good, the cake is edible, and stay away from the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Wide selection of pizza for about $2-$3 per slice.  Crust was nice and crunchy, but the cheese/pepperoni/sauce lacked flavor.  It was 2am and I still noticed this, fyi."}
{"text":"This place has pizza that makes me sick and feel barfy. Really Greasy pizza and the crust tastes like cardboard."}
{"text":"Your typical fast food pizza-ish joint. The pizza was pretty decent for a place like that and the poutine was decent as well. The staff was extremely friendly, one of the staff members was even kind enough to run up to the table to make sure the gravy on our poutine was hot enough, even offering to heat it up. Great for what it is, but nothing more."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and quick service. Good prices. All-dressed pizza was delicious but I would have liked to see more toppings! Fries were crispy and mouth-watering. Excellent go-to place for pizza!"}
{"text":"Great bargains on decent sized pizzas and no crazy up charges for extra toppings. Delivery was fast and friendly. We got the 2 for one special. Husband ordered a pepperoni, beef and onion & is very happy. I ordered a chicken & beef and can't get enough. I love dominos but this pizza tastes better."}
{"text":"The worst place ever! Ordered for delivery a poutine and a hot dog. The poutine was so nasty not even cheese curds soggy and cold nastiest poutine on this earth wouldn't even give it to a dog and the hot dogs even worst! Cold sausage under cooked ! Bread not even toasted fkn nasty cold waiste of my money it literly stopped my appetite and it was 15$ for the nastiest meal of my life ! Plleasssseee do not order from here"}
{"text":"Under cooked chicken (thats' plain dangerous), wrong pizza toppings (how do you mess up a 2 topping order???), delivery guy that makes up his own price (rounded up to the next dollar from .15 - this is illegal), broken website with false publicity (double dollars can't be used, ever), non-existent consumer support/help/QA (no answer ever from their email, phone support is rude and no managers are ever available)... this is quite possibly the worst restaurant chain in the world. Avoid at all cost. Starvation is better than this."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service you could ever imagine. If you ever needed evidence that Double Pizza are just in it for the money, simply order / drop by any of their restaurant and be amazed at how they do not give a damn about you.  And if you need more evidence, you can order on their website when the restaurant is closed, and you'll just wait forever for your order to get delivered: no closed noticed or anything.  On the plus site, since you can order from their completely broken website when they're closed, you can totally abuse their fraudulent \"double pizza dollars\". Just place a few orders when they're closed, get the dollars, then use them later.  Shitty restaurant is shitty."}
{"text":"Wrong order, undercooked fries, undercooked and burnt chicken wings...  They can't bother doing an order properly. Don't bother ordering from them.  Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you're ever looking for a reliable pizza delivery late at night, look elsewhere. Avoid placing your order at this business at all costs, even if you think you're generous with your standards for cheap delivered pizza. I've ordered twice from here and the first time involved rude customer service that culminated in a long wait (45+ minutes) for cold subpar pizza. The second time was a nightmarish failed transaction. The operator promised a delivery time of 30-35 minutes. The supervisor extended it to 40 minutes. When the pizza finally arrived over an hour late, the delivery woman was openly hostile and unwilling to abide by the supervisor's directions to give a discount. Angry shouting matches ensued on the phone between her and the supervisor that ended in her taking the pizza and leaving in a huff. I've never witnessed this level of hostility and disregard towards a customer.   Unprofessionalism and incompetency characterize this business. There's not even a significant cost advantage to this place that could ever justify the headache involved in ordering their low-grade pizza. You're better off buying some frozen pizzas."}
{"text":"J'aime bien double pizza la croûte et toujours très croustillante et savoureuse et les aliments frais bonne sauce à pizza excellente service"}
