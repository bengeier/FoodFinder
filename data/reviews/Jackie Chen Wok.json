{"text":"The food was just ok. Quality was not that good but the quantity was great. They need to change there oil it was cheaper then others in the area"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good. I had house lo mien which was wonderful. They provide authentic Chinese food at very good price with high quality. The owner is also very hospitable. I definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. I can't say enough about their fried rice. It's honestly the best I've had from any Chinese restaurant. The staff is always friendly and every item I've ever ordered has been delicious. I've even gotten my mom and grandmother eating here. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. It will do in a pinch, but I probably wouldn't take friends or family there.   Don't expect to dine in. There are maybe two tables. It's definitely carry out. Make sure to call ahead.   If you plan on getting a take-out menu, just take a picture of the laminated one at the counter. The paper copies they give you have been copied so many times that you can't read it.   Also, the parking out front is metered, so grab a bit of change before you head over. I know Shaker Square monitors the meters and they will give you a ticket."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Food at the best prices. Van Akens hidden Jem... As a result of the bad area."}
{"text":"Honestly, I didn't know what to think about this place at first, but for low-key, really affordable Chinese food, it's amazing. The quality is excellent and everything is generally really well done. The service is uncomplicated, though I have only ever gotten take out from here. I wouldn't necessarily plan on eating in the restaurant, but it makes an excellent dinner at home."}
{"text":"My go to greasy Chinese takeout place. The food is cheap, delicious, and super quick! I've yet to order something I didn't like. I'm a vegetarian and they have plenty of options for me. My omnivore husband really enjoys their general tso chicken. This is definitely not an eat in type of place. They only take credit for orders of $10 or more, so bring cash if you're only buying one entree. Only criticism is the place is so dusty which is kinda gross. Still doesn't stop new from enjoying their delicious food!"}
{"text":"My review is solely based on one item on the menu. Their fried rice is to die for.  I get nothing else...  Try it you will love it."}
{"text":"Simple. Fast. In expensive and easy. Located around the back of Shaker Heights. It was a-ok."}
{"text":"Arguably the best takeout in Shaker. It wouldnt survive in NYC where every block has a delivery/ takeout place, but it consistently makes tasty food, which I cant say the same for other places."}
{"text":"I only tried two appetizers - the chicken satay and beef satay - or 'sticks' as they call them.  I regularly get these when i'm in a hurry for something quick from Pearl of the Orient -  and expected similar quality ingredients...fail! Pearl uses chicken breast strips...Jackie Chen uses processed who knows what kind of cut mxi of dark and white meat chicken all congealed onto a stick somehow. They were gross.  The beef sticks had good flavor in terms of the sauce/marinade, but I've had far more tender beef jerky than these rubber on a stick variants.  Pass on this place unless it's the only thing open."}
