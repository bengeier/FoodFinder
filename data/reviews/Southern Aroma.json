{"text":"Amazing Indian restaurant, nice decors and a very friendly staff that explained to us everything on the menu. We tried the chicken masala, the eggplant curry, the tofu chicken curry and the parotta which were all really nice except that the tofu chicken curry was spicer that what they told us. The dessert weren't amazing though, they weren't really tasty and the mango mousse wasn't homemade."}
{"text":"OMG, they don't really have spice level. This place will turn your tongue into fire and your next day won't be pleasant AT ALL!!!! Please make sure you ask for the spice level.  Other than this, food is average."}
{"text":"Strong southern Indian spices, butter ghee laden dishes & super crispy dosas. The calamari, shrimp & gardin dishes are great. Flavors are brought out by pops of lime juice and lots of fresh curry leaves. Had the mutton & asked for it extra spicy; it wasn't very spicy at all but the more we ate the more warm the sensation was. Not as spicy (heat wise) as we wanted/we're used to, but still pretty"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  The head chef and company have really done amazing things with the decor.  The professional staff and welcoming ambiance truly create the perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Got the mutton sukka varaval and kanavai pirtal twice now and both times they were excellent. Service has been excellent both times too."}
{"text":"So I first had food from this place because of their catering. It was delicious!  The salmon was seasoned just right. Spicy and everything tasted fresh. I could tell no corners had been cut in delivering their masterpiece. (Ok i have to admit- my mouth is watering just thinking about that meal...)  I had to try their actual restaurant after this. I was glad I wasn't swayed by the negative reviews. I eat meat but my partner is a vegetarian. This was the perfect combination for us. Their mock chicken (aka gardein chicken) was very good. I'd recommend the gardein chilli chicken to anyone. But before I get to the meal, I'd be amiss in writing this review if I didn't mention the vege rolls and crab cakes. It was served with a sauce that really brought out the flavour of the food. The salad that accompanied the starters was also yummy and had a tangy sauce.  For our actual meal, we had shrimp fry, eggplant curry, putty and the garden chilli chicken. I'd recommend that as a combo to anyone. It was the blend of the traditional and the new.   Maybe the other reviewers had a bad experience, but I'd recommend this place to anyone. The service was amazing without them intruding on date night. Loved it ;-)"}
{"text":"At first i was skeptical about coming here because i didn't expect much from a local place like this. Now the only thing i regret is not coming here sooner. They provide a unique dining experience with delicious south asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Tried the butter chicken dosa. Partially because I wanted to try it and partially because the staff recommended it as a non-spicy dish so I could share with my toddler (personally I like it spicy!).  So it was pretty good.  And something different.  But it was pretty spicy - not sure how they expected a kid to eat that, it was hot for me!  The place is nice, some interesting decor.  Staff was friendly and the food arrived quickly and fresh.  Maybe worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came to this place on a whim. Was really shocked to find out this is a Sri Lankan restaurant. Ordered the cauliflower pakora, mutton sukka varuval, and mango shake. All were really good! The mutton sukka varuval especially was made authentically; tasted like home cooked Sri Lankan food! Really impressed by this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, fabulous job on the interior decorating. Good location with lots of parking. Food was okay. Staff were nice and attentive. Will try again."}
{"text":"A combination of South Indian/Sri Lankan flavours. A restaurant that just opened up around the end of May/ June I wanted to try this food again to see what was new and to try some more dishes. There's definitely more spicy and flavourful items on the menu- with appetizers of crab cakes, sizzling meat dishes, chennai poutine (fries with curry/meat/paneer). This seems to be a new addition. The three of the appetizers we tried were good and flavourful! The shrimp fry (spicy shell-on shrimp) was good.   For vegetarians, the 'mock'soy protein chicken seems pretty good! Amazing flavour and texture--- without the meat.  MUST TRY: shrimp masala, crab cake, kothu roti UPDATE: Dosa is back on the menu!!!  We also tried some of the egg parotta which was nice and flaky. It came with curry sauce.  Maybe a yogurt sauce  would be good too to add there.  In terms of main dishes, the chicken Briyani is delicious and spicy! With a nice chicken piece, egg and a yogurt sauce.   The dessert is good- mango milkshake and offers an assortment of cake, I like the dulce de leche cheesecake- it's a lighter airy cheesecake.  Service and ambience- amazing service from the waitstaff, polite attentive. Seems good for vegetarian and nonvegetarian food.  This place is clean, nicely decorated and fancy. We even got hot towels before the food!   I'm impressed by this restaurant will come here again for my South Indian/ Sri Lankan food fix!"}
{"text":"Love the food!..love all the vegetarian options!!! The server we had was very friendly and helpful ...unfortunately I don't remember her name :( ...going there tonight to show my non vegetarian family how great the food is"}
{"text":"Was looking for some Indian food and decided on this one after some looking around on yelp.  Nice and small place but the decor was very nice. A hand wash station in the back and beautiful mobiles hanging from the ceiling with elephants on them. Everything seemed very traditional and bright.  The food was pretty good. Tried the Chicken Biryani and Deviled Chicken, as well as an appetizer that was vegetarian calamari. All very good, but the app was definitely the best. Great flavor and spiciness! The mains were good portions as well!  The service was quite good, nice uniforms that were traditional garbs and the servers were very nice. Good spot to go if you're interested some nice Indian food!"}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere was beautiful!  I had a mango shake, which was sweet and delicious.  For my entrée, I had the mock chilli chicken with garlic naan. It tasted like real chicken and was very flavourful! The naan was fluffy and yummy as well. The staff were very friendly and provided amazing service.  I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance and good lighting.  We sat down for a party of 4, waited a bit before we got service to order the food. They brought us hot towels to wipe our hands. Otherwise the service was nice and friendly, our waitress brought over napkins and refilled our water.   I've ordered the fish masala, the sauce was nice, but make sure you eat it fast because when the fish gets cold, it's very fishy. The dosa, I find it a bit too sour and soft, the side sauce that went with it were all nice! The butter chicken was pretty good.  The naan, I've ordered 3 garlic and one plain. I like the garlic naan, it makes a huge difference to the flavour. Overall, worth a try. (Solid 3.5 stars)"}
{"text":"Amazing Restaurant for Sri Lankan Tamil dishes.. Amazing Service by Nisha and her crew.! Celebrity Chef Shankar is one of a kind .He is open to customize dishes to adjust the spice levels..This restaurant is unique with thier menu items...Lobster Curry is popular and also Country Organic Chicken curry as well. Recommend make advance reservations as the restaurant gets busy at peak times..."}
{"text":"Amazing! We tried the gardein chicken masala and parotta, gardein chicken kothu roti, gardein fish fry were all amazing. So was the soy chicken biryani it was so flavourful! Absolutely great customer service and we got a free mango lassi for our first time"}
{"text":"Ordered the mutton masala.  Shrimp masala biryani.  Chicken rassam and vegetarian chili paneer.  And garlic naan.  Very delicious and fresh.    Chicken Rasaam was unique and is a must try."}
{"text":"Mutton Biryani is unique and fairly good here, and they offer a solid range of vegetarian (faux meat) options that are actually pretty solid (this is probably because the cuisine style is dominated by curry sauces so the meat texture isn't the highlight). Leans on the pricey end, so the value isn't quite there, but it does have an authentic vibe.  What We Got: cauliflower pakora, gardein (mock) chicken tikka masala, mutton biryani, garlic naan, mango lassi  Restaurant looks better on the inside. All the staff are in traditional dress, and they've got music in the background to match the classy South Asian vibe. Service was a bit slow; we had to ask for spoons and cups after our food came.  The food, in short, was good - but value and service drop it a notch.  It IS an authentic feeling experience though. When I got my mutton biryani, the server had to explain to me that I had to empty the bowl on the banana leaf and spread the spice out. Having said that, \"mild\" was very spicy to me!  The cauliflower pakora consisted of 3 very, very deep fried pieces of cauliflower. They used a ton of breading. For $7, it was an experience... But who pays $2.33 per piece of cauliflower. The sauce it came with was pretty good though.  Garlic naan was also a premium price: $3.29 for four quarters of bread was way overpriced, even if it was tasty.  Gardein chicken tikka masala was good. Recommended for vegetarians looking to see what some of the traditional curry meats taste like!"}
{"text":"The food here was really good. Totally different from other Srilankan restaurants. Their country chicken curry is to die for. Kothu rotti is really good as well. Can't wait to take my family there..!"}
{"text":"New place, classy, tasteful decor - ethnic chic. The masala dosa with fixings was good. They add a small dessert with it which is a unique twist. The quinoa-tofu chicken (mock) based kuthu roti was excellent & so was the quinoa chicken(mock) chilli chicken curry. This place is new & I see it being successful if they continue delivering in the same classy, tasty style. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened but do not get there dosas here; they were some of the poorest we have tried.  Came here on a weekday late evening with a bunch of friends and was fairly impressed with the menu and rating on Yelp. I was just craving dosa and most of us decided to go for it.  I went for a paper roast dosa and was told it was a more crisp version of the regular dosa. Crispy would be better right? Sounds good! Except the texture wasn't right. It was lumpy and wasn't smooth in consistency, while not even being that crisp. It was really oily and felt much heavier than it should have been. Dosas are supposed to be crisp on the outside, light, yet with a soft chew on the inside. My friend who got the butter chicken dosa seemed to also agree that the dosa crepe itself wasn't good. However, I did enjoy their chutneys and the sambar wasn't bad either. And I did like how they have one galub jamun on the tray!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, food not so good. It was cold and flavourless and there was hair in two of the dishes. Went to this place since it was recommended by an Instagram blogger. Reasonably priced but if you're looking for good food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here today to satisfy my Indian food craving. I've been to this restaurant before and the food is usually decent at a reasonable price. We ordered the Kerala shrimp fry, plain dosa, and mutton roti. The shrimp and mutton roti were delicious! They had the right amount of spice and although the bottom was a little soggy, there was so much mutton stuffed in the roti! Those 2 items are a must have when you come here. The plain dosa though was disappointing. I've ordered the masala dosa before and it was good but today's dosa was very soggy, not crispy whatsoever. They were nice enough to substitute the veg stew for an extra tomato chutney, but it was very salty and the coconut chutney tasted like it has been sitting on the shelf for a couple of weeks. I would come back though, just not order the dosas anymore"}
{"text":"Yummy food! They were good about recoiling the calamari when they realize that we thought it was too spicy."}
{"text":"I took my in in-laws from the UK here a few weeks ago and the food and service was fantastic!   We were greeted by friendly wait staff who showed us to our tables.  The cutlery and plates were made of copper and really gave you a feel of a South Indian restaurant.  We were then provided hot towels to wipe our hands, which I don't think I've ever had at an Indian restaurant.  The attention to detail here was something Indian restaurants can learn from as most other places herd you in and herd you out.  The restaurant decor is the best for a sit down Sri Lankan I have seen thus far in Toronto.  The menu had a decent selection of food for both vegetarians and meat eaters.  I am a vegetarian so trying to find well spiced mock dishes are difficult to find, but this place had a great selection.  I would definitely recommend the gardien biryani.    I applaud the culinary vision that push the edges on some of the traditional dishes!   This is the place to be in Toronto if you are looking to try something different from your typical South Indian takeouts!"}
{"text":"My favourite spot as a vegetarian right now: I've tried the Gardein Chicken dishes, Kothu, and stuffed rotis.  Definitely my favourite South Indian restaurant right now, also try the Chennai Poutine!  Great staff and service!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best South Indian restaurant I've been to so far. I love their food, space, and service.  FOOD: The food is so good!! I come here so much cause they cater towards your needs and have a wide range of delicious food. I came here so many times and have ordered different things and have loved them all!  vegetarian biryani - comes with a raita and a rasam like (soup) side to pour into the the food or drink on your own. It does come with an egg but I took it out. This can made to your spice level and I love spicy food so this was very spicy! Usually a restaurant's highest spice level is basically medium- mild cause it's catered to everyone but at southern aroma it really is spicy which really is amazing! It's more than enough for one person!   naan - The naan is soft and fluffy. The garlic naan really makes a difference to its taste! I had the tikka masala and gardien chicken (fake chicken) to go with this. It was delicious!   vegetarian rolls - are filled with a yummy filling made with potatoes and spices. It comes with plum sauce and ranch dressing!  Chennai poutine - is very filling and has curry on top of the fries!   Mango shake- is the best thing ever! Comes with ice cream in the drink.   SERVICE: Amazing service! They seat you as soon as they can and they bring you warm towels to clean your hands. Friendly and helpful staff.   PRICE: Decent pricing for the amount of food you get. Worth it.   SPACE: The space is cultural and traditional but with a modern twist! It's really pretty inside! The utensils and plates are also very nice! The details in the place are amazing. Lots of parking! I do wish it was a bigger restaurant! When it's busy, it does feel crowded and tiny."}
{"text":"Charged $70 for take out. 3 bowls of rice, 3 small bowls of veg curry and some naan. Very mediocre. They forgot to include the pakora we ordered and paid for.  Not recommended. Bland and overpriced."}
{"text":"Finally went here for lunch after hearing about it for months. The waiters were the most cordial I had ever seen. It wasn't crowded when we walked in but go fairly busy as we were sitting down. We ordered the chicken biryani and the mutton sukku dish. I expected the chicken biryani to blow my mind,  as it was recommended to me by countless people. It was good, but I can't say it was the best I've ever had. The mutton dish on the other hand...amazing!!!   You can tell that all of the ingredients that they use are of high quality (they specify that their chicken is organic), and they put the utmost care into food preparation, which I find rare in South Asian restaurants in the suburbs. I really value that. I want to go back and try the poutine :)."}
{"text":"There is a glaring need for a nice classy South Indian/ Sri Lankan place. This place suits the bill. It is clean, has modern decor and has an interesting menu - I've never had mock chicken Kothu roti. The masala dosa was solid with nice sambhar and two chutnies. Interesting twist - dosa had a small dessert gratis. A delicious coconut chocolate truffle. Service was friendly and efficient. I really hope these guys make it."}
{"text":"Craving thali's this past Saturday night, we decided to give Southern Aroma a try in search of variety from our usual go-to thali joint.  Décor is nice. The restaurant appeared very clean.  Staff were friendly and service was ok ( slow at times).  We were disappointed to learn that the Thali dishes were only available during the lunch service ( they should indicate this on the menu).  Instead we went with the chicken biriyani, plain dosa (comes with sambals), eggplant curry, chicken curry.  Everything was delicious.  Food came promptly and presentation was nice ( love the added touch the banana leaves bring as well as the enhanced flavour!).  Portions are large which made for tasty leftovers!  Prices are reasonable and the food is made very well.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My 100th review! Hankering for some South Asian cuisine and this place provided what felt like an authentic experience.  Ambience: The place was so comfy and I loved the music the played. It had a very nice clean feel and the place had very lovely décor.  Staff: The staff was friendly and accommodating when we wanted to split bills. Our server was very soft spoken which made for awkward moments when ordering because we couldn't hear what he was saying and had to ask him to repeat multiple times. The food came at in a reasonable amount of time as well.  Food: I ordered the Crab Cakes to start which were delicious! I just wish they were bigger in portion as they were the size of a doughnut hole. For my main I ordered a Vanni Chicken Varuval with a Plain Naan on the side. It was flavourful and sweet and full of spice as well. It was very spicy (to me), but I loved the taste. Unfortunately, I just wish there were more meat. The chicken were mostly large chunks of bones in each piece and some pieces felt like there was no meat at all. I also prefer more sauce so I could dip my Naan into it but that's a personal preference.  Overall, I think it's a great place to check out! I really want to try one of their seafood curry next time."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant.  Great atmosphere.  Very friendly staff.  Quick service.  Very clean bathroom.  I ordered a pepper chicken and okra tonight.  They were out of both.  I decide to try the butter chicken and a Chana.    The Chana was very delicious and seasoned very nicely.  I ate every single chickpea and loved the hot peppers that were thrown in.  Probably one of the best Chana dishes that I have ever had.  I will go back just because it was that good.  I was not a big fan of the butter chicken though.  It had a very strong flavour that I was not familiar with.  I had take out, so did not finish it.  I eat a lot of Indian food, but could not tell if it was a burned fat taste, or if it was more like an overpowering nutty flour.  I just couldn't place it.  I will go back though.  The staff were fantastic and engaging.  I will go back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant to try various Southern Indian/Sri Lankan dishes.  Kothu roti was good and very spicy :) It's really the only place I know of that serves Sri Lankan food and is not a hole-in-the-wall (not that I mind them, they usually serve the best food)! Prices are decent but obviously you are also paying for the atmosphere as it's a sit-down restaurant. Flavours are great and the atmosphere is cozy. The location is quite inconvenient for me personally, but if I lived closer to the restaurant, I'd visit there again!"}
{"text":"Good service and nice atmosphere.Tried vegetarian Thali.No taste in any of curries and sambar.Everything is tasteless.May be non vegetarian items are tasty.Not sure whether I will go back to try other items again.Don't try veg thali."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday evening around 7 pm and the restaurant was not busy at all.  However the service seems to be quite slow, they must have been understaffed.  We ordered the naan brushetta,  which wasn't anything special in my opinion.  Tasted like cheap store bought naan with processed cheese on top and simple tomato and onion toppings.    The gardein chilli chicken we ordered seemed to definitely be more of a butter chicken,  so I don't know if they got that order wrong.  However,  that was my favourite dish!  It was delicious and the fake chicken tasted pretty legitimate!    The mushroom chettinaad was aright,  quite spicy,  but still pretty good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly a hidden gem. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was welcoming and the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. I will certainly be back and recommend to all.   The reason it did not get rated a perfect 5 if because of the fruit flies, which were an annoyance while dining.   Aside from that, incredible place! Will absolutely be back :)"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for my best friend's birthday. I have nothing bad to say about this place, in fact, it has become my favourite indian food restaurant in GTA. We ordered a mutton curry and chicken tikka masala curry with naan bread and butter naan bread.  The butter naan bread was very good (according to my best friend), and the curries were creamy, spiced, and full of meat!!! The environment is very indian, they played indian music and their cutlery was indian style too. Love it! Service was 10/10, refilled our water frequently.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"We stopped by for Friday dinner ... and the place was packed. But...we found a spot. Our server was very sweet but new , so he had to double check everything for us when we had questions ... The have Thali listed on the menu but not available for dinner which was disappointing ...  Pros: We ordered the Vanjaram fish fry and the Fish Masala + Rice. We also ordered the plain dosa..The food was overall very tasty! Really enjoyed the fish dishes...also surprised with the sweet that came with the Dosa... Ambience is good..and is one of the very few sit down places for Sri-Lankan food which is nice! Cons: The plain rice is not listed on the menu so we were not sure how much they were going to charge us for it.. Also we asked for extra chutney with the Dosa and usually in other places were its extra charge the menu mentions it, that is also missing. In addition the Thali not being available needs to be shown on the menu as well..  Just on a personal note ... since I am used to take out prices for srilankan food the prices seemed pricey... but in reality it is not! Will definitely return"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times so I think I can write an honest review for this restaurant.  Something about me loves Indian food. I especially love butter chicken as the spice level is usually mild. This restaurant makes the best butter chicken in the Scarborough/Markham area!   They put a lot of spices in the sauce so it doesn't taste watered down/bland. I can actually taste the aroma of spices they put in. There were a lot of chicken, so it's definitely worth the price you pay for. I love dipping the buttered naan bread into the butter chicken sauce.   Service was really attentive. My water was refilled a few times without asking."}
{"text":"The food was great!! Sri Lankan and South Indian dishes on the menu. It is a cute little sit down place. I had the parotta and shrimp masala and my friend had the chicken biryani. I would go back just for the parotta!"}
{"text":"Food so good I had to tip the chefs!! Both of em!!  I've tried about 7 different mains here and three different appetizers.   It was a flavour explosion each time and 100% of my brain was excited with each taste. I could have gluttonously eaten 1 dish after the other.  Unlike a lot of Indian and Pakistani restaurants, each curry and dry meat dish tasted vastly different. The dishes  took a while to make but that is because they are carefully cooking it from scratch.  Prices for mains are $11.99 on average.    I highly recommend this place. Its a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The food here was really good and staff were super friendly. Don't order spicy unless you can handle your spice well! Unlike other Indian places, the portions fit the price well and you don't feel like you're getting a small amount for a large price. They have a variety of South Indian dishes from dosas to briyanis to kothu rotis. Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! It's a hidden gem and so cute inside. The cauliflower pakora was my favourite and have been craving ever since. Green dip (coconut I think?) wasn't the best however my friend liked it (to each their own). Desserts were still very frozen when they came out, but besides that everything was good and would go back again for sure !"}
{"text":"I loved my mutton curry! I wish I had gotten a curry with more sauce but all in all it was delicious. I would definitely come back to try more curries and their roti. The service was great and I loved the hot towels given at the beginning."}
{"text":"Pros:  Atmosphere and decor was nice.  Chicken biryani was nice and spicy and not dry. Which was good. Presentation was nice.   Cons:  We had the garlic and butter naan also. It was not an authentic naan. It was the frozen kind. Just warmed up. Was disappointed with that.  Mango lassi was ok. Had better.  We also had Chettinad chicken whicwas big chunky chicken legs. Could have been in smaller pieces. Would have been easier to eat.   Overall I have been to other south Asian restaurants. Had better and more flavorful curries. Kinda disappointed.  I did only try those three items mentioned above. Not sure if anything else is better."}
