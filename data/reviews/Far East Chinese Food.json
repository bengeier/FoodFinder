{"text":"I ordered dinners for my wife and I plus a guest delivered to our suite and everyone one of us thought it was very good. They nissed a couple of items we ordered because the man taking the order by phone was not fluent in English. But what we got was very tasty - and we're all very familiar with Cantonese food."}
{"text":"I asked the fat potato lady for no pork in my Cantonese chow mein. Her response was NO SUBSTITUIONS on there meals. I said I'm not substituting I'm minusing. She started yelling at me like I was a little kid. So I said sorry for asking. Ordered $120 of food for take out. Never went back to pick it up ! SUCKERS!! Place is a dive."}
{"text":"Decided to try this out today. Ordered the cantonese chow mien. I asked for no pork. It wasn't a problem.   The portion was quite big (easily enough for 2)  For the price its pretty good. It is definitely a cheap eats/ value type place.   Definitely a delivery or take out. No real place to sit and it looks sketch."}
