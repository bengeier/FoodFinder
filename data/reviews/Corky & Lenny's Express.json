{"text":"Cleveland Corned Beef is the name at this location. Who knows what happened to Corky's here, it was short lived but I am told by the friendly counter staff that the  people who bought from Goodman's manage/own Cleveland Corned Beef. The corned beef sandwich is outstanding as well as the sides and very affordable along with every other meal including breakfast. Not sure how they do it but I am good with it. The service was fast and friendly at the counter and for those waiting in the line of regulars. The counter makes for a good place to people watch, too."}
{"text":"Very limited menu, unlike the HQ on Chagrin Road.  Just a counter in a very noisy food court in the casino.  Food court was not kept clean, when I visited."}
{"text":"I'll first start with this: if you're expecting the corned beef sandwich you got at Goodman's (which was this exact place) you'll be disappointed. Very disappointed. If you're expecting the quality you got at Cork and Lennys on the Eastside, you'll be marginally disappointed. I was never a huge fan of C&L to begin with but was hoping that they may have just taken over Goodman's and kept it rocking. I was wrong and it may be wrong to have those expectations, but it is what it is.   I had to take a chance to find out, but now that I know I'll never be back. Don't get me wrong, it's not awful, but there are better corned beef places in Cleveland. Slyman's, Tals and Danny's Deli are what I'll stick to."}

{"text":"THREE CORNED BEEF ON RYE !   PICKLES !   TO GO !  The Venerable Duo have recently opened their new \"Express\" version in the former---and quite diminutive---Goodman's Sandwich Inn location.    Though we dropped in two days after St. Paddy's Day---which for them was \"just\" a wee-bit busy (dyed-very-bright-green-tongue-in-cheek)---with a single day of much needed arm resting, nd fore ya knew it---it's Top-o-the-Mundy-Mornin, and back to work all over again stalwartly slicing up more of the good stuff---and we happily brought home three warm heavy bundles.  But there's more . . .     As if by magic !---each single sandwich---that's right---each one---with it's typically-GENEROUS mound of thin-sliced corned loveliness---became TWO !!!   Honest.   I swear !   Before my very eyes !   With the simple addition of two slices of rye---from my own humble provisions---for one bundle, I now had TWO lovely bundles.  And just four more rye slices, and I had a total of SIX !   Six still-VERY-BIG lovely bundles.   Amazing.   Now, it was just two days after the dear saint's celebration day, but something tells me---now hear me out----do you think it's possible?---I know this sounds a wee bit strange---that maybe a  w-a-a-a-y oversleeping leprechaun somehow managed to hitch a ride, then whispered in my ear something like, \"get more bread...get more bread.\"   Funnier things have happened.   .                             Stop in for take-out magic.     With just a few of your own bread slices---it's a FEAST.        Wishing Corky & Lenny & Family the Very Very Best                in their \"hardly new\" flavorsome venture. ."}
