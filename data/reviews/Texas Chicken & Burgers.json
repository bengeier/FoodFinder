{"text":"There's a new kid in town. Huge servings of fabulous fried chicken at a tiny price. I'm a big fried chicken fan and have chased after well reviewed places in search of the best, it lives here."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the fast food world.  The signage on the outside is pretty low key and doesn't represent how good the chicken is.  They use something called ZABIHA Halal chicken.  It's really high quality and it comes through in texture and taste. The coating was crispy and flavourful.  An added bonus ...no MSG.  The french fries were pretty good...I didn't try any other sides.  I'm impressed...and will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one evening after a friend suggested it. I was thoroughly impressed.  The store itself isn't very large and there's very little seating available, but the food is the real deal and the price is great.  I opted for a really spicy burger (the name of which I tragically forget.. Hell Burger or something like that) and I only assumed that it would be marketed \"spicy\" the way Tim Hortons would market it. By that I mean mild at best. Nope. That burger near melted my face off. I was seeing stars by the end of the meal.  I came back not long after and got chicken instead to try it out and it was just as delicious as anything Popeyes or KFC could produce. It was extremely greasy, as is to be expected from a fried chicken joint, but it's nonetheless something that should be stated.  Definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"OMG had the bacon cheese burger and was very pleasantly surprised at how amazing the burger was. Huge servings! I am definitely going back to try all other menu items based on how fresh the ingredients were and how good it all tasted."}
{"text":"Only went inside because it was the only restaurant open at 2am  Stay away from the fried chicken It is too greasy and it tastes like cardboard. You are better out buying something from rabba or the  7-Eleven across the street."}
{"text":"This place needs to learn a little something about customer service. Came in for a chicken combo but they were not working willing to make fries but were willing to serve me cold chicken."}
