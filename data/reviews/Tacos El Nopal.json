{"text":"No just no. The food was way below PAR I ordered the chicken enchiladas thinking it should be a delightful one..It was a big fat NO! Chicken was not cooked and the sauce was so bland I wanted to slap myself for coming to this place. A big let down to cheap and easy mexican food.."}
{"text":"Addressing negative older posts...i am pretty sure that this place is under new management or owners. Solid if not great. Very clean and really good breakfast burritos. Looking forward to lunch the salsa bar is pretty authentic."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican breakfast!!!  Juevos a la mexicana, ranchero, con chorizo, and con Jamon.  Primarily a place for local workers to get lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"The wet burrito was really good! I only wish they put more tortilla chips on my plate. They only put about 6 chips. Also, they were out of agua horchata. That was pretty much of a down fall for me. As for the service... they bring you your food which is a plus. But the lady taking our order answered her personal cell phone while I was ordering. Hmmmm she should've had her full attention on us until we were done ordering."}
{"text":"If you're hungry for lunch and you're one of the many people looking for good, fast, CHEAP Mexican food that ISN'T Roberto's or Don Tortaco, THIS is your place.  I'm not sure why there are negative reviews at all.  The service is always great, the food is always delicious -- specifically the street tacos and sopes with al pastor -- and their selection of fresh salsas is vibrantly spicy (the green stuff) and refreshingly bright (the Pico de Gallo).  I hope more people try this place out, it's become a favorite for our nearby office, and it's always full for lunch!

The only negative things I would say is they often run out of popular items (carne asada, al pastor).  And their tables aren't usually very clean for lunch, simply due to how busy they are and you need to snatch a table as soon as it opens up.  The restaurant itself is really small, so grabbing your food to go isn't a bad idea.  I wouldn't try coming here with a large group."}
{"text":"This was a basic Mexican taco shop. I had a bit of trouble communicating with the Spanish-speaking cashier, but she was very nice and patient with me. The menu was a bit confusing (apparently they don't really have a chile relleno burrito as stated on their menu--it sounded interesting anyway).

My bean and cheese burrito was filling, my special request for cilantro and pico de gallo was amply met, and the price was right. [Note: Roberto's sometimes skimps on the veggies even when paying extra for them.] 

The salsa bar includes carrots with jalapenos, but no cucumbers or radishes. They do, however, have fresh, cut jalapenos at the counter for customers."}
{"text":"Love their tacos!!! The place is clean and the people is friendly. It gets busy at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Want a Mexican plate !! This is the right place to come. In Las Vegas NV . The place is small but clean and friendly. Mexican traditional food. Like Menudo , Caldo de Res , Pozole etc... very close to Vegas strip."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos that the cook Macareno makes are delicious!  And the green salsa is the BEST!!"}
{"text":"I beg you please....please...please don't go here. Unless you enjoy meat that's been cooked to death and you consider grease a condiment.  I use to work down the street from this location and literally swerved across three lanes when I saw that one magical word that gives me a raging hunger hard on every time I see it...TAQUERIA.  I walked in and ordered three tacos. 1 Asada, 1 Pastor, and 1 Lengua.  All were terrible. The lengua had an indescribable funk to it. The asada was good, well that is if you like chewing on a leathery horse dong that's been baking in the senora sun. The pastor sucked and everything was soaking in greasy diarrhea sauce. So if your jonesen for a leathery horse dong soaked in diarrhea sauce you'll love this place, if not you will be severely disappointed. THIS PLACE SUCKS."}
{"text":"Walked in around 5:05pm and the girl tells me we're closed!! I said really the sign says 7-6. She replied with yeah the kitchen stops serving at 5 so they could clean it!! I used to go at least once a week for breakfast not no more."}
{"text":"Good tacos, no horse dong to be found."}
{"text":"I work really close to this restaurant so our office comes here quite often. The food is always really good. Love the breakfast burritos and the taco salad. The green hot sauce is the best. Now the service can be spotty. The last time I tried to call in our office order a woman kept answering the phone in Spanish and I would answer her in English because I don't speak Spanish and she kept hanging up on me. I just kept calling back because it was a little irritating and finally she turned the phone over to someone that could help me. I'm not mad that we speak different languages, that happens, but they shouldn't just hang up on people. Idk. We will keep coming here for the good food anyways!"}
{"text":"UNSANITARY: I FOUND A ROACH IN MY FOOD. 

As soon as I walked in I noticed how dirty the dining room was (signs of dirty kitchen) but proceeded to pick up the food I had ordered over the phone. I totally missed a previous post from a person who experienced the same thing at this very same establishment. This place has a ROACH problem. 

They're food also smelled funny. Wouldn't doubt if they are serving EXPIRED FOOD. 

AVOID THIS FILTHY RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"The other guy's review is a little overly dramatic. This place isn't great, but it's solidly mediocre vs straight up bad. Carne asada is shredded beef not steak. Their al pastor was kind of bland.

We only stopped here because I got furniture from heritage distribution and its in the same building. Would I go back? No, but at least it was clean and fast."}
