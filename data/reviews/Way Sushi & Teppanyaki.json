{"text":"We've eaten here a bunch of times now and the food is always good.  The rolls are decently sized and creative. Good value for money. Its the only place we frequent that actually remembers what I usually drink. 

Granted we're always there on weeknights when its hardly ever really busy but we never had to wait long for our rolls and the service usually is excelllent so I dont know if there has been a change of staff or its just crazy busy during the weekends and that affects service but I dont recognize the issues others have mentioned.

One downside though is that you explicitly have to ask for the happy hour menu. It would be nice if they would just give it to you during happy hour."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, and the sushi seems to be the best thing to get here. This time i opted for Teppanyaki. We ordered the chicken and shrimp, and the filet mignon. The presentation of the teppanyaki chef was very good in the ancient ways of of the teppan chef...
The food was average after preparation. I would have liked the chef to season the chicken better instead of smother it in teriyaki sauce. The shrimp was not bad at all. The filet mignon left a bit to be desired. The cut was not as big as I would have expected, the meat was not as tender as a filet cut should be, and there were some pieces I didn't eat because there was fat on them. The vegetables, rice and meat all sorta blended together and tasted the same. The overall amount was also not as much as I would expect for $20 worth of teppanyaki. Still, the food was good, just not great. 
Also the bathroom needed some cleaning and the urinal needed a toilet doctor to get that bastard flushing again. The staff was very nice and accommodating. 
Next time i will stick with the sushi. I would have been infinitely more satisfied spending $60 on some tasty soosh mcgoosh."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to try this place since we pass by it so often.  One Friday, we decided to try it out for dinner.  When we arrived we were told there was a 30 min wait.  As we waited, we noticed that all the tables that would normally seat 4-6 people, only had 2 people seated.  There were 2 tables available that could seat 2 (we were a party of 4).  

Our wait took longer than 30 minutes, so we decided to sit for Teppanyaki.  This took an additional 30 minutes and when we asked the hostess when it would be our table's turn for the Chef, she said it would be another 50 minutes.  (There were 6 Teppan tables and 2 chefs on a Friday night!)

Needless to say, we left and ate at the Chinese restaurant across the way.  

I don't know if their service this particularly night was out of the norm, but I would prepare would a long wait if you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times and the quality of the sushi is good.   Nothing too innovative or out of the ordinary but hell when your on Gilbert, AZ your just hoping to find fresh fish and Way Sushi delivers.   We've had a party of 9 here and have had no issues with the service. I have never done the Teppan grill as I'm not a fan of the concept, so this review should apply to sushi only."}
{"text":"This is a fairly typical Teppanyaki/Hibachi restaurant.  I didn't have any of the sushi here - so no opinion on that.  The teppanyaki is the usual choice of teriyaki chicken, shrimp, scallops, steak.  The chefs are entertaining with their knife tricks and the onion volcano - pretty much what you'd expect for this kind of restaurant.  The food itself is pretty good.  No, it's not gourmet nor is it unique among other teppanyaki places I've eaten, but it did meet my expectations.

The decor is decent.  It seems like the restaurant isn't too busy - we didn't have a wait at all.  The service was fine for us - prompt with the drink refills and the check.

Would probably go back if I had a craving for teppanyaki."}
{"text":"We have been to Way 5 times now.  3 times we have done the Teppanyaki and 2 times we just went for sushi.  The food is good, and they have amazing happy hour and lunch specials for sushi and drinks. When we have done the teppanyaki, the service can be a little slow.  Each time we spent around 2 hours there.  The normal tables have pretty good service, nothing to complain on there.  

Overall this place has great happy hour/lunch specials and pretty good food.  I will definitely be a repeat customer when looking for a close teppanyaki or sushi place."}
{"text":"Food and service were good but apparently they didn't want to pay the rent. Place is closed, locked up with a sign saying the lien holder has taken over. Guess I have to find a new sushi place now. Damnit."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my experience at Way Sushi & Teppanyaki.  Tasty food, friendly staff & clean what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi.  Staff are always welcoming.  To be remembered and greeted like it after only 1 visit was a big plus for me.  Best no-nonsense sushi in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Everyone is complaining about service. I disagree, for a small restaurant in Gilbert...what do you want? We've all become spoiled with service and we think we deserve people to wait on us hand and foot. C'mon...give me a break. Way Sushi is the best sushi you'll find in the East Valley. No question the fish is the freshest I've ever tasted around here. Way makes Blue Wasabi and Kona look like the WalMart snack bar. Do yourselves a favor and give it a try and don't put the place down because your server didn't pamper you and run around to get you what you wanted immediately. It's great sushi, great people, fun and in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I've been to Way MANY times and have always had great service and awesome sushi. Their prices are very good compared to most of the chains (especially their happy hour prices) and their fish is much fresher than most places I've had sushi at in the past.
I've only had the sushi and some appetizers so I can't rate much of the rest of the menu but from what I have had Way is right up there on the list of my favorites.
Would highly recommend it and will continue to go on a very regular basis!!"}
{"text":"I am very particular about Sushi. We live in Arizona so you better be too.  Luckily, living in Gilbert we have Way Sushi nearby.  They are a small, independent business and do a great job.  The sushi is fresh and priced as to be expected for sushi. My kids LOVE the teppanyaki experience and they still light the food on fire (the chains restaurants do NOT anymore and it just does not feel the same) and put on a show.  The Kirin is cold, the sushi fresh, the teppanyaki tasty and fun.  Better than RA and Kona for sure (quality and price-wise).  Overall, Way is the way to go (haha, I had to do it!).  The ONLY reason they don't get 5 stars is the decor is outdated and could use a sprucing up.  Otherwise, do try them out."}
{"text":"I checked out this place with an Eversave deal. I ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch special. It tasted alright, but I left hungry and ended up getting a salad at McDonald's after I left. There was maybe 3 oz. of chicken on the plate, but I really think it was closer to 2 oz. The rice serving was about 1/2 cup. For around $8 I expected more. I'm glad I didn't pay full price."}
{"text":"Sushi was good but they forgot about the Chicken Katsu that I ordered. I can't remember the last time I left a restraurant hungry."}
{"text":"OK, service does suck.  we waited like an hour or so for sushi, it was crazy.

however, the salmon was incredibly fresh.  not some horrible excuse for salmon you'd get from, oh, say, RA.

horrible service, good sushi..evens out to 3 stars i say."}
{"text":"Went back here with the hubby one night.  Service was AMAZING and the food was great too.  Although we spent more than we wanted to (some of their rolls are just too pricey), I will be back here."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered from here was way too salty! I left the restaurant dehydrated and I found myself drinking loads and loads of water....Their miso soup was terrible...I felt like someone just added 5 cups of salt into that soup.Their sea weed salad was not even fresh...apparently it's been in the freezer and they didn't defrost it all the way so I could feel the little ice chunks and frozen bits of seaweed as I was chewing...just horrible! Ugh..."}
{"text":"I've tried sushi from all over Arizona and this is my favorite place. Most places either teppanyaki or sushi are good but everything here is perfection. The staff is welcoming and helpful in recommendations. I found my favorite roll is the Jamie roll extra spicy and tonight I'm trying the house roll extra spicy. We came here for my birthday to experience the teppanyaki since we have come so many times for sushi and I love the people here. Joe is who I would recommend for this but I am seeing everyone is good. Joe is very entertaining and my daughter loves him and his antics. This place doesn't have a bad thing about it. We come at least once a week."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour just wish the selection was a bit larger. Food quality is excellent - the rolls are good sized and very tasty.

I've never had a problem with the service as a few others have stated. Though, it is never busy one the weekday evenings when I have been there."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are always super friendly and helpful - GREAT sushi!"}
{"text":"Teppan was just okay...had to wait awhile for Teppan chef to come...miso soup was nasty and dressing for salad which I normally love was just okay...sushi order got mixed up and almost got someone else's sushi..."}
{"text":"Love Teppanyaki so I really wanted to love this place but it always seems to be a less than mediocre experience. Expect to wait a long time to see the Chef. Do Not order sushi, it is more headache than i is worth."}
{"text":"I have never been an adventurous girl; I like to keep everything normal with no surprises. Experiencing the sushi and dinner teppan entrees from the Way Sushi and Teppanyaki Restaurant was unforgettable. It opened my boundaries to experience more cultural things. 
The food was very delectable and they had a variety of food assortments to choose from. As a cultural experience I tried to come into contact with everything. I ate three different sushi rolls: Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon Skin, and Crunch. The rolls were fresh and gorgeous with extravagant plate decorations. The food made on the teppayaki grill was also delicious. The chef made the wait very entertaining by making a volcano with the onions and juggling eggs. Their green tea ice cream gave my experience a cherry on top. 
 I recommend this restaurant for anyone open to trying Japanese food in a pleasurable and friendly environment. The staff was very kind and entertaining while providing excellent service. They did not have a huge selection of food but I think it is perfect for amateur sushi eaters. The fish was fresh and the dishes had mouthwatering ingredients that made them original. The prices are also very affordable and the meals are huge. Expect your time at the restaurant to be extraordinary."}
{"text":"We ate here and all 5 of us will never return!! Warm sushi not fresh, cold food and small expensive portions."}
{"text":"Love the rolls. Have to try the tepan soon."}
{"text":"not normally in this area but was looking for some teppanyaki.

all the reviews here talked about the service, not the food. so i thought i would check it out anyways.

literally the worst teppan restaurant i have been to.

first impressions . . . the table was all sticky and the corner was taped together but the tape came unstuck so this piece of table was just hanging off. 

the shrimp appetizers were overcooked and chewy. there were a couple filets and strip steaks ordered. i ordered the filet and when he served me, he gave me the skinny little steak that i thought was the strip while cooking. after comparison taste testing, the filets were the thin little steaks (maybe 3 oz.?) and the strips were the nice looking ones.

also, biggest complaint of the meal . . . the fried rice. the chef didnt start cooking it until after we were almost done eating the rest of the meal (meat and veggies). i like to eat rice WITH the meal, not get a pile of it at the end. there were hardly any veggies in the rice, and no chicken, just eggs. also, most of the rice was still crunchy and not fully cooked.

the mustard sauce (and i guess ginger too) is one of the best parts of the meal. their sauces just plain lacked flavor.

i did like the scallops though. but they were kinda cold by the time i even got veggies to eat with them (not to mention no rice!)"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS!!! 

The service is horrendous. 

We waited 40 minutes for our food. Another party arrived, ordered, ate and paid before we got anything. The food finally came and two of the dishes weren't what we ordered. 

Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"The Teppanyaki grill is the only good part it taste much better than others but the service is bad and I once found what looked like plastic shards maybe fish bones in my sushi rolls yuk"}
{"text":"So everyone - I am upgrading my review of this place to 5 STARS...wish I could give it more.

I go there about twice a month.   The food is good the service is good - neither are the best I've ever had, but there is something very special about this place.  Everyone that works there is fun & friendly.  They are GREAT with kids and will do pretty much anything you ask.  This is why we keep going back AND tonight was our best experience yet....

My 7-year old loves sushi and always asks to go to \"Way\" for the reasons mentioned above.  We sit in the same seats at the bar EVERY time.  Tonight, he said that he wants to be a sushi chef when he grows up.  He mentioned this to Peter (who I've never met before at this restaurant).  He went out of his way to give my son special tips on how to make sushi.   Thank you Peter!  We had so much fun and the food was great!  We will keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Came in to order take out. She said sure & walked away. Took forever to get my order & they weren't busy.  But another customer had gone up to the sushi bar to say they were missing 4 orders of sushi so maybe they got mine?  Then I get home and discover I have vegetable instead of shrimp tempura. Rolls were small and mostly filling, hardly any fish."}
{"text":"Went there a few times over the past couple years. First time was pretty good, but since then its gone down hill."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight with visiting family. Needless to say, I was embarrassed. We started with sushi which our order was messed up. We ordered some rolls and one of them was a salmon skin roll. Well, we were served a spicy salmon roll. We pointed it out to our server and asked her if we could please have the salmon skin roll. She proceeded to look through the white wipe off sushi menus, spoke to the sushi chef, and came back to us and asked if we wanted the chef to make us a salmon skin roll or if we would eat the spicy salmon roll. We just said we would eat the roll that was in front of us. If they had proper customer service, they would have made the salmon skin roll and brought it out regardless. The ginger was a very small amount and rather soggy. For having eaten at many authentic Japanese restaurants across the country and around the world, I suggest you go down the street to Kona Grill for sushi. The prices for the \"special rolls\" are a lot cheaper and they are a lot better quality wise too. That could be because it is a chain and they have standard and quality control to live up to as well as good customer service...this is just compared to the location from one to another. Less than one mile, I'd drive to Kona and pass this by and not waste your time and money.

Our entrees arrived and all of them were salty. Even my fried rice was salty. If this chef were to go and work at an old folk's home, they would be out of business within a week. All of their clients would probably kick off because of the high sodium! 

When it came time to pay, the bill arrived in a black padded pouch with American Express embossed on the outside. Well, don't bother trying to pay with American Express because they don't take it! Oh yes, they did charge us for the spicy salmon roll. It wasn't worth bringing up again. She didn't seem to care in the first place. We just aren't going back."}
