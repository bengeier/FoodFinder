{"text":"We stopped in last night because the architecture caught our eye. We ended up grabbing delicate and delicious drinks at the bar; the Winter Mojito is fabulous as is their refreshing Flowering Cucumber. We didn't stay for dinner (as we were craving pizza) but we will be back!

We spoke with the hostess (and owner, perhaps?) and she said that the resto is eco-inspired, with hearty recycled wood adorning the clean gallery lines. It's a very inspirational space, but doesn't feel haughty. Thanks for a welcoming experience, Boehmer!"}
{"text":"Were seated quickly enough i suppose. Took about 15 minutes for our order to be taken (drinks to start). We ordered the cheese/ meat plate ($70). Waited a solid 40 minutes for that, as if it takes that long to put cold cheeses and meats on a plate. I was most excited for the proscuitto and instead they substituted for some fatty meat that neither of us were willing to eat. Also served something that looked like meatloaf...we weren't even willing to try that....if i wanted meatloaf i would...well no, i wouldnt. The cheeses served were brie, blue cheese and something sharp that just tasted like an american cheese. So that was boring. It was served with bread crisps so we ordered bread....was served cold. There were also no olives of this said charcuterie- instead some odd, flavorless lima bean- type salad/ ceviche. Top it all off there was a honey drizzle across the board. Pretty sure the french aren't fond of sweet meats....being russian neither am i. Especially considering it kept getting on my hands. I also ordered mussels along with the plate. Half way through the plate i realized they hadn't been brought out and i asked the waiter. He admitted the kitchen forgot and they brought me free ones....twenty minutes later. I can't say the service was bad because our waiter was actually very sweet and apologetic. Kitchen, on the other hand, which the owner was working that night is \"one star\" to say the least. Very disappointed. Should have just gone to the ice cream cookie sandwich place next door. The twenty person line up of stoners would have been quicker."}
{"text":"Total let down. To be clear, I'm not the pickiest and leave a lot of room for error but this was a wholly underwhelming experience. 

To their credit, when we offered our honest experience of our dining experience, the staff and chef went above and beyond to make things right. 

Uninspired, bland, tired entrees at $40 on the Ossington strip just won't work for a restaurant. There are a dozen better options at half the price less than a block away. To be clear, it's not about the sticker price, but if your price point is set that high in this area then you're promising a unique dining experience. This was completely banal. I have literally eaten better steaks at diners. I have never had chewy duck before this night. Portion size was small and sides were boring and improperly prepared (chip truck fries and rock hard carrots). 

The decor, while very beautiful and austere, creates a stark, cafeteria like room. Concrete floors and white walls makes for the antithesis of intimacy and yelling at the table to be heard (though the ambiance did improve when the lights were lowered). The odd selection of common office plants - all  dying - puzzled me in a place featuring high end designer furniture.

Service was very kind for sure but also very slow and the kitchen was slow as well (again, puzzling as the restaurant was far from full).   

I would love to see this restaurant come together and bring its A game. I hope Boehmer goes for dinner at Frank's kitchen, The Woodlot, Foxley's and Enoteca to see what the competition is executing so well for so much less. Unless they step up their game I fear Boehmer won't be around for long. The clientele seemed very 905, grey haired old money carry over from the Rosewater. That will only last so long. 

Locals aren't impressed and that will sink the business."}
{"text":"Tuesday's: Buck-a-Shuck, $22 lobster, 1/2 price bottles of wine. You really can't go wrong here. Great atmosphere and our server was genuine."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. 
Great service, excellent food and all happening in a beautiful, cool space. 
We were at the restaurant on a Wednesday evening, which meant it was less busy than usual, but it felt like service was of prime importance, regardless. 
Would definitely go back and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Boehmer. I know a lot can be said about the general attitude with which one visits any place -I was in good spirits (half a star built in to this review). We supped on liquids and many of the small plates -everything was exquisite - oysters, harvest platter (Ontario Stilton), pan roasted quail, house made sausage, house made rillettes and the pork belly and kale salad. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. I would definitely visit again and recommend."}
{"text":"Was here for a work dinner so i didn't pay. Not worth the money in general. Bland main, and the only highlight was desert. Plenty of better places to go to in this ossington strip."}
{"text":"Well designed bar with gorgeous finishings. We were sat at the back toward the kitchen which was a bit too quiet for me - there were a couple of empty tables around which took away from the potential that this restaurant has. Further toward the bar and at the front of the restaurant would have been ideal. That's a personal preference of mine as I like to be \"in it\" experiencing the ambiance, rather than removed.  We were next to the gorgeous motorcycle though, which was fun for a few pics! Service was a little slow - I had to ask twice to see where my martini was at, which took 20 minutes to arrive.  Desserts (cheesecake, cookies, apple pie) were all delicious. The espresso martini to accompany was well made (despite the delay). 

This restaurant would be better (more intimate) if it was half the size."}
{"text":"A great space filled with cool design. Service is excellent and cocktails delicious. A must are Tuesday's when the place is a bargain with $22 lobster, busk a shuck and half price bottles. But go as I do often. The food is wicked. Must have sticky ribs, killer foie and out of bound desserts. My personal fav is his Bison Ribeye."}
{"text":"My roomie and I had walked by this place on many occasion, always pointing out to one another how beautiful a space it was and that we should try it. It wasn't until a friend of mine told me about their insane Tuesday deal that I phoned on up to make myself a reservation. 

My experience is solely based on Boehmer's Tuesday buck-a-shuck and half priced bottles of wine night- but who doesn't love a deal on such delectable treats?! 

If I was to die tomorrow, you would find me in the vintages section of the LCBO drinking the place dry. On an average day, however, I love to find a beautiful bottle of wine that also has a beautiful price tag to accompany it. So when I found out that Boehmer offers half price on ALL their bottles on Tuesday... you better believe I was jumping on the bandwagon. 

So for all you oyster and wine lovers- I suggest you hit this place up on Tuesday. 

My only reservation with the place was that sometimes we had a hard time getting our server's attention. While I understand that the place was packed, perhaps there needed to be more support staff to clear plates more efficiently etc. Hopefully these little quirks get worked out as the restaurant adapts."}
{"text":"Meh....

The vibe is good here but the food isn't creative at all. I ordered their scallop/lobster main...what I got was a bed of boiled spinach with four scallops on top, a sad little lobster claw on top all slathered with coconut curry sauce. For 31$....

We were chatting with the table next to us, they had ordered the lobster special (whole lobster for 22$) and said it was overcooked. I mean really? All it takes is 7 mins in the pot. General fail on the lobster front it seems as our lobster Mac n cheese was overly gooey, was a random mix of pasta that didn't go well together, and we really couldn't taste the lobster because of the strong cheese they used. 

As for the staff, they are well meaning but I think not very well trained. Our server was quite friendly, there was just a bit of a lack of polish you'd expect when they're charging up to 40$ a plate.

Upside is half price wine on Tuesdays, I would go back for this only and some appetizers."}
{"text":"Boehmer has a lot of good food experiences going for them - the lobster dinner deal was great - not sure if they're still doing it - but basically a full lobster for $15.  Excellent price, and a solid size.

This is what is unfortunate: the $5 pints were available at the bar, but not at the table while you're eating? Explain to me how that can help a business operate when most of the seats are empty on an early Tuesday night?

I had one pint at $7 or $8, but declined a 2nd.  You lost $3 from me, rather than offer my table the (hardly) discounted pints 10 FEET AWAY FROM THE BAR!


Beautiful interior, great big windows to people-watch on Ossington, and a fantastic menu - will be back either for drinks at the bar, or perhaps soberly, for dinner."}
{"text":"Just WoW!! It was a whole delicious dance in my mouth!! From start to finish!! Just do yourself a favour and go there now!!"}
{"text":"Love the decor, the food is great, and the service could be better. Came here for dinner with some friends, and it was good. I used to come here quite often after work during their happy hour (happy prices!!) for some seafood and wine with some colleagues at least twice a week. Not sure if they still have it, but i'll soon find out when i'm there next month."}
{"text":"Food took over 1.5 hours to come. Rude manager. Snobby server. Will not return."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and the food was outstanding.

Our meal consisted of the following:

grilled calamari with heirloom tomatoes
the beet short rib
flat iron steak
side order of brussels sprouts

The grilled calamari and heirloom tomatoes were so good, love the grill flavour on calamari!

The short rib was fall off the bone and super tender, it came with some veggies and purees and everything on the plate was so good. Its sauced in a chorizo sausage flavour and its by far one of the best sauces I have ever tasted.

The flat iron steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and came with some veggies and a few frites.

the side order of brussels sprouts was also delicious and a nice add on.

I like the rustic, lofty feel of the restaurant. Its simplistic, cozy and rustic all at once. The ambiance is good with a nice crowd and good music.

They have an extensive wine and drink menu but get ready to be gauged in this department. They charge significantly more her for a bottle of same caliber elsewhere.

I will most definitely be coming back to try the other items on the menu. We could over hear the conversations around us and everyone seemed to love their meal."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of friends. The decoration was nice, though I wasn't a fan of the pictures on the wall. The ambience was OK, nothing special. It was a bit empty, but at least unlike some other restaurants, it had a high ceiling and the music was low, meaning we could actually hold conversations and hear one another.

Our server was very nice and polite. Price wise, it's on the up-side: $30-$50 per entree, and $10-$25 for app. To be fair, the portions are rather large. The appetizers took a long while to come, maybe a good 30-40 minutes. We ordered a $60 wine that was nothing special at all, and even though it was under full-bodied, it was sweet and light. The grilled calamari was delicious though, and my friend raved about the tomato and mozzarella salad. 

The entrees came pretty quick after the apps. Most of us got the hanger steak. The medium-rare was done to perfection, and the meat tasted really good. But the cut is tough and chewy. I'm not a fan of The Keg, but I'd rather have their $30 steak than this. A friend got the chicken... i think it was a chicken leg, and she wasn't too impressed (her fault for getting chicken... who gets chicken? :P ). Another got the cod. It looked good but I don't remember the feedback.

We skipped dessert as we had plans elsewhere. Oh, and they were out of oysters. Overall, very 'meh' for $75/person, and it would've probably been very 'meh' overall for $90-$100 had they had oysters and we had ordered desserts.

So pros:
* Staff were nice
* Grilled calamari was pretty yum
* Hanger steak tasted really good and was cooked perfectly

Cons:
* Ambience was bland
* Appetizers took a long while to come
* Hanger steak was a really, really tough cut
* Our wine was subpar. 

Overall, not worth the $, I'm afraid, at least with the items we ordered. Perhaps the scallops or something else would be better."}
{"text":"This review is starting with the most important thing first: Beef Cheeks. I don't know where this amazing cut of meat has been all my life, but I have been on a cheek mission for the last year.... and can say without a shred of doubt that these are the best cheeks I have eaten. There was no chewing necessary; a sign of a perfectly cooked cut in my opinion. And as part of a Winterlicious menu, that's a bold statement. Tender, giant portions with a horseradish mash were quite surprising given the usual peasant treatment I have experienced on Winterlicious menus.  I would have loved to have more of the red cabbage and mash though, why skimp on such a perfect threesome with beef?

Cocktails, roasted beet salad, artic char and smoked salmon were Amazing, don't get me wrong, but they fall slightly behind the entree in terms of impact (and obviously chewing was required for these). 

We also had exceptional service. I was nervous about this. Given the mixed reviews on here, plus winterlicious treatment, I had my expectations set low. Our server was very knowledgeable, filled the water up without even knowing she was there, super polite attitude and checked in after each course. I also couldn't help staring at the massive teak chandeliers. Such an eye catching establishment.

We will be back. My bet is this place is even better in the summer."}
{"text":"No, still does not do it for me. 

The bartenders have to mount the bar in order to reach certain liquors which is not cool. This made me realize how the entire architecture is not thought through all that well, giving the place a bit of a cold feel. Like what you would get if you were to convert a long and narrow former garage into a restaurant, but inadvertently still retain the garage-y feel. And I can't relax and eat in a garage, never have been able to. And no, 50 Wishbone chairs won't make the place posh or sophisticated if paired with cheap tables."}
{"text":"3/5! Great food and ambiance but overpriced for what you get. I had a martini & ordered the rack of lamb for my main. I truly enjoyed both but I found it expensive relative to other places on Ossington. I would not necessarily go again, but its worth a try."}
{"text":"I passed by this restaurant and decided to try. The maitre gave me a face. straight and no smile. We were seated at the back of the restaurant. Lamb and duck were stinky. Smells like blood. They should be able to cook better than that if they have ever cooked before in their entire life. After finishing the dish, I wanted to run one block north to the Golden Turtle for a refresh of my tongue. Just clean the soiled mouth. The picture hanging on the wall is a forest with garbages around. What kind of decoration is that? The frame of the picture must be more expensive than the actual picture.
The best thing in this restaurant was the desert. It was awesome. I feel sorry for this patissier who works at this restaurant to follow such a bad dishes...

Seriously, don't go here if you don't want to waste your money and time.

The one star is for the DESSERT. I want to give minus star if for the main course."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, atmosphere good for large groups.  Service is abysmal at best. our most recent experience with a small group was so inadequate that we won't go back with a small group."}
{"text":"The trendy Ossington strip is home to many of my favourite restaurants including Foxley, Delux, Pizza Libretto and now Bohmers.  This 5000 sq feet old open gallery-esque space is the newest project for chef Paul Bohmer formerly of the Rosewater Supper club.  It has taken the chef/owner over a year for this project to become a reality as he was the last to put in his application for a liquor licence application to the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario before the Ossington bylaw to ban the development of new bars/restos was put in place.
The restaurant's modern decor from it's gorgeous antler inspired chandeliers with sparking Swarovski crystals dripping from them and a large communal table in the central area to smaller nooks where original paintings from Bohmer's late father hang as a tribute and a private dining area off to the back are things of pure beauty.The menu is focused on local fare and our waitress told us that our seasonal vegetable of the evening would be fiddleheads as they are in season.  What funny veggies they are!
Delish meal, loud place, good for group"}
{"text":"This place could be great. The decor is beautiful, the ambience lively and inviting, and maybe if we gave it another chance, we'd get to enjoy some of that - but that's not what happened.

Despite friendly service, it took 1 hour for our soup to come. And then it took another hour for our mains...and when they came, the three orders of the halibut were overcooked and tepid. Not worth the wait or the price. Apparently the lamb was excellent.

Yes, there were apologies and we were comped some wine, but in the end, I still had a $250 ( for 4) bill to pay.... so I will not go back."}
{"text":"This is going to be a 3 Part Review:

Service: Spectacular, the hostess was very accommodating even when we were running late for our reservation (granted it was a Monday Night) and when we showed up we were greeted with a warm smile, had our jackets hung up and shown to our table. Our sever was equally impressive breaking all the norms and actually making an effort to have a real conversation. He was always attentive, not overly which I hate as well, and made sure we had a pleasant dining experience.

Atmosphere: Very modern chic, the restaurant is carved out of what looks to be an old warehouse and the kitchen is openly exposed with high ceilings and a lot of modern décor to lighten up the place. A lot of space, overall just a very open restaurant with a relaxed and no pretentious vibe.

Food: Solid, the menu supposedly changes periodically to cater to what's fresh and grown locally. On our night we tried the Venison Tartar as an appy, entrees we had the Sea Scallops, Bison Strip Loin, and a side of the lobster potato puree. Dessert we had the Vanilla Crème Brule. My only negative comment about the food was the sea scallops where we found it to be a bit salty and the scallops itself a bit sandy. At one point I think I ate a whole chunk of sea salt. Only one negative comment but overall the food was solid and the dessert was phenomenally executed. 

This is a great restaurant for drinks or dinner and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hello, Ossington... I'm back. It's been a while. I see you've acquired some more urban hipster citizens. Haven't you reached capacity yet? That said, I gather you have a relatively new addition to the neighbourhood: Boehmer. With all of that lovely wood throughout the restaurant it certainly looks promising.

If you're looking for great preparations and an interesting room - not to a mention a dose of people watching - this is the spot.  I started with the venison tartar, which was good (not great); however, the greens that came with it were superb. 

My main course was one of the best plates of goodness I can recall consuming in recent memory. Rabbit saddle, stuffed with blood sausage, wrapped in bacon and then served on top of some blanched brussel sprouts tossed with roasted hazel nuts. Would I eat this every night if I could? Probably not. Would I suggest that you definitely consider breaking your \"no bunnies for dinner\" rule in the name of this dish? Absolutely. I would actually recommend going to Boehmer just to have this dish - although I gather the menu turns over with the seasons. 

Capped off the evening with the profiteroles, which were good; but I thought the filling they used was Chapman's ice cream (note: there is a time and place for Chapman's, but it doesn't involve a $10 desert at a restaurant). 

Overall, service was good. We were given an extra 45 minutes grace on our reservation window before we were asked to vacate - there are two sittings and we'd paid the bill, so it really was time for us to leave.

My only real criticisms of Boehmer are the bar and the wine list. 

One of my guests ordered a greyhound, but they didn't have grapefruit juice available. I found this hard to believe at the time and am having an even harder time with it now that I see some of the other posts alluding to this place as having an above-average bar (it doesn't).  However, instead of Pabst Blue Ribbon, they do have Victoria gin on the menu. Definitely a step in the right direction.

I thought the wine list was nothing to write home about. Simply OK (not enough of my preferred Ontario whites). Furthermore, some of the new world stuff on the list - e.g., the Kistler Pinot Noir - was marked up 15% beyond what I have seen it for at other restaurants in the city.

I'll definitely be back at some point before the end of the summer to give this place another go. If you go to Boehmer, I hope you enjoy it too."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very classy and elegant but not intimidating. Food is beyond belief and it's really cool seeing owner/chef Boehmer cooking up a storm in the open kitchen."}
{"text":"overall this resto was a positive experience.  the food is ok, not overly delicious, but not overly bad either.  generally, things tend to be overcooked.  the service is good.  the real enjoyment, however, is the decor;  the art, lighting, and furniture aren't bad either. 

people-watching here is an eclectic mix of middle-aged hipsters, hot young professionals, and the geriatric chic.  we spotted the face of fashion television doing what seemed to be an interview in the long aclove on the right: she didn't eat a thing."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times on a Tuesday for the buck a shuck - sat at the bar once and at a table with a group twice - and the staff is delightful. Easy camaraderie and they truly pay attention. The oysters are goddamn delightful, the lobster mac and cheese - delightful. Wine selection - delightful. Lobster, brussel sprouts with pancetta - delightful. Basically it's the bees knees in a hood I love to hang out in so #winning. High fives everyone."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it here. But: they are insanely loud. Louder than Libretto! No insulating surface on the ceiling, or anything -- my friend and me had to scream at each other all dinner, and eventually went to Lakeview for dessert. Drinks: great. (Vivek, you were right about the ginger cocktail!). Venison tartare: great! The famous mushroom chicken (or, fowl, as they call it) -- and now it comes -- was a real bummer. It was utterly undercooked and bloody and as if it was not enough, waaay too salty. Like, 200 grams of salt. (And I already feel bad for using too much salt). That for 27$, comrades. So we wrapped it up, tipped the pretty hatcheck girl, and went to have 5$ sundae at Lakeview."}
{"text":"Had the Foie Gras and the Kobe Beef Cheek - food was very good, service was attentive. Pricey wine list. All in all a good spot for a Friday night dinner."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a few friends on a Tuesday night when wine bottles and (I think) also lobster was half price, as well as $1 oysters. The wines were fantastic, and the service was great. The servers were quit knowledgeable regarding their wine list and helped us pick 4 different bottles all together, two of which were sparkling and went really well with appetizer oysters. I have had better oysters, but for $1 these were fantastic. We also ordered grilled calamari and for dinner we all had lobster. Everything was tasty and fresh. I would have loved less noise, but the place is busy so what can you do? :)

Make sure you book in advance specially if you are going on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Music was so loud my friends and I could not hear ourselves or the server.  The manager poured wine in our glasses splashing everywhere and gave us attitude when asked about the specials.  The saving grace is the decor and atmosphere but not enough to ever return again.  Food was overpriced and average to say the least."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Space was nice. Service - not great. Price- about 30% too high.

Sat at the bar and had some veal cheeks on mashed potatoes. My comrade had the salmon with lobster bisque on risotto. Both thought our meals were 3/5s in terms of enjoyability. Good - but nothing worth returning for $30+ a main. 

Beers: they ONLY have Creemore. Huh?"}
{"text":"Pretentious servers, awkward setup/design, mediocre cooking combined with terrible presentation however the wine was good"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice, and loved both occasions.  The first was quite funny, as I watched my vegetarian friend's  face contort as I ordered the bacon-wrapped, blood sausage filled, rabbit dish. It was incredible! These friends were visiting from San Fran and were really impressed.  The second meal was more of a romantic dinner and the service, food, and cocktails were all superb. Sure, it's a bit noisy (think it used to be a garage?) but it's worth your time."}
{"text":"Went last night, and it was amazing. The ambiance was fantastic, and staff was very professional. We spent several hours there, and time just seemed to fly bye. 

I was quite hungover from the previous night, so I decided to get a caesar, and it had to be one of the best caesars I've ever had. The spices in it were amazing, and they also added horseradish, which definitely put it over the top. 5/5

We decided to get the lobster mac and cheese to start because we already had the bread, and we knew the mains would be filling, but still wanted to get a taste. It was pretty fantastic. Generous chunks of lobster, and they actually used orzo pasta as opposed to the macaroni, but it worked quite well with the dish. It wasn't as cheesy as I may have liked, but more cream based sauce. Overall: 4/5

I then got the rack of lamb cooked medium rare. Id say it was cooked closer to the rare side, but I was completely fine with it because it was incredibly tender and didn't have any hint of gamey flavours--not even the fat surrounding it. The barley risotto and the vegetables in the plate were also delicious. Overall: 4.5/5

My friends got the hanger steak cooked medium rare. Comparing it to my lamb, it seemed a bit tough, but thats quite possibly because my lamb was so darn tender. I wouldn't suggest getting it cooked any more than medium rare. The fries were cut nice and thick, and the tender skin absorbed the jus nicely. Overall: 4/5

We decided to end off the meal with a shared 12oz french press coffee and the \"cheesecake, my way\". The cheesecake was nice and airy, which was actually kind of a nice surprise after such a filling meal. Overall: 4/5

I would most definitely come back, whether it be for a night out with friends, or a romantic evening with a significant other. I would suggest this place to anyone, for any kind of social setting, and for any age range."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed on so many levels. We had to return 2 dishes due to a bitter burnt taste on our octopus and steak. I think one of their grills needs cleaning. As participants of the Babylicious program they should know that time is of the essence when it comes to little ones. First we waited 20 minutes for our 3 bowls of puffs for the kids (all they needed to do was scoop it out into the bowls - no cooking required. Then we waited 40+ minutes for the appetizers. And then another 30 minutes after we had finished the appetizers. Considering most of our food was seared and not baked and the restaurant was not full - I don't see a good reason for the delay.  Not having enough cups and cutlery should have been noticed by the waiter. The only thing they did well in terms of service was the water.  Our cups were refilled regularly. 

For the price we paid  (we didn't do the prix fix) I expect a kitchen and front of house staff that runs much more efficiently and effectively.  Everyone needs retraining."}
{"text":"great food, ambiance, and service. I'm always pleasantly surprised by the number of decent restaurants along Ossington."}
{"text":"one saving grace

Cracker and I couldn't decide between Union, Delux, and Boehmer.  The latter won simply because it was the only one both Cracker and I hadn't tried.
 
Long story short: Boehmer's service failed at every instance.  But the delicious entrees saved it enough to make it blogworthy.  In fact, it's the reason it gets a 3, not a 1.

Want the short story long?  Read on.

Service was clearly a reflection of inexperienced staff.  That's good for the restaurant because it's fix-able with some direction and constructive criticism.  Our  particular server failed to take away the wine glass from our very cramped table when I said I wasn't drinking. We selected our three choices for the Harvest Menu only to be told that our item was no longer available.  We finished ordering only to have her return five minutes later to tell us one of the mains was no longer available.  Advising the customer that a menu item is no longer available post-decision is bad service. It should not happen -- much less twice.  Adding insult to injury, the food took longer than necessary.

I was hangry by the time the Harvest Plate arrived, but that didn't influence how I felt about it.  It was elementary - nothing spectacular about it.  Had they had our original choices, I might be singing a different tune.

But again, in the end, the mains were good enough to raise Boehmer above the above:

BC Black Cod $29 - creamy and delicate.
Grilled Hangar Steak $26 - well seasoned, perfectly cooked and surprisingly easy to chew.
The lobster mash, though a touch too salty, was really decadent and the kale was amazing.

I would go back, but only if Union and Delux are both full."}
{"text":"We've been here a bunch of times, all times the whole experience was on point. 
The food is beautiful. But what's equally as important is the great setting it's served in. They've done a great job with the interior. 
Fairly kid friendly. Do try!"}
{"text":"I went here on Sat night. I suggest making a reservation as it filled up by 8:30 pm. 

I love the ambience, and how spacious it is. 
The service was a bit on the slow side, they seemed understaffed. The food was very good.

We had:

venison tartar- 4/5 a bit gamey, I loved that there were capers in it.

House baked bread 2/5 it wasn't warm. Nothing special.

Black cod- 5/5 this was delicious. Beautifully cooked, with just the right amount of veggies and sauce. 

Bison ribeye- 4/5 this was a huge piece of meat, but it wasn't the greatest piece of meat. It was extremely fatty. Other than that, it was soft and tender and well seasoned. 

For desert we had what was called the New York style cheesecake, but it wasn't a NY cheese cake at all. It tasted like the cheese had been whipped. Our server said they would correct the menu. I hope they did. 2/5

I will definitely return to Boehmer. My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Don't much care for their lineup of unique cocktails. 

For some perspective I love Bar Chef, enjoy County General a lot and find the Cocktail Bar to be pretty good. 

But the cocktails here are just full of pretentious ingredients for little to no added value.

Ambiance though is really great... Fun place, just never really feel at home here."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant Saturday with a date, we were both unimpressed with the quality of the food.

We shared the octapus appetizer, we both felt it was cooked well but lacked flavor.

Next she had the beef short rib, the meat was obviously overcooked, most likely to cover for the poor quality of the meat. Almost half of what she got ended up going back to the trash because it was all fat.

I had the scallops and prawns, now I have been to a number of established restaurants and never in my life would I think 5 scallops and 2 prawns (to one sized) would cost 35$. I thought well if it's the best damn scallops I have ever eaten then I guess it's worth it... unfortunately these too were over cooked.

The saving grace for this restaurant was the service!!! Our waiter was on point all night. He never hovered but any time we needed something he was always there to ask. 

Over all the service was a 5/5
Food on the other hand was maybe 1.5/5

Maybe it's an off night, or an off meal. Either way we will not be back"}
{"text":"While frolicking in the Queen west/Ossington area, I stumbled upon Boehmer and was immediately struck by their huge chandelier. We made a reservation for Saturday night, and chose the 9 pm seating.  For its vibe and look, this place clearly deserves a 5/5. The crowd ranges, not too rowdy but it's not too quiet either. The chandelier continued to smitten me as did the overall wooden décor. We could see the kitchen from where we were seated, and it was cool to see the chefs in action. 

I'm glad I got to try two of their cocktails, they were quite good. I got the tears of the bee and the dahlia. The tears of the bee was really refreshing and citrusy whereas the Dahlia came in this cute little glass and intoxicated me with lavender. Service was good. Our waitress was clumsy at times (think breaking your martini glass in front of you), but she was really graceful in fixing it. 

I would highly suggest trying out their harvest platters. The portions are quite good and the quality was also excellent. We got three harvest platters: the smoked atlantic salmon, the chicken and duck terrine and the stilton cheese. When our harvest platter got there, we got chorizo sausage instead of the stilton and our waitress quickly brought over our cheese and did not charge for the chorizo (after all, it was their mistake but that chorizo was so good!) We also tried the beef tartar for an appetizer, and I would rate that a 3. It just didn't taste as fresh and the yolk on top did not add any flavour to it. 

For our mains, I got the chicken fricasee and my bf the ribs. WOW at the portion of the ribs--massive!! And that's not an understatement. It was gigantic and came with beans. My chicken fricasee was really good, the skin was crispy and the baked potatoes were delicious. I didn't have room for dessert, perhaps next time!  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The restaurant isn't open yet, but we got a sneak peek during a private party last week.... what a beautiful space! They are using wood furniture and fixtures from the Dressler Brothers, and all of that is fantastic.
The room is huge, which feels different from all of the other Ossington hot spots.
The highlights had to be the wood/crystal chandelier by the Dressler Brothers, and the bathroom. I literally got teary eyed, it was so nice. 

The pitfalls? There seemed to be a gazillion security cameras. What are they expecting? And unfortunately, the cameras are all a dark grey/black, so they really stand out. The other odd thing.... the photos on the walls. They seem a little cheesy for a restaurant.... not sure what they're about!

I can't wait for them to finish and start seating people regularly, I'll want to be one of the first in line!"}
{"text":"I have now been to Bohmer 3 times and each time was equally fabulous. 

The service was excellent and it was so nice to be remembered and welcomed back each time I went by the various wait staff and management. 

It is a very cool industrial space with amazing chandeliers. While they could cram people in, they most certainly don't allowing for a lot of space between the tables. 

The vibe is very cool, the patrons a mix of wealthy older people and young, trendy and attractive groups. 

Some notable dishes: the foie gras, the beet salad, the chicken, the veal cheek. I could live without the pickerel. Reasonable wine list. 

I'm already excited to go back."}
{"text":"Boehmer rocks my boat! My favourite spot on the Ossington Strip and Toronto could do with more locations such as this. Very trendy looking, good food (love their harvest menu and how you can mix and match for a reasonable price) and to cap it all off they have a fabulous cocktail list. 
Good looking and friendly servers, the ability to accommodate groups and also have tables for those more intimate meals. 

There's not too much else to say really, their food is good, it's not the best I've had in Toronto (but not all places can be the best right?) but you're more likely to get a hit than a miss. And prices are reasonable although I can see some say it's just a little bit more than it should be.

I would recommend making reservations although I don't believe I've seen it be packed often. Looking around at the attractive deco is fun for me but the fact that they can provide solid drinks and food makes Boehmer that much more special.

{"text":"Homer is a term in baseball which refers to a \"base hit on which the batter scores a run\" - more commonly known as a home run.  If I were to use baseball terms to describe my experiences at Boëhmer, I would probably use the term - bunt.  Why?  Well a bunt just passes as a move in baseball that allows the batter to start running, but is not a real \"hit\" if you ask me.  I've been to Boëhmer three times in the past year and I think, like a bunt, they are fooling us into believing that they will give their diners a run for their money.

Boëhmer is located on the increasingly popular Ossington Strip.  You could easily miss it if you weren't looking at the actual numbers as signage is next to invisible (white letters displayed on the window - good luck trying to see that at night!)

It should be noted that those of you looking to dine on Parisian time should look elsewhere, as there is a 2 hour time limit per seating.

The space itself is very open, with a sparkling arborous chandelier hanging over its largest table.  The bland white walls are adorned with canvas art from local artists and then printed fades to bring life to an otherwise sterile interior.  Seating at the bar is available in addition to a private dining room and a lounge which are both tucked into their own nooks.

The prices at Boëhmer are quite grand with entrées ranging from $18-$36.  Sides are on the light side, but an à la carte menu of sides are also available.

It should be noted that the menu on their website is outdated, and should be used as a reference guide to the types of dishes to expect.  Even the cocktail list had been rewritten. I ordered a Pink Rain cocktail which was a rum-based drink with Campari, ginger, hibiscus syrup, pineapple and lime.  I quite enjoyed this drink as it was refreshing, not overly sweetened, and the hints of ginger gave the drink a bit of a kick without being overpowering.  The lime was subtle.  My dining companion ordered a glass of 2009 Monte Velho which was a lighter red which he enjoyed with his main.A complimentary amuse-bouche of smoked sausage with Matzu apples was served which reminded me of Chinese sausage (Lap Cheong) with a bit of heat to it. The foie gras appetizer served with a bitter black currant reduction and Matzu apples was most disappointing.  I love foie gras, and have tasted many mouth-watering, tongue-melting, buttery livers in my day - which was not the case at Boëhmer which served a rather dry and compact one. Mains were most disappointing.  A wild boar, that was so tough and dry took strength and perseverance to cut through.  At one point I just felt like eating it caveman-style with my hands and tearing into the beast with my teeth.  The spaëtzle was note-worthy; it was light and fluffy and the braised cabbage was nice and tender.  It gave my jaw a break.  The Venison was so raw that I was about to wander into the nearby woods to see if a carcass was still lying around from a fresh kill.  I am no stranger to game meats, but this was gamey.  I will add though that both the jus in the dishes were flavourful.  Our server was so unwelcoming that her name might as well have been Medusa with her stone-like indifference.  It would be a cold day in hell before I would order what she recommended with her unconvincing demeanor.

Verdict:

Boëhmer is located in a hip and trendy neighbourhood.  Its interior is nothing special as I can't count the amount of times I've walked into a restaurant that features wood as its theme.  The service was terrible and the food was less than stellar although they aren't shy to charge you a pretty nickel for it.

I had a FabFind certificate in hand which had a $50 value to cushion the steep prices.  With tax and tip our bill came to $158 for a shared appetizer, 2 entrées, 1 bar rail and a glass of wine.  What we actually paid was $50 less than that, which would've rang in at a little shy of $100.  And that's still pretty steep!

Will I be coming back?  Me thinks not!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor on the Ossington strip, one of those boho-chique restaurants that definitely doesn't lack in character!

Went there to celebrate our holiday festivities.  The food was good, not mindblowing.  The service was a bit slow.  The ambiance was relaxing and cozy.

For starters, we were famished, so three of us, in lieu of tradition, shared everything.  We started with 3 little house complimentary AMUSE-BOUCHE, that was nice but the Melba toast seemed a bit chewed.  Together, we ordered the BREAD AND BUTTER, yes, you had to pay 3 bucks for it!!!!  It was good but not 3 dollars good.   We also got the FRIES and BEET SALAD.  The fried were great, they were large and juicy, like fries steaks!!  Its funny, i just read a review where someone else got offended to asking for ketchup, i totally did and the waitress \"forgot\" my request.  Ummm relax, fries and ketchup, matrimony of the skies above.  The beet salad was definitely lacking, there were aye 4 pieces of beets in this salad.  Amongst our hunger, we decided to share another appy, which we settled for the FOIE GRAS, which was delicious but on very thick bread, which took away the flavor and the value of the FOIE.

For our mains, since we did enjoy our sharing so much, we decided to share all our mains too.  we ordered the CHICKEN (long name) it was sweet, quite tasty, so said their \"signature that they've had on their menu since they started\".  Was good but not mind blowing.  I ordered the RACK OF LAMB, I was underwhelmed by it, it was very generic and not memorable.  The bed of carrot purée was much more memorable.  What was really good actually, was the VENISON STEAK, this was cooked medium rare to perfection but it had a very meaty taste and thick texture that still melted in your mouth.  Very dee-lish.

We passed on dessert, but overall, it was a good time with friends.  The tables are big so it was hard to hear if you want an intimate dinner.  The decor was trendy and well planned.  The bathrooms were gorgeous and clean.  The service was inconsistent, I wanted to give her. Good chance, she started out strong but ended very weak, we waited for her to come check on us, from getting our bill to paying... She was clearly more attentive to another table of 2 that picked the right bottle of wine - I hate that.  A bit pretentious for me but overall the experience is like a 7/10.   It's good to go try and a great place to go on a date or big group of friends, but in a few years, there is nothing to anchor its popularity."}
{"text":"Always a favourite for me, their Buck a Shuck night (and $22 lobster) on Tuesday nights is the best. Chef and owner Paul Boehmer is always an impeccable host who goes out of his way to make guests and friends feel welcome. Whether you are going for one of their signature cocktails or full meal, every experience will be worth repeating!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. We went for oysters and they didn't have the oysters or wine that is on the menu we ordered. The manager came to the table and told us to come back next week.   Don't waste your time ! Theres too many good restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Scared at first.
I believed that it was a casual bar/bistro type of deal. 
I specifically wore my supersoft hoody and jeans before heading out.
I was a bit off, but I didn't feel THAT uncomfortable, just a bit.

Boehmer feels like a restaurant situated in an art gallery. Seating was spaced out generously with much room in between each seat and table. The atmosphere was kind of stuffy, although most diners dressed up, I treated it as a fine dining but casual experience. Because I wasn't wearing my suit, I concentrated on the great conversation I was having with my friends and not what others thought of me.

With a spacious and modern dining room comes a modern and exciting menu. It's a bit pricey considering entrees start at $32ish and only go up. However, they do have a harvest menu which gives you a choice of 7 appetizers at a reasonable price (3 for $15).I opted for this, thinking that I wouldn't be full after wards.

I enjoy house made charcuterie, the lost art of cured meats which has now become pretty common. They had house made sweet sausage, house cured salmon, salmon + pork roulette (pate), cheese, and olives? Why would anyone choose olives instead of salmon? Surprisingly, 3 of of these will certainly make you full (unless you chose, like a fool, olives ...)

The cured salmon was fantastic. Fresh, smooth and complimented with the pickled onions. Same goes with the sausage, perfect with the Dijon mustard. The salmon roulette is much better than the pork, smokey and more flavorful.

Overall, the servers were knowledgeable and polite. The water comes as tap, spring or carbonated. The washroom is spacious just like the rest of the restaurant. The food is good and priced reasonably. You get a free coat check, but who knows what happens when you lose your ticket. It was a different but much better experience than I initially thought it would be walking through those doors. I see myself coming back, just next time, in a suit."}
{"text":"Boehmer is a terrific new boite in the very chic Ossington and Dundas area.  
When you enter the vast yet inviting space, you are greeted by a very friendly hipster hostess.  They've done wonderful job at making the vast space comfortable and inviting and are immediately struck by the vast root like chandeliers in the room.
Service was excellent, attentive, informative and friendly as well.
I cant say enough about the food.  Every single dish we ordered was fan-freakin-tastic.  
Not being a fan of raw meat, I did manage to have a good taste of the venison tartare.  DELICIOUS!!  perfectly seasoned, quail egg yolk on top all to spread over sturdy crostini.
Heirloom beet salad was scrumptious as well.
All the main dishes were excellent.  Duck breast perfectly done to medium rare with just enough sauce to enhance the flavour but not too much to have the duck swimming in a gooey mess.  WONDERFUL!
My friend had the Bugs Bunny which was equally delicious.  ;-) 

Dessert was terrific as well, tasty - save for one minor disappointment in the creme brulee which we found to be too runny.

All in all Boehmer's food was well executed, perfectly done, not overly complicated.  

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for a special occasion last year and all parties left very happy. The venison tartare was well-seasoned and easily one of the best tartares I've had. I would struggle not to order it again next time I stop by. The hangar steak (not sure it is on the menu anymore, it came on a bed of fries) was cooked just right. The server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. The portions were satisfying. I'm due to go back again to try some of the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went to Boehmer for a date. Food was delicious and well presented. Wine list markup was pretty high (like 250%). Had venison tartare and lobster/scallop for main which was really really good, wife had a beef cheek that was enormous and very good as well. 
Dosent get more than 3 stars because service was slow and it was quite expensive (considering other options available) but food quality was very good."}
{"text":"Second time coming here, unfortunately it was not as great as my first experience. Seated right away (had a reservation), server comes by promptly, we order drinks which arrive not even 5 minutes after they were ordered. Then things turn sour...we were a party of 2, ordered fires, 20 oysters and 2 lobsters (Tuesday special). 45 minutes until the oysters arrive. Over an hour until our fries and lobsters finally made it to us. 
Server was nice and apologized for the delay, however I felt that there could have been more effort into making the situation better. Will not return."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday gathering so had to order from a prix fixe menu. 

Love the decor and ambiance in this restaurant. Light colour tones that creates a calm and peaceful environment yet chic with a little lounging area and open kitchen. 

Food
The prix fixe menu had a decent selection:  items you would probably see at many similar higher end restaurants. 

Appetizer of either a cucumber wrap salad or Ontario pea soup. I chose the soup - strong pea flavour with a hint of herbs to accompany and enhance the taste of the peas. I'm not a fan really of peas itself but the soup was pleasant and enjoyable. 

For entree there was salmon with curry sauce, steak frites or ratatouille (vegetarian option). I went for the steak. Decent flavour and most of the steak was nice and tender. Jus was a bit saltier for my taste but the fries balanced the strong hearty flavour. Would be happier with more fries on my plate though! Lol overall nothing too out of the ordinary for the entree. Friend got salmon and mentioned it was dry but the curry was delicious.

Dessert options included either chocolate panna cotta or lavender creme brûlée. The chocolate panna cotta was definitely decadent, rich and smooth, more like a ganache in my opinion. It came with caramelized figs which cut out the richness, which is what I needed. Definitely a big hit for those who love chocolate. The lavender creme brulee was full of floral notes. If you can't stand the taste of lavender then I wouldn't recommend it. 

Giving 3 but would say 3.5 overall. Good flavours but nothing out of the ordinary. Ambiance is perfect for any date night or special gathering. Staff were friendly as well. Would love to come back and order from their regular menu."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour with a few friends and I was pleased with happy hour prices, but the menu would probably keep me away at other times.  Fresh PEI oysters were only $1.50 each.  Tiny plates of cheese and meat about $4-5 dollars each.  $5 pints of Creemore and $6 glasses of house wine during this time.  Basically double the price any other time.

The reason I wouldn't pay full price for this is because the food wasn't all that great for what they were trying to accomplish.  I've had much better charcuterie, cheese, and oysters for the same price at other places (which shall rename nameless for fairness sake) and the waiters kept forgetting to bring us stuff.  When you need to remind your waiter to bring stuff to you 3 times before you get it, it just drives me insane.

Would I come back for happy hour special if I was in the area, probably. Would I go out of my way, no? But if you are in the area, give it a shot."}
{"text":"*Updated and in response to reading the GM's reply to my review* - So what you're (the GM's) basically saying is that because Boehmer spent \"thousands of dollars\" on decor that my \"dollar store\" balloons are not worthy of being put on the table. Hmmm good to know that not only is the food terrible but that Boehmer looks down on people who bring \"dollar store\" balloons to birthday dinners. Guess Boehmer is too good to serve us lowly peasants. Lol. Get off your high horse. What kind of establishment is this?? If the GM's response doesn't warrant a lawsuit in the making consider yourself lucky. Absolutely despicable. /Update end

Wouldn't let us put our birthday balloons on the table.. apparently it's the GM's policy.. so much for our celebration. Thought restaurants were places where we could celebrate things like happiness and being with friends.. what a total buzz kill. Also, beef cheek was soooo bland, had to send it back. GM didn't even apologize and asked if we wanted salt and pepper to season ourselves.. seriously??! This is not the type of service we expected from Boehmer. No wonder their online ratings have gone down over the past year. Loved our server though, he was super upbeat so no complaints on that front. In regards to management, it needs work. Don't come here for food or for birthday celebrations. Big disappointment!!"}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I stopped by for drinks and some snacks. The decor was nice inside and very spacious. Beside the restaurant was the crazy ice cream sandwich shop. The food is actually great and we struck a good conversation with the owner who is also the landlord of the ice cream shop next door.

We choose inside as the rain had cooled off the nice summer day. I shared a pasta with a friend while others order some snacks like calamari plus drinks.  Overall, it was an amazing time at this restaurant with the group of friends.  The owner also told us some restaurant trade secrets that was interesting to note.

Restaurant has a nice decor for a group of friend or even a romantic dinner out.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and my first experience was mediocre however revisited for a friend's birthday and really enjoyed it the second time around. I'm not rushing to go back but all around a solid dining spot."}
{"text":"Friday Night, 10:02PM 

Your loved one has an incredible and spontaneous craving for \"steak and soup\" and the closest Keg is too far. They've had a tough week and you want to rise up to the challenge of making them feel better so, you're scrolling through the Yelp app...

Enter Boehmer.

/ end narrative /

My family and I shared (* indicates a highly recommended dish):
*Bavette Steak
**Soup du Jour (Creamy Potato and Leek Soup with Bacon)
*Pan-Seared Quebec Fois Gras
Prosciutto w/ Celtic Blue Cheese
Grilled Octopus / Grilled Calamari

Every dish had such beautiful plating. We found everything to be DELICIOUS with the exception of the octopus. Upon first tasting, we thought the grilled octopus was extremely bitter to the point of being burnt. When this was brought up with our waiter, she made amends swiftly, swapped our dish and did not charge for the octopus. We chose the Grilled Calamari which was so much better! 

We really appreciated how Boehmer managed this. Thank you!

Note to reader: You'll need to look presentable to dine at Boehmer otherwise you'll risk a condescending look here and there from the wait staff. Oh, by presentable, I mean... don't be like me and show up in joggers, crew neck sweater and beanie. No biggie."}
{"text":"I was already a fan of Bohmer for dinner, and now that they added a Sunday brunch service, I had to try it.

Again, the food is delicious. Very fresh ingredients, classic preparation, and perfectly seasoned food. As you know from reading all of the reviews, Bohmer is an upscale restaurant with a small, pricy menu. The brunch menu continues that tradition. It contains classic items like a cheese omelet, eggs benny (which came on croissant! I had this and it was delicious. FAB peameal bacon!), farmers breakfast, pancakes, and a smoked salmon rosti that was also very delicious.

Brunch for two came to $50 (with coffees), so not cheap, but the food is spectacular. 

This weekend will be their third brunch service, they don't take resos, and when we went, at 11am last Sunday, we were the only customers. 

One comment - those chairs look very chic, but they are UNCOMFORTABLE. Replace them! Sitting on one of those for an hour is not good for anyone's back."}
{"text":"The scallop ap with lobster bisque was great, actually came with chunks of lobster! Everyone loved the beet salad - refreshing and yummy. Mains: steak frites was good and cooked to order. Artic char was ok but I would have liked a crispier skin. The sides with this sounded great but wasn't that amazing. It tasted greasy. 

Apple tartin dessert was disappointing but the beautiful amaretto ice cream made up for it. I usually like a generous scoop of ice cream with my dessert and here it was small, especially when it was the star player in the dessert I could have used 2 scoops."}
{"text":"Would this place have a draw if it weren't on Ossington?  Hard to say.  Great industrial space...can feel strange when it isn't busy though - much cooler with a crowd.

First time I went we sat at the big long table with a group of 10 - the bench is awkward if you are wearing skirts, but it is a cool spot for a big group - I wasn't overly impressed with the shared harvest plates / shared apps - kind of stingy - but boy was the bread amazing - I could have left satisfied after a bread and butter dinner - really nice crusty, salty with fresh butter... our mains were also good across the board. 

The next few times I went back I sat at the bar - one of the key bar tenders is a bit of a jerk - seems pissed off all the time - cocktails are uninspired / basic...for instance, I ordered a dark & stormy and let's just say that it was not stormy... wouldn't rate it as a bar, except that there is space if you are meeting a crew before heading somewhere else...

Overall, I think Boehmer is cool, with an neat vibe when the crowd is there.  Over priced but very well executed food - and worth a try, but not a jaw dropper...

hmm reading the above again...think it would struggle if it weren't on Ossington..."}
{"text":"Tuesday night 5-7pm half-price lobster ($22) and buck-a-shuck is a good deal. You get a whole lobster so I thought it was worth it. Garlic butter wasn't garlicky at all and it was cold. The oysters and whoever shucked them were mediocre at best. We sat on the patio which was nice. Service was pleasant but took sooo long, like we were there for 2.5h just for some lobster and oysters and frites. Oh the parm and parsley frites were decent but bellwoods is better. Anyway, it's a nice space but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Meh. My friend recommended this place to me, she spoke highly of it, so I called and made a reservation for my boyfriend and me. The decor was nice however there were random pics of musicians that seemed out of place. Our waiter never smiled once, and was not very friendly. He also hardly made eye contact. I felt like we were bothering him when he had to wait on us, and we didn't ask for anything out of the ordinary. The food was very tasty but a bit over priced. Not a lot of variety on the menu. The waiter ruined the place for me. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place but it fell short of excellent. Nice decor and a bit loud when the restaurant is full.

Although the apps were excellent, the entrees were just ok.
My favorite apps: Canadian Oysters (the best I've ever had), Tuna Carpaccio, and the harvest cheese/meat/fish plate.

Now for the entrees. I ordered the 10oz NY Strip Loin medium rare and it was a bit tough. I also didn't like the fact that is was smothered in sauce?
I also sample the pasta of the day, which was just ok."}
{"text":"Tasteful decor and design!
Fries and bread basket on the appetizer menu are quite good, and of decent size for sharing."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

After looking for a place to grab a bite and some drinks and chill for a bit, my friends and I stumbled across this place on Ossington that luckily had a table available for us.

The space/decor is absolutely lovely- low lighting, gorgeous chandelier, that rustic but high class look. The kitchen is open so you can watch the hustle and bustle back there.

We ordered a few apps to share as we just wanted to nibble on a few things.

We had the fries, the mac and cheese and the brussel sprouts.

I didn't eat the brussel sprouts as they have pork in them and I don't eat pork - but my friends liked the dish.  The sweetness of the sprouts when cooked balanced out the pork (according to them).

The fries were...well fries.  Nothing particularly special.

Now the mac and cheese.  Ummm hello...why is this only an app and not a main dish?!!  This is not like your regular mac & cheese.  It's a lobster mac & cheese but without the noodles - they use orzo!  It's a light creamy dish with hints of this lovely citrus flavour coming through for that slight tang aftertaste.   It's comfort food without the heaviness. I embarrassingly licked that plate clean.  Loved it.  LOVED it.   

The dinner menu is short and sweet - just the way I like it.  About 7-9 choices if I remember correctly for mains.  I was tempted to try the braised beef cheeks but we were eating at around 9pm and I didn't want something heavy so late (yeah I'm old...lol)

The prices are a bit high considering portion sizes from what I saw and the service while friendly was a bit slow.  But if their other dishes taste anything like that mac & cheese I will go back to try out some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Terrible food we tried five dishes not one was good. Tasted awful and small portions. The server also did not do a food check, and they realized we didn't eat our food and didn't ask any questions. 

So many amazing restaurants on Ossignton and this is it one of them."}
{"text":"I passed by this place while I was hanging out in Ossington area. This restaurant is huge compared to the usual tiny restaurants along this strip. As my group walked by, we decided to drop in to grab a drink since we saw many empty seats from the outside. Most places along this strip is small and packed. We came here only because we saw seats available. 

We were greeted immediately upon entering. I have to say I love the decor of this place! Nice furniture and chandeliers.

I didn't try their food so I can't comment much. I looked at their cocktail menu and I ordered the Molly Jane drink. 

Drinks:
Molly Jane (gin, grapefruit juice, lemon juice , lavender)- this drink is nice if you like the taste of lavender. It was a nice blend of lavender and grapefruit. 

Overall, I love the atmosphere and ambience of this place, the decor is beautiful. It is nice place to get a drink. However, prices are on the higher end compared to nearby bars in the same area."}
{"text":"What a delightful find. Casual but elegant dining. This isn't your Thursday night hang out, that's for sure. Meals don't come cheap. This is a once or twice a year splurge place. Also if you're looking to impress your date, you couldn't do worse. Order the bread as a side. It's awesome. I think the menu changes fairly regularly. The eponymous owner is like an uber-chef. He doesn't seem the type to let his menu get dated.

Also, love they have a great stout on tap, too. Another restaurant that supports the PayPal app as well. Tap tap tap pay leave."}
{"text":"I remember the setting more than the food, and that's neither good nor bad. The food wasn't bad by any means - just not memorable. The setting, however, is very elegant and modern. High ceilings, industrial touches and interesting decor choices make it one of the more interesting restaurant settings in the city.

Therefore, Boehmer a nice place to meet up with friends or go on a date, just maybe not as a food destination."}
{"text":"Great service, lovely atmosphere with unique decor, impeccably prepared dishes.   Fois gras and tartar were amazing!  Will definitely come back to try more items."}
{"text":"This is in response to the comment from the business owner.  First of all,  you don't have to be sarcastic about  Yelp \"elite\" gracing your space. I am just a restaurant patron that has the right to voice my opinion. Ever heard of 'freedom of speech'? 
I'd like to formally thank you for sorting through my Yelp reviews and singling out Starbucks and Tim Hortons. 
Since you said I am an' established ' Yelp reviewer,  I don't think I'd need your advice to help my promising career.  Last time I checked,  being a Yelp reviewer or an Elite,  doesn't come with a paycheque,  so I'm not sure what career you are hinting at.  Anyway,  let me go along. 
1. You don't even know what transpired on the phone reservation I had with your host.  Whether she should have taken my name or not is not an issue.  Don't take it on me if your space has lots of empty tables in comparison to the rest of the Ossington strip restaurants.2. I have had the chance to go to better rated restaurants like The Chase,  Jacob's Steakhouse, Octagon,  Terra,  and Opus to name a few.  I have never had the chance to experience a heavy handed? wine pour.  Only in your place.  Must be truly a talent that only the privileged few can do. If you are trying to imply that I'd want a taste of different wines,  I can go to a wine tasting tour for that,but you failed to mention that there was inaccuracy on the amount of wine poured when your server eyeballed  the pour with both hands occupied.  3. If you read my review again (I don't think you'd like to do that again as I can see you are quite sensitive)  I mentioned \"they only had 2 chefs as I've seen in the open kitchen.\" the whole time we were there,  it was just the two chefs unless the rest were hiding? Again   I thank you for noticing that I have a legion of readers. Appreciate the sarcasm. 4. 'good'  and 'excellent'  are both positive yes,  but good doesn't mean I'd enjoy it thoroughly.  Excellent would  be a different story. 5. Did the salty sauce touch a nerve? You seem to be a bit displeased as you types in all caps.  FYI,  Yelp elites do social interactions with business owners,  sorry to disappoint you,  I don't write from my bat cave . That is the reason we post our own pictures to show who we are and that we stand by our reviews. 6. The lobster was tiny period. 7. Again with the caps,  you don't have to be defensive about your silverware.  I have visited places way better than yours to know it has to be the right steak knife.  If I want to learn silverware use 101, I'd go to Martha Stewart for that. 8. So now I know why you reacted like this  you were the rude waitstaff I was referring to, sorry I did not know you were the business owner. My bad. Did you forget to respond to my observation about that patron from the bar that you bumped into and you did not even apologize? And I commend your good memory for remembering our empty plates.  Last time I remember from my GMRC,  it doesn't hurt to ask  'may I clear this up for you?'  instead of just clearing the plates without warning. 9. Don't send out my picture to your peers in Hospitality.  I'm sure if they are your kind,  I won't give them my business. But feel free to keep it for yourself for reference.  I wanted to go through all your restaurant reviews and mention  that this is not the first negative review you had and not the first time you were called rude. ---Jen L.  7/2/2015, Sonia C.  9/21/2014, Suany W.  12/16/2011, Kent P.  3/19/2011, Rhino C.  4/26/2014, Pinky M.  3/22/2014, Julia L 2/2/2013, Lea E.  9/5/2013, Sara C.  10/19/2012, Dave R.  10/25/2014, Justin B 2/9/2013, Lee D 2/5/2012,Alex K,  4/22/2012....and the list goes on.  It must be tiring to spew sarcasm and antagonism every time you receive a negative review.  A good business owner would take notes and take it as a constructive criticism and work on the issues to make sure it never happens again,  than to defensively reply to a Yelp elite with a not so promising career. One advice -  if you are faint of heart,  uninstall the Yelp app from your smartphone so you don't get to read the reviews you don't like. You seem to mock Yelp elites anyways,  so if this doesn't have an effect on your business,  as we are just typing away from our bat cave,  then there is no reason for you to get jumpy.  Chill."}
{"text":"I haven't explored too many restaurants in downtown Toronto, but I was here for work all week, and this was the best restaurant that I visited during the trip. So while I don't have a huge basis of comparison with other restaurants in Toronto, I do hail from SF and eat out a lot, so you can judge my experience accordingly.

My colleagues (8 of us) came here for dinner pretty late, and we got a long wooden table with benches in the middle of the restaurant, so they can definitely accommodate large parties nicely. We ordered a few appetizers to share, and each of us got an entree.

Venison Tartare ($18) - One of the best tartares I've had - I was afraid it might be gamey tasting, but this was delicious and clean tasting. 

Foie Gras ($23) - All of this was delicious and decadent - the brioche, sweet bacon & apples and blackcurrant almost made it seem like I was eating a very fatty dessert. I wanted more than just one bite.

Grilled Calamari ($17) - Compared to the size and price of the other appetizers, this was probably the most bang for your buck. This was perfectly grilled, tender, and fresh.

Halibut ($29) - This seemed like one of the lighter options on the menu and came atop rice and with some asparagus. It was fine but nothing to write home - I've had better fish dishes at other restaurants.

Lobster Mac & Cheese ($12) - This was really orzo & cheese, not macaroni noodles, but every bit as delicious. I couldn't stop eating this - cheesy, with a slight hint of lemon, and very indulgent. Comes in a small cast-iron skillet and great shared amongst the table.

Brussel Sprouts ($6) - Just okay - I thought this would be better with the bacon lardo (sounds unhealthy, delicious and oily), but I prefer my brussel sprouts more crispy and roasted. I wouldn't get these again.

All in all, a solid restaurant with really great appetizers and sides. I wasn't in love with my entree, but would definitely come back. It's on the pricey side, with appetizers ranging in around $14-20, and entrees in the $30-40 price range. If my company hadn't been footing the tab, I would've been a little disappointed since the portion size is not that large relative to the price."}
{"text":"Came out with some friends for the buck a shuck and 1/2 price wine last night. Ended up trying the grilled octopus and it was delicious. However I can only give this place 3 stars due to the service. Our server Jeff was miserable. Took 20 minutes to get me a vodka soda and 25 for a lemon tart. The crust was rock solid. All in all great appetizers and ambiance. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Great food and surroundings.  The decor was a classic rock motif.  Staff was excellent as was the food."}
{"text":"Boehmer, sad to be writing this as you were my go to send spots for clients looking for a cool place on ossington that would take reservations.

Unfortunately my experience will erase your name from my list from here on in.

Showing up after 9pm inquiring about a table for 2, we didn't have resos but space was available lots of empty tables and we were seated. 

Alerted about the specials by whom we thought was our server.... And then..... Nothing... Nothing for at least 15 minutes as we watched him run back and forth past our table avoiding eye contact.... We sat and waited... Then finally bartender stepped out from behind the bar and came to take our order- odd as he saw us sitting there staring the whole time but didn't do anything till so much later but oh we'll...

We order, 3 apps(including oysters) and the steak main... Then we waited....

I would say another at least 15, although I may be giving them the benefit of the doubt- it felt longer... But no food, no oysters... Nada.... Again- they all saw us waiting and wondering and nothing... Finally a bit after 10 my bf was so frustrated he asked the bartender who said he couldn't do anything more then yell at the kitchen.... (Seriously?) \"Dude, oysters!!! And 3 apps... Aren't apps supposed to be quick??... \"

We left- sad as I really wanted to experience that but the arrogance was not appealing."}
{"text":"Imagine Suany Pants and the most gorgeous man in the universe dining at an Anthropologie-looking restaurant that sounds like \"boner\". Are you erect yet? The food definitely penetrated my sweet spot - light and flavorful smoked chicken salad, mouth-watering foie gras and the most g-spot tickling dish of all...lobster thermidor!!! Succulent, texturally harmonious and sexy...this was hands-down the best dish I had during my week-long stay in Canada.  The picture says it all: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ww-qDl1G9Kr7igS3ouA_Cw?select=8bRvkWgdEzOzrjGAB-2rRA. More Boner...I mean Boehmer, please!

The reason I'm only giving out a three-star rating is because our server was a total killjoy. He never cracked a smile and didn't seem to care that our food took FOREVER to come out. In fact, it took so long that we didn't have time to order dessert and had to run out to the car because street parking ends at 12:00 AM in that neighborhood. I need to have my dessert or I'll get cranky!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went for Yelp's 'Crappy' Hour, but we were starving so we explored the neighborhood for food. I must say, this area has made a 360 in the last 10 years. My mother used to teach in a neraby school and when I would go pick her up, I'd think to myself, 'what a sketchy 'hood.'

We first stopped in Piola (don't worry, a review is to come), but due to the lack of service we left and relocated to Boehmer.

First impression: this place is very cool. Boehmer first caught the attention of my sister as we walked north on Ossington heading to Pizza Libretto. The decor here is modern and simplistic. Washroom doors are pretty neat; against white, there's a Wordle with various languages. The lights are super cool too; the bulbs are like tree buds.

The food ...
I don't want to sound like a broken record, but considering it's quite mediocre, Boehmer charges a lot. One of the specials (which was a main) was the gnocchi w chives and rappini. For $18, I was expecting an adult portion. It was tiny and well ...not that great. I could barely taste the pasta or the chives as the rappini was so bitter and took over the entire dish. On the other hand, the burger was pretty good. The accompanying fries though were dark brown; once again, for an $18 meal, it would seem like a no brainer to use new (or somewhat new) oil.

I'm not going to be running back to Boehmer, but I'm glad that I was able to check this place out. Great decor, good service, and a-ok food.

It's an a-ok in my books."}
{"text":"I like Boehmer, stopped in on a whim while on the Ossington strip. Luckily they were able to accommodate us without a reservation. We ordered the following and enjoyed each dish (most notably the scallops):

- Grilled Calamari, Ontario Hot House Heirloom Tomato, Curried Jalapeño Aïoli, Tomato Concassé Vinaigrette
- Pan Seared Scallops, Butter Poached Shrimp, Sautéed Spinach, Yellow Coconut Curry Sauce
- Pan Seared B.C. Black Cod, Sauteed Green Kale, Wild Mushrooms, Baby Bokchoy, Bell Peppers with a Shoyu-Mirin Glaze

The service was excellent, although we did wait an unusual amount of time for our entrees to arrive. That being said, the staff acknowledge the wait and offered a free glass of wine for the inconvenience - and then all was forgiven... :)

They had many things on their menu that looked good, I plan to return to Boehmer and sample the rest of the items they offer..."}
{"text":"I was here for the Father's Day brunch - a buffet style meal, all for $30.

For a buffet, the selection was limited - not a huge surprise, considering that Boehmer is not usually a buffet restaurant. That said, the food that was provided was solid.

To me, buffets are games that are determined by the best items on display - the quality of the meal is only as good as the best item, and the quality of the least good option is negligible at best. In other words - a bunch of mediocre options is much worse than a bunch of terrible options, bolstered up by a single transcendent dish. 

Here, the dish of the night were the short ribs. The rest of the meats were mostly unspectacular: of the bacon, sausage, peameal bacon, and fried chicken, only the fried chicken was something that I would consider ordering if it were on a menu in the future. The short ribs, meanwhile, were seasoned spectacularly - sweet and savory without being too salty, while slightly crispy on the edges.

Other parts of the meal were also quite good. The mac and cheese was in the upper echelon of mac and cheeses I have had recently, the kale salad was light and fresh, and the beet salad was perfectly standard. 

The worst part of our meal was the service. Our waitress failed to do a few things: fill up our water when we needed it, clear our plates, and offer replacement cutlery. In my view, these things are important for a buffet-style meal, unless it is clear that this is our responsibility.

What's more: we saw a table nearby order an omelette. We had no idea that this was an option. Perhaps our fault - but it was another demerit in addition to the subpar service.

Still - IMHO, service comes a distant second-place to the quality of the food. What we had at Boehmer was good food, at a seriously good price."}
{"text":"I brought my family to Boehmer on a Saturday night. We were a large group and sat at the \"Harvest Table\" which is a large wooden table right in the middle of the restaurant. The atmosphere was fabulous, the decor beautiful and enticing and every main dish was top notch. The wine selection is great and desserts were a hit... BUT the service was so so... kitchen was backed up (like they didn't know Saturday was going to busy..) and the server had too many tables to take care of and neglected us one too many times.  Despite the overwhelmed server, the overall experience was fabulous..left feeling full and satisfied. One of the best restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"First off, here's a disclaimer.  My wife has worked with and is friends with Chef Paul Boemer.  That being said, I've loved his food since he was at the Prince of Wales Hotel in Niagara-On-The-Lake.  

I loved this restaurant.  It was one of the best meals I've had in quite some time.  I started with the mushroom consomme, with was simple, but just plain amazing.  However, it was the veal cheeks that were just amazing.  I was in food heaven.  It came with wild mushrooms and this amazing mashed potato, but, even though I love mushrooms, I could barely pay attention to them because the veal was just that good.  I must say something about the dessert.  I tried the Mexican chocolate dessert and I really did taste the chili's and spices in it.  I hate to disagree with another Yelper, so I'll say that one of us got the anomaly.  Since I know and like Paul, my bias points toward the me getting the norm. OK, I've gushed enough.  All I can say is that I really badly want to go back.  

The ambiance is really cool and there was quite the mix of people there.  It did get a little loud, but I'm the guy who likes a really quiet place anyway. I wonder if it's a teacher thing.  Anyway, Paul has done really well and I can see things just getting better as he really hits his stride.  

Call it love at first bite...and second...and third...

You get the idea."}
{"text":"You must begin with one of their marvelous cocktails before getting anything else. They are pretty, delicious, and strong; a happy trio.

Once you are ready to jump into the food, it is oh so good. Everything on the menu has that extra little something about it. When they place the delicious smelling art in front of you, you find yourself fighting the urge to destroy it in the name of your taste buds, or I at least tried. However, as always when I find myself in these bitter/sweet situations, the buds win and the next thing I know, the art piece in front of me has vanished. It is a little like a blackout with a faint memory of amazingness lingering in the background, and it is exactly what happened here; the taste of the food knocked me out. Now, you may be wondering how I can tell you about this foodelicious experience if I had blacked out; all I have to say in reply is: trust me, I'm a doctor.*

* I am not a doctor.**

**Unless we're talking about a self proclaimed food doctor, because I'm definitely that."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends on a Tuesday night and it was great! Super busy and had great vibes!They offered buck-a-shuck, cheap lobsters and wine. What a perfect choice of specials. I had their steak frites and it was lovely! Everything else was better then average and service was friendly and professional. Will 100% go back on any night of the week to eat some classic Canadian fare. 5 STARS"}
{"text":"Good food, nice decor, good service. Not cheap but the food is excellent. We've eaten here as a couple and with large groups, and all experiences have been very enjoyable."}
{"text":"We went here for babylicious and it was such a great event!  The staff was really friendly and accommodating to the baby.
It was a price fix for the event and I really liked the food.  The salad was delicious and had just the right amount of dressing on it.  I had the mushroom ravioli and it was divine.  The only thing that was just ok with the steak and frites my husband had.  The steak was a little tough, but not bad enough to send back.
I would definitely go back here, and would love to sit on their patio some time this summer."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this really nice place last night while walking down ossington looking for a restaurant to eat at. The place looked really nice from the outside and caught our eye. We walked in and was greeted by the hostess, luckily it was early enough in the evening to get a table for two. We ordered the warm olives and calamari to start, both where amazing appetizer . For dinner I had the beef cheek and my friend ordered the veal, both fantastic choices, the flavours where amazing and the beef was tender, and for desert the cream brûlée , just amazing. I give this place a 4 out of 5 cause it gets really loud , so you actually start to shout across the table to talk, also this place can be expensive , our bill with wine was 220, not a cheap night. I would go back and try it again only on a special occasion ."}
{"text":"Nothing we had was tasty, a huge disappointment. None of us finished our meal. The halibut was tasteless, the steak was of horrible quality and my friend gave up trying to chew her duck. Does anybody in the kitchen ever taste their own cooking? It was shockingly bad...... Sorry for such a bad review but for that price (or any price for that matter) and the quality of food.......Shame on you"}
{"text":"Very hip but has concrete floors and no sound baffling so it can be loud. WHAT!? YES, LOUD! We had dinner for 4 on a Tuesday at 730. The restaurant was half full. 

Service was average -we had to wave down our waitress a few times to ask for drinks and extra condiments. Wait staff have a very long walk from the kitchen if you have one of the tables up front so any extra condiments or changes can take some time to arrive. I was half finished my steak before my Dijon mustard arrived. 

Food was just okay sadly.  However, chicken soup special was fantastic and served piping hot. I also had sirloin steak. Asked for it medium rare and arrived medium well. My wife had cod and she said it was good. Potions are small. 

Cocktails are very expensive for what you get. I had the Bohemer vodka cocktail which was okay but the glass stem was covered in the drink when it arrived which was sticky and required a wet towel to rectify. 

Sacrilege: no coasters for drinks so your table is wet and gross after a couple of drinks and they do not have ketchup (homemade or otherwise) on the premises. 

Did not ask about if they had secret menu. 

Rating: won't be back

Note to reader: we are Canadians in our 40s who live in LA but are in Toronto every 6 to 8 weeks for work."}
{"text":"We love coming here on Tuesday for buck a shuck and half priced bottles of wine. They won't seat you till all of the guests arrive which I don't like but I guess I understand their point as it is a smaller restaurant. This is definitely our go to place on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Boehmer. The food and service is fantastic! My favourites - meat and cheese platter, scallops in a curry sauce, rack of lamb and their cheesecake. Perfect spot for date night. 

I live a block away and have eaten here quite a few times. Their Tuesdays buck a shuck deal is awesome. 

If you're looking to host a private party or an intimate company event - this is a top choice in the city. We've hosted two company events at this restaurant. Once in their private dining room and the second for lunch and cocktails. On both occasions, Chef Boehmer and his team were outstanding. Our guests walked away raving about the food, ambience and service."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time! We walked in only 30 minutes before the kitchen closed and still had great service. We ordered the calamari, venison tartare and flank steak. Everything was amazing! No complaints."}
{"text":"Loonie tuesday ! Came here for buck a shuck on a Tuesday. Oysters were $1. Extremely fresh and delicious. 
Also ordered the $22 lobster with butter. It was absolutely delicious. Additionally we ordered the veal tartare and foie gras. 

Everything was great at this restaurant, service was great, food was great. Only problem was that the dinner menu was limited."}
{"text":"any restaurant that makes me wait one hour for my food after already waiting 35 minutes for a table is a one star type of restaurant. being  \"too busy\" as the reason for the delay is just unacceptable. what kind of owner opens a restaurant without expecting it to be busy? would u open a restaurant expecting it to be empty on a Saturday night? NO. therefore, hire enough people to serve good food at faster than a snails pace EVEN when it's a full house!!"}
{"text":"the first round of cocktails my friend, my wife & i ordered were near-mind blowing: unique & creative yet still tasty & refreshing. however, the second round of american rye manhattans my fellow bar-worker partner-in-crime & i ordered were shaken to a watery solution & devoid of any depth or texture. we didn't have any main plates but the several appetizers we shared (the oysters & the venison tartare), while perfectly pleasant, weren't particularly flavorful or inventive. i'm not a pretentious foodie who requires innovation with my dishes, but with the character & facade this place very purposefully emits, you kind of expect it as it feels like they're trying pretty hard to prove something. the servers were super friendly (particularly the female asian 'tender) & i'd be remiss if i didn't mention the absolutely gorgeous decor. i'll have to stop by for dinner the next time i'm in TO."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with the girlfriend for quick bite and glad we did. Ordered the poutine which came with goat cheese and oxtail and it was DELICIOUS. The fries were undercooked the 1st time but they quickly fixed that and gave me a free beer so no worries there!! The lobster mac and cheese was fantastic only wish it was bigger as we loved it to the last fork full....Very happy we stopped in and looking forward to trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"The food is decent but it's also on the pricey scale. The trouble though (as with Terroni on Queen) is the owners like to hire inexperienced servers and incompetent managers to oversee them. The service was initially attentive and courteous, but it's when there's an issue that a lack of experience and consideration shows.

It's so bloody loud at Boehmer (fabric on the 14 ft high ceiling would probably solve this), that I shifted to the side of my table to avoid the yelling match I was having with my dining partner in a half empty restaurant. 

Apparently this move is a no-no so the manager sent a sheepish server over to ask me to move my seat. I moved immediately. But I later politely asked to speak to the manager about this to let him know the issue was with the sound volume and - long story short - the whole thing devolved (by way of his passive-agressive behaviour and my incredulousness) into him calling me a jerk when I couldn't wrap my head around his offer to seat us at a \"quieter table\" two tables away in the same giant echoing room. And all this after we'd finished our meal. Madness. 

My attitude is simple: if restaurant owners don't care enough about their patrons to hire competent staff to serve them, I'm not interested in supporting their establishment. There are too many great spots in Toronto to deal with a mediocre experience. Especially a pricey one."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  Great location on the Ossington Strip.  Though pricy, the food is excellent and the portions are fair.  The Bavette Steak & Frites is my favorite and one of the best in the city.  You can't beat their Tuesday night Buck-a-Shuck Oysters, $24 Dollar Lobsters and half price wine list - though make a reservation."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely delicious! Everything tasted divine. Service was friendly and attentive. The interior design and atmosphere was very awesome... some of the best I've seen in a restaurant (according to my style preferences of course).

They have a large communal table in the middle of the restaurant. 

They make their own water in-house so for $2 per person you can have unlimited house-purified and -carbonated water.

The venison tartare was probably the best tartare I've had. It was perfect in every way.

The beet and goat cheese salad was delicious too.

The bison steak with chanterelles was delicious in every way. I loved it.

For dessert I had crème brûlée and it was amazing. Perfect in every way as well. They use real vanilla and you can see the specs in the crème. A nice shallow crème brûlée, not too deep like some places. Perfectly crispy and caramelized on top. The shortbread that came with it was equally good.

Tea was served in a nice cast iron teapot with a double walled glass. The fancy stuff. No skimping anywhere, it seems.

Overall, Boehmer seems to have impeccable quality and flavour. I love this place and definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"I love Boehmer!

I'm actually surprised its taken me this long to review it...I've been quite a few times for dinner or just drinks, and they never fail to impress!

I recently hosted my birthday party there, and was quite happy with the experience. They have a small lounge space within the restaurant which holds about 15 people, and they're willing to take late reservations, which is always a problem I have with birthdays. We had a great server who was attentive but not over bearing. I would definitely recommend Boehmer to anyone  looking to host a small dinner or drinks!

Even when they aren't making my birthday a success, Boehmer is still a great place. I love their cocktails, and their \"Harvest Menu\" which has 8 options that are updated regularly. 

I also absolutely love the ambiance and decor - hellloooo chandeliers!

Boehmer is definitely a great additions to the Ossington strip!"}
{"text":"Pros: Nice space & service. Great location.

Cons: Not my 1st choice, but all the really good places in this nabe (and some of the soso ones) don't take reservations, and can't seat a group of 8 or more at the last minute/day of.... so my pals and I ended up here. Nice but nothing blew our socks off, but maybe that is because we're all spoiled rotten and do a lot of travelling? Big surprise was that even after 3 courses & wine (total into 4 digits for sure) when we mentioned that the 4 orders of bread pudding they sent to table were all cold, they sent out a round of nearly undrinkable port and proceeded to CHARGE US THE FULL PRICE of all these desserts, even though the kitchen made an error. Comping us the desserts would have cost them less than 5% of our bill but instead, they've lost 8 people as customers... interesting business approach.

For the price, there are a lot better choices in the city, and in the 'nabe."}
{"text":"Tuesdays - 1/2 price bottles of wine, $22 lobsters & yummy one buck shucks! What's not to like?

The oysters were tasty little guys, not those big sea watery snots.  The lobster was delicious!!!! And of course there garlicky butter with it was the cherry on top!

Wine is pretty pricey, but it was fine with the 1/2 off.
Definitely will return on a Tuesday when I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"Agreed with Yvonne, this place was a solid 3.5 star for me.

We visited during Happy Hour (5:30-7:00pm Tuesday-Saturday). $5 pints of creemore, $4 bar rails and $6 house red and white wine, plus half price off all appetizers. (Oysters only $1.50 each during happy hour). You can't really go wrong.

The mix and match charcuterie plates they do are a sweet deal. 3 items for $15 or 6 choices for $29. Portions were generous. The chorizo and the venison sausage were tasty. The goat cheese with balsamic was a bit bland but not bad.

The decor in Boehmer is beautiful, lots of wood! The bar is particularly pleasant to sit at, very comfortable wide chairs. 

The place is empty during happy hour and the server/bartenders were not overly friendly but they did their job. 

Overall this place just feels kind of pretentious - I think it was a mix of both the staff and customers that made me feel this way.

I would go back though, for happy hour. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Beautiful space and an excellent location. Staff were lovely and I loved sitting in the private dining area for my friend's birthday dinner.

I had high expectations of this place and I was disappointed by the quality of the food. The steak I had as a pre-fix main course was not good! It was a fatty cut and chewy, generally not good enough for the price. Was really hoping this was not going to be the case, I was looking forward to a delicious cut of meat that I am more than happy to spend $$$ on.

$15 for your least expensive glass of wine is also kind of insane. Desserts was good but nothing special.

A lot of reviews here share this similar sentiment: too expensive for the mediocre food quality. Maybe this place will make a change to compliment this (keep the price, but make the food amazing!) - probably not returning until this happens."}
{"text":"Boehmer? More like bummer (sorry, had to do it)!

Definitely agree with other reviewers sentiments that for the price, the food is average at best. Quite frankly, the menu seems a bit uninspired and way overpriced. Even after dining off the Winterlicious menu, I didn't feel that the 3-course meal warranted a $45 price tag. 

I had the arugula, goat cheese + beet salad to start, gnocchi as my main, and white chocolate cranberry cheesecake for dessert. Everything seemed a bit underseasoned and nothing particularly stood out -- the gnocchi in particular were huge, gummy, and bland. Dessert was the highlight of the meal; my cheesecake was good (but not great), and I had a taste of my boyfriend's lavender crème brulée which was quite nice. Everything was presented beautifully, but seemed to lack substance, which unfortunately seems to be the theme at Boehmer.

On a positive note, the cocktails we had were delicious ($14), and I love the big open kitchen and the atmosphere of the restaurant. Our server was attentive and obviously experienced -- water was always topped up, we were checked on after being served each course, etc. The beautiful and spacious interior would make Boehmer ideal for group functions, I assume. The tables are spaced out nicely so that you don't have to literally rub elbows with diners beside you, which is a plus. 

I would come back for drinks + dessert, but for a great meal, I would definitely go elsewhere. Good looks are nice, but good food is way more important."}
{"text":"Had a really good dinner with my wife.  Atmosphere was relaxed and service was very friendly and prompt.  I loved the menu- there were a lot of choices that looked appealing.  I ended up with the Venison Tartar and the Veal chop.  Both were excellent.  My wife had the Calamari and the Scallops - also excellent.  

My only beef with this place was the oysters.  We ordered 12 oysters from New Brunswick and they quickly came and were properly prepared with some really nice sauces.   They were very tasty, BUT they were very small.  Cocktail size oysters- not small choice. And  I was shocked that when the bill came that 12 oysters were $42! Cocktail oysters should be a buck or two- but no more.  

Anyway, I did like the place and will return."}
{"text":"I was so hyped to come here and it did not live up to expectations. With such a nice space I wish the food was better. At least someone could make a great cocktail to save my night."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience here the other night. I liked the decor and really liked the fact that the tables are spaced pretty far apart, which makes the place seem really relaxed even when it's pretty busy. I hate being crammed so close to other tables that I have to shimmy my way out to get to the bathroom. Anyway, our server was really knowledgeable and helpful. I was deciding between 2 different wines and he offered to give me tastes of both which was very nice. I started with the beet and goat cheese salad. Yum! Creamiest goat cheese I've ever had. I really dig that they use all fresh, local ingredients. I tried a bit of my friend's venison tar tare (which is way out of my normal comfort zone) and I actually liked it. For my main course I had the chicken fricassee....the portion was huge and came with peas, beans and a few other veggies. It was very tasty. The meat was slightly tough, but that's because it's a natural chicken that has actually run around a bit and not been pumped with hormones to fatten it up. We had an assortment of desserts, including profiteroles, a raspberry tart, a blueberry shortcake and some type of chocolate creme brûlée--which was my favorite since it was chocolaty and tasted slightly of alcohol. Way better than fruit. I left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"Happy Hour! Oysters half price for $1.50 everyday can't really go wrong...

And all the starters are 50% off too... Vension Tartare for $9?! I tried the Mozzarella and Tomato salad ($9) which was awesome....

I wish Boehmer has a different bar menu with some sinfully deep fried fingering food to go with the drinks.. It is just too healthy to be eating salads during Happy Hour.... Yes Deep Fried Food is the way to go!"}
{"text":"We came here on a double date for the Summerlicious menu, so maybe that had something to do with the menu items feeling a little ho-hum.  

I got the potato rosti to start, and I think it may have been my favourite course.  It was interesting and a bit different, with quail egg and arugula (I think).  The bf's mushroom soup was good, but a member of our other dining couple who also had it commented that it could use a bit more creaminess and I agree.  

Entrees!  I had the hanger steak, which was perfectly cooked and swimming in a very good jus.  Onion rings crowned the steak, accompanied by big fat fries, which were good but didn't blow my mind.  Beef got the whitefish, which had a crunchy pilaf going on--solid but not amazing.  Our companions got the fish and the veggie gnocchi, the latter of which seemed to leave the worst impression of all our entrees; not just a few little pasta buds were left unfinished.  

We ordered cocktails--which is to say, I ordered cocktails for bf and I--being inexplicably indifferent to the steep price point ($14-$16) that ranged from very good to just okay.  The cocktail offerings are unique, but I'm not sure that all of the somewhat esoteric ingredients made their way to my taste buds.  The alcohol, however, reliably made its way to my head in time for dessert.

I got the banana bread pudding, which had caramel slathered liberally on its top.  The pudding itself was a bit jiggly/moist for my taste--the kind of texture that reheated bread pudding takes on.  Beeef got the semifreddo, an ice-creamy custard type dish, and it was stellar if small.  Another of our companions insisted that I try the chocolate cake and I was glad I did because it may have been the best I've ever had.  Rich, and just the right balance between dense and fluffy.  I'd go back and order just that and wine.  

Atmosphere and decor:  beautiful--high ceilings, soft lighting, pretty art.  It has the rustic-modern feel that many TO establishments are sporting, but it pulls it off on a pretty grand scale.   

I have a tough time pinpointing what it was about Boehmer that just didn't do it for me, and I guess at the end of the night, I hadn't felt strongly about any one dish.  Compared to restaurants with lower price points and similar atmospheric/culinary objectives, it doesn't come out on top.  It serves a well-executed product, but if you're looking to try something new or incredible, you might not find it here."}
{"text":"Loved the cocktails at Boehmer. 
I loved the oysters, but every time I looked over at another table, I wanted to eat what they were having. I most certainly have to go back and explore what their menu has to offer. Everything looks really good."}
{"text":"Came last night with my wife and mother [93 years old and still sharp as a tack.] The service was friendly and welcoming, no sense of our not being \"hip\" enough, and the sound level was acceptable. More importantly we had a terrific time filling ourselves with the Tuesday night $1 oysters. Demolished 64 with one bad one. We also order the calamari - grilled, not battered, and they were tender and delicious and a huge serving for an appy. Also has the foie gras  which was rich and simply delicious. We will return,"}
{"text":"Since my visit to NOPA in San Francisco, I've been dying to find a spot with a similar vibe in Toronto. I think I've found it. About halfway up the Ossington strip is the umlautted Böhmer restaurant. A former garage turned fine resto, it's spartan and stunning. Concrete floors, beautiful wood candeliers, touches of green vines in wine bottle sconces, all in a gorgeous cavernous space. Touches like the coat rack behind the host's desk are impressive in their simplicity. A communal table the length of a limousine bisects the dining hall, and I really dig how spaced out the tables are. It's loud in here, and I like that. My kind of atmosphere.

The menu is Napoleonic: short and impressive. In fact, the food options are easily dwarfed by their wines and cocktails. I started off with a Ginger Julep (Bombay and ginger liqueur) with fresh ginger and mint. Yes! So good. They also make their own water here. You heard me correctly. You'll be charged for an initial serving of bubbly or still water (if you want it), and it's unlimited thereafter. It tastes nice, but I'm not really sure how they \"make\" it.

Our meals were pretty damn good. We started off with a trio of tartares: venison, scallop, and salmon. The venison (topped with a quail egg) was tender and flavorful. The seafood was served in the passionfruit hulls. I'll admit the the salmon was so-so, but the scallop with it's marrow-like texture was buttery and smooth.

Mains were equally impressive. I scored the chicken fricasee which was gently fried chicken in savoury jus served with the most amazing mushrooms I have ever tasted. My DCs had the arctic char and roast duck. The char had a deep flavour to it, as though poached in brine, and the duck was meaty and rich -- almost like steak.

It was pretty much a flawless dinner experience. If I had to pick on one thing it was the mewling manner of service. Our server was more than bit cloying in his affectations: \"I would like to bring some more water to your table, if that is all right with you,\" followed by some awkward wrist movements. It was weird, but whatever.

Yeah, it's pricy, but I can't wait to go back.

Obligatory Title Pun: The BOH-ld is so beautiful.

Menu Readability: Short, simple and to the point.

Need to mention: They have a cocktail \"named after the winning 1856 democratic ticket James Buchanan and John C. Brechenridge.\" Yep.

What this place teaches me about myself: I will lift my ban on umlauts to dine at this spot."}
{"text":"Celebrated me and my girlfriend's birthday in the private room on Friday and our group of 12 was thoroughly impressed with service, ambience and food. 

Prior to arriving, I was in correspondence with the events coordinator Alana who was prompt and professional; answering the myriad of questions I had about the menu. 

Upon arrival I was instantly impressed by the romance of the modern rustic decor. I am glad we booked private dining as it fit our group of a dozen perfectly but the main dining room would have been nice as well. 

After getting drinks started, our preordered canapes (mini burrata salad spoons & steak skewers) arrived. They were delicious but the steak skewers (off menu item) were especially succulent. In addition to our prix fixe menu we also ordered an abundance of appetizers off the regular menu which was not an issue at all with the staff (I've gone to restaurants that have absolutely not accomodated this in addition to a prix fixe menu). Of the apps that we did order, the harvest platter and pan seared foie gras were to DIE FOR. Unfortunately the Fanny Bay oysters they had tasted a little funky - not sure if this was a kitchen issue or we just ran into a bad batch. 

Mains ordered were mostly seared cod (cooked to perfection) and sirloin (delicous) and desserts were shared amongst the table. We never felt rushed to leave and our service was great.

Thank you to the staff at Boehmer for a memorable birthday experience!"}
