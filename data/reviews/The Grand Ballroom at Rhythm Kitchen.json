{"text":"I have eaten here on several occasions the food and service is always above my expectations. I am a local so when family comes to Las Vegas to visit I always enjoy bringing them here for a nice meal and relaxing atmosphere. I gave my mother a 75th birthday party here on  10-28-2017, upstairs in the private ballroom the food was delicious and more than enough for the 75 guests who attended.   Thank you Rhythm Kitchen for excellent food with great prices."}
