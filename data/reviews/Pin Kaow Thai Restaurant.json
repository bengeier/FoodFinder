{"text":"Back in 2005-2007 this place was my FAVORITE thai place EVER. I'd go here ALLLLL the time. I never had any complaints. Once they started to get more known and got busy, their service started to suck and their portion sizes got cut in half. I have a huge problem with paying MORE for way less food. The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a \"Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew?\" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money. I havent been back in over a year because I refuse to pay $10-15 for dinner and still be hungry after. Sorry PinKaow, you are not what you used to be!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! The pad Thai was the best I have ever had! It has the perfect amount if spice! The spring rolls are to die for! I got my food to go and cannot wait to have it again!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious soft shell crab salad. The thai iced tea is a must. Larb is a bit heavy on the vinegar. Overall though one of the better Thai restaurants in the Vegas valley."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Gorgeous atmosphere- especially the patio! Fabulous food. Love the red curry and the spicy basil. Absolute favorite is the Tom Ka Kai. And don't miss the Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Last week, I had dinner here with my friends and was pleasantly surprised. The waitress was so friendly and smiled genuinely every time she came to our table. I had the spice eggplant with tofu and it was so delicious that I ordered another one to take home. The price is reasonable and the food is good. My friends and I will go back soon."}
{"text":"Pretty bomb Thai food! Love the beef jerky, shrimp pad thai and coconut chicken soup with a side of sticky rice!! You wouldn't think it's nice in the inside from the out but it's a nice chill environment. The service is cool I have no complaints. The place is always busy and I don't every wait more than 10 min to be seated."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is horrible.   I wanted to get some food delivered for dinner, so I called the store around 4:35pm and they refused to take my order until 5pm (and then rudely hung up on me). Despite the attitude I decided to call back at exactly 5 to place my order, when the same rude woman picked up she told me that it would be at least 2 hours since they had 4 orders ahead of me. I am not going to tolerate the double standards, horrible service and small portions anymore. It is unlikely that I will return."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and Pin Kaow is one of the better places in town I've been to.  I get the spicy mint chicken nearly every time I visit, and it's consistently delicious. Their spice scale is about the same as other Thai restaurants I've experienced --an 8 is sufficiently spicy, but not unbearable.  I love the ambience in here. Dimly lit, nicely decorated and quiet. The service isn't exceptionally noteworthy, but it's -- in my experience -- at least as good as any other Thai restaurant in town."}
{"text":"All of the normal Thai dishes like yellow chicken curry are not good here. It tastes watered down. Their vegetable spring rolls tastes like something I would get from Costco. The Tom yum Kung soup is not good either. The only thing decent were the fat noodles my husband ordered. The service was good before because we got the only good waiter, his name is Bon. Everyone else seems like their held at gunpoint to be there."}
{"text":"after a few years of not eating here cuz it was terrible, I thought I'd give it another try. here's my thoughts.. still the worst food ever.. pad Thai fishy tasting. ruined the taste of Thai tea, very expensive for the horrible food. will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are regulars here, and we have never once had a bad experience. The food and service are excellent every time around. I usually like to get the Pad Thai or the Yellow Curry. For an appetizer the Beef Satay is to die for. Lemon chicken also makes an excellent entr√©e. DO NOT PASS UP DESERT! The fried ice cream is so so so SO delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered take out for a party and now eaten at the restaurant. I love the atmosphere and everyone on staff was very cordial and helpful! I love the food as well. I recommend the Thai spare ribs-incredible sauce. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite Thai restaurant EVER. The food is delicious, but the red curry I had was too sweet. The pad see ew and chili mint noodles are delicious, but the best things are the beef jerky, stuffed chicken wings, and my favorite the Lemongrass Trout. I get the Lemongrass Trout with Tilapia instead because I don't like to bother with picking out the bones. The dish is delicious and I wish I could eat it every day. I want to try other dishes, but I keep going back to my favorites. Guess I need to go with a bigger group!"}
{"text":"Come to this place often and they never disappoint. Can never go wrong with Tom Kha chicken hot pot with a side of rice and a Thai tea to drink. Atmosphere is nice. Food comes out pretty quick. They also deliver which is nice to have at home. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love their lunch specials. Tasty thai food + fast and friendly service! Decor and ambiance is also nice."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Service was also very good. For me, this place is the best thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Try their phad see ew and red curry. It's soo good. You'll keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Lemon Chicken, Crab Rangoon, and for an adventure, duck fried rice. Aj had something unpronounceable with beef and hot peppers, and some chicken satay.  All of it delicious. Been meaning to try this place out for a while, had heard good things; really glad we did. They were very busy as it was Friday night, but the service was excellent, the food hot and delicious. The restaurant is located in what is essentially a strip mall so I wasn't expecting the elegant interior. Next time I'll get more adventurous with the menu, but they did really well with my favorites first time out of the gate. The fried rice was excellent,  with huge pieces of tender duck. The crab Rangoon were light, fluffy and crisp, as was the lemon chicken. The satay were very tender and tasty. I didn't risk the beef because AJ asked for the heat too be at 8-10. He really enjoyed it though. We'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"So excited to find a good Thai place semi-near my house.  Just as wonderfully yummy as the other Pin Kaow location and much more centrally located.  The decor isn't quite as nice, but who really cares.  I had excellent spring rolls and green curry with tofu.  Just spicy enough and very flavorful.  Very good service also.  Unfortunately, not everyone was as pleased with the restaurant as I was!  This weird lady at the table next to me, eating alone, just had to inform the server that the soup was \"nice, but it's not worth 5 dollars\".  Then, when the server tried to take something, she said, \"Leave that please!\"  I then heard her mumble, \"Get away from me!  Just get away!\".  I don't know what her deal was, but Pin Kaow is not the kind of place that should cause a traumatic dining experience like this!"}
{"text":"I totally LOVE this Thai restaurant... the Tom ka kai (sp?) (Both the coconut milk based or the reddish lemongrass based) soup over rice is my staple when either dining in or ordering to go. In the restaurant though, is better, they serve it in a hot pot over a hot flame candle and for some reason I think the simple presentation of that alone makes the soup that much better lol. I'm pretty sure it's safe to say that if you like thai food then you'll love pin kaow. The service is always fantastic too, always a smiling beautiful face to greet you."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for dinner on a Friday evening.  First of all, we were seated right away, which is hard to come by in this town.  The decor was amazing, traditional Thai.  Even down to the dress of the staff!   And the food...  Let me tell you, I have tried many Thai places in my time, and I will say this is absolutely the best I have ever had!   We had the Pinang curry with chicken, yellow curry with chicken, papaya salad, and crab rangoon.  My wife and I will make this our regular Friday night outing for sure! I would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, friendly staff and incredible food. Love this place! I will absolutely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Used to be a really good Thai restaurant but after its expansion several months ago the quality has declined dramatically. I ordered takeout from them this week and had to wait 40 minutes after the time they said the food would be ready. There were a lot of people waiting for food and while I was waiting I heard several complaints from diners who received the wrong food.  Anyway once I got home with the food we found that the shrimp in the shrimp salad had not been cooked properly, the beef satay was extremely rare and the shrimp cakes were cold/uncooked. After calling to complain they said they would reverse the charge on my credit card. My suggestion is to wait several months until their kitchen hopefully expands to accommodate the orders from the larger restaurant."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Thai restaurants, friendly faces, reasonable prices, nice menu, great atmosphere and Decor, convenient location. I had the cashew beef and pad Thai. Generous portions for the price excellent flavor, Very nice! The service was a little slow but the restaurant was packed to the gills ...so there's that. But understandable. Overall, I highly recommend it. Nice people and good food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The food was so good!  The Pineapple Fried Rice and Crab Fried Rice caught my eye, although I didn't have either.  Tried the Hell Curry.  Loved it and yes it was hot!!!  Server was super cool!  Loved the Asian style decor inside and the atmosphere overall!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were expecting much more.  The restaurant was highly recommended to us by a friend.  We were rushed in our ordering by the waiter who was not helpful and rude to the other bus staff.  We asked for medium spicy so that we can gauge the spiciness level and we received bland.  I ordered the red curry that ended up being sweet milk and my wife ordered chili mint noodles (their version of drunken noodles) which was basically sweet fried tofu with barely any mint or chili.  We have tasted wonderful food in NYC, San Diego, Dallas and even Little Rock Arkansas and this was by far the worst Thai food we've had. As a vegetarian I would rate this pretty low."}
{"text":"From the look of the outside of this place you would not expect what you get on the inside.  It is really nice.   We had the ribs, chicken wings and ginger chicken.  It was all very good but I think the wings were the best part."}
{"text":"We had a team lunch at this place yesterday and it was my first time going. I had the Pad Thai and tried out the curry as well. The food I ordered was delicious. Some of my co-workers said that the spice level is a little on the lower side so I guess adjust upwards if you like them spicy.   The decor in this place too was beautiful. They have wooden carved artwork hanging, and the booths make you feel toile you are in a Thai temple. There is also open seating outside with a fountain.   I will come back."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef noodle soup... not the best it was greasey the beef tough I've had better honestly if you want pho to a Vietnamese place. I also got the papaya salad hoping it would be authentic but no it was pretty bland.  Sad to say they just haven't won me over as a new customer. Btw I'm Asian."}
{"text":"This place has been busy whenever I've been. That is a bit surprising. The curries are disappointing. Are they making them overly creamy and bland to satisfy the white folks' palate? The green curry isn't even green! It's cream colored. Maybe she misheard me and thought I ordered a cream curry?! I ordered a heat level 9 and didn't feel any heat whatsoever, let alone break a sweat or get a runny nose; did they not believe I could handle the heat? Or maybe she misheard me again and thought I said five? Also, curries come with plain rice; if you want sticky rice, specify that you want that instead of plain rice; otherwise, you get both, which is a waste.   The service was ok.   I might go back for a soup or other non-curry dish, but for now, based on my non-green too-creamy curry, I can't go higher than \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" I've actually made better green curry!   This place is close to where I live, but I think I'll travel down to Sahara unless pressed for time to a more modest but more authentic place to get my Thai curry fix.  The gas money will be covered and then some in the price difference as well."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. My only hold back from giving five stars was on my pad Thai dish ... I like to have lots of vegetables i.e cilantro, lime, carrots. They did put bean sprouts but I was left craving for more vegetables."}
{"text":"If you read my other reviews you'll see that I'm a Thai food foodie. Whenever I travel I search Yelp for Thai restaurants in search of great Thai food. So, keep in mind that I'm comparing this place with some of my favorite restaurants.   This place has fast service.  My cachew chicken was brought out in under 5 minutes, hot and with a generous serving of sticky rice. I ordered medium spicy and it was about a two on a scale of five.   I would rate the flavor three out of five. I've had better and worse.   I would recommend this place if you're hungry for Thai food and live nearby.   This is my first review from Las Vegas, look for at least a couple more."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 yrs.  Obviously I like it. Food is good. Prices are fair.  Complaints:             service is normally very good except getting the check (ask for it early)           Spicy level I think changes depends on the cook (we like a little spicy but not too much). #2 was more like a #4 once. Kids couldn't eat it.   That being said, I've never had to send food back or a complaint about cleanliness. That's hard to say these days.   From the outside it looks like a dump. I like that because they're often busy."}
{"text":"Very expensive and the food wasn't even that good. Ordered to-go for Mongolian Beef, Tom Yu Goong and Thai Tea. Portions were too small for a ridiculously high prices. Wait time was almost 45 minutes. I don't mind waiting this long if the food tasted good! Never going back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Went to Pin Kaow last night with the boyfriend for dinner. The interior is very nice, its dimly lighted and kind of romantic haha.   We started with the stuffed chicken wings. I thought it was very dry. It only came with two of them and we discussed how many they normally come with at other Thai restaurants we've dined at. The cucumber salad that accompanied it was good. We ordered the salmon green curry and spicy mint tofu. WOW, we were very disappointed when it came out. No joke, the portions are tiny as hell!! Seriously.. these are entree portions?! I almost wanted to laugh when they brought it was but decided to refrain from that.  The salmon curry was yummy. I have never tried green curry with salmon and it was delicious although next time I'll stick with chicken or tofu. The spicy mint tofu was not as flavorful as I hoped but overall was fine. Just the portions really bugged the hell outta me!   The workers were very nice and always made sure to fill our waters and too see if we wanted more beer or wine.   Sorry, probably won't return. I'm sticking to Thai House on Maryland!! For the same prices, you can get waaay more food. Last night was seriously the first time I ever went home without any leftovers from eating at a Thai restaurant! Disappointing!!"}
{"text":"The consistency is what does it here.  Like any restaurant you will have an \"off\" serving, but I have been here many times and the quality is consistently good.  Their spice level tends to be on the mild side so you'll have to up your number by one or two.  Although less authentic then say \"Lotus of Siam\" and (no comparison in the wine selection) the quality is on par.  Great find in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest Thai food eater but this place was ok. It didn't really blow my mind. The pad-thai noodles with shrimp, #5 in spicy-ness was good and the green curry with beef, #7 in spicy-ness was not too spicy and I was slightly disappointed. I like the fact that it's close by and I loved their Thai tea.   The service was good, they were friendly, and my water glass was always full. They also tried their best to seat everyone asap."}
{"text":"Our first time here and a very unpleasant experience. Service wasn't great and food was blah.., Food presentation were a mediocre, happy hour appetizers were like kids tea time. Won't be back, sorry"}
{"text":"Really, really good food. They have fantastic lunch specials, as well. The carved wood decor is beautiful. This might seem weird for a restaurant review, but the bathrooms are quite a step up from what I'm used to seeing in restaurants. I love their red curry, and their pineapple fried rice is another favorite."}
{"text":"Quiet and not busy at around 8 on a week night I was impressed by the food.  They gave me spot on recommendations and enjoyed it.  Will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've lived in Thailand. This restaurant is run by native Thai people and the flavors are quite good. We had Thom ka soup, phad thai, and panang curry. All were good. Not the best I've ever had (but I've eaten a lot of Thai food). You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The review is more like 3.5 stars. I've been here TWICE, and the first time I was blown away. My friend and I went at nighttime and sat outside on the patio. Service was fantastic. I had the red curry with chicken and rice...really delicious, nice and spicy, and the small carafe of sake. The service was great also...the staff was really attentive to our needs.  Since I was blown away by the service and the food, I took my family there the week after during lunchtime, thinking they would be impressed by the decor and service. BOY, was I wrong. My parents are already picky when they eat out, and the staff did not help their perception of the restaurant. Service was INCREDIBLY slow, even though the restaurant wasn't crowded. Our waitress had quite an attitude on her. At one point, my dad tried to signal her to our table and she barely looked at us and told the busboy to come over and help us out...WTF? Also, they charge 3 bucks for thai iced tea...which I think is kind of steep...plus no refills.   I'm going to have to say that my favorite Thai place is STILL King and I on Windmill and Pecos. This restaurant definitely got my hopes up, but then dashed them just as quickly."}
{"text":"Not cheap for thai food, but is so authentic and delicious. I lived in thailand for 2 months and this takes me back! Try their larb chicken (ground chicken salad with lime and mint - spicy and refreshing), the tom yum, the panang curry, the silver noodle salad, the pad see ew and the pad prik king. SO GOOD!! I have been to the other top rated places, but this is always the most flavorful and crowd pleasing. I come back again and again."}
{"text":"The perfect place to go for a lovely evening., featuring extraordinary service, excellent Thai food, and a romantic (in that it's quiet, has background music playing, and is softly lit) atmosphere. The closest to  authentic Thai atmosphere I've seen outside of Bangkok.  Highlights: all the food, of course, but in addition a full bar with great cocktails, attentive but NOT obtrusive wait staff (we especially appreciate that they do not hover and scoop up one diner's plate while the others are still eating), taking drink and appetizer orders before the main entree orders AND not serving the entrees until the appetizers were consumed. We cannot wait to go back--our new fave Thai place--even better than Archi's!"}
{"text":"Spare ribs need (spare time).  Came around 6 pm on a Saturday night and to be seated, did not take longer than a minute. For appetizer, we got calamari and for the entrees, we just ordered pineapple fried rice and BBQ spare ribs. Appetizer came out within 5 minutes. The entrees took about 20 minutes.  The pineapple fried rice came out on a half cut pineapple bowl, hot and tasty. Did not add any spice. The spare ribs were cold/room temp. Had to ask them to reheat them but now at this point I just wanted to leave. It took another 10 minutes for them to come back with heated ribs and at this point, I was ready to leave.   Once I saw our waitress, I asked for the check. Shortly after another lady, who I think is the manager/owner, asked if I needed a to-go box for the ribs. I said \"no thanks, just waiting for the check.\"   The second I told her, she saw right through me. She noticed that this 6'1ft 260 pound Filipino man was not happy. I told her I did not like them as they were cold when I first received them and their waitress confirmed as she was about to hand me the check. The older lady told her something in Thai to not charge me and she went back to adjust the check.  1 star for being seated quickly and another 1 for noticing that my fat hungry ass was not happy with the ribs."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Ordered only two items and an appetizer, but waited almost an hour to finally get served. The place was empty when mom and I walked in. Apparently, we were the first customers for the day. So imagine our annoyance when other people who came in after us were getting their food first."}
{"text":"This place is the worst, small portions, overpriced, hit and miss service and vegetarians beware. Found pork in my curry and they gave me a hard time when I insisted on a refund. I used to go here all the time but it has gone downhill since they lost their manager to Gaati. Save yourself the trouble and drive a few extra blocks to Gaati instead."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Best curry ever!  I cant seem to order anything else when I eat here.  Service is great as well!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Last nights dinner (take out) was disappointing.  We have ordered a couple times from here in the past, and this was not what we remembered.... or perhaps we have just been to enough other top-notch Thai restaurants since then?    We ordered the Crying Tiger beef, catfish green curry, and chicken pad thai.    The crying tiger beef was ok -- it was basically a steak with a little heap of salad and a big wedge of cabbage.   The sauce was good, but we would have preferred if the steak were marinated in it more.    Catfish Green Curry was pretty good, but a little salty.   Otherwise we would go back for that dish!  the Pad Thai was well, pitiful.   Cooked well, but hardly any flavor - not what one would expect from pad thai.     Added some of our own lime juice (it did not come with any lime) which made it more palatable.   Needed more sauce and it would have been good.   Overall, not a bad meal, but we probably won't be back -- Especially not for their prices!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least more than five times and the food has always been delicious! They have great lunch specials from 11am-3pm, which comes with an entree, soup, rice, wontons or egg rolls for under $10. I also love how conveniently close it is to the gym - nice post-workout meal!"}
{"text":"The food is GREAT. The noodles, the rice, the STUFFED CHICKEN!!! Friendly waiters and staff. Very attentive to our drinks and clearing our plates. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was so great. And service was excellent even if when they were busy. We had Thai style BBQ chicken and yellow curry chicken. It was so good. This is an authentic Thai food you'll definitely have to try. 10/10 for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  We get the coconut milk soup with shrimp.  Service is consistently good.  Prices are extremely reasonable for quality."}
{"text":"This was my first Thai experience so I'm not sure if I'm being fair.  I wasn't impressed with anything and the service was a little slow."}
{"text":"We eat here atleast 4 times a week because its close to our house.  I order the spicy basil \"Level 4\" which is just the right amount of hotness for me.  The food is excellent and you can't beat the value."}
{"text":"This place blows the other Henderson options for Thai out of the water.  The food has always been fantastic.  The chicken larb salad is awesome.  I am a huge red curry  and panang curry fan, but a friend recently got the chili mint noodles and they were outstanding, too.  It is a rule when dining here with others that no one orders the same thing as to ensure the most opportunity to taste lots of delicious things.  The Pin Kaotini is also quite yummy.  The portions always allow for a great late night snack or are also the best cold the next morning for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant on this side of Vegas.  I eaten there several times and every time the meal has been delicious.  Great atmosphere much better than the typical strip mall restaurants"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The red curry is great,  as well as the mint pork. Yum! Their regular 1-10 spice level isn't THAT spicy so I usually get a 10 and it is just right.  The service is great,  maybe not overwhelmingly friendly but fine.  The interior is not what you would expect from the strip-mallish exterior as it is warm and inviting. Certainly a regular Thai stop."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time coming here this week. The first time was for lunch. I got the chicken pad Thai with no peanuts. The first time the waitress brought it out to me, it had nuts, so she took it back. The second time, it came out with no nuts...and it was pretty good until the end, when I discovered a few nuts at the bottom of the dish :(  Today, I came for takeout. I got the duck fried rice, Tom-Ka-Kai, and the spicy basil with chicken. The duck fried rice was good, but didn't have much duck meat. It had mostly the fatty skin of the duck, with little meat. The Tom-Ka-Kai had really good flavor, but had WAY too much inedible stuff in it (like the galangal root, lemongrass, bay leaves, etc). Most of my bowl was full of stuff I couldn't eat, so I had to kind of slurp around it.  The spicy basil was decent. Nothing to write home about. Not sure if I will be back, I might try a couple of other Thai places around here to see if they are any better. **p.s. I walked in to place my take out order...the girl who took my order has great customer service skills!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for so long I can't remember. The hot pots, the duck, the sticky rice, the people, everything about this place is awesome. Will always be a favorite and will always be a regular. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite Thai restaurants. I stop by at least once every time I'm in the area. My favorite dishes are the crab fried rice,  yellow curry, gulf of Thailand, and of course pad see ew. Every dish here is just more \"elevated\" than the dishes you'd eat at any other Thai restaurant. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Step into a quiet, traditionally decorated Thai house where all the servers are dressed in formal Thai clothing, that almost makes me feel naked in jeans and a shirt. My family calls this place the pink cow, but only because we adore it so much. Strap in and buckle down for some spicy soup served in a bowl that is literally on fire (get either the Wor Wonton or the Tom Yum Koong -- though my dad just describes these as the soups with the shrimp and the spicy and the lettuce). Ordered:  Chicken Sat Tay -- Delicious! Only comes with four though, might want to get more.  Masaman with Tofu, level 6 -- Not that spicy. Could have definitely added a few notches to get a real kick in the face.   Chicken BBQ -- I'm not a big fan of this but everyone else gulped it down. I just think it's not spicy enough.   Spicy, soup, with the shrimp and the noodle things -- as my dad called it. I have no idea what the waitress brought (I think one of the wonton soups), but it was pretty tasty. The wonton soups don't give you a lot of shrimp so if your taste buds are flamingo-like in tendency you should order the Tom Yum Koong.   All very good. Top it off with a Thai Ice Tea that could only be better if someone could figure out how to put alcohol in it. Kahula maybe? Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the first time. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the it really does make you forget you are in Vegas. Very nice atmosphere.  I ate the Red Curry at a number 10 with Shrimp and we also ordered Chicken Satay and Red Curry with Chicken at a three. The food was excellent. I did think the 10 wasn't very hot. It was hotter then the three which seemed very mild to me. This may just be my tolerance for spicy or hot food though but other places I've eaten at seemed much hotter, even at a 7.   The portions were decent and the price came to about $50 bucks with desert and three drinks. The price seemed reasonable. I was satisfied with both the service and the value.   The one complaint I have is very minor but I thought the amount of rice served with the meal wasn't enough. Still I'd recommend you stop in."}
{"text":"Awful NEW manager named \"MON\" who treated our family (longtime customers for over 10 years) so incredibly rudely!  We were less than 10 minutes late due to holiday traffic and she gave away our reservation. No problem, our bad. We decided to wait since it was our fault for being late. As tables opened up she gave tables to other customers with NO reservations. She finally pointed out a table for us instead of the booth we requested, so we said that's fine. Then, she CHANGED her mind and gave us a table located near the door where cold wind was blowing through.  Wow. Don't ever be a few minutes late here if you have a reservation. Sad to say after so many years of being loyal customers this new manager named MON will give us pause as to whether we should ever return. Terrible manager!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Pin Kaow many times and the food is very good. However, I went there last night at 9:25pm and immediately upon walking in the manager told me the restaurant will be closing in 15 minutes.  Clearly on the front door it says they close at 10pm. However, the real issue is they should have been much more accommodating to any customer, especially a regular customer. Instead they unnecessarily turned down business. I went to Gaati Thai restaurant right after and they were much more accommodating and have much better food. They also close at 10pm and even though I got there at 9:45, they still set up a table and did not rush the meal at all.   I will never go back to Pin Kaow and will no longer recommend it to friends and family. That is thousands of dollars lost for their lack of customer service and decency."}
{"text":"fast service, nice atmosphere. friendly staff. i had thai style bbq chicken and steam rice. the food tasted ok the chicken didnt have that fresh off the grill taste. tasted like its been sitting in the fridge precooked and microwaved. the steam rice was good."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem with great authentic food. Four of us went out to dinner on a weekend night and was seated right away. Always a good sign when there is a consistent flow of people waiting for their takeout food and practically all of the tables are already occupied.   It has a cozy atmosphere where you do not feel rushed. The staff was friendly and quick to get refills or check on us. The food will leave you very satisfied. The Thai tea and Pad See Ew was delicious and wroth getting it again next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow has the best Thai food I have ever had!!!!  I no longer live in Las Vegas and I miss it so much.  I have tried every Thai restaurant in my new area and none come close to Pin Kaow.  Every time I come back to Vegas to visit family I eat here as much as I can because it is so good!!!  Keep up the good work : )"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited back in september . Since then we order take out if our days are long andv dont want to cook.The resturant is beauitful . All wooden accents tranquil and inviting. Service is pretty good. Food delicious . The curry and potatoes is addicting . Probaly my favorite asian themed resturant .authentic"}
{"text":"3$ for brown rice! A rip off!  I ordered basil shrimp and got mint shrimp instead.  The rice came midway through my entree after asking twice for the brown rice.  One it arrived, it was dry and smelled old."}
{"text":"Really friendly service, and excellent food! All around delicious, good portions, and great prices!"}
{"text":"Company policy is not to serve eggplant in panang curry among other vegetable combinations. Not that  there is an extra charge which I would understand, but that they simply would not make it due to their \"company policy\" . I think that this restaurant has forgot their purpose for being in business: to make people's food the way their customers like to eat it, while charging what is fair, and getting their customers to want to return. Having company policies about which ingredients are allowed and which aren't is absurd. We didn't even stay to attempt to eat, why should I pay for a meal that is made the way the cook wants to make it rather than the way I want to eat it."}
{"text":"For years this is the best Thai around! The pad see ew is our favorite."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I love the setting and outdoor patio, but the food quality is horrendous. Chicken tastes very old and frozen. Service was slow combined with being harassed by the buzzer for my plate. I used to like this place but hadn't been in years. So to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Their pad prik king is tasty, and their prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"They have really really good food!...but really poor service...but there food makes up for that its good. The portions are on the small side so dont get confused and order one plate to share (like other thai places) because you will starve, and the Thai Tea is really good but there is no refills (like other thai places)..but all in all ther food is really good, and the place is decorated beutiful"}
{"text":"First review I've ever written on yelp!!!!! This  is by far the best Thai food restaurant EVER!!!! Great service and I kept reading all the reviews about chili mint noodles and hands down the best noodles ever!!!!!!!! And if you like spicy food get level 8 because level 7 ain't cutting it lol!!!!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service tried to order takeout the lady who was answering the phone put me on hold 3 times. Rarely understands english I guess whenever she didn't understand me she put me on hold and she makes me repeat my order and i was asking about the menu i didn' t remember exactly to order she put me on hold again n other lady answer the phone and she was rude as well so i was asking do i have to go over my order again? she was like no i have your order then you tell me earlier instead of say nothing so i just felt why am i waste my time here? Plz do have knowledge of your menu and basic phone manner to the customer i used love their foods but i guess not anymore!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Vegas. Not only do they listen when I tell them I want it hot, and not white people hot, but they are also quick like bunnies. We can do a full meal and be out of there in under 40 minutes at lunch time. Service is excellent, wait time is minimal (if at all) and their choices are great. I am a panang snob and their's is perfect.   The best way to judge any cultures food is by the crowd. When you walk into a Thai food place to find it full of asians, you know you're in the right place. Try it."}
{"text":"The service here is really great. The server never let my water get below half and was on top of everything. The food is really great. Different as it is a lil sweeter than other restaurants. Ordering a #9 or #10 will counter balance the sweetness. Overall this place is great"}
{"text":"Been by a thousand times. Finally stopped in. What a find. Great food and very nicely decorated . This one is recommended."}
{"text":"I know I'm swimming upstream here in not loving this restaurant, but, frankly, I think that if you're looking for true Thai food, you can do better. The entrees here are simply too sweet to be authentic. Perhaps if I'd asked to have the meal prepared without extra sugar I might have enjoyed it more. I found the food to be way too sweet, way too sticky, and, even though I ordered the curry hot, way too bland."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant.  You have to order the crab rangoon and the seasonal pumpkin curry. Solid on every regular Thai staple. Their Thai iced tea is everything you want it to be.  The prices may be slightly higher than other Thai places, but you're paying for consistent quality across the menu and way better ambiance than the competitors, full of wood paneling, Asian screens, and mood lighting. Good place to take out a visitor that's relaxed but not too casual (dumpy) (I'm talking about Mix Zone).  One thing I love/hate about Pin Kaow on Rainbow is that I always run into a random from my past. Like old friends' moms."}
{"text":"I normally get rice dishes from this restaurant and they usually taste delicious. Unfortunately, I tried something different today and was very disappointed in the preparation.  I ordered massaman curry with beef with a spice level: 6. It wasn't spicy at all but my biggest gripe was the semi-raw potatoes in the curry. The potatoes were extremely hard and clearly undercooked. Sadly the dish was filled with these raw potatoes. Very disappointed and won't order this dish again from this establishment."}
{"text":"Pin-Kaow is a pretty good Thai restaurant in the middle of a not very good-looking plaza.  First, I will note that, as is common with Vegas restaurants, it's not the cheapest Thai restaurant.  However, they always seem to be busy, and you can see why with the quality of the food (I've had the yellow and massaman curries and the spicy eggplant with tofu - the yellow curry was passable, and the massaman curry and spicy eggplant were fantastic).  I'd say it's one of the few places in Las Vegas where the quality of the food actually reflects the price.  Now, keeping that in mind, the best Thai food I've ever had cost me $6 and I would've easily paid $20 for it.   Overall, even though it's not quite \"As Good as it Gets\" for a 5-star rating, Pin-Kaow makes for a nice but still affordable Thai option in Las Vegas, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a nice evening out."}
{"text":"absolutely pathetic service!  they barely speak English.  we've tried they're delivery service with no luck.  they can't understand English so they never get the order correct.  then like last night they tell me I have to wait over an hour for the driver to return to correct their mistakes.  while I have a partial order and a hungry family.  unacceptable!  the portion sizes are embarrassing.  considering the inflated prices.  do yourselves a favor.  go to thai house instead.  great service.  much larger portions. And if they make a mistake the owner himself will drive to your house in a timely manner to correct it.  3 strikes and your out pin kaow!  in an economy like this I don't need to waste my money on your piss poor service.  never comin back."}
{"text":"I've been to and have worked in many different restaurants over the years and I can honestly attest that the 1974 N. Rainbow location (one of several in town) of Pin Kaow Thai Restaurants is among not only the best Thai restaurants I've been to, but among the best restaurants overall that I've enjoyed.      Right off the bat one refreshing thing about Pin Kaow is its location. On the corner of Lake Mead and Rainbow Blvd it's a location convenient enough to save anyone from my side of town (NW side) a trip all the way down to Spring Mountain road or \"Chinatown\" where most of the cities sought after authentic Asian restaurants are located. There's also plenty of parking out front, a nice change of pace that you don't usually get with most Spring Mountain restaurants.  It can be hard to spot at night however so I would just remind people that it is directly across the street from a \"Joes Crab Shack\" and has a large \"Windmill Water Refilling\" station in the front parking lot.      The overall appearance of the restaurant inside is very clean and very nice. With wall to wall teak wood furniture, comfortable dim lighting, traditional Thai d√©cor including floral arrangements and an average restaurant noise level, Pin Kaow feels very warm, comfortable and inviting. It's the kind of restaurant that makes you and your party lose track of the time and simply enjoy each other's company.       Service at Pin Kaow based on our experience has been great. Immediately upon entering you're greeted by the very friendly and energetic hostess staff wearing traditional Thai costume who after seating you will sometimes deliver you your drink order (if the servers are busy).  The Servers are also polite and knowledgeable with the menu, and thankfully will talk certain patrons out of ordering beyond their capabilities when it comes to the spicy levels of the food (levels 1-10).        Last but not least the menu. With all of the positives this place has going for it, if the food wasn't up to par, I simply would not go. But the food however is GREAT, and comparable to any other Thai restaurant in town, including those located on Spring Mountain rd. I would recommend starting with the chicken skewers served with a side of peanut sauce, followed by an entr√©e of either the beef Pad Thai or Cashew Chicken, finished with a dessert of Sticky Rice with Mango then washed down with happy hours two for one \"Chang\" brand Thai beers."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wonderful and handsome husband. Ordered yellow curry, beef satay and chicken mint noodles. Delicious food but their portion size is enough for 1 person. There were probably 7 small pieces of chicken in the curry and more potatoes. And they don't give refills for their Thai tea. Overall delicious but small portions and pricey. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite dish is the pumpkin squash curry.  I never go more then a few weeks without visiting my favorite Thai place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in Vegas.    They have the best Chicken Satay ever!  The servers are very nice and the place looks awesome with everything made from wood.  They also have a nice sized patio area as well.  I can honestly say I have never tried anything that was not good.  They only get 4 starts because the 5 star rating is reserved for another Thai place not in vegas.  If this rating was for vegas only, 5 stars all the way!  Just so you all can trust my rating, I have been to thailand and several of my close friends are thai and even own restaurants so i think i'm a decent judge of thai food.    If you can get off the strip go check this place out, I think you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I came across this thai place and decided to try it out. The restaurant has a good selection of food. Food was good and the place was nice and welcoming. I wouldn't say it's my favorite place for thai food, but it's not bad."}
{"text":"A very pleasant and inviting decor throughout the restaurant. The staff all wear traditional Thai sarongs which definitely adds positively to the dining experience.   We ordered the Hotpot of the shrimp soup to start and it was absolutely delicious. It had a very pronounced and delicious lemon grass and ginger flavor with a satisfying quantity of large-sized shrimp.   For our main course, we ordered Green Curry Chicken, Pad Thai and the Seafood Surprise. We elected to get 5/10 for spicyness. The next time I might go up to a 7, but adding a bit of hot sauce made it spicy enough.   The Seafood Surprise was surprising in the quantity of seafood included and it had a very nice sweet, tangy flavor that gave the dish a delicious taste. The green curry was not the very best I've had, but it came awfully close. We elected for the pork which was cut into fairly tiny pieces and didn't make any kind of impression, but the curry compensated The pad Thai was not particularly memorable, but more than adequate.   The portions were well sized. There were 3 in our party, and we had enough food for four. At $50 (no drinks), it felt reasonably priced.   Overall, not blown away but very satisfied. The location is very convenient and I expect I'll go back frequently."}
{"text":"Crab rice is very good, as well as desert. And I like the decorations Of this place a lot. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I've never dined in this place but I've done carry out a few times. This place is very nice with beautiful Thai d√©cor and is a bit dark inside. The service is average. I've never had problems with the service. I consider myself very familiar with Thai food as I have been eating it since childhood. Overall, the food here is solid but the last time I ordered from here, I was disappointed (this was maybe 2 months ago).  The pad thai portion was kind of small, very oily, and there was barely any meat. I almost thought maybe they forgot to add the beef I paid extra for. I have been to Thai restaurants that are better so I may not return here."}
{"text":"I have been going to Pin Kaow for years and have loved it always!I have also been giving every other Thai place in town a chance but have to say that Pin Kaow is the best! Be far! Love it, always go back to it, service has never bothered me, just chill out and enjoy the food.  The great prices are just an added bonus."}
{"text":"I love the red curry here. Service is fast and they always make my thai tea just the way I ask. Place is a little boring but the food is terrific. Yum!"}
{"text":"One of the classiest Thai restaurants in vegas !!   The setting is very elegant and traditional. Service was fabulous everyone had such great energy and positivity.  Started off with some spring rolls which were amazing ! The chicken pad thai was really good filled with flavor.  Their mango sticky rice is my favorite dessert but is only available in season so double check with your server if they have it .  Love the venue and the food cant wait to go back !"}
{"text":"When it comes to Thai food we always come here. Love the the shrimp fried rice and catfish delight. Staff are very friendly, place is clean and organized m"}
{"text":"The manager is a complete idiot. She literally gave us an empty container for our to go order and told me that it is the correct portion. Then while I tried to explain to her how it is not possible she said that's how the portion is and then she rushed me off the phone. I will never order from here again! It is way over priced to not actually give you any food. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Decent Thai cuisine, neighborhood spot.  Seems authentic.  They ask for your spice level - appreciated.  They have brown rice as an option - which is great.  Basil dish was tasty!  Went for lunch - looking forward to going back to try additonal menu items."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The staff is always super helpful and fast. Never really a wait, 5 mins at most. I have been coming here for over 4 years now. My favorites: crab Rangoon, chicken pad Thai and sweet and sour pork."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite place until the last two times where items were left out of our takeout order. The first time I blamed the person picking up the order for not checking before leaving the restaurant to see if they forgot anything. This time the item we ordered had been sold out AFTER we ordered but before we picked up so PinKaow decided to sub a different item and not tell us. They lied and said it was the item we ordered. When it was brought home it was obvious that we didn't get what we ordered. After a long wait on the phone we finally find out what happened and then they hung up. This is so beyond unacceptable. Their food is ok - WHEN you get what you ordered. I doubt we will come back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pin Kaow for at least 8 years. I think it's the best Thai food in the city. I have only eaten at the original location on Lake Mead and Rainbow so I don't know how the other locations are, but this one is great. People have told me that they prefer Archie's, but I thought it was terrible. Pin Kaow is pretty consistent and with all of the remodeling the decor is nice. I use Pin Kaow as a standard to compare all other Thai places to, and I have never found one that I like as much, not even in other cities. I recommend the shrimp rolls, Tom Ka Koong soup, and the Pad Woon Sen. Oh, and of course the Thai tea."}
{"text":"Service is excellent and the food is always on point!  My boyfriend and I are thai food enthusiast and this spot is definitely acceptable.  Love the atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the place was very noisy and the service much to be desired. However I would still recommend it because of the food!"}
{"text":"OMG! Delicious. Scrumptious. Calamari appy great! Duck basil. Black Bean shrimp. Chili fried rice with BIG chunks of chicken.  Great atmosphere. A real find"}
{"text":"I used to come here often, that is before I found a new fave, (we won't say any names). The food here is excellent, but the portions are kinda on the small side, considering the price, you can definitely get the same quality, and bigger portions at other locations. The servers are always pleasant and the atmosphere is really nice compared to other Thai restaurants around town. I usually come for a couple of items on the menu only. I'm big on consistency, and that's what brings me back. The yen ta fo rocks!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of thai food! this has a great atmosphere with beautiful decor. The appetizers were great however I was a little dissapointed in my pad thai noodles. the beef wasnt as tender as i would have liked. overall it was a pleasant experience with great customer service and a great menu! PLEASE DO TRY THE MANGO BELLINI IT WAS AMAZING!!! :)"}
{"text":"Great place, highly recommended! I haven't had a bad dish here yet."}
{"text":"Ambiance and decor = 4 stars Customer service in regards to greeting with a smile when people entered = 4 stars Food: Beef Satay, Tom Ka Shrimp, Pad Thai w/ chicken, Pad See Ew with beef, Eggplant & tofu, Crab fried rice was ok = 3 stars.  Mediocre at best. Take out service = 1 star or ZERO if Yelp's rating had \"zero\"!    When the order was taken over the phone, we were told it would be ready in 15 min.  We even arrived nearly a half an hour after our order was placed.   AND when we got there we still waited another  ~25min.  Why tell people the food will be ready at a certain time... and then make them wait longer than ~10min??? The hostess smiled and blamed the soup for taking so long... well she should have told us it would be ready in ~45min and not in ~15.  My brother did say they apologized for the wait.  Well thankfully I don't live in Vegas, so I won't have to experience this again any time soon."}
{"text":"We used to go here a lot and now we're usually doing take out. The food is amazing and the service always great. I tried all the Curries and they're all happening, my lady loves their Pad Thai and I'm always happy to try some of it. It's amazing as well. We're regulars."}
{"text":"Well alrighty then Pin kaow has been Yelped already. As it should be.  Just had a lunch at #1 (Rainbow @ Lake Mead) there are 3 locations.  Welp Yelp. This will be the Thai place in Las Vegas I regular at. So glad to have been turned onto them!!  I do recognize it's popularity. And will expect to wait a tad sometimes for a table. Looks like a Take-Out pick up counter (which is off to the right towards the back) does a brisk business!  Only 4 Stars?  Too many Cell Phones! What is with this town? (But I digress)  Perfect.... Service. Decor. Portions. Price. Spice. And they Bless you on your departing. I guess thats what it is. Hands together and they bow to you graciously. Very kind gesture.  The pending \"ring of fire\" I'm sure is so worth it following each visit here. Yes I like it spicy.  11am - 10pm everyday.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow on Eastern is my favorite place to go when I'm craving Thai food. The service is always friendly and fast. Even pick-up for a to-go order is quick, which is a perfect option when coming home from a long day at work. I've yet to try their delivery option, but I will in the future. I definitely recommend trying their spring rolls, but the entire menu features great food."}
{"text":"I love their food, I go there about 2 to 3 times a week.  My favorite now is the Chicken Red Curry or Spicy Basil Chicken plus the Thai Tea is great.  I would highy recommend them."}
{"text":"I have to say that I think I am over it.  I am from LA originally, and maybe I have just been spoiled by really good and cheap Thai food. When I moved to Vegas, this was my go to Thai spot, partly because someone recommended it and partly because there was not much else to choose from in our area.  Pin Kaow has some decent tasting food, but my biggest problem is that I feel like the portion sizes are getting smaller, and it is just not worth the price."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the Nam Kao Todd Salad!  Wow!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  One of my two (Lotus of Siam, the other) favorite Thai places in the whole city.  Food is tasty and beautifully prepared.  They do spice on a 1-10 scale and are right on the money.  Not like others where the spices are subtle, here a 7 in spice is solid and did an 8 once and ate t but it was very much at that edge.  Lunch specials are awesome.  Its sister restaurant on Eastern has skimpier portions and is good but not great.    Almost every dish Ive eaten there has been spot on."}
{"text":"My sons and I usually come here for birthday lunches because the food is generally superb, the place is classy, and the young servers are respectful, friendly, and generally attentive (I'm talking about the Eastern Avenue branch; I've been to the South Rainbow/Robindale branch one time for dinner and I didn't see the same level of enthusiastic customer service there).  We especially like the Seafood Surprise (seafood with ginger, baby corn, and red bell pepper in a Thai spicy sauce), curries (we've tried the duck and catfish curries so far), \"Gulf of Thailand\" (stir-fried seafood and spices in a hot clay pot), and combination fried rice (with shrimp, chicken, beef, and pork). I didn't find the Pork Ginger dish as special as the other items.  The food can be really spicy so be careful how you order. They give you a 10-point choice scale and Level 2 is plenty spicy for us. Level 1 is my personal choice.  We always return the servers' friendliness and respect with a heartfelt \"khaap khun\" (thank you in Thai) which never fails to elicit a warm smile."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in town. Delicious and has good price. atmosphere is real cozy and cool. service is great too."}
{"text":"The food, service, and price was great. As a newbie to Thai food, so far this is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I give one star for the servers being kind.  We both hated our dinner.  Never going back!  Only a few customer there.  Food was cold and not high quality.   Our expensive  dishes came out Cold?! After like 5 minutes.  What do they just attempt to heat your food.  Place is not cheap at all! Many choices to pick in Vegas for Asian food, go try one of those."}
{"text":"This is my first time on this restaurant it's a little pricey I thought it would be good but I was wrong, the rice was old and I ask for spicy but didn't came out what I wanted , I'm disappointed with the food I wouldn't go back there again"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely great and so is the service, however, I have had to quit dining at Pin Kaow due to the burning of incense in their restaurant at Rainbow and Lake Mead .  For those who have a sensitivity to fragrances you will be immediately hit by strong incense the moment you open the door.  If you have an issue with scented products I would advise you don't eat at this restaurant, do take out instead, they will bring it to you outside if you ask.  It would be so nice if they quit burning incense so everyone could dine inside."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Eggplant with tofu spice level 2 was delicious. The hell curry did not disappoint. High octane heat didn't mask the flavors. I think they were worried about me ordering #9 heat level because 3 different staff checked on me during our meal."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant the inside is very calming and lots of booths which I love! The lighting is very calm and not so bright inside. The service here is very great and the waitress was very helpful explaining the menu to me since I'm vegan, and she was very informative of how the food is cooked & what my options are. Great environment I will be back very soon !"}
{"text":"Today is my second time to come here. We  ordered dinner size pineapple fried rice and red curry with regular tofu, asking for median spicy. The dishes taste very fresh, fried rice is not greasy, curry is light sweet which is perfect for me. We two girls finished both of them, too full! Plus I like the interior design of this place, even the restroom is nice too.   Last time I tried the pad see ew here, which is good too. But I like the red curry more."}
{"text":"The place itself is super cute and the staff is amazingly sweet! The food is very good, small portions, but the price isn't that expensive. Would definitely recommend!!! The crab ragoons are amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been very sick lately & eating Thai food really hits the spot. This is my second time at Pinkaow & I got take out this time. My takeout was ready when I got there. Food is flawless, no complaints about this place.  Staff is extremely friendly. Thanks guys! Will be returning :)"}
{"text":"Sent my food back literally four times due to lack of spice and temperature. I unequivocally made it clear how sick I'm feeling and how hot I needed my soup to help clear my throat. I feel I was the product of shift change and them stereotyping white people. Our second waiter never returned and I had to get the manager involved who still couldn't get the cook to heat my soup up to boiling. I am so shocked and disappointed giving the fact that I was really looking forward to this to help with my cold. :/"}
{"text":"I love the chili mint noodles here.  The masaman and panang curries are excellent too.  I normally finish off the meal with some coconut ice cream.  The decor is nice, wait staff is quick and attentive (though some don't speak english well), and prices are reasonable.  Pin Kaow is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years now. The servers are always so friendly and the food has always been great! I recommend asking what's in a dish before ordering, because with Thai food you always run the risk of getting some sort of fish sauce in it (totally understandable). Any of the vegetarian options can be made vegan if you ask to omit the egg. I always get the tofu pad thai with fried tofu and no egg. So good! And with my dairy-consuming friends, they always obsess over the Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is yummy! Quick and friendly service. Wish they gave you bigger servings of rice, but other wise, this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH! Awesome food! Incredible and personal service. It is like going to a 5 star restaurant but without the high cost. They greet you with a smile, get to know you and provide an outstanding experience for guests. This was my first visit and we will be back again and again! The quality of the meal was better than any Thai restaurant that I have visited before.   The Phad Thai with Salmon and Spicy Basil were cooked to perfection. The spring rolls were so hot and so fresh that we had to wait to dive in!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to spot, but quality and portions have gone down while price seemed to have gone up! There are so many other options, better ones, in the area."}
{"text":"I've come here a dozen times when in town for business and it is always good. Today I had the special roast duck pad Thai - great! Lots of duck and great noodles. Judging over a couple years, they have consistently good quality and service."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! A little pricey for the portion sizes but other than that it would get 5 stars! Service is great, food is great and the atmosphere is beautiful!"}
{"text":"We were just looking for some healthy Asian food to eat not too far off the freeway. But (and I say this having lived in Thailand for a few years) I will be back. The red curry and phad Thai were fabulous, chicken-rice soup solid and service wonderful. Had lunch, so dinner will have to be next"}
{"text":"Bad Customer service food quality not that great. Paid for my meal received a dollar ripped in half. I asked for another dollar. The waitress brought me back a dollar of pennies and nickels. Not worth the price you pay compared to Siam Thai kitchen which is much better quality and price. ."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. we ordered the rad na beef, yen ta fo seafood, and beef namtok salad. The salad was very flavorful and spicy. We ordered it a spice number 10, but it wasn't that bad. Service was good and quick. Prices were comparable to other Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times before this is my 1st time reviewing it. I took my friend with me, it was her 1st time trying out real thai food. They have awesome curries, like avocado curry (I think this was in the special menu). I had the yellow curry because it's my favorite. Their thai tea is the best because of the slushy ice on it. The owner/manager went around making sure all the guests were happy with their meal and services. Overall everything was amazing, we loved it."}
{"text":"Service: bad, never checked on the table, only refilled water once I asked, never had the same server (one that sat us, one that took drink orders, one that took food order, one that brought the food, and one the brought the check), forgot to bring us one plate. Food: bland, had no flavor at all, food was over cooked.  Overall, worst Thai food I've had"}
{"text":"The Place: Clean, Casual, Nice Decor The Service: Helpful, Quick, Friendly  The Food: Variety, Great Food, Good Sized Portions  I've eaten here MANY times and have had nothing but Great Experiences.  The Green Curry, Pineapple Fried Rice are my 2 favorites here. Haven't found a better Thai place in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is some outstanding food! We LOVE the yellow curry and the Pad Thai noodles, so we always order the same thing, as well as crab Rangoon. The place is spotless and clean, the decor is nice and warm, and the service is OUTSTANDING. Every time I mention this place to my girlfriend, the answer is always YES!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Not much I don't like but the beef jerky is amazing and so is the chicken mint dish."}
{"text":"3 of us came here on halloween night. I personally enjoyed the live music, it was exotic, mellow and not too loud. As soon as we opened the door, we were greeted by this lady who was nicely dressed in traditional thai clothing. Inside was clean and welcoming. I recall we were the only customers there that time, but oh well, it was sunday, this restaurant is located in Henderson and everyone in Vegas must have been busy partying @ the strip that night.    When I sat down, I wasn't so hungry, so I was going to only eat papaya salad, but I changed my mind when I look the menu because I found the whole fried red snapper, and I couldn't resist it. (Who can? especially when you're from Asia) Usually, whole fried fish would cost min $50 if you are to order it at those chinese restaurants on the strip, but here, it was reasonably priced and I paid only $20. Ha! The fish was perfectly cooked, inside was steamy and didn't stink at all (it happens sometimes when you don't prepare it well). The meat was firm, and outside was crispy, crunchy, and drenched in spicy tangy sauce. It was not oily though. I ate tails and small bones too... I asked her to prepare it pretty spicy, and they did it just the way I liked it.   I also ordered Papaya salad which was like $9.00 and it wasn't a disappointment, but I've had something better for this price before. As for duck curry, meat was very tender and surprisingly not too oily. It was kinda sweet because of the pineapples they put in. This one was $13 and it's worth the repeat.   Next time, I'd like to try couple different soup :)"}
{"text":"It's ok.  Not as authentic as I would like it to be.  The spicy is not as spicy as a real Thai restaurant would have it.  Maybe they Americanize it too much? Desserts are fun though."}
{"text":"It is with sadness that I write this review since we love Pinkaow food!   What should have been a pleasant dinner for two turned into a real disappointment!  First, let me say we are Pinkaow lovers, and usually enjoy their restaurant very much.  I decided to order a martini from their specialty menu and that is where the problem started.  I am a modest drinker and occasionally have a drink to celebrate a landmark of epic proportions like cleaning the garage!!!   Hey, we all celebrate, right??!  My mango martini arrived and it was all Mango juice!    No vodka at all.   I used to be a bartender, so don't fool me!    I asked our server if it was possible that the bartender forgot the vodka......he then did something that really irritated me....he asked the bartender to tell me she added the vodka and challenged me!    What????    Believe me, this has only happened one other time in my life.   I'm 65 folks, and have one or two drinks a week so this was truly insulting to me!  I suggest, if you go to this restaurant, don't order mixed drinks!!!   You will truly be disappointed!  Next time, if there is a next time, I'll order wine with dinner!"}
{"text":"better than the strip! eggplant is my favorite dish... so tasty! spices are mixed so well ;)"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the Pad Tai (7 level hot) and it was awesome.  I was so impressed I recommended this place to some friends.  I came back within 2 days and the service was great and food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Bar none the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. They have excellent costumer service and even better dishes. They put you in charge for the spiciness level of your meal (order more than a 6 and you will be reaching for multiple water sips). My favorite dishes are Tom Yum Goong and Pad Thai Chicken Noodles. You will get to know that I love spice and this place defiantly brings it!"}
{"text":"I always loved this restaurant but moved out of the area & would return a few times but I went today for the first time for their lunch special & was quite disappointed! Portions were so small. There were maybe 2 pieces of small, very dry overcooked chicken. Taste was bland. I don't know if I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"This a wonderful family staple for us. The food is always delicious, every time we come ... which is at least one a week. The service is quick and friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed with half tone lighting and its dark wood tones with rich carved accents.  They have a compilation of booths and tables to accommodate any size party. They also have an outdoor patio when the weather allows which has plants, misters and a relaxing water feature. Nice place to hang out with a group of friends and take time to enjoy each others company and catch up. They have a happy hour each afternoon with drink and food specials. The bar is fully stocked and I have never ordered a drink they could not fulfill.   We order nearly the same meal each time we come and have it served family style. They have always been very helpful in customizing an order for spiciness level and personal likes / dislikes. We order:  War Wonton Soup Hotpot - $10.95 Combination Fried Rice - $14.95 Lemon Chicken - $10.95 Spicy Basil with Pork - $10.95 Green Curry w chicken - $11.95 Pad See Ew w chicken - $10.95   This comfortably feeds my family of four (2 HUNGRY teenage boys, one hardworking husband and me) .... OCCASIONALLY we will have very valuable leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Thai food, though my husband has eaten it many times before.  We were told to try this restaurant by my sister (who is a picky eater) and her husband.  It was delicious! I had the Pad See Ew and it was so delicious.  I loved the thick noodles, broccoli, and chicken.  My husband ordered the Pad Thai and like it.  He loves very spicy food so he tried an 8/10 but says he will get a 10/10 next time.  The service was good as well and for 2pm on a Sunday afternoon, there were plenty of people eating there.  One star down for the expensive $10 app we ordered.  It was some kind of shrimp/crap friend roll, which consisted of 4 super skinny pieces.  Not worth it, but overall we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The place and decor is surprising. The food was amazing. Had the grilled salmon pad thai. It's a must have. The prices were less than what I would've paid.  Service was also very good. I couldn't finish my drink before I was already getting a refill. Definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place.  The service is always amazing, the food is consistently delicious.  It is my favorite Thai restaurant.  I recommend the crab rangoons, beef jerky, and green curry!"}
{"text":"So yum!! A great place for us and close to home. Love the food and atmosphere. Ask for it extra Thai spicy, f you can handle it."}
{"text":"The Lake Mead/Rainbow location is the best. The staff is always friendly even when they are slammed. I can't think of a thing I've tried and didn't like. My husband likes really spicy food but me, not so much. I love that we can customize how spicy our dishes are with a number 1-10. He always gets 7 spice and I get 2.   Favorites when dining in are the silver noodle soup, shrimp and cream cheese tempura, pad see ew, pad woon sen, and black bean scallop.   We've ordered the silver noodle soup to go a few times and each time it was mostly broth so we don't bother doing that any more."}
{"text":"Good thai food. I really liked the Restaurant's atmosphere and service. I ordered the special, soft crab with basil sauce. It was amazing...i think this is worth the $13. Will go again, for sure."}
{"text":"Larb smelled off and treated like dust.  Soup was OK, music was annoying saxophone elevator stuff.  Staff was nice, but not coming back."}
{"text":"Good: Ambiance is superior to any other medium range Thai restaurants in town.  Greeter, Seater, and Waiters- they all look and they all behave Thai.  You will feel the ethnicity in their service.  I cannot compare and grade food to real Thai food only because I'm neither of Thai-origin nor I've traveled to Thailand before.  Having said that, the food I've ordered at Pin Kaow was cooked to my liking and it tasted good.  No complaints there.  Bad: There isn't anything that I would complain about.   Bottom line: I'm very impressed with this place that I will definitely go back to this place more than few times in the near future."}
{"text":"Vegas doesn't have much to offer in the way of food, except on the strip. Who wants to go to the strip every night for a meal? This place is amazing. Definitely the best Thai food I have ever had. Every time I walk out of there I just rave about how amazing my meal was. The papaya salad and the Panang chicken are to die for. The service is awesome and the decor is really nice. This is a must check out in Vegas."}
{"text":"This time I tried pan see eew with tofu and it was pretty good. a bit greasy but good.  I guess I have to factor in the fact that I had not eaten all day so everything tasted good at this point. D had basil chicken and it was ok. the thai iced coffee was good.  our server was quite busy and though she did not come back to check how everything was, she was around to bring us hot sauce when we needed it."}
{"text":"Ahh Pin Kaow. Now I have been going to Pin Kaow for years and the customer service has always been a hit and miss.  The food though always satisfactory.  We visited Friday night with the wonton soup hotpot in mind....because I had been sick I thought that the soup would be good for my sore throat.  We did call ahead.  Alway recommended because this place gets busy.  It always seems to have people waiting outside on the weekends.  When we got there we were seated almost immediately even though alot of people were waiting-thats why I recommend the call ahead.  We ordered the wonton soup hot pot.  If you havent had the hot pot before it is a pot with a hole in the middle where they light a running flame.  I would say its for two people but probably could feed four.  The first time I had this I was so impressed.  It just sets an ambiance...an experience.  You definitely must try it.  For our entrees we ordered the Chicken Pad Thai.  Probably the best I have ever had that I order it everytime I come here.  I order the spicy at an 8 or 9 and never seems too spicy to eat.  Especially if my BF can eat it.  He ordered the mongolian beef.  It is always great too.  It is different from other mongolian beefs I have had....the sauce is more like a gravy consistency.  But it is good.  All paired off with a glass of chardonney and the night was bliss.   This is a great place for a date, for a group, for a celebration.  It is a Thai experience.  So if you are trying to impress someone it would be a good spot to take them.  Like I said the service is hit and miss.  I do recommend the take out.  They have a little section in the back where they do the to-go orders and I have never had a problem.  In and out.  Food is just as good as eating in.  This place isnt very close to home but I will drive for the occasional Thai fix! ;)"}
{"text":"As I originally predicted, we have become regulars. I need to try more items on the menu but just can't get enough of the Chili Mint Noodles. Quality and service remain top notch. I might as well just setup direct deposit because they get a slice of my pay check each month."}
{"text":"Is it me or has the quality of food gone down? I  have been going to Pin Kaow for years and it was one of my favorite thai restaurants because of it's authenticity. However, I recently went after a very long time and I was so disappointed in the food. I feel like the food is not authentic and flavorous as it use to be. The food was just so bland and lacked the quality it use to have. Before, Pin Kaow was the best thai restaurant in Vegas, but I don't think that is true anymore. Hopefully I'll find one that I enjoy like I did with Pin Kaow when it use to be really good."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of all time! This is the first place I recommend to take family and friends when they are in town. I have celebrated many events and achievements here and will continue to for many years to come. A very friendly and attentive staff, also quite accommodating. The food is never too greasy and every dish I have ever tried is never disappointing. My go to meals are Pad Woon Sen, Pad Thai, and Red Pineapple Curry. You cannot beat their amazing lunch special deals and portions. Every time I fly back into town, they are my first stop to remind me of home- literally calling a to go order in the car from the airport. I very rarely give 5 star reviews but Pin Kaow is worth every star. The dinner atmosphere and price is a must try too. Thank you for staying amazing even after you franchised."}
{"text":"I love love love this place ! I'm not a big thai food person , but I love this place. I love all the employees they are very friendly , service has always been great. The food is delicious , one thing about thai food is that I have sensitive taste buds so we been to a few other places but by far this is the best because it's still very flavorful without being overwhelming . I love the beef thai salad it's my favorite and the best I've had . They have a pretty big menu for those who like to taste different stuff. I'm a wimp so I normally get like a 3 spice hahaha had 9 before big mistake it sets my mouth on fire be careful with the spice I recommend going with a low spice and just asking for a spice rack! Anyways happy dinning to all , highly recommend this place (;"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. I believe they have the best Thai food consistently above all others. It's always fresh and tastes great! I have never received an attitude from the employees. The girls there are so polite. I really appreciate that. My favorite is the Larb salad. We have tried everything on the menu and can say we have not been disappointed. The place doesn't look like much on the exterior however is really nice on the inside. We have eaten at dozens of Thai places and this one is by far the best. I guess that's why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. I liked the pad thai. On par with lotus. Definitely the best Thai restaurant I've had in north las Vegas so far. Side note: the service was too good that they took my green curry before I finished off the sauce."}
{"text":"The food was alright. It was not busy at all and our appetizer took about 20 minutes to come out. Then our entrees took another 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"Just went for the first time.  Food was decent, my problem was with the \"experience\".... when we walked in  we asked for a patio table (sign out front advertised nice patio seating) because it was a beautiful afternoon.  The hostess told us she was the only server so patio wouldn't be very convenient.  Okay, just seat us in the restaurant....  Our service was actually great, but we had 4-5 people checking on us (with only two other tables occupied... it was not crowded AT ALL).  Why couldn't we be  seated on the patio as we requested?  There seemed to be plenty of help, not short staffed at all.    Although we missed out on a beautiful patio dining experience in great weather, the food was acceptable."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant.  Better than most Thai restaurants that I have been to.    Very good food.  Their Panang curry is the best I've had.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Good stuff Satisfied  Delicious curry chicken Nice ambience Friendly stuff"}
{"text":"My all-time favorite Thai place in Las Vegas.  I've been eating here for over 10 years, I have never been disappointed! I love the chili made noodles with fried tofu and the crab rangoon. Their soup is also absolutely delicious! Super fast delivery, and great service in house!"}
{"text":"I guess I will write reviews of places I really like too because I think some of my reviews are being Yelp \"filtered\".  I used to like this place, the food and the service.  The food is okay.  I have had better thai food however this is a convenient location for me.    The last 2 times I have been in I have been ignored for a while by service.  I am sure it wasn't on purpose but when 2 tables are seated after me and served drinks and their appetizers before the server acknowledges me, that is a problem.    The first time I walked out, the second time I waived my hands in the air to make sure to get their attention.  We sat at the same table both times, it could be a cursed table.  The hostess is always very sweet and friendly.  However, I won't be back unless friends have a burning desire to go.  I heard a new thai restaurant opened that is even closer to where I live.  I will give that a go!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The service is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable for all that you get!!  I recently moved to Las Vegas and I had never had Thai food before but I am so glad I checked this place out!!  The Tofu soup and the all the garlic dishes are really good!!  My daughter had the garlic chicken and I have tried both the garlic beef and pork.   I have also tried one of the noodle dishes which was out of this world!   I was so pleased w/this place I recently brought my son and daughter in law when they came to visit and they enjoyed as well and Thanked us for treating them to such a great meal!!   We especially love the fact the food can be made as spicy or not as you like!!   I only wish I could rate this place 10 stars because it really was that great experience and we will continue to frequent this restaurant!!  :)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over a decade. This place is my jam! They have The best pineapple fried rice in the world! You must try it at least once. Atmosphere is nice too. If you like Thai food this is the place for you in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some thai food. We ordered a pad thai, salmon green curry, and some crispy crab rolls. Everything was very delicious and well prepared. We'll probably go for a yellow curry next time. They also offer a wide range of spices for each persons tastes.   Definitely would recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Ordered last night 2 fried rice, quantity Was very less, ordered 2 curries, Panang and RedCurry, both were same no difference whatsoever, spicy level we requested was 8/10 & literally everything was sweet, this will be last time, they suck! Even their delivery boxes are cheap, Archi Thai is the place, even though far, that's the place we will go when Thai."}
{"text":"I just ordered the chicken Pad Thai (no bean sprouts), and a bowl of shrimp Tom-Kha for delivery. The food was exceptionally well favored, even though I ordered spiciness of zero.  The soup was smooth, and coconut milk creamy with a light undertone of lemon grass.  The mushrooms in the soup were fresh and plentiful, along with the shrimp.  I loved the thin crispy, yet tender chicken slices in the Pad Thai. The rice noodles had a nice balance of sweet and sour, and were very light.  I was altogether impressed with the service over the phone (since I called back, and changed my item selection after I already place an order for mango sticky rice).  Also, I was glad to see that they included utensils and napkins, thus saving me from washing additional dishes. If you like a light (non-greasy or overbearing), and fresh Thai flavor this is the place to go.  I will most definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"The food here was good. But I will look for another place for Thai food. I ate here for the first time about a year ago & I was really impressed by the taste. I could only eat half of the Pad Thai I ordered, so I had them box it up for me to go. I took it home & ate the rest of it the next evening for dinner. As I was eating, I bit something really hard. I spit it out & I noticed it was a small diamond! It chipped my tooth a little bit. I was shocked & disgusted. So I didn't go back. Well, a little over a year later I thought I would try it again & shrugged the first encounter off as a freak accident. I ate there a couple times with no problem, food was very good. Well I ordered take-out from them a couple weeks ago (Pad Thai again) And I was eating it & AGAIN bit in to something hard. So I spit it out. This time it was a broken piece of a plate!! I have no clue WHY I keep finding things in my food! It is disgusting & the cooks need to pay better attention when they are cooking. I will NOT be going back here again even though I like the food. The act of eating something & finding a foreign object in your mouth is beyond acceptable. Do not go here. If it has happened to me TWICE. I am sure it has happened to many other people. I chew my food really good before I swallow & some people who eat faster might have swallowed these items without knowing. Gross."}
{"text":"On the plus side the dishes are very flavorful and the staff is pleasant. They have a mint duck that is not on the menu that is delicious.  Staff is friendly and the interior of the restaurant is delightful and comfortable.  On the down side the amount of meat placed in the dishes is stingy to the point my friends and I went to 168 for a whole duck and picked dishes from here as sides. For example the tom yung koong they put 8 shrimp which sounds like a lot but really isn't and if you want more they charge $1.50 per shrimp. They won't even add extra duck to any of the duck orders. The pork fried rice had less than 1 ounce of pork in it. At that rate what's the point of calling it pork or chicken or whatever meat you get in the dish because there is barely any meat.   That's why this deserves 3 stars instead of 4. If you are a meat eater don't expect to get much from this place; however if you are fine with that then expect a flavorful experience."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day and I was so surprised at how delicious it was!   We ordered the pad Thai, pad se ew, and fried rice and everything was so yummy! Pad Thai had just the right amount of spice, we had 4 and 6. The pad se ew was so flavorful and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. And the fried rice was so fresh and perfect!  The service was also so great! They were so nice and always coming back to check on us. We will definitely be back again, again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Atmosphere is a little dark and outdated though. Delivery always takes over an hour!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars.   I went back today to give them another try. The service was so disgusting I walked out. (Before getting my food).   So disgusted by them. BEWARE. You will get treated like absolute shit."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is great! Their peach sangria is a must try!! The serving size is just not as much compared to other Thai. Papaya salad with soft shell crab is really good too!!"}
{"text":"Used to be really good! I wonder if Pa Maew is still in the kitchen. So disappointed, but was in the area after a campaign event, so decided to stop by.  We saw CafeZupas on the way and lamented not going later  The larb...too sad to even count on. Ended up taking it home, only because I dont like wasting food. Anyways, took it home and added the missing mint, extra cilantro, and roasted ground rice that every good Thai larb dish has.  I'm always weary of Thai places that are \"too-Thai \" the ambience, the servers in Thai silk dresses. In Thailand they don't even dress like that except on marriage or a special day. Definitely not at a restaurant. The tamarind/cashew shrimp was palatable.  Not sure how much tamarind was in at all, but sounded good.  I spoke Thai to the server, AFTER the food was served . I don't look Thai at all, so maybe it was my kind way of saying \" Did you really just try to serve me this?\" Usually speaking Thai to the server is a prerequisite before ordering. To let them write the order in \" Thai style for Thai person\".........   I guess it was my fault for being served saut√©ed hamburger meat with minor seasonings.   You lost your touch Pinkaow. I hope you get it back so we can make this place our top Friday night dinner spot like we did, before you became 3 locations........  Mai Pen Rai. This review is for original on Rainbow/LakeMead"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst take out restaurants for Thai food. I am very disappointed with my hour and a half delivery time when I have ordered from this restaurant at least once monthly for the last two years. On top of the cold food I was very disappointed when I spoke to the owner who offered me a $10 credit only. I will never call them again, sadly."}
{"text":"Great lunch with my baby had a good time good food and I like that it's right down the block from my house"}
{"text":"Since we just moved into the area thought we would give Pinkaow a try. Glad we did, food and service was excellent! We will be back, if nothing else for the the crispy crab roll...yummy!!"}
{"text":"The Masaman  curry with potatoes was excellent over plain white rice. My wife had it over fried rice, and it was an even better savory taste. The dining room ambiance was very nice with artfully wood-carved walls and"}
{"text":"I've been to this particular location many times over the past couple of years. I'm sad to say the quality of their food is deteriorating and their customer service is sub par. The last few times I've been there I've noticed the service was extra bad: our food wasn't cooked properly, staff didn't check on us, instead we had to flag them down to get our order taken. We kept going back because it was the only Thai food place around the area that we knew of.   Today I walked in to pick up an order. I've done this many times using my boyfriend's debit card without an issue. On this occasion the lady ringing me up, which I believe was a manager, asked to see my ID. I kindly told her that the debit card didn't belong to me, that it belonged to my boyfriend. She asked me for his ID, I repeated my self and added that I didn't have his ID. She stared at me blankly for a few seconds then told me she couldn't take the card. As I was telling her that I've been there many times to pick up orders using that card a waitress came over, interrupted me mid-sentence and told me, \"We just changed our policy, it's a new policy!\" and she walked away. I'm not sure why she felt the need to interrupt me mid-sentence and talk to me in a rude tone. It's not like I was being rude or making a scene. There's a fairly quiet ambiance in this restaurant so I know to keep my tone down. And I wasn't being rude at all. I was going to ask if they could save my order so I could go get cash and come back but after the way the waitress spoke to me, I just had it. I said thank you and left.   I vow never to go back. The service and quality keep going down but the prices stay the same, and they are pricey. I was starving when I got home. Then I remembered there's a place down the road from my house called Sakun Thai, we went there instead and it was GREAT! Food was delicious, the prices we're very inexpensive and all of the staff we interacted with was really friendly. So glad we decided to try out this other place, they totally turned my day around."}
{"text":"I am a very big Pin Kao fan for the restaurant on Lake Mead and Rainbow.  I have been going there for years and the food and service there is 5 stars.  I recently moved to the Henderson area and I have now tried the Eastern location twice.  I have to say out of pure dissapointment that the food was awful.  I don't understand it!!!.  I did a to-go order for $80 dollars, and EVERYTHING and I mean everything was tasteless and not even spicy which was really strange.  I had a tasteless Duck Curry, a tasteless Pad Thai with chicken, a tasteless seafood coconut, a tasteless house special fried rice and the only thing that had any taste was the Beef Satay (thank goodness).  It had to be the worse meal I have ever had to be called Thai Food.  Every one of these dishes were supposed to be a 7 on the spice scale and they were all bland and like I said .......Tasteless.    I am so sorry to write this, but if I could, I would drive to Lake Mead and Rainbow to get back my old feelings for this restaurant brand.  Please check your kitchen....make sure they can cook and add the taste back to your food or check your cash register to see if your 7's are being printed out in the kitchen as zeros for your orders!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a delightful, welcoming atmosphere and consistently serves quality food.  The wait staff is always friendly and the service is above average. It has been our 'go to' restaurant for years and never disappoints.  From the decor to the traditional garb worn by the wait staff, it's easy to feel like you are eating in Thailand. Whether it's a special celebration or if you're looking for a quiet, charming place to take guests or meet up with friends, consider going to Pin Kaow. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went with my husband and ordered a dish with hotness of a 6 out of 10. I understand Thai food is hot, but this food was unbelievably hot. I couldn't even eat my food. When the server asked how everything was I told her it was too hot for me. She did absolutely nothing but moved on. I've worked in restaurants for over 25 years and the first thing I do is make is make sure everything perfect for the guest, especially if it's not. So, my lunch of rice was good. Would I go back? Not anymore because of customer service."}
{"text":"Good food. Portion size is :/ okay if you order family style, but if you are with people with a hefty appetite order more. Pad Thai is delicious. I highly recommend you order it. Spicy level 5.  Overall it's okay I heard the other locations are better.  I recommend people to try the food it is tasty."}
{"text":"Kind of a strange place.  Very charming decor, friendly and responsive wait staff, but the menu has almost as many Chinese selections as Thai.  When you see \"Chow Mein\" or \"Mixed Chinese Noodles with a Thai Sauce\" on the menu it makes you wonder.  To be fair, they do have a good selection of curries, but the rest of their menu paled in comparison with other Thai places I've visited.  I had the Tom Yum soup, which was simply wonderful and full of lemongrass, mushrooms, and shrimp.  I also had the wide rice noodle with chili, mint, and shrimp (most places call it \"drunken noodles\"), again, very good and the waiter was helpful in guiding me in selecting a \"hot\" level.  I also had a Thai beer and finished the meal with mango and sweet sticky rice was was absolutely fantastic.  The wait staff seemed to light up when you actually ordered Thai specialties.  I would definitely go here again, but just ignore the Chinese food on the menu."}
{"text":"Ok so I give this a four out of five. I was trying so hard to give it a five, but nothing here really blew me out of the water. However this place has good thai food, great service, and a cool atmosphere. I will always come back here and enjoy some curry. This is definitely one of the better ones that I have found around town."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I have a few friends who really like this place so I've tried it a couple of times and I really don't know what to say except, it's just not very good. Their curries are bland and colorless. If I didn't know I ordered the green curry I wouldn't have been able to guess that's what it was, it was nearly white. The tom kha is mediocre.  I can't really put my finger on what it is that's missing from their food but it doesn't have the depth of flavor that I'm used to from places like Komol and Lotus. I want that punch of flavor when I eat Thai food and Pin Kaow just lightly slaps me."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm very particular when it comes to \"Po Tak\" it's a seafood soup but best part it's not so fishy due to its lemon grass that over powers the taste. If you like spicy, be careful there level 5 out of 10. With 0 being no spice to 10 spiciest. Is pretty spicy. & trust me when I can say I can handle spicy, I'm Hispanic lol. There drunken sew ew noodles have such a rich flavor if you like lost of veggies (like me) I'd ask for extra broccoli. On the multiple occasions I've gone thats the only thing I'd change. Majority of what I've had and sampled with my friends is amazing , I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Pin Kaow for a little over a year and I'll tell you it is more like PIN WOW. I don't think I can say it is the most authentic Thai restaurant in the game but I can definitely say it's my personal favorite. I've been here numerous times over the past year or so and I can't stop coming back. My girlfriend and I have always gone to this place and left completely and fully satisfied.  First of all, the services from the staff is great. They have always been more than accommodating and attentive to the point where I feel like I'm being pampered. You never have to ask for a water refill, it's done before you can think otherwise. I've been there at varying hours of the day and I have never not been seated within 5-10 minutes at the most. Brilliant service, by people who seem like they actually enjoy being there.   The food, ahh the food. The most important part of every restaurant, depending on whether or not you're that person that judges places off of the bathroom. I guess, in that case, this place is also pretty delightful. Anyway, my girlfriend and I usually get the same thing so this is my opinion on what we always get. To drink, it's either a a nice cold Chang Beer or the Thai Milk Tea. Both delicious and both delicious. I think I said delicious twice *smugface*  We always order the Chicken Pad Thai, which is probably a stereotypical order at a Thai restaurant but trust me it's delicious. The pad thai is always accompanied by Black Bean Shrimp and the Mongolian Beef. You can choose your spicy level, from 1-10 I believe. I'm extra adventurous and cap out at spice number 5 and it's always just the right amount of spicy. All the entree's come with a side of rice, for you rice fanatics.  The food is decently priced and I've never felt as if I'm stretching my wallet for dinner or lunch. All of that in mind, this is one of my favorite joints in the city. I'd recommend this place to anyone, unless you're a traditional Thai person. Because I have a Thai friend and the only place you can get \"real\" Thai food is \"at my house.\" I've never been invited though, so until that fantasy happens I will continue being a proud and faithful Pin Kaow-er."}
{"text":"This is a Staple!! My go to place when ever I get the Thai itch. Which is pretty often.  My order (with others to share of course) goes something like this... Cucumber salad Beef Satay Tom Yum Koong or Tom Ka Koong with a side of rice Chicken Pad Thai  I have also had and would never turn down Green or Red Curry, and Crab Rangoon.   The quality is ALWAYS consistent as is the Service. I like spicy and usually opt for a 5. Sometimes 6 burns a little on the way out... :)~"}
{"text":"Normally I love this place but lately it seems to be going down in terms of quality. My usual favorite masaman curry now has dry chicken and today we have mango snapper with very unripe and crunchy mango. We did enjoy the avocado curry very much.   We we're not happy, however, to be excited about their special green tea creme brulee that in the end was very overdone, eggy, and tasted like a bag of matcha powder. Not good."}
{"text":"Pinkaow will always bring fond memories of post medical school exams relaxation for my favorite person and I. Our usual dishes are the drunken noodles, green curry, and the thai chili basil dish. The dishes are not too salty (which is a good thing!), but can use a little more spiciness. We also always get the thai iced tea, which does not taste extremely sweet nor does it taste overly diluted. You can really taste the authentic thai tea flavor here! We also love Archi's, but that is a bit of a drive away from us. But in Henderson, Pinkaow is definitely our number one pick!"}
{"text":"I came around dinner time and it's so convenient how Pin Kaow is right next door to Cr√™pes Expectations. The indoor lighting seems a bit dim, but I guess that's how it should be when creating an intimate atmosphere. The entrance is appealing; when you walk in the first thing you will see is a beautiful resemblance of a Thai temple structure with an embed sign that says \"Welcome To Thailand.\" To the left side is a standing menu board with their Special of the Day. There are plenty of seating. You can literally come as a big group or choose a table booth for two.   The Chicken Curry Puff ($7) is a popular item on that list that is a must try. It come as a set of four puff pastry filled with minced chicken, potatoes, curry powder and serve with a sweet cucumber relish. The pastry is so soft and buttery, the chicken curry filling is flavorful, and when you add different spice sauce, it just elevates how good it taste.   For entr√©e I went for the Pineapple Fried Rice ($14.95). I let my server Attaya know that I have sensitivity to heat and didn't want my meal to be too spicy, so she suggest I opt for either 3 or 4 spice level. She even offered to set aside some spicy sauce just in case I need to add more. Also I notice the menu says it has shrimp but that's something I request to omit. Once the Pineapple Fried Rice was ready, it's delivered steaming hot inside a real pineapple. The rice is saut√©ed with fresh cut pineapple chunks mixed with chicken, curry powder, raisins, cashew nuts, scrambled egg, diced onion, tomato, and scallion. The fried rice tastes savory and delicious. I love how both appetizer and entr√©e dish come with a string of fresh carrot, red beet, and garnish with cilantro. It's a nice presentation.   Usually I will go for the Mango Sticky Rice as it has always been a favorite treat. But for this dessert I choose Sweet Sticky Rice with Coconut Ice Cream ($7). The other server Zoey has done such a nice job making a heart shape. The sweet sticky rice is serve with a warm coconut cream and the coconut ice cream is a sweet complement. I can't help but smile every time I get sweet sticky rice, I'm not sure why but this dessert makes me happy.   As for the dining area, it feels romantic. The music sound is soft and you can carry a good conversation with the person next to you. Personally, I enjoy this kind of intimate ambience where the music flows calmly and it's just soothing to listen to. They were playing a slow tempo acoustic of \"Dancing In The Dark\" followed by a duet version of \"Despacito,\" and it is just lovely to hear. Overall the food presentation, earthy d√©cor, and the nice personal touch in service is outstanding. The people are so courteous and the meal taste wonderful. I am definitely returning to try new things on the menu."}
{"text":"Good vibe and tasty Thai food. The pad Thai was a lil on the sweet side for my liking. But the avocado curry is super good. Order the pineapple fried rice with chicken. So much flavor! Also the Thai tea to chug your food down. Decent price for a monthly date night. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Notwithstanding a previous review, I do go to \"10\" here...but my taste buds are probably a bit numbed by cigars. Pin-Kaow is a much better than average Thai venue -- the food's great at both lunch and dinner...best of all, it's reasonable."}
{"text":"Good service phad Thai so so at best Archis is way better"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Thai restaurant that I've been to here in Las Vegas. It's right off of Lake Mead and N Rainbow. The atmosphere and decor are very good. The good taste great every time I've been there. \"5\" is medium but it's still pretty spicy so be careful. The service is awesome. This is a must go if you love good Thai food. Price is a little high compared to other Thai places. If they had bigger portions than they would be the best in town. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Just OK...My table was literally right by the front door...The day I was there it was windy and my napkins and everything else was across the room...I little pricey as well. Parking in that parking lot was murder...Every spot was labeled for a particular business, and then threatens to tow you if you park in the wrong spot (w/surveillance)...The food was just OK..."}
{"text":"Terrific food and service. The satay is some of the best I've ever had. My family is from Indonesia so I know my satay!  If you arrive when they open just be prepared for strong incense smell. It was so strong we had to be seated outside. Inside are tables with armless chairs. Outside are tables with chairs with arms.  They have a great selection of alcoholic drinks. Lunch menu is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I ate this food last monday to go. Food was pretty good. You just need to know what to order and how spicy you want it on a 10 scale. I enjoyed their crab ragoon which was pretty big in size. and this dish that is similar to pad thai, drunken noodles?, was really good, and of course, other entrees. The first time my boyfriend and i dined here we weren't too happy, but now that we know what to order, I would recommend this place. Food can get a bit pricey. Like the crab ragoon was 10 bucks and you only get four, but it's so good you would want more."}
{"text":"This place gets very busy on weekend. Average wait time is 30 minutes to an hour depending on the size of your party. The ambience is cozy and sort of romantic, good for a date or family dinner. The service was also good. They were nice and attentive. I had papaya salad, tom yum soup, chicken pad prik king and shrimp pad thai. I got spice level 6 for all of them and it's pretty mild; some didn't taste spicy at all. Besides the pad thai being a little too sweet, the rest of the food was pretty decent, definitely above average but not the best Thai food I've had."}
{"text":"Having frequented Pin Kaow a few times and enjoy the pad Thai I suggested this place for an early dinner. It was 5pm on a Saturday and there was only one other table (appox 5 people). The hostess came right up and greeted us and sat us at a booth. Then we waited... And waited... And waited. My boyfriend could see servers walking by yet no one came over. After sitting there for at least 10 minutes, we saw another couple walk in. The hostess immediately greeted them. Extremely frustrated, we walked out.  It is a shame, the food is good but the service was ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Awesome place  Amazing food Excellent service  Clean and well setup place Prices are not bad. Chicken wings are power."}
{"text":"My kids love to come here every time we visit Vegas. We order the crab fried rice, pad Thai (chicken & shrimp) pad see ew, sticky rice & beef jerky, and tom yum soup  a lot of flavor. The restaurant is a good size but if you come in a large party either call ahead or come early. It's def worth our wait."}
{"text":"Very sad! Maybe I ordered the wrong item as it is Chinese not Thai but it was pathetic . Wor won ton $12 for 2 shrimps 2 pieces of pork some chicken and bok Choy I sent it back telling them it had nothing in it , and I got it back w more cabbage . Dishwater Tea in a mug w a bag!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Can't say enough great things! Love the decor, love the Tom Kai kon! - chicken coconut soup! One of my fav places in vegas! I must say though-The location on Rainbow is odd... The location in Henderson on eastern is much nicer."}
{"text":"First visit a few weeks ago was amazing. Friendly fast service. We ordered massaman curry and yellow curry, both with chicken. They were both awesome.  Returned tonight and tried the avocado curry. It was as good if not better than the yellow curry last time.  If you are in the mood for Thai, this is the place."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean Thai place.  They have a great outdoor eating patio, which is private and secluded.  We shared the duck fried rice and the pumpkin curry.  Both dishes were nicely presented and flavourful.  Spice level 1-10 and we settled on 5 ( could have been spiced higher) but it was good."}
{"text":"The food is always decent and we've had many things on the menu here. The Panang is especially good.   However, after a recent to-go purchase, we were extremely disappointed by the portion size.  We have gone to eat there as a family many times and never really take any food home as leftovers the way we do at a couple other Thai restaurants. The pretty presentation distracts you from realizing just how little food you are actually getting for your money.   Side note: the yellow curry in was very liquid-like and not thick and creamy the way we are accustomed to.  Time to say goodbye for a while I think. Overall: meh."}
{"text":"I eat here quite often, when you first walk in the ambience is nice with Thai decor.  You will be greeted by a warm friendly face at the hostess stand. Being surrounded by imported teak wood furnishing will make you feel as if you are in Thailand . They have incredible lunch specials for $7.95 & $8.95. The cuisine is always fresh and very tasty. It arrives at the table without a long wait and the service is excellent. Don't forget to have the sticky mango rice dessert. Absolutely delicious ."}
{"text":"This is also one of the good Thai restaurants in town. The flavor is good but some entree is a bit salty for me. Let them know to go easy on salt if you're salt sensitive. The portions are good and the waiters are quite nice."}
{"text":"Always great and consistent in food and service! The food flavor is amazing and the staff is extremely friendly. This is one of our favorite places in Vegas for dinner."}
{"text":"The service was ridiculous today. Called ahead, told it would be 15 minutes. Arrived 15 minutes later, paid, and was told it would be a couple of minutes. Eventually took a total of 45 minutes for our food to arrive!! That is ridiculous, you could have been that up front to begin with! The food is good, but it will be a while before we return with that kind of \"service\".   Oh, of course, no apology was given for the wait."}
{"text":"clean. both service and food were solid. nothing was exceptional, yet nothing was bad. we had pad thai, their equivalent of drunken noodle, duck basil, red curry, and tom ka kai. a solid neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years. I love their food, and the atmosphere (very clean). Try the Lemon Grass soup with chicken in a \"Hot Bowl\", its my favorite!  Also, their lunch specials are very inexpensive. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the questionable outside look of this restaurant fool you. The inside is very nice, and not what you would expect from how it looks on the outside. This is the best Thai restaurant I've ever eaten at. The food is top quality and sooo tasty. The shrimp Pad Thai is my favorite dish. The staff is always gracious, and it is pretty clean inside. Favorite Thai restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and craving thai food. We found pin kaow by chance and decided to try them out. We usually can't go wrong with thai food because most thai places are decent in general. However, there are some that stood out and others that missed the mark. Unfortunately, pin kaow didn't impress us with the food. Service was excellent! 2 stars for that...  When we walked in, we saw a lot of non asian diners, so we got a little weary because based on our experience with Thai places lacking asian diners means the food doesnt taste as authentic... But we were hungry and decided to chance it,,, well, besides the Thai ice tea, everything we ordered were pretty bland..  The curry was bland, tasted watery... Papaya salad tasted like they just shredded the papaya and tossed a few times around the sauce...pad Thai was bland as well.. We didn't finished eating because of the lack of flavor.. I guess you can say, being southeast asian, we're used to a more savory, rich in spices flavors and pretty particular. But we understand the lack of spices can be due to pin kaow catering to mostly non Asian diners, sorry to be so blunt.. However, adding more spices doesn't mean the food should be spicy, just more rich coconut milk in the curry, fish sauces, lime leaves and lemongrass, which are essential in southeast Asian cuisines,,   Service was great! But the food missed the mark for us..."}
{"text":"We read the reviews and decided to go. It was very good! We liked the outdoor seating and large indoor seating. We had 3 different plates and they were all Good. You can visit dressy or casual. Their interior very Thai, but not over the top. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food restaurant of all time! This place is fantastic. Get the drunken noodles!"}
{"text":"Pin Kaow turned out to be an awesome pick for my Saturday night dinner. I went with the crab fried rice. I was a skeptic, until I tried the rice and now I am a forever lover. Ning the bartender was super nice and helpful with answering my million questions. The ambience was dim and light music playing in the back ground. I will definitely come back and I would highly recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"OK, let's get this straight: In my 26 years in the Air Force, I spent almost half of my career overseas.  About half of that was spent in Okinawa, and we were TDY to Thailand almost half of that.  I could speak passable Thai at one time, and even though my accent now is terrible (Thai is a tonal language, so accent and inflection are essential) when I don't even look a the menu and order in Thai, I expect something authentic.  I ordered papaya salad with sticky rice and pahd see yew.  Both came out bland, and the Nam Phrik had jalapenos and not ki noo peppers.  Lotus of Siam made this same mistake.  I won't go back to either unless I'm desperate.  If you want real, authentic Thai street food, hit Thai-Style Noodle House on the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn or Pon Ocha Soup on Nellis and Stewart."}
{"text":"I've been here at least twice with the boyfriend, and I've been to another location up on the Northwest side of town. I like both, but this is my favorite of the two. The entire staff is always nice here, and their food isn't bad.  They have a 10-scale level of spice. LOL. I always get like a 5 or 6 'cause I can't handle more. My favorite has got to be their Pad Thai with chicken or beef. I liked their shrimp this past time, but they leave the tails on. It's no real gripe, just like the convenience of having chicken or beef. LOL. Had no choice last Friday 'cause I'm practicing Lent. Our favorite appetizer has got to be their Crab Rangoon. It can be more creamy than crabby, but it's still a good starter."}
{"text":"Food- good! Service- good! The busboys were very quick to pick up empty plates and dishes. My only complaint was that the portion of the Pad Thai could have been a little bigger, especially considering that rice noodles don't really cost that much. We got the Pad See Ew, Yellow curry, Thai BBQ chicken (that was my favorite dish that night) as well as the modest Pad Thai. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The other Thai Restaurant that I really like. Good proportion of food and the taste is really good."}
{"text":"Not my first time here but it had been awhile. Came on a Friday night and we're seated immediately even though it seemed pretty busy. The server was over within seconds to take our drink order. We got the spicy chicken salad, panang with chicken and pad see ew with beef. We got everything level 7. I would say it wasn't very spicy but thank god for the spice rack! We didn't leave an ounce of food left on our plates. Everything was great. Service was awesome. They give you orange slices with your check too!"}
{"text":"Ever since we went to Thailand in September, thai food in the states just doesn't seem to measure up. I just moved back to Vegas after being away for a few years. My hubby read the great reviews about this place so we decided to check it out. We got the Masaman and Pad thai, both with Tofu. The Masaman was okay, nice curry flavor, definitely could have gotten it more spicy (6 was too low) especially because it was a fairly sweet (as in taste) dish. The pad thai I thought was disappointing because it was VERY greasy/oily. There was a film all over the plate and you couldn't eat the noodles without getting the oil/grease everywhere. The serve was excellent though. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The thai iced coffee and tea were both good. I just think I'm still on the prowl for my favorite Vegas Thai place.....there was a place I liked when I lived here years ago...I'm going to try to hunt it down!!"}
{"text":"Ay yo for real doe this place dope af ya feel. I'm finna be coming back here heavy on folk nem. They vegetarian game be strong as a mf ya feel me lmaooooo 5/5"}
{"text":"There are many great Thai places in Vegas. Do not waste your time with this one. I didn't actually think Thai food could be inedible, it's my favorite cuisine. Pin Kaow proved me wrong. The server did not offer me another meal choice, simply brought me the bill when I told him I wasn't enjoying my lunch. I left with a literal and figurative bad taste in my mouth, feeling both sad and nauseous."}
{"text":"This is quite simply one of the best thai restaurants around. The flavors are fresh, the selections are vast, the service is charming and pleasant. We have been going here for years. It is tremendously well run. The papaya salad and tom kha soups are great starters bursting with flavors. The spice level tends to be on the higher side so be safe with your numbering. Every time we go we get our staples and try something new and our favorites keep changing. They have a happy hour now which is nice too."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a long time. Around 4 or 5 months ago I had an issue with the service and I stop going for a little bit I decided to go back again. After waiting for an 1h and 40 min our food was served cold and in pretty bad condition. They don't even offer to replace it. The service is horrible and the staff is rude. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Always so good to come and eat here. The wait staff is always pleasant and the food is always good! I don't like spicy food and they tone the spiciness down just to how I want it. I also like the ambience - the orchids inside and the garden outside.Favorite is the Duck Basil with that tasty boneless duck, the Pad See Ew, and the sweet rice mango dessert."}
{"text":"Food poisoning alert       I used to love coming here. It was one of my absolute favorite Thai restaurants in town. After yesterday's event, I will never be back. My girlfriend and I stopped by Pin Kaow for lunch where we both had the pumpkin Thai curry (my absolute all time favorite dish from here). I got my usual shrimp curry and my friend got chicken curry. We noticed as we were eating the squash was undercooked and there were hardened pieces we had to pick out. The dish was also served warm and not hot. We ate around 1230 and left around 1pm. I live about 6 minutes from the restaurant and my stomach was intensely cramping the whole way home. I literally had to run to the bathroom when I got in. Then the nausea started and the vomiting and you can guess how horribly the rest of my night went. My friend was fine, so I think I had bad shrimp since that's the only difference between our two dishes. I will NEVER be back. Gross. Just gross."}
{"text":"I had padthai for lunch.  It was great, nicely cooked.  Service was also great and prompt.  Only thing is if you are vegetarian then they will not change their chicken soup or the eggroll to a vegi substitute.  So you are paying $10 just for the noodles with no sides."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow has great Thai cuisine! I come to visit the in laws twice a year and we make sure we stop in here every time we are in town! The green curry is delicious but I found a new favorite tonight, the pumpkin curry! Order at least a 7 for spiciness! The mint chicken is also tasty!"}
{"text":"If you are always looking for the BEST thai out there, then search no more! The food here is the consistently delicious, and the service is TOP NOTCH. I eat here probably about 2-3 times a month, maybe about 30 visits total since it has opened in my area. The new potstickers they offer as an appetizer are sublime, as well as the beef satay. Some of my favorite dishes are the Spicy Chili Mint noodles, Spicy Eggplant with Chicken, and the Panang Curry is the best curry I have had to date. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pin Kaow is in my area so this is our main Thai spot. It is pretty good but it is a little pricy for food that consists mostly of rice and noodles. The decor in here is very pretty and it is just an overall pleasant place to sit and have dinner. There are some very good dishes here. I love the Pad Thai and a lot of the appetizers are really good. I was disappointed with my sticky rice because it was harder than usual. I think it might have been reheated in the microwave. The service was okay. Our server wasn't particularly attentive or pleasant but he wasn't bad. The main reason I gave them 3 stars was because you can get Thai food that is just as good for less and with just as good service at other places. But if you are looking for a nice pretty place to have decent Thai food, Pin Kaow is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow is that old standby, the one that you know is always good, always has great service.  You can relax when you come to Pin Kaow.  Your Thai food is going to taste just like you remember it did the last time you were here.  Chicken Satay, Pad Thai, and the best Tom Yum Kai in town are our 3 go-to dishes, no matter what.  The atmosphere is soothing."}
{"text":"BF went here years ago, and ever since we moved back, he's mentioned it every time we go out for Thai. We finally made it in this evening for dinner.  Though it's located in a strip mall, the interior d√©cor is quite nice, and the service was on point throughout our visit: attentive, polite, and professional. I was impressed before we even got to the food.  Started with the Fishcakes app- $8. Good portion for the price, cakes weren't too greasy and seemed meatier than others we've had. Herbs and seasonings were mixed into the patties, making them quite flavorful. The cucumber salad was also fresh and flavorful, perfectly complement to the cakes. Shared the hotpot of tom kha kai soup- $12. Large hot pot serving is good for us, since we love this soup. First impression of the dish was that it was incredibly well balanced. The broth was super flavorful, and there was a good amount of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and cilantro in the soup itself. Lastly, we split the duck curry entr√©e- $14. As my BF put it, \"This is possibly the best curry I've ever had.\" The duck was perfectly cooked, the curry sauce was amazing, and the pineapple and peppers worked well to bring the dish together. Portion was a good size, and came with a small side of white rice. The only change I might make to this dish would possibly be to add more veggies to it.  All in all, dinner with tip was just over $40 for two on a Friday night. Service was impeccable, food was flavorful and well balanced, and this is definitely a place I'd go back to- Vegas has a lot of good Thai restaurants, but this one has all of the elements to make it stand out as great."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Ordered a glass of wine and received it in a giant glass with barely any liquid. While we were eating, the waiter asked if we needed boxes to put the food in! We were far from being finished. The Pad Thai  was mediocre. Will not go back for dinner again or for any meal."}
{"text":"The setting in the restaurant was really nice and felt home-y? However the food was definitely not what I would have expected from a Thai restaurant this big. I ordered shrimp pad Thai, the shrimp had a very old fishy smell and taste to it. Which I didn't say anything bc maybe it was a bad day and I'm not really that customer. So we're eating, was there for about 45 mins? About 3-4 different people checked on us about 20 times!! It was starting to get annoying so I wanted to leave and the last 5 minutes we were there about 3 people left us the same check. Anyways this place is nice on the outside and in but the staff is annoying and the food isn't good."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place!! Service is always good, prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious!! We always order the shrimp pad thai, spicy chicken mint, and the one sun beef. Perfect meal every time and there are always leftovers for the next day!"}
{"text":"The ambience on the patio is wonderful and the music that was playing was great too! Perfect little escape in Vegas  order the pineapple fried rice- you won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"I went in to get take out just for sticky rice and the entire made fun of me in Thai assuming that I wouldn't hear them while waiting for my order. I felt so disrespected as I'm still fairly new to the Thai/Laotion community out here in the state of Nevada and they solidified the fact that the Thai/Lation community isn't worth getting to know. Depressing when they have a hiring sign in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this is my go-to place.  The restaurant is small but beautiful.  I love the wood wall and all the orchids.  They occasionally have a Green Mango Salad on their specials board, which is amazing.  It's not my favorite for Thai Beef Salad (the beef is overcooked and dry) and their Thai tea is really, really sweet.  I have tried almost the entire menu and it is all outstanding. The staff is attentive."}
{"text":"Service was great, waitress was very tentative. The price of the food was a bit much for the portion size. Meals were served on really big plates to make it look like more.  I'm a little biased when it comes to Thai food so, the taste on the Lard na, pad kra pow, and calamari I ordered, was okay.   Still on the hunt for an awesome Thai joint."}
{"text":"My best friend has been here several times and said it was great.  The food was just ok.  Any time I asked a question the server looked at me like I was insane and repeated my question like it was crazy I was asking. I love spicy!!! So I get an 8 on the scale and add extra chili if need be.. but an 8 here was sooooo hot! Literally had tears streaming from my eyes!  Also don't give 1 free refill on thai tea like other places I've been to."}
{"text":"Great food. But had no love for those who served in the armed services No Veterans Day recognition.  Wow. Wish we knew before we sat down to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I order carry-out it's great, which is DEFINITELY saying something. My special order is never messed up. The customer service is amazing. I'm always greeted with kind smiles at the door."}
{"text":"LOVED IT! I love Le Thai, but seen the reviews and decided to give it a try! We got the Panang curry and combination fried rice. I'm pretty picky with Thai food because not every Thai restaurant is good. I've actually went to one that was down right gross and literally made me sick. I was off Thai food for a while until my friend had me go to Le Thai and reminded me as why I loved it. this place is pretty much as good as Le Thai but I do feel like I get more food at Le Thai. Next time I go I'm going to have to see but I'm pretty sure I do. None the less this place was good. I just wish it was a little bigger servings. (Maybe I just eat too much lol)"}
{"text":"I love everything I've eaten here but the pad thai and beef curry are SOOOOO good."}
{"text":"Excellent Red chicken curry, pad Thai, Tom young goon soup. Papaya salad with dried shrimp is excellent.  Excellent customer service"}
{"text":"The service and food at this Pin-Kaow location is outstanding.  Everyone who works there is so friendly, I usually meet friends there for lunch.  Everyone I take there enjoys the food and the lunch specials are so fantastic.  Penny O'Brien"}
{"text":"This place is good as long as you haven't been to the location on Rainbow. I have been to the location on the N.Rainbow many times, and the service is always fast and every bite is full of flavor. The location in Eastern has had average service, and decent food. The food has not been as good at this location as the others. Thai food is known for the spices, and the food at this location is just not as full of flavor. However, if you love in Henderson it is still pretty tasty. ..if the other locations are too far for you."}
{"text":"i have been to this place several time,  was there this past satuday for a dinner,  and it was empty!!!!  so i would expect great service.....uhhh not thtis time.  they must hae sent most of the staff home,  so it took a while to get something to drink.  food is good,  but it seems over time the portion sizes have shrunk, and of course the prices have not shrunk to match!!  overall its a good place, especially in henderson, when you dont want to drive over to the other side of town for your asian fix!"}
{"text":"Nice Thai restaurant with a beautiful outdoor patio dining area.  Had the Hell Curry with shrimp which was pretty good.  The menu is pretty extensive and most if not all items are reasonably priced.   The service was pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"This restaurant had good, delicious Thai food. I got the chicken pad Thai, while my husband had the chicken pad see ew. The only thing I found odd was that I had almost no chicken in my meal while my husband had more than he could eat. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Travelled all over sampling a variety of Thai cuisine and Pin Kaow is the only one that comes close to the fare you would find in Thailand. Service is phenomenal and they genuinely care about the customer."}
{"text":"Customer service was ok, but the food wasnt.  I asked for level 9 for red curry and they simply added three slices of jalape√±o. The taste was BLAND, very flavorless. I wouldn't recommend it. My friend got the brocolli beef and sames story. I'm dissapointed."}
{"text":"First time visit today...the service was seriously the best I've ever had in an Asian restaurant.  Just the right amount of genuine attentiveness and friendly.  They were exceptionally kind to my toddler daughter who got her own little plate, utensils and kid cup without me asking.   The food was good.  My pad Thai was a bit sweet for my taste but still very high quality and enjoyable.  We went on a Saturday and there was no lunch special.  It was kind of expensive for the portions and lunch in general.  The only real complaint I had was the seriously horrible loud music they had playing.  It was so strange!  A combination of bad jazz and elevator music.  The other patrons were laughing at it as well.  It didn't fit the restaurant mood at all.   Stars for fast attentive service but lose a star for being overpriced.  We may be back, if it were less expensive, definitely."}
{"text":"There aren't very many good places to dine in vegas outside the strip, so at first I was hesitant to try this place out, but I'm glad I did.  It's in a little plaza that usually looks empty, but my favorite pho place was closed, so I tried it out.    First off, I LOVE the decor inside! They put a lot of effort into their ambiance and it shows!  You wouldn't guess it looked this way from the outside and the neighboring buildings.  I haven't explored the menu too thoroughly because I'm just hooked to their green chicken curry! So good I have to it every time I go.  My fiance usually gets the Pad Thai,  which is also very good.  I believe they offer shrimp or chicken as their meat choices  He also really enjoys their green curry with catfish.  Service is always good.  Staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Great food clean interior great service. Only complaint is my \"3\" spicy level felt more like a 33."}
{"text":"I love that this place is in my neighborhood.  It is rare to find a Thai restaurant that serves masaman curry, much less good-tasting masaman curry!  This place is easily the best Thai place I've eaten at.  In my opinion, Lotus of Siam does not compare.  Also, the combination fried rice is delicious and extremely flavorful.  I usually order takeout; they are very prompt and accurate when quoting a pick-up time.  The few times I have dined at the restaurant, service was probably as good as it gets for being an Asian restaurant.  The servers and bussers were attentive and did not let your drink sit empty for long.   One negative thing about this place is that they only serve one small bowl of rice for two people.  Extra rice is like $2.50 per bowl, which I find ridiculous, especially when both guests order curry and a small bowl is obviously not enough for two people.  I love trying out new Thai restaurants, but when I'm in the mood to eat Thai food and I don't want to be disappointed, I choose Pin Kaow."}
{"text":"SERVICE:  Every time I've come here I've ordered take out so I'm not familiar with the waitress' service but they always greet me when I walk in and out.   FOOD:  Curry here tastes very authentic and perfect. I like how they give you a scale of 1-10 for spiciness instead of just mild/medium/hot. The mango tasted fresh and sweet. Mm mmm mmmm. Next time I'll have to order other items."}
{"text":"Friendly service, solid food, great cocktails"}
{"text":"I have visited Pin Kaow twice now. Once when I was SUPER exhausted after a flight (and anything would taste good at that time) and once for a night out with a friend.   The restaurant has a nice, dimly lit atmosphere and you're greeted as soon as you walk in. Bathrooms are kind of awkwardly placed right as you enter...but I mean...who cares I guess. So far, I have tried the chicken pad thai, pad see ew, green curry, and crab rangoon.   The food is good. I've had a hard time finding Thai food in Vegas that isn't overly salted, and overly saucy. The only issue I had was they really seemed to struggle with the spice level. I asked for a high level of spice, but really it barely had any spice. This is a big no no for me because I like my thai food SPICY. Either way, I would likely return, because it's a nice atmosphere and the food was good overall."}
{"text":"I get delivery from them twice a month it's fast & i like their chili mint noodle, the chicken satay, duck fried rice.  Inexpensive & tasty"}
{"text":"Place is always crowded.  Good sign.  Many vegetarian options and the food is very fresh.  I've eaten here many times and I'm a bit surprised by some of the poor ratings they've received."}
{"text":"I have frequented this location numerous times but every visit seems to be getting least favorable as the visit before. I've been visiting this establishment for the past five years. Their food has always tasted great and the wait staff was always attentive. However as years go by the portion sizes became smaller and the prices increase. I've visited this location twice this month. One early afternoon for happy hour and was seated immediately however the food arrived 45 mins after it was placed. On tonight's visit our table ordered four entrees and only two showed up. We thought it would arrive immediately after however twenty minutes passed and it took waving down two servers in order for us to get the rest of our meal. The manager took our order and never checked on us to see if we received our entire meal, it was later another wait staff would check on us after receiving the missing entrees. Sad to say a favored spot will no longer be my go to Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a working lunch here.  I love the decor and it was very quiet and after the usual lunch crowd.  It was a nice place to go over my contracts.  I had Chicken Broccoli and a side salad as a Lunch Special. First they brought me out a really nice soup.  I was surprised the sauce on the Chicken Broccoli was not very thick.  I am not sure if that  is how it is supposed to be or not. The dish was very fresh and healthy.  I love the aroma of the tea, I should have asked what it was.  The tea tab was not in English.    I visited the restroom before I left and I love the fact it was so clean and finished with high quality tiles and counters.  There was even a free salt scrub for your hands and I love the smell of that.  It is the little things that mean so much.  This restaurant rocks it for me in terms of the food, the service, the decor, the cleanliness and friendliness of the servers.  I have been here a few times before before I became a YELPER and those experiences were also just as wonderful.  I like the Pineapple Fried Rice, the War Wonton Soup and you must try the Asian Pear Martini with an orchid in it.  What could be more decadent?"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, and nothing compares to the quality of food found in Pin Kaow.  The customer service is also top notch."}
{"text":"I have to say as far as Thai food goes here, this is the best ive had so far. Have to take off a star for flavor though because when i ordered my papaya salad, i asked for level 5 thinking like 5 peppers, medium spicy. It had NO SPICE at all. Was disapointed. Other than that, the foods great!"}
{"text":"Seafood dishes are good. Beef jerky is yummy. Yellow curry seafood is my favorite. Always make room for sticky rice with mangoes or get it to go. Definitely one of my comfort food."}
{"text":"I usually dont eat Thai food. but when I do, this is the place. For you Latino and non Latino spicy lovers 1-10 heat level is available. Easy access and parking. Staff friendley, quiet, didn't even hear clacking of silver ware. Awesome woodwork decor. Authentic, along with the staff's authentic Thailand dress wear. The food, \"Caliente Bueno\"."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for the last 9 years! Whether it's for wonton soup or panang curry, you won't be disappointed! Amazing coconut shrimp, edemame, chicken chow mein and now matter what time of year, they always have the BEST oranges for an after-dinner delight. Their coconut ice cream is to die for!"}
{"text":"Wifey and I met our friend gary there for dinner last night.  Once again to preface, we would fly to bangkok for food weekends.  Our friend Gary has been to thailand a load of times so we have high expectations.  Ambience : Very thai very nice interior, they have a patio area as well.  Didnt see people out there yet so I dont know if they have miss-ters or what the deal is with that.   Service: very attentive, quick to answer questions and check on us.  most staff are thai (a good sign).  Also asked for something \"off menu\" and were supplied with what we wanted.  Spice Level 1-10: however our thai server let us know she orders stuff into the 15 level.  Found a 5 was enough to make me sweat probably could've gone to an 8 for my wife and gary (yes I am a bit weak when it comes to chilis) however, they supply the tray of condiments of chili flakes fish sauce etc if you want to push it up a notch personally.  THE FOOD  Penang curry (gai-chicken): very creamy and tasty rich yellow curry and the chicken was done perfectly.  Morning glory/water spinach: this wasnt on the menu, however it is the go to vegetable dish anytime we are in thailand, we were very happy they could make it for us was very very tasty, spicy and fresh  Mongolian beef: not quite thai but tasty a little on the sweet side  Tom yum goong soup: quite nice and tasty not too sour, very nice in a hot pot to keep it nice and hot.  Fish cakes: very good taste, texture we would like for it to be a bit more crispy on the outside, but the taste was definitely like back in thailand and we were happy and they disappeared quickly (think i sucked mine down too fast)  Green tea ice cream: not overpowering green tea tasted fresh and well done and home made  Coconut ice cream : very cream and coconutty.  We will go again and i was a bit of a gawker at other people's food.  Want to try the mint chili noodles and fish fishes as well as the mango sticky rice dessert.  We will be going back and soon.  I think Gary is already going back the next day.  Great find and we were very happy with everything.  I rarely do a 5 star as something for 5 stars has to be the best of the best of something, and for thai food, my 5 star ratings are for food carts on the side of the road in bangkok while choking on exhaust fumes so go figure."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place in Henderson!! I love getting the lunch special during the week. Food is always really good and everyone is super nice. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, during a quick trip to Vegas, I was determined to find great Thai food outside of California (specifically Hollywood/No Ho).  After much research, I was set on treating a very special man in my life (and extremely picky Thai food eater) to the much lauded Lotus of Siam.  However, being in the neighborhood, we decided to grab a bite at Pin-Kaow, and we were not disappointed.  Located in an unassuming strip mall off Rainbow & Lake Mead, the sign for Pin-Kaow, in big bold caps, is definitely not hard to miss.  However, for those unfamiliar with great Thai food, it may be easy to overlook.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were impressed with the elaborate traditional design.  Think intricately carved, polished wood, and slightly dim lighting.  Classy enough for a lovely dinner date, yet casual enough for quick daytime lunch.  This was exactly the kind of place  we had opted for.  We were seated promptly and given several different menus, one of which was for their lunch specials.  We both went with entrees and ended up ordering a bowl of boat noodles, red curry with chicken, nam kao tod  and spicy chili mint noodles.  Everything was ordered at a level of 7 or 8 spiciness, but be cautious with this spice level, as some dishes were spicier than others.  The boat noodles and curry were good and satisfied a craving, as did the spicy chili mint noodles.  The portions were big enough for two people with big appetites (or as my boyfriend would say, \"big enough to feed a small family.\")  However, what really made a big impression on us was the nam kao tod!  If you've never ordered this, you're missing out.  It's basically a crispy rice salad with sour sausage, cashews, lime juice, chili flakes, and other elements of deliciousness.  The texture, and bold flavor were a perfect complement to a sunny vegas afternoon in Spring.  Neither of us ordered from the drink menu, but they seem to have a nice beer selection for a reasonable price.  All in all, although I have yet to try the critically acclaimed \"Lotus\" in Vegas, Pin-Kaow is a nice (and more cost effective!) alternative."}
{"text":"I was really unimpressed. My boyfriend and I went in wanting pad thai like we are used to finding at other restaurants. What we got was expensive, not anything special, and a small portion size."}
{"text":"Visited Pin Kaow this evening after vowing not to return for at least a year - that was 14 to 15 months ago. So, this evening I walked in, sat down and my server took my order. I ordered a bee, an iced tea and some soup. My waiter never brought the beer. To add, my soup was watery and tasteless. I then asked, \"Where is my beer that I ordered?'. His response: \"I forgot....\". Management was unfriendly and unresponsive. Will never return.   1-star seems generous....."}
{"text":"Awesome curry and chili mint noodles. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat around town."}
{"text":"How can one of the best go so mediocre???! I've dined with Pin Kaow for over 15 years now, mostly at the N Rainbow location. I recently ordered to-go for my colleagues at work, chicken pad Thai, Thai beef and brocolli, Panang tofu curry and papaya salf... completely disappointed. Poor food quality and little to no Thai flavors!!.. see all my other reviews, I'm VERY easy to please!! Granted, I've eaten Thai food my entire life, yet this had little ethnic adherence to style and flavor!! I must say however service was excellent,....I WILL be on the search for others worthy of Thai definition!. All helpers, please give me a good recommend in henderson/GVR area!!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall with plentiful parking. Lovely mango bellini. The fried tofu left much to be desired but my entree (panang curry) was quite good and was substantial enough for me to have leftovers too. Wait staff was a little pushy at the end; it was only 10 pm and they basically booted us out the door. It gets really busy during regular dinner times but they will seat you even if your entire party is not yet present."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but I agree with some of the other opinions - it is inconsistent and I feel like quality is going down. However, i still think this location is the best Thai food in town. Much better than famous Archie's ( horrible, greasy, greasy, greasy, food drowning in old, low quality oil). We love vegetarian pad soon sen and vegetarian panang. 4 stars for the inconsistency."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant so we gave it a try. So glad that we did! The food is so good and the service is even better. Best Thai food we have had in Las Vegas so far. I'm mad that we live so far from it! Ordered the calamari, cashew chicken, pad woon sen, crab fried rice, raspberry margarita and the dragon berry mojito. We loved everything! Our waiter was amazing and made sure we had everything needed, but didn't check on us too often to be annoying! Lol. The prices are a little higher than were used to, but I'm willing to pay more for the quality we got! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I am in Love with their tom yum hot pot!! So delicious! Every time I am in that area, I have to stop there to eat! Another favorite dish is the spicy eggplant with beef! I love eggplant so I usually get additional eggplant added too. One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I got takeout from here today. I hadn't been there before but I decided to try it out. I'm not adventurous with Thai food, so I typically default to pad se ew. I ordered this, spice level 3, with chicken. Wow! Best pad se ew I've even eaten! It was incredibly flavorful. It was $10, but it was a good portion size, and it tasted amazing! I will definitely be back to get this again and likely check out other parts of the menu."}
{"text":"I had a craving of bbq ribs. So my husband brought me here. The ribs were a little not too much tender. The chowmein was good. I liked the steamed veggies.  The service is good but waitresses dont smile. I like to smile to my customers. Thats why I notice that a lot in a person when Im the customer."}
{"text":"In a rush, they put meat in my vegetarian dish. I understand they make mistakes, but the server was adamant that it was vegetarian. I was just about to take a bite, and she comes rushing over once she realized it was the wrong dish she brought. I told my server about this issue, and she just shrugged her shoulders as if no big deal. It used to be a lot better, but won't come here again in the future."}
{"text":"Food is good, but horrible customer service. We ordered from them every week about once a week since my job is down the street them there. Ordered online on MLK day and paid then received a phone call saying they do not have the lunch specials on holidays because they need to pay their staff overtime because it is a holiday. I was working when I placed the order and was not being paid overtime because of it being a holiday, but that is not the point. Unfortunately they have lost all of my business. I will not be returning to their location because they wanted to charge the dinner portions during lunch hours on a Monday(holiday). Being selfish for 10 more dollars that have lost a regular customer who spends 30+ dollars a week at the restaurant.  Also, since they have new management they have reduced their portions."}
{"text":"This place is solid!! It's always busy and bear my house. I tried the Thai beef salad - easy on the spice !!! Good place for Thai!"}
{"text":"First time here. It was ok. The lunch specials are great with the soup egg roll and entree. I got the chicken pad Thai. The pad Thai was great although the chicken was really rubbery. It almost tasted like 2 or 3 day old chicken. Definitely not freshly cooked. That was pretty disappointing. The service was great, everyone was on top of everything. Very efficient. Atmosphere was great. If the chicken was better it would have been a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lunch specials are amazing. My wife and I eat here every week. The crab Rangoon are a must. Chicken satay are an other fav of mine. Pumpkin curry is delicious. My wife is not into Asian or Thai but she loves this place. She loves the dumpling soups. You cannot not go wrong with all of the dishes at this restaurant. Staff are always friendly and service is fast."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently came here for dinner. I ordered the chicken chow mein and he ordered the Thai BBQ chicken. It took a while for the food to be delivered to our table, and once it came I wasn't very impressed. The food was just ok tasting and the portion size was pretty small. As we started to reach the end of the meal, my boyfriend noticed a piece of chicken on his plate that looked completely raw. As we were driving back to his apartment, he started feeling extremely sick. He ended up loosing all the food he had just eaten. Needless to say, we will never be returning back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"As a guy who loves chicken curry I was excited when I saw pumpkin curry, I gotta try this. I of course had it with chicken and it was a knockout. The aroma of pumpkin is more than obvious when it hit the table but upon the first forkful it enlivens the senses. It was all over the palate but not overwhelming, taunting the nose and blending well with the texture of rice and vegetables. I almost used a straw to get it all from the dish but restrained. A seasonal item so get it while you can"}
{"text":"Great Thai food, the original location is probably my favorite, but this location is in Henderson and has a cool patio.  They have all the standard Thai staples and done well. No complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"Service was rushed , the manager and waiter were very argumentative and made me uncomfortable , the food was not made in a vegetarian way , will not be coming back again ."}
{"text":"Come and visit the food is great . Its my favorite thai place . I always get the sweet and sour beef .. and the staff is really nice and attentive"}
{"text":"My favorite thai place.... come in and visit they have reall great food and customer service"}
{"text":"My go-to Thai food utopia. Lake mead and rainbow is the best location and that only  one I will go to. I love the shrimp pad-thai and these people have anything tofu, mastered. Everyone should go here, and if u happen to try their other locations first, you will be even happier with the original."}
{"text":"Always a quick, well made delicious meal. Great for business meetings when time is limited. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"My family has an overall good lunch last weekend here.  The Thai basil chicken dish and pad see-ew were good and the service was great.   We'll be back next time we're back."}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place is right around the corner!  Awesome Thai food, and their Thai Tea is excellent!  My favorite dish is the seafood soup (can't remember the thai name at the moment) and their catfish delight.    Great to go to during non-peak hours for good service; you can also order to go -- the restaurant isn't that big so you'd probably be better off that way."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and usually the food is pretty good although it is never hot enough for us.  Went yesterday and had the seafood curry in young coconut off the specials menu YUM!!! It was really really good although a little pricey.  Also tried the Mint Duck which was OK.  The fish cakes are always good."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and great service. Their Tom Yum soup is probably the best I've had. Place is very pretty and always clean, food comes fast and they are very accommodating."}
{"text":"I always go to Archi's when I want Thai food (Yes, yes, I know Archi's is not authentic, but it taste really good xD). When I found out there is a thai restaurant 5 mins from my house, I know I have to try it out. The first experience was a take out order, I ordered the pad thai, and I thought it was pretty good. Then, I took my friend here to try it together.  The atmosphere here is great, it's a little dark, but the decorations and everything add the 'thai' feeling to the restaurant. The seats are pretty comfortable.  We ordered the Tom Yum Kung Soup, Panang Curry(Waitress suggested this one), and Pad Thai. The soup and pad thai was good, but nothing special. The most important thing is that the panang curry was awesome! It's better than red, yellow, or green curry that I have tried :)  Although the food was good, the portion was quite small for the price..."}
{"text":"this place is beautiful, and magically delicious..  I'm a huge fan of pin kaow  and am happy to say that it's just as great..  the decor is beautiful!!   the wait staff is friendly and are on point about refills and making sure everything's ok.    I always have the same thing:  an appetizer platter that offers crab cakes, shrimp and veggie eggrolls, and crab wontons. yellow chicken curry..  and the seafood delight. mm.   pad Thai is excellent here as well!  when it's nice out in vegas.. definitely eat outside.  it's way beautiful and super serene."}
{"text":"If you come to eat at a Thai restaurant for pad Thai, fried rice etc. this will be fine (favored by locals). If you're looking for a more interesting dining experience than that keep looking. The sea bass was tough and they kept asking me if \"everything is okay\" and when I told them why I wasn't eating it they did nothing to address the issue. Nice waitress but it didn't make up for the subpar food. There is a good Thai restaurant in a strip mall but I can't remember the name...."}
{"text":"Worst place first time and last time i order tum yum soups from here better at kung fu plaza... here is more expensive and dont give rice with the order"}
{"text":"I use to live on the SW side of town, so I would go to the one on Rainbow all the time. No matter where I'm at, I will find my way to Pin Kaow at least once a week! No other Thai restaurant compares. I eat Thai religiously! Seriously, everything on their menu is great!"}
{"text":"Vegas is home to a ton of amazing Thai restaurants, and Pin Kaow is not an exception. Their food is delicious (my table got a selection of curries, noodles, and vegetable dishes, and everyone was happy with their meals), the ambiance is unbeatable, and in a convenient location, it really has so much to offer. Our food was out really quickly, and the service was top-notch. I definitely recommend Pin Kaow if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Went here on the advice of a friend.  the staff were helpful and prompt.  We have standard dishes we order when eating tai.  Chicken pad Tai was a bit sweeter than we like and the spicy chicken eggplant had flattened pieces of chicken that were under seasoned.  The eggplant and the sauce were good.  Pricing was similar to other Thai Restaurants we have tried locally.  They did have extensive seafood options. We did not try any of the seafood.  They were helpful talking to the kitchen regarding ingredients."}
{"text":"I loved, loved, loved this place and I am so upset to give it only 1 star. Unfortunately after my fianc√©e and I went there last night, he woke up around 6am and started throwing up pad woon sen everywhere. Food poisoning is a big no-no in my book! Although I didn't get sick from my Chicken pad Thai, I don't recommend taking a gamble on getting sick over the food here and I will not be returning back."}
{"text":"Simply awesome Thai food. Another example of how this town has many diamonds in the rough. Had the Bell Curry on a level 7.5 (yes they humored me) and I can't wait to try a 9. A lot of heat with a ton of flavor. If you've never tried Thai, go there now!"}
{"text":"Expensive, not good food (meat had gristle like they handpicked the crappiest piece available), charges you for refills (who does that?). Please stay away from this place. Go anywhere else but here. It's a rip off. Small portions with super expensive prices. Won't ever eat here again. Like I said, any other place is better than here. Absolutely do not recommend it."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to live near Pin-Kaow on Rainbow...food is great there...I always order the lunch special...Beef Thai Salad...is so good...the first time I order...they ask me how spicy I want it....from 1-10....so I thought just to be safe...pick 5...thinking is not going to be too spicy or too mild...I was wrong....I didn't know it will be that spicy.....my lips were burning hot...so from now on...I only pick 1 or 2...so just be careful about how spicy you want your food to be...other than that...Staffs are very friendly ...Prices are great...if you like Thai food...this is a great place to eat..=)"}
{"text":"I like to order takeout here on my way home from work, and I wanted to be daring and try a spice level 7 out of 10 in my panang veggie curry with tofu, instead of my usual safe level 5.  OWWWWW!!!!!  I bit straight into what looked like a sliced green bell pepper and definitely WAS not!! Ouch ouch ouch! No milk in my house!! WHAT?!!! Only Greek yogurt! I slathered my tongue in the Greek yogurt to try and knock out the spice. I felt like my eyes were gonna explode out of my head!!  After about half an hour of sweating I was still hungry and strangly still wanted curry. So I meticulously picked out every suspicious looking green item and then enjoyed the rest of my dish. I tried to trick my boyfriend into eating the \"green veggies\" but he caught on to my gimmicks. I'm not good at keeping a straight face.  Next time, \"panang curry, but hold the peppers please!\""}
{"text":"Delicious!  Got delivery, no charge! Arrived promptly, within probably 20mins.  Got the yellow curry... Amazing!!! Big chunks of chicken in the most delicious yellow curry sauce. Got medium spice and it was quite spicy! Boyfriend got chicken pad thai, also delicious.  Price is very reasonable. About 9 for each entree, enough for two to share but since it was soooo good, we didnt!"}
{"text":"Consistency is key. I'm not sure what blow your mind Thai food would be like, but this place is good enough where my family and I come back all the time. We get the usual noob stuff, pad thai, chicken pinang curry, pad see ew beef. My in laws come so often the waitresses usually know their order. Spring rolls- get them because they come out piping hot. Crab ragoons are pretty good. If you are spice sensitive I would ask if the cook is heavy handed or not, sometimes the 4 is too spicy. Service is usually always really good, fast and attentive, some staff do have thick accents (I'm Asian and not hating). And if you wanted to do an add on while eating, they are usually quick to get the dish out. We've ordered take out and that service has been good too."}
{"text":"Visiting family from out of town. And stumbled upon this place. I read the reviews, and i decided to give it a try. We ordered pad Thai shrimp, pad see ew pork. I feel like you can never go wrong with these two dishes as a Thai restaurant and as a Thai person eating said Thai food. Anyway. Overall, it was pretty good. Enough with the food.    The ambiance was super nice, it felt authentic. I felt that the staff were pretty attentive as well. Judging from the moment anyone would walk through the door, and they would all greet a guest promptly.   I loved that they all had uniforms and name tags. It feels very \"fine dining\". I mean, just judging from what I see here.   Overall I'd eat there again. It seems like a nice place, intimate spot to take your date or family dining."}
{"text":"Yes!  My husband and I are huge Thai food fans, and have a plethora of awesome choices in San Diego, and were very happy to eat here while in Vegas visiting a Vegas local.  All the dishes were made well and to order, and the atmosphere was nice and cozy.  I really enjoyed their stipulation on page 1 of the menu that \"parents are fully responsible for their children's activities in the restaurant.\"  This coming ironically after a trip to another Thai restuarant in Vegas and 2 very specific and obnoxious children were running wild through the restaurant.  Uck.  The very pretty \"silver\" container that the side of rice comes in is a nice presentation, but the plastic (?) doesn't keep the rice warm at all :-(  Mint chili noodles had a great flavour, but no mint?  Spice eggplant was great as always.  Service is quick, efficient and helpful.  And they stay open between lunch and dinner hours!!!  (Charge dinner prices)."}
{"text":"Decent thai food. We ordered takeout and chose a wide variety of dishes. pad thai, sweet and sour dishes and multiple appetizers. Nothing stood out as amazing however the crunchy fried chix left me perplexed: it is a piece of fried chix which has been strategicaly dissected... the chix meat has been removed, and replaced with a pork stuffing..and then it is sewn back up in the deep fried chix skin...interesting.  They do not deliver until 4 pm-fyi"}
{"text":"I literally have no idea why this restaurant post pics on Yelp looks so fancy, but the fact is, their portion size is really small and overprice! Even the taste is not that good, they should charge each portion like around $7. Overall the environment looks good. If you want a nice view, go here. If you want enjoy your food. I highly not recommend to go this one. Servers are all Thai ppl, but the cuisine is not that 'local'."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in this Pin Kaow location, as for years I visited the S. Rainbow location with no problems.  I met a friend for lunch today, and although the Chicken Curry was delicious and I considered returning just to have it again, I will not return to a restaurant location when I end up with a throbbing headache afterwards.  No bueno.    By the way, no photos - I thought about taking pics when my bowl was just about empty."}
{"text":"I'm not a native Las Vegan, but I hit this place each and every time I'm  visiting relatives, or even when I'm in town for business. Yep, I'll drive on over from a conference hotel on the Strip to get my food fix here! Great Thai food and generous portions! I usually order the Cashew Nut Chicken - YUMMY - and my wife typically feasts on a chicken-egg plant dish. I couple my meal with a huge glass of Thai Iced Tea - I wish other Thai restaurants would follow suit and not skimp on the beverages. Absolutely every time I've dined here, the place was crowded, so come by a little before lunch time or dinner time to try to avoid standing in line. What a hidden gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I dined in restaurant for the first time yesterday. The food took a little long to come out but granted, it was super busy. I ordered the soft shell crab and it was to die for. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! The food is so delicious . We didn't eat there but we ordered a large order for our medical faculty to have for lunch everyone loved it ! I felt bad I kept calling to add more to our order but they were super friendly and nice . Our order was ready quickly . The shrimp tempura, beef jerky and pad see ew are a must have ! Definitely will be ordering from them more often ."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome and authentic in everyway!  The hospitality starts at the door and continues throughout your meal.  Definitely try the Crying Tiger, the special Thai sauce, served on the side and the tenderness and juiciness of the beef is out of this world! The tofu Pad Thai is excellent too!  So far pretty much everything I have tried here is better than most!"}
{"text":"I ordered Pad Thai and it was the worst! I don't know why you would keep something like that even on menu. I used to like this place but over the past year or so it's become the worst Thai place in town. The food is greasy, flavorless and sometimes not enough ingredients are there. Like today there were literally only four small tofu pieces in the whole meal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant rocks! From clean decor, friendly service and a solid menu, the place is a hit. Went today for a work lunch with a client- we had the duck breast pad Thai and the crab - both really tasty! Liked it so I brought my wife back for dinner. The calamari is amazing- lite but crispy. And for $50 how can you not make this a go to place?"}
{"text":"I frequent this place when I'm in the mood for thai. It's on my way home from work so I call it in as im leaving and it's always ready for pickup when I get there. The last visit I ordered the panang curry level 5, chicken pad thai and cream cheese rangoons. The rangoons are my favorite they were crispy with lots of delicious filling (just cream cheese and scallion) and they come with a sweet dipping sauce. I ate those puppies in the car omw home lol. Anyways total for everything came to about $35. It was a bit pricey for just one person but I figured I would make at least 2/3 meals out of everything so when u break it down its not bad at all.  I was disappointed with the pad thai it didn't have very much flavor. The panang curry was good and the spice level was just right. You can get it spiced from 1 to 10 with 10 being the hottest. I don't know how some people get a 10! I have also had the yellow curry chicken from there and I really enjoyed that. It comes with chunks of potatoes and carrots and I think bamboo but maybe u have to request that I can't remember. I have never dined in but the restaurant looks clean. The cashier who does the to-go could probably use a smile but that won't keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a hit or miss with the service the first time i came in it wasn't to great and the second time it was excellent! I had the lemongrass coconut milk based chicken soup, sounds weird but is so delicious! My family and friends enjoy it just as much! Ive literally been craving it for days now. I also had the chili mint, pad thai and curry panag. I will say the servings aren't as big as i am use to, then again the quality is also better. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY MY FRIEND. Cant wait to go back and try new dishes and get that soup again im in love. This is my new favorite Thai place !"}
{"text":"The best Chicken Pad Thai I've ever had.  And when the waitress came over and stirred it all up and added lime, WOW.  We also had the Spring rolls which were very fresh, and Basil Chicken with Spicy Eggplant.  Amazing dish and we are the whole eggplant, skin too.   If you want a great Thai meal, we recommend you eat here.  And the service is A1!l"}
{"text":"I went here twice with a group of friends and it reminded me of my time in Asia: Family style dining, attentive servers, abundance of food for a great price...it was about 2 years ago but I hope this hasn't changed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty good. I've had better for better pricing but the flavors are not that far from authentic, just a little bland. More variety on the menu would be nice, such as adding some more creative and unique twists to original recipes. Service is always pretty good as well worth a try but have had better."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a little bias because they are so close to me I go here a lot..but love this place. Great spot to dine in or do takeout for a group. Everytime I have family or friends in town and I want to feed a lg group..these guys take care of me. The menue is so awesome...so many tasty options.   The restaurant is kind of small..but that just adds to the authenticity of the place. They are the real deal...and they care about their customers.  You can tell they always got through extra care to make sure you get everything you want perfect.  If you get a chance...give them a try. Their kind of hidden, tucked out of the way.  I think that is why more people dont know about them which is fine with me. My secret littls spot!  Also..they a pretty fast. Not so fast tou know the food has been sitting out all day...just fast like they get the order and cook it up fast"}
{"text":"Preface: I don't think I've ever come here and been disappointed in the quality of the food.  Upon waking in, you're greeted by workers dressed in traditional Thai attire. My friends and I were seated promptly by a friendly server.  I usually order shrimp pad see ew but today I was craving rice and curry. The crab meat fried rice never disappoints! Such good flavor. And the chicken panang (not spicy) is my favorite curry. The coconut milk does it for me, lol. The Tom Kha (coconut soup) is a perfect mixture between sour and creamy. Practically anything with coconut milk in it is a win for me.  Definitely hits he spot if you're looking for big portions. Plate sizes are good for sharing with a group as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best thai food in town.The manager is so sweet and the coconut ice cream is amazing."}
{"text":"We always order food to go and the food is always great. Our go to dishes would be the yellow curry, pad Thai, and papaya salad. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"It was the Monday after Thanksgiving and my wife and I were a bit tired of the usual leftover fare, so we thought we'd step out for dinner-- after all, we had something special to celebrate. Days earlier we found out that we were expecting our very first child!! Thai sounded good, and based on recommendations from some local friends, we were off to Pin Kaow.  The atmosphere and ambiance were spot on. It was very nicely decorated, and very clean (which is one of the most important things for me when I go out-- I want to feel comfortable and at ease). The presentation of the food was lovely.  We ordered curry, steamed rice, and some (delicious) Pad See Ew. I haven't had very much Thai food before, but this was by far the best we'd had. The service was friendly and attentive. My water glass was NEVER empty which is a HUGE plus.  It was a great experience, and once the wife gets over her morning sickness, we'll head back!  EDIT: I went back for the 2nd time just recently (my wife has finally gotten over her morning sickness) and was super impressed about how I never saw the bottom of my water glass. It was constantly being refilled. LOVE THIS!"}
{"text":"Overly hyped. Small portions for high prices. Service was lacking. Food isn't all that great. Spice level sucks! Got 10 and it barely had a kick."}
{"text":"Great authentic food and service. Beautiful place and fair pricing. The food cake out fast and was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Friendly but extremely slow service. Spent over 2hr there and we didn't even have appetizers or dessert. No refills offered. Food was okay, found the massaman to be too sweet."}
{"text":"Had lunch and was pleasantly surprised.   Dim Sum was excellent!  They had a variety of everything you could think of.   The service was excellent and the prices were fair for what we ordered.   Its best to take friends so you can try several pots.  Looking forward to a return.  Exceptionally clean, properly lit and the food was hot.     Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"When your seven year old wants Pin Kaow on his Birthday then that's where we go. The experience is even better when the service and food is great! My grandson got some special birthday attention from the host. Not just a singing of happy birthday but also played guitar and sang a rousing version of Viva Las Vegas! You cannot help but be happy when you are treated with such good service! Viva Pin Kaow"}
{"text":"Visited this location the first time Saturday night with some friends and was pleased.  The inside d√©cor is very nice and the staff is dressed in cultural attire which adds a nice touch.  On the tables are multiple plates as entrees are to be \"family style.\"  I ordered the cashew chicken and was thankful we weren't the sharing type or else I might have only had a couple of bites!  The portions do seem small, especially for the price.  I guess you pay for the ambiance.  The taste overall was OK.  There were hardly any cashews (my fianc√© had the same problem with his kung pao chicken and peanuts) and the chicken's texture left a lot to be desired.  The vegetables were good at least.  They pile on the onions which I love but my fianc√© didn't since he's not obsessed with onions like I am, so be wary if you're anti-onion!  My water glass was always full, so one star for that alone.  -:P  I don't drink water because I'm cheap, I drink water because it's healthy and I love the taste more than any soda.  So having constant water is a HUGE plus for me.  I might go here every now and again, but this is definitely not in my list of regular restaurants..."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow used to be my favorite Thai Place in all of Vegas. But we moved away, and when we came back after 5 years we discovered that things had changed, and I'm afraid that it's not for the better.  To be fair, the place looks very pretty inside since the renovations, and the waitresses now wear traditional Thai attire, which is very cool.   But the food portions are MUCH smaller, and the food quality seems to have suffered a bit, as well. (perhaps the customers are now paying for the cost of renovations?) The Thai tea tasted like regular iced tea mixed with coffee, and nutrasweet. The spring rolls were lackluster and kind of pasty inside, and the chicken soup was VERY salty, which is a complaint that I rarely ever have, seeing as how I'm a card carrying salt fiend that has actually been known to add salt to TOAST. (I shit you, not.) The Pad See Ew and Pad Prik King were both TINY.  No, seriously....both were itty-bitty, teensy-weensy portions....maybe a cup worth of food per entree, at most. And honestly, the food just doesn't seem to be anywhere near as flavorful as it used it be. It was just kind of bland.  Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed, because this place used to be SO good! Luckily we found Thai Grill on N. Decatur, which is even better than the old Pin Kaow (which is saying a lot, because boy did Pin Kaow ever used to be good!)."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant. Great food, love the decor and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place their pad thi is the best, also the sweet and sour chicken, and can't ever go wrong with their dumplings omg delicious!"}
{"text":"Perfect night for outside dining...I ordered my Thai BBQ chicken with sweet sauce and rice and Pauline's favorite Spicy Basil Minced Chicken This place has never failed me...always a table me and my family"}
{"text":"The servers and hostesses are really rude! First time going never going back with my service. There is a ton of Thai places in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I have been ordering here for over 15 years. The prices keep going up and the quality of service and food goes down. We ordered 100.00 worth of food, waited an hour for delivery and order came without spices, flavor and rice. Apparently white rice is no longer included--even with 6 orders of various dishes. Fine, let people know when they call so they have the option to purchase it. Rude."}
{"text":"Tried the masaman curry. Very tasty! Many Thai places don't offer this style. Reasonable prices- better than other Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Date nite type place! So beautiful and fragrant!!"}
{"text":"This place is in a great location and has an awesome environment when you're inside. All of that considered, the food took about 20 minutes to come out and the place is not that busy. The food was not great either, a little tasteless and the portions are also pretty small. Service was good otherwise--but I don't think I'd eat here again in the future."}
{"text":"I used to come here every single time I wanted Thai. Always a winner. Then about 2 months ago something changed. Idk if they got a new chef or what, but my orders have had something wrong with them each and every time... like giving me pork pad thai even though  I asked and paid for chicken... or charging me for items that aren't delivered. Not a fan. I thought things had changed when I had a good experience about a month ago, but nope. Tried them twice since and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"If you have been to one Thai restaurant then you have been to them all, right?  Wrong.  Pin Kaow is to regular Thai places what Gordon Ramsay Steak is to burger joints...different ball park, different night, different game.  Now, I do have to admit that the decor and ambiance are very similar to many of the other Thai restaurants that I have experienced across the country.  In fact, many of these places seem to be designed and outfitted by the same person or company.  The staff at Pin Kaow is friendly, polite and professional.  The will work with you on areas of concern regarding the menu; in particular levels of heat desired for each dish.  The food is just light years better than any Thai food I have ever had.  I used to live near NYC, I have lived in Miami and Washington DC and this is quite frankly, the best Thai food I have ever had.  Fried Catfish Curry was absolutely spot on."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times usually order the chicken pad Thai level 9, spring rolls, rangoons, chicken satay, & now today Tom Yum soup w/shrimp (traditional in Thailand) & my jasmine hot tea.  Superb service as usual.."}
{"text":"Most recent, was just at Pin Kaow this afternoon, a delivery a few weeks ago. and perhaps about a month ago Prior to that, it had to have been at least 7-8 years since. Today's options were a lychee Thai tea, Thai beef salad, chicken panang curry, and crab fried rice. That lychee thai tea was something else, it combines the clean taste of lychee with Thai flavors from the tea. Steer away if you aren't into sweets cause hubby was so-so about it. That Thai beef salad is fiiiire. Extra lit. I got a spice level 3/10 and the veggies were fresh, the beef wasn't over done and tough (a pretty common issue), and the dressing was the total definition of that Thai balance of sweet, salty, spicy. My family and I live for that. Chicken panang curry was a bleh. It was cool, the depth of coconut richness was highly lacking. The 4/10 spice level was great. Soo that's what I'm knocking down for. The crab salad was a re-order and did not disappoint. Really, y'all gotta try it! I felt like they could have been a little more attentive to needs, such as needing more napkins or just checking in. But ehh, it was around 11:30am and I get the whole lunch rush thing."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Vegas. Hands down always consistently amazing and delicious. I love the ambiance and the flavor in the food. I just wish they had fresh spring rolls, they only have fried ones. Their Thai tea is sooooo good! Gotta get the pad Thai!"}
{"text":"I really was craving some Thai food so I wanted to give Pin Kaow a try. The catch is I didn't have a lot of time for a sit down meal. So I did what any sensible person would do and called up to place a pick up order.   The staff was very professional when I asked about gluten free options which is a double bonus and deserving of a gold star ! They took down my info, the order was ready when the promised, and very warm fresh off the wok !   I ordered the chicken pad Thai and my mom wanted the spicy basil chicken gluten free style. The spicy levels are one to ten. We were both very happy with the size and quality of our to go order !"}
{"text":"Solid Red Curry w/Tofu, got it at a 7 spice level (out of 10) and it was spicy enough without being overpowering. The Red Curry itself was on the thicker side and of medium sweetness. A little cheap on the Tofu and heavy on the Bamboo Shoots, though. Got it as part of the lunch special (7.95) which came with a spring roll, crab rangoon and a free cup of soup. The soup was a broken rice chicken soup - unfortunately it was very salty, and the spring roll was fresh but standard issue - nothing special.   Enjoyed the Red Curry, but was most taken aback by the surprise +$3 charge for each Brown Rice substitution. Our bill showed up with two lunch specials and a +$6 charge for two Brown Rice substitutions. The Manager offered to remove one of the rice charges, which was reasonable, considering the waitress did not mention that there would be an upcharge. I do consider +$3 for a Brown Rice substitution a deal-breaker when it comes to lunch specials, especially when there are many similar Thai options at around $7-8, all-in.   Dinner prices are $10-13 for the curries, and based on our experience today, expect to pay at least $3 for Brown Rice. If you happen to ask for a little more rice, I bet they ring you up for another $3 cup.  I would like to try their Massaman curry, as our waitress said it is her favorite.  The atmosphere IS impressive, warmly decorated and built entirely of wood: wood paneling, wood floors, and wood trim. The goldfish aquarium along the back wall is spotless, and the bathrooms are clean. They certainly take pride in their shop. I can see taking a client here or someone going on a date here, occasions when nickel-and-diming don't matter.   Weera Thai is still my top-slot Thai place for value, taste, and service. Mad at myself for not taking advantage of double-punch-Mondays at Which Wich today instead (1 block north of Pin Kaow.)"}
{"text":"food is great. we eat here pretty often when we want Thai food. Wanted Yen ta fo soup and this is one of only two places in Henderson that I know serves it.  It came out hot and fresh but took over 30 min. to get prepared. good thing we weren't in a hurry. If you want a quick lunch order from the specials. I think the prices have increased slightly since the last time we were here but so have everywhere else."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food. I recommend all of it! The pad Thai is my favorite as is the green papaya salad."}
{"text":"Just an update!  We've been eating pretty much the staples here - Pad Thai, Panang, and the must-have Chili Mint Noodles.  Last night we decided to deviate from the usual and ordered the Duck Basil.  B.L.O.W.N. A.W.A.Y.  Seriously, this is the best preparation of duck I've ever had!    Thinly sliced boneless duck, cooked up with basil, onion, jalapeno and bell pepper in a yummy Thai sauce.  The flavors in the preparation were the perfect foil against the usually forward duck flavor.  Deep, but not gamey at all.  Brilliant."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this establishment. I had read the reviews to get some idea of what I should expect. Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed the cleanliness and was immediately put at ease. Service was good. Food was good. I had the Kung Pao Chicken. The Crab Rangoons were delicious, more so because they were full, unlike other restaurants. They have an appetizer, beef jerky, and it is to DIE for. I swear it is meat \"crack\" and I was addicted after the first bite. I don't care about any of the other food. I will be going back for that beef jerky. I will probably have dreams about it. I would have given them 5 stars, but I was bothered slightly by all of the employees hovering around. I understand wanting to be attentive to guests' needs, but it was just a bit too much for me. Still, they are definitely worth trying. And I cannot emphasize it enough, TRY THE BEEF JERKY!"}
{"text":"So I came here for lunch with my girl an it was very good I'll start with the foo I got the chicken fried rice lunch special It came with the soup of the day an a Asian green salad. The soup was a cucumber chicken soup not really my thing I'm not a huge fan of cucumbers, but as far as the chicken fried rice it was very good An had a great flavor an a large portion. The salad that came with it was also delicious even I could have used a bit more dressing which was magnificent all in all I give it a 5 stars becuz the portion was great an the taste great an you can beat that for $8.79."}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever!  We love to go here frequently!    Be sure to get the chicken pot stickers, red curry and green papaya salad with no shrimp and no crab."}
{"text":"SOO good!  My husband's stepmother is actually from Thailand, and she took us here and ordered for us.  Everything was delicious, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Yen-Ta Fo, great soup highly recommended, only down fall of our meal was the slow service, slow with water refills and slow on checking on us, couple be change from lunch to dinner service time"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place an extra star because their beef jerky appetizer was delicious but sadly all the other dishes were bland and lacking a true Thai flare. We ordered the Tom Yum soup, Pad Woon Sen noodles, and mixed vegetables with beef. The meat in all of the dishes weren't seasoned and to me unseasoned meat = yuck. We'll only come back here to get the beef jerky To Go."}
{"text":"Lunch with the Madre and her work folk and I can never say no to Thai food.  We arrived just before the lunch rush, thankfully because I was famished.  Vegitable spring rolls for an appetizer (delish!) and it was a close tie between garlic chicken or pad thai.. Pad thai won the decision by a nose.    I ordered a level 4 spice but I think the young Miss taking my order skipped that bit of information because my dish lacked spice completely.  This could have been a total taste-bud disaster but luckily the noodles were flavored to perfection, spice-less and all.  All in all the service was super and the eats were delish. If I'm ever on the north side again and in the mood for Thai, Pin Kaow will be on my list."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Thai place to go to , I always order the spicy basil chicken and the crab ragoons and the staff are so sweet. I love that it's just an amazing all around place to eat."}
{"text":"It's always been okay Thai food (not the best) but unfortunately I had the experience of finding a bug in the curry tonight. Well, my boyfriend found it. His face suddenly turned to disgust and when I looked at his plate no mistakenly was a pretty long leg of what looked like a cricket. There was no denying it because it was still attached to the pelvic region of the insect. I'm a pretty forgiving person but that's incredibly unsanitary. Makes me worry about what goes on back there."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  The service is fast and the food is fantastic.  Among our favorites are the Pad Thai, Red Curry, and the Tom Ka Kai soup.  They have a scale for how spicy you want your food that goes from 1 to 10.  Not only that, but it is very inexpensive."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! When you first walk in the place is beautiful. With traditional Thai architecture and decorations. We didnt have to wait and we were a party of 4. We had the chicken coconut soup which a about amazing and then we ordered thai curry, pah thai, chicken fried rice and short ribs. All were delicious and completely satisfying. We definitely will be coming back !!"}
{"text":"Love the Tom Ka Kai soup, and the fried won tons. The green curry is good also.  Killer Thai iced tea!"}
{"text":"The tofu mango salad is to die for!!! I often crave it, their pad Thai is by far the best in town."}
{"text":"The staff was good & attentive. The food was good too. I didn't give 4/5 stars because my husband ordered level 4 spicy in his food and it wasn't spicy. The food was flavorful. I got the shrimp & asparagus dish and it was awesome. My picky son even ate a lot of his meal. My brother had a coconut curry soup that was pretty tasty too. My sister in law loves this place for good reason. My husband who holds a high standard about food loved his garlic and chicken dish even though it wasn't as spicy as he wanted.  I would come back if given the opportunity and recommend it to others with a note about their spice scale being tamed."}
{"text":"Best thai place around.  We love their pad thai and coconut soup. Always pretty fast if you deliver too."}
{"text":"I always eat here at this restaurant it is delicious. Everything test perfect and nice. I love eating here."}
{"text":"The lunch specials seem awesome, but the food isnt that great.I felt like everything was missing flavor. I had the beef Thai salad with pad Thai. I also got a Thai tea. Pad thai was horrible. I love pad Thai and have tried it in many places. It lacked so much flavor. Service was good. They were all very attentive. I'm not a fan with waiters coming up and just asking what we want:/ but that's fine. Unfortunately I won't be returning. This place gets so many raves but prommares is 100 times better!"}
{"text":"We started off with a welcoming staff and they gave our family a nice quiet table. The ambiance was relaxing and very quiet, we had to keep telling our kids to whisper and use inside voices. We ordered the Tom Kha with chicken and it was amazing I could have gone with more spice in the soup but I never know how true to scale the 1-10 hotness scale is so I played it safe at a 5. We also had the Chicken Satay. It was pretty typical run of the mill Satay- it was very good and what we expected. For entrees I ordered the Duck Curry which was great! It had pineapple in the sauce which I surprisingly liked. At a spice level of 6 it was perfect. It had alot of meat too which is rare when ordering duck in a curry. My husband got the barbeque chicken and the presentation was fun. It came out sizzling on a platter served with white rice. One downside is there is no kids menu but we were able to share with them and make it work. Overall we had great service and food."}
{"text":"After hearing that Pin Kao was the best in town,  I was pretty disappointed.  Food quality was mediocre,  vegetables in food seemed to be odd ; peas and carrots were the vegetables in the chicken for lettuce wraps.  They strongly resembeld the frozen kind that you can get at the grocery store.  The other Thai restaurants that I have been to have much better food and have much better pricing than Pin Kaow."}
{"text":"This place is so not Thai. :(  I honestly think they're Thai/Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly people. Good food. Quick service.  I asked for my hell curry to be very spicy but it had very little spice to it. I think because I'm white they don't make it as spicy as normal."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place, but now, I wouldn't go back! We ordered both beef and chicken pad Thai and the beef tasted like spaghetti sauce, ordered it a 5 out of 10 on a spice level, no hint of spice.  The chicken had no flavor and the chicken was so over done it was like chicken jerky!  That was ordered a 7 spice level and no spice either? So incredibly disappointed.  Wasted $22! Don't waste your time, go to Archie's!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Every time I eat here they are spot on. The restaurant itself is very nice, good date place. I always gravitate towards the chicken panang curry, cream cheese wonton appetizer, and either a Thai iced tea or a coconut to drink."}
{"text":"this is the best restaurant i have ever been to in my entire life. i used to go there like every week. it is SOOOOO GOOD. the pork fried rice is definitely my favorite, but pretty much everything i've tried there has been amazing and it's always consistent.  the staff is also really friendly and great and the atmosphere is really well done and kind of romantic. pin kaow will always be a favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff! Great food. Usually go to the location in Las Vegas but this place is just as great."}
{"text":"They have the best spicy fried rice. A little pricey but i haven't eaten anything there that wasn't good!"}
{"text":"Pin Kaow does a lot a real good Thai dishes...almost everything I've ever had here was better than average.  The problem is that there isn't one dish that I want to come here for specifically.  I have 6 or 7 Thai dishes that I eat regularly and several more that I eat when I want to change things up, and in every case I can think of somewhere else I'd rather go...it's weird, but true.  They probably do massaman or panang best in my opinion.    Still I will gladly come here, especially with a group because I know that the overall quality will be good and has always been consistent.  The service is friendly and they are quick....especially during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"The good.. 1) Great atmosphere 2) Good Service 3) Great food - Fresh 4) Clean 5) Reasonably priced.  The bad.. 1) Not much to complain about.  We were on our way  to the Jenni Pho Vietnamese restaurant  when we decided to try something new and ended up coming here instead. This is one of the best Thai restaurants in town over Nittayas Secret Kitchen, Archies and Basil & Lime."}
{"text":"Really yummy curry and quick polite service. Definitely a place to eat."}
{"text":"I  love this place is authentic Thai I order the Pad Thai spicy and spring rolls very good service ,fast and the portions are big Thank U I will definitely return back  :)"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, strange music. I actually heard an Asian style insturmental version of Biz Markie's \" You got what I need\".   Do yourself a favor .... order the Duck Mint.   Very tasty."}
{"text":"I'm a regular to Pin Kaow on N. Rainbow and always get a good meal with great service.  The decor is fantastic and authentic, the food is excellent.  The Pad Thai lunch special is my staple dish and it is always tasty.   The curry dish with coconut milk is also very good, but more food than I can eat for lunch."}
{"text":"What a pleasant little Thai restaurant tucked into the Sansone Parkplace off the strip. My family and I stopped by for lunch and were immediately impressed by the beautiful decor and classy interior.   Since it was a holiday, the lunch specials were not available; however, they are usually available Monday - Friday from 11am - 3pm and only $7.95 for an entree, soup, egg roll & fried wonton. What a great deal!   Since we ordered from the regular menu, I tried the pad Thai w/ tofu for $9.95 and my parents tried the spicy mint beef w/ rice. Spice levels range from 1-10: order 4 for a mild spice. The food was pretty delicious! We were impressed with the flavors and portion sizes given the reasonable prices.   The service was excellent. Our waiter, Bon, was perfectly hospitable and polite and we had a constant stream of servers stopping by to refill our water and ask if we needed anything else.   I would definitely recommend this Thai restaurant if you're looking for authentic, reasonably-priced Thai food in a classy environment off the strip."}
{"text":"Really didn't think it was anthing special, but the food was good and it was served fast. Not much more to say. If I was in the mood for Thai I would go back unless I found a better place on Yelp."}
{"text":"What a great meal. Loved the authentic dress of the wait staff. Very friendly and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"First time I had I fell in love !! Great good and great prices !! You really can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai around! This is the one place my girl and I always agree on for dinner. Chili mint noodles are supper tasty and that's what I get every single time. I'm told everything else tastes good too lol they are very nice and always good service."}
{"text":"The raspberry tea and chicken pad Thai was delicious. So was the cucumber salad.  They have an outdoor seating area. Service a little slow. Yellow curry with rice was also good. The atmosphere was like being in Thailand. They accept Apple Pay. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat Tai food but this place was very good and very good service. I recommend it."}
{"text":"We recently visited Thailand to try out one of our favorite dish which is Pad Thai, and I must say Pinkaow definitely brought out the true flavor of Thai Cuisine! If you come to visit Vegas and love Thai Food, you can't miss this. Highly recommended! Especially their Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service,  great price... Went here today with my GF to celebrate her final military deployment and they were amazballz. The service was absolutely perfect, we were greeted and brought water and our drinks within one minute of stepping inside. I was asked 4 or 5 times if eveything was ok, and it was.  I had the soft shell crab and my GF had chicken curry. The softshell crab was seriously amazing. I love softshell crab and they did it just right! The curry was also great and for the price... we spent only $40 for two meals, an appatizer and two drinks. I was expecting a check for at least $60 (which would have been the case had we gone to Lotus Siam, my second favorite place)"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The staff was so friendly, welcoming and the food was superb! The sangria is a must try and their vegetarian dishes are amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai at a great price. Spring Rolls came out piping hot and delicious. Chicken Pad Thai was excellent. One of the best. Worth an Uber ride out of the strip when looking for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Terrible thai food. Don't venture past the pad thai.  Not cheap either."}
{"text":"I've visited this establishment twice. The first time the staff was very rude when inquired as to the mushrooms in my meal. I had ordered a meal without mushrooms (I dislike them as much as kids dislike veggies). I asked my question with courtesy and kindness and was met with rudeness.  The manager came to my table and pushed the menu up in my face and pointed with emphasis that what I ordered indeed had mushrooms-she was angry that I asked. Then when I asked for a sauce to cover up the mushrooms to lessen the taste, she refused.  * About six months later I gave them a second chance because my girlfriend likes a certain dish they make. This time around I made certain to carefully read what the dish I was ordering contained. The meal came and the chicken tasted like it had freezer burn and was very poor quality and near expiration. I left the meal there and didn't eat it at all, waiting for my girlfriend to finish the dish she enjoys. They didn't ask why I wasn't eating it and as usual seemed troubled to even smile or thank us for visiting. If you wonder why I didn't complain, well, I didn't want to be publicly yelled at again by management. I won't return."}
{"text":"Here's yet another example of what's becoming almost a stereotype: Tasty Thai food smack dab in the middle of a non-descript strip mall. Nice decor and ambiance."}
{"text":"In love with this restaurant !! They offer great food and great service! & always checking on you to make sure everything is good or if you need something! I love their chicken pad Thai it's one of my must haves every time I go ! Especially their lemon chicken omg so yummy."}
{"text":"Fancy dining for cheap. Very nice place. Good atmosphere. Good decor. Good service. Good food. Wayyyy cheaper than it feels. One of the best bang for ur buck in Vegas."}
{"text":"LOVE, love, love this place. BUT after waiting 1.5 hours for our delivery, I've decided to either 1. Never order delivery from here again or 2. That I need to take a break from this establishment.   Don't offer delivery if you're not able to deliver within an hour. We paid $85 for food that was basically cold by the time it got here. There are so many great restaurants that deliver in Las Vegas, I would rethink ordering delivery from here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Great Service, Great food! Nice upscale restaurant. I love their food, especially all their fried rice dishes. Little on the pricey side but not bad. Can be a bit busy at times (sign of a good restaurant). :)"}
{"text":"Penang Curry was so yummy about to lick the plate clean =) but the chicken was very dry (over cook chicken) =\ Order a few more dishes and all the meats & seafood was a over cook (hard & dry not tender or juicy meat/seafood) Ate mostly sauce & rice."}
{"text":"We had red curry with pineapple & this fried rice noodle with chinese broccoli & egg.  They were both delicious!!  The decor was cool and exotic.  The servers were dressed in traditional outfits.  Overall, it was a good experience and we do plan on going back."}
{"text":"The menu is vast and we've had a good sampling of it over the years including Tom Ka Koong, Tom Ka Kai, Larb salad, pot stickers, and fried trout lemon grass. All of which I would recommend without hesitation. I've eaten the red, green and panang curries which are usually all good. On my last trip I ordered the panang curry and it was a bit disappointing as the chicken and green beans were over cooked and a bit short on the red pepper slices.  The walls are finished with wood paneling and carvings which are 1 part traditional and 1 part dated but its a nice break from the ultra hip granite steel and marble of vegas' upscale dining scene. Well known tunes from the last 3 decades seep out of the speakers at a level which doesn't interfere with conversations. Even at near capacity, the room is still quiet enough to feel relaxed but energized. I requested booth seating and the hostess guided me to the one remaining spot. Gracious considering that several parties came in after me and I was taking up a four top alone. Years ago when I first found Pin Kaow, service was slow and you likely had to ask when you were ready for your check. It seems that feedback from customers has shaped the restaurant into a more western service style, wait staff make frequent visits and your check comes as soon as  you are finished. The jury's still out on whether this is an improvement as there's something to be said about the Thai pace of dinner.  I thanked the waitress for bringing me a chang with one of four mangled Thai phrases I've memorized. She pressed her palms together in an elegant wai and said \"kaa\". The shift ended for my waitress and my desert was served by a waiter who was just as polite. The manager kept an eye on all tables and greeted customers as they were seated.  If you live in Henderson or South Vegas this restaurant is easy to reach and prices, food and service all rate well. Bookmark now and stop in for dinner some time. They also have a well placed outdoor seating area. Saa-waa-dee kaap."}
{"text":"This place use to be great but on Monday night I called to have some food delivered I called at 4:30 the women on the phone was so rude I should have just hung up and called another place!! But I did not she told me I would not get the food until around 6 I said fine so we waited around 5:50 our food arrived I placed everything on the table and opened it up everything was room temp I was shocked! How dare them have us wait and to serve our food cold. I called them and the rude lady answered the phone again did not want to transfer me to manager finally she did but the manager did not even care all she kept say was what do you want me to do?? ignorant people work here and have no clue on what customer service is I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AGAIN 55.00 bucks down the drain this place SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"All the flavors that I'm use to;  turned down a few notches mind you, but all and all, I'm going to have to give this place a \"good shit\" rating!! However, you're going to be paying way too much for the food.  So, would I go back....? Probably not.. just cause I can find better for less and can make the majority of my favorites at home."}
{"text":"We didn't get to the food. We walked in and it was absolutely frigid in there. And I mean frigid like 65 degrees. The people behind us exclaimed the same thing. Asked to staff to raise the temp & they said they couldn't cuz the kitchen would get too hot. I knew I'd be miserable, so we left."}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and stick with the basics, they're good.  Don't ask the waiter or waitress for advice though.  They suggest the most expensive dishes on the menu, and if you make the mistake that I did of ordering them, they are terrible, and I mean terrible.  I'm still giving them a 4 because I should know better, and their food if you stick to regular thai food is good."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for lunch. Lunch special is very filling. Soup, egg roll, wonton and the entree.  I get the tofu pad thai and my boyfriend gets pork fried rice. They open at 11 and we get there early and wait for them to open. It fills up quick for the lunch rush. We've only gone during the week so I could imagine the weekend being even busier. Service is great!"}
{"text":"First time I have been here was today and it was easily the best Thai food I have had in Vegas.  The ambience and service were awesome as well!  Reccomending it to everyone i know:)"}
{"text":"Perhaps the most overrated Thai restaurant in Vegas, Pin Kaow was a disappointment for me.  I ordered the Rad Na (Lad Na).  It was very bland, even with chili added to it.  I tasted my friend's yellow curry, and it was generic with sweetness and no real character or authentic flavor.  The crab rangoon was pretty good, very sweet and fried well.  However, I've had much better Thai food at numerous places in Las Vegas. Prommares kills this place, and even though Thai Grill isn't as good as it used to be, it is still better than Pin-Kaow and is just down the street on Lake Mead and Decatur.    We had to wait 15 minutes outside before we were seated, and we were only seated after we went *back* into the establishment, asked for tables again, and split up our rather large party of 8 people.  The place was packed... with non-asians.  This doesn't always mean anything, but after tasting real authentic Thai food for years at Thai Grill when it was good, I can safely say that the food at Pin Koaw is geared towards Americans who probably don't know the difference."}
{"text":"Based on the total numbers of reviews....you can already tell this place is popular. I did not say it's a great place to go because everyone experienced something different than the next reviewer.  But I can tell you this; lunch specials were fantastic!!!! You get their soup of the day which consist of chunks of beef, veggies and tofu. The broth....yum! PERFECT for a  cold day. Next, you get to choose between an egg roll or salad. We also order chicken pad Thai and beef fried rice.  Lunch portion can be a hit or miss....really depends on who's cooking that day. Our first time here...our lunch portions were satisfying. But the last few times...it kept shrinking. Also,  their spiciness is a hit or miss. One time I ordered a spiciness of level 6 and it was NOT spicy at all. Very disappointing. So we can see....consistency is off here. Hence, the 4 star rating.   One of the better Thai restaurants here on this side of town."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. We always order from here and get delivery. Sometimes pick up as well! The food is absolutely fresh and delicious. I usually get the spicy basil w/ steamed tofu, beef jerky, edamame along with Thai tea. Their Mongolian with chicken or beef is amazing too! Their spring rolls are yummy, and ALL of their salads. I haven't tried everything just yet, but those are usually what I order. Just recently found out they don't take delivery orders passed 9:30 which is cool, but then we got informed they aren't going to deliver to us anymore after we've ordered countless times. Hopefully they don't change their \" mileage \" radius because we are most definitely loyal customers. Always recommending to friends and family !"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great good, love the ambiance and orchids. Happy place Are you wondering where the best Thai food is in Henderson area? Here it is!"}
{"text":"Second time here for lunch... the first time was so good, I came back!  The first time I had the Tom Yum Kai soup, egg rolls and pot stickers, my daughters and I all shared. We all 3 enjoyed it. Great tasting soup, crispy eggrolls and the pot stickers were pan fried just right.   Last week, I took my father here for lunch. They have several lunch specials to choose from...  i ordered the pad thai, just the right amount of spice and sweetness, nice size portion served with soup, egg roll & wonton. Soup of the day was chicken tofu.. pretty basic, chicken stock, a little bit of ground chicken & tofu.   My dad ordered the Ginger Beef, it looked and smelled delicious, and tasted great..  Tender pieces of beef, mixed with vegetables in an oyster sauce seasoned with ginger. Yum.   Atmosphere is nice, staff was friendly and helpful in ordering.. Only complaint, we had a dirty knife in our table setting."}
{"text":"My favorite thai place on the planet!!! My family makes it a point to come here several times a month. We hardly look at the menu because we have it memorized just about! Friendly staff and amazing food! We typically order spring rolls, fried wontons, red curry, pad see ew, basil chicken wraps, and the fried catfish (all delicious)."}
{"text":"We never had a bad meal there. The atmosphere is great, I love the outside patio. I love the yellow curry and calamari appetizer . Also , it is very clean!"}
{"text":"Not too impress with the service. Yelp offer free Thai tea, we'll, partly is my fault as I ordered first and server said can not use unless order for 2nd drink. But the truth is she is lazy, can cancel it and what so hard about it, right? This make me don't want to give tip anymore, it's ok I just deduct from her tip lol"}
{"text":"OOOOHHHHH Man...Oh Man. Some things just don't get sexier than red curry. Red curry paste, coconut milk, Thai chilies, bamboo shoots and chicken with a side or white rice. Really guys, REALLY! SO SO GOOD.  OK I may be getting a head of myself by giving this institution 5 stars with only one visit, but it truly was that freaking good. I wish there was more to say, but there really isn't.  The place was clean, the service was good, price was fair and the red curry was out of this world. When ordering the curry they give you a choice of 1 - 10 on the heat scale, I chose an 8 and it was perfect. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place has the best Thai food!  The staff is always polite, the food is priced well, and the red curry with beef is fantastic. Also, their establishments are beautiful. It looks like they spent a fortune on fine woodwork."}
{"text":"Tried this Pin Kao last night...ordered the Stuffed Chicken Wing appetizer, chicken Pad Thai, Duck Fried Rice, and Pin Kao tilapia. The Stuffed Chicken wing was mediocre, as the filling was very bland and the outside wasn't very crispy. Still no one can beat the Wings of Angel at Thai BBQ. The Chicken Pad thai was good, and they gave us extra crushed peanuts like we requested. The Duck fried rice was decent, although the rice was too wet, leading it to be  a bit mushy. But big pieces of roast duck were in the fried rice. The Pin Kao tilapia was also rather bland. I prefer the fish (pompano) at Thai BBQ. This tilapia wasn't whole, but rather filets which made it more convenient to eat. Overall, I prefer the taste of Thai BBQ on Rainbow and Flamingo any day of the week."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times. I always enjoy the yellow curry, wor wonton soup and egg rolls. It's got some outdoor seating as well. Today I had their crispy red snapper and it was very delicious. It's a nice local Thai restaurant that delivers as well. My only complaint is they can be slow to serve initially. But once they get started the service is always pleasant and good very solid."}
{"text":"The food was great and the Curry Puffs was out of this world!!! The combo fried rice, broccoli duck and pad Thai noodles with extra peanut sauce OMG!!"}
{"text":"I loved everything we ordered here. I have always eaten on the strip, but this time, it was a locals visit so we went to the M resort, and then ate here at Pin Kaow for dinner before heading to the strip to party.   We ordered green curry, beef jerky, papaya salad with crab, and fried rice with shrimp. The curry was spicy but perfectly so at 7 spice level, the papaya salad was spicy too and well shredded. The beef jerky was delicious and not too hard. And the fried rice was so addicting.   The thai tea was just normal, but with all the yummy food, it still tasted great. I'm still craving it right now, 2 days after."}
{"text":"This has been the goto place for Thai in Henderson for us for years. Nothing else is even close to this quality...until now. Ordered our fav, crab fried rice, and the crab was rotten, and I mean super strong fish smell, slimy, gone bad in the sun on the beach for a week, smelled it at the door in the drivers hands, rotten. I was shocked. Im giving them 2 stars just because they were so good before now and they did give me a refund on the order and took the food back. So sad, this was the only great Thai(comparable with West coast Thai) in Henderson. To serve something like that is inexcusable, there is no way any decent cook would think that was passable seafood. Stay away for your own health."}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten takeout from Pinkaow. I've ordered lots of things on the menu and I think the Mango Salad might be the best thing I've had. The other dishes we usually get are just alright-- chicken pad thai, shrimp and veggies, yellow curry, etc. We order a level 7, which doesn't seem that spicy. It's convenient to order from though, and not super expensive, but I wouldn't regularly eat here otherwise."}
{"text":"Amazing food...everything we ordered tasted perfect!  Green curry, chicken pad Thai, Mongolian beef, spring rolls.  Only the cucumber salad was great but hot!  I"}
{"text":"This place has some really good food. I have only been here twice. Love the Tom yum soup. Has friendly staff and a great out door patio. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered their pad Thai to go and as you can see the noodles are twice the size of normal pad Thai noodles because they are overcooked and mushy...   The color of it is really bland too... Meaning they don't put enough sauce... So disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas period. I'm not even a huge Thai food fan but this place never disappoints. Pad Thai and Tom yum goong soup are my favorites. Did notice at 6:30 on a Saturday that 10 minute wait was no problem , but there is no room to wait anywhere inside. That I'm sure is only a problem cause how awesome this place is, but if you have large party or children maybe make reservation ."}
{"text":"In my opinion,  Pin Koaw is the best Thai restaurant in the Las Vegas Valley region.  The restaurant is located in a commercial strip on the southeast corner of Rainbow & Lake Mead. The space is fairly large with teak tables & accents. I've eaten here at least ten times during the past five years.    My favorite dish is the larb gai (chopped chicken) with fresh veggies.  It's served with lettuce leaves to eat as a wrap. I order it as an off-menu item entr√©e. The entr√©e will come with a serving of deliciously fragrant Thai rice. Spicy  larb gai and cold  Singha ( Thai beer) is a great pairing.  Yesterday, my family of nine decided to meet up here for lunch. I enjoyed the  Pad Thai lunch  w/ tofu special.  The dish- Rice noodles saut√©ed with bean sprouts, green onion, egg and crushed peanuts in Thai special recipe. Delicious! My meal is prepped at an eight spice level (one  to ten spice scale), gage it, and add more chili, if needed. Yes, I like my food spicy.  An egg drop soup is served for starters. Fantastic lunch deal for $8.95.   The service is warm & polite. My siblings and family really enjoy this  place for Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Their portions are a bit small since we were planning on sharing everything family style, but other than that it was AMAZING.  Pad Thai: SO GOOD with the right amount of flavor Tom Yum: Their broth was very flavorful with the right amount of spicy kick.  Yellow Curry: You can never go wrong ordering this. Its a bit thick and has a lot of coconut milk but it was very good!  Pad See Ew: Very good. We got it with fried tofu. Yum! Pineapple Fried Rice: actually comes served in a pineapple!! It was really good with raisins and cashews mixed in too. I almost didn't want to eat it, it looked so pretty.   And have your meal with a Thai Ice Tea. Delicious. The staff was very attentive and very helpful when we didn't exactly know what to order. You'll see me eating here again."}
{"text":"The first thing I HAVE to say about this place is don't judge a book by its cover!  The outside of the restaurant and its location could lead one to believe that it was going to be disappointing inside (to be honest I only went because of the yelp reviews) and then I walked in and BAM! I was blown away.  It was so nicely decorated, it had a very rich/authentic feel to the place.  The staff was over the top friendly, the food was simply divine, and the Bellini (champagne and pureed berry) was off the chain!    My friend and I had pot stickers and spring rolls for apptz - delicious and hot- quickly came out as well.  Main course for lunch for me was the Shrimp Chili Mint Noodles, it had so many good reviews, YUM YUM YUM. I had it on heat 8 (I have a spicy palate, but next time I'm going to 10, it was spicy but I wanted more) .  My friend had the Pad Thai and the only thing I can say about that is, I have never liked Pad Thai, I thought it was gross and hated that peanut flavor to it, this Pad Thai was so freaking good, I'm pretty sure I'm getting this next time, seriously!   If you are around this place, craving a little ethnic food in your life, and Thai sounds good, don't pass this place, you'll be crying like a baby caused you missed it!"}
{"text":"Super delicious Pad Thai and Thai Iced Tea. Will definitely go back any time I'm on that side of town. Very good prices on lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"It's definitely A-OK only. Maybe it was a bad experience. Had a tummy ache afterwards and so did my sister. It must've been the tom-yum soup. Anyways, we went the day before Xmas so we kind of felt rushed out with them mopping the floor. Good thing is that the food taste like Thai food but NOTHING exceptional. Your typical place. I wouldn't run back there tomorrow but would consider take-out for a friday night :)."}
{"text":"LOVE the curry dishes!  Grt. food and grt. service!  L."}
{"text":"(Red curry review) I was recommended this restaurant by a friend. She said they have the best curry in town. I had to try this place out because I'm a huge fan of red curry. I ordered maximum spice level as usual. When I tasted it, it tasted like spice level 2 or 3... I sent it back, the curry came back cold (not ice cold but warmer cold), and it had some sort of weird flavor. I can not explain but it kind of smelled... I couldn't eat it. The service was very good. The manger walks around and greet to every customer."}
{"text":"This place is great! My fiancee and I come here often. We love the Tom Ka Kai (chicken coconut soup with mushrooms)my fiancee and I get it spicy. We also love the chicken Pad Thai, and their fried rice is really good. Sometimes I have trouble deciding which rice so we go with the pineapple fried rice and the house fried rice. The Panang curry is really good too but if its just the 2 of us we cant usually eat more than the soup, rice, and noodles. We always have enough to take home even though we would like to eat all of it there. When the mango is in season we don't leave with out having the sweet sticky rice with mango and coconut milk. The ambiance makes you feel like you are in Thailand and the staff is always friendly and helpful. You might have to wait a few minutes getting in on a Friday or Saturday night but it is worth it."}
{"text":"This is probably the worse Thai place I've been to in Vegas. The only reason we finished our food was because we were both really hungry and I hate seeing food go to waste.   Let me start with the service. We were greeted and sat down pretty quickly. Our waiter took our food order and that's pretty much the end of seeing him. Someone else brought our food out and not once did he check if everything was ok. The bf needed chili for his food and it took us forever to flag down anyone to bring it to us. Every other table around us had the little chili condiment plate except for us, so the bf started to get irritated. The food was equally disappointing as well.   Mee krob: crunchy noodles covered in oyster sauce with shrimp and chicken. Way too sweet for any noodle dish. It only had 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 tiny pieces of chicken.   Tom yum with shrimp: traditional lemongrass soup served with shrimp, mushrooms and tomatoes. This was the highlight of the meal. Spicy, sour goodness. Only downside was that it was served as a hot pot and you could smell the gas burning underneath to keep the soup hot. The gas fumes were not very pleasant while eating.   Brown rice: hard and old tasting.   Chicken panang: Thai curry with coconut milk. Let's just say their version was very bland. I've had much better panang elsewhere.   Overall, this was a pretty crappy dinner the bf and I have had in a while. Would definitely not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the past month but have been a long time fan of Pin Kaow for years.   My favorite menu item is the Tom kha, the aromatics they use are profoundly authentic to the flavors of Thailand.  Long live the lime leaves & lemon grass shoots!    Always great service, the bathrooms are kept immaculately clean, the ambiance set well with attractive decor making the environment is comfortable.   I really dig the mango & sticky rice.   yum!"}
{"text":"Pin Kaow has been a restaurant we go to on the regular. Food is always great but the customer service has always been just ok. Nothin spectacular! On Valentine's Day I placed a to go order. Received a email confirmation saying \"Thank you for placing an order\" and \"your order is being processed\" at 5:48pm. My husband arrives to pick up at 6:30 when the man named (Jeb) tells him they didn't receive our order, then argues with him telling him the order was not complete. We told him about the emails we received and he still continues to say the order isn't complete. Then shows my husband the screen and our order is complete they just didn't enter it correctly. After showing him the order he tells my husband- Do you still want it? Well- of course we want it. My husband had to wait an additional 25 mins then has the nerve to say he will not charge us for the Pot Stickers which are $7.95, which is the cheapest item we ordered and our order total was $61.43. Talk about HORRIBLE customer service!! We will never go back to Pin Kaow again!! Very furious with their awful customer service!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place in the area. I first went here on the recommendation of a local resident, and was skeptical when I saw the outside. The food is EXCELLENT. Myself, and many of the people I travel with keep hoping we can get sent back to Vegas just to go here!"}
{"text":"The food was great! MY wife and I had red chicken curry and pad Thai. We shared pot-stickers with our daughter. The staff was very nice.  The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is that it was quite a wait to get our food, even though it's a small restaurant.  We waited about 30 mins after we ordered for our food to come out, and all 3 dishes came out separate.  Don't let that discourage you though! The pot-stickers were the best I've had. Both our dishes were great, and we even split a jasmine tea that finished the meal perfectly.  It was fairly cheap, especially for the food you're getting. They're not huge portions, but not small either, just the right size.  Go check this place out!! Very good food!"}
{"text":"Everytime I am sick I go get the chicken soup. Amazing and always makes me feel better. OK customer service but amazing food."}
{"text":"One my favorite restaurants in town. I usually get the green or yellow curry. They ask you 1-10 how spicy you'd like it. The flavors of the dish hit the spot every single time. The staff are great and the atmosphere is very welcoming. The alcoholic drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's clean, nice, and best of all the service was great. I ordered the masaman and my man ordered the pad Thai. Both dishes deserved an award. Lol"}
{"text":"This place is on point and has take out , Try the Thai beef salad or the Pad We now order online most of the time there average delivery time is 45min"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! I've tried almost every curry and love them all. Pumpkin is my favorite so far!"}
{"text":"OK Thai food . Has all of the usual Thai cuisine. Portions are kind of small, however the service is good and great atmosphere. You can find better thai food for cheaper in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Recommended by a local and rightfully so!  The Pad Thai was excellent.  You had an option for varying spice levels of 1-10.  I chose a 6 and it was perfect.  The spice and flavor was just perfect for a Squid Pad Thai.  YUM!  I loved the decor in this place.  The beautiful woodwork really gave this place an authentic feel.    The prices were also very good.  If I am in the mood for Thai in Vegas, I am definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Pricey for portion size...but extremely good food & service"}
{"text":"Family and I have been going to Pin Kaow for years, and it was always one of our go-to Thai restaurants in Las Vegas!  Was in Las Vegas last weekend for a friend's wedding, but I had time to go grab lunch with my parents at Pin Kaow in the Northwest part of town off of Lake Mead and Rainbow. We ordered from the lunch menu special. I got the red curry with chicken, and my parents got the pad thai with beef and the basil chicken. Each of the lunch specials is between $8-10, depending on the type of meat that you get with it. Beef and seafood are a little bit more expensive, while chicken and tofu fall on the cheaper end.  We also got a couple appetizers - the fish cake ($8.95), as well as the chicken satay ($8.95). My dad is a huge fan of both of these dishes, and we've been ordering them since I was a little kid. The fish cake is served with the thai sweet chili sauce with the cucumber, which you should put on top of your fish cake. So yummy! The chicken satay has the peanut sauce on the side, which we are also huge fans of. We also ordered a couple drinks, and with tax, lunch came out to about $50 for 3 people, so not too shabby at all.  The 800 other times we have been here, we have also ordered things like the beef rad nar, which has the thicker noodles with beef, broccoli and a gravy sauce. We also like the mint chicken, shrimp pad thai, and yellow curry. I always get my dishes with a spice level of 5 (on a 10 point scale) and it is just right.   Now if you ask me where it falls on the scale of best Thai restaurants, I have to give the nod to Lotus of Siam first (5-star), and then it's a close decision between Pin Kaow and Archi's. I may have to give the nod to Archi's here though, because their flavor and spices seem to be a little bit better than Pin Kaow. Nonetheless, it is still a great option. The service here is better than Archi's and other Thai restaurants, and the ambience is terrific. It's also conveniently located about 2 miles away from my parent's house and was always the most feasible option for us. Love the food, love the service, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow is pretty good Thai, if not one of the best on the north side of Vegas. It's pricey for what you get since portions are a little on the small side. For example the sea bass was $24 for a small piece of fish half the size of my hand.  I've always done take out but the restaurant is always busy and has a nice ambiance to it.   The bill came to $75 and we ordered the green papaya salad (legit but small), shrimp egg rolls (to die for), steamed sea bass, pad Thai with shrimp (very tasty), red curry with chicken (good flavor, dry overcooked chicken --precooked?).   My go to place on the north side. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!! I love coming here and the environment is friendly and calm. Perfect for date night. Big thumbs up!."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The menu is nice, simple and explains each item very well. The service was fast and they didn't miss a beat. We had several ppl working on our table and checking to make sure we were happy. I think the only problem we had was this extremely large and obnoxious loud family sitting behind us that had kids running around everywhere, but i dont think thats something that the establishment can do anything about... unless of course they create sections for \"family or non-family\".  LOL ... just a thought."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are arguably not equal to price.  I order Pad Thai anytime we have Thai. Period.  It's like the benchmark I use to compare one restaurant versus another.  The pad thai here has been consistently dry and just lacking.  Other dishes seem..meh.  Nothing horrible, but nothing to write home about either.  If you want solid, overpriced Thai food, this place is ok.  But if you want more bang for your buck and perhaps higher quality Thai food, there's lots of other options out there."}
{"text":"Service is always solid, food is good. Great lunch specials that are quick and not over priced."}
{"text":"OMG, if you'd told me I'd find excellent Thai food in a strip mall in the burbs of Vegas, I'd never believe you. But, it's true that only about 7 miles from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas strip exists a wonderful oasis of Thai food with quiet, casual ambiance.   I found myself really enjoying the peace and serenity of the Pin Kaow food. We had the Red Curry and the Pad Thai which come on a 1-10 scale v the traditional 1-4 or 1-5. I would recommend ordering higher than normal unless you want bland food. The Pad Thai is a toolkit v a completed dish. The nuts come on the side v being cooked into the dish. I found this odd. Understandably, people have food allergies, but usually the question can be asked if the server feels the diner may be unable to read. Whateva, I assembled the Pad Thai.   The curry was a winner, solid 5 star. I will absolutely be back to the wonderful little establishment. (Apparently, there are now 3!) BTW, get here early as it gets packed!"}
{"text":"Scrumptious Thai with a side of friendly service...right here in Henderson!   I have cravings for this food. Luckily, everyone I've introduced to Pin Kaow loves it and no one refuses my requests to return.   The decor and patio are well worth mentioning, but the food takes center stage here, baby.   I have not had a dish I wasn't blown away by. And they always manage to get the spice just right on the 1-10 scale.   I highly recommend the chicken and/or beef satay appetizer. I could eat this stuff all day long. The war wonton soup is spot on and comes with its own sterno on the table to keep it hot.  I've had the pad thai, the chili mint noodles (one of my faves) , and the pad see ew, which is stir fried rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and egg.   And they save the best for last...the sweet rice and mango is killer. I didn't think anyone could come close to Lotus of Siam on this one, but I think it's a tie!   There is no doubt as to why this restaurant is always busy."}
{"text":"I've never actually been inside, but my husband stops once in a while and brings home pickup.  I'm a Le Thai, Lotus and Nittaya's fan, but Pin Kaow does the trick in a pinch.  Their spice levels are kind of weak (however, I find that a 3 at one Thai restaurant is a 7 at another...for here, a 5 seems to be a 1), so if you want a kick go higher than you would elsewhere.  My favorite here is the Chili Mint Noodles and then sticky rice with coconut sauce for dessert.  I've tried several other menu options, which for the most part were all very flavorful but it was about texture for me.  Their dicing and chopping tends to be chunkier than other Thai spots I've hit and I'd prefer smaller bits, but that's just me.  Food is always fresh and hot when we pick it up, and on time."}
{"text":"We love Pad Thai. As we travel, it's always great to try new places with good Pad Thai This place is well run,  often busy and food comes out fast.  We ate here 3 times while we were in Vegas. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have to say, nor ally I don't like this kind of food however I really enjoyed it today. It was a nice restaurant and the staff was very friendly. They even brought out the mango sticky rice in the shape of a heart"}
{"text":"Being to this Thai restaurant twice and most say have not been disappointed.  The food is fresh and delicious.  Must say that I really love that the owner comes around and asks how everything is. The desserts are made there and they are family recipes."}
{"text":"My last few visits here justify the bump to 5 stars. Incredibly friendly and attentive service at extraordinarily affordable prices! Dining here takes me back to some of the places we visited in Bangkok. This place has yet to let me down!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry. This place everything taste homemade. I don't know a thing about this kinda food! !!! But I know this is the best I ever had ever! My partner and I shared Kung Pow chicken, Mongolian beef and pot stickers! My roommate had shrimp soup! He loved it too!!! Omgosh I'm so happy with service and quality food!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and his family; there was about 5 of us. We came in on a Wednesday around 6pm for dinner. Luckily there wasn't a wait, so we were seated right away. We actually had a problem with the first table we were seated at because the sun was shining through the blinds and burning our eyes, so we asked to move somewhere else. They moved us over to a better spot near the back that was half booth, half chairs.   Whenever I go out with my boyfriend and his family, we always get a lot of food, so I made sure to starve myself almost all day and by the time we got there I was ready to attack the food!   We ordered: Spring rolls Crab rangoon  Garlic beef - cabbage & broccoli with sauteed meat in garlic sauce Cashew nut chicken - sauteed cashew nut, dried chili w/ Thai chili sauce Chicken Panang curry - Thai special curry paste with coconut milk, green beans, basil leaves and lime leaves Shrimp Red Curry - red Thai special curry paste with coconut mik, bamboo shoot and Thai basil leaves Spare Ribs - Spare ribs marinated in Thai BBQ sauce Chicken pad Thai - rice noodles sauteed with bean sprout, egg and crushed peanuts in Thai special recipe Chow mein - stir fried soft yellow noodle with mixed vegetables And of course, about 3 large orders of white rice  Our appetizers came out quick. They were both okay, nothing special though. I mean, how can you really make spring rolls and crab rangoons sensory explosive anyhow?  All of our food started coming out and that's when I said to myself,  \"Oh yeah, now that's what I'm talkin' about.\" All the plates looked so good.I didn't even know where to start, so I just started with everything.   The garlic beef was delish. I love almost everything with garlic, so that wasn't a surprise. The cashew chicken was good. The chicken Panang curry was almost orgasmic. Almost is a good thing though, since I was with my boyfriend's family! The shrimp red curry was interesting. I guess I'm not much of a seafood curry fan, but at least I gave it a try. Mmmm, that spare ribs were scrumptious! So tender and juicy! The chicken pad Thai was pretty bomb. It had lots of crushed peanuts, which I liked.   The whole time we were eating, which was about an hour, the waitress made sure to keep our water glasses filled and would ask how we liked our food. We never had to ask for anything, except lemons to clean our hands at the end because we're Filipino.   All in all, I really enjoyed this place. I'm glad they opened a location on S. Rainbow, because that's a 2 minute drive from my house."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai food restaurant the service is great the people are friendly and the food is the best. It's really big servings so I would consider sharing depending on how much you eat. We always take home leftovers even when we share. The white rice is great and don't order too spicy cause a lower level is spicy"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai in TOWN.   I know this could be argued, but I will say this....its fresh, balanced, fast, cheap, and they have several locations.  They know what they are doing here, its a winning combination at Pin Kaow, lunch or dinner its packed and thats a sign of success.  10 star Thai!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out, seen it a few times in the shopping center. I was really surprised how different it looks inside. It looks like a really authentic Thai restaurant. We had the Tom Yum soup and the Mongolian beef. Both were delicious, didn't care for the bell peppers in the beef. They weren't really cooked, pretty hard. But all the food was great for the most part.   The service was ok, they just didn't come around to check up on us or give us plates and such. We had to like call them over. Oh I like how they give you oranges at the end. Overall this place was really good and had a cool vibe to it. Definitely would recommend it."}
{"text":"I went here with three friends and we got a table outside in their beautiful courtyard with overhead fans and greenery all around. We walked right in, no reservations required and all ordered a beer and appetizers.    Their sampler platter was awesome and the food came and was amazing. One of my friends got a special pineapple dish with special rice and it was incredible. I've never tasted anything so original at a Thai place.  I got a curry with tofu, don't remember the name but it begins with M (Mandasa or something?) and it was fantastic!  Fairly priced, great service (helpful but not pushy) and I'd definitely recommend it for good Thai."}
{"text":"If there were six stars I would give six.  Marvelous.  The cream cheese filled shrimp is a must have appetizer along with the beef jerky.  Love the hot pot soup to pour over the sticky rice.  The staff is always very friendly and the food comes out very quick."}
{"text":"The decor/atmosphere on the inside is 5*****  My Drunken noodle dish 3***  Service was good.   They had many specials that sounded very good. If I were to come back I would probably try one of the specials. I wouldn't go here for drunken noodles.   I ordered spice level 5 next time I would try an 8, and go from there.   Easy parking in strip mall. Nice restrooms."}
{"text":"Lunch was great!  We skipped the lunch soecials and ordered a la carte.  We had the crispy crab rolls which were good nothing amazing, pad prik king which was pretty tasty and pad kee maw (spicy chili mint noodles) which was pretty tasty as well.   If you like spicy get 7+ because we had 6 and it was pretty mild.  All in all a great Thai restaurant in vegas."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, I do love Thai food. The food here is good and usually fresh if you don't go for lunch. The reason I'm giving three stars is  on this trip  the booth they sat us at had a large tear in the seat, the table was all scratched up and the plates looked like the have been used a few too many times. Me and my wife ordered one app one salad and one main dish to share all the food was fine, but I was very disappointed that they charged me a extra $2 when I asked for more rice. To sum it all up the food is good the service is ok ( except for them trying to grab plates off the table before you are done!They do this every time ) but for having three locations and being voted best of Vegas a few times they could easily step up there game."}
{"text":"They should treat Asian customers the same way they treat their Non-Asian customers!  I honestly think these people are discriminative against Asian customers.  I have almost the exact same experience as Connie J did. I went here a few times and I loved it. The food was good and the setting was nice. Not until recently where I've seen a bit of change in the employees.   5 Customers came in after we sat down. 20 minutes later all 5 customers who came in after us got their food first, including the appetizers. We didn't even get our food yet. All 5 who came after us was of course, not Asian. They wanted to serve the non-asian customers better and give them great excellent customer service. But us asian don't deserve any, we don't write reviews. Okay..  Regarding my order, I ordered a Pumpkin Curry, it was on their special menu. I swear I almost walk out of there and left, it took so long to get our food while I'm looking around and they were more focused on serving all these other customers and not us. They didn't even come tell us if our food will take longer, they should have let us know. Well, when I got my food, the pumpkin was hard, raw as if it was just chopped and tossed into the curry. My cousin's pad thai was hard to bite into. I felt like they just forgot about us and whipped up our plate in 5 minutes, it was the most horrible thai food I've ever eaten at Pin Kaow. The WORST!   I paid them no tip, they didn't even bother coming to fill our water. One of the lady, supervisor or whatever pretends to be friendly with us after noticing how long we've waited for our food. I was in no mood to joke around, I was waiting so long and was angry that I was no longer hungry anymore. I was upset at how they service us.  I felt like I was in there for the longest ever in my life at a restaurant, horrible.  Food sucks, waiting time not worth it, customer service is horrible and if you're Asian, good luck!  I left without tipping them and drew a sad face on the receipt."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Amazing lunch specials. Pad Thai is very good always get extra spring rolls. Service is always right on time."}
{"text":"Seriously, some of the best Thai food I've ever had. Come for the lunch specials! It's like $7 and it comes with soup, a fried wonton, and a veggie egg roll. You can choose from like 8 different items I think.  For the lunch special, I had the pad thai and the boyfriend got red curry and we shared..The red curry was simply DIVINE. You can choose your spiciness level from 1 - 10. We got 8, which was perfect.   Another thing you need to try is the fried ice cream. Nothing like tempura ice cream..the outside fried part reminds me of a churro with a smoother texture.  Overall, my experience here was great. The servers are also dressed up in traditional Thai dresses and are very polite."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Thai food.  I just got back from 2 trips to Thailand and I have to say, Pin Kaow has better food than Thailand lol.  The service here is extremely friendly and usually very prompt.  I highly recommend chicken cashew or chick sattee."}
{"text":"Amazing Pad Woon Sen with chicken! It's my favorite! I usually have it delivered to work! Service is great:)"}
{"text":"So... this is a review for DINNER on a Tuesday evening.  Service: 4 stars We were greeted nicely and immediately upon entering... seated quickly. The waitress took our drink orders and had them brought out while we figured out what we wanted to eat. Food was delivered promptly and was served hot (but not burn your mouth hot). Water glasses were kept filled without us having to ask.  Menu: Good selection of curries, noodles, fried rice, salads and soups.  We started with the Tom Ka Kai (coconut chicken soup).... OMG!   This is freakin' good....5 stars.   The coconut milk makes this soup rich... so be prepared.  The lemongrass is a bit strong but it helps cut the coconut milk.  Big strips of chicken and the mushrooms were nice and succulent.  Then we had the Spicy Eggplant w/ chicken and Combo Fried Rice.    The Spicy Eggplant wasn't all that spicy since we asked for #2... which is really mild... but we weren't sure how \"spicy\" spicy was... so we erred on the side of caution and added our own chili garlic spice as necessary to heat things up.  Anyways.... the Eggplant... I'd give it a 4 star rating and would order it again.  It was very nicely prepared in a light, flavorful brown sauce. (It was served with Jasmine white rice which was 'ok'.)  The Combo  Fried... I'd give it a solid 3 stars.... better than plain fried rice but it didn't knock my socks off.  Will we be back again?  Yes."}
{"text":"I called and ordered pick up - beef pad thai with no peanuts, mild and a yellow curry, mild. They kept saying, 2?  spicy 2?   uhhhh, mild!  I would like it mild, please.  I get home and the pad thai is spicy!  It was NOT a 2!  or mild!  ugh It ruined the whole dish for me.  They also included the peanuts, which was in some foil but had spilled over.  So if I was deadly allergic to peanuts, I wouldn't have been able to eat the dish.  The yellow curry was flavorful, they use slice breast meat so the meat was overcooked and very dry.    NOT the best in town, in my book."}
{"text":"I just moved to Las Vegas with my girlfriend. We decided to get some takeout from Pin Kaow based on a glowing recommendation.  I regret that I cannot echo this recommendation. The woman who took our order looked annoyed at our very presence. I asked her a few friendly questions about takeout, delivery, and some menu options. She seemed exasperated and simultaneously bored. I didn't even know a person could experience that blend of emotions. Thank you, Pin Kaow, for a lesson in the breadth of the human experience.   I asked her how long delivery would take and she replied 2 hours. I wish that were an exaggeration. Needless to say, we ordered takeout instead and waited around for 20 minutes.   Here's what we ordered: - Fresh Spring Rolls. - Chicken Pad Thai, with a 7 on the spicy meter. - Pad Woon Sen, with a 5 on the spicy meter.  And here's what my takeout boxes contained: - Fried Egg Rolls (seriously...?) - Chicken Pad Thai, with a 1 on the spicy meter. - Pad Woon Sen, with a 3 on the spicy meter.  The food was decent but unimpressive, especially for the price ($29 after tip). The egg rolls were a little rubbery, like they came out of a microwave... and I didn't even ORDER egg rolls.  The pad thai was yummy, but when you're really hungry, everything tastes good. It lacked a certain richness of flavor I have come to expect from pad thai dishes.   My girlfriend's pad woon sen was good. No qualms there, aside from the spicyness not being correct. I would have given them a free pass on this since there is a degree of subjectivity, but it wasn't even close.  I read on the menu that there are three different Pin Kaow locations. I am willing to give the other locations a chance, but I will not be visiting this specific Pin Kaow again."}
{"text":"Impolite, horrible customer service. Never asked us for refills,  never came to check on us, and never checked on our food until we asked. The waitress shrugged and rolled her eyes when we asked how much longer for the food. We also had to pay before we even recieved our meal????? It took nearly an hour for our food to come out. It doesn't take that long for good Thai food. We had an hour long lunch and it was wasted."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place for Thai...I love, love my Thai Food! Restaurant was really nice....Loved the atmosphere...Great Customer Service....but to my taste, half of what we ordered jus didn't have that full flavor of Thai food...We (party of 4) ordered alot cause I wanted to taste pretty much a little of everything.  The Thai Beef Salad jus didn't have that flavorful taste (I should have got the Papaya Salad instead, I think maybe that would have been way better)....Yellow Curry w/Chicken was ok & Red Curry w/Shrimp was really good...Fried Rice w/Chicken was Amazingly Great...Tom Yum Koong Hot Pot was way too bland...My Husband loved the Pad Thai w/Pork...& Thai BBQ Chicken was ok, Sweet & Sour Pork was ok...the appetizer #2 was delicious, Rice Soup didn't like.  I would go back for maybe a quick lunch for the Green Curry & Try there Papaya Salad.  I was a bit disappointed...but now I know I won't go there forking up $159 for dinner again."}
{"text":"I was tired and not very hungry tonight so I stopped in for a bowl of soup. The food was excellent but I feel like I have been cheated. The menu clearly said the soup was $7.95 for a bowl with a choice of chicken or shrimp. It also said that the hotpot (a larger bowl) was $12.95 with chicken or shrimp but shrimp was $2 more. The waiter insisted that the extra $2 applied to the bowl as well and charged me $9.95.  There wasn't anything really special about the soup (even though it was well-made) and certainly the portion was not large enough to be worth $10.   The food was good if you feel like paying extra."}
{"text":"We love this Thai restaurant. It is nearby and we often get take out. Dumplings are yummy and my favorite dish is pad see ew. Number 3 spicy is perfect if you don't like spicy but want the flavor benefits."}
{"text":"Pin-Kaow, you've improved, and I'm so happy that you have.    This Thai place is good eats, for sure!  They have wonderful fusion dishes and great curry.  I really loved their spring rolls, as they lack the oil that usually sticks to them, and their chow mein was delish!  You have to give these guys a try if you haven't already.    Hurry for some Curry at Pin-Kaow Now!"}
{"text":"I had not been to Pin Kaow is some time but I've been going to this location for years. I have to say the food is still great but the portions are way smaller (pick up order) That's the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"From the the outside, it looks kinda dumpy.  The inside isn't bad though!  Their food and prices are good.  Crab Rangoons are my favorite!  They're better than anywhere else.  Pad Thai is good also.  I don't think I've had anything from here I didn't like."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing. I bring my 2 year old son, the entire staff is kind to me and him and patient with him and also volunteered to stand with him at the fish tank while I ate my meal! I was sitting close of course but they are just that kind that they entertained him so I could finish eating. (Yes, it was a slow lunch/ day shift I don't expect child care during busy times but I really appreciated the gesture!)I also love the food it's constant and tasty. The papaya salad is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week. One of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas! The food and service are always great."}
{"text":"Five friends and I had lunch here yesterday after not having been here for a couple of years. The food was exceptional and everyone loved it.  I had the lunch special, red curry pork with chicken rice soup of the day, an egg roll and fried wonton. It was absolutely delicious and will definitely order this again even as a carry out. I ordered it at a 4  level of spiciness and it was a little bit spicier than I am used to even though I live on spicy food, so be very careful when ordering.  One diner said it was the best Pad Thai she had ever eaten, and everyone else raved about their lunches. Service of course is outstanding as it always has been. A definite five stars to Pin Kaow."}
{"text":"This is ONE OF THE BEST THAI RESTAURANTS IN VEGAS!  Because me and my cousin haven't came here for a while, we decided to come back to this Thai restaurant.  We ordered: - The Chicken Pad Thai - The Catfish Delight - The Green Chicken Curry - The Shrimp Pad See Eu - The Spicy Chicken Basil  The BEST part is that they serve the food QUICK! We were only here only 40 minutes waiting, eating, and done. We had so much food left over for the next meal.  The staff here are good and friendly. I RECOMMEND coming here to eat some good well cooked Thai cusine."}
{"text":"pin kaow has yet to win over my heart. Dan T. and I usually go to the one on rainbow by our house, but this day we were doing a little shopping over at nordstroms rack and needed some energy. while both craving thai this place was near and since we have been to number 2 we knew it was safe. It was during lunch time, but we didn't order from the lunch menu. I was surprised to see that pad see ew didn't make the lunch menu cut. That is my favorite and usually my safe go-to dish. i almost always see it on the lunch menu. my boyfriend ordered his usual chicken pad thai spice set at 6. we waited for 10 maybe 15 minutes and it came out. now i will tell you why pin kaow has yet to win my heart. it never fails that when i order my safe go-to dish pin kaow is selfish with the broccoli and that is my favorite part. their beef is good and their sauce is alright. the noodles thick and melting in my mouth, but for some reason the broccoli is a let down. yes, maybe i should start picking a new dish, but why when everywhere else is not stingy? i had some thai iced tea and it was just way too sweet for my liking. it is not my favorite thai place in las vegas, but it is not the worst either. the chicken pad thai is alright and i do enjoy having thai leftovers for my late night cravings and pin kaow leftovers hold up pretty well in the fridge. i say don't make the crosstown drive, but if you are nearby and craving thai this place is okay. just don't expect to be wow'd."}
{"text":"great Thai food closest to the north west part of town. if you like spicy Thai you'll need to add it yourself cause a 10 on the spicy scale is like a 2 anywhere else. their Tum Yum soup is always great, their Pad Thai is awesome and Shrimp asparagus is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Nothing Special. We had there crunchy crab rolls, they were alright but definitely over priced. I've been coming here for years...but lately it's been a disappointment. It's not bad but it's not great either."}
{"text":"Definitely a great Thai place, and the location is great!    First, the decor.  The outside is somewhat unassuming, but once you enter the doors, you'll be surprised.  They have live Phalaenopsis orchids everywhere, and there are what appear to be hand-carved wood decorations everywhere.  Every inch of the interior is well-designed and gives the feeling of an exotic destination.  Beautiful touches everywhere.  If it's a nice enough day, go outside to eat.  The patio area is beautiful, and there's even a fountain just outside the doors.  It's completely shaded, the fresh air feels good, and again, no special touches were spared.    Service-wise, they're also good.  The servers (should I say this?) are all very attractive men and women, and they'll smile as you enter, greet you in Thai, and are wearing traditional Thai dress (I assume.  I know next to nothing about Thai culture aside from food).  I've been here twice, and the service has been consistent each time.  Lunch specials are a bargain, depending on what you get, but the main dishes aren't much more if you don't like the choices.    Preparation of the food was not particularly fast, but not slow, either.  The dishes are nice, the presentation is also good.  The food was all flavorful.  I recommend the currys.  All three that I've tried there so far are just what you'd expect, rich and delicious.  Their pad see ew was to die for, and they used real Chinese broccoli instead of the regular kind.  And they refill your hot tea like they were obsessed.  Finally, their Thai tea was really good, and the darkest Thai tea I've ever had.    Very good, over all.  Oh, and they had a bar and stuff, too, but I don't drink, so I can't rate that for you.  Highly recommended, especially eating outside on a warm, windless night."}
{"text":"Excellent yellow curry and I really enjoyed the beef salad. I was very disappointed with the Tom yum soup. Zero flavor!  It's my fave Thai soup, so I definitely won't return.  Customer service was good. Clean restaurant. Prices average."}
{"text":"My mother and I ate here last Sunday afternoon...Excellent panang curry & pad thai! It was not greasy at all, had an excellent flavor! I ordered spice level 7 and loved it! I like it spicy!  The atmosphere was also very nice!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim since it was convenient at the time.  Ended up being a great choice.  The service was excellent.  The food was wonderful.  Great fried rice and curry.  I am used to beef salad being served with lettuce type greens, but the beef salad here was served with shredded cabbage.  To my surprise, it worked!  What a great meal!"}
{"text":"This is my first time going to an actual Thai Restaurant, in which, I find this to be an interesting place. But there are some things that kind of stuck out, and kind of got to me.   A friend of my wife's invited us and a few of her co workers to Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant on the corner of Rainbow and Lake Mead. It was very easy to find off 95. Its about a 10-15 minute drive from the Las Vegas Strip.   The location of the restaurant, is on the corner of lake mead and rainbow, which was an easy access to get in, but from the looks of it, its kind of hard to get out. Since its right next to the stop light and, for those who want to get on Rainbow, its kind of busy intersection, not unless you get on lake mead, going the opposite way to make a u-turn some where later and get on Rainbow.   The set up of the restaurant is nice, but it could probably be more spacious if they use a little bit less tables to move around. Mainly, i keep tapping the other table with my leg or bottom and saying excuse me a lot cause the tables are so close together, and I'm not really that big.   The staff, was very pleasant, very well dressed in their Thai uniform and made sure that we were happy with our stay. Knowing that it is lunch time, I'm sure it was kind of busy for them to get out orders. So I probably wouldn't hold that against them, knowing its during the busy hours. They were fully staff to make sure everyone is helped and that they got to us as soon as they can. I would probably say 5-10 minutes would be a decent time to be waiting during busy hours. They seem to make it in between those times to meet my needs.   The food itself was unique. But I have to say, its been a while since I had spicy food, so it didn't really set well with me. My wife ordered some chicken entree and shared it with her. We thought it would be a big serving, but it was an average serving for one person. But over all it was good to have something different. I did love their fried shrimp appetizer that had cream cheese in them and of course the egg rolls were great.  I did love the dessert of, Fried Banana and Coconut Ice Cream, it did make me love the place even more.    Over all, I would probably say, this was a decent place to have lunch. If your into spicy food and something unique, then its a must go place to eat. The appetizers are great, as well as dessert.  But I would suggest to go during the slow hours, cause getting out and trying to get back onto 95 or Rainbow. it's better to find an alternate route, or wait till some one is nice enough to let you into traffic. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have guessed there was good Thai food in Las Vegas.  Before I go into that, the only dish I was disappointed in was their phad see ew.  I thought the dish was bland and I probably was not used to ordering this with chicken.  I have only had this with beef.  Ok but besides that, their curry is super delicious.  That was hands down everyone's favorite dish.  Their barbecue chicken was perfection as well, with a nice crisp golden skin and tender juicy meat.    They serve a decent phad thai as well."}
{"text":"I love this place and it's kind of close to my house so it's even better, this is my staple thai place.  The best deal in vegas for lunch is here, mon-fri 6.99 lunch special.  You get a fried wonton, spring roll and a cup of the soup of the day plus one of like 10 entree choices.  Everything here is delicious and fresh and the people are extremely friendly like most thai joints and thats refreshing compared to the usual crap service you get at most chinese restaurants.  Their pad thai and curries are especially delicious."}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Anhdao and I am a Thai food-addict.  The habit started nine years ago, when I lived in Los Angeles and a drive to Thai town was only 10 minutes.  I cannot go more than a couple of days without getting Thai.  Any longer than that and symptoms such as sleeplessness, lack in work diligence, and even unnecessary irritation will begin.  Luckily for this addict, there is a very reliable Thai establishment less than 2 miles from my house.  Pin Kaow 3 has very consistent food and beautiful decor, which is why I am not surprised to find that it is already a chain in Las Vegas, with three locations to boast, accessible to all directions of the valley and all Thai food-seekers of any Thai-food level of addiction.    The menu has a wide variety for a restaurant that aims to serve the undiscriminating masses rather than the select few.  This range of choices comes at a sacrifice in the quality of the food (don't attempt their Larb salad unless you have plenty of water on hand for the dryness).  However, it's a perfect place to take the rawest of Thai food neophytes who are not looking for tongues on fire and dishes whose names do not yet have English translations.  My Pin Kaow favorite is definitely the Crab Fried Rice, it is the exact middle ground of authenticity and popularity at the restaurant.  They give you a fair amount of real crab, the rice is moist, not overly greasy, and there is a good portion.  They also do curries very well.  I recommend the Salmon Green Curry or the Pork Panang Curry.  I find these curries at spicy level 2 will satisfy most my non-Thai friends who are looking for a kick without a stomach ache.    The food here really equates three stars for me.  But the extra star comes from the pleasant ambience (there is no unflattering flourescent light), the beautiful serveware (blue & white china even just for steamed rice), and the attentive service (yes, I would love my leftovers boxed, please)."}
{"text":"Major decline in quality from my last visit. Ordered the $15 pineapple fried rice - it had absolutely NO pineapple in it, there were several pieces of bone, a hair connecting 3 pieces of rice, and the tails were left on the 2 shrimps.  I could barely take 2 bites without having to stop to fish some sort of foreign object out of my mouth! Yuk!"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch. The service is usually pretty fast so you can get in and out during a lunch break. Everyone is so friendly. I'm obsessed with the spicy basil lunch special. Don't be deceived by the small serving plates, this is a gigantic lunch. I always have to take half to go. Lunch specials come with soup to start (usually some sort of chicken or tofu soup), egg roll or salad, and some other fried pocket thing that I can't identify but tastes good.   I must admit that I do wish that they took my requests for a spicy level 10 seriously. It's like they just roll their eyes and give me a 5. If you ask for the spice rack though you can add extra spice as you please. You know what makes up for this? Extra cold beers. They serve the beers with a frozen mug. I've even had a server suggest I get two small beers instead of one large one so I can keep them as cold as possible. How considerate! Pin Kaow definitely does it right when it comes to running an efficient restaurant with great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Love the looks, the staff and the food. Don't need to add a lot the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to restaurants.  We dine here at least once a week, usually for lunch, and the food and the service is always fabulous. We had some friends with us for dinner about 2 weeks ago.  As my boyfriend was paying the bill, he dropped a 100.00 chip from a local casino.  When we went to dinner there last night, they had kept the chip until we came back and our server recognized us.  Things like this don't happen in this day and age.  How refreshing! Needless to say, our meal was terrific and we will be back ASAP. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and I would refer family and friends!  Best Thai food in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Good stuff, I haven't had anything from here that isn't excellent, only downside is it's a bit pricey! Wish they would drop their prices by couple bucks"}
{"text":"After hearing such great things from so many people about Pin Kaow, I was really excited to try it! We walked in and were impressed by the atmosphere - on the outside it looks like a hole in the wall, but it's decorated beautifully and looks very modern inside. Unfortunately, the food is just not up to par and I was very disappointed.  I ordered chicken pad thai at a 6, my usual order. It came and was definitely not a 6 - tasted more like a 3 or 4. It was so dry...didn't taste fresh to me and I kind of think it was reheated- it came out so quickly, less than 10 minutes after we ordered, and the restaurant was fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon. There was hardly any chicken in it, and the chicken that was in there was all gristle! It was DISGUSTING. I ate maybe 1/4 of my dish and ended up spitting out most of the chicken, which is not really my favorite thing to be seen doing in a restaurant.   Service was good, though nobody questioned why my meal was practically untouched. They bring out oranges when you're finished which is a lovely gesture, but I can't see myself returning. I really hope to find a better Thai place!"}
{"text":"Love me some Thai especially when the service is exceptional and the food exceedingly tasty! #foodie #thaifood"}
{"text":"My friend and I were both craving Thai food so we ended up here! Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant was recognized as the best Thai restaurant in Vegas in 2014 and I can see why! DELICIOUS!! I had the fried rice and my friend had the pad Thai. Great service and they give you orange slices with your check, so cute! Definitely my new Thai spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time 1/10/17 for dinner.  The service was phenomenal and the food was delicious!  We had the Thai iced tea, spring rolls, hell curry, and cashew tofu. All delicious! Great atmosphere - pretty decor and live music. The prices were also very reasonable.  Would like to return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I'm not giving five stars because I haven't been here enough.  However, the few times I've been here I've gotten the curry and it's been excellent each time.  I prefer the green curry spicy level #7."}
{"text":"Always love some Thai food when I am on the road, and my go to Thai dishes are always the Tom Yum soup with the Panang Curry chicken main dish.  Found this restaurant on Yelp and it was close to the hotel so I decided to give it a try.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the inside is nicely decorated and the staff was very authentic and attentive.  The wait was not very long at all, and the food was delicious.  The Tom Yum soup was BURSTING with flavor, amazing........  Probably the best I have ever had.. The Panang Curry was good, but the chicken tasted like it may have been a little on the undercooked side.  I really enjoyed having dinner here and I will be back when in town."}
{"text":"This was my third choice after Lotus had an hour wait and Chada is closed for the week.   I ordered the vegetable panang curry and chicken mint noodles. I asked the waitress how much it would be to substitute the brown rice for the white rice that comes with the panang curry and she said it was the same price as the side order. This made no sense so I asked the \"manager\" about the policy and all she said was yes brown rice 3 dollars. If you are a manager of a establishment where your customers are primarily American you need to know how to communicate in English. After having my first bite of the panang curry I could tell Pin Kaow serves Americanized Thai food. I should have known when I walked in and did not see once person of Asian decent. Back to the panang curry; it tasted like I was having straight up butter with minimal spice on top of my rice. The mint noodles tasted good but also overly sweet to appeal to the American customer. The noodles sat on a bed of wilted romaine lettuce which made the dish unappealing. The only plus is that they serve brown rice but I will not be back because the manager cannot explain the policies and the food is one dimensional and completely Americanized."}
{"text":"Empty outdoor patio but would not allow dogs. Go right next door to beach hut deli with same outdoor patio that allows dogs."}
{"text":"Favorite thai place! I'm obsessed with the crab rangoon and yellow curry!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food. I travel a half hour out of my way to get to this place. The pineapple fried rice is bomb-diggity, I get it every time. Great service and fair prices. Believe it or not, the Thai chicken wings are phenomenal. Keep up the delicious work."}
{"text":"Bomb.com alwayssss! Crave their food all the time and go there frequently. Beautiful, enjoyable atmosphere as well. Super friendly employees! One of ny favorite restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was my first stop upon landing in Vegas and I must say I think I hit the jackpot!  I enjoy Thai food and when at home I have my usual spots that I frequent when I need a Thai fix.  Visiting las Vegas always excites me not fprthe shows or the casinos or the nightlife mostly because of the diverse and unique dining experiences.  This was my first visit and It will not be my last.  Upon entry my eyes were treated to a visual feast of traditional Thai artwork and decor great attention was paid to detail and it showed throughout the dining room. The server was extremely friendly and gracious.  I ordered my go-to dish of yellow curry with chicken and rice. The flavors in this dish were all beautifully represented from the tender juicy white meat to the Milky spicy curry even the potatoes were perfectly prepared and melted in my mouth. I ordered a signature cocktail, the PP tea the cocktail was nothing special and frankly light on the liquor and heavy on the mixers. The bar took about 25min to prepare our drink, we were almost done with our meal when the drinks arrived. Overall I enjoyed the food and the ambiance I will return to try other dishes on the menu in the near future."}
{"text":"Exceptional service but don't order the garlic beef.  I was with a very large group and a lot of the dishes looked great"}
{"text":"The place is really good but I find it a bit pricy compared to some other Thai places. The food options are good and my personal favorite is the Hell Curry. If you like spicy food like me this is the one to get. You can get it with any kind of meat you want."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years! The food is amazing! My whole family enjoys this place, my mother is a very healthy and picky eater.. the red curry is her favorite! Can't go wrong with the combination fried rice either !"}
{"text":"I have been going to Pin Kaow for many years and they always have impeccable service and food. The egg rolls are awesome, the satay with peanut butter sauce will make your eyes roll back in your head and the cucumber salad is perfect. Stand outs for main courses are the garlic pork{yummy} and the chicken masaman. You can choose how spicy you want the food from a \" wimpy\" 1 to \"put hair on your chest \"10. For all you ladies you may not want to pick 10, Ha Ha. I only have one small complaint and that's the iced tea. They serve Nestea.  Very nasty tea!!"}
{"text":"Had this place for a late lunch with the girls. I would have to say it is pretty good but I have had much better for a lower price. I got a pad Thai which is my favorite noodle dish for any Thai place. I got a level 7 for spice and it was not at all spicy... more sweet than spice. 12.95 for a bowl of rice size amount.  Service was good the waitress greeted us quickly and got us out of there quickly since we were kind of on a time crunch as well. Friends got a pumpkin curry special and another kind of curry which I forgot what kind. I just expect SPICY from a Thai restaurant but it seems adjusted here for the Americanized mouths ahahha less spice."}
{"text":"Love this place. The duck pad Thai is the hot hot fire and so is the green curry. Super cute inside as well. Four stars because it is a little overpriced for the location and type of Thai food being served. But if you are feeling like treating yourself this is the place."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, with a nice atmosphere. This place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Great Thai! Best in town! I love this place and my wife had it for the first time tonight, and she loved it too! We had the potstickers and chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce for our starters. Both were good, but the satay stole the show! Pin kaow marinades their chicken in coconut milk before grilling it which makes it tender and delicious. The peanut sauce is sweet and goes perfect with the savory chicken. Overall, a huge hit. For our main course we had the yellow curry and chili mint noodles. Both were great and the curry is my favorite thing on the menu. The yellow curry is creamy and sweet and spivey. The only negative the the meal was the tomatoes in the chili mint noodles. I don't think they belong in Thai food and I always pick them out; tonight was no different. Overall, it was a great night, great food and great company!  Ps. Service was fast and perfect!"}
{"text":"Omg. Best food. We eat there all the time.  Love the masaman dish with steamed tofu.  Also great is pad Thai and yummy egg rolls."}
{"text":"The plain strip mall look from the outside, doesn't do justice to the decor on the inside! I walked into this place on a whim and was pleasantly surprised by the themed decor and warmth. I came here for lunch on a Saturday and the place wasn't very busy at 1:45PM.  The waitstaff was attentive and the service was friendly.  I had the Larb, \"Choice of ground beef, chicken, or pork with red and green onion, cilantro, rice powder. Seasoned with chili pepper and lime sauce,\" and I requested it to be spicy. (8 on a scale of 1 to 10).  My friend had the chicken pad thai. She went mild on the spices.  We enjoyed both dishes though my eyes were a bit teary from the spice. It was good!  It's always nice to stumble onto a restaurant without friends telling you about it. Both of us agreed we'd come back again.  Downside.... about 2 hours later I couldn't drink enough water. I thik there was a LOT of salt in that Larb!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! Thai ribs were so delicious better than Famous Daves across the street. The atmosphere is so homely and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but I feel like it's going downhill. Maybe the last few times I've come have been bad days who knows. But I swear the food doesn't taste as good it's lost a lot of its flavor and on top of that the appetizers came out like warm instead of hot.  The service isn't as good as it used to be either, especially the host. When we walked in we weren't greeted, when we were sat it took a while for them to take our drink order, all while only having 4 other customers in the entire restaurant! On the way out no thank you or good bye either. I  won't be back again there are too many Thai restaurants to try for me to waste my time with this less than average joint."}
{"text":"The food is reasonably priced and the atmosphere amazing. It felt like I was transported to another country. The host was very engaging and welcoming. The host announced a special performance for the guest by one of their dancers who danced within view of our table.  The food was tasty and affordable. The medium spice pad thai noodles was more like a mild to me. I could've went to a 5 or 6 in the 1-10 heat scale. Other than that, I really enjoyed and would come again."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good thai food. Been here a few times. We ordered pad thai, mongolian beef, and pad see eww. The place is nicely decorated, and the waitress/waiter are friendly. First time, our pineapple fried rice took forever to come out. I think they forgot our orders.  But the last two times, the food came out in good time."}
{"text":"My friend introduced this to me a few months ago and I have to say I thought it was great. It has a great atomsphere. I love the fresh flowers and the fish tank. There is a feeling of peace and calmness about the place. And the food is great!!! I love all the soups and curry. It really works well for my husband since he is not into hot food he can choose the lowest fire level.  I'm a return visitor and would recommend this to anyone who likes a treat and without the chaos of a Strip restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Pad Thai, their spicy scale is 1-10, 7+ being very spicy. I won't be looking for another Thai restaurant any time soon. I would give 5 stars if the serving sizes were a bit larger."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. We've been eating here for years. Nice hostess and servers. Last week the manager played happy birthday on his guitar at another table. Everyone thought he was a kick. I often recommend Pin Kaow to friends."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow is my favorite Thai restaurant in town!!! Everything I've had there has been absolutely delicious. The service is always really good as well. The GM Toy is awesome. He greets everybody with a big smile and has a hilarious personality. This place is great for birthdays. You came out with a guitar and sang happy birthday with some staff and then played Viva Las Vegas for the birthday boy.  All of the staff was really attentive and we were check on regularly. I had the yellow curry in this visit and was not disappointed. We had the mango sticky rice for dessert and that was awesome as well. I love this place and will definitely be back. HIGHLY RECOMMEND PIN KAOW!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Pin Kaow I'm always happy when I walk away. Went there and we were seated right away. The service is awesome and your regularly checked on. I have been to both locations in Vegas and received good service at each. We had the Thai Spicy Chicken Salad, Panang Curry & Pas See Ew with all 7/10 spicy level. They all tasted amazing but the spice level was very different for each. They give reasonable portions for a good price. Two entrees with a appetizer is more then plenty for two people so be ready to take some home. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday for the first time in ages, and I'm not sure why we stopped coming here over the years. The food was as good as I remembered it to be, and I think it's the best, authentic Thai food I've had so far in Vegas (I have yet to try Lotus of Siam).   The restaurant is kind of dim due to their dark wooden walls, but they do use a lot of bright lighting to compensate. We ordered the ginger dish with scallops (spicy level 6), chicken with spicy basil (spicy level 3), and pad Thai (spicy level 3) lunch specials. The lunch specials include soup and your choice of salad or an egg roll plus a fried wonton. All the dishes were really good, and the portions were bigger than I expected. I wish we upped the spicy levels on the dishes however, as even the 6 wasn't that spicy.   Food came out really slow. It took over 15 minutes to get our soup, and another 20 minutes to get our entrees. Server never informed us that the food would take awhile, and it wasn't even that busy. I don't mind if the food takes awhile as long as we're informed (kitchen is slammed or the restaurant is short-staffed) so minus a star for being left hanging.   Because the food is really good and the prices/portions are reasonable, I'll be back if I'm ever in the mood for Thai food."}
{"text":"I've been to pin kaow before and usually I love their pad thai! It's very sweet and flavorful, at least it was. I ordered the beef pad thai and chicken larb and was greatly disappointed by both. The larb lacked the flavorful kick that I love and the pad thai wasn't nearly as sweet as I remembered. Overall, my meal was very bland and disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I love certain Thai dishes like Pad Thai noodles and curry dishes.  I know those are not very adventurous and have been \"Americanized\" in most Thai restaurants.  But, it's what I like and always order...   I've never had a bad meal at Pin Kaow and usually eat at least once a month.   I like the location N. Rainbow the best - the food just seems a little better than the one on S. Rainbow.   It does get busy at lunch time and I've had times where there was no seating available.   Maybe that's a testament to how good the food is.    The staff is always friendly and service is generally very good.  One tip - try the Thai tea.   I'd never had it before and ordered on the recommendation of the server.   It's fantastic but I think probably loaded with sugar."}
{"text":"The food here is great, the duck rice and the chicken pad Thai is great. The food comes very fast, the staff is very friendly. My family and I come here at least 4 times a month and every time we have- it has been great. Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Tonight I give them 5 stars.    I walked in and the staff noticed that I wasn't feeling so well.  They rushed to clean off a table to seat us.  They suggested having soup.  Offered tea or hot water since they heard that I was congested.  The place was packed (8pm on a Friday night), but I still felt like everyone was attentive.  Not just to our table, but to everyone else.  The courses were brought out in good time frames as we never had a time where we were waiting.  We had Pad See Ew, Crab Rangoons, and Tom Yung Kung soup. We enjoyed each dish.  Would definitely come back.  :-)"}
{"text":"My sister recommended this restaurant saying it's as \"real\" as you can get. So we had dinner there. Parking outside is packed always took us about 15 mins to find a spot (it's in a new center). The outside of the restaurant is very cute, has string lights all outside and when you go inside it is so adorable. Dim lighting and private seating perfect for a date or any occasion. The hostess seated us right away and grab us or drinks. It was happy hour and the food on there was 3.99 so we had crispy green beans, crab rangoons, chicken wings. All amazing, crab rangoons we're very \"cream cheesy\" (that's how I like them) so just beware. Green beans were super yummy. One of the best I've ever had! And the chicken wings were really good too. For the main course we have the yellow curry and we shared it between 2 people and their portions are pretty big! It was so good and so creamy also probably the best curry I've had too! The best part? For 2 people our bill was 25.00 including drinks on the happy hour menu. I mean amazing food and awesome prices at happy hour (5-7)"}
{"text":"Disappointing. The restaurant is beautiful, but the waitress refused to allow me to order a curry with coconut milk, saying I would not like it. I finally order The Devil Curry sans coconut milk. I should have realized that it was only going to get worse from here. The so called curry was basically a serving dish of colored water with chicken and vegetables. I did not taste any spice at all, despite the fact that I ordered it Spicy 8 out of 10. It was so bland that I could only eat a few bites. I was tempted to get up and walk out without paying it was so bad. Staff couldn't care less that a customer immediately asked for a check after taking a few bites."}
{"text":"My job and I decided to place a large order before they opened because I didn't want them to be slammed during their lunch time. And the lady who answered the phone was kind enough to place my order. Delivery was quick, only complaint I have is that I ordered a level 7 spicy pad Thai and it honestly tasted like a 2. All of my coworkers ordered a certain level of spice and none of them met the standard. It was very good tho. Just wish it could've been spicier!"}
{"text":"Love this place. From the decor to the management to the food. There is no downside to this place. The Spicy Basil, Green Curry and everything else I have tried on this menu is solid They have homemade ice cream that is AMAZING. Looking forward to mango season so I can taste that ice cream as well.  A family favorite."}
{"text":"Best Thai food that I have eaten in a while, the service is very friendly and always thinking about their customers."}
{"text":"looooooove! First off, their staff is super attentive and friendly.  You can always come for a quick bite date night. They have a variety of things, all which are great! My fave three things are: Tum Yum Koong, Thai chicken salad, masaman chicken and spicy basil chicken! Yumm!!"}
{"text":"There are only a few real Thai places that have that zing flavor you are looking for. Pin kaow is by far one of the best you can count on that has exactly that and more. I always order the beef jerky, pad Thai,spring rolls and fried rice. You can never go wrong with any of those orders..fast service, friendly staff..and they are open on sundays! Which most Thai places are not. Two thumbs up from this lady!"}
{"text":"Food was nice!   Service was a little too much, the waiters keep standing around you to reach out asap if you need anything (which in my case is not preferred).   But the flavors were good and a little pricy."}
{"text":"Out and about trying new things, though we give Thai a try.. Of course went to our awesome guide on Yelp! Brought us to this little thai restaurant shop away from the strip... We were immediately seated and was ask for appetizer and drinks.. The service was very fast... We took a glance and decided on food.. Papaya salad was ordered and so was Pad Thai... As a person who often look for good Thai i asked for the waitress recommendation-- Pad See ew Chicken... Which is chinese style fat rice noodle(chow fun style) with chicken, and thai spicing.. Very good and strong flavoring... Really loved it, their papaya salad is different from what im used to due to the fact the pepper were all green and wasnt mixed well into the salad... Overall id you're looking for a quick Thai fix... This is the place to be :D"}
{"text":"Spicy Thai Chicken Salad, Chili Mint Noodle, and Thai Ice Tea.....awesome! Clean and pleasurable environment.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty poor showing for Thai food.  With so many options in the city for quick, take-out Thai, every dish needs to be A-game.  0 for 2 on my night out.  The papaya salad had soggy tomatoes and literally a 1 on the 10 spicy scale, although I asked for highest level.  Side of fried tofu was fine but tasted of nothing.  And with no spice on the papaya salad dressing, there was nothing to soak the tofu.  The red curry was more of a soup with some chili oil added in for spice.  No coconut whatsoever, making it extremely un-Thai.  Takeout service took 30 minutes although 20 was the estimation, so I was left sitting there.  Then, my food sat waiting for another 5 minutes as the lady stayed on the phone instead of taking a brief hold to hand me my food.  Nothing noteworthy of the dining experience.  Catering to the most bland of Thai food with all easy and mild flavoring, nothing to overpower.  $25 not well spent."}
{"text":"This was my second new Thai Food discovery in recent weeks. On the way home from an event at the Suncoast, the Mrs. and I knew we were going to stop for dinner, but what would we have? She suggested Thai food, but her favorite spot was too far in the other direction. We turned to Yelp and found Pin Kaow conveniently located just off the 95. Based soley on appearance from the outside, I was expecting to stand in line, order at the counter, take a number and wait. Boy was I wrong. This is a full blown, sit down and be waited on restaurant. We were seated immediately and the service was great. The Crab Rangoon appetizer was the best I've had and the sweet and sour pork was like none I had never seen. It was not breaded, rather pieces of tender pork in a spicy sweet and sour sauce, complimented with peppers, onions and carrots. I sampled the Mrs.' Panang and thought it was great. I have nothing to compare it to, as this was my first experience with Panang. The berry sangria was a nice addition to the meal. The wood decor gave a nice elegant feeling in somewhat of a casual atmosphere. A solid four star experience without breaking the bank. A great place for a date night dinner, or a casual meal with friends."}
{"text":"Love the soup, the atmosphere, and the Thai tea."}
{"text":"Service is awesome.  Was a previous favorite. Food used to be spectacular, now just so so. Prices have double, portions smaller. Unfortunately, will have to find new gem. :("}
{"text":"We gave Pin Kaow another shot, mainly due to Lotus of Siam being closed for lunch on the weekends. Disappointing yet again, and this may very well have been the last time we went here. We had the Tom Yum Koong hotpot, which was fine except for the shrimp being terribly overcooked. We had two of the \"Chef's Specialities\", The Shrimp & Silver Noodles Claypot and the \"Gulf of Thailand\" seafood mix. The noodles were all caked together into a solid mess, the shrimp were just as overcooked as in the hotpot, and the bacon on the bottom consisted of globs of fat and bits of meat hard a shoe leather. The whole dish was very greasy.  The \"Gulf of Thailand\" must have recently suffered a massive oil spill, because the dish was greasy beyond belief. Shrimp, you guessed it, terrible overcooked. Are they using pre-cooked shrimp here and toss them into the dishes to reheat them ? The scallops were mushy and fishy.  Soup, two entrees, tea came out to over 50 bucks. Ridiculous, given the food \"quality\". I can't for the life of me understand why readers vote this place over Lotus of Siam for \"Best of Las Vegas\". At least our visit reminded us why we rather drive an hour round trip to Lotus of Siam than to visit this place three blocks from our house."}
{"text":"Strange service...a tad slow, but mostly they seemed irritable that we wanted to eat at their restaurant. There was a small woman who hovered around the entire night and was displeased when we didn't want drinks. At least we found it amusing.  Cucumber salad - refreshing, a tad spicy (just a tad) Satay - chicken and beef, very fatty cuts, oddly gelatinous sauce Pad Thai - I have to order the pad Thai at every Thai restaurant I visit, so I continued my predicable pattern here and wasn't too keen on this one  Overall, I think I'll stick with Panna Thai and King & I for Thai food."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place so finally came in the other night the food was OK nothing exceptional I got the pumpkin curry little lacking in flavor, the appetizer of jerky was a bit hard and chewy. The venue is nice and clean. The staff is attentive and kind but the prices are kinda high. Lighting is good for a date but probably won't be my everyday Thai food place."}
{"text":"Normally a good place, I often order lunch to go here.  Today, not only do they not give me an eggroll and crispy wonton (after they asked me for my choice) but there is only 3 shrimp in my fried rice lunch special??? And it is sooo greasy.   So disappointing.  We brought my in-laws here on Monday 5/07/18 and my shrimp fried rice lunch special had 6 shrimps!  I even shared it -- to compliment how good the food is here.  But I guess they skimp on the take out food?? For $10.77 I would hope they can get their orders right??? Ugh  well our dining out monthly Monday night group wont be coming here any more (I'm in charge of locating a restaurant that can accommodate 30-36 people). They love it here, and I used to as well until this happened!  This is just too disappointing."}
{"text":"This review is short and simple.  1. The food was very good. The rice was very good, my yellow curry was very good, my wife's shrimp dish was very good. And by very good, very tasty.  2. And this is by far the cleanest Asian restaurant we have visited in several years - no dust, no food scraps left under the table, clean walls, everything spotless. The windows, sculptures, decor and everything else - gleaming. And the restrooms amazingly immaculate.   3. The only downside. While the hostess was good, our waitress was not attentive, opting to be playful with some of her co-workers on the far side of the cash register area, as opposed to waitressing customers. At one point, we asked another waitress for hot water for the hot tea. Noting a similar review on the service, I do not doubt their assessment in this regard.   4. Neither bad nor good, the portion amount is 'right-size', no more, and the cost, not inexpensive but not expensive ~ about $40 for us both."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times. Love this place and my favorite dish is the silver noodle salad and gulf of Thailand. The service was alwsys polite and warm. Would definitely recommend and will go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place. I'd like to come back when it's cooler and eat on the patio.  The red curry was pretty good. I ordered it at a 4, and that is exactly what I got. I'd probably try it a little spicier next time. The chicken was tender and the portions were good for the price."}
{"text":"We had dinner the other night and was pleasantly surprised in every aspect. The facade is nothing special on the outside, but once you step in the decor is very exotic. Rich dark wood everywhere and detailed in Thai culture. A little modern and traditional mixed together. My wife had the two servings of the Thai Ice tea, which was much better than we've ever experienced. I tried some Thai beer, first was Chang and it was really good. Then I tried Sing-ha and didn't like it as much. (Next time I'll just stay with \"Chang\" beer). We ordered the Satay appetizer and they were fantastic! What kind of sause is that? it's GREAT! Then came the Masaman curry and my wife had another curry dish. Both were very nice and no complaints at all. I'm not a vegetarian, but I ordered tofu in my curry and although I liked it, I'll go chicken next time.  A side note about the potatoes in Thai dishes, I've been to a few Thai places and they all seem to have undercooked potatoes. One place was nearly raw, BUT I have a feeling this is the way it's suppose to be served. I\"ll have to ask one day, but three Thai restaurants all serving undercooked potatoes?  They also have a fairly extensive wine list and with lots of variety. Certain wines go well with Thai foods and their selection is impressive and surprising in it's variety. Dom Perignon? Opus? yep, they got it!  Overall a nice experience and we'll be back for sure. Good food and up scale decor. Nice!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for 12 years. Best Thai food in the northwest area in Vegas. The quality of food is consistent. The host and waiters are very friendly. The atmosphere is great for the family. The best time to come is lunch time during the weekday. Great deals on lunch specials."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Their outfits look authentic. The food! It's all so yummy.  Great prices especially for lunch"}
{"text":"Really liked the place,  especially ambience. Panang curry was great; pad thai was good but a little bit too much oil for my taste. I alwaus thought that Lotus Siam was the best place in town for thai food but this place has food as good as Lotus plus MUCH cleaner amenity, nice ambience, and better customer service. Great bar, definitely coming back for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service, and affordable prices!!! The soup is amazing!! I will return and highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm torn between how yummy the food is or how poor the service was. I came with a family of four and ordered the pot stickers appetizer coming with I believe 6 pieces? I also got the ck pad thai, the Kung pao ck, and yellow ck curry. But I waited a little longer than an hour and an half for my last dish!!!! Plus they brought our dishes two at a time so we all were eating at different times.. Such Ridiculous service.. We called out to the waitresses and waiters about 3-4 times yet none of them \"heard\" us.. Another table also didn't receive water until 30 min after being seated! There is a lot of patience I have as a person but over an hour an a half for some \"wonderful\" food. I cannot.. So! If you like Thai and don't mind waiting foreverrrrr then here is the place to go (: & if not? Make sure to have bunches and bunches of patience. (Btw. As a girl the only thing that frustrated me less? Was the hand scrubs in the BR. Lol.)"}
{"text":"Mm... so I remember taking a trip over here when they first opened up. It was just... OK. I will commend the decor, but the food was what I really wanted to see!  My boyfriend and I were hungry! We had been going on a Thai food rampage for that whole 2 weeks, it seemed. We bounced around from Thai restaurant to another and saw that this was open. I was familiar with seeing their other location near the LVAC on Rainbow/95 when I lived in the NW.   Well, their portions were small, for one... we got the spicy mint chicken. Instead they brought out spicy tofu. In the midst of our confusion and it being our first time to any Pin Kaow, my boyfriend and I figured that the chicken may be hidden somewhere underneath, and so we proceeded to mess up the cute presentation. We found no chicken between the swirling of both our forks and the plate, and later flagged down the waitress. (BTW, we were the only other guests in the room besides a couple in front of us that seemed to be enjoying an intimate conversation.) Asked her about the dish, and we found out we had gotten the wrong dish. She was a little disappointed about our messing up the plate, but did take it back and came back with what we did order. It was decent.  We also got the pad see ew. Also decent, but again... a small portion.   Oh and the Thai iced tea... I think I can drink that in 3 gulps. -sad face  Also, the rice they gave was not enough to go with the rest of our food. We had to pay for extra rice. How disappointing!  I may be spoiled by my usual Thai restaurant -- ahem* Thai House Restaurant on Silverado/Maryland-- so this may be why I'm not that impressed. But... I know I probably will not return here unless someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day, it's expected there is a lot of people. When we got in, we were seated right away so I'm like cool. The wait is not bad at all. Boy was I wrong! It took 15 minutes before somebody took our drinks and order. We got our orders every 20 minutes. We had to cancel the last two because I was already full drinking Thai tea. No apologies, from there part which is the worst part. She even asked us if we want it to go? Are you kidding me? So a nice dinner turned out to be waste. Thank you Pinkaow for making this Valentine's Day special. Smh"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Friday and ordered the red curry, level 1.  Lunch came with a small bowl of chicken and rice soup, an egg roll and i think a fried won ton with a sliver of pork and ginger in it (not sure if that's how it was supposed to be). All of that for only $8.95. Super reasonably priced and the food was really good.  I plan to head back sometime later this work week."}
{"text":"10/10 Service 11/10 Food 10/10 Decor Every time, the food is consistently fabulous. They take my order quite soon after I get seated which is great. Around 7-10 minutes later, the food comes out. Great timing, service, food, and atmosphere. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here several times because they always give me a reason to return. The Mongolian beef is juicy and made with plenty of peppers if you ask. The pineapple fried rice with raisin is a unique take on a well known dish , well worth trying if you're tired of the same old fried rice. The chowmein is good but typical westernized style Thai. I like the papaya salad here but I prefer the one at Satay Bistro. The green curry is pretty fantastic-- it comes with plenty of meat, bamboo shoots and of course, flavor. I've enjoyed their tom Khar kai (coconut milk soup) on several occasions. It's creamy, tangy, and delicious. I'm also familiar with their red curry-- an important staple at any Thai establishment. The staff is polite and respectful and  the interior and exterior are both beautiful. Good place for a date, good service and great food with generous serving sizes. If you haven't already,  you should really come down and dine here."}
{"text":"The service is very good I always feel at home their thai ice tea is one of the best. I recommend the Larb ,mint basil meat, and their beef jerky is the greatest i like it tender the sauce that comes with it is awesome. The papaya salad is great too. I love their decor and it is always relaxing .Their lunch specials are goo too nicely priced and appetizingly plated.their prices are great too."}
{"text":"From the bay area and I still say this is the most incredible thai food I've ever had. Came in for my birthday and they surprised me with a free dessert. Excellent service. It's F-ed UP GOOD!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would never recommend this place to my friends. I never knew till date that one of the ingredients in their recipes is PLASTIC.... Seriously! Who makes their guests eat plastic??? The manager, BEAU (rude, inconsiderate) whom I met did not even agree to my request of getting some extra curry. Not even when I was ready to pay extra which I already agreed to. Well! I suppose that when a customer goes to eat out with friends, he/she carries enough money. $5 for extra curry- I would happily pay $10 if I love the food.  Long story short, NOT AT ALL A GOOD PLACE TO EAT THAI FOOD."}
{"text":"The only time this restaurant ever disappoints is when I've ordered from the lunch menu. In fact one dish I can't recall but it had some kind of ground meat in it...(which the menu didn't mention) was downright disgusting. Other dishes like duck curry are a delight. It's not the best thai beef salad I've ever had, but all of the curry dishes and most of the other thai standards are terrific. I love the whole fish and the papaya salad! Beware of spice levels in the salad. Even a 2 is mouth-scorching. While I order the curries and other dishes at 5 or even 6, I stick to 1 on the salads. Take this seriously or you will be on fire!"}
{"text":"I'm Thai and when it comes to looking for authentic Thai cuisines, Pin Kaow is always the first thought that comes to mind! I love their entrees; there's many selections to choose from! I usually order panang, larb, pad see ew, pad thai, and Tom Yum majority of the time and they've always been scrumptious and splendid! I've never really ever had a bad experience with my visits here nor the South Rainbow one. So far, this place is a five-star and I highly recommend it. Food's delicious, service was consistent, wait was fair, atmosphere's welcoming and mellow, and prices are good!  (This is a copy/paste of the same review I left for the S. Rainbow Pin Kaow. Just thought I might as well leave a great review for the North as well since my experiences with both were fantastic!) Hope others can agree!"}
{"text":"Pin Kaow was definitely full of surprises. Any time you walk into a PACKED restaurant on a random weekday you know you are in for a memorable meal.  I came with 4 friends and we ordered a myriad of dishes to basically try the entire menu. Everything from pad thai to Rad Na to curry to monoglian beef. All of the dishes were offered from a spice level of 1-10 and the food was flavorful without being overpowered by spice.   The staff is quick and courteous and has no problem explaining the menu items that happen to be in Thai without looking down on the customer. I will definitely be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Super delicious, authentic Thai. Probably the very best Thai I have had in Vegas. I love all of the curry dishes, and they have great Hot Pot soups too. Great Pad See Ew and Pad Thai as well. Good for take out and dine in. And nice lunch specials - good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The stuffed chicken wings were out of this world! It must take a lot of work to debone a chicken wing, and then stuff it with some amazing ingredients, all while maintaining the structural integrity of the wing. Delicious."}
{"text":"This place was a let down and is waaay over hyped. Everything was so bland and there was absolutely no spice to the dishes, even when asking for 10 with 10 being the spiciest. I ordered a thai tea, papaya salad, beef jerky, pad see eww and my buddy ordered a mongolian beef dish. It was nothing to rave about. I wish I could move all my favorite food joints from Cali to Vegas, I'll be such a happy fatty :)   I will give this place another try but this time I will order the thai boat noodle soup. My friend, who is also from CA said it was the only one that came close to our shops in CA SO... I will give it another go. This time I will remember to ask for the spiciness to be 15."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow doesn't disappoint. The food is good and the service is speedy and attentive. The interior is cool and they keep it ethnic. The food is good. Chicken Pad Thai was tasty as was the Red Curry. There spicy / hotness is actually flavorsome. My GF usually can't hang with a 2 on the Thai hot scale she can hang with a 4 here. Not because it's off but there's a flavor to it."}
{"text":"Food was very good only reason I'm giving a bad review is because for $10.95 their portion wasn't a lot for pickup."}
{"text":"Very unpleased with the service and Food I ordered Tom Yum soup, I ordered extra shrimp  and they didnt put it in my soup and charged me $6 , it was the wrong soup. I went back in and they said that with the small amount you cant have extra shrimp  but I was charged for it and not only that they let me leave if I would not have came back I would have been played out my money... never again will I go here.. food is okay but I am only loyal to people that are loyal to me"}
{"text":"This place is super tasty, affordable, clean, and has great service!!  The staff is very accommodating and the food is amazing! My favorite was the Mongolian chicken. What's even better is the price! Makes the food sit better in your stomach!"}
{"text":"After one visit, im impressed. Very good Thai food and an extensive selection of curries, seafood, even drinks. The decor is very impressive to the point of being over the top but hey, you can tell they care a LOT about getting it right.   I got duck curry at an 8 spice level, I am used to being nearly in pain at an 8, but it was very manageable here. Very tasty dish and I'll look forward to trying more.  service was a little slow,  But they were friendly when you had their attention."}
{"text":"Best local Thai spot in Vegas! Food is seriously FANTASTIC!!! Panang curry is my favorite. All the dishes are fantastic though. Both great for take out and dine in."}
{"text":"I'm trying to try Thai food more often. I really like Pan Asian and Panna Thai is good so I bookmarked this place as well. I met a friend here yesterday. The inside is cute, wooden booths and the bar is set up nicely. We ordered the crab rangoon, beef jerky, tofu pad thai, spicy level 5, and the red curry salmon, spicy level 2. The crab rangoon was very good. I liked the accompanying dipping sauce quite a bit. It looked like chili oil but it wasn't spicy and it was a little thicker than chili oil. I didnt eat the beef jerky, but my friend said most thai places he's been to dont have it, and he enjoyed it! It seemed to be a decent sized portion as well. The pad thai was good. I thought the level 5 spice might be too much but it wasn't. It was just right! My red curry salmon was good. It could have been a touch more spicy, but sometimes, my idea of \"a little kicked up\" and the chef's idea, are vastly different. The coolest thing is they have sea salt in the bathroom for after washing your hands. It smells delightful and your hands are so smooth after. The service was great. I've read some reviews where people said the service wasn't good, but our waitress Venus was really nice and made some recommendations. The food was tasty and prices were good. I will definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends to celebrate surviving our final unit exam and decided to check it out. First impression of the place was that it was cleaner than most Thai places I have been to and it looked so nice and fancy. Thank goodness they had a cheap lunch special going on because the regular prices were a little higher than normal.   I ended up ordering the red curry and I have to say it was not really that good. It was just watery and lacked the strong taste of spices and flavoring that I commonly experience with Thai food. I got the curry with level 5 spiciness and that pretty much all I experienced in terms of flavor. The beef was okay, but some pieces were pretty chewy which is kind of weird. Although I have to admit that the little salad portion they gave me was decent and probably the best part of my meal. I just stopped eating after a while because it was like eating watered down curry with rice. Our waiter was good since he was nice.  One thing is that there was this lady who came by our table and took away our spoons for some reason. Why would you place spoons as part of the table set to begin with if you were just going to take it back? It also got kinda weird when she had to partially lay on our table to reach across to grab the rest of the spoons. She could have just asked us to help her out... Anyways, the spoons came back when we got our dishes.   Overall, this place was just okay at best. I wouldn't really come back considering it is located in a plaza with other restaurants that are probably better."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, food was alright, and very good prices."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Just like the one one lake mead. Food is just as good and has outside seating."}
{"text":"Friday...can't eat meat due to Lent.  Luckily, my awesome fiance suggest Pin Kaow.  We ordered  -Papaya Salad: We ordered a 5 out of 10 spicy, gosh it was super spicy.  We were diligent in picking out the shreds of bird's eye chili. -Tom Yum Goong:  We ordered a 6 out of 10, but it was not as spicy as the Papaya Salad...it was perfect.  When it arrived at our table, I fished out 8 pcs of medium to large size shrimps out  and put them on a small plate.  I realized I do not like overcooked shrimps.  Fishing them out will stop the cooking process.  The soup by far is my favorite. -Crab Fried Rice: The most delicious crab fried rice, out of all other Thai places that I have tried.  There are lumps of crab meat in this mix.  So good!  At the end of the meal, they bring out a small plate of orange wedges.    The server wasn't very attentive.  She wasn't so friendly either...but the food is good!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai restaurant I've ever been to! Unpretentious, friendly, great prices and I crave the food on a weekly basis. Pad Thai with fried tofu is my go to. I just wish I can find a comparable restaurant to satisfy my cravings in my city!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a really great meal here. Some colleagues in my party have dietary restrictions so most places/cuisines are ruled out. Menu is extensive here and service was excellent. If anyone cannot find something good on this menu, then they need their head examined real good!  Recommended appetizers are the chicken satay and pot stickers. I enjoyed the duck soup and my colleagues enjoyed the shrimp pad Thai, yellow curry, and the beef noodle soup.   The Thai ice tea was refreshing and tasty.  Will definitely return. A Summerlein gem!  Recommend!"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant all the time, one of my favorites. Great service & food every time. The environment is very welcoming as well."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed with this place. It's so nice in the dining area, but you never know who is preparing your food. My husband and I went there to eat last night. We had the crab rolls, a seafood pot, and the spicy basil chicken. The food was really good..... Until 4am. I woke up with stomach pains and ended up on the toilet if you get my drift. My husband got sick as well. I'm still suffering from the food. Also turns out that they were on dirty dining . Don't believe me, google it!!!! Needless to say, I will not return. Beware!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly customer service, the place is nicely decorated and let's not forget the food is amazing, I thought the Thai jerky was excellent, As well as the Curry! Will definitely be going back =D"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in all of Las Vegas. The crab wontons, Thai beef jerky, and panang are regular choices each time I go. The service is pretty great too. Your drink cup is usually refilled as soon as it is empty and your food comes out without too long of a wait."}
{"text":"We got delivery.. I think it would have been better fresh as the potstickers and crab rangoons were a little soggy from the steam from the delivery box.  Otherwise good.  We also tried to eat in after that, but the wait was crazy long..."}
{"text":"VERDICT: Some food is done very well.  You have to know what to order or you'll be sorry.  Let me start by saying what I don't like at Pin Kaow.  Their curry is not very good.  I don't know what flavor it is that sets me off, but it reminds me of uncooked flour.  I actually can't stand the flavor.  The other thing at Pin Kaow that is horrible is their chicken.  I don't know if they age their chicken before serving it or what.  Their chicken has a strange texture and is quite flavorless, unless, of course, you love the flavor of uncooked flour.  Authentic?  I hope not Now let's talk about what is good.  Their Thai beef jerky is addicting to the Nth degree.  If you've never had Thai beef jerky, you must try it.  It is one of the best foods in the world.  They take strips of beef and dry them and then, the best part, they deep fry them.  It's served with a sweet and spicy sauce.  It's truly a mouth orgasm that you have to experience.  The other item that I recommend is the Tom Ka Koon, a delicious spicy soup made with coconut milk and shrimp.  The Tom Ka at Pin Kaow has an amazing complex flavor that only comes with good Thai food.  It's another must try.  That's it.  That's all I ever get and all I ever need to get.  As far as I'm concerned, Pin Kaow should change its name to Thai Beef Jerky and Tom Ka Koon store.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love eating here. Every time my family comes into town this is the place they always ask me to bring them back to. Service is second to none and I will forever love coming to pin Kaow"}
{"text":"Great curry!! Love this place. Thought I would try somewhere new. Get the curry. Has a nice kick."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Asia food in Las Vegas. (Just for the grown-ups though)  We have dined in once but generally only do carry out. The service was pleasant but unexceptional when we ate there. It was too crowded to really have a pleasant meal.  The food is what brings us back. It is amazing! Based on my body's response, I don't think they add MSG.  You order your level of spicy taste. I recommend starting low and adding as you become familiar with their system. I enjoy food at around a 7. My wife likes her's at level 4.  The kids pallet doesn't take to the food here at all, so it is usually a take out lunch purchase. Good place to have a grown-up outing as I have not seen kids there."}
{"text":"Needed to grab a quick bite while we were out running errands. Was shocked that such a nice place had such good priced lunch specials. Has quite a bit of options as well. Pork Pad Thai and red curry were amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian restaurants in Vegas! Always has amazing food. I always order take out and it takes 15 minutes or less. My favorites are yellow curry, red curry, and the pad thai. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"** UPDATE ** Returned on a recent climbing trip and tried their green papaya salad and Thai beef jerky, both pretty good.  Bumping up a star since it is Vegas after all and not Thai Town LA. **  A Thai friend recommended this place, but seeing the NE Thai dishes on their online menu sealed the deal. I ordered nam kao tod and sticky rice to go. On the upside they did a careful job at packing the ingredients to avoid a soggy mess and everything was freshly prepared. On the downside it was mostly rice. I have been spoiled by Sri Siam in NoHo where their nam kao tod is chocked full of ginger, cilantro and Thai sausage, ground pork or chicken, and where the same order would run you $4 less. You may not get the polished wood paneling and waitstaff in fancy Thai dress at Sri Siam but I'd take better food over atmosphere any day. In context, however, this is Vegas and if I'm here and  in the mood for Issan again Pin Kaow would be my pick over Lotus of Siam hands down."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. When we moved her in 2010 this place was our favorite in the area. Now, the recipes have changed for the worse, the portions when down a little but price went up a few years ago. Heck today, I am waiting for my check and it has been over 20 minutes since we were done...still waiting. Live to get take out from here still but due to price and eating in experiences, we don't eat here near as often as we could."}
{"text":"Wow.... not expecting this!   So I was staying at the courtyard across the street - ish... and saw this place a few times in the days I was running around. Kind of in the mood for some Thai- so I thought what the heck?!  I parked in the parking lot and headed in. They have quiet a bit of neon in the windows, blacked out by the way, and somehow got the impression this was  going to be kind of dumpy. BOY WAS I WRONG!!   I walked in to get an order to go and was immediately greeted with 2 lovely women with smiles on their face saying \"welcome\". The place was absolutely beautiful incredibly clean, and beautifully put together!... This would definitely be someplace that I would go on date night! Really nicely put together. I told them I wanted to take an order to go, and was directed to the back bar ( I LOVE THIS, because who want to have date night with to go orders staring you in the face the whole night... awesome idea to do it that way). I got to the back bar and the Woman taking my order was awesome! I wanted to get the pad Thai minus egg and some spring rolls. All vegan by the way... They have a ton of vegan options on the menu. Anyway, she was super happy to replace the egg with tofu and no extra cost! She even asked if I wanted the fish sauce... Just in case on the side!!! How awesome is that. Anyway she rang me up and Then asked me if I wanted a glass of water with lemon as I waited. It was only gonna take about 10 minute she said. That was super impressive, I mean how many times have you gone to a restaurant and they offer you a glass of water while you're waiting for your to go food?... I'll answer that, NEVER!   OK so then while I was waiting I popped into the ladies room. It was absolutely immaculate even the trashcan was wiped down! Not to mention there was about a dozen fresh roses next to the sink ( photo included ) .    Came back to wait for my order, I was immediately greeted with a glass of water with ice and lemon... And about two minutes later with my order. Total waiting time from order to delivery was about five minutes!    I had it finish my glass of water yet so the woman delivering my food offered it to put it in a to go cup! I mean how nice is that. I didn't need to need the to go cup and just drink it there.   When I left about two or three people said thank you so much for coming, thank you so much, thank you... And actually looked me in the face when They said it.   From the time I walked in the time that I left I felt that I was appreciated I felt like I was noticed I felt like they really really wanted me to come back again and again because of this absolutely wonderful service!  Great job Pin Kaow on Rainbow! I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I typically judge a Thai restaurant by what I view are the staples.   Tom Kha Kai (sp), Pad see eew, curry, Thai BBQ chicken, and sweet sticky rice.   We ordered everything in a level 7/10 and it was the perfect amount of heat. You know Just enough to give you a runny nose type of spice.  Everything was delicious however service can be hit or miss. I try to order a different curry dish each time. Most recently the salmon green curry rose to the top of my favorites. Seriously, it's blow your mind delicious.   Overall I think this is a great joint and urge you to try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and usually the food is great. However today some of the chicken in my curry was raw. Chicken should never be chewy and opaque. I brought this to the attention of the server and he took the piece back to the chef.  He then came back and said the chef is sorry.  Really! Sorry for the salmonella! No management came and the chicken was on the bill. Stay away"}
{"text":"The combination fried rice and Tom Kha Kai (coconut soup) is to die for!! Love this place."}
{"text":"Convenient locations and delicious Pad Thai, this is probably my most visited restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice relaxing clean restaurant...  I love the lunch special before 3pm definitely worth every penny! The portions are a little smaller then ordering a plate ... Still plenty of food along with salad and soup! The food is delicious !! Excellent customer service!!!! I will be be back!!!"}
{"text":"I would definitely give this place five stars. The decorations are great, service is great and last but not least, the food is amazing!   I ordered Padt Thai with Fried Tofu, Beef Jerky, Chicken with basil and they were all so tasty! The Padt Thai here is my fave in all that I've tasted in Vegas.   For dessert I ordered the table Thai tea creme br√ªl√©e and coconut ice cream with sticky rice. I really enjoyed both but liked the br√ªl√©e a bit more.   I would also like to add that that this place was packed on a Friday night but they found a way to seat us right away. The servers were quick, friendly, and very helpful.   I'm glad this place is right around the corner. They'll be seeing my face around a lot :)"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for a year since we moved here!!! Consistent tasting food, great service and always fast!!! We will miss this thai restaurant when we move!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there this week and I gotta say - I am just not sure why folks rave about Pin Kaow.  I've tried 2 of the 3 locations here in the valley and I am disappointed everytime I go and try it again.  Just doesn't seem super fresh and the chicken is pressed.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I don't feel that the reviews that I read of recent lived up to my experience tonight. Pin Kaow has a nice atmosphere when you walk inside, but being seated is another story. That seemed to be something more of a, \"is there someone who will help me?\" situation.  It wasn't particularly busy on a Monday night, but by the speed of the service you'd have thought otherwise. Our server didn't understand our order of edamame and two chicken Pad Thais originally so we went over it in detail again. Not that big of a deal, but the edamame took over twenty minutes to reach the table.   In the mean time the table to the right of us mentioned their calamari being too fishy and asked for spring rolls to substitute. That was receive before any of our order and the table to the left had an issue with the size of the soup they ordered (they wanted two bowls, not two cups). It took around 45 minutes to receive the order of Pad Thai which was just okay.  Afterwards I did not feel well and without sharing too much information, would not recommend this restaurant. There's a decent amount that could be said about the service, but I don't want to put it all on our waitress. So in the end I feel like it was a 1-2 star experience and I don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Hard for me to give this place a straight forward rating: Used to eat at the rainbow location a handful of years back, and both have went down in quality from what I remember, and up in price. Not saying the quality is low, but that I remember it to be amazing, and now its ''good.'' I eat thai often, and will go here for a safe and sure meal. Just remember what it was and how it is now, so I have to give it 3. ( Really wish the curry portions were larger)  : ) Still good food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice before and it was really good, but last night was just awful. I had lemon chicken. There was barely any sauce, but the waiter brought more when I asked for it. Lemon should be tart; this was sticky sweet. The chicken was coated in what tasted like cookie dough! Not the best flavor at all. The top off was when I saw they charged me $2 extra for the brown rice! Somehow the waiter had failed to mention that, and when I complained, I got lip service. They did not take it off the bill. C'mon people; rice of any color is cheap!"}
{"text":"Yum!  We go here at least once a month, and the food is always tasty.  I think it's just slightly more expensive than some of the Thai places nearby, but it's definitely worth it.  The inside is adorable--it's all carved wood and dark colors.  The Thai iced teas are average size--not giant like Thai House or Archi's, but also not tiny.  The best things I've had: Pad Thai, red curry, Pad Kee Mao, panang curry, and Thai beef salad.  All of it has been delicious!  I recommend this place if you're on this side of town and you want some consistently good food.  By the way, I was in here the other day for lunch and a woman was flipping out about something, and the poor servers handled it beautifully.  I have no idea if the woman's complaints were valid, but she was treating them horribly and they were very considerate and kind to her.  I was impressed by that, and I know that they've always been nice to me."}
{"text":"I thought I knew what good Thai food was until I came here.  A friend recommended we have dinner here as he loves this place. I just gotten out of Pilates class and wanted to eat something \"healthy.\" To which Thai food, is as healthy as can be these days.  He had gotten the pad-see-ew; and I got their Pin Kaow specialty catfish. Again, I wanted to stick to fish for the \"healthy\" part of my meal.  The workers were extremely friendly considering the dinner rush was in full tow.   While waiting on the entrees, I sipped on my thai ice tea to which I really REALLY liked. It wasn't as sweet as most places do it which is allllllllllllll good to me.  Our food came; and let me tell you that the pad-see-ew was the best I've ever had. Not greasy, lots of flavor (not fat), and lots of veggies.  The catfish came out and; to be quite honest, I didn't know what I expected but, it was the BEST THING EVER! I think it was WHOLE catfish oil fried (not to be mistaken with deep fried IN hot oil) and covered with lots of veggies and sauce. OHHHHHHHH, that sauce. It was the 1st time my friend had had it and he loved it, as well. The portions wer so large, I wound up taking the leftovers to my boyfriends where he and his roomies loved the fish, too!   Since discovering Pin Kaow, I, literally, came here every day for a whole week to eat the pad-see-ew. I would eat the catfish but, that's something I wouldn't be able to finish on my own."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I have my favorite dishes and when I feel like trying something new it's always yummy. Beef Satay is my new favorite menu item. The peanut sauce is bomb. If you like Thai food, you will soon have them on speed dial."}
{"text":"They messed up with my order three times I decided not to complain since I always get lunch here.. and when I let them know tge chineses lady at cashier just says sorry???? Really????? Like wtf I pay 12 for spicy basil not beef salad!!!! And complaint after the third time!!! Well going to stop coming here lost my service and friends and family."}
{"text":"My son and I went there last night and ordered several dishes to go. We ended up waiting about 15 to 20 minutes for the food. The place was very busy when we arrived. I had been here once before with my wife and we just were not impressed with the food. We thought we would try and order some different dishes. Unfortunately, the food was not very good and we had ended up spending about $55.00. We usually go to Archie's and the food has always been food there. Do to this bad experience, we will return back to Archie's. There food is much better and actually less money. Sorry, about the bad review, but it is the truth. They were busy, so go figure."}
{"text":"Good food, lunch specials are a good deal, and the ambiance was nice.  Their spice scale of 1-10 never got truly spicy."}
{"text":"Food tastes authentic. Ambience reminds me of good days in Thailand, very traditional. Price is okay, i would have given 5 stars if the appetizer came before our main entr√©e. I'm coming back though :)"}
{"text":"Food is good here and the ambience is also a plus but sometimes the service would just suck. Also when you call to place an order for either pick or delivery, they put you on hold for so long that you just want to hang up. I hung up just now. Was on hold for exactly 7mins and 15secs."}
{"text":"If you're a big spender with a bird like appetite, then Pin Kaow is definitely up your alley. With growling stomachs and anticipation for family style dishes, we were quite disappointed with the small portions attached to a beefy price tag.  3 adults ordering 3 entrees, couldn't you have been a bit more generous with the rice rather than giving us one tiny saucer that cant even feed a 5lb alley cat?? Its like ordering a big mac with half the top of a bun. It was a good thing I ordered brown rice (dry)  in which they forgot and charged $3 a cup.   Our somewhat irritating experience didn't help when the manager came over to our table and showed concerns we were bringing in boba drinks but she let it slide. I didn't see eye to eye with her concerns as we were there to dine in and spend a nice amount for dinner. We aren't there to order water and occupy your wifi connection lady.  The food is good, but it isn't anything different than the ASIAN BISTRO section at the buffets. Pin Kaow may have the fancy marble floors, but asians needs their rice!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is definitely romantic inside, very nice traditional Thai decor. Nice and cool temperature. The outside does not do the restaurant justice.  We had the beef pad see ew and the yellow curry. They were both excellent though Jonny prefers a friend's mom's cooking.  The service was excellent, they didn't let my fish boyfriend go dry.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is complicated.  First the ambiance was awesome.  The Satay Beef was incredible tasting which should rank a solid 4.  But a couple of just plain weird things.  It appeared as though a restroom was located in the main dining area.  Maybe I'm a freak, but that's what it looked like.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef with a 7 for spiciness.  Although good, I've had better and kind of expected a better tasking entree.  Not to mention a horrible wait for the check.  So... with the weird restroom and lackluster taste of the food, I had to go with a 3."}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch, we ordered papaya salad, pak kew mauo and crab fried rice. We ordered spicy level of 6, a bit more than usual medium spicy, but a good one that my mouth wasn't burning and neither my stomach ha. They have lunch special from 11-3pm and after 3pm, they serve dinner menu.   Services was excellent, our waiter constantly stopped by our table and see if we need anything else.   Parking was easy since the restaurant is located in a plaza.   Bathroom is clean with a nice smell. :p  **They used to have another location in Rainbow and Robindale, however they have sold it. Bummer."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant when I'm craving Thai because I know they're consistent with their food preparation. I recommend the green curry, and shrimp fried rice.  The atmosphere is family friendly, clean and reasonably priced. I feel that their heat index is not on point.  I've picked up food on several occasions, the phone staff speaks little English and always gets my name wrong. Delivery times have always been slow."}
{"text":"Came in to try it out, asked the supervisor for suggestions and cant give one. So i tried wings and yellow curry which is pretty much basic as it is not bad or not spectacular. Workers arent proud of what they do, not as friendly as they should be. Its like they are just waiting for their 8 hour shift.   Was leaving and said thank you, supervisor did not even say something. Tipped 20% and was regretful for it.   Food is basic Service is pale 2 stars for ambiance which is really nice for a first date Alot of thai places around which will be more affordable Not coming back."}
{"text":"Beef Satay and Tofu Pad Thai was spot on! Minus one star for no limes with the Pad Thai and it was a tad on the bland side. Just needed a bit more spice, so I think I'll make sure I get it a little spicy next time :) I got take out but the ambiance looked great for dining in!"}
{"text":"Lovely ethnic decor, friendly service, good food. I prefer my green curry with slighly less coconut milk and more spice, but the pad thai was great. We've been back multiple times, as this is the only northern restaurant similar to what we were used to in California."}
{"text":"One of the Best Pad Thai in town. When I'm craving Thai food there are only 2 places I go in town. This is one of them. Big Fan!"}
{"text":"first I wanna say the service was great and so welcoming.  second, I ordered chicken pad Thai and pot stickers.   the pad Thai had good flavors and I like that they put a lot of bean sprouts on the side for you to mix in. the chicken was a little dry (that's why it's not 5 stars) but it was still edible and I ate most of what was on my plate and just left most of the chicken.   the potstickers were fried which are my favorite and they served them with a soy ginger sauce, very very excellent, I definitely recommend as an appetizer"}
{"text":"Loved the Nam Khao Tod, but that was about it. We ordered entrees, and the nam khao tod, but didn't get the entrees for almost an hour. We were left alone for much of the meal. The waitress came by once and said oh you need water.? And then walked away without ever returning or refilling our drinks. When the waitress finally returned we asked for a to-go box and the bill and we were given boxes but not the bill. The overall vibe wasn't welcoming. I came in with good expectations, and ate with a friend who had dined here several times. She always had great experiences. But based off of my experience, I won't be coming back or recommending to anyone. It's too bad."}
{"text":"Great food... Great service... There is a very comfortable cozy atmosphere. The prices are reasonable and you get a good amount of food. This was my first time and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty average Thai restaurant in Henderson. One of the few, so by default, one on the best. I had tom yum koong soup, and it was very good, and then for the entree I had garlic chicken, which was ok, but kind of bland. The restaurant itself is very nice, and the staff was quick and friendly. I'll go back when i am craving Thai food, and dont want to drive too far."}
{"text":"Great Thai food! I love their lunch specials. Surprisingly, the inside of this strip mall restaurant has beautiful wood paneling."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars for the food.  I love it and everyone i bring here loves it.  1 star for the service though.  Consistently horrible, barely see the wait staff every time.  Last night it took them 15 min to get our drinks, even though people seated after us had gotten theirs.  My bf wanted to start with soup, they never brought it, and when they brought our entrees the server left so quick we didn't have time to ask them about it.   Of course no one came to check on us after (my drink was also empty the whole time).When finally they came when we were both done, they said that they accidently brought the soup to the wrong table.. ok.. why wouldn't they take a min to figure out who the right table was?!Another time they brought me the wrong entree, and then it took them over 20 min to find change for us when we paid. Don't even let me get into the time they totally forgot about us sitting on the patio...  I really wish the staff would get their act together, because the food is really good.  I won't be going back for awhile, I have given them too many chances."}
{"text":"I have had thai food from 3 or 4 places here in Vegas, and I think Pin Kaow is by far the best.  I'm confused by some of the reviewers who said that they have received rude or poor customer service, because every time I go here, the staff are all extremely polite, friendly, and courteous, even when it's really busy and stressful for them.   The chili fried rice with beef is probably my favorite fried rice of any Asian restaurant that I've been to in my life.  All of the other entrees are very good as well, love the garlic chicken and the spicy basil entree.  I always get a spicy level 3, and it is still very spicy for me, but in a good way, so if you can't handle too much heat then stick to a level 2 or 3 when they ask how spicy you want your meal to be.  I tried the deep fried cream cheese jumbo shrimp appetizer, and it was good but didn't wow me, so I probably won't order that again.  The service is fast, the food is fresh and flavorful, and the price is right for the quantity.  I'll be back probably once a week."}
{"text":"Rude! Would not make accommodations for dairy free in their Thai iced tea. They could not speak English well and didn't understand my questions about contents of dishes."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Especially when someone else is paying.  Seriously, is it me or are the waitresses so cute in those traditional Thai outfits. Definitely helps the food go down. Food tasted very good, the spices they use are definitely authentic stuff from Thailand. Being part Thai, yes I would know. Aside from being way pricey, it's a good dining experience."}
{"text":"The food served here exceeded my expectations. It didnt look like much from the outside. I would try another Thai restaurant around the same area just to see if it was better and have another option just in case but would definitely eat here again.  The waitress we had was not very friendly but others were and the servers were nice too. She must have been having an off day..."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent Thai restaurant in Henderson.  The decor of the place is nice, and the restaurant is spacious.  I have to always order the Pad Thai first to get a general idea of a Thai place.  The pad thai didn't disappoint.  Thank you!  I also ordered the Ka Pow, a spicy mint dish which I ordered with chicken.  Not bad at all.  I wish I could've ordered more food, but I wasn't too hungry at the time.  Service was hospitable, and people were friendly.  There isn't much of a need for me to go to Archi's as much anymore for good Thai food."}
{"text":"I'm having some bad luck lately getting actually spicy Thai food. I order it on the high side of the spicy scale, but this meal was probably a 0/10. Come on, I can handle it.   This place is like, upscale. The interior is decorated with some really ornate wood carving architecture and the staff was wearing suits and saris in the middle of the day. Seemed strange to me, but whatevs. The staff was pleasant, letting me sit and work a bit on some things while I finished my food. Full bar and specialty cocktails, though I did not partake since I was on my way to work.  I'm willing to give it another chance because $7 lunch specials are $7 lunch specials, but it's got to have some heat to it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas!! The pad Thai is always on point service is great as well! I have also had other dishes here and it is always delicious! It is definitely my go to spot"}
{"text":"When I moved to Las Vegas I didn't think I would find a great Thai food place since my search for great Chinese has been such an epic fail.  But during my search I came across this place and I feel in love at first bite. The food is delicious and so flavorful a little pricey but worth every penny. The place is never empty and the servers are attentive and fast even with a packed house.  We eat here at least three times a month. ...yes we have a problem. .....We are addicted to the chicken chow mein, mongolian beef and green curry.....yum.. yum...yummy."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to meet a friend.  It was Sunday (Super Bowl) afternoon so the place was understandably empty.  We were greeted by four (4) staff members and was seated right away.  We were the only customers.  Wasn't planning on pigging out because I wanted to catch the game.  We ordered our drinks, Thai Iced Coffee and diet Coke, as we sat down.   We ordered pretty much the same dish, my friend ordered Beef Pad See Ewe, and I ordered Beef Rad Na (basically, pad see ewe soup).   The drinks came quite quickly.  The drinks were in cocktail glasses and personally i thought they were a tad small for one serving.  The coffee was MEH!  Didnt feel the caffeine kick at all.    The food came and of course they looked identical because the only difference was that the other was dry, and the other, a soup-like dish.  The servings were MEH!.  Normally, a dish could be easily shared by two, but their servings weren't even enough for one adult.  I think they cooked both our orders the same time, in the same pot and just divided in half and poured sauce on the other.  My friend wasn't hungry but he finished and cleaned his plate (that tells you how small the serving was). Taste, flavoring, spice, heat and seasoning were a-OK.  I had much better, and a lot more, Thai food in other Thai restaurants.    Service was OK.  I was just wondering how come we were never served water, or was there a need to ask for it?    I don't think I'll be coming back here considering the many choices I have around the valley."}
{"text":"When in the mood for some great thai food, this is the place. I have sensitive stomach and never had an issue here. And food taste awesome. slightly higher price then other thai , but well worth it."}
{"text":"Seeing as I am from Chicago, the land of the best Thai food outside of Thailand, I'm a tough customer in Vegas. I am grateful, however, for Pin Kaow and that it's up in the NW where I live. It is located on Rainbow, just across Lake Mead's Best of the West shopping area. The decor is nice, warm and inviting. The staff is polite and very accommodating. In that it is the only good thai place up north, it can get really busy, so I recommend you get there early on weekends. The pad thai is really good as is the Tom Kha soup. yummmmm. If you are longing for the ethnic dining of a city that has a real urban center (notice dig...), ride your chop sticks on over to Pin Kaow. I think you'll thank your sticky rice you did."}
{"text":"Worst service and blah food. No flavor. When I asked for a military discount, she got her supervisor and she said she couldn't give us a discount because my cousin wasn't in uniform. I explained that he can't just go out on a normal day with his uniform. He has his dog tags on his neck and his military ID. They still refused because the cameras will see that he's not wearing uniform. Won't ever be coming back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food in town. The duck fried rice and Tom Yum soup are my favorites, but everything they have is delicious. Ordering online is easy enough, but it's nice that they call to verify the order right away. Great service and food."}
{"text":"When I found out that they opened a Pin Kaow in Green Valley, I knew we had to stop on the way back to Phoenix for lunch.  Their other 2 locations are 2 of my favorite Thai restaurants on the planet.  Would Pin Kaow 3 be able to meet those standards...?  Why yes of course!  Wifey had the Pad See Ew, $9.95 with Thai spice Level 3 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pin-kaow-3-henderson?select=cbiOvOJPrwGHF4ze14KgDw#cbiOvOJPrwGHF4ze14KgDw  I had the Crispy Tofu Pad Thai, $9.95 with Thai spice Level 7 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pin-kaow-3-henderson?select=j4IyhsLwTvA4UeQo0CeLAw#j4IyhsLwTvA4UeQo0CeLAw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pin-kaow-3-henderson?select=jgl3PClGu3OzDDzj7_ujwg#jgl3PClGu3OzDDzj7_ujwg  Both dishes were awesome!  The Pad Thai was a delish as I remember it....and the Level 7 spice was perfect.  I was tempted to go Level 9 or 10, but I didn't want to press my luck.  We devoured both of our dishes in no time.  Wish we had one in Phoenix.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite restaurants.  We eat here at least once a month.  Food - Some of our favorite dishes are the Pad Thai Tofu, Pad See Ew, Spicy Chicken Curry.  For appetizers, we enjoy the Sweet & Sour Cucumbers and the Edamame.  When you order your entree, you tell the waiter how spicy you want your food on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the spiciest level.  I generally get a 5 or 6.  Service - The employee to customer ratio in this restaurant is pretty high.  My guess is that they don't make very much in terms of an hourly wage.  Either way, the service is always good.  Will I return?  You bet!"}
{"text":"A solid 4stars. Service was fast, food was on my table quick. Whenever i try someplace new i go easy on the heat, I ordered \"4\" spicy, I could have gotten a 6 and been perfect heat. I ordered my favorite, panang chicken."}
{"text":"Great food, but terrible service! They screw up but are unwilling to back it up. Terrible business practice! I won't be going back, And I was a long standing loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to Pin Kaow since 2007, I have visited both the eastern location as well as the south rainbow location. Either location NEVER disappoints, delicious food and great service. The prices are a little steep, but with exploring other thai restaurant options that were less expensive they did not stack up against Pin Kaow. Yum."}
{"text":"Great Thai spot!!! everything was delicious!   Crispy Rice Salad - great snack for drinking! My favorite dish of all because it kept its crunciness well.  Duck Fried Rice - as good as it gets  Lettuce wrap - nothing special"}
{"text":"I visited Pin Kaow 2 before and I thought this one would be the same but it is not. The food was slightly more salty IMO. I like the second location better. Service was decent.  -Duck Fried Rice : a must get here. The rice and duck were moist and flavorful.  -Pa Kao - It is a seafood version of Tom Yum. Soup was too sour.  -Salt and Pepper Soft Shell Crab - it was really good but a bit salty. meant to be a dish to be eaten with rice I guess but we were too full. Spicy alert! There was green chilies in the dish. Beware.  -Steamed Seabass Bangkok style - my favorite dish!!! the seabass was tender and creamy. The sauce complimented the fish well  -Mango Salad - it was alright. did not like it with the tofu.  -Pad Prik King - This dish should be in the sauteed section. Our was beef sauteed with green bean in curry spices. Dry dish. It is not a curry dish with broth/ soup like other curry dishes. Pretty good."}
{"text":"We go here for either my birthday or my mom's birthday. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. The only thing I have a problem with is the spiciness of some of the food we order. Depending on who makes it, it can be pretty mild to pretty hot. But other than that, service is good and so is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Now THIS is an excellent Thai restaurant! . When they say \"Chinese broccoli \" you get Chinese broccoli. See pix. Its in a strip mall but you walk in and the atmosphere makes you forget asphalt strip malls and Vegas. Warm wood panels and pillars make you feel cozy and comforted.    The BEST Tom Kha (except I had shrimp instead of chicken) soups I've ever had. Lots of shrimp (tender), lots of lime, coconut, chunks of ginger and galangal. Excellent. I also had duck with Chinese broccoli. The duck was sliced thin, was tender and the entire dish was lightly covered with a not-too-sweet delicious sauce. I don't get to Vegas much and won't miss it, but I will miss this restaurant."}
{"text":"I always bring my friends from out of town here. Food is really good and cheap. The waiters are always ready to help and they even dress in authentic thai attire! Also the whole restaurant is pure thai culture. You feel like you step into Bangkok. If you check in you get a free thai iced tea. I love getting the coconut soup and spicy mint noodles."}
{"text":"I've been on a journey to find some really good Thai food. I was pretty stoked to try this place. My friend and I just coincidently passed and decided to give it a try. The location felt kind of random, there's not much around it.   Atmosphere: The lighting was pretty dim, which was fine. We were confused at first because it was empty and dark, we thought it was closed. A waitress popped out from the back and seated us.   Food: I'm not that into pad thai, but once in awhile I'll get a craving. I decided to give it a try and satisfy my craving. It was okay, not \"omg I need to have it again,\" but I probably won't need to have it again for awhile. They ask the scale of spiciness you want 1-10. I decided to get a 6 so there would be a little bit of kick, but not too much. I didn't really notice the spice when I ate it.   My friend thoroughly enjoyed his eggplant plate if you're in the mood for something different!  I think I'll come here again and try the curry.   Service: The waitress was kind of attentive. It took us awhile to get our bill. We were just sitting and talking, waiting for the bill to come. But at least she gave us a refill on our water a couple of times!"}
{"text":"Was in for lunch yesterday with my hubby. Food was great. Service amd staff were fast and friendly. Place was clean with nice atmosphere. We had mongolian shrimp, pad thai, and some fried rice. Most of the food was gone before i remebered to get a pic. We will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurant. My favorites are the pad thai and the panang curry. The staff are very friendly and great lunch specials"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food place in Vegas hands down!!!  We order here often and we have never been disappointed!! I love the chicken pad see ew. I order a seven spicy level and though it's spicy the flavor is great. The yellow curry is amazing. This is a most go place"}
{"text":"Eeeeeh as far as the food goes it was ok....I have had Aaaaaahhhhhmazing Thai food before so it has to be incredible to get more stars than the 3 I gave. Had peach sangria, pot stickers, spicy basil beef and beef pad thai. The sangria was yummy!!  All three dishes were good, hot and fast. Portions to me were very small compared to other Thai places. I feel like the noodle were a bit over cooked and not enough flavor. Prices were ok but again going back to the portion size....... I have paid less and gotten more. On the other hand service and people were great. Don't think I would recommend this Thai place over my other though."}
{"text":"I love all the items on their menu, but over the past year my wife and I have decided to become vegan. Well, with Pin Kaow that's not a problem. Each time we've requested a vegan option the wait staff has been very accommodating and they have explained the best options for us. This place is great. I highly recommend it, especially the pineapple fried rice."}
{"text":"They have amazing food. I really like the place. The only problem is that sometimes they burn incense which makes it impossible to eat there. My friends and I wanted to eat there yesterday (Saturday), but the incense was so strong it was giving us a headache. They don't burn it all of the time, but I wish they wouldn't use it at all. There are more and more people who are sensitive to scents."}
{"text":"I love Thai food!  Yum Yum!  I ate at Pin Kaow tonight and had Won-ton Soup, OMG it was so delicious, and I also ordered Shrimp in mixed vegetables, definitely a must for the active person and those of us who watch what we eat on a healthy side!   The dining area was very clean, warm feeling, and could have nice conversation and the staff all smiles and professional, and my drinks were never empty.   Great place to take a date, family or friend and I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Red curry chicken is the best! I was suggested by A friend to visit this place. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Pin Kaow based on a Vegas friend's recommendation (it's his favorite Thai place in Vegas), and it was exceptional. The staff members are very friendly and attentive, and the food is excellent. We both had appetizers (crab rangoon and chicken satay), tom ka soup, and I had pad see ew and my friend had the Pin Kaow version of drunken noodles (I don't remember what they called it). The food was presented beautifully and tasted excellent. Probably the best Thai I've had, and definitely recommended. If you want great food in Vegas, get away from the Strip!"}
{"text":"Well, all of the reviews are right... this place is the bomb!  After doing some late night shopping at Best Buy, my friends and I thought we'd give Pin-Kaow a try.  Fast service and great food.  Doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Pin Kaow and the one in the Southwest, and they are both really good..  My favorite is the pad see ewe and shrimp appetizer, which I recommend..  I've tried a couple of the curries, and if you get it spicy, it will definitely come spicy, so beware!"}
{"text":"after 1 visit  ambience B+ loved the decor, however, the lighting was quite dark. it was hard to see anything.   service B+ i would have given pin kaow an A, however, they over-killed on the table touches. i think we had 5 people check on us in the matter of 5 minutes.   food B+ i enjoyed the dishes, but it didn't make me say, \"wow, this is REALLY good.\"  chicken satay the chicken was grilled perfectly. the peanut sauce (most likely an authentic sauce), fell a little flat on my palate.  tom ka koong lemon grass soup with coconut milk, galanga root, mushroom, and shrimp great in small doses. i could only eat one small bowl, because it was a rich and slightly sour broth. the sourness wore on me at the end of one bowl. that same sourness is why so many people love this soup. it's just not for my palate.  roasted rice beef beef, cabbage, roasted rice, thai basil and spices roasted rice is a new concept for me. basically, it is crushed rice that has been roasted and scattered on the beef. interesting texture and a great experience. but not my favorite dish.   chicken yellow curry delicious.  overall: B+ hope to be able to visit this place again. sample some other dishes i've never sampled before."}
{"text":"The Pad-Thai is delicious and I enjoy the decorations, however I sense a minuscule hostility from the staff. It may be coming from management and it's tricking down. Great food for the price."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and pleasant. The Pad-Thai and Tom Ka Gai Soup are the Best! It's uncomfortable to see their idol statues. Food-5 Stars."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, so I haven't tried many things on the menu. I normally order the Vegetable Pad See Ew, Yellow Curry with Fried Tofu (zero spice level) and the Sweet Rice with Coconut Ice Cream for dessert. I've had those items elsewhere, and Pin Kaow 3 definitely takes those places out!!! Also, their service is great. They are so kind to me whether I dine-in or take-out.  :)"}
{"text":"Great experience overall. We came to visit family here in Vegas from Long Beach, California and never had thai food and it was soo delicious. Everything was great from service to food. :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the chicken panang. Great curry and good prices. The inside is pretty and can be a nice date location. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I went there with my girl today the restaurant itself was really nice. Food was alright we ordered crying tiger, coconut lemongrass soup and chicken pad thai. Everything together was around 40 bucks. A lil bit more expensive than other thai restaurants I've been to but it's understandable since this location is very nice and decorated well. Staffs were friendly. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I had the option. Food tasted alright. Soup was too sour and so as pad thai. Crying tiger was good though."}
{"text":"Another Thai favorite off Eastern in Henderson. There are multiple locations but I can only vouch for this location. 9 out of 10 times the food is spot on! :) Go for it! ;)"}
{"text":"We stick to our usual when we come to Pin Kaow, we order the Tom Ka Kai, which is this scrumptious soup with mushrooms chicken and a coconut lemony broth... The taste is so much better than the description, I promise. We also get the pad see ew, which is perfect if you love stir fry noodles. The beef and greens that come with it, top it off PERFECTLY. We also get the pad Thai every once in a while."}
{"text":"I love Pink Kaow # 2 on South Rainbow.  For some reason, the quality of the food, and most importantly, the quality of service is up to par and should be followed by Pin Kaow 3.    Pin Kaow 3 quality of food is 2 stars compared to Pin Kaow 2.   Pin Kaow 3 quality of service is 1 star compared to Pin Kaow 2.  When we request for brown rice, the extra charge price has varied from $0.50 to $3.00; that makes no sense and is not good to advertise incorrect charges.  Not cool.    Because I work near by I always give it a shot here and its a hit or miss situation.  I'd rather go to # 2!  Better food and way better service!"}
{"text":"The service is great! Sue the manager came to our table to check on us and she was a sweetheart. The best dish was the Seafood Soup Po-Tak very tasty and full of seafood. And the Soft Shell Crab dish out if this world! I'm from LA and will definitely visit Pin Kaow again on my next visit."}
{"text":"Of all the Thai restaurants I've eaten at, this one is not bad. The food tastes good and is usually brought out promptly after ordering. They do try to rush you out of the restaurant at the end of the meal though. Recently, my friends and I wanted some Thai food on St. Patrick's Day and it was surprisingly one of the only ones open later into the evening. We tried a couple others on the neighborhood but they all closed early. Who knew St. Patty's would affect a Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Located just off the 1-95 and Lake Mead off Rainbow, it's one of my favorite thai restaurants.  We came in for lunch and we were seated right away in a booth which I prefer. Nice friendly hostess.    Ambiance is dark, cool and cozy.  Waiter came right away to take our drink order which on scorching hell days like this when you feel like a lizard you're so thirsty you'd drink out of a water hose if that's all they had so speedy drink order service was appreciated!  Ordered off the lunch menu and I have to say options seemed limited.  I chose the red curry with scallops and it was very tasty, it came with soup and it was full of flavor. Overall I would come back.  The Thai Iced Tea is fabulous."}
{"text":"Walking in the place looks awe inspiring... Buuut the service sucks. Got servers darting every which way but mine. The food is AWFUL... But I get it.   The people around here don't care about actual good flavored food, because it's pretty and makes them feel nice and privileged when they treat themselves to this dog food."}
{"text":"I had the pineapple rice. Overall it was good. I was hoping for more shrimp. In the whole dish their were only two shrimp. Service was good. If I knew there was going to be non existent shrimp I would've ordered something else instead of paying $12.95 for rice, pineapple & chicken."}
{"text":"God.. I don't know where to start.. I've never written a review, but I feel as if I have to because of my terrible experience. Basically, I ordered two fried tofu pad Thai entrees online to be delivered, and it took longer than an hour and a half for the food to arrive. Once they did, I opened the containers to find that there was meat in both meals. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Don't judge a book by its cover. This place looks kinda ghetto from the outside. Inside it's very nice. Service was great as well. We had the chicken red curry and chicken pad thai, very tasty."}
{"text":"Had a great experience on Friday night!  We walked in and were greeted right away.  The decor is simple, but elegant. The place was full, but we were seated in the last booth, which made me excited.  The server was very attentive, greeted us. and was prompt throughout the meal.  We ordered chicken pad see ew and chicken panang. It was delicious. The only thing I can say is that their spicing grading system can be off.  I love the heat, but my husband not as much. He had beads of sweat rolling off his head."}
{"text":"Had the red curry and yellow curry. Was incredible !! Delicious food. We got level 5 for spicy and it was perfect not too hot not too mild. We also got the wonton soup, probably the best I've ever had from anywhere. Thai tea was also great. And the reason for five stars? The service. Really felt catered to and taken care of. Excellent service and sweet staff. Really happy and will be back!"}
{"text":"I really love their curry, beef salad, and sweet basil. So good and great customer service."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I usually always get the whole fried fish, cause I love any fish that is served with the head and tail!  This time around we tried a few different things: Ground Pork Larb- was a little dry ( maybe I'll try the chicken larb next time) but it had great flavor and you could really taste the rice powder (which I love) but could be an acquired taste for some. Green curry with chicken- not too sweet, which is a good thing cause I always stay away from Thai curries cause most places make it way too sweet.  They did a good job of balancing the sweetness, spices and salt. Pad See Eew combination meat- noodles were not overcooked and again, not too sweet, flavor was good.  A few things I'll do differently next time- the meat seems like it was overcooked in both dishes, next time I'll stick with tofu and veggies or shrimp but the mister likes neither tofu or veggies :(  I do like Pin Kaow though- I'll just need to try a few other Thai places before I can say more or less whether it's that good..."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant when we are in the mood for Thai food.  The atmostphere was dim lit, friendly and the d√©cor was typical Thai, nothing stand out.  The stuffed chicken is our favorite, the tom-yom soup was always salty to my taste.  The panang curry with fried fish was great and the Pineapple fried rice with crab was excellent too. The rest of other stuff was just average. We don't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant deserves 5 stars.  I'm a major Thai curry fan and Pin Kaow makes some of the best I've had.  All the food is phenomenal for a reasonable price.  The servers are extremely friendly, greet you with a smile, and knew my name and favorite dish after only eating there twice.  They have a full bar and definitely mix first-rate cocktails.    Updating this two weeks past original review:   I love Pin Kaow like Rob loves Big"}
{"text":"Just like a high quality restaurant in Bangkok.  Recommend the green papaya salad and chicken lop before your entre.  My wife and I are returned Peace Corps Volunteers in Thailand so we have high standards for what's good Thai.  Pin Khao is. Good."}
{"text":"Edit 2/17/13 -- My boyfriend and I headed to Pin Kaow 3 for a local bite before heading downtown for the evening...what a mistake! The service was painfully slow and we waited for 20 minutes for our water. Our curry took another 20 minutes and our waitress never came back to check on us. Boo.   Pin Kaow is a stones throw away from my place so when I came down with the flu I called them up for my go to, feel better,  stand by of tom ka kai with side of sticky rice. Too bad the soup was a tiny little portion and it was so salty and thick  I ended up thinning it out with water. Definitely not the kind of hassle you want when you feel crumm-ola. I ended up paying $12 total for about one cup of soup and a small side of sticky rice. Bums. On the bright side, the sticky rice was warm and delish."}
{"text":"My second go round for Thai food, the first a long long time ago as a child turning my nose up at the food and refusing to eat it.  This time, not so bad, I am able to read and I know what stuff is.  Still coming here I was weary of what to get so I kept it simple with sweet and sour pork or was it chicken?  I can't remember and honestly I couldn't tell.  All I know it was chewy and sweet and not at all spicy like I had dreaded.    The restaurant was beautiful and all the staff was dressed to the nines.  I loved the traditional Thai garb the staff was wearing and all the big bosses were equally well dressed in business suits.  The staff was also very attentive with removing dishes and getting the orders in.  In a group of five and one late arrival, with tons of appetizers and dishes abound the manager took our order without a note pad and got everything right.  Very impressive.   I doubt I'd come back here on my own because I'm not a fan of spicy and it seems they have a lot of stuff I'm allergic to in a bunch of the dishes.  Even the sweet and sour um, whatever it was had tomato in it.  The Thai iced tea was pretty good.  My friend mentioned it's either something you really love or something you really hate.  To me it was something I could really like.  Nice place and super busy but the staff handled it like real professionals.  I would recommend it if your up north and in the mood for Thai food."}
{"text":"Ambience: The inside of the restaurant looked really traditional.  Food: The food was delicious. The portions are a lil smaller than other Thai locations. I recommend the Panang Curry and Pad See Ew.   Price: Is more expensive than other local Thai restaurants.  Great for date nights and family dinners."}
{"text":"Love this place. Wor wonton soup is soooo great on a cold day and combination fried rice is super. We come here often. Never have had a bad meal. If they have mango sticky rice for dessert, get it."}
{"text":"I didn't eat anything here. The challenge, then, is writing a fair review without actually eating the food...  Well, I'm always up for a challenge.  Came here around noon with a bunch of tired friends in a good mood (yeah, we just had a test in the morning). We asked to be seated in the patio area, and they obliged. The decor indoors, by the way, seemed pretty nice. Kinda understated wooden interior with \"Asian\" decorations, employees dressed in seemingly traditional Thai wear (I'm not Thai, so don't ask), and somewhat quiet atmosphere, actually... no music that I can remember.  Outside was pretty awesome though. It was like a garden combined with an outdoor cafe, with quite a decent amount of plants, tablecushioned metal seats, and a surprisingly quite atmosphere for being in what's essentially a strip mall off Eastern. I imagine those lights would've been nice at night, although those fans are probably of limited use in the desert summer...  Service was fast and efficient. We didn't have to wait more than a few minutes to place orders, which was a pleasant contrast to my recent experiences at some other restaurants. After maybe 5 minutes, they brought out the soups, and 10 or 15 minutes later they had the main orders ready. Not bad for a table of 8 (not counting the weirdo sitting around without food). It seemed like everybody was enjoying their food (or maybe they were just tired) from the limited conversation that took place after the food arrived, although nobody ventured that the food was spectacular. Then again, they didn't say that it sucked, so that's a good sign.  I glanced at someone's receipt and the bill was about $10 for one of the lunch menu items (before tip I think), which seems reasonable for a quality sit-down place. That lunch menu, by the way ,is pretty handy: pick one of the standard dishes such as pad thai or curry, customize with choice of meat and I think a side (I didn't pay attention since I wasn't ordering), and enjoy. I'd certainly like to try the food some time, and it might've been today if I hadn't made plans with a friend to get me somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service sucks! It took literally 15 min to take my order then she didn't get order right so we said never mind!  Then they slow don't refill water in a timely matter! There's a lot of ladies just standing like seriously!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai restaurant in las vegas. The food is always consistent and the service is great. I love the yellow curry here, the perfect blend of spice and sweet from the cocnut milk. The sauce is a little thicker almost to gravy status and not super runny like other places I have tried. The pineapple fried rice is another great dish. The combination of sweet from the pineapple along with the peanuts, shrimp and rice is amazing. Come check this place out and I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I do like the food here but don't like the pricing.  I do feel it is a little pricy but we're probably paying for the decor the traditional uniform the staff wears.  I would give this place a 5th star if the prices were a little more decent.  Either way, a great place for your Thai food cravings!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here once before, and it was alright, not the best, but it was good enough to have me believing I should order for delivery.... Note to self: don't order for delivery.  After ten impatient minutes of being on hold multiple times, I ordered Pad Thai and Rad Na. They said it'll take an hour. AN HOUR. Ridiculous waiting time.  My food finally arrived within the expected delivery time. Pad Thai is my absolute favorite Thai dish, and you can never go wrong with it, but they managed to do so. It was completely dry and lacked flavor. They didnt even throw in a complimentary lime for my noodles (i love lime). My starving self couldn't even finish a third of my entr√©e before I threw it out. My boyfriend had the Rad Na, his favorite, which wasn't necessarily great either. Rad Na is listed under the noodles section of the menu, which its supposed to be a noodle dish made with vegetables and gravy. But what we got was a dish of gravy with very, very little noodle. I mean, we didn't order a soup dish, so I'd expect a lot more noodles for my noodle entr√©e.  Those two displeasing dishes were not worth over 20 dollars, and it was definitely not worth 2 stars, but if I hadn't had a better previous dining experience here, it would've been just one star.    Once again, don't do delivery!!"}
{"text":"Food: FAN-F*CKING-TASTIC!!! Service: AH-maxing! Location: Perfect.  As per the suggestion of many, many friends I finally tried this place. And because I live around the corner. It's a little spendy, but totally worth it. We got the pad Thai and the pork fried rice. No the dishes were cooked to perfection and there were left overs. Told the hubbster we need to go in and sit down to eat, as the atmosphere was lovely. I will be coming here on a very regular basis. Can't wait to try the duck curry next!!"}
{"text":"Seriously poor service, food was cold, never got refills on drinks yet the waiter was chatting up other tables -not happy at all!"}
{"text":"I placed a takeout order over the phone consisting of one entree and one drink. Doesn't get any simpler.  I went inside to verify order & pay. That's when I realized whoever answered my call submitted incorrect drink order. Believe it or not, the manager was passively argumentative over what she believes was the \"correct drink.\"   I should have left the restaurant right then and there.   I ordered Thai Iced Coffee ($3) not the tea. For a brief moment, Sue was \"acting\" professional and corrected drink order. Bus boy hands me the drink in a to-go cup and I asked him (twice) before accepting it, if it was coffee and he said yes. I go to my car and realized its the wrong drink. *smh*  I had to walk back inside and explain the wrong drink issue and Sue (Manager) gives attitude/displays unprofessional facial demeanor and starts to debate with me (again) over a DRINK. I left and will never return."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good atmosphere, and a respectable level of spice.  I had the Hell Curry on a whim and tried the Duck Basil. Both were very good, although I would personally go for my old standby of green or red curry if I return to the area."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow is located in the shopping center and is decorated nicely on the interior. The lunch special was very limited so I opted for a'la carte chicken yellow curry.   The dish seemed large but it contained lots of sauce, marginal amounts of white meat chicken and potatoes with a yellow coconut curry sauce. It tasted good with the exception of the $9.00 price I would think their portions would be larger for the high price.   Another item that urked me was that I ordered hot tea and received my billd they charged me .50 higher then the menu said. I brought this up to the waitress and she said she would mention it to the owner. On top of that they charge a $15.00 minimum on credit cards so I had to pay cash.  The waitress didn't brother bringing my change back so I walked out - her tip was the change she didn't return.  I'd recommending sticking to the lunch specials because your paying for the decor here - overpriced and small portions, at least for the Chicken Curry."}
{"text":"The BF loves this place but I think Ping Pong is better... So with that said it was the BF's B-Day so like I knew he would he chose to have his B-Day lunch at this Pin Kaow. This Pin Kaow is right near my house and very clean inside and you know what they say \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness\" Two things I appreciate here is that it is clean and decorated so cool. As you walk in you are greeted with a wooden sign that says \"Welcome to Thailand\" and the ambiance does feel like we have gone on a trip...  OK on to the food- Today we had:   - Green Curry with Chicken- Pretty good, white meat, and I love the thin bamboo shoots -Tom Yum Soup- I think this soup is stinky so I am honestly turned off by it and it was no different here however I must say I really do enjoy it at Ping Pong ( it does not stink there and they also put mushrooms in the soup) -Beef Pad See Ew- The beef was tough - the beef should be soft-but still this dish was acceptable -Veggie Spring Rolls- It's OK, but I think it could use more flavor and the dipping sauce they provide is too sweet like a melted lollipop -Wonton Soup - No flavor but wontons were plump and filled All in all I am not impressed by this place at all but the BF loves it!!! It is close to home and OK in my book so I guess we will be back but only if going to Ping Pong is not attainable....."}
{"text":"I love food perhaps more than I should. If I am not eating then I am dreaming of food. I find it to be hypnotic. But there are few foods that have the affect on me that Thai red curry chicken has. It is has a soothing affect on me that I can't quite explain. If I even so much as walk by a place serving curry I am drawn in by the intoxicating aroma. It is as if a ghostly hand is beckoning me like a cartoon bear. It may just be my favorite food. And the red curry chicken from Pin Kaow is no exception. It was sweet and creamy with tender chicken, sliced bamboo, red bell pepper, and fresh basil. Served on some white rice and I am set. I ordered the spring rolls to get me started. They were fresh and hot burning my hands and mouth. Pure crispy deliciousness.  The service was good too. The staff is courteous even bringing me extra rice when I asked for my remaining curry to go. The decor is pleasing as well. Dark wood paneling, Thai art and tapestries, and Thai music all add to the ambience. I can't believe I have passed by it so many times when I live so close. This is a place I will be back to hopefully in the near future."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! We came on a Tuesday around 1pm, they were not busy. We got sat right down. Our server was there to take drink orders right away. I love the ambiance! The staff all dressed in Thai clothing. Very cute and inviting! They offer a great lunch special! Which I got. Pad Thai (#3 spicy level), came with; egg soup, side salad (you could also choose from egg rolls, fried rice, white rice, or soup). You also not only have choices of meat, but any meat meal can be subbed for tofu, which is what I got. The food was to die for!!!!! The soup was hot and perfect! The salad dressing was on point and my pad Thai.... Perfection! I believe the lunch special was $8.95, not bad especially since I took half home for dinner! Will definitely come back! Excited to explore more of that menu!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Thai restaurant in town! Nobody else's pad thai compares! And everything else is just as delicious, I love it all. Will always keep going back!"}
{"text":"I ordered carryout from this location last night.  I was craving pad thai and could not find the boxed kind you make yourself at Fresh and Easy since they are remodeling.  The reviews here made me decide to try this place.  This was my first experience with Thai food in Las Vegas.  The service was great- very nice girls answering the phone, fulfilling orders (mine was exact,) and greeting you at the door.  My order was ready exactly at the time promised.  I ordered a Thai iced coffee which was great, shrimp roll appetizer and a medium-spicy Pad Thai with shrimp.  My total was $28 without gratuity I included.  The shrimp rolls were very good and I thought I got a very good portion with the price I paid.  I wished the orange sauce was not so watery though because every time I dipped the shrimps in the sauce the sauce did not stick.  My pad thai was okay.  It seemed like the shrimp had been overcooked and like the pad thai had been sitting for a long time.  The noodles were thinner then what I am used too; the noodles taste the same but I still enjoy them thicker.  This pad thai killed my craving but it wasn't that good of pad thai to be honest.  I probably won't order from here again but the service was really good!  I'm sure there are more uniquely Thai dishes I could have ordered from here that maybe would be better but I'm really only into pad thai."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had the lunch special.   I don't understand why they serve the main dish with chinese fried rice and egg roll in a thai restaurant.   The soup was watered down. With no real fun in it.  The pad thai was boring, with no flavor and not spicy at a 9/10.   The service was good. The decor was good. It was busy when we went (lunch hour). The thai tea was good."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place on the inside vs. The outside and location. If u r going for lunch its a little cold inside bring a sweater and its loud from all the other people inside so if u r looking for a quiet place this is not for u. The food is good and service is ok. We could have had our wait staff person come to our table for drink refills or to check on us. Its a little dark inside as well  All in all its a good place."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant is consistently the best Thai food, whether it's a quick lunch or a nice dinner! Great food full of flavor, good service, and affordable prices guarantees a five star experience."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai spot on my side of town. They try their best to accommodate gluten free customers, and my friends and family have said their other dishes were good as well. The portions are big, but not feast size, so I usually share when I'm mildly hungry but could eat the whole thing if I were starving. The interior is dimly lit and very ornate. You can come casual, but I'd go for a nicer casual. The wait isn't that long for the food, and the staff is nice. You also get to chose the spicy level between 1-10. I usually go for a 5 and it's not too bad (:"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant now for 7 years . This is the first review. It's really a 4 star restaurant that I will give 5 stars because .... I don't like being that guy.   I thought their green tea was okay.  I was expecting a more of a traditional presentation lol. . :) Instead I got tea bagged with a mug.  lol   But food was fantastic. Next time I'm getting Thai tea!!"}
{"text":"This was an absolute surprise. Food was fresh and delicious. However it was the service that made it outstanding. Our server Pajama was excellent. Took the time to explain the menu. It's a little more expensive then Archie's but well worth it."}
{"text":"After a rather boisterous night from my 20mth old nephew & barely getting through our soup (which was divine, i'll get back to that shortly) we had everything packed up to-go.   Rewind to the beginning of the night after making our selections, our soup Tom - Ka - Koong was first on the table.   A rich blend of lemon grass soup, coconut & galanga root, light on the palate, explosive in taste. Although the mushroom & shrimp were more of an after thought in the soup, it doesn't stop you from appreciating this elixir of yum! If anything I'd like to have the soup bottled to go & drink it like water!  As our entrees trickled in, the Thai BBQ chicken in first, followed by Black Bean Scallop...  My jaw-dropped in epic disappointment as I gazed at the dish, which was poorly plated not a single sense of appeal to it, like cheap chopsuey. For $15 you'd expect to see some effort into it...  Fast forward we continued dinner at home with a bottle merlot to boot. The house wasn't that far so our dishes were still fairly warm. As we sunk our teeth into what seemed like Thai BBQ chicken jerky. The meat was dry of epic proportions! Wherein we forced it down with the merlot. Taste-wise it seems all of it had dissipated.  Black bean scallops...not even a hint of black bean sauce, it just tasted like cheap chopsuey. The scallops were cooked well, soft & melts in your mouth. Poorly executed dish."}
{"text":"I've always loved Pin Kaow and now that there is one close to me it makes it my favorite Thai place on this side of town.  I ordered to go and the whole process was effortless. It was so easy and picking it up was just as easy. I think they have a pretty good system figured out here.   As for the food, I ordered my usual favorite, Beef Pad See Ew (I'm a lover of chow fun). It was nice that it was ready when they said it was ready and they automatically give you a side of the jalapeno vinegar sauce without asking! I asked for not too spicy and this place definitely follows the not too spicy level. Thank goodness! Overall, food was delicious as usual and even better with the jalapeno sauce.   Pin Kaow has definitely won me over and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The service here is ! They are helpful when answering questions & the food is amazing! The portions are a large size & I would recommend sharing! The restaurant is nice, and great for date night or just to meet friends! I will definitely be coming back here! They offer patio seating & a full bar! A wonderful experience overall!"}
{"text":"This is our everyday Thai place since it's in Summerlin near where we live. We tend to do takeout most of the time and always order the wontons (an appetizer), the minced chicken dish and the chicken larb. The Chinese wontons are a strange order for us at a Thai place, but they're some of the best I've had. Really weird. Really yummy. The minced chicken and anything they do in this fashion I find to be good. Not the best, but good. Flavor won't blow you away but prices are normal. The spice level is honestly too mild for me, but I love it spicy. I get Thai hot.   I love the large portions. Ambiance and decor are nice. Cozy and cute for a date night."}
{"text":"First visit here. We ordered our food to go. Asked for suggestions, recommended meal was tasty. Also had Satay with Chicken. The food was good. I order a 2 and it had very little spice. Salmon Green Curry at a 2 was spicy.  I think dining in would be better. Will return to dine in."}
{"text":"I have been here many times because their food is delicious. I love their Pad See Ew, their coconut soup, their curry, and I their beef salad. Their service has always been great, but for some reason today it was different. We came in and sat down at 2:50pm. Five minutes after we ordered, the lady came back and said it was last call. When our food came out, we asked what she meant and they told us that they closed from 3pm-5pm, but that it was only the kitchen and that we could still eat. Not even 15 minutes later, we were asked if we wanted boxes. We didn't sit for even an hour and were approached 5 different times, making us feel rushed to leave. The last straw was when a lady dressed in shorts with her purse across her chest (we didn't even know she worked here), came over and said, \"You know we close at 3!\" When the manager came over, we explained how we didn't know they closed and we didn't appreciate being rushed. All she responded was, \"I'm sorry.\" Had they informed us before we sat and ordered that they were closing and we had a time limit, we would have left and gone somewhere else. We were looking to enjoy a nice lunch with friends and conversation."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials and the busy crowd during the work week proves it!  (The owners opened up a second location so that tells you something.) My boss and I went there many times for lunch when the mortgage office was just around the corner (so convenient). The entire costumed staff (in very ornate and eye popping colors BTW, so pretty) is very nice and take care of you right away (the growing line permitting of course). Seating is both booths and tables. The furniture, decor and ambiance is very pretty- carved dark rich woods. Although it is a busy place, you are not ignored here and every customer is just as important. Single bathrooms behind the beaded curtain might have you waiting in the hall but hopefully the wait is not too long.  The lunch special is a good size: tasty soup, a spring roll, a fried wonton with the dipping sauces, the entree (many choices- but my favorites were curry chicken, pad thai, & thai beef salad), and a bowl of white rice. And you could customize spiciness too- I like medium to spicy. I don't think I was ever disappointed here- never had an off meal. Two people could eat here for less than $20.00 including the tip- during the work week.    I introduced my husband to this thai restaurant and he liked it a lot. We're not in the general area a whole lot since my work place has changed (including the boss), nor is this restaurant close to our home, either. If we were in the area, I would love to eat here again."}
{"text":"I have not been here in a long time but it is really full. Venue is clean. if you want to get a feel of Thailand, you should go here. waiters wearing authentic Thai uniforms, serive is great, manager goes to each table and ask if everything is goo- Wow! talk about taking care of you! Food is great, very authentic! a great place to do family sharing. ample parking!"}
{"text":"The portions at Pinkaow have definitely gotten smaller.   The pineapple fried rice was disappointing. The rice was dry and the shrimp was flavorless. The pad thai was good, 2/10 on the spicy scale was perfect for me. The chicken cashew was also dry and completely unmemorable.   I've had way better thai food in Vegas. Bye Pinkaow :("}
{"text":"lunch special for under $9?! I'm in.  They make their food FAST. Have an hour lunch break and need to be in and out? Pin Kaow gets crowded, but the service never slows down.  Lunch special comes with a spring roll (sadly NOT an egg roll), a fried triangle thing, soup and your entree. Pad thai is large enough that I could take some leftovers home.  Spicy level 2 isn't spicy at all. I prefer the 2 rather than tasteless 1, even though I'm a weakling when it comes to spices."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for some yummy War Won ton soup. I wish they had more steamed/baked options. All the fried food is hard on my tummy. I have a friend date with my bestie for soup here after the gym. Service is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent traveler around the world. Spent a lot of time in Thailand... This place is NOT authentic.  I got red curry. Asked for Thai hot and and an egg roll on the side.   I got an American 2 for heat and a salad.  Ok. So that's not so bad. But they are using pretty booked/microwaved/frozen chicken to add to their curry...  Well, most people don't have the tongue to know the difference, but after many years of cooking many dishes I learned around the world, I couldn't let this slide. The curry actually was good but not spicy, but the chicken ruined the meal.   If in Vegas check out Thai House in Henderson. Small family owned place with owners and family cooking for you. All fresh, all amazing.  This place.. is made for people that really don't know Thai food."}
{"text":"I have eat at this Pin Kaow several times and have never had any problems.  Last night we got take out and we not very happy, the food was good as usual but the portions for their take out were small and we asked for a little extra steamed rice and they wanted to charge us $5 for the medium container.  If we were eating there it would have been free.  Not real happy since we recommended it to friends and then had to hear about the price all night long :-("}
{"text":"I have been a customer for years and I feel like this location is headed downhill.  Went for lunch and the lunch special has jumped to $9.  Not so special.  My friend's chicken dish only had two pieces of chicken.  My meal was late - with tables who were seated after our table being served before me.   I asked the waitress, who was nice, but she just kept smiling but did not help much.  I will give it another try in a few months - maybe it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"Started eating here 9 years ago and we are never disappointed. We had dinner Friday night and the manager/owner was so friendly and sent us a free Desert just because he's nice  Thank you again"}
{"text":"I tried this place in the Henderson location which was pretty good so I decided to try it in this location which is close to me. The service was very slow! It took them 20 minutes just to take our order. The food portions was small. We ordered my favorite Panang Chicken Curry, they were very cheap on then chicken. Maybe 3-4 pieces. The Pad Ke Mow portion was small. Food was good but very small portions. Other places I been to such as Archies.. Lets just say you cant finish and need to take it to go while in this place took us 5 min to devour. I wouldnt come here. Back to Archies I go."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. I went with my family of four. We ordered a hot green tea, ONE sprite, one water, and a Thai iced tea. The waiter brings out an additional sprite along with the three drinks we ordered. We informed him of the mishap and he becomes so confused and says that we already ordered it so he can't go back and change in the order...we tell him we only ordered ONE sprite and THEN he says he will take that out of the order with the manager. If he can change it, why would he say he couldn't? It's only three bucks more but his negative attitude was very irritating and ruined a nice family dinner. My sister and I caught him throwing us a couple of dirty looks when he thought we weren't paying attention. He also tried taking away the dishes while we were still eating, without even asking if we were finished. Not only is the service terrible, the quality of the food has gone down. We always get beef noodle soup and the taste of it today was very different from before. In conclusion, I still tipped the guy but my family and I are never going there again."}
{"text":"The coconut salt scrub that they provide in their bathrooms is amazing! Seriously, ladies head to the restroom and try it out. It will leave your hands silky, soft and smooth. We especially appreciated it on our hands after having rock climbed all day. Unfortunately, the scrub is not available in the men's restroom, which is a shame, because I think the guys would appreciate it as much as the ladies.   The restaurant features lots of  beautifully carved wood, which creates a serene environment. You are served by beautiful authentically attired Thai servers. Their costumes are gorgeous. The food is delicious, typical Thai fare. No complaints here! If you are looking for a cute Thai spot for a date place this is the place to come. If you are looking for Thai food in a beautiful relaxing environment this is also the place to come."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their green curry! I highly highly recommend it.  I get it to go at times, twice a week.  There's never a long wait.  My food is ready every time I go in.  The staff is very kind & gracious.  This Thai place has to only be second to Lotus of Siam in all of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and very relaxing and inviting atmosphere, there is no wonder why this place is a locals favorite. This visit I we had the Beef Jerkey, Tom Yum Goong soup, Pad Thai and Duck Salad. Every dish had wonderful flavors and even the dish we ordered at a hot level 9 wasn't too spicy.  Best dish of the night though was the Beef Jerkey, definitly a must try. Decor of the restaurant was cute and very Thai. Everything was clean and neat and the wait staff were all very friendly, helpful and efficient.  If you like Thia food or want to give it a try this place is a must."}
{"text":"I love the cream cheese tempura and pumpkin curry.   Oh yes!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in town. I love their thai basil beef, fried rice and thai bbq chicken. The thai tea is always refreshing and delicious. The lunch specials are a great price and lots of food!"}
{"text":"A little over priced but food is amazing. Delivery is always fast and friendly. I eat there about once a week."}
{"text":"I have been ordering food from them to go on numbers of occasions.  I love their Fried Rice and Pad Thai... The BEST in the town... however, I hate their TO GO service counter as the woman there is very mean.... She will not talk to you, not look at you, not greet you if she is processing payment... She will just say \"Sir, I am busy, just wait a  minute OK\"  NOT NICE... I have told her couple of times that there is a better way to say it... But Oh well!  Good environment, other staff and food is awesome..."}
{"text":"Excellent thai restaurant I always like to go. The food is amazing. Warm atmosphere. Beautiful woody design and right price. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Solid Thai food. Everything comes out quickly and fresh. There is also good service.   There are three levels of spice: mild, medium and spicy.  Would recommend noodles and rice dishes"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time.  All dishes were spicy 6 and next time I will go higher.   Beef salad very good. The dressing was perfect.    Beef with snowpeas was amazing. So flavorful.   Chili mint noodles were also very good.   My only complaint is the portions were a little small but I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Good and tasty authentic Thai cuisine. I can definitely eat here again. Price is fair and an entree is good for 2 people."}
{"text":"I could recommend this place if you are craving Thai food. Pad Thai was good. Lets just say this place is way better than Archies."}
{"text":"Awesome, that about sums it up.      Beware though, I would just have them do the bare minium spice level 1 if you are with a group.   They have the hot sauce rack and you can add your own.   I like is spicy and their food is indeed spicy.   Chicken with yellow curry, was probably one of the best I've had.    Shrimp covered with cream cheese, breaded and fried.   How can you go wrong?  Super good.  All the soups were good, our whole table enjoyed the won ton, lemon grass and coconut soup.     Drink suggestion:  Dragon berry mojito    Everyone we went with has loved this place and we will be going back for more."}
{"text":"BEST THAI IN TOWN. Pad Thai is fantastic, yellow curry is fantastic, everything is just great. Staff is super friendly too. Definitely my go to restaurant."}
{"text":"I placed an order online for chicken pad thai with no spice. A minute later, I got a call to confirm my order and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. Although you have the option to pay online, I decided to pay at the restaurant when I picked up my order. The pad thai was okay but I wish there was more sauce because it wouldve tasted better with more flavor. I love the fact that they added a lot of bean sprouts on the side and crushed peanuts, as some places do not."}
{"text":"I know what I 'want' to order but variety pops up. Ordered the Crispy Crab appetizer and thinking about the Fried Banana w Ice Cream for dessert before I have a glance to order my traditional Thai Salad and Yellow Curry. Also Thai Tea is a must everywhere I go."}
{"text":"First off I'm reviewing their lunch specials because this location I eat when I'm craving Thai food during my lunch break. (I usually go to Pin Kaow 2 which is closer to my house SEE THAT REVIEW FOR MORE)  The atmosphere here is very pleasant, dim lighting and authentic decor down to the servers. The service here is amazing, the servers are sweet and very attentive. So back to lunch, 7.95 for your choice of either pork, beef, chicken, or tofu or 8.95 for shrimp or squid. I love their lunch specials because for 7.95 (dine in) you get to choose from the top 10 most ordered dishes that come with a side of rice, daily soup, egg rolls, & fried wontons. ALL THAT for $7.95 what a great deal! I absolutely love Pin kaows chain of restaurants. They have 3 locations in Las Vegas which makes it so convenient for people to come on in and try their food! I'm Thai and this place hits pretty close to moms home cooking."}
{"text":"The best Thai I've ever had.   Simply unbelievable great food.  Love every dish we had.  The cream cheese stuffed shrimp appetizer are amazing.   We had several dishes to share and were just loving it all.  The atmosphere is quaint and the staff friendly.  Will return."}
{"text":"Always good, Tom - Yum - Koong soup is fantastic! Service is always awesome. Happy they have added more tables.  We never get enough of the red curry. I have them on speed dial in the car so I can pick it up while I'm out shopping and wala it ready when I get there!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Pin Kaow for a few years and it's good every time. The staff is nice and courteous, the food is excellent (to the point that I compare all other Thai places to them). My co-workers and I celebrate 95% of our birthday lunches here and at least 2 of us turn to Pin Kaow for Friday night dinners. I brought all my friends and family here when they visited and I am pretty sure I made a few of them become beef panang fans. A big plus is that it doesn't look / feel like a hole in the wall and the cleanliness is obvious."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas...  The lemon grass trout is amazing...  Along with the Crab Fried Rice."}
{"text":"Always love coming here. The food is great. Vegetarian options too. The spices and sauces are amazing, and the ambiance of carved wood makes you feel like you're in s Thai palace. Must try"}
{"text":"I'm new to this area of town so I haven't found a great Thai restaurant yet.   Pin Kaow Thai has good amount of Stars so I went there to order take-out without reading reviews first.     I ordered Pad Thai for myself and Pad See Ew for my friend. We also order spring rolls to split.  We both order 4/10 stars.   I found both entrees to be bland.  I ordered low stars b/c I didn't want the food to be too spicy but I wanted it to have flavor.  My friend agreed with my assessment.  We say edible but not great."}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai in Vegas. Recommend the pad se ew, basil chicken, Thai tea ice cream."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I've been coming to this restaurant for years, but I've noticed that their service has been declining.  Server forgets about order and the water is never refilled.  The staff members seemed annoyed and bothered when I ask for anything. There are so many outstanding restaurant in Las Vegas, therefore, you expect good service.  I hope they get better service otherwise, my family and I won't be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday with a couple friends that were visiting from out of town. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and the food was very good.    We were rather full from lunch so we split two different entrees among the four of us and we have plenty to eat. The food was well prepared and quite tasty.   Our waiter (Chris) was knowledgeable and very pleasant to talk with and he was quite witty which made us feel comfortable and it a light hearted mood. Overall it was a good evening.  We will definitely go back and ask for Chris again."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. This is probably my second favorite Thai place in town. The staff is nice and the atmosphere is nicer than you'd expect. I usually get one of their curries. My wife gets the pad thai. Nothing mind-blowing, but solid Thai."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places to go to! The green curry is my favorite and the levels you get are pretty accurate I think a 4 is just right! The receptionist that is there is super sweet and fast. I think the prices are reasonable for some delicious food."}
{"text":"This really hurts my heart to be writing a review like this because Pin Kaow WAS my favorite restaurant but unfortunately I don't think that we will be returning anymore.  We have been going to Pin Kaow every week religiously for the past 9 years. We were going there when it was just the one restaurant on North Rainbow Blvd.The service was always great and the food was even better, the kicker though, was the prices, they couldn't be beat. This is what truly set them apart from all the other Thai places. Unfortunately, I feel like  they have become more \"corporate\" like these days.As time went on I watched the prices go up multiple times and watched the portions get smaller and smaller. They even got rid of their cute little uniforms that they had which was such a nice added touch to the experience. But we still stood by them as we were always a loyal customer.  For the past year my co workers and I have been going to the one on Eastern every week on our lunch hour.   Last week as always, we went in and ordered our chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice lunch special. 30 minutes later we got our food, at this time we placed an order for another shrimp fried rice lunch special to go. It took 45 minutes for us to receive the food. Keep in mind they only had 3 other tables in the restaurant filled at this time.  We had to ask them TWICE about the to go order in which 30 minutes later the waitress comes up to the table to tell us that the order had been placed. EXCUSE ME?! 30 minutes and 2 times checking and the order was JUST placed? The only response that we get is a shrug of the shoulder with a smug sorry to go along with it, as if we did something wrong. Needless to say, we were over 30 minutes late getting back to the office as we only have 1 hour for our lunch break.  TODAY, we decided to give them another shot as mistakes and bad days do happen. Well it just about felt like groundhog day because here we go again.  We place our order of Crab Rangoon, and 3 lunch specials with another order of the Chicken fried rice lunch special to go. 15 minutes later we were eating our Crab Rangoon with our soup that went with the lunch special that followed. The only problem was......our lunch specials never came. 45 minutes later and with our lunch break being over we got up to ask them what was going on with our food, as we were watching the other tables that had arrived 25 minutes after us enjoy their lunch. The lady at the front said that she would check and then she never reported back to us.  10 minutes later we checked on it again and they simply just handed us the bill with no explanation and no food. We tell her to pack up our orders as there is no possible way for us to be able to sit and eat as we are already late.   We get back to the office, keep in mind that we are now trying to have a bite here and there in between our patients and our food was not even sub par...... NOT AT ALL. It tasted like it had been sitting there for hours, my shrimp in the fried rice was dried out the pad thai had no flavor and the chicken fried rice was floating in grease. It was pretty much inedible. Needless to say we all ended up throwing our food out.   My co worker then called the restaurant to complain and was basically given the cold shoulder. They again were acting as if WE did something wrong. We were told to bring the food back to the restaurant (because we all have time in the world to run around town bringing food back and fourth during our work day after already being late to work because they couldn't get their act together).  We told them that we couldn't do that,  after hearing all the  himing and hawing and being put on hold multiple times she told us that when we came back they would give us 15% off of our next bill. REALLY?!? We wasted our hour long lunch, gas money and our money on food that we ended up throwing out and you are giving us attitude as you offer us 15%.   REALLY? PLEASE!!! AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT!!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time with my girlfriend and we can't say enough about this place! Amazing decor, service, and cuisine! She loves the Thai ice tea and veggie pad Thai and I always get the chicken pad Thai or duck basil. Amazing quality and variety."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, nice atmosphere, beautiful wood work through out the restaurant, and love how everything around was very clean and organized. The service was good and professional, except I had to request the spices 2 times.  I ordered the shrimp/mushroom soup w/ steam rice (wished they would use the traditional straw mushrooms) and the pad thai rice noodles w/ chicken level 5 mild spicy (end up not being spicy at all).  Over all it was a good experience. Best I've had in Las Vegas. I do recommend eating here. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent. The staff is very attentive good with the beverage refills. I ordered the combo Fried rice and my companion had Pad Thai and the green salad. We also shared an order of Spring rolls. Everything tasted freshly prepared and flavorful. I had hot green tea and she had an alcoholic drink that she raved about. So of course she had two. A very good dining experience."}
{"text":"Visiting family for Thanksgiving always means adventure in dining.  First and foremost, when someone gives you directions, do your own mapquest before going.  The way to the restaurant was not very clear from my sister in law and I got lost.  We had driven all day from SD to Las Vegas and was really hungry enough.    So we went and ate at Pin Kaow since my family in Vegas have eaten there before.  We arrived late and they have already ordered some appetizers and soup.  Tom Yum, crab rangoon, and fried tofu.  We had to make sure that Tom Yum was based with vegetable broth since my partner Brian was only vegetarian and seafood, no red or white meat (pork/chicken).  Tom Yum was spicy (5). crab rangoon and fried tofu was great but not enough sweet and sour sauce with the appetizers.    Then for the good stuff, my sister gets a little dominant during this dinner and said why don't we just order appetizers, which we didn't follow anyway (she got married 10+ years ago and she still talks about the wedding reception - at a tapas restaurant).   Other orders were crab fried rice, plain egg only fried rice, combo fried rice, bbq ribs, scallops and larb (beef).  All was great.  The crab fried rice was great.  The ribs was tasty and the larb was wonderful.  Service was great although they did refill your drinks but was too fast to ask what it was.  Recommended place for Thai food.  Happy hour has good priced drinks and half priced appetizers, check with the restaurant for times"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The place is always busy (a good sign) and the service is decent. The only thing preventing me from a 5 star review is the service wasn't great-only decent."}
{"text":"The food here is good, the one star is for the service and the fact that the workers here just don't care.  This place is never a choice of mine to go to, I end up here because people I am with want to go here.  First off if you ever order food to go make sure you check your order before you leave because they will always screw it up.  Every time I have been here and got spring rolls to go, every person I have ever asked to please make sure they put some sauce in there, they don't,,,,,WHY????  Can someone please explain WHY they just flat out ignore you???  This is their job and they are not good at it.     Like I said, the food is good but the service and attention to what the customers want is very very poor.  The service here has always been poor but unfortunately they get a lot of business and they never read these reviews so they don't care.  It's sad, but fortunately there are other Thai places in close proximity with excellent food and service.    I don't like giving places one star but this place is just way too consistent at poor service.  I've never been here and had a good service experience.  The food, YES, it's good, the service NO, it's bad."}
{"text":"The interior d√©cor was lovely and the food was fine; however, the experience was hampered by an absent, dour waitress, and small portions that didn't justify the prices. The wor wonton soup was good with an unexpected flavor of garlic but the portion was hardly enough for 5 full-grown adults. I have to admit though the pot with the flame under was fanciful. The lukewarm pad thai, duck fried rice, and scallops were passable but why weren't they served hotter? Above all, the spicy basil with ground beef was the clear favorite; except for my mom, who passively said it was really spicy and drank all her water quickly. The dish was oily but I used the white rice to sop up the flavor, which yielded great results.   Our waitress didn't refill our drinks until she sent someone else (she was far more jovial) to do her job. While I admire the gorgeous ambiance, overall Pinkaow fell flat."}
{"text":"So Thai food is slightly adventurous for my taste. So we started the meal with a bottle of white wine which was great. Then we had three appetizers the crab Rangoon the chicken satay and deep-fried shrimp with cream cheese. They were all very good. Then we all decided to share the pad Thai with shrimp and a wonderful soup with lemongrass and coconut.  Then we had a fantastic grilled pineapple with coconut ice cream and a butter rum sauce that was really the star.  Great service too. I would go back even though I'm not the biggest fan of Thai I thought the food was good."}
{"text":"Ok so I have lived in the Northwest for 10 years, drove by this place a thousand times, always just assumed it was not good because of the older location and plain outside decor, and was dedicated to my Weera Thai. Now I will ONLY go here after my friend took me here a few months ago! I have already been 5 times in the last 2 months and just celebrated my birthday there. Not only was the food stellar but was serenaded \"Happy Birthday\" and \"Love me Tender\" haha by the WONDERFUL new manager Toy. Everytime I have been there he walks around making sure everyone is enjoying their meal. He is always happy, smiling, and truly LOVES his job. It is awesome to see such pride in the restaurant and concern for his customers. The food is ALWAYS so damn good!! Flavorful and fresh. My faves are definitely the crab rangoon, garlic tofu, pad thai, pad see ewe, and I swear I cannot figure out if they buy it or make it but the coconut ice cream is THE BEST I have ever had! Real shreds of coconut and even got a free scoop with a candle and a cherry on my bday! The ONLY reason I am taking off one star is because I feel like the portion size is sometimes a little inconsistent. I feel like the portion sizes are always larger for lunch than dinner. Regardless, this is my new thai place..sorry weera :( I'm sorry I didn't try this place much much sooner!!"}
{"text":"Oh how did I forget to review this place after all  these years?  I've been getting pork pad thai and chicken satay without fail. Today the wife ordered wor won soup and I had the Pin Kaow basil shrimp 6/10 spice.   To DIE for. The soup was delicious and the huge tempura shrimp with basil sauce was amazing."}
{"text":"Been to a lot of Thai restaurant in Vegas and Utah but Pin Kaow is absolutely the best Thai food restaurant of them all! awesome food and flavor luv the green curry, my fav....I will be a regular in this establishment! (1st time review)  2nd visit....me and my wife went here again, sure the food was delicious but you insulted me and my wife running at and chasing us at the parking lot saying that we didn't pay it was absolutely embarrasing! well the credit card receipt showed my wife's signature on it and pointed at it, make sure to pay attention to detail next time and avoid embarrasing your costumer. Oh btw I found a much better Thai restaurant - Kung Fu Thai & Chinese at Chinatown!!!"}
{"text":"My kids love Pin Kaow. It's always our go to if we don't know what to cook for dinner at home."}
{"text":"Well I finally returned unexpectedly today after a long while since my last meal here.  I turned into the parking lot then went for the spicy eggplant and tofu with basil.  The good thing is the option of fried or steamed tofu.  I went for steamed.  The dish had jalepenos, red bell pepper, basil, really delicious eggplant and steamed tofu with a side of white rice.  I also got suckered into the specials menu.  I ordered a soft shell crab-apple salad.  It sounds weird, but it was sooooo good.  A crisp soft shell crab cut in half atop julienned apples, thai chilis, green onions, red onion, cabbage, carrot, and garlic with a lime dressing.  It was spiiiicy!  I got a 5 on the salad and a 7 on the eggplant dish, but Blair B. would not be surprised when I say the salad was spicier than the hot dish :)  Topped off the meal with a Thai iced tea (those are $3 now holy moly!) and ended up with plenty for tomorrow's lunch.  So far, I am still interested in coming back for more."}
{"text":"Good food fast service. A little bit expensive over all. Every time I have been there the place has been packed. Possibly the best Thai place by my house."}
{"text":"Like many restaurants it comes down to what you order. Took the advice of another yelper and got chicken pad see ew. Great flavor and awesome dish. Only problem was ordered spicy and it was not. Shrimp cakes reminded me of shrimp toast you used to get at Chinese restaurants. Rating on this restaurant is very very good"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! veggie pad tai came out quick and hot.  Titikoon the server took great care of me he's so nice! I just love this place! They don't use MSG in their food either and being pregnant that's a huge deal for me! Thanks to the chef too the food tasted amazing! Keep up the great work! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I really like the way the place looked Wouldn't know it from the outside We were greeted with a  smile from the hostess and was very friendly Our server was ok ( seemed a bit rushed )  We ordered our food and the tofu soup was pretty simple and good But when the entree arrived  ( i ordered some ginger dish with beef I thought the portions were kinda small But would have been worth it if it was good But unfortunately it was not  The first bite was cold?? I had to stir it up a bit And it was  a bit warmer but still only warm not hot  The rice and salad was good But the entree part was extremely bland It absolutely had  no seasoning or flavor My mom ordered the sweet and sour and she thought it  was delicious  and good Didn't get a check back from the server which was kind of let down : ( Would i return to this place?? I dont think i will If i do it will be a long time before i will"}
{"text":"Everyone has an opinion about good Thai food, and I think Pin Kaow is awesome.  I've yet to eat anything here that was not fantastic. Some of my favorites are the satays, Penang curry and chili mint noodles. The food is legit, but the ambiance and service are spot on too. The servers are very friendly and attentive, and even though Pin Kaow is usually busy when I've been there, I've never had to wait long for the food to arrive.   Really good for ordering dishes to share family style (if your group can agree on a spiciness level). This is the only Pin Kaow location I've tried, but I'd definitely be open to hitting up the others in the future."}
{"text":"Enjoyable meal Pad Thai and Tom Ka Soup. Remember to ask for the spice tray  to make your dish just the right amount of heat!    Staff is dressed in traditional Thai apparel and rich wood work in the walls transports you from this strip mall restaurant to the Far East.   Oranges at the end of the meal were delicious."}
{"text":"I've now been to all Pin Kaow locations. My first time was up on North Rainbow and I remember that being pretty good. Since then, I tried the South Rainbow location and I came away slightly disappointed. Fortunately, Pin Kaow 3 has reaffirmed my faith in their name.  My friends and I went here last week for a birthday lunch. We pretty much all ordered from the lunch special menu. They cost slightly more than lunch specials at other Thai restaurants, but the quality of the food helps you ignore that.  I usually go for the Panang Curry whenever it's available. However, it has been so long since I've had Pad Thai. I went with that instead. Maybe it's due to my long Pad Thai hiatus, but it was absolutely delicious. Authentic? Who knows. Yummy? Definitely.  I should also mention that the service was incredibly friendly. We had a large group and they seemed very grateful that we chose to dine at their restaurant. Great food and service. What more could you want."}
{"text":"In general their Thai food is very good. They have a fast and good service. I would recommend their Tom Yum soup or any of their curries. Each plate is between 10-12 bucks, but the quality of the food is very good! You cannot go wrong with this place!  Tip of the day: dont forget to order some thai tea!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I love it. Inside is super cute and the staff is very friendly. Food arrived quickly, was delicious and had me so stuffed I had to unbutton my pants  the lunch specials are great and come with soup of the day and egg roll or fried wonton. They have a special chef menu and drinks menu but I haven't ordered off it. The panang curry, tom yum and tom kha are also amazing."}
{"text":"Great Food!! I love the red curry as hot as they'll make it and the pad Thai is always delicious. The prices are very reasonable and I always end up with leftovers. They have awesome lunch specials and the service is always wonderful.  Great place for a date!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for Thai in Vegas. The restaurant is in a new plaza, so its a new place. The atmosphere boasts of a nice restaurant, not the usual Thai places in town. This is a place where you can entertain people from out of town because its a little on the nicer side and the food is priced reasonably. Friday night they had $5 appetizers and buy one get one Thai beer. The shrimp blankets are awesome and so are the purses. If you go here you have to get the Pineapple fried rice. Its amazing, and the presentation is great. All of the food is plated well and the dinnerware is very nice. For an entree we had eggplant chicken, yum and seafood surprise i think it was called. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since it was a little hole-in-the-wall. It's awesome. About the best Thai food in Vegas. Chicken Satay is great. Tom Ka Kai soup is wonderful. All the noodle dishes are great as are the curry entrees. The only complaint is that it's always busy and every once in awhile the service is a bit spotty. Overall, great!"}
{"text":"Pin Kaow ~ The Best Thai Food in Las Vegas!!  I am Asian, and Pin Kaow is my favorite Thai/Asian restaurant in Las Vegas!!  The food is always consistently good.  The prices of their entrees are very affordable. They have great Lunch Specials which includes, soup, appetizer, main dish & rice for less than $10.  Served from 11am -3pm.  For dinner, portions are larger and there are lots of choices.  Dinner entrees are very reasonably priced.  For great Thai food... go to Pin Kaow on Rainbow & Lake Mead.  http://www.pinkaow.com"}
{"text":"the best Thai food in town...I love the chicken green curry and pad thai.....you have got to try their chia tea and coconut  ice cream.   i have been to many Thai restaurants but this by far is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I'm convinced that Pink Kaow makes THE BEST pad see ew here in Las Vegas :) I just recently moved to summerlin area and I've came to get food here 4 times and I've only been here for a month! Soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived nearby it before and had never gone in, I had heard good things from people who's food opinions I trusted and decided that today is the day. Their lunch specials were great, something everyone could enjoy and great prices. There were no pictures of the entrees so I was a little worried but when my food arrived it was lovely, delicious pad Thai awesomeness. Everyone at our table cleaned their plates (except for me because, you know, I'm a dainty flower and large portions for me means doggie bag left overs for the boyfriend.) Their Thai tea was perfect, it made me smile and I had to use some self control instead of just chugging the whole glass. The food was authentic and fresh and  delicious and their prices make it even better. Now I know where to go when my Thai food cravings hit again. And the name of the place is fun to say..."}
{"text":"Just be sure to order it hotter because they typically run less spicy.  The food is very tasty and the portions are decent. They use powdered peppers to spice with, not fresh. We come here often."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 5/5 the most authentic interior I've ever seen for Thai restaurant. Staffs in their traditional outfit even made me smile.   Food - 2.5/5 I was really excited to go to this spot. My original destination was a different spot near the strip, but with my Uber driver's strong recommendation my friend and I decided to try out. Portion was very small, especially Thai food being one of my favorite types of food. I've been to many different Thai places. We ordered many plates between two of us. Before we saw the portion, we were 100% sure that we'd have many Togo boxes coming back to the hotel with us. But, we finished most of the food. You'd think that because the food was tasty.. NO. NO. If we weren't hungry enough, we wouldn't have even eaten the food. They were mostly very salty. Besides food being salty and a small portion, it seemed like they were using a pretty good quality of seafood and others. We had ordered, gulf of Thai, fried cream cheese, papaya salad, chicken satay, and shrimp pad see weu.  Service - 4/5 Staff here were very friendly but a bit slow on refills on drinks.   Overall, I'm sad to say my 20min drive from my hotel was just a waste of time. I'm being pretty generous on my overall 3 stars."}
{"text":"I love the pin kaow on lake mead on the west side. Been a loyal customer for over 6 years before the remodel. Decided to visit this location in Henderson and was extremely disappointed. The service is horrible. The server Beau is terribly rude and gave us attitude when we came in 20 minutes before closing. We wanted to go and he made us feel horrible after we kindly asked if it was still ok to get food on the run or if it would be an inconvenience. We've both been in the food and beverage industry and understand the etiquette when a restaurant is closing. But he made us feel unwelcomed and condescending. I usually love this company and their service is usually above par. I hope this changes because there are many competing Thai"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed with the service and unfortunately we will not return anymore.  My wife and I have been coming to Pin Kaow for years. This time around was different because we came to introduce a friend to this restaurant. As we arrived, we were told to wait 5 mins while they get our table ready for our party of 3, so we waited politely to be seated. After waiting about 10 mins, ANOTHER party of 3 walks in the door and were seated within 30 secs of their arrival! When we brought it to their attention that we have arrived first and have been waiting longer, they said they \"DIDN'T KNOW\" and were given MULTIPLE EXCUSES! We had to wait another few minutes until we were finally seated!  Already FRUSTRATED, we thought that the food will at least make up for the bad experience, but it got even worse. The Pad Thai (spicy level 4) was unbelievably salty and the Gulf of Thai seafood dish was bland as the sauce was watered down. The QUALITY was as POOR as their SERVICE and NOT what we remembered and expected. We used to love this place, but this experience has left a salty taste in our mouths (pun intended)."}
{"text":"As always, my boyfriend and I were discussing what to do for dinner and we ended up heading towards Eastern and 215. There are so many options in this area but Thai food sounded the best. We had never been there before but decided to give it a try.  We were immediately greeted and sat in a nice booth on the side. I loved the atmosphere and decor. On every table was a vase with a flower.   The menu had a lot to choose from, while there was also a specials menu for the day.  A male server approached us and got our drinks. He was polite but I didn't catch anybody's name. There were several people who took care of us, all very nice.   The food was the truly impressive part. To start we ordered the crab rangoons. Next we enjoyed a silver noodle salad. And shortly after our beef soup came. I loved all items.  The manager cleared out plates at the end and boxed up our food togo.   We will definitely be coming back to try more items as we were pleased by the whole experience."}
{"text":"Really becoming one of my favorite places in NW part of town. The service is always excellent, the food is consistently well prepared and the atmosphere is excellent. The crab fried rice was awesome and the beef jerky appetizer is yum! No complaints and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been going here for about 2 years and I have to say it has been degrading over time. Flavor has not been on point for past year or so. Also Incredibly overpriced. Paid $12 for a \"dinner sized portion\" of veggie pad see ew and it was definitely a small lunch sized portion and the entire thing was lacking greatly in flavor. 4-5 hostesses at front desk, they should have more people making sure food quality is better and correct portions. Unfortunately this will be our last visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and and the prices for the lunch specials are very reasonable. I have tried at least 10 different dishes and I am always pleased. The service, however is sometimes a bit slow. I once waited 15 min for my server to return my card to me after I paid my bill. I had to practically beg him to run it so I could leave and get back to work, which is why I am only giving 4 stars."}
{"text":"introduced by a local. one of the best thai meals i had recently. garlic fish, spicy pad thai, green curry on spicy level 7 - everything was excellent.  attentive service, good price, quiet and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they were a tiny undiscovered hole in the wall. As they have grown the original charm has gone down somewhat, prices are up a little portion sizes down some but it remains our go to place for Thai. Good food in an elegant atmosphere hidden in a non descript strip mall. Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Omg this is by far my favorite Thai place!... though the only thing I've ever had is the green curry with avocado. SO GOOD I DREAM ABOUT IT. This is not a joke. I've literally had dreams about it. Restaurant has a great atmosphere too and they give you orange slices for desert... How refreshing!"}
{"text":"Unprofessional staff Overpriced food Will never go back there again. This is my 3rd bad experience here."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday with my son and we both enjoyed our food. Will definitely be going back for sure. The decor was nice on the inside and my Green Curry and his Red Curry were yummy.  In fact every time I come here the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Great food! I ordered the Combination fried rice, spicy basil pork (no spice) and the silver noodle soup.  I would pass on the silver noodle soup again, I ordered the hot pot and I felt the proportions were off. There wasn't enough chicken and it was hard scooping the noodles/veggies out of the bowl.  I absolutely loved the spicy basil dish and I plan on getting it again when I go back! The combination fried rice was also very good!   I wasn't to happy with our server, he kept leaving the table before everyone could order, totally not cool.   Overall a great restaurant with great food!"}
{"text":"Came here with high hopes on 12/21. Very nicely decorated dining area. Menu loaded with standard Thai appetizers and entrees. All very well prepared. Service was horrid from start to finish. After being seated by the gracious hostess, we waited 20 minutes for a server to appear. Then another 15 for our drink order to arrive. Three of the four dinners arrived at the same time, but the fourth came when everyone else was finishing. After waiting interminably for the check, we got up and headed for the door. That got the hostess' attention and she tracked down our check so we could leave.  Thinking our experience might be exceptional, I scanned other reviews, many of which tell the same sad story - basic Thai dishes prepared well but with lousy to atrocious service. Too bad."}
{"text":"My husband and I really like the food here. Recently we went to eat here and all the prices have gone up. Also, there was a bus boy just standing there watching us eat and as soon as a plate was done, he was there collecting it. Very annoying. Now, they are doing transactions at the table. It really cheapened the experience and makes us not want to go back."}
{"text":"The best thai hands down.  Don't miss the soups and the curry dishes.  Great imported pieces from thailand really add ambiance.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Really great Thai food. The inside is decorated with traditional Thai wood finishes. The staff is friendly and they have outdoor seating. Came here with a group of 4.... Being the family. Pad Thai is amazing"}
{"text":"This place has moved up on my radar.... Just had to give it a few tries! I like the spicy garlic clams and the service has improved! I look forward to trying more items on the menu... Please note a 9 is not spicy at all!  THE REALEST FOODIE OF LV!"}
{"text":"Let me begin this review with one word.  Yum.  Another word would probably be delicious.  In a town full of tacky Disney esque casino themes, this beautifully decorated Thai restaurant is truly one of the few remaining hidden treasures of the American Southwest.  The service was amazing.  At no point was I left with an empty glass, and the servers were personable and fun.  I highly recommend this place if you are craving Moderately priced, full valued Thai."}
{"text":"Very clean and nice place. Customer service is great, very friendly staff and they are on top of their game as far as keeping things clean off the table and drink refills. Our waitress Brenda was kind and got our order perfect also Felix the buser was just as helpful and packed our food for us. I got the yellow curry at a level is and I was worried after I ordered it that it would be to spicy but I was perfect, my boyfriend out the pineapple fried rice which was amazing."}
{"text":"I had the trout lemon grass, it was really good and flavorful , only thing was I wasn't used to the special Thai sauce that was in it because it kinda smelled like fermented fish, but besides that the trout was amazing and the lemon grass tasted great with it."}
{"text":"Now I'm picky about Thai food. I like traditional Thai. This is definitely the place. The Thai Iced Tea is definitely perfect. I love their Satay....Pineapple friend rice.....curry.....pad thai....thai beef salad....And when I want something hot...they make it hot. Not that gringo hot...It's like they go out of their way to give me food sweats and make me cry like a baby. There's another location on S Rainbow. I haven't tried it yet. But I'm hoping it's the same!!!"}
{"text":"This was great. I I sat on the patio on a Sunday morning for some lunch. The Thai curry blew me away. Really flavorful not too spicy something that I would come back day after day to eat."}
{"text":"My best friend is Thai and I worked at a Thai Restaurant all through high school and college so I am quite picky when it comes to Thai food. When I first moved to Vegas I was a bit hesitant to try this place because it wasn't off of Spring Mt. Where I was told all the good and legit Asian food was.   After hearing from several people that this is the best Thai food in Vegas, I decided to go.  The restaurant is really nice. And seemed to be pretty legit.  I ordered the Papaya Salad with dried shrimp (I'd rate it 8/10), Beef Jerky (my favorite dish from here- I'd rate it a 9/10), Thom Yum Goong (I had better, not too good here) and the Padt Thai (average- 6/10). The Papaya Salad and Beef Jerky were definitely my favorite. I will definitely be back and order these two dishes."}
{"text":"This place is really amazing, typically you get your food within 10 minutes (sometimes faster than that). They are very attentive, and their options for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters are wonderful. The yellow curry is great."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always come here when I am craving pad thai. I've tried their garlic chicken, which is very good too. I also tried their lemon grass soup, which I found disappointing. I have had way better soup in different places, and this one was VERY salty. I could only handle 2 spoonfuls (this is the only reason i give them a 4/5).   The service is good and they bring your food in a very reasonable time. I love the atmosphere here too. They are also very clean, and the bathroom has an amazing salt hand scrub, that I think you can purchase too. It leaves your hands very soft.   You can tell they really want to appeal to their customers."}
{"text":"Large portions, great quality, lots of options, Henderson location is awesome, the fact that they have multiple locations is even more awesome!  I would say that Pinkaow's traditional thai dishes are comparable to Lotus of Siam's and that they are simply just less busy."}
{"text":"Their food is really excellent. Delicious to a level I haven't been able to get in any other Asian restaurant in Vegas. Where most fail they excel here. Really impressed"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place for dine-in. After the experience I had I will hopefully be back many times in the near future. Service and food was spectacular. I got the Masaman Curry with chicken and may friend ordered the Pad Thai noodles with shrimp. We also ordered the Pineapple fried rice. There was so much flavor in everything that we were in heaven. The pineapple fried rice actually is served in half a pineapple which was different. Good company and good food. Cant ask for more."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Friday night. The place was super busy. The food was good. I had Kung Pao and my wife had Pad Tai. The potsticker appetizer was Fantastic! The food is 4 stars, but the server was 3 stars. She frequently forgot about us and I went to the hostess for service requests more than once. But despite that, it's a nice place and when I return, I'll hope for a different waitress."}
{"text":"I loved the food! Ordered everything at '7'. Spicy Eggplant was good and tasty and spicy enough to inspire liquid refreshment. Kung Pao Thai version had just enough peanuts, good size pieces of chicken, and got progressively spicier as it was eaten. The magic is in the sauce! The Chili Mint noodles were good, not very spicy (we'll have to amp that one up next time) but tasty and flavorful as a 'cool down' in comparison. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went here with a work lunch, which took just over an hour.The atmosphere was wonderful, and the staff was very friendly. The menu seemed quite large, but they had a simple \"lunch special\" page that seemed to have a nice variety at good prices.  I ordered the Red Curry with chicken, at a low-to medium spice level, and everyone else at my table ordered Pad Thai and the same Red Curry. The special came with a choice of salad or spring roll, and I ordered a spring roll, but received a Salad. The food came in a fairly staggered manner. There were five of us, and three of us received our food, (mine with the wrong side), then after about 5 minutes, a fourth dish came out, and after another 10, the 5th. Which short of left us with the \"do I eat while this is hot, or wait and not be rude\" conundrum. It ended up that they had confused the sides on the two curries, so I swapped with one of my co-workers, and it was not a big deal.  The food overall was good but lackluster. My curry seemed to rely on the spiciness as the primary seasoning, and could have used a little bit of salt or...something. Curry doesn't have to be hot in order to be flavorful; it seemed sort of one-dimensional, though the \"heat\" level was just as advertised, which is something I appreciate as a Spice Wuss.   The low point of the meal, though, was when I noticed that one of my companions who had ordered the Pad Thai, had a nice collection of egg shell bits gathered on the corner of his plate. It had taken him a minute, he said, to figure out what the sharp crunchy bits were.  I probably won't be back for dinner or on my own, but the proximity to my office and reasonable lunch prices will probably bring me back at least once more to see if they were just having an off day. Hopefully I can update this review with another star then! :)"}
{"text":"now... this is my FAVORITE thai restaurant. not as much variety as the last restaurant i reviewed but everything here is superb. their thai tea is not too sweet like most places. portions are big enough to share between two people. it gets really busy for dinner so expect a wait but its well worth it. staff is very friendly and attentive and you wont be broke when you leave..  great items to try:  cream cheese shrimp tempura (only at the south rainbow location)  panang curry (with chicken!) i love the string beans that come with it. careful guys.. they like to make it really spicy so dont go above a 4 (scale of 1-10) if you really cant eat spicy...  pad thai. everyones favorite. i like it with beef  they have a dinner special for 2. its about $20 per person and you get house wine or champagne. 2 salads. 2 entrees and rice. i chose pad thai and chicken panang and it was more than enough for the 2 of us. the salad had a yummy carrot ginger dressing. and i'm not a fan of wine or champagne but i had the white zin and it was delish."}
{"text":"The food was good, but because of our kids, who were behaving well, the manager judged us, she lied by telling us that they were out of glass cups, and gave us disposable cups, then continued to serve the customers next to us glass cup, I found that disrespectful from the manager Nattaya."}
{"text":"One of my more frequent Thai choices in Vegas. Nice patio area. Service usually solid. Mango rice dessert is decent. I usually order beef spicy salad (which I love here) and Thai spicy cashew chicken made 9 or 10 hot. Great brown sauce. Been here at least ten times. Consistently solid experiences."}
{"text":"Overall, decent Thai restaurant.  Food - 2.5/5 Service - 2.5/5 Atmosphere/Decor - 3.5/5  Coconut Shrimp Flavor: 2.5/5 Typical coconut shrimp served with a slightly sweet sauce. Light breading with a good amount of shredded coconut. The shrimp itself mostly tasteless. Served with shredded carrots and radish Portion size: 6 medium sized shrimp  Red Curry with tofu Flavor: 3.5/5 Ordered it \"very very spicy\" or a 10/10, was only mild. That said, the flavor was good. Vegetables were cooked correctly. Tofu was fried.   Rice - 5/5 - Perfectly cooked jasmine rice  Atmosphere / Decor - 3.5/5 Upscale feel.  Service - 2.5/5 Waitress was polite, but service was very slow. Took about 20 minutes for refills."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Egg rolls are nice crisp and sauces for varying dishes are always very good. Nice clean atmosphere and friendly staff very polite and accommodating ."}
{"text":"I love Pin Kaow! They are fast, consistent and the food is always yummy! This is my go-to Pad Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.  I order the chicken pad thai and spring rolls. It's the best! I recommend it. I've dined in the restaurant and have ordered out. The food is consistent across the board.   Go check them out ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, atmosphere and food.  Pineapple fried rice is my favorite.  We don't get to this location often; only when visiting family nearby."}
{"text":"I came here with a Korean friend and he stated that it was some of the best Thai food he's ever had.  I must agree it was by far some of the best I've had as well."}
{"text":"This location is in the super busy plaza on Richmar and Eastern across from BJ's, but finding parking wasn't too bad. For a Thursday night, the restaurant was busy, but we were able to get a table right away. It's a medium sized restaurant and really nice inside. It's not your typical hole in the wall Thai place. You could dress up and come here for dinner and fit right in.  The service and food were better than I had anticipated. I was starving so I wanted order like 4 things and have a bunch of left overs for my boyfriend. My friend is vegetarian so she ordered the spring rolls, which are deep fried so to me, that's egg rolls, but whatevs. She also ordered tofu green curry.   I ordered papaya salad, beef larb with a side of sticky rice, and chicken red curry. The papaya salad is really good, but it could stand a little bit more flavor. I'm used to the lao potent version, but this version is very refreshing and delicious. I'm scared of spice so I ordered it at a 3, and it was barely spicy. I wish I had stuck to 5.   The larb was really delicious. I love sticking my sticky rice in the plate one bite at a time. It's how we'd eat it when I was younger. Yum!    The red curry was also very good, but a little sweet for my taste. I added salt and it balanced out the sweetness and was perfect.   Overall I was super happy and satisfied. I would say it's one of my top Thai places in Vegas behind Lotus and Le Thai. However, compared to Lotus and Le Thai, the prices are WAY more reasonable. My 3 dishes and a Lychee Martini came to about $50 with tip. That's a steal!"}
{"text":"I have been back to Pin Kaow several times now and also have been to many other Thai places in the valley.  Here is my updates:  1.  The food - Still overall very decent, just not totally great. The food is nice and tasty and I like there spices overall. However, after trying so many Thai restaurants in the valley, I want to be wowed and the food here did not wow me.  2.  The service - I felt kind of like I was bothering them or it was very special for me to be eating here.  Very odd.  3.  The Ambiance -  If you want to have a large party, a quality environment, this is the place.  The decor is excellent, they have plenty of large tables and for most, it will suit the needs of parties of a variety of sizes.  I still say check it out, and it is a decent place to try for sure."}
{"text":"Come here on a regular basis as my mother in law lives close by. I have only ordered the yellow curry, fried rice and pad se ew (I think that's what there called) the noodles with soy sauce. I really love those 3 dishes I order and I'm very picky about my Thai food. It's always had really good flavor and the servings are pretty good also."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great staff. Affordable pricing.  I would recommend this place if you like Thai food. Best place in town.  The Thai scale is true to its numbers."}
{"text":"My family and I are regular customers since 2007, we just love the food!!! It's surprisingly delicious. The service is always excellent. I've tried other thai places... none of them are as good as Pin Kaow! Atmosphere is really calming and just amazing :)  I would give them 10 stars if I could"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I enjoy the food. Honestly the only thing I get is the pad Thai. It's one of the better thai restaurants on the Henderson side of town but it is nothing spectacular. My wife on the other hand concedes to coming here but would actually rather go to Thai BBQ on Sahara and Maryland Pkwy.   Like I said the food is good and customer service is friendly. Have never had a problem with the wait time or refilling my drinks. I wish they had the lunch specials on the weekend too but unfortunately not (No weekend lunch specials at Thai BBQ too). Lunch specials can be hit or miss with portion size too. I've walked away before after having lunch here just to still be hungry soon afterwards."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow got the Beef Jerky Pow!!  This restaurant is definitely better than the average \"Thai BBQ\" that everyone is so fond of.  Came here on a Saturday night, enjoyed the open air in their dining patio and enjoyed 6 very different dishes that were Thai Tasty.  Their Beef Jerky was not to be reckoned with!  It was sweet and salty, crunchy and tender, and paired perfectly with their sticky rice.  We also enjoyed Tom Yum Kha which packed a delightful sour punch, the mango salad with fried tofu was fresh, the original Phad Thai classic, the Sea Bass at its finest and some kind of shrimp with fried garlic which passed the test.    The service here was exceptional.  All staff were costumed with Thai Garments, the decor had that Far East Flare, both which boosted the restaurants authenticity.  I recommend this place to anyone who needs a hunger fix.  I'll definitely be making my second rounds!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food with amazingly authentic Thai atmosphere.  We dined here for lunch which happens to be an amazing deal.  Chicken Pad Thai comes with an egg roll, Rangoon, and soup all for just $7.95!  I was shocked and amazed not only at the price, but the quality of food that was served.  Other Thai restaurants charge at least $11-$12 for the same thing, but without all the extras.  This place is far superior to any other Thai restaurant in the Las Vegas Valley.  As for service, it was excellent.  Our waters didn't get close to half empty before being refilled.  Also the attention to detail on our orders was second to none.  I'd heard great things about this place in the past, and I must say that I'm hooked.  Expect to see me at least once a week to enjoy your amazing food.  Thank you so much for keeping up a phenomenal establishment."}
{"text":"Really good Thai! I order the spiciest level they have and they do not let me down.  Nice restaurant and we have been there at least 20 times."}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent I went here with Julie Desiree and Jason tonight calamari appetizer is to die for entr√©es were very good there curry was excellent my only complaint was the server seemed a bit confused they didn't know who ordered what when it came to our drinks or our entr√©es and when they plated the table they didn't bring all the entr√©es irregardless the food was excellent"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the original location many times and the food is always good but the decor pales in comparison.  They really went all out with opening of the new branch.  The interior is largely done in rich wood with intricate paneled walls.    I came in recently around the grand opening.  They had traditional Thai instruments being played by musicians and a dancer performing cultural dances.    The soups and currys are excellent here.  They offer Chinese dishes in addition which allows more options for those who don't like there food as spicy as I do."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Service was awesome as they were always checking up on us. Chicken pad Thai and fried rice was delish."}
{"text":"I avoided this place for quite some time because the exterior comes across very much like a dive bar. I gave in last night due to a sticky rice craving and was pleasantly surprised. The interior was a beautiful, cozy little restaurant. The servers were very pleasant but could have been a bit more attentive. The service was slow overall but still very good. The portions were good and food was very fresh but could use a little more kick of flavor. Overall, I was very satisfied with my visit and I'm looking forward to many more visits in the future."}
{"text":"This is my second time back in a week cuz my first meal was great. This time was not as good. I came before  dinner rush would start and they said they ran out of the wide noodle. How do you run out of noodles at a Thai place right before the dinner crowd even started? For that reason I can't give 4 star. Dinner portion aren't much bigger than lunch. But yummy and fresh."}
{"text":"I have come here a number of times and have always been pleased. The service in the past was a little hit or miss but the last few times the service has been excellent. We tend to order pad Thai, Nam Sod, Tom Kha soup, and Panang curry. I wish there was a little less green beens in the Panang curry and more chicken but otherwise everything is very tasty. Not sure if the happy hour is new or I just was never here in time but there are several tasty bites and nice deal on Singha beer. A consistently enjoyable meal, I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very attentive waiter and waitress! I enjoyed My Pad Thai noodles and sticky rice. Also love the decoration and design inside. Coming back again forsure!"}
{"text":"Great food, but service was ridiculously slow.  Three of us got our entr√©es and the server went to get the fourth.  The three of us were nearly done eating by the time the fourth came.  But it tasted great!"}
{"text":"Overall okay. We got the Tom Ka soup, could be more creamier and a bit over price for the size. We also ordered Pla Koong salad, too much ginger and Thai chicken salad, not really a salad just chicken with cucumbers. So not what we really expected but the taste and service were good."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend and I've been twice and disappointed both times. The food the first time just wasn't very good.  The second time I went, they rushed our food out so fast. My friend had no time to finish her soup before her next plate was aggressively thrown down on the table. The appetizer I got was cold and I don't think it should have been.  I ordered the avocado curry. Chicken had no flavor and I had a bone in my meat. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious as usual & hit the spot!  Great lunch amount especially for the price!    Yum yum"}
{"text":"I was so happy to hear that a close friend was in town.  I asked him to join me for lunch one and his response was that he was in the mood for Thai food.  I knew there was only one place we could go that was close to both of us and offered a really great menu.  Yes, Pin Kaow!!  This place is located in a HUGE strip mall along with other great places like BJs.  The restaurant is dark with lots of wood: blinds, walls, counter space, you name it. The smell of incense fills the air and the bar is a dramatic focal point with a mock roof top. The place is filled with wooden sculptures of koi fish, lots of Thai tribal designs on the wall and between the booths, all of it is super cool. Servers are dressed in authentic Thai outfits with lots of light orange and green colors.  I thought they were super nice and always checked on our table frequently.  I also liked how everyone pitched in.  Our drink order was taken by one server.  Our food order was taken by another.  Other servers would come by the check on us and I thought that was cool.    On this visit, although it was during my lunch break, I got a glass of the Altanuta Pinot Grigio for $8.95. I thought it was light and crisp, the way Grigio should taste like.  For my lunch, I got the lunch special chicken Pad Thai with a Thai salad for $8.95. The Pad Thai was awesome.  I got a number 4 in the spicy range.  The rice noodles were accompanied with fresh bean sprouts and crushed peanut in Thai special recipe sauce. The salad components were romaine and shredded carrots, super typical.  What I really liked was the Thai vinaigrette dressing.  I made the salad refreshing and flavorful.    Such great company and great food.  Definitely want to check out Pin Kaow if you ever have a Thai craving.  There's three locations around the valley.  This location is the only location I've been too, but I love it!  Super convenient, great staff and food that's YUM-O!"}
{"text":"Really really good...especially for the Summerlin area  Can't wait to go back the service was spot on as well"}
{"text":"So my review is judging by the food as we came and picked up to-go to take over to a friends house in the area. I must say this is the nicest looking Thai restaurant though when we came for our food.  What we tried -   Panang Chicken - this was decent, its a thicker curry sauce than usual though and had peppers and green beans with it. Just my preference that I don't like it as peanutty and thick.   Pad Thai Tofu - they give you the option steamed or fried, but I went with fried. This was actually a rather good pad thai! Definitely liked this quite a bit.   Spicy Basil Chicken - this was good, but it's a easy/ standard dish. Solid for what it is.    Chili Fried Rice Pork - pretty good fried rice as far as fried rice goes. It was interesting in that it has bell peppers and broccoli in it which I normally don't see along with tomato, basil and meat which I expected.   We ordered everything with no spice since one of our friends can't tolerate any of it. They packed me up hot sauce, dried chili powder and jalapeno vinegar which was a nice touch when I asked for some hot sauce. I like my stuff spicy!  We also got two orders of mango sticky rice and theirs was solid. It had a half mango and two squares of sticky rice per order so it was a good size. While it's a basic recipe, sometimes the basics are easy to screw up and theirs didn't disappoint.   Portions were good. Everyone ( 4 adults, 2 kids) were all fed and happy with the food. I would say dine in or take out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I'm sure many dishes here are amazing, but my favorite are any of the curry dishes and the spring roles. Many dishes offer a vegetarian option, which is nice. Both for carry-out and dine-in the service is quick and friendly. Order/arrive early on the weekends, this place gets packed! I will definitely miss this place."}
{"text":"It's funny how conveniently close this is to my MIL's place, but we've always somehow passed it up since there were some favorite Thai places established among the family. However, I've been meaning to come and seized the opportunity when it was my choice of food for family dinner.   While it is in a typical shopping center, the inside is much nicer than any other Thai places around with it's wood carved panel decor. It's the type of Thai place you could take a casual date. This time I picked up my order to-go, but I will definitely sit in next time.   We had -   Massuman curry with tofu - this to me reminded me for of a panang, but still very good. Actually grandma really, really liked this one and asked to order it in the future.   Mongolian beef - It was decent, just not my style of mongolian beef. This is that Thai Chinese style brown sauce kind that I'm eh about, but it was properly cooked and seasoned.   Chili Mint Noodles - These are wide noodles in a soy, chili flavoring with basil leaves. I rather liked this, real flavorful and spicy. If you like wide noodles and something like pad se ew but dont feel like sweet, then go with these.  Mango sticky rice - their version I had at another location and quite like it. Also the portion is generous with two squares of rice when most places give you one. The rice was cooked right, the coconut cream was seasoned, half mango was ripe.  I can't comment really on service since my first experience was to-go, but the people were always polite and courteous on the phone and in person. Better than average ordeal of getting stuff ordered right.   Will be back for a dine in soon."}
{"text":"Great Thai food in Eastern Ave., with fresh coconuts you can drink from.  Try the spicy basil beef with extra vegetables.  Great atmosphere and patio for dining.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Me and my best friend went to this Thai restaurant because it was closer to where we were ,according to yelp review they have three and a half star but we just gave it a try anyway. We ordered the tom yum soup with shrimp and they brought it cold we have to tell them to reheat it and we ordered  pad Thai shrimp and chicken basil  the taste was mediocre but we was just catching up they keep coming and started asking us if we were done as if they are telling us to  go but we kept our conversation. Very unprofessional and pushy I am really dussapointef with the service."}
{"text":"A very nice cozy and authentic Thai restaurant. Have eaten there multiple times and it's always been a good experience. Friendly servers and good cooks. This location only, the South eastern address is a diff story. And have never been to other south side location"}
{"text":"A friend brought over some chicken pai Thai from this restaurant. Not sure about pricing but the portions are plentiful for the single to go order.  Noodles were well cooked and flavorful. The order came with a bed of bean sprout that was a nice change in texture as the noodles become mundane half way through the meal. The spicy garlic sauce was pretty good  as well. I'll probably venture out trying other items next time.   Overall not bad at all and wouldn't mind having this as take out again in the future."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here and catch up with a girlfriend of mine. Since it was conveniently located on Eastern between Silverado Ranch and Serene we both decided to eat here.  Location is pretty good easy to spot it's in the same shopping center as Bjs restaurant.  As we entered we were greeted with a happy smile with the staff in their authentic native thai clothing. The entire restaurant gave that Thai feel and the ambiance was amazing too as well. Not to loud and you can easily hold a conversation at your table without screaming.  We ordered the Chinese broccoli with chicken which was delicious. Been loving the greens lately since i'm on a special diet.  Next we also ordered the pineapple fried rice mixed with cashews, raisins , and pineapple literally served on a pineapple. Really awesome!.  For another entree we ordered the Sea Bass which was to die for, it was incredible delicious, it better be it was pricey and from Bangkok  For noddles we decided to have the Silver Noodle Salad, a bit too spicy for me but still really good.  We were both kind of disappointed since the mango salad was not available. They only have it during mango season time,  For drinks we had a lycee martini which was really good it did not even taste like alcohol and also Thai coffee.. bomb digidy also!  For dessert we decided to have the fried banana with coconut ice cream! I really loved it! Specially the coconut ice cream, it tasted the same in Thailand.  As far as authenticity of the food it tastes exactly the same in Thailand.  I would love to go back to this place and suggest it to everyone. I also heard there is live entertainment on the weekends so I might go back and check it out."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Wednesday evening. We were seated quickly, the restaurant was about half full. Service was quick and friendly. I ordered the chicken fried rice and the egg rolls, both were flavorful. I'd come back here again when in town."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice about this place is their amazing decor.   Every area is breathtaking.  The employees are dressed up in what I'm assuming is Thailand's native wear.  Their outdoor patio is gorgeous.  Every plant and all the flowers are real.  Beautiful orchids even those in the bathroom.  They had a wonderful hand scrub in the women's bathroom that they sell.  It leaves your hands very moisturized and refreshed.  The food was delicious.  The best tom yum kai I've ever had.  I had my typical order of red curry and pad thai, which was pretty good as well.  That soup I have still been craving for days.  I wish I got the hotspot so I could'be taken it home.  I believe we were there when the lunch staff was either about to leave or take a break because the initial staff was very helpful and always checking on us, but when we were about to pay for our check we didn't see them at all and the rest of the staff ignored us.  Lastly, the price is great considering the quality of the food and the whole atmosphere of the restaurant"}
{"text":"I dont know what the fuss is all about. Sure, the restaurant seems grandeur with all kind of thai decoration inside, the elephant wall ornament, and the huge waterfall pot outside the restaurant. But I go to restaurant for the food and the food only.  As far as I am concern they geared their food towards white people taste. Seriously if you want to open a thai restaurant, be a thai restaurant. Dont be like PF Changs. Chinese restaurant wannabe. Thats how I feel about this restaurant. Cant change anything, food are mediocre, although service are attentive, they should be cos hey charge almost double than any regular thai restaurant with better food.   Will I come back to this restaurant, probably not, its a one and done for me."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Thai restaurants I've been to. Food, service, all was crap.  I'll start with the food, cause that's the most important part. I got the red curry, with tofu. Super bland, no spice to it, even when I asked for their highest level of spicy.(they rate form 1-5) I don't know why they feel the need to \"American\"-ize it and make it gross. People go to Thai places for Thai food. If I wanted bland ass American food I'd go somewhere else. I even added in chilli (which took forever to request and get) and it didn't help. A friend I was with got the Pad Thai, which was just as horrible. It was way too sour and also lacked any spice.  the service was slow and rude, and in an almost completely empty restaurant, they felt the need to sit a family with three infant and toddler children next to us. How. Pleasant. We left quickly after that, and were glad to. Pretty bland place with bland food, won't be returning"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant. I alway need to get the tom Kai soup and pad Thai  it's the best.  They do a great job on how spicy you want it. It's from 1-10.  They always fill up your water glass. It's weird. But the don't let it go half ways. Hands down the best pad Thai I have ever had and I been to plenty Thai places."}
{"text":"Great food! Nice ambiance and good service! Can't believe this is 3  1/2 stars on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Great food and service but they make you feel rushed and that they need to turn your table before you are through."}
{"text":"Great Thai place! Make a reservation if you can, this place is usually pretty busy! Tom Kah soup is excellent! Also love their chicken panang! One of my go to spots!"}
{"text":"Two of my co-workers have been telling me that Pin Kaow is one of their favorite Thai Restaurants in Las Vegas.  Once I realized it was a mere 7 minute drive I knew I had to check it out.  I went with my husband on a Sunday afternoon, and I won't lie I was pretty taken back when I walked inside (in a good way).  The outside is your basic strip mall, but once you walk inside the decor makes you feel like you were transported out of Las Vegas and into Thailand (or at least what it might look like in my head since I have never been there).  The place had a good sized crowd, but there were still a few tables left.    Unfortunately, both my husband and I had a lot of work to do so we decided to order to go and did not get the full dining experience.  Despite not eating there, I was still impressed by their service.  The lady who took our order was very nice and we received our food very quickly.  After placing our order I think we were out the door in about 10 minutes.  When we go home and started to dig in we found out taste buds fully satisfied and stomach approved of the great portion sizes.    We ordered two basics, Chicken Pad Thai (9.95) and Beef Pad See Ew (9.95).  I know we weren't too adventurous, but I had to make sure they did the basics right.  Yay for Pin Kaow, both executed wonderfully and I recommend both dishes to anything thinking of trying this place.  I look forward to returning in the future to try their curries, rice dishes, and many more.  I'm pretty sure I've found my go to Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"So glad that yelp led us here! The restaurant is located in a strip mall surrounded by by bigger fancier strip malls with neon lighted chain restaurants. Don't be distracted by the neon lights and come here instead! We ordered the shrimp egg rolls which were really good but not traditional. The were basically just shrimp in egg roll paper and deep fried with a delicious dipping sauce. For entrees we ordered the duck curry and their special \"Gulf of Thailand\". The duck curry was amazing. The actual curry broth was the best we both had ever had and we were just covering our rice in it at the end so we wouldn't waste any. The special was very good and had tons of different seafood. The star of the dish was the scallops so I would definitely order any thing that has scallops. We also ordered the Thai ice tea which wasn't great but pretty standard. We would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Love the mint chicken and sticky from here. Plus the waiting staff is really friendly and always go out there way to make you happy. I highly recommend eating here they are almost like home cooking very good"}
{"text":"The food tasted good, but the quantity seem as if it was the lunch special with nothing else. I felt as if I payed for a 1/2 order but nope, full price for what seems 1/2 an order & what seemed as left overs."}
{"text":"Our first time at this restaurant.   We will be back many times I'm sure.   We got soup, chili fried rice, pad Thai and finished it off with creme br√ªl√©e.   The portions, price and taste were great.  On a scale of 1-10 (spice).  We did everything in 10.   It was great if you can handle the heat!"}
{"text":"Pin Kaow has the best egg rolls I've ever had. And they pair perfectly with the red curry. They don't make their food super spicy; I get #10 on everything. It's a heat that doesn't burn, it warms you from the inside. The staff are very friendly and the manager, Toy, is a genuine sincere guy. He just came into our area playing guitar and singing. This guy is awesome!"}
{"text":"Overall it is ok, we ordered Tom yum soup, masama beef curry and pineapple fried rice, a little bit disappointed about masama beef, the curry soup base tastes good, but the beef doesn't taste that good,and the presentation of the dish is not great either , they should at least put some green basil leave in it, right now it looks plain, there are just some beef and potato in it. The Tom yum soup tasted really good,would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Good constant Thai restaurant. Much nicer inside then the outside would have you believe. This is one of my default or fall back places."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant on the NW side! Amazing,  fresh, delicious food and fast, exceptional service.  Can't beat it hands down."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Thursday. It wasn't packed so we were able to get a table for 3 without waiting.  The decor of the restaurant is kind of fancy, and the wait staff have nice, authentic-looking uniforms.   They have lunch specials ($8) which come with soup, egg roll and fried wonton. The beef chow mein was alright - nothing to rave about. My friends ordered the chicken pad thai and a glass noodle dish + rice. The servings were pretty decently sized.   I'm not the biggest Thai food fan so this may not be the best review to follow, but bottom line - good service, food and awesome decor!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I eat here probably once a week! The service is great in the restaurant and the take out is always fast and easy!"}
{"text":"When I walked in, I thought, \"We're not in Vegas anymore.\" Floor to ceiling wood paneling, Thai pop and servers outfitted in traditional attire, transported me to a magical, happy place. I love it when an unassuming strip mall spot knocks me off my design feet. For this reason alone, put this spot on your short list for dates and other occasions that require impressing. It is the perfect combination of adventurous eats with charming surroundings.  The service was friendly, but they failed to inform us that brown rice is an additional $3/person! Mouth dropping upcharge. When our bill arrived, we informed them of our concern, and they kindly only charged us for one brown rice. Sadly, having to pay $6 for both me and my husband to enjoy brown rice will probably prevent us from returning. I know it seems like a small thing, but that is practically the price of an entire entree during lunch specials, which they do offer with soup, eggroll and fried wonton.  Even so, I can say that the red curry is a fine specimen of curry. The server recommended the massaman, but it is not available as a lunch special. The chicken and rice soup was a bit salty; the egg roll was simply ok, and the fried wonton is just an odd item to me without at least some variety of filling.  Overall, the food and environment are top notch, but I happen to be a brown rice stickler. It's just one of my things. Still, I love a place in Vegas that does the strip mall proud."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in town. They have Great customer service. I've Been going to Pin Kaow for over 15 years. I've been to all 3 locations and now I live near Eastern location. So delicious. A must try if you like Thai food!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai restaurant. It's by far the best Panang Curry and Pad Thai in a long time!"}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to place whenever I'm craving Thai food! The atmosphere is very peaceful due to the dim lighting and authentic decor. I always get the Pad Thai with steamed tofu and I'd have to say it's the best I've had so far. The service is quick and friendly so definitely no complaints. If you get a chance to try the Sweet Rice with Mango while it's in season, please do because you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here for a fun ladies night with Lisa L. and future yelper Theresa. While the company got 5 stars in this review I'll stick to the food . I had had takeout from here prior to this dinner a couple times. I know people rave about Pin Kaow but I do prefer Archi's & Lotus. I think if this was the only Thai show in town mb It would be getting a 4 star, but in comparison I think Pin Kaow falls short.   Things I've had at Pin Kaow for takeout: *Duck fried rice - yummy, but probably only an ounce of edible duck meat. The rest was all grisel/fat. So that blew. *Mongolian beef - only my nutty husband would order this at a Thai place ! Yup, not good at ALL. I can't fault them for this, I fault my husband for ordering it ! *Pad see ew - my favorite thai dish of all time. Archi's and Lotus are way better. The issue I have with Pin Kaow is their noodles are hella bland. I want some of that dark sauce deliciousness in my noodles!  Dinner with Lisa L! *papaya salad with \"crab\". Ok the crab wasn't edible it was tiny weird slivers of crab shell. It was insanely spicy at a level 5. *Duck/mint - really tasty, however I thought the portion was kinda stingy for $15 or so. I could get WAY more duck at say Satay or Joyful House for that kinda price.  *Curry - So Lisa ordered the curry as a 7/10 and I decided to be brave and try it despite the fact I don't do spicy. UMM it wasn't spicy at all?!? I know spice is subjective but if this spice-fearing woman can down a 7/10 at a thai restaurant your scale is messed up, sorry! *Mango/sticky rice - So glad Lisa shares my love of this so we were able to get one to share! Beautiful presentation and flawless execution.  Atmosphere is decent, service is decent, but overall the only reason I frequent this place is the location. I wish we had better Thai on this side of town, but sadly we don't. Archi's and Lotus are worth the drive to me 9 times out of 10!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service curry chicken was delicious as well as cashew shrimp.   This place is perfect for Date or just a night out."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, my first time here was absolutely delightful. The restaurant seems clean, in and outdoor seating, and interesting decor. I recommend dinning outside on a nice day.   Service was perfect, the waiters/servers/bussers were very attentive and we never had to ask for anything, they made sure our waters were full and plates were taken off the table accordingly.   I had the pleasure of trying the PUMPKIN CURRY- SO FRICKEN GOOD- HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Spiciness was #5 and it was  just perfect, spicy, but not overwhelming at all. Dish size just enough for two, but not if one person is especially hungry :b   I had the PORK PAD THAI, spicy#7, I like my food spicy and surprisingly #7 didn't cut it, I recommend #8 maybe even #9 for the pad Thai. The noodle texture was a bit off, I wished they were cooked a little longer and hardened. On a scale of 1 to 5, I'd say 3.   They had some drink specials and a decent drink menu. I had the TYKU TINI- it was dry with a hint of sweet sour lime- didn't enjoy it much- so I recommend a CHANG to compliment your meal as it's very refreshing.   Definitely coming back for great curry and great service."}
{"text":"Wow I didn't go to this place for a long time because I moved and the food is way better than before."}
{"text":"There was a bug in my water so I asked the lady if she could get me a new glass of water. She comes back and she had just refilled my water, the bug was still in the glass... WOW! She must have not heard or understood me...   The food isn't spicy enough, it was good but there are better places. The restaurant itself is nice and at a convenient location."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and their service is great!  They are always polite and attentive when I go there either to dine in or carry out."}
{"text":"Oh Pin Kaow, do you ever do wrong?  I hope not, because it's all been great so far.   This location is next to my work, Pin Kaow 1 near my house, and it's all delicious no matter where in the valley!  Their decor is just as rad as their other locations;  it's like a bit of Thailand has slipped through the strip mall paradise of this Henderson commercial center.  And their outdoor patio is nice;  maybe not in 106, but it's nice when it's not en fuego outside.  Last visit I had a great chicken satay and a green curry that was savory to say the least.  Great portions.  My only sad moment was when the appetizer was a dollar less than the entree.  Ouch!      Still, a delightful establishment."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place, be it in-restaurant dining or take-out.  They have ample portions of well-spiced Thai dishes or mouth-soothing curries -- and even both at once!  They let you choose the fire level of your dish -- but honestly, if you're a person who likes spice, ask them to make it \"Thai spicy\" instead of saying 9 or 10.  You'll get the right stuff.  They're very prompt with your order and you can pick up in generally 10 minutes.  The ambience in the restaurant lends itself to either groups or perhaps a date night.  One of my favorite restaurants in Summerlin."}
{"text":"It's always a hit to eat this deliciousness nectar of the gods Thai food restaurant. Panang curry is bomb, pad Thai (fried tofu) is BOSS and the tasty beef jerky never leaves my mind even days after enjoying it. What's even better is that they deliver. Imagine having heaven delivered to you right at your doorstep?? Only downside is that delivery takes a bit longer than I like. But overall I'm very satisfied with this place. It's too bad they don't deliver beer, too."}
{"text":"If I was to sum this place up or would be: Overpriced and Overrated. We came here on a weekend afternoon. It wasn't that busy, we got a booth right away. We ordered thai ice teas, chicken skewers, Tom ka soup, the duck special. None of these dishes were memorable and I can't even remember the names. The Tom Ka was so salty it burnt my throat. The duck was OK, but very small! The skewers were average and kind of pink inside (which always scares me). It was my first time here and I was VERY disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my little spot that I go to for lunch with my mom. Today we ordered papaya salad with fresh, grilled shrimp, the lunch fried tofu pad thai with soup, fried wonton & spring roll with sweet chili sauce, and the regular pad se ew with beef. It was soo good, the server told us that on the papaya salad a '7- on spiciness scale' is equivalent to a '9 or 10' for a regular entree dish. She said it was because papaya salad is one of the more spicier dishes they have. It was perfect for us because we are korean and we like our food with a kick. If you look at the dinner entree dish- pad se ew and compare the quantity with the lunch pad thai is the same. The only difference between the two dishes was the appetizers like the soup, wonton, and spring roll that comes with it for $2 cheaper! What a fab foody find!!!!!"}
{"text":"Lovely inside, attentive staff! Food was tasty but not amazing... cocktails very weak."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be a knock out of the park for me. With such a huge space, nicely decorated, and tons of people inside I figured we hit the jackpot for Thai food. They had a huge menu with tons of food, but none of it really looked like anything special. Many of the dishes I've had in other Thai places I've eaten at.  The waitress was nice but rushed us as soon as we sat down. She handed us each a menu and asked what we wanted to drink. We were looking around for the bar menu and she looked very exasperated that we didn't shout our order out to her right then. After 20 minutes she brought us out drinks and asked if we wanted to order. We were in no rush so we asked to place an appetizer order and order out meals later. The waitress seemed confused at this request and after we told her our appetizer order she asked what we wanted for our main course. We told her, again, we were not in a rush and would order our dinners in a few minutes. 10 minutes later another women (the manager maybe) came and asked us if we had any problems. We told her no and that we were enjoying ourselves. She then asked if we were ready to order our dinners. We told her we'd look over the menu and order soon. She told us it was ok and she'd wait to take our order..... so needless to say this made us rush.   The food was nothing out of this world. It reminded me of Chinese take out we have back home. The drinks were pricy and the waitress brought us another round of saki even though we didn't ask for it. She said it was ok and left it at the table.... only to find out later they charged us for it (which was taken care of before we paid the bill). Next time we're in town we'll be looking for another spot to eat some decent Thai food"}
{"text":"I know: de gustibus non est disputandum, but having lived in Thaliand for a very long time, this place is the closest to authenticity you will ever get this side of the Mississippi. Portions are americanized cause no self-respecting thai will ever be caught dead or alive with a full plate of anything in front of her/him to finish all alone, preferring rather the choice of a number of small dishes from fish to beef washed down with fresh veggies - taste and eat -play with a group of people (as they lovingly say in thai), and apart from one busy evening where the hostess was annoyingly pedantic and going on about the benefits of calling up front to make a reservation, I simply love this place. Sticky rice, beef jerky and somtam will take you straight to a new level of awareness. Haven't tried the other branches, but the Rainbow/Lake Mead is a culinary retreat. Great service every time."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place ever. Always come here for lunch. Has amazing customer service and the food is sooooo good."}
{"text":"Normally this place is on point... the staff is always amazing... today not so much... not sure if they have a new cook but today their food is not up to their normal standards of amazing so that's why I'm giving them a 3 star... very very disappointing"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening and ordered  1. Pad Thai with fried tofu. Spice lvl 5: 9.95 2. Spicy mint with beef, Spice lvl 7: 9.95 3. Yellow curry with chicken, Spice lvl 7: 10.95 for $37   - An amazing venue. Pin Kaow does an excellent job of creating an authentic theme. Although, the Michael Buble music in the background didn't help, it was fine.  - We were seated right away and serviced very quickly. Nutcha and Max were our servers. - Service was pleasant. We got our drinks and dishes relatively quickly on a busy Saturday night. - The flavoring of the Yellow curry was creamy. Chicken was tender. The only disappoint was that there seemed to be more potatoes than chicken. haha.  - We had an option to chose whether our tofu with the pad thai could be soft or fried. The pad thai was good. Definite recommendation. Better than in Krung Siam in chinatown.  - The spicy mint beef was a letdown. dry, not too flavored. I had to request a spice rack to give it a bit more zest. haha. Another thai restaurant that I have been too makes the same dish but also with tofu at a cheaper price and taste better, so this caught us off guard.  - For similar pricing and nearby, I'd rather dine a Gaati Thai simply bc it tasted a bit better. This place is nice for dates."}
{"text":"I'm thankful my office is close to this restaurant. The perfect time to come here is around lunch time. Not only do they have awesome lunch specials (an entree, spring roll and a fried wonton for a very reasonable price), they're also not extremely busy like they are at dinner time. The wait at night can be up to 45 minutes.  What I normally get: Thai iced tea, fried tofu, spring rolls, chicken wings, pad Thai, crispy pork with Chinese broccoli, satay, combination fried rice and sweet sticky rice with mango for dessert (when it's in season around May-July).  I've been going here since I moved to Vegas in 2006 and I can't recall having a bad experience.  I've been to other Thai restaurants but Pin Kaow is my favorite because the service and the food are always consistent plus, the location is convenient.  Their spiciness rating is from 1-10 (it doesn't fluctuate)."}
{"text":"Super yummy food. My husband and I came here for lunch with our 4 kiddos (10,9,3,2). We ordered 4 lunch specials. Plenty of food. The soup was sooo good. My 3 year old couldn't get enough. We also really enjoyed the chow mein, fried rice, and sweet and sour. Friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai place. The best in Vegas. Like other reviewers mentioned, the outside looks a bit decrepid, but the interior is a feast for eyes! It is decorated with Thai artwork, has candles lit on each table-cloth adorned table and all of the wait staff is dressed in traditional Thai garb. They play Thai music and serve many traditional Thai alcolohic beers, too.   The food is superb, up there with the atmosphere. My favorite is probably Tom Ka Kai soup and tofu and mint entre and mango and sticky rice desert. But, it's hard to choose sometimes, as all of it is extremely delicious! Their curries are good, their salads are out of this world, and the service is excellent. Take out is also offered.  Overall, I am glad that I tried this place, despite the unadorned exterior. I recommend it to all who like ethnic places with a bit of flair and much authenticity. Try it out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in town.  The avocado curry and pad Thai are so good. Great service and ambiance. It's good for couples, families or catching up with friends."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for years. Great service, incredible food, and reasonable prices. I recommend this place for locals and for tourists looking for a place off the strip."}
{"text":"I must say this is one of my favorite thai places in town.  Unless, I havent gone to a thai restaurant that is better than pin kaow.    The decor is very intricate and different from any other thai restaurants I have been.  What I usually order: Crab rangoon Thai BBQ  & Thai Tea  All three items is delicious and not too pricey.  The service is wonderful and I hardly every have to request for refills for my drink, since they are pretty adamant in checking up on you throughout your time there.   Also, from the friends I have been they would order curry and they love it and especially since they are not really a big fan of asian food."}
{"text":"Lunch special alert! Big ole plate fulla nummy yummy!  The lunch specials range from $8-10 depending on which meat you select.  There are 10 dishes to choose from that all come with a soup and eggroll or wonton choice.  I opted for the ginger pork with an eggroll, which was delicious.  My only complaint is that their spicy ratings are weak sauce.  But the delicious garlic spicy sauce on the table will remedy that.    Service is prompt, friendly, and efficient.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting with beautiful decor.  Nice date spot too, not noisy at all.  And if you're fortunate enough to live near by, they deliver.  Always arrives much sooner than they estimate over the phone."}
{"text":"I first ate here several years ago when I was simply Thai-curious and not in a full blown relationship with Thai food as I am now.  The first time I went to Pin Kaow was all about discovery and I ordered the Pad Thai as it was the dish I'd heard most about.  I probably should have gone with something a little more adventurous or exciting but I wasn't that kind of guy back then!  The Pad Thai was okay, maybe a little boring.  I spent a little more than I thought it was worth but looking back on it now it was a cheap first date considering what this love has blossomed into.  On further visits when I was much more experienced having visited other Thai mistresses such as LOS, Prommares, Weera, and Archi (?!), I tried other dishes like the Salmon Chu-Chee (Salmon in Red Curry), Spicy Basil with Pork, Thai Beef Salad, Crying Tiger Beef, and the Tom Yum Koong hot pot (a VERY good version).   I always walk away satisfied leaving my money and tip on the table, but cant help but think of the more exotic offerings I've been exposed to at the equivalent in price Lotus  or the cheaper Weera.    I've found myself slowly weening off of Pin Kaow as the months pass, only visiting her on occasions where I find it convenient.   Don't worry though, I'll try to remember to write once in a while."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Vegas I think- I love eating there as the atmosphere is lovely, especially outside. Their pannang curry is delicious as well as the chili mint noodles.  I live close to here, thai house and gallanga- we have a hard time choosing!! They just started a punch card which I think will sway our decision more often:)"}
{"text":"We ordered food to go at this restaurant. They told us we would have to wait 30 minutes. Instead, the wait was 1 hour and 10 minutes. I will never go back. The food is better at Gaati and they don't make you wait forever."}
{"text":"After trying Lotus of Siam, I can no longer say that Pin Kaow is the best Thai food I've had in Vegas. It is, however still delicious and enjoyable. It's closer to my house and will still be in my rotation for the convenience."}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas about month ago this is the nearest Thai place close to my apartment. And this is my experienced First time That was when I was on vacation visit Las Vegas. -Decoration inside restaurant make me happy and feel good 50% already before order the food. It located in the mall and look so simple like normal Asian places and I thought it will be simple chairs and tables and could be not that clean inside,but when I get in all Thai decoration everything so clean and nice. Me and my boyfriend we were ordered  ChickenTom kha soup spicy level 7 ( too creamy and less spicy then we expected by the way I'm Thai originally from Thailand my spicy level is real Thai my boyfriend he's American and he likes spicy same level as mine ) Crying tiger the meat was ok nothing special the sauce it's ok it's nothing bad but nothing special either Pad Woonsen with chicken this dish same it was ok nothing special and maybe because week before we were in Thai town Los Angeles we liked food there more I feel more authentic and reasonable price my boyfriend also liked in Thai town more.  Second time  I moved here already I was checking neighborhood this area and I was so craving for Thai food and I remember this place so I go there again for lunch.  -I ordered Mongolian beef I didn't order lunch special or anything like that if they have but portion come out so small I thought maybe I'm too hungry or something anyway I'm pretty sure my first visit food portion was bigger overall food was ok not bad.    Third time  -This is first time I come here for dinner first was late lunch on vacation with my boyfriend second was by myself on lunch time and yes decoration there make me happy to sit and have a nice dinner with my boyfriend  And this what we ordered.  -Chicken Tom kha soup this time we ordered a bowl instead of hot pot big one like first time we ordered spicy level 10 I ordered speak Thai tell them make it spicy as much as possible like Thai people eat soup come out in good size bowl you can share 2 people we order lot of other food so we decided order a bowl hot pot it's not too big tho if you are a big fan of soup this time soup was so good spicy was perfect for us  Chicken wing appetizer my boyfriend big fan of chicken wings I'm not that excited when it comes to Thai chicken wings I'm more like chicken wings American style chicken wings was not too bad my favorite part is they have lemongrass and some Thai ingredients deep fried on top on chicken wings make aromatic special scent for Thai food and feel like home :) Entrees we had Chu Chee Salmon and Hell curry we ordered spicy same level like soup food came out look nice by the way this is first time I see they called hell curry most Thai restaurant called jungle curry if you are curious it's a curry without coconut milk so coconut milk makes curry creamier sweetener but this curry strong taste of chilly curry was very strong spicy we ordered with beef I would say it was very good for jungle curry compared to anywhere I had before in US but not as good as Thailand back home Chuchee Salmon was creamy and good spicy.  Desserts we had sweet sticky rice with coconut ice cream this was highlight of the night so good we actually come back again to order only this for to go.   So I give 4 stars cause I like decoration of restaurant look so clean inside food total it was ok some dishes it was good but you have to make sure with server what you like like last time that I ordered very spicy Thai style I even speak Thai they gave me fish sauce with chilies ( it's common thing for Thai people to add salty and spicy yum!) and food come out like I want I will go back for sure :)"}
{"text":"This place is so nice inside and the service is great! We ordered pad Thai with chicken and the panan curry, it was delishishness on a plate!!!"}
{"text":"Establishment is extremely clean to include the restrooms, staff are very friendly and on top of things. Fully recommend this restaurant.  Oh...and they have a full bar too."}
{"text":"Atmosphere feels intimate which is common in Thai food. I have been here many times over the past few years. I REALLY enjoy the catfish curry. Wasn't too impressed with the pad Thai though. Brought my 3 brothers here to try Thai food for the first time.... That can be picky at times. They loved it!   The only suggestion I would make is for the staff to smile. Maybe they were having a rough day or something but the past couple of times I have been in, the staff look grumpy :("}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas. This place also has excellent service. My favorite dishes are the papaya salad and the Chicken Panang."}
{"text":"Ordered: pad see ew, panang chicken, and pork larb - portion sizes were disappointing.  Don't know why all the good reviews...service wasn't that good either.  We won't be back - there are a lot of other Thai places I like to go to that give you more for your money and better taste."}
{"text":"Initially, I was impressed by how nicely decorated and clean the restaurant looked. It's definitely one of the fancier looking Thai restaurants I've been to in Henderson but it also is one of the more expensive ones.   The regular menu seemed kind of pricy but I got the pad thai lunch deal for $8 which came with either soup and salad/fried wonton. The soup of the day was chicken soup filled with some rice which might seem a bit weird - I didn't mind the rice myself but I know some friends who did. The lunch portions were on the smaller side and the Pad Thai itself was just mediocre. Nothing about it really stood out to me but it was passable enough.   I came with about 25 friends and the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed at first. What was nice was that they were willing to split the bill for each individual so that saved us lots of time in the end!  Overall, my experience here was alright but I don't think I'll be back since there's tastier, cheaper Thai lunch deals around the area!"}
{"text":"We tried the other location not even knowing there was a Pin Kao by us!   The food was super yummy and authentic and the green papaya salad was on point! I love how they always have it available pretty much and can add grilled or dry shrimp! We shared the chicken pad Thai and chicken gyoza and all of that was gone between the two of us!   The servers were all very friendly and attentive even work a full house of customers!   The other reviews said so-so things about the curry but we usually stick to noodle dishes and salads and appetizers - we have yet to not be happy!   We even saw a full drink menu we haven't tapped into yet."}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended and I can see why now!   Service: the servers were very friendly and broke down the spice ranges (super important) and specials of the day.  Food: we tried the chef special house Thai wings, papaya salad (a favorite of mine), and shared chicken pad Thai to compare to our favorite back home. ALL plates were wiped clean to say the least! I loved the crunch and sauce on the wings and the pad Thai had  great sauce and flavor. The papaya salad was spiced perfectly and super fresh and delicious.  We had hot sake for only $8 and it kept is warm on a chilly night!  We know where to come back for prime time Thai!"}
{"text":"Have been there many times and is always so consistent. Great food, very nice staff. I usually get the same thing -Seafood Pad Thai. So yummy."}
{"text":"Their Tom Yum Soup is probably one of the best soups I've had in a while. My only critique would be the hot pot it comes it. The ladle size and the shape of the hot pot makes its difficult to scoop out the soup."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from here last night. Took way to long for the order. quoted 40 min. Then I asked if they could do any better then 40 min and so they said 30 min. That is a little better but still seems long for a take-out.  Food was just ok. I still feel like Archis is my Favorite in Vegas. Dont think I will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  Now that the weather is changing they have outside seating which I'll try next time.  It's a little pricey for dinner, in my opinion, with most meals being around $20 and not including anything but the meal and white rice.  Their decor is very authentic with lots of cabinetry work which is interesting to look at.  I was surprised at how many people where there on a Tuesday night around 7 pm.  Parking was a pain in the butt, I drove around for a bit before I found a spot.  We started with the curry puff fried dough awesome goodness!  It was very tasty!  My friend got the Basil Steak and Noodles spice level 8, it was so spicy I barely could eat it. He was sweating and didn't finish it all, I think he was unable to b/c of the heat, but he's a dude so he would never outwardly admit defeat!  I got the Shrimp and Scallops in Garlic Sauce on the advice of the waiter.  Presentation was very nice and it did have a garlic flavor but I felt the dish lacked some depth to it, every bite was essentially the same.  The scallops were mushy and undercooked, they definitely were frozen prior, I picked them out [see pix]. I've had curry there before and it was pretty good, so I think next time I'll stick w/ that.  Our waiter had too many tables. He was running around trying to service them all but it was next to impossible. And of course they were all spaced out.  We waited for drinks, we waited for food, we waited on him to wait on other tables, I even noticed other tables were waiting on him to wait on other tables.  Couple of drinks, 2 dishes, 1 app, bill was ~$75 with tip"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to this location, but I was craving Tom Yum soup and decided to place a to-go order.  Placing an order was fairly easy and the cashier was very friendly. I came 20 minutes later to pick up my yellow curry with beef and tom yum soup with chicken and it was ready on the counter. I got home and noticed there was barely any meat or veggies in the yellow curry, it probably didn't even fill up half of the container it came it. The tom yum soup was very watered down. It barely had any taste to it and was almost clear with some dry pieces of chicken, a few tomatoes, and mushrooms floating on top.  The soup at the Eastern location tastes a lot better and isn't watered down. I haven't tried their other dishes at this location, but if you're going to order tom yum soup - I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a surprise, I have driven past many times and never thought to go in well that was a mistake. Went with two others and every ones food was excellent service was the best I've hade in a long time and the price for the quality was spot on. Can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Great Thai food and consistently good.  We've been a fan of this restaurant for several years and it helps that they also deliver!!    Some of our favorites: Pork Larb Beef Nam Tok Green Curry Chicken Pad Thai Tom Yum Kung Pao Chicken (Thai Style) different from the usual Chinese style but oh so delicious Egg Plant with Pork  At times they could stand to be a little friendlier but it's not enough to deter us from eating here."}
{"text":"Every year we travel to Vegas/Summerlin for a Lacrosse tournament.  We have made a point of eating here for the past 3 years.  I have neer been disappointed.  The restaurant is quaint.  Its in a strip type complex.  The wait staff have always been spot on.  I have ordered the Kung pao, crab rangoon, and Pad Thai. It has been really a treat.  highly recommend."}
{"text":"By far the best thai food in town. The food is amazing the shrimp pad thai and the pineapple fried rice are a must try, and after your meal is finished you get complimentary orange slices to cleanse your pallet."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical about sushi in St George, even after reading good reviews. Very glad we tried this spot though, as the rolls were some of the best we've had in awhile. Can't remember what we ordered but each roll was a good size and had a good ratio of rice/fish. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai food in Las Vegas! Love the food and I am always impressed with the service! The pad thai is delicious and the crab friend rice is TO DIE FOR. I've always been a fan of Quality ingredients and decent portions; five stars."}
{"text":"This is our go to Thai restaurant whenever we've been away from home and had visited Thai restaurants in other cities. The flavor is what we are used to and we usually get the same entrees which include. Tom Yum soup with shrimp, Pad woo sen,  Beef basil, Pork Larb, Thai beef salad, and spring rolls. We've ordered other entrees, but these are the ones that we usually include in our order. We get it at spicy level 7, sometimes a 5 for my daughter. The spice level is usually what we can count on to be pretty consistent. Since my husband has been to Thailand a few times, he knows what Thai hot is, and most restaurants don't usually serve it that way for us Americans. I am sure a level 7 would be much hotter in Thailand. But we rather enjoy the food than be sweating it out and having a runny nose from the heat! Plus our insides would thank us!  This past visit though, the spice levels got mixed up somehow. The Tom Yum soup was not spicy at all. Hubby had to add more of the base that we keep in the fridge at home for when he makes his own. And the rest of the entrees seemed to be at a level 5, except for the larb which my daughter eats, seemed to be spicier. Not sure if they have a new cook, but its been months since we've been able to order from here. The flavors are still there, just the spice level was off.   I love how they get the beef so ground up in the Beef basil. Other restaurants use thin slices of beef, which I like too, but I like the ground better somehow."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this location. We ordered. two lunch specials, pad thai and red curry with chicken. The curry sauce was outstanding in flavor. We loved the menu and can't wait to return to sample duck dishes and the mango salad."}
{"text":"The food is great but their customer service is abysmal. I ordered takeout for my family (2 dinner sized curries), and they gave me one small rice to go with it. When I asked for an additional rice, they said it would be $5.00. Seriously? Five bucks for literally a half cup of rice? I just went home and made my own rice in my own rice cooker.   I've been going here for years and it seems that lately the service has been lacking. When I pay $30 for dinner, I shouldn't have to go home and make my own rice.   Also, it just seems silly to skimp on rice. A portion of white rice costs about 30 cents. So they're saving 30 cents, but they've lost my business. There are plenty of other Thai places in the area."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and going to Vegas I usually stop by the same place. I wanted to try something different so my friend took me here.   There are a few items I usually order when I try Thai. I usually get the Pad Thai and some green curry chicken. Pad Thai was ok. Didn't have the abundance of flavor that I get at other places.   The green curry chicken was good. I got it at a pretty medium spice level and it went good with rice. The sauce was pretty good offering a creamy taste that went well with the chicken.   This place isn't bad. It gets super busy so be sure to come early to avoid lines!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. Got the pumpkin curry with shrimp. Not sure the shrimp are worth the price but I thought the food was good and the service was good. Not sure if I'll return, but would recommend it...worth a try!"}
{"text":"Food mostly great, service not so wonderful.  I visited here one evening with a companion.  We had never been here before so we joked as we approached the door about how we'd probably be stared at as we walked in, dressed as we were in t-shirts and casual pants.  When we opened the door, BAM - everyone was indeed staring!  That's because the entertainment -a woman playing a stringed instrument and singing-  was seated on a bench in the lobby right in front of the doors, commanding everyone's attention.  This was a rather disconcerting \"welcome\" that had us laughing later at our table.   I feared that the place would be way too expensive, given the decor and the entertainment, which included a Thai dancer, but the meals were moderately priced, around $10 to $15.  The specials, however, were in the $20 range, and special bar drinks were $10.  I had the Tom Ka Khai for an appetizer, and it was delicious, with layers of interesting flavors. It wasn't as polished, nor as pretty, as the Lotus of Siam's version, but very, very good.  My companion raved over it, as well as over her chicken satay appetizer which was very, very tasty and succulent. MMMM!   She also enjoyed a martini, which was very prettily attired in a flower and a slice of citrus, and sprinkled with what appeared to be a little shaved ice.  My friend ordered the red curry with shrimp, and when it arrived she knew at once that the shrimp was overcooked by its appearance. It was indeed very white and a bit rubbery.  My masaman was quite tasty, though (my companion loved it as well), although a couple of the potato chunks were a tad undercooked. I enjoyed the meal quite a bit overall.    Being who she is, she set her plate aside in the hope that she would be able to get a different dish instead, otherwise she would ask for it to be boxed to take home.  When the waitress  caught her eye my friend told her that she felt her dish wasn't flavorful and that the shrimp was overcooked, but that she loved everything else she had tasted.  The waitress immediately offered to substitute another meal, which my friend accepted.  The waitress then brought over the manager.  Manager asks how meal was.  Friend repeats story. Manager offers substitute. Friend accepts.  So... some time goes by and no waitress.  The manager wanders by and my friend asks her if the waitress will be coming back. The manager says the waitress is busy with another customer.  She looks towards the back of the restaurant and then has a second thought, and offers to take the order herself. My friend orders the chicken fried rice.  The order arrived but the waitress was now quite subdued.  I didn't make much of it (I hate conflict- I usually don't even send meals back) but I did notice that she never came back to check on us, didn't have a smile for us when she walked by, and was showing that she wasn't happy with us.  Since my friend was quite polite about the whole thing and there had been no obvious rancor I was a little surprised about the waitress' change of demeanor and lack of good service.  Luckily other staff were very friendly and handled duties. I was able to get a Coke from the bartender when he came to ask if my companion wanted another martini.  The strangest thing was when I got the check. The waitress just plopped the check on the table and, chin up, whipped away from us so quickly it startled me.  I usually don't notice subtle displeasure, but this was over-the-top rude, and made my friend angry enough to refuse to leave a tip.  (Me being a wimp I would have left her maybe 10%).  Sigh.... So, the food was very flavorful except for the shrimp dish and a couple of undercooked potatoes, but I really enjoyed the flavors. The live Thai entertainment created an interesting cultural atmosphere. I found the restaurant to be clean, nicely designed and comfortable. I thought everyone was pleasant except for our waitress during the last half of the meal. I'd give the place a 3.5 to a 4, but my companion does not condone unprofessionalism when one pays for a service, so she would give it a 2, so I'm rounding my score to a 3.  Both of us might be willing to try this place again, just based on the fact that the food that we did like was awesome, and the staff, other than our waitress, were friendly and professional.  Personally, I think most people would have a good experience here despite my own adventure."}
{"text":"I am always skeptical when I visit a Thai place because I love massaman (mussaman, etc.) and find very uneven results across the Thai restaurant landscape. I've had salty-as-hell massaman, nearly-raw massaman, and flavorless massaman.  I gave this a try.  This was Very Good Massaman. The potatoes were actually cooked through. The shrimp still had the tails on them, which I hate, but they were good. The sauce was tasty (though somewhat  reminiscent of tomato bisque soup). I really enjoyed that dish.  The decor was pleasant- wood everywhere, not overly crowded with tables. The floor didn't look as if it had been swept for a couple of days, though (sorry, Pin Kaow- that evening sun shows everything on a smooth shiny surface!)  I tried the rice and coconut ice cream for dessert and was not impressed with the rice, as it was gummy.  I'll come back for more more massaman, but no dessert for me."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. We get the spicy mint chicken, sometimes spicy mint noodles and the pad thai every time. Awesome. I want to try some new things, but I am so addicted to the spicy mint chicken it haunts my dreams."}
{"text":"Pink Cow?  ...no Pin Kaow...    LOVE this place!!    We've recently ventured out of our normal order of Pad Thai with shrimp, spicy #5 and Yellow curry with chicken, spicy #5...   We added on spring rolls, vegetable fried rice and FRIED ICE CREAMMMMM!!  So our normal bill of about $20 has increased to $40, but WHO CARES, when the food this THAT good = consistently every time, might I add...  It's more than worth it!!  So our waist line might not be thanking us, but there's more to life than always thinking skinny!  ...just workout harder!!  When you're craving Thai food, this is a great go-to restaurant where you'll know your craving WILL be satisfied!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic but they charge for EVERYTHING! They charged me an additional $2.00 to order my chow mein with carrots instead of bean sprouts which I thought was a bit much for a sliced carrot."}
{"text":"Kind of crappy location, but besides that Pin Kaow is the best thai I have found in Las Vegas.  My favoriter dish here is the chilli mint noodle with white rice, and the fried bananas with coconut ice cream. Has yet to dissapoint me. Service is always supurb and this place is a hole in the wall that is not usually crowded.  Also the servers wear authentic Thai dress which I think it pretty cool. Overall excellent place."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Las Vegas, we always try to stop by this place for dinner. Our favorite dishes include grilled shrimp salad, crying tiger and shrimp fried rice."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is great!  First few times the portions were big, spice level on point and very happy with the service.  I've even gotten takeout, just as fresh. However this time it gets 4 stars because the combo friend rice we got had no shrimp (ordered two), one came with, the other Not.  They got my spice level way wrong. I don't mind less spice because then you can add to it. But making it so hot it burns my stomach, redo please.  Their Thai tea is the BOMB!!!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Let me first disclose that I don't really eat Thai food, mostly because it is full of sugar and I just don't have an adventurous palate outside of Pad Thai.   I also absolutely hate the flavor of curries.  And yes, I won't eat Indian food or other related food either.  Sorry don't hate me yelpers!  But this low review is mainly because this restaurant seems to have problems with just cooking basics.  I don't know why but I was in the mood for good pad thai outside of Chinese delivery, and Pin Kaow 3 delivers to my area after 5pm.  So I got for myself and my husband the following:    -Shrimp and Tofu Pad Thai  -Stuffed Chicken Wings  -Beef Jerky (One sun beef) -Mee krob -Beef noodle soup  The pad thai and beef jerky were very good and cooked well.  My husband enjoyed the soup.  However, the stuffed chicken wings were overcooked so much they were practically petrified.  When I bit into one, I couldn't tell which was chicken and which was the stuffing, so I threw it away.  Really awful!  The Mee krob was all sweetness and no counterbalance of acid, and hardly any protein.  It was just too overwhelming so I also threw it away.  I don't think I'd order delivery again but I would do take-out just for the pad thai."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai restaurant -- my son will come from So. Cal. to eat here.  The ambience is good and the food is amazing.  Try the various curries for a real treat."}
{"text":"Been here many times. We haven't been in about 3-4 yrs. came back to visit family in Vegas. We always come with quite a bit of people (14) immediate family members. The food hasn't changed nor the service. Everything is always good here."}
{"text":"Love the hell curry.  Spicy and low fat compared to other curries.  The wonton soup is really good. The sweet and sour tofu is perfect for my vegetarian. We will be back."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow has been my favorite restaurant for years, so I was really hoping some of the recent bad reviews were maybe on a bad day or were wrong. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The service was awful! Everything took forever, and it wasn't even busy. They didn't bring the sauce out with our crab rangoons, and we had to practically chase down a waitress to get some. Our pineapple fried rice literally had 2 pieces of shrimp, and no pineapple! They didn't even bring us oranges at the end of the meal. The only good thing was the perfect yellow curry and soup."}
{"text":"Love Pin Kaow.  We moved to California in 2009 and miss a good inexpensive Thai restaurant in the Murrieta area.  We visited Pin Kaow multiple times and never had a bad experience.  Pad Thai, crab rangoons, curry, sticky rice were our regular orders there and we always got the same, great, consistent food.  We were recommended to go there by friends and have sent many referrals there of our own."}
{"text":"Incredible food, presentation and great sweet sticky rice. My go to place for an elegant thai dinning experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best pad see ew in vegas. Customer service is great, even when it's packed."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and came out quickly but the attention to our table was a little slow.  I had the Red Curry lunch special with shrimp and my friend had pad Thai."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! I've been to Thailand and I love the food here very good and very close to the true flavors you would find in the homeland! Highly recommended and always packed! They offer daily specials and happy hour specials. I eat here every time I'm in Las Vegas. I can't get enough of this wonderful restaurant!  Xrxy! (Delicious!) Marshana"}
{"text":"The food here is ok. The Pad Thai wasn't as great as the other Thai places I've had in Henderson. I prefer eating at Bangkok Orchid or Bangkok 9. The portions weren't that big either. I probably would not go back here again. The prices are also too high for the quality and portions that you get at this place compared to others. Nice ambiance though."}
{"text":"My sister was visiting from the east coast and we decided to have dinner here on March 30th and we were blown away, but (not literally). I have been eyeing this restaurant for quite some time and always a little leery, due to its location. On the suggestion of my daughter, since she knows I'm a little picky, we said \"let's try it\". Sooooo happy that we did. What a pleasant surprise when we walked into the dining room! A beautiful atmosphere...terrific service...oh!, and the food was great. We had Salmon Padthai and Duck Fried Rice. Yes, I'm going back. Would like to try the lunch menu.   Thanks for a surprisingly wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Just had our son's dedication ceremony lunch here and they did really well at accommodating 18 people including 3 toddlers and two kids. The food was amazing (like Lotus of Siam amazing) and since I preordered the food the day before, they had our food out quickly.  I spoke to Sue over the phone and she was extremely helpful in helping me determine how many portions to purchase for a group of my size. Some of my favorite dishes were the beef jerky, the crispy fried rice, the Tom kha soup, the mango salad, the duck curry, the basil shrimp, the pad see ew, and the garlic sea bass...  They way they set up the tables also made it easy for our entire party to interact and there was still a lot of room for other patrons to sit and not be distracted by us. The ambiance is legit Thai woodwork and super clean."}
{"text":"I love this place. Service is great & food is authentic and delicious. Not to mention they have their liquor license too."}
{"text":"Friday night, last minute texts... Let's hit Pin Kaow since we've never been. 8:30, see you there.  We opted to sit on the patio and take advantage of the breezy, cooler summer night and, because of that choice, were seated right away. Bonus!  Water was brought out immediately and our table was dressed for three. The waitress and busser were friendly and helpful, asking if it was our first visit and making recommendations based on what we liked from other places/cuisines.  - Curry puffs - Edamame - Thom Ka Koong - Panang curry (shrimp) - Pad thai (chicken) - Garlic (pork)  The puffs were good and reminded me of an Indian samosa (unsurprising, as I believe it's a regional thing). The one part I would have liked to be different was that it have more of a thai flair to it... a twist on the spice, or a sauce? Really tasty, but I wanted something with more curry and more puff.  The edamame was, well, edamame. Needed salt. Still, it was fresh and hot (temperature) and good.  The Thom Ka Koong (galangal, shrimp) soup was tasty. The downside was that I asked for a 7 out of 10 on the spice request (never having been there, I didn't want to go too far without knowing how heavy handed they were)... and what I got was more like a 4-ish. Good soup, bummer on the spice factor. I really think it would have made it pop that much more for me.  The pad thai was about what I expected, plentiful, and the protein was super tender. Not very spicy, but it wasn't mine to order. For the 3 or 4 she requested, it was done right. Decent dish.  The panang was very good. I could have used more spice (again I asked for a 7, got a 4ish), and I would have liked more of the curry sauce for the amount of shrimp and veggies I was given. Don't take away anything, but definitely give more of what I am ordering. Flavors were spot on, texture was perfect, and it was well put together overall.  The garlic pork was beyond tender, heavy on the garlic (yay!) and about the 4-5 spice level he ordered. The veggies were crisp or tender as appropriate and the whole dish was executed well. Definitely some \"gotta try this\" moments as we passed around forks and shared.  We opted out of dessert and they brought us some really fresh (and creatively presented) cut oranges and other fruit as a refresher. Juicy, fresh, cooling. Perfect.  All that food, and a bottle of wine, and I think it was maybe $100 for the three of us? We were quite happy with what we ate, the service, and the price tag. Not the best in town, but for what it is? Totally A-OK and definitely worth repeating. (And, they deliver? Hmmmm...)"}
{"text":"The location is nice, food is good but the service was FAR from it. From the second my  girlfriend and I sat down we were force fed the menu as if the staff could not wait to get us back out the door. I informed them that we were looking to have a nice relaxing evening which they proceeded to hover from a distance. After 4 courses, cocktail wine and $160.00 later we asked for dessert which they quickly informed us that the kitchen was closed. Truly unfortunate being that we live directly around the corner. Fortunately for us they are not the only game in town. Galanga, Archies andLotus of Siam for instance blow their doors off. Good luck to you Pin Kaow!!!"}
{"text":"I would absolutely give this place a better review because the food is amazing! However the service falls flat in that department. Took prob 6-7 minutes before our server came to table to which you would think a drink order would be taken. But not in this circumstance. She came over and asked what we wanted to eat. I proceeded to give her out drink order first along with appetizer choices. She then brought our drinks and we placed out entrees. Our appetizers came out separate and rather fast. Our entrees on the other hand took nearly 30 minutes. The entire time as we waited we never had a server come to table nor a manager. Thankfully our busser was good and able to refill our drinks and take out dirty plates away. Once our food came our server never even came to check to see if everything was ok and to our liking or if we needed anything else. Had she we would have order some veggies we had forgot to order. Once we finished and got Togo boxes we were super excited for dessert which was really why we went. But nope. After waiting almost 10 minutes to get anyone's attention she finally came to ask if we were ready for our check never even offering dessert. By this point we were so aggravated by the service we felt it better to go find dessert elsewhere and leave. I have always been given a hard time because being a GM and working in this industry for 10+years I always still tip at least 15% regardless of how bad service was. And tonight for the first time ever I didn't tip because the only person who deserved anything was the busser and he wasn't there when we went to leave. We couldn't even get a manager to ever make eye contact or approach us. Service overall and hospitality was a fail. Kitchen...great job! Food was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Based upon a recommendation and being indecisive as to where to eat on a Friday night, we decided to give Pin Kaow a try. The Best of LV award posted provided some initial comfort as to our decision. The ambiance is good but I would probably prefer takeout in the future. The service is okay but a number of different people worked the table including three to process our payment? The server seemed a little irritable or put out. I mean I only needed a new fork. As for the food, I thought the Crab Rangoon appetizer tasted like cream cheese only...wheres the crab? The Pad Thai with shrimp, medium and Yellow Curry with chicken medium were good. I will return to the Kaow for the curry...takeout."}
{"text":"Cashew Chicken is perfect- add pineapple (though the upcharge is unreasonable and too much $2 for fruit) it's well worth the sweet balance with the spice!  The tom yum soup is also delicious."}
{"text":"Great Food!!  Very authentic Thai, I was surprised since I come from Hollywood which has Thai town, I was totally expecting the disappointment of Americanized wannabe Thai food.  This place had it all, great food, atmosphere and great service!  Will definitely eat here again if I go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good, reasonably price Thai food-pin know is where you should check out! I've been going there for years and they continue to be consistent with their menu. I'm always pleased leaving the restaurant. If you're a fried rice lover check out the pineapple fried rice. It's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Thai food is one cuisine that I never get tired of and Vegas has lots of spots to go to when nothing else sounds good.  This Pin Kaow has been a mainstay in my rotation since I used to live close by for years, even before I started Yelping.   It may not look like much on the outside since the restaurant is in a non-descript shopping plaza on the corner of Lake Mead and Rainbow.  Once you enter, though, you will find yourselves in an inviting atmosphere with wooden walls and accents throughout, as well as Thai d√©cor.  It does get busy at night, but I've been lucky enough to not have had to wait for a table yet, usually arriving around 6:00pm.   My favorites are their Mango Salad with fried tofu, cilantro, cashews, red onions, and Thai lime sauce.  This is a refreshing dish that helps you cool off in the summer time.  I also like their Pad Thai as well as their Satay, either the beef or the chicken.  Service is attentive and the food is always satisfying.  Even though I no longer live near this location, I'd still make the drive to eat here."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai restaurant located on rainbow and lake mead. I don't usually eat out Thai food only once in awhile occasions. This Thai cuisine is really brings the taste out for their curry. I always get a 4 out of 10 for my spices. I need to tell them next time to serve my food all at once instead of one by one which gets me full very easily. Giving this place a positive review Becuase the food was excellent."}
{"text":"The problem with Pin Kaow 3 is mostly one of inconsistency--the hallmark of a mediocre restaurant. I've had one 2-star dinner, one 3-star dinner and one 1-star dinner at Pin Kaow 3, all having ordered the same exact meal, tofu panang. This time around, after an astoundingly bad 1-star dinner, I felt compelled to put in my two cents and warn the internet.  I've had very, very good panang curries via Archie's on the west side and Komol on E. Sahara Avenue. It's my favorite Thai dish and I've cultivated a pretty discerning taste for it done right. Pin Kaow 3 can't seem to do much right here. This time around, the green beans in the panang were severely undercooked; the curry sauce almost nonexistent on top of being watery, bland and flavorless (we requested a level \"5\" on the 1-10 heat scale and got nothing near medium heat); not to mention the fact that we had to pay an extra $2 to have broccoli, mushrooms and bamboo shoots added to the meal. For an extra $2 worth of vegetables (which places like Komol load your plate with happily, at $8.95 a plate for tofu & veggie panang), Pin Kaow delivers a mediocre, overpriced ($12.95 for about a cup and a 1/2 of curry) dish--not to mention the fact that your pricey $2 veggies consist of about two stalks of broccoli, four small mushrooms and a some shards of bamboo shoots. Very disappointing. I'm done giving chances to a restaurant that--no matter how convenient the location--can't deliver consistently good, reasonably priced Thai. There are too many other restaurants that can and do, easily."}
{"text":"Service and food was great....and the price was amazingly cheap during the lunch hours.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Atmosphere and staff are great! Everyone was extremely nice and attentive.  Food was fantastic.  I recommend:  Appetizers -  Chicken Satay- so great!  Pot stickers - yummy!   Entrees- Chicken Pad Thai Duck Curry   Dessert -  Sticky rice with mango Thai Tea Creme Brule"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere but didn't love the food. I wasn't very impressed with the Tom Yum soup here compared to places I have had this soup from. Food was a bit pricey for its location & quality. Wouldn't be my first choice to come for Thai cusine."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, but it was a bit pricey for the portion size. I had takeout and it was not your standard square Styrofoam container, it was a much nicer (but half the size) black plastic rectangular container. For two of those (one with chili fried rice and the other with chicken pad Thai) and an order of 4 egg rolls, it was $30. I wasn't disappointed with the food, just wish there was more of it."}
{"text":"My family and I love the tumyum soup, pad Thai, and lemon chicken. We go here a lot and the service here is great, as well as the food"}
{"text":"Ehhhh... This place is clean and nice but food is mediocre at best. The Thai food here does not seem authentic. We ordered the prawns, crying tiger and the Tom Kha gai soup. Food took almost 30 mins to come out and no one came to refill our waters, had to flag someone down. The prawns were barely crispy and reminded me of those breaded things you can get in the frozen food section with some sauce on it. I ordered the crying tiger (grilled steak) medium rare and it came out well done... way to ruin a piece of meat. To be honest, the good reviews here look like they come from non Asians who are not used to Asian food. There are many choices for Thai food in this area so I will not be back here."}
{"text":"Had the pumpkin curry and Nam Kao Tod today.... VERY VERY yummy!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food: chicken pad thai and chicken panang curry both medium spicy (level 5 out of 10). Very tasty and I like that the curry came with a serving of rice and that you didn't have to order it separately. I was disappointed that the pad thai did not come with the traditional wedge of lime or lemon to squirt over it. This is an important detail!   Ambiance: authentic Thai wooden decor and staff.   Service: attentive.   Will be back to try more dishes next time."}
{"text":"Well as I am sure all of you know there are some really good Thai restaurants and there are some others that should be shut down immediately. Pin Kaow is a great Thai restaurant. Now, I pretty much always get the same thing whenever I get Thai, Yellow Chicken Curry. It was excellent here. The interior of the restaurant is nicer than most other strip mall Thai places I have been to and it was fairly busy when I was there midday. This to me is a good indicator that a lot people enjoy this restaurant as much as I did. It wasn't too spicy and I usually go medium. Some places medium can make you sweat so don't be afraid to get a little aggressive on how hot you want your food here. Man..I'm hungry again."}
{"text":"I came in for a quick lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty slow. I was seated right away and my food came out pretty quick. I ordered their Pad Kee Mao with beef medium spicy and it was okay. I like that they served it exactly as the description because I've been to some places that don't but it's also kind of weird that they served it over a bed of lettuce. Probably the second Thai restaurant I've been to since living in Vegas that did that."}
{"text":"Local Thai restaurant is a standout.  Great daily specials, diverse menu, gracious service and relaxing ambience makes this place a culinary experience.  Drinks and Rieslings complement the 1-10 option on the mouthwatering dishes.  Appetizers, seafood, tofu, curries eggplant, noodles, desserts-all delicious.  Love the drunken seafood chow mein, duck curry and eggplant with tofu.  Easy parking and spacious inside."}
{"text":"I have been to this location so many time, finally took some time to write the review. i love thai food and this place has good thai food. Will keep on coming."}
{"text":"So this is my FIRST negative review ever. That is how bad it was. My sister and I were in the neighborhood and wanted Thai food. After reading some great reviews on yelp we thought Pin Kaow would be a good choice...NOT! This place is a complete JOKE!  1st of all food is totally overpriced. I ordered Thai beef salad and Chicken Satay, they came out first. My sister also ordered Garlic Beef, it came almost  45 mins later...really? 45 mins? The beef was totally chewy and the Chicken Satay was pink on the inside. I was already done eating by the time her food came to the table. We thought they had just forgotten. The restaurant was not busy at all...(well now I know why).  The server DID NOT check on us at all. They just dropped off the food and walked away. When the lady finally came over to ask us how we were doing she didn't even bother to clear any of the empty plates or refill the water. There is a serious miscommunication between the servers. One lady asked us if we wanted to order drinks when we first got seated, and 2 seconds later another came to ask the same question. Then when we asked for the check same thing one lady said do you want dessert then a guy came to ask the same question a minute later. It also took the guy an additional 15 mins to return with the change from the bill.   If you are around this area and want Thai food save yourself and GO TO THAI HOUSE DOWN THE STREET!"}
{"text":"I'm Thai. I love the food here and the outside dinning is so so beautiful. The larb is great. I asked for galanga to be added in and they did this for me. This place is beautiful."}
{"text":"Very surprised with the interior. ..looks nothing like the strip mall its in. All wood paneling,  booths etc...with a very Thai feel. Food was very good. The chefs special chicken wings with thai chili sauce were delicious. Husband got ginger chicken very spicy (so I didnt have any) and said it was very good. I had the bbq spare ribs and they were also great. Very hearty portion size and the sauce was yummy. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant has the yummiest lunch specials.  Today I had the Pork Pad Thai that had rice noodles sauteed with bean sprouts, green onion, egg and crushed peanuts in a Thai special recipe.  The special came with a wonderful cucumber soup and egg roll.  I especially like their sweet and sour sauce.  The service is outstanding and the atmosphere is very relaxing."}
{"text":"Crab fried rice, pad soon sen, and pad see you were excellent. But I still don't understand why Thai food is so pricey in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"lots of customers today. We ordered the lunch specials. The lady manager took our orders. We asked for the Pad Thai, Basil chicken and Red curry beef. the manager asked how spicy from 1 to 10, one said 5, another said six, I wanted mine hot then changed my mind so everyone can share. She said, perhaps you should consider Ala cart or the dinner menu for larger portions.  Her suggestion didn't make sense, more chili or less chili...  \"the lunch portion is fine, can we have the chili tray so we can adjust the taste ourselves later\"?  When the food came, my red curry arrived with a pinch of beef. Where's the BEEF? The pad thai had one spoonful of chicken, my red curry had one beef the size of a teaspoon, on a red curry soup,  the Basil chicken bowl was FILLED with CHICKEN. WHAT THE ****. DO NOT EVER COME BACK FOR LUNCH."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner, have come in for drinks and snacks before and very pleased. The best part of the dinner was dessert - mangos are in season and the sticky rice was yummy!"}
{"text":"I just went here this afternoon to try the lunch special pad thai and...it was great! I called to pick it up and it took about 15 minutes to be ready. I got the beef thai, chicken pad thai, and a small rice. The total was about $19. The portion was decent and the lunch specials came with a wonton and an egg roll. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"My friend from OC happened to be in Vegas visiting a friend, and I happened to be visiting too, so we decided to get together for dinner. Being very familiar with the area since she visits very regularly, and her friend lives nearby this strip mall, she highly recommended this Thai restaurant. I almost never leave the strip unless my friends are a little more adventurous so it's great that someone familiar knows where to eat around here.  I left it to her to drive me here, which was about 4-5 miles away from the strip. There were lots of familiar restaurants located in this strip mall too, which was expansive and has lots of parking available.  Upon entering, you are wow's at the authenticity of the Thai decor which was warm, cozy, and inviting. We were guided to a booth by a friendly hostess, and the server came over to help us out with the menu right away. Being familiar with Thai food, but not being extremely hungry, we decided not to order too much, but the many choices on the menu, we just had to try as much as we could.....off the happy hour menu as well as the regular menu. We ordered the Fish Cake, Crab Rangoon, and Chicken Satay, Shrimp Roll ....which are all appetizers, and the Pad Woon Sen clear noodles. The difficulty were the many absolutely yummy looking dishes to choose from, but we had to keep reminding ourselves that we weren't that hungry, and that we were only two people.  This Pad Woon Sen was my absolute favorite Thai noodle dish I've had outside of Thailand! It was cooked perfectly, ingredients, were fresh, and totally delicious.....very authentic and comparable to the best you can get in Thailand! I was really impressed....and I'm usually not easily impressed. My next favorite was the Chicken Satay. Big portions of tender chicken meat on the skewer, marinated and grilled to perfection! Again, easily one of the best satays I've had anywhere! The other appetizers were good, but were pretty typical happy hour appetizers.  We will definitely be back to try the other dishes here, which my friend has assured me are \"spectacular\"....!!!  Other than that, the service was good, friendly, and attentive. Great place, great food....ok, slightly pricey, but well worth it ....what else can you possibly want? :)"}
{"text":"Great Asian atmosphere to bring a date or the family. The food has awesome favors and really great presentation. Service is excellent, my ice tea never went dry. The food as popping hot  This is a great place to eat, enjoy the menu!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this was the best place that I've been to, but it was really good.  I had the pad see ew (stir fried flat rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and egg) with chicken and the BBQ Spare ribs.  The spare ribs were really soft and juicy.  The bbq sauce had a little sweetness to it, which I thought was good.  The pad see ew was good too, which is my favorite Thai dish.  It definitely didn't disappoint.    I also like the decor of this place.  It feels very authentic because the servers wear traditional wear.    Definitely a good place for Thai food.  I don't imagine that it gets any better in Vegas."}
{"text":"After quite a few failed attempts to get my boyfriend to enjoy thai food as much as I do, I finally found a place that he actually likes! Thank you Pin Kaow!  The atmosphere at this restaurant is really nice. We always sit on the patio/courtyard area and I'm sure this summer will try eating indoors too. But, it's sooo nice outside! Lots of lush greenery to make you almost believe you aren't in Vegas anymore.  The food is really yummy. We have tried the spicy mint chicken (I'm addicted now), the Pad Woon Sen with chicken, Tom Yum Kai soup and the thai chicken salad....all very good!"}
{"text":"YEN TA FO: that's where it's at.   I will definitely be coming here for lunch whenever I\"m in vegas for work.  Came upon this cute little place in a shopping plaza area and was hoping they had noodle soup of some type.  They sure did, and it met all expectations.   There's a sweetness to the broth but it's still salty at the same time, great taste.  I love seafood so I naturally got it with seafood. I do wish that the noodles was a different type but i love all noodles so can't complain too much. The surprising thing in the soup though was the vegetables.  I believe it was ong choy, which is my favorite vegetable ever and it's not something that is usually served unless you specifically order it so when I saw it, it was just heaven in a bowl.   Another great thing is that the prices are very reasonable.  I was full and didn't feel like I overpaid so I was really happy. Not to mention if you want a drink they have tons to choose from, they have a whole separate bar area! :)"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Minced chicken, pad siew, and stuffed chicken wing all very good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite thai restaurants in town. Ambiance was nice. Lighting was not too dark not too light. The noise level was average. Wait staff was very friendly but wish ours was a bit more attentive since there were occasions where I needed a refill on my water. Food came out fast, tried the basil beef for the first time. Delicious. Tried the coconut curry and loved the sauce and bits of coconut,  came in a coconut shell."}
{"text":"The food at this place is great. The authentic flavors and consistency in delivering has for those very same reasons kept this place on the map. I would highly recommend to order their soup selection, try them all they are all great. If you love spicy you might be a bit disappointed as their highest selection of spicy did not cut it for me a spicy lover. I will keep coming back. In order for me to give a five star rating, I would like to see a bit less wait time from the kitchen. The dod is worth the wait when they are busy but don't come on a rush."}
{"text":"OK, so living in Las Vegas has taken some getting used to.  Especially the whole strip mall thing, which means lack of character to the shopping areas.    So imagine my surprise when looking for a place to have dinner with out of town friends, that we pulled into a parking spot in front of Pin Kaow and walked through the doors and were transported into a beautifully elegant, dining experience.  Not only is the restaurant beautiful, the staff is friendly, attentive, dressed in Thai attire.  And the food... OH!  The food.  It's wonderfully delicious!  My party and I had assorted curries and appetizers and nothing disappointed.  My San Diego friend, who is very finicky, LOVED his duck curry and had it again when we returned 3 months later.  This is definitely a little ray of sunshine in the land of strip malls."}
{"text":"Love this place, affordable and delicious. I always order Tom Kha - my favorite."}
{"text":"Cleanliness: 5 Stars Everything from the front door to the area under the tables was clean and debri free. Uniforms were traditional, clean and pressed.   Hospitality: 5 stars Over the years I have done take out and dined in, both experiences were great. Orders were correct, and explanation of items on the menu were accurate and helpful.  Food: 5 Stars The portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and tasty.   Overall: I will continue to patronize this establishment. love it"}
{"text":"Very good food, especially the lunch specials...we usually have the Red Curry which is excellent, the Pad Thai Noodles are very good.  The prices have gone up a little but whose hasn't.  They are very friendly and the service is great.  Never a bad experience..."}
{"text":"I visited Pin Kaow at the South Rainbow location and have always been very pleased, however, I am not having similar experiences at the Lake Mead and Rainbow location. I have only placed pick up orders from N. Rainbow and the first time my masaman curry was barely edible. It was obvious that they forgot to add a very crucial spice. I thought I would give them a second chance tonight and just opened my crab rangoon and the sauce is missing. I must warn you; their food is delicious but if you are placing an order to pick up I strongly suggest ensuring that you are satisfied before driving away."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. From my experience, you cant go wrong at Pin Kaow.   The service is perfect. They seat you ASAP and the water glass of mine is constantly full. They check-up just enough so you feel remembered, but not pestered.   Food here is just like Grandma's :)   Cucumber salad and papaya salad (youre not supposed to eat the crabs, just suck on them for their saltiness, not too much of a fan) are good appetizers. If you're looking for soup rather than salad for appetizers, the Tom ga kai soup is my faveee, and they make it well here.  For entrees I usually get Red or Green Curry. Yummm. I have found that the red curry is spicier than green when ordered on the same scale.  My last visit, I stepped away from getting my usual curries, and got the ground chicken larb salad. It was just as I had expected, almost as good as grandma's ;]. I recommend this dish, I think people stay away from food that they don't know... but larb is ground meet of your choice. Thai basil and cilantro really dominate the dish, along with this it has the standards of onions, and fish sauce. With the ground meat, you put it in cabbage wraps.. mmm. So, you can call it a variant of lettuce wraps.   My only complaint is the lack of rice they give for the curry... There is so much broth for this and i like to have my curry and rice well proportioned, but they dont provide you enough... I know how the asians hate wasting!! But I dont think it would go to waste if they just gave another scoop.   I have tried tmy friend's pad thais, pad see ews, and other noodle dishes. I am not too fond of getting these here because I feel that I can get these in chinese take out!  My recent discovery is on Sunday nights they have traditional Thai music, which is relaxing, and dancing performances that are nice to watch. Stop by this place, despite the negative reviews.. try it for yourself:]"}
{"text":"Pin Kaow has always gone above and beyond when it comes to making it a real cultural experience with their food. All three locations are beautifully designed on the inside, and really contribute to the culture of the food and puts you \"in the mood\" to enjoy some great hospitality. This is one of those restaurants where I feel like I really *am* a part of the culture in that sitting. The scenery makes you feel like you're in a formal setting of a thai restaurant, although the restaurant itself is far from formal.   I was here several days ago. I usually go to the one that's by Lake Mead/I-95 since it's closer to my side of town, but I decided to venture out to the other two to see if the quality was just as good as the original establishment. I always order the Red Curry with chicken and bamboo shoots with extra rice; am absolutely *obsessed* with this, since you have your choice on a lot of the menu items to pick from 1-10 on level of spiciness.  Their menu has full of unique variety and flavor to choose from, and the service here is by far one of the best in Vegas. I would honestly say the service is just as great as the food itself, maybe even better! I've noticed the managers will stop by asking how your meal has gone, and everyone is more than willing to cater to what you need, and are very friendly. This is my favorite spot to take my friends when they are feeling adventurous with eating and need a change of scenery from the typical, boring restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I got the Chef's Special Pumpkin Curry with Chicken ($10.95). Very good curry sauce though a touch too sweet. Generous amount of Asian pumpkin chunks which were tasty. The chicken was very overcooked and chewy. I'd recommend this curry though.   Their spiciness scale (1-10) is conservative FYI. I got a #6 and it wasn't very spicy at all...I would have called it a 3 or 4. Service is good and the place is nice on the inside."}
{"text":"I got a bunch of take out here so I wouldn't have to cook during my busy week of tests. Portions were a good size and the food lasted me almost all week. Spiciness is on a 1-10 scale. I got 5's for the first 2 dishes, and I could have probably gotten a 7 and been ok.   1) Spicy basil beef- good flavor, but the meat was kind of dry 2) Spicy Eggplant with chicken - eggplant itself was awesome, definitely my favorite of all the dishes. however, the chicken was SUPER dry 3) Chicken Pad Thai - a bit greasy, and once again, dry chicken  Since I got all take out, I never tried the food fresh- I only had it after a zap in the microwave. For this reason I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, and contributing some of the dryness of the meat to the microwave. However, if the meat is this dry when the meal is served fresh, I would bump them down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"We really liked there Pork fried rice....The place is decorated very nice,great Staff....First time trying restaurant....We will be back"}
{"text":"Yelp lead us out of town business travelers here for Sunday lunch. We both decided to go simple and order Pad Thai. I at level 1 and with tofu and my colleague at level 7 with chicken. Skipped appetizers and drinks.   Food was wonderful and portion was great. Probably a bit more than I needed to eat but it was so good I got through most of it.   We were seated quickly. Service was prompt and courteous. Server checked on us a few times but not too much.   Overall a great experience. If I was from the area, could see it as a regular spot."}
{"text":"I love this pin kaow! the service is excellent and everyone there is just so nice and more than excited to strike up a conversation or answer your questions. the food is delicious. sooooo spicy! I'm a rebel when I get a 4.....my psycho mother gets 12's and is moving up on the scale (scale of 20 by the way). but give it a shot. everything is delicious and I recommend their Thai iced tea an the fried ice cream for dessert :)"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Nice little hidden Thai food restaurant. Very delicious and reasonably priced. If you like Curry, try the Avocado Curry from the special Chef's menu. The creamy Avocado matches the sauce perfectly!!! Delicious"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this elegantly decorated Thai restaurant by my optometrist friend for lunch after a routine eye exam, and generally liked what I ate.  But, although I ordered a bowl of Tom Kha Kai soup, I received instead Tom Yum Kai.  This was likely the result of a misheard communication by me, but I know what type of Thai soup I prefer and ordered.  Because I did not detect the missing Coconut Milk until after I had downed a few spoonfuls of the hot soup, and the soup I received was hot and tasty, I did not bring up the mixup.  And, afterward I received a huge portion of good Shrimp Pad Thai with medium spice.  Except for the soup discrepancy, service was good, and I was satisfied with my lunch, and inclined to return some day--but not that very afternoon.  Yet, after I realized that I had left a bottle of lactose enzyme on the table following consideration of various eyeglass frames, I returned to the restaurant in less than two hours, only to learn that a busboy recalled finding such a bottle but had already tossed it away, and the trash receptacle in which it had been placed had already gone out the door.  Although my own negligence clearly caused the pill bottle to be left behind, such a swift toss out by a restaurant employee seemed a little hasty to me.  The bottle could have been retained for at least a few hours just in case a patron came back for it.  But the Thai food was tasty and plentiful enough so that I will likely still dine here again, without any hard feelings.  XXX-1/2 stars overall."}
{"text":"LOVE the food and the service is spectacular.  The pineapple fried rice comes in an actual pineapple.  The vegetable pad tai is SO scrumdiddlyumpcious!!  The mango martini is terrific.  Very Very Very good food!  The kids love the sweet and sour chicken as well as the chicken pad thai.  Update July 2012 My husband and I both feel that the quality seems to be going down lately.  Service isn't fabulous anymore, food portions are getting much smaller and the spiciness of food is very inconsistent.  Sometimes it's great though.  Seems to be very hit or miss lately.  We love this place and do hope it will return to it's earlier greatness.  Update January 2013 After trying several Thai restaurants in the Henderson area and disliking them very much we ended up going back to Pin Kaow.  I do believe the service has gotten better since my last review and the portions seem to have increased a bit.  I do love their Pad Thai and can't seem to find anything like it.  I'm going back to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"We went to Pin Kaow tonight with my friend's mom. She's never had Thai before and we come here a lot. The service is always decent at the place, they are good about filling water and checking on you without being intrusive.  His mom and I both got Chicken Pad Thai- I got a 5 spicy, she got 0. He got something veggie, I can't remember.  Their pad thai is consistently good- it's really hard to screw up though. She really liked it and we'll keep coming back. It's a convenient location, good service, and never super busy."}
{"text":"The red curry with beef is one of my all time favorite dishes. I called in my order on my way home from work and it was ready the moment I walked in. Excellent food that is prepared quickly and with superior quality.  Great prices too!"}
{"text":"Have had this both in restaurant and to-go. It is great both ways. The beef jerky is a fav as well the pad ew see. When ordering to go the food was ready as soon as I got there. Would recommend for anyone."}
{"text":"There is plenty of help in the restaurant and they seem to stay quite busy. I haven't been to any of the other two locations, but I'm pretty satisfied with what I've seen from this one.  They deliver, which is a plus, if you're in the area and willing to pay a couple extra dollars. It's a nice change from what you're accustomed to having delivered (Pizza, Chinese, etc.)  The food here is pretty good, but I don't think it's GREAT. I've had better Thai food around town. Regardless, this is a good food option if it's convenient."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow 3 is a great Thai restaurant which does not leave anyone craving Thai food disappointed. The staff is friendly and they are usually pretty busy during the evening hours so prepare ahead of time for a wait or try and avoid the evening rush. The prices are fair and the portions are fair as well but not overly filling as you should be ordering family style. Some of my favorite dishes include, catfish delight, any and all of the curries and their ribs. Granted there are many more items on the menu that are just as awesome but I have yet to try.  Overall, a solid four star rating."}
{"text":"Spicy, spicy, spicy.   We came here on a Weekend afternoon and there was barely anybody there. Odd, but I assumed that there's so many 100s of other choices around the area. But am I glad I came here!  The servers were really nice and hospitable, explaining things on the menu. I ordered a Dragon Berry Mojito to start with Deep Fried Tofu.   I always scarfed down the fried tofu only to have my taste buds burnt. But this time I managed to split my tofu triangle in half and drizzle on the delicious sweet and sour sauce and WAIT for it to cool down a bit.   We also ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Chili Fried Rice and Gulf of Thai Special which consisted of a good amount of seafood selection and a wonderful sauce.   All spicy levels ordered at an 8, so be forewarned that by spicy, they mean spicy!"}
{"text":"Beautiful wood decor, nice atmosphere. Very good Pad Thai and yellow curry and fabulous green tea ice cream which looked a strange color but tasted great. Wish they did not close so early we had to order everything right away as their kitchen was closing in half an hour."}
{"text":"Pin Kaow was incredible for dinner last night.  Every dish we had was so good and we tried 6 different ones and 2 desserts.  We had Tom Ka soup, Panang Tofu Curry, Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles), soft shell crab salad, Nan Tok (spicy beef salad), and Pin Kaow Tilapia. Every dish was delicious and I couldn't believe I've never been here before.  Dessert was amazing too! We had mango sticky rice and deep fried bananas with coconut ice cream.  The service was really good and everyone was checking on us throughout our meal. The restaurant was very comfortable inside with the wooden walls and beautiful decorations.   We will definitely be back as I found a new favorite Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is clean, and the food is good. Not to mention the staff is friendly and service is fast. Best of all, it is reasonably priced and the portions are big enough to share."}
{"text":"I went here on 5/16/13 with two dinner companions.  It was delightful! The atmosphere is lovely and serene.  If it hadn't been windy, we might have elected to sit on the patio, but the restaurant itself was very nicely appointed.  The service was terrific!  We ordered the curry puff appetizer, the Pad Prik King with beef, the Chili Mint Noodles with chicken, and the Pad See Ew, also with chicken.  The curry puff appetizer was flavorful, although I probably wouldn't order it again just because it wasn't what we expected and there are other intriguing appetizers on the menu. All of the entrees were excellently prepared and at just the right spice level we requested.  The waiter was extremely attentive to our requests for condiments, etc. and the good service added to the wonderful experience.  I will definitely visit again!  Can't wait to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Totally Enjoyed the service and Food offered at this location. I took my wife here when she was pregnant with our little boy and they treated us so well.. The waitress complimented my wife on her glow and somehow knew very confidently that my wife was pregnant even though she wasn't really showing at the time. We ordered our food and it came just like i wanted it. HOT, they offer heat on a scale of 1 - 10 and since I like hot stuff, I ordered a 10 and it came just as I wanted it. They then after dinner surprised us with a free Rice and mango Desert Finely made to resemble a Heart with a sweetened scoop of rice topped with a nice garnish. It was all very well done. Great atmosphere, and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this thai restaurant! They're always so kind and happy and the service is SUPER fast! I come in whenever I have a craving for thai food. My favorite is the pad thai. And it gets pretty spicy! You can choose how spicy and I usually go with about a 3 or 4. It's not too spicy, and just right. I like the beef but I'm pretty sure the chicken is also bomb with pad thai. Their decor on the inside is super cute and very authentic. What we really enjoyed was their music playing in the background. Definitely a place to stop by and enjoy with some good company! They'll take care of you!"}
{"text":"I have seen Pin Kaow several times while in the shopping plaza and we decided to stop in for lunch. As soon as we walked in we smelled the insense and noticed the Thai style decor, a very Thai experience. We were greeted quickly and sat in a booth near the bar.   The server gave us the lunch specials menu which offered 10 different dishes including typical Thai dishes of pad thai, red curry, thai salad as well as some chinese dishes of sweet & sour, chow mien and fried rice. It was a nice variety and had several vegetarian dishes as well.   We chose the chicken pad thai and chicken red curry. The lunch specials come with soup of the day which was chicken egg drop. The soup and drinks came out quickly. The egg drop soup was excellent, some of the best I have had and adding chicken was a nice touch.   After my second spoonful, the lunch entrees arrived. If your on your lunch hour and in a hurry this would have been fine, but we were not. I hate to complain that food came out too fast, but it really did. I didn't get to enjoy my soup and felt rushed.   The pad Thai came with an egg roll and fried wonton and the red curry came with fried rice. The spiciness was perfect for both of our dishes and the flavors were great. We were both happy with the food. Pin Kaow has a great selection of desserts as well. They have sticky rice and mango as well as a selection of home made ice creams, of which I chose coconut. I thought it was okay, nothing special though.   Overall we enjoyed the food and Pin Kaow but we felt a little rushed with the food coming out so fast. If your in a hurry though you will appreciate it! Definitely a place I would return to when craving Thai."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night with my best friend! That atmosphere here is nice and clean. We were seated immediately. They had happy hour going on from 3-7 which had a vast variety of yummy delights and drinks. My friend and I ordered the Thai tea for our drinks, and Thai chicken wings as an appetizer. They both came out immediately. For our entree we order the Yellow chicken curry and the pineapple fried rice. When they came out the fried rice was in an actual pineapple!!! Only disappointing thing about it was it was very misleading because there were only a few chunks of pineapple.... where did the rest go? All in all I would definitely go back to try other delights!"}
{"text":"The food her is delicious. The fact that they give you he option of brown rice is great. I ordered chicken fried rice with brown rice. My friend had a penang and ohet friend had a pad thai. I love spicy food so I order mine spicy. The downfalls are food is expensive. They charge an extra $3 to substitute to brown rice and the portions were small. Go here if you have plenty of money but not that hungry!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to golf.  Lunch specials were very reasonable. My Dad had yellow chicken curry, I had hell chicken curry. I thought his was better, but mine was good.  They recommended not to go over 7/10 spicy, but I could have handled an 8.5.  Excellent, attentive service definitely kicked this up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I just ordered take-out from here and while the food was \"ok\" I was not impressed by the portion size to the price we paid. My favorite entre that we ordered was the Tom Ka Kai (coconut chicken soup $7 for a very very small cup) . That was pretty tasty, but the veggies, pineapple fried rice and chicken satay was just \"ok\". Not bad but $10 for a TINY bowl of sauteed veggies was a bit much IMO. I might go back here for the soup... but then again I might not. Ehhh...."}
{"text":"Normally love this place but 2 dishes were WAY too salty. I'm not one to return dishes but I had to send it back. They did try to make the food better but it just wasn't good. The yellow curry was good!"}
{"text":"If it were possible to give no stars or zero stars or even negative stars I would give them a -2. My husband's pad Thai was decent the appetizers came out one at a time, my husbands meal came 10 minutes before mine and when my lemon chicken came the fried chicken was not crispy it was mushy and there was barely any lemon sauce on it. I asked my waiter for more lemon sauce and 20 minutes later he came back and asked if I wanted a to go box? I told him No that I had asked for lemon sauce 20 minutes ago he realized he had forgotten us completely. I think they have more tables then they do kitchen equipment. I was very disappointed we look forward to our Friday nights and a nice meal we almost went to A fast food Chinese restaurant up the street but decided to go here and now I know we will not go here again."}
{"text":"Food and birthday surprise were great!  Take family or friend - or they can be both :-)  !! here soon.  We've enjoyed the food for years and now it's fun also!"}
{"text":"Rad Nar (pan fried noodles with Chinese broccoli) is the bomb sooo good, must try at lunch."}
{"text":"I just came back here after a rather long absence and felt the place deserved an upgrade. Still not my favorite Thai place in town, but they are solid and the service is great. Also, a little disappointed by their spice levels. I ordered a five and it felt more like a 2. I'll definitely kick up the heat on my next visit.   Liberal with drink refills and cleared plates quickly as well."}
{"text":"Really good pad Thai, but can get expensive. I recommend going for their lunch specials other wise it can get expensive of you start ordering rice, chow mien, etc. the lunch chicken pad Thai and the chicken Thai salad are really good."}
{"text":"I feel like the black sheep because I was not a fan of the food here.  I have been here twice (because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and try other dishes).  If you like your Thai curries on the sweet side, then you will like this restaurant.  I, on the other hand, do not- which is why I was a bit turned off.  I have tried the panang, duck curry, and pad thai, and all were overly sweet.  The ambience is nice, the staff is friendly- but I want delicious Thai food- and this restaurant did not deliver in that category for me."}
{"text":"This place not only beautifully decorated the food is delicious.   The Thai tea is a bit sweet so make sure to order some water. Everytime I'm here I have to order the Tom yum koong with shrimp hot pot. Don't order it more than a five or it will be tough to eat because it's too spicy. The Pad Thai is also really good. I like to or order that as a three or four. The Garlic with chicken is flavorful. It has a nice mix of vegetables.   The service is really friendly. They take the time to explain  the menu and offer suggestions."}
{"text":"I assume they don't do substitutions or alterations on menu items. I asked for a tofu substitute and coconut milk substitute on two items for dietary reasons and both requests could not be carried out. The only request I WAS able to get was black coffee. And I think I wasn't supposed to be permitted that either so thank you to my server for making it happen.  Vegan, vegetarian or if you have any other dietary restrictions then beware. You will probably be limited to whatever is printed on the menu. The Mango Salad  was decent and savory. The spice level was slightly mild, you may want to consider ordering up a number from usual. (Spice rating is 1 -10)   Service is ok, kid friendly as others have mentioned.  No water. If you want water you have to specifically order it."}
