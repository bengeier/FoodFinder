{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Vegas. I've probably ate here about 10-15 times in the last 7 years. I just love how cheesy it is and hot crispy the crust is. If you are around Circus Circus you have to try the pizza. Price is good and size is good. They fill it up with toppings. Service is good also."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, service was great.  There was an error with our order, but it was made right, and quickly.  Very happy with the experience."}
{"text":"$12 for a calzone that tasted like a giant hotpocket. Only came here cuz it was late and we had no other choice. Unless you have kids and they're clamoring for pizza, do find some alternative means of nourishment"}
{"text":"got a plain cheese pizza. tasted great! exactly what I like in a pizza. would have given 5 stars if their sodas/juices werent incredibly over priced. also, they charge you a dollar for take out. i don't really get that. i would eat there again."}
{"text":"I've eaten pizza from everywhere.  This place is my favorite. The sausage has a great flavor.  Perfectly crisp and airy.  Great sauce, great cheese.  Their sausage and onion can't be beat."}
{"text":"The food was really good here but they're PRETTY expensive I think a 12 inch was like $13 and a 16 inch is like 17 dollars. We order tropical pizza and BBQ chicken pizza and they were GOOOD. 
So expensive but food was good but I still don't think it should be worth that much. But they must make a lot of money because it's right smack in the casino and the only fast place next to dunkin donuts? Oh we also got chicken wings which were RIP OFF and breadsticks RIPOFF but they were good. 
breadstick with sauce is $3.50 and chicken wings are like 8 bucks WOAH."}
{"text":"I recommend avoiding the circus circus pizzeria. There is a reason why one has to pay up front. It is to avoid any other interaction with staff after receiving a sub par product. The location is high volume. I don't mind waiting, but was very disappointed. The pizza was flavorless with low quality ingredients. The truly frustrating facts was that the pizza was not   Cut all the way into slices. The cut was only partially visible in the cheese and did not penetrate to the crust.  There was no one available to resolve the situation. A major let down considering we payed 40 dollars for two medium pizzas. Another annoying aspect were the trick tea urns. They are designed to look like fresh brewed ice tea, but the spew syrup from a box. If you are looking for descent pizza on the strip, try the pizza by the slice at treasure island."}
{"text":"Theres nothing like fresh pizza!!! My bf took me here a few times, I like the topping options and the pizza always comes out soo good. Also love the fun atmosphere, it makes me feel so young and happy eating here. 

The only thing is that it's pretty pricey - those toppings add up!"}
{"text":"I'm going to TRY to limit my review to this \"restaurant\" and avoid going into a rant about the casino it's located in based on the fact that it's inside the stain upon society known as Circus Circus. Again, I'll try. No promises.

So, I had never been inside Circus Circus and really only went because my boyfriend and I both had never been and felt like we needed to go just because we live here and make fun of it all the time and yeah...

Basically, Circus Circus was just as gross as we thought it would be and long story short, we were hungry and decided to just get something inside the casino. We picked this pizza place since it was midnight and it was one of the few restaurants still opened. 

The staff at the order counter were nice enough but the food was extremely overpriced. I ordered a 6 inch personal cheese pizza and my boyfriend got a meatball sandwich. We also both got drink cups. The total was over $22.00. 

Uhmmmm... it's a personal pizza, a sandwich, and two fountain drinks AND inside Circus Circus... where do they get off charging this much? I thought this casino was where all the broke ass families on a budget go. How can they charge this much and get business based on the clientele inside this dump?

Nevermind the prices, it's Vegas, it's nothing new. HOWEVER, this food was beyond nasty tasting. It wasn't just like \"Oh, this tastes kinda fake but secretly I kinda like it (i.e. Dominos pizza).\" It literally tasted like how melted plastic smells. 

I forced down half of it just because it was so overpriced but after I saw that my boyfriend wasn't eating his sandwich for the same reasons, we just admitted that our food was gross as fuck and decided to go.

I don't really give a crap about service because we weren't having to pay a waitress or anything since it was order-at-the-counter style. However, the people running the dining room area basically pushed us out of the place because it was close to closing time. They shut down the soda machine like 30 minutes early and as we were finishing up, a lady came over and was like, \"Do you want a box for that stuff?\" We declined and she assumed we meant we were going to finish eating it so she said, \"Well you need to get one cause we're closing so you can't stay here.\" It was just rude but we were on our way out so I didn't really care. Nonetheless, don't push customers out of the place cause you want to go home RIGHT at closing time.

Overall, this place is a ripoff and really nasty tasting. I don't know what all the other reviewers are talking about when they say this place is amazing. I'm not a picky eater when it comes to fast food like hamburgers and pizza - I understand it's not going to be phenomenal but this place was just awful. The food tasted like the ingredients had expired. 

Congrats Circus Circus, you fulfilled all my expectations."}
{"text":"Good pizza and a Cory institution, but know the drill before you go in...the owner is not patient with the uninitiated. 

First, cash only. 

Second, be prepared when they ask you 'cooked or uncooked?'. Wuh? Yup. This took me a few moments to clarify, but it seems that   some folks get the pizza to cook later at home. The pre-baked shells make this possible. Fresh dough wouldn't work so well in this regard.

Finally, there is no medium or large, don't even ask, you'll get a lecture...it's the number of squares.  12 puts you in the large ballpark with 15 approximating an extra large. 

Good pizza and definitely an institution here."}
{"text":"This place is uber crowded. No customer service is being offered by anyone. Not the cashier not the waiters and the tables are nasty and needs to be bused. I just wanted my calzone so I could leave by it them took about a half an hour to get t to me. A fellow customer was bitchin sayin \"all I wanted were some hot waaaaang.\" she kept on saying it over and over. She finally talked to one of the staff to see if her order was up. As he walked away she yells across the room and says, \" don't forget my ranch dressing and my BLUE CHEESE DIP.\" I was thoroughly entertained until I had to wait another ten mins to get my food. The calzone was decent but not at all worth the wait. I remember going to circus circus when i was younger but I don't remember it being this ghetto. I guess it's true what they say, ignorance is bliss."}
{"text":"Really really really disappointing.. and annoying.

My siblings and I would usually visit this place during our stay at Circus Circus. Although we've had this place many times before, it has never been THIS bad. 

It all started off when we entered the line to order before getting seated. This was at around 9:00 pm. The line was a little long, so we expected to only wait AT MAX 30 minutes because there wasn't that many people ahead of us. BUT NO. The cashier seemed to have taken 30 minutes on ONE party of people, and was scrambling around to find things. This led to no progress on the line whatsoever. A few minuets later, my family and I started to notice tables were emptying, yet the line was not moving. When another 30 minuets passed, we finally reached the front of the line. The cashier apologized for the wait and asked for our order. We ordered a \"midway meat medley\" but he didn't seem to know what it was. He stared at the screen for what seemed like a minute, and kept asking us, until he finally got it. We then got our number and was seated.

It didn't end there..

As my family and I sat at the booth, ANOTHER 30 minutes passed, and our pizza was nowhere to be seen. My sister asked one of the workers to check on the pizza, and the worker returned saying it was in the oven. We then sat down for another 30 MINUTES and pizza finally came. At this point, we were starving and we started eating. When I wanted to refill my soda cup, I noticed the floor is covered with pizza sauce and oil, to a point where I almost slipped. When I returned to my table, there was even a knife on the floor, that for the almost 2 hours I was there, no staff member (even as I saw them look at it) picked it up.

Highly disappointed and annoyed."}
{"text":"I'll have to say, for a pizzeria in a budget casino/hotel, it was good! The thin crust was perfect, the sauce was a tomato paste base, which is the best way to make sauce. The only complaint was there was a little too much cheese for me, but hey, everyone else loves extra cheese! One past review mentioned it was $15, 20min wait and the dining room smelled like smoke. It's not domino's so yes it's $15, it does take 20 to 30 minutes to cook pizza and it is in the middle of a budget hotel casino, it's smokey."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Circus Circus Pizzeria YEARS ago when I was a kid and Vegas didn't have mega resorts. My folks hated the place, but me and my sister liked playing games in the midway, and afterwards we would have pizza. The location has long since moved downstairs, but I recently went back just for old times sake, and I don't know if it was nostalgia, or if I was just hungry, but this pizza tasted really good, and just how I'd remembered it! If you find yourself in Vegas... don't waste your time at the Circus Circus. But if you have kids and get stuck here, don't hesitate to eat the pizza!"}
{"text":"Stay away!  Touch you use a credit card they will Jack your money...
Bill was $40 dollars.. to go.. I tip $10.. magically the tip in the morning was charged for $50
Not drinking, just with my family... Stay away they are not reputable."}
{"text":"On Wednesday, when the kids and I woke up, we went to the pool to hang out. Lil Man went swimming while my Lil Sister and hung around the pool. After two hours of hanging out, we decided to go get something to eat. We decided to try the Pizzeria. We ordered the 16 inch Tropical a-Delite Pizza that had ham, bacon, canadian bacon, sausage, pineapple, green onions, green peppers, and a few other ingredients that I can not remember. We ate all but the last two pieces of pizza because we were stuffed. The pizza itself was good, but we did not care for the crust because it was a pan crust. WE LOVE STUFF CRUST. Overall the pizza was good, the atmosphere was good and the waitress, well what can I say, was good to us. We had the same waitress from the Mexitalia  X-press. It was busy, crowded, but the atmosphere was peaceful."}
{"text":"I'm from Napa, and when I'm in Vegas, I make a bee-line for the Pizzeria at Circus, Circus, which is among the BEST pizza I've had anywhere!  I discovered it in 2010 and hit it every time I return.  Although Circus, Circus ranks as the dregs of the Strip casinos, making our way past the tacky shops and arcades to the Pizzeria is always worth it!  The crust is perfect, and the pepperoni and Hawaiian flavors are always a winner.  Love the Caesar's salad, as well.  Going again tonight, in fact. When Vegas finally detonates an H~Bomb on Circus, Circus, I hope they have the good sense to relocate the Pizzeria first, so we can continue enjoying a Vegas Strip tradition."}
{"text":"Better than X-Lax, my colon has never felt cleaner! the bread sticks were fantastic but the pizza let me get a full body cleanse. it gave me the right nausea to empty my entire body front and back! would recommend if you're clogged."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing! We had the Midway Meat Medley, and this guy weighed a TON! Jam-packed full of meat, gooey, cheesy, scalding hot. If you're in the mood to be satisfied, give them a try. Very friendly delivery man. The medium pepperoni pizza wasn't as great as the specialty, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. Still great."}
{"text":"Would rate 3.5 stars if you have good service otherwise 3 stars.

I've been eating at Pizzeria for years. Every time I come to Circus Circus, its a comped staple. The pizza quality has remained the same.

The food portion sizes are good. The Largest size Circus Garden Delite easily filled up 4 adults (2 men 2 women), with some left-over slices still.

The breadsticks are TERRIBLE and feel like they're covered in raw flower. Would not do again.

Salad is mediocre, and the pepsi drink choices are equally bad."}
{"text":"What a disappointment to have to write this review, not sure it will amount to much but I need to share my recent experience. I arrived at 11pm, only for a Caesar salad, no chicken..typically with dine in service it takes about 5 minutes to arrive, sometimes less. I wanted one for my daughter for take out service, I figured with only 2 people ahead of me, I would be in and out of there in a few minutes. Guess how long it took? 30 minutes wait time, no apology or acknowledgement from staff who were not doing anything since nobody was really there. I asked several times what was the hold up and kept getting the same reply, it's on it's way, it's on it's way. That's a crappy way to treat a loyal customer, now I know what the other Yelpers who left a poor review are referring to. So, with that said..do what you want with this review, I'm not exaggerating in any way..see for yourself. 

I found the same quality Caesar Salad at Westside Deli which tells me they are all pre-made and packaged with same dressing, etc. That just tells me that here at Pizzeria they had it packaged and could have had me on my way within minutes but I was intentionally ignored for whatever reason. Little marks like this make a big difference especially when I've been a patron for well over ten years. 
Mulling things over, I decided this review is accurate and based on the fact I spent 75 dollars the day prior on 2 small 12 inch pizzas, 2 drinks and 2 salads..this gives me reason to move forward and order my pizza elsewhere, not a value at all .

Won't be back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place unless you want to waste your time, money and appetite."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Waited a bit longer than we expected but not bad. Was nit hungry but I finished 3 slices!"}
{"text":"This past week I returned to Pizzeria for the first time since the late-1980s. It was just as great as I remembered, and the owner was super-nice. I sat in my truck and wolfed down a 4-cut plain and was fat and happy. I'll definitely return on my next visit to Coraopolis, however far in the future that may be!"}
{"text":"We ordered a personal pan cheese pizza for my 3 yr old. He loved it and ate the whole pizza. He is a very picky eater and would spit food if he didn't like the food. I also tasted a piece of the pizza and it was really good. The service was not too fast or not too slow."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Nothing really high end for toppings quality but, I enjoyed my supreme style. Crust is crisp and a little thicker then a thin crust. Plenty of hard working staff. One minus...12\" with a beer $22 was pricey but, its on the strip!"}
{"text":"If there's a zero, I would've given that. Sh*ttiest place ever. An 8 in veggie pizza took FOREVER to order. Never will I ever set foot on here again."}
{"text":"The lowdown is that it's Christmas, and I'm the biggest kid at heart in Circus Circus. Casino: Maybe. Adventuredome: Big YES!

My review, however, is for Pizzeria, an Italian dining place right in the midst of the casino. I cannot be accurate when I say it is nondescript because it is next to the busy walkway and just across the slot machines, but it's there, present and lost among the hum of frenetic activity. Customers line up for their orders, and it is my assumption that they do so because they are stuck inside, but what they don't expect  (at least for me) is that they are up for a flavorful meal. I had tried the BBQ pizza, lasagna, chicken wings, and chef salad, and they are a bomb of goodness. One may argue that the appetite is more sharp after a losing battle with arcade games, but the food is good, PERIOD, even if I combine all the second-hand smoke that I inhaled and the excitement of watching the performers do their tireless acts for the kids whose hearts they won."}
{"text":"The cashier ESMERALDITA was VERY RUDE. All she did was gossip and say bad words out loud. When I approached to order she looked at me then turned her back and continued to gossip. She then rudely asked me what I want to order and when I began ordering, she started gossiping to her co worker again! She cut me off to continue gossiping! While we sat there eating, she bad mouthed other co workers very loudly. We could not eat in peace. She was saying bad words in Spanish out loud! Very rude. ESMERALDITA was her name. I was there on 12/20/17 4:30pm."}
{"text":"Our experience was poor. The pizza tasted horrible with small soft round sausage that reminded me of kibble. Our bill was confusing. Did not finish our pizza or attempt to eat the left overs. I would not go back. Just my opinion from one visit."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience here about 6 months ago. I went again this week & I love it once again. The great customer service they were lacking has greatly improved. Will definitely be a regular spot for me"}
{"text":"Road Trip
Summer 2016

Adventuredome is exhausting!!! What was I thinking when I bought an All Day Pass?!?! I needed a break after two rides with my toddler! 

Since my nephews joined us, I thought pizza would be a great snack for everybody. They agreed. We found Pizzeria by the main casino and I was bummed when I saw a long waiting line. After 15 minutes we were at the register and we ordered a 16\" pepperoni pizza. Hooray for free refills! We waited another 10-15 minutes until it was served on our table. 

The pizza was pretty decent. It was very cheesy and I liked how it wasn't  too soggy. I wish the crust was crispier, though. One of my nephews mentioned,\"This is good but the pizza from the liquor store is way better. Do you guys remember that place?\" Of course, I remember! He was talking about Giants NY Pizza and Subs in Oregon. I totally agree but Pizzeria is conveniently located in Circus Circus. The pepperoni pizza was a sufficient snack before running around in Adventuredome with my toddler again!

Total: $34"}
{"text":"Who stops serving customers in a long line to talk to a coworker about employees gossiping on Facebook about her?!...the cashier. Smh.  I would've turned around and left but what can you do when there aren't many food options for kids in circus circus and his favorite food is pizza. Besides that he enjoyed his pizza."}
{"text":"We weren't too hungry, so we decided on pizza for dinner. You order first, when you walk in. We chose to eat there instead of taking it to go so they gave us a number and then we got to decide where to sit. If you get a drink, they have a fountain machine with Pepsi products with free refills.

The pizza was delicious! We ordered the Tropical Pair-of-Dice. The toppings were fresh and they make the pizza when you order it-not beforehand. The crust was also very good. We also had an order of breadsticks. They brought them before the pizza. They were soft and fresh and brought out with marinera sauce. 

They had parmesan cheese and pepper flakes on the tables; ranch and hot sauce were also offered. The waiter was very friendly and attentive and packed our leftover for us and gave us plates and plastic ware.

Overall, fresh and delicious pizza made once ordered!"}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza with pep. and Italian sausage.  Wings not as good.  house salad s good.  Great price."}
{"text":"Like most things (food, service, and accommodations) at Circus, Circus, the Pizzeria was BELOW average, especially for the price. 1 semi large (NO frills) pizza cost nearly $40.00 bucks. 
   Not to mention, it was SUPER salty, with NO flavor, and hard crust.
 I suggest, if you're looking for a slice of heaven, circumvent Pizzeria at Circus, Circus, and try a pizza joint off the strip in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is our first time coming here to this pizza place.the service is terrible from the cashier (sherylly) to the supervisor.. We waited to be seated more than 20mins there was no customer service here while we were trying to order this girl was interrupting us to have a conversation with one of her coworkers talking about Xmas ..really!!!100% rude they took along time to serve or anything...will not come here again..McDonald's has better services than this....they have great food I must say ...great flavor"}
{"text":"The prices are really high but the pizza is really good we paid $14 for a 12\" pepperoni which consisted of eight slices. We will definitely eat here instead of the buffet and enjoy a tastier meal for a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"Waooooooooow!! ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS STAAAY AWAY!! The Chef Jose and there entire staff don't care about there customers. They sit and point there fingers and laugh while they serve up over priced and substandard food, with no apology. The pizza was wrong the sandwich was wrong. ARE WE UP SET!? YES WE ARE. The sad part of this whole situation is that the entire staff and owner are Latino with the exception of some of the kitchen staff. We felt the full brunt of reverse discrimination. Other cultures wonder why Mexicans are in the situation that we are in?..................... They don't stand together in the important issues, but will defend there honor in soccer  and being proud that Mexicans drink more Budweiser than any other culture. How sad is that. Well lesson to be learned. Never ever ever come back to this pizzeria or to the Circus Circus Casino Ever again. Just like there are millions of customer that come to this restaurant and Casino ever year we too have a choice to go to any other Casino and spend our hard earned money else where."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I went into this expecting to be disappointed, and very critical of this pizza. I was actually pleasantly surprised. When they say \"Thin Crust\" they mean THIN. As in plastic knife blade, thin. 

I had a Sausage and mushroom pizza. And the flavors were very good. I'm usually not a fan of pizzas with sweeter sauces, but this one worked well with the other toppings, and the mushrooms were the star of the pizza. Overall very happy with the meal, but nothing beats Chicago pizza."}
{"text":"Let's face it... Vegas is pricey. Took the kids to the Adenturedome and stopped here for lunch. The pizza wasn't earth shattering, but we had lunch for 3 of us for $24 and that unheard of!  Fountain drinks are $4 each, which is a joke, so I had the kids share and they had free refills. The lady who took our order at the entrance didn't have much job satisfaction   and the smoke from the casino is a drag but this place works in a pinch and it's better than what is in the dome."}
{"text":"Vraiment pas terrible et le service laisse a désiré"}
{"text":"I decided to skip Christmas and go to Vegas with friends for the holiday. Sandra was our waitress, she was so friendly and very helpful. Everything in Vegas is more expensive than it should be. So, I get it... but for what we got, I felt it was a fair deal. Considering the other hotels had their brunches starting at $50 per person. I ordered a salad and just had water. It was very weird that they had no glasses for water. Sandra found me like a Circus Circus shot glass type of glass for water. I had to go back several times to quench my thirst. Very odd. But all in all...

They were hustling in the back and food came out quick and when you are hungry and the lines are so long everywhere else and the buffets are closed or you have to pay over $50 for a meal...it is a good deal. My salad was good and it was a pretty hearty portion. Sandra and the other staff members are the reason that they got 4 stars. I saw how hard they were working to please all of their tables and in the back they were on fire to get the food out as quickly as possible. Sandra had a genuine personality even though no one was leaving her a tip, I watched 3 tables get up and not even leave a few bucks on the table. We finished our meal and I did the right thing and found her and left her a bigger tip than our bill required. You should have seen the look on her face. She smiled so big and said thank you so very much. I told her, thank you. I see how hard you work. I know what it is like to bust your tail like that...I have been in the service industry. Good work should always be rewarded."}
{"text":"We settled at Circus Circus Pizzeria after circling the Adventuredome and the casino with little success (other places were only open past 5pm). To our surprise, the pizza was pretty decent!

Their form of pesto = basil and pine nuts on the pizza, not bad at all. We ordered the pesto pizza with pepperoni, but they accidentally made us a regular pepperoni pizza.... 10-15 minutes later, we had our correct pizza.

Like any dining area in a casino, there is not smoking, but it's close enough to the casino area where players can easily light a cigarette. 

Overall, the service was friendly, the price was decent, the dining area was comfy and clean. You can't ask for much more from a restaurant operating inside a casino. 

Pro tip: there's a Foursquare offer if you check in.

Wings had very little meat on them.

Pizza was not greasy
Wing sauce was flavorful without being pure heat
There is parmesan cheese on the table
They bring the food to your table straight from the oven
LOTS of cheese.

{"text":"This hotel is crazy. They are servicing room service pizza from the fast food pizzeria in the casino. How do they expect casino patrons to wait 30-40 minutes for a pizza."}
{"text":"They just redid the interior of this area, it looks better.  For a big casino on the Strip, their pizza is pretty good.  It tastes like someone made it from scratch.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it is pretty expensive, but not like the pizza at the Luxor or anything!  It's just a bit pricey.  You order and then sit and they bring the pizza to your table.  You fill and refill your own drinks, which is a good deal.  My husband and I love the BBQ chicken pizza.  We have to stop here every time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I don't know how you can screw up chicken wings, but my god. It was like they boiled them and then dipped them in Tabasco. Super disappointing."}
{"text":"The pizza here is hot and delicious. Great family atmosphere and the service is great. Worth a visit if you're in the mood for pizza. For the price of the pizza, it's worth every bite."}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok, the outer edges were barely cooked :). But we were so hungry, so we removed the crust from the edges and had the rest. Delivery to circus-circus room took a little over an hour, it was Christmas night though. But the chicken wings were delicious!! I'd give a 4.0 for that."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by right before Frightdome 2012.

The decor is REALLY cheezy but kind of fits in with the circus circus decor. I got medium buffalo wings and my boyfriend got the sausage pepper sandwich.
my boyfriend said the sandwich was really good. as for me, I found the wings ot be A OK. they were freshly cooked, they were cooked all the way though and really moist, but the 'medium' tasted like 'mild' and didn't impress me. Service was fast and good, but I was hoping to see a smile on the waitresses faces. I figured it was because it was a Saturday during Frightdome; It gets crazy during the month of October."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the drinks are outrageously priced! $4 for a really small fountain drink. Shouldn't be more than $1.50."}
{"text":"The pizza, wings and mozzarella cheese sticks were delicious. The place is clean and comfortable. The price is reasonable and what you'd expect in Vegas. The wait for our pizza was terrible. From seat to food (pizza) the wait was over an hour, hence the four stars rather than 5. The only other problem was the smell of cigarette smoke from the casino. Major CON about Vegas in general."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Me and some friends got the meat lovers type pizza. It was pretty damn good and completely caught me by surprise. Try the pizza with a mikes hard lemonade.....damn good combo. Friendly and quick service. This pizza will fill you up though. 3 of us got taken to our limits on 1 large size pizza. I will come back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a little pricey and all we got was a 12\" cheese/pepperoni pizza and chicken wings (hot). The pizza was okay, it was really greasy. I know pizzas have grease but the grease was a orange color on top of the pizza, so I just used a napkin to take it off. The Buffalo wings were delicious - crispy and spicy - just how I like them. This place also does not serve water in water cups, so I was a little upset about that. Overall, I don't plan on going here again and if I do it might be for the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Long wait for small simple takeout order. Marinara sauce had lots of meat in it which is not good for vegetarians. Also forgot to include breadstick."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good. It had a nice, thin crust which I personally like a lot. I would recommend ordering the buffalo wings. I ordered the hot wings, which were a little bit more spicy than what I expected, but they were great. Only thing I didn't really like was that I kept getting this weird smell. Other than that it was good"}
{"text":"Starting off with the rudest cashier/server with the most attitude, we decided on a small cheese pizza and lasagna came out to about $25

Then comes the waiting
we waited
and waited...
and waited

then we notice that our food was at the counter and has been sitting there a long with lots of other orders getting backed up.. no servers in sight

so we get up to go get our now luke warm food... and the servers come out and ask us what we're doing??? and she refuses us to take our own food, she wanted to carry it to our table? so she follows us back to the table, and says she'll be back with silverware so i can eat my lasagna... another 5-10 minutes of staring at my food getting colder. 

service; terrible
food: not too bad actually, probably better when served fresh and hot? not sure, wouldn't know.

so you decide if it's worth it"}
{"text":"After a trip to the Adventuredome in Circus Circus, we were desperate to find a good place to eat. We saw this little pizzeria on our way in, so stopped in on our way out. Gets a bit crowded so I recommend snagging a table as soon as you get there. They will stop taking dine in orders if the dining room is full-take out only.

Pizza is so delicious. Well-made and tasty. We ordered some bread sticks, pepperoni pizza along with a couple beers and enjoyed a nice dinner with the family. While we were waiting for our food, we were able to let our older kids wander to Circus Circus arcade area and check it out--it was nearby. Wait time was about 30 minutes but we were told about it when we ordered, so it was ok.

They also offer wait staff, which is great. They bring out your food, bring you utensils/plates and bus your table throughout. I was very pleased with our experience here and highly recommend."}
{"text":"best pizza ever love it its super delicious and made to perfection! Ive been coming to circus circus ever since i can remember, the pizzeria has such great food from the pizza to breadsticks to salads and spaghetti and a lot more of delicous foods. I come here everytime i am in vegas for lunch. Definitely one of the best pizza spots in all of las vegas!"}
{"text":"My review is only for the pizza, since that's the only thing we ate there. Of course, pizza is so subjective; everybody has different expectations. But for me, it was THE BEST PIZZA OF MY LIFE. Seriously, I was moaning with delight. Perfect sauce. Lots of cheese. Awesome crust. I could have easily eaten the whole thing myself. In fact, my mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"It was pretty dead when we were there but the pizza was not to bad and cheap eats. The decoration was so nasty tho."}
{"text":"Pizza, above average in taste, though pretty greasy, crust wasn't my favorite thing. Hot wings, average. Vegetables severed with them looked like it had freezer burn. Fountain drink cups smaller than most restaurants. A bit overpriced for the whole experience. Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Pizza lunch after a long walk on the strip.  The restaurant is inside Circus Circus right as you walk in through the strip and walk through the casino a bit.  You walk down a little into the restaurant cove.

You can see the chef's twirling the pizza dough and their big white hats.  We got a 16 inch pepperoni and it was enough for 2 adults and 2 kids, pretty cheap too considering it's inside a hotel.  We didn't have to wait too long.

The dough was crisp on the bottom and soft on the inside, there was a lot of cheesyness and just enough pepperoni on each piece,.  The pizza was brought to us by a server who was very nice."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good. I suggest getting it to go or room service. We decided to eat there and it was sooooo slow! Other people were getting there food before we got ours! We had to ask the waitress (once she gave us attention) twice to check on our order!  Next time it will be to go."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday because we heard the pizza was good. Pizza's alright. I've had better here in LA. My problem was with the service itself. The woman taking the orders couldn't take orders correctly, she was slow, and she kept disappearing to the back several times making the wait just to order even longer! Horrible! The wait time to get the food was almost an hour! what the fudge? why so long? the point here is that they need more than one overwhelmed filipina at the front taking orders and going crazy looking for lost orders. They need more pizza makers in the back as well to get those pizzas out fast. Oh yeah, we also ordered mild wings and the woman gave us spicy wings  (which I can eat, but friend's wife can't!).  Lame, expensive, and slow. Never again. The only nice people there were the elderly waitress, and the other young woman who made sure we got our wings on time."}
{"text":"Loud, noisy, the whole place reeks of cigarette smoke and it's insanely hot inside the place. After finally maneuvering my way thru the crazy crowds within the hotel/lobby/ casino I get to the pizza place and place an order for a simple cheese pizza for my two kids who are exhausted. They tell me it's going to be a 20 minute wait and $15. Ok so I wait and walk around this heated furnace and feel sick with all the second hand smoke. I can't begin to understand who thinks this this is a family friendly place. Finally get the pizza and we leave (it was to go) and get to our hotel to eat it and it's awful. Doesn't feel cooked thoroughly and the sauce is sweet like ketchup. Seriously?! $15 for this. Never stepping back in here for sure. Stay away unless you want to waste your time, money and appetite. Even my kids cld barely finish a slice it was that bad! And which kid can't eat pizza!! Nope. Not going back!"}
{"text":"We ordered a compound which was full of American cheese and none of the toppings that they claimed were supposed to be in the calzone, along with that we also ordered Wings which were still frozen $38 is way too much to pay for a shity meal Please be aware do not eat here it's not worth the money"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this simple for readers.

Pro: Food and pricing of the food (for its portion) are highly reasonable, good tasting, and a good choice for families to dine in at. I recommend the Tropical-Pair-A-Dice.

Cons: Wait times for pizza are ridiculous on a slow night, it will take AT LEAST half an hour for the pizza to arrive. On a busy night that we went, it took around 45 minutes. In addition, service and the waiters/waitress there are subpar. Anna, in particular, was extremely rude and demeaning to guests. Other waitresses are waiters were okay but usually took several calls for them to address and issue.

Credibility of this Rating and Review: We eat at the Pizzeria every year and have been doing so for the past 17 years."}
{"text":"Pizza okay but the sandwich was terrible , not even close to what a Italian sub would be . they tossed pizza toppings on a bun and called it a sub . very sad sandwich, waste of 9 bucks ."}
{"text":"Cute pizza place in Circus Circus casino! Great customer service and friendly staff. Pizza is amazing in flavor & nice balance between thin and thick crust."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from their spaghetti. spaghetti that didn't even have meat it in. It was horrible."}
{"text":"Pretty rude staff. Had to wait 30 minutes for a small pizza and an appetizer that was served AFTER my pizza came. I waited for another server to walk by to ask for ranch and they didn't say anything but came back and threw a small packet of ranch on the table. Asked for a box and they came by with one and slapped it on the table and walked away.. fried ravioli as pretty good, the pizza wasn't my favorite. Probably wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you just came from the dome. The pizza is pretty good it's just the 30 minute wait that isn't pleasing."}
{"text":"Best pizza here, been coming here with the family for over a decade plus. Interesting enough I've read some of the reviews regarding this establishment, from my point these folks don't know what an excellent pizzeria is period. To all the folks that know what an excellent pizzeria is, I highly recommend this pizzeria!"}
{"text":"My friends and I didn't want to eat at the Westside Deli two days in a row so came here. We ordered the 12' \"Tropical Pair A Dice\" which is basically like a Hawaiian pizza but with bell peppers and pepperoni.

The 12\" was enough to feed 7 people, about two slices each. It was pretty pricey, but totally worth it. The pizza had gooey cheese and had lots of toppings. The crust is also crispy and light. Pile on the parm and pepper flakes!

The wait wasn't that long and the portions are larger than the display next to the cashier."}
{"text":"Good pizza - very similar to Pizza Plaza a couple blocks away, but Pizza Plaza is a bit better
this place has been around for a long time!"}
{"text":"The only reason why they lost a star was due to their customer service. I called to order ahead of time because the line was super long and didn't feel like standing there to place an order. So I called and asked if I can place an order for pick up and they asked if I was staying in circus circus and I said \"yes, I'm in the Manor building\" and the girl on the other end rudely said \"oh well you need to call and order from your room and we only do delivery.\" So I was like ok no biggie they've delivered to the room before so I walked back to my room and calld and what do they tell me \"we no longer deliver to the Manor building\" by this time I was already hungry and annoyed and told them what had happened when I first called and all she could said was \"oh well we don't deliver there\" (-_-) not even an apology! But other than that their hot wings are great and their pizza is good as well. For those staying in the Manor just be aware they don't deliver !"}
{"text":"Sausage and onion is great. Been goin there for many years.friendly service, pizza always the same very good."}
{"text":"The hotel I stayed at didn't have any fried foods which I was craving for and so I came to this place and ordered the buffalo wings. This place was pretty busy, service was slow and food mediocre.  I saw the disgust of other customers face because the service was so bad. Tables were not being cleaned and people were forced to put used plates on the side so they can have a place to it.....I will never return here again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My daughters pizza came 15 minutes after we finished our meat. Overpriced for the quality of the food"}
{"text":"They deliver to your room! Need I say more? $15 for a 12in pepperoni pizza made it to my room in 15 minutes! Pizza was pretty good...my son was happy and that made me happy. Can't rate on their restaurant service but if you stay at the Circus Circus Casino and decide to take an in room break from it all, order a pizza. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"MMMMM... I just had another mouth orgasm today... 

We ate at the Pizzeria Circus Circus for dinner and they did not disappoint! 

Simple, 16' pepperoni fresh baked and piping hot! Plenty of cheese and topping. The crust was light and flaky. Delicious! 

Will definitely do a repeat the next time we stop by Circus Circus. 

All you can drink fountain soda and iced tea. Love that!"}
{"text":"For casino food, this is great. For \"food food,\" this is just decent. The pizza was good and made to order. We got the meat lovers (named something else here but you get the idea) and it was perfect. The sweeter sauce is nice but there wasn't enough on ours.
Overall, it's a basic pizza place. Better than your chain stores but not the best pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pizza, bread sticks and mozzarella cheese sticks were fantastic. The only reason i didnt give it 5 star is because the drinks are priced high $4+."}
{"text":"It's decent pizza but nothing out of the ordinary.  Service was adequate."}
{"text":"The pizza was basic, the cheese was bland there was nothing special about this place. ... also the lettuce was old.. the worst $10 salad I've ever had."}
