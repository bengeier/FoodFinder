{"text":"This review is just about the food, service and atmosphere on a night where they did not have live music.  I've been here a couple of times.  The food is good.  I've had the burger and the walnut burger and both were solid (not excellent, but good). Every time I've gone it's been pretty empty and the bar feels a bit dirty (I'm a fan of dive bars but something about this one was a bit too much for me).  Maybe if it had been full I wouldn't have noticed.  While service here has been adequate some of the staff seem to have a very negative attitude towards the customers.  They are generally curt, and one time, when we came in after the kitchen had closed (but didn't realize it), we were rudely told that they were no longer serving food and would close soon.  Now, I have worked in food service so I know what it's like to have people come in when you've already shutting things down, but we were not demanding or anything.  They could have courteously let us know that the kitchen was closed and we would have been on our way.  Anyway, at this point, I generally stay away from this place but if a friend really wanted to go there, or a band was playing that I wanted to see, I would stop by."}
{"text":"The Harmony probably hasn't changed in 20 years, and I hope it never does. 

This is the first place I go when introducing new people to Madison's east side. It has a great bar atmosphere, and surprisingly good food. The pub chips with bleu cheese are a must, and their curds ain't bad either. Despite what some reviewers say, I love their pizza, and it might be the best sauce in town (they make it on site, I'm  told). The Walnut burger is unbelievable, and I've never had anything there I didn't like. It's not fancy, but it is quality."}
{"text":"I just want to mention that we came back on a Sunday afternoon at around 8:30.  We ordered burgers and cheese curds.  They tasted a lot like burgers and cheese curds.  I also don't think the prices are that great on further reflection.  6 dollars for a stinkin cheeseburger?  That's not great...  3 dollars for a pabst?  

But the place was kid free this time.  That's nice.  

I would give higher ratings, but some drunk regular yelled at us for ordering from the menu instead of the \"board.\"  Unpleasant."}
{"text":"The Harmony serves my favorite meal in all of Madison - maybe all of the world - the walnut burger. This is not a hamburger with walnuts as a topping, no. This is a burger MADE of walnuts. I know it sounds weird, but I URGE you: give it a chance. It's nutty and rich and flavorful and I could easily eat one every week. Pairs perfectly with an order of \"Hot Chips\" aka potato chips made fresh so they come out of the frier still hot and soft. YUM! Pro tip: get the blue cheese spread on top of the burger (swiss if you're not a fan of blue) with fried onions, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. Welcome to heaven! PS: If you're not feeling a walnut burger (which you're crazy if not), Harmony's pizza, sandwiches, and regular hamburgers are also all top notch."}
{"text":"Bartenders and clientele not as bad as a fart. Food is good. If you're looking for random stimulating conversation though, stay home and talk to yourself."}
{"text":"The hubby and I always default to Harmony Bar when we have a craving for a good burger and a local brew (even before noon). My favorite is the blue burger-a burger smothed in blue cheese and all the traditional toppings. The pizzas are worth waiting for-check on the days and times they'll make a pizza for you.
As always a smoke free environment is worth driving to Madison for."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood spot- not pretentious and has a good tap list. This is one of my favorite places to grab a quick beer or bite or watch a game. The service is always prompt and very friendly."}
{"text":"I had a walnut burger coupled with your hot blue cheese chips...it was ok."}
{"text":"I contest the Harmony's placement in the dive bar category. This one of the best of Wisconsin's old style taverns still operating, essentially a bar meant for the whole family. I've seen plenty of people bring their kids in for some pizza around dinner (pretty good too), they clear out as the band sets up to entertain the adults for the evening. It's nice that the band area is separate from the bar, making it easier to order and converse if you don't care for the music. They have a great bar with a good tap selection, and the whole place has enough space that I've never felt packed in even on busy Friday nights."}
{"text":"I used to love their white house sandwich and came with my family for years.  Fast forward to coming in with a friend of color for a sandwich in the afternoon, we are greeted with a gruff \"ID's?\" that oozed \"we don't  want you here.\" I was of age but not planning on drinking. I'd left my ID in the car but this abhorrent \"hospitality\" was enough to make us leave and never come back. I heard from family their food has gone down in quality so I am glad I'm not missing much.  I'll continue recreating my own version of grilled cheese meets Reuben at home."}
{"text":"Beer selection is ok. Good room for seeing bands - sound was great. However, majority of the male staff here is unapologetically rude & disrespectful. Aging sports neanderthals that could care less that you're there.  

Don't waste your time - spend your money at Mickey's Tavern or Crystal Corner instead."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Bar tender (tall with blonde hair she wouldn't give her name). Went for my boyfriend's birthday which happened to be doing the Atwood pub beer crawl. She said after we picked our beers, that we can't use those for the pub crawl and that we need to pick only one beer. She said we should know that already, even though it's not on the menu or on the punch card, and then mumbled under her breath, \" well I guess I am supposed to be the one to tell everyone since they don't get it\". It wasn't advertised anywhere. See was so rude and it was disgusting to see a human being let alone a worker talk and behave like that. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"I'm not a local, which means I don't really understand the appeal of the Harmony. 

Hot chips and dip? I'll eat 'em, but they're not the stuff dreams are made of. 

Old-school cafeteria-style tables? Dim lighting, rickety tables and chairs? Kids (like, aged 6 and under) running wild and telling my group of adults to stop swearing? Guess I'm just a snob. 

On the plus side, gin & tonics were $3 each on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I've been to the Harmony several times before, but last night was the first time I've been there for live music, and also the first time I tried their famed Walnut Burger.

First, you should know that the Harmony is indeed a bar. If you go expecting an upscale \"gastro-pub\" experience of chic bar food, then you will be disappointed. There are no waiters, and you seat yourself. You order food and drinks at the bar, and  a food runner brings out your order when it's ready. Its got a dive bar atmosphere, and the interior is pretty run down. 

After fighting for a table due to the crowd that was rapidly accumulating in anticipation of that evening's band, my friends and I perused the menu. It contains primarily stereotypical bar food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc), but there are a few exceptions. There are several vegetarian options, including veggie nachos, so if you're a non meat eater, you would probably find lots of things to order at The Harmony. Most notably, The Harmony offers a walnut burger. I'm told they're famous for it, so I ordered the walnut burger with blue cheese and a side of homemade potato chips with \"Bleu Cheese Dip\". (What can I say, I really, really love Blue Cheese!) It took awhile for the food to come out, so we drank beer while we waited. Our table of about 10 people ordered 3 pitchers to share. I am not sure what all of them were, but in honor of the WI bar experience, I stuck to PBR. It was as good as PBR can be.

Onto the food: The blue cheese walnut burger came topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce in addition to blue cheese crumbles, rather than plain blue cheese crumbles like I had been anticipating. It also came with onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The lettuce and tomato were exceptionally fresh and ripe looking. I was really impressed, especially by the tomato (it was actually red!). I bit into it and was immediately transported to blue cheese heaven. It was fantastic. I will qualify this praise with the statement that the reason I loved this burger so much was largely a result of the copious blue cheese flavor. I am not sure the walnut burger itself was why it tasted so great. The chips were also awesome. They arrived piping hot. Some were crunchy and others were chewier. It was clear that they were made to order. The Bleu Cheese Dip they came with was similar to what came on my burger, and as a result, was amazing. 

We ate as the band played and just reveled in how fun the whole experience was. By the way, the band was great! It was a Rockabilly group called The Fast Clydes. If you like that style of music, I couldn't recommend them more. They had a ton of energy and knew how to work the crowd. I had a blast. 

All this said, there are a few things that I think The Harmony could improve upon. First off, the tables in the main dining area are plastic. They're the exact same tables that you played beer pong on in college. I feel like The Harmony excels in spite of its dive bar atmosphere, and not necessarily because of it. Therefore, if they invested just a little bit of money to spruce up the interior, I think they would see a return. The Atwood area is still rocking that hippie vibe, for sure, but more and more, I am noticing newer and more upscale establishments. To me, that says that there's probably a market for it and the times, they are a changin'. Also, I don't mind ordering food and drinks at the bar. However, I think The Harmony would benefit from offering table service, at least during shows on Friday and Saturday night. I have only ever been to The Harmony with a group, and it sucks to have to walk away from the conversation to get another beer, a process which can take 10 or 15 minutes if it's crowded. All-in-all, these drawbacks are minor, and I'll be back at The Harmony many times this summer!"}
{"text":"I dream about the hot potato chips with blue cheese (basically thick blue cheese salad dressing served on the side).

Good things to know:
- Definitely not a gastro pub as others have mentioned but delicious affordable food and decent beer selection.
- Cash only
- Sometimes get kicked out of the main room for concerts
- Order both food and drinks at the bar, then they'll give you a number (or not if its not busy) and bring your food to you"}
{"text":"The Harmony - or the Har Bar as my friends call it, is always an inviting and friendly place to have a beer.  It's a neighborhood bar in the truest sense of the word, locals walk and bike to the place which is situated in one of the greatest areas of Madison.  The food is really nice, an up-scaled bar menu.  The signature dish, the \"Walnut Burger\" is truly fantastic.  Forget about it as a meat-alternative, this burger is a unique creation all its own that will make you have desperate cravings.  The space is large, divided in two, one half the main bar area and the other a large space with family-style tables where groups gather and bands sometimes play at night.  Here you will find the livers of the pure Madison lifestyle celebrating their lives.  These people are happy and they might just make you happy too."}
{"text":"I have loved the Harmony for years, but I'm so disappointed in the food lately. $7.25 for a mediocre cheeseburger (no fries)?! And $10.50 for a chicken caesar salad, which consisted of a tiny bowl of limp romaine, no croutons, and a sad chicken breast. Had I opted for just the caesar salad (no chicken), I would have been paying $8 for dressing and limp lettuce. This is Madison, guys. You gotta up your game (or seriously lower your prices)."}
{"text":"The Harmony grows on you. For a bar of its kind (neighborhood, slightly older demographics on the whole, cheapish), the food is great. 

I am addicted to the walnut burger with cheese. It is vegetarian and one of two or three dishes I'll really miss when I leave Madison. The chips and blue cheese dip are also awesome. I've tried many other dishes on the menu, and the Harmony is great about having fresh specials, many of which are vegetarian. They've all been good to great.

I love sitting at the bar. This is a bar that no matter your gender, you can go and eat alone at and not feel odd or out of place. The bartenders (who function as servers) are neither overly friendly nor out of sight. They are attentive, but leave you appropriately alone while you are eating and drinking.

Although I don't have kids, I am often with those who have them, and this is a great place to bring kids. They can run around the back room and on Fridays, you'll find lots of other kids. 

This is also a great place to watch sports events. The other week, I called up and asked if the bartenders would put the Tour de France on for me and a couple of friends, and he said yes and gave us free reign of the large-screen tv in the back.

Oh yes--bring cash, although there is an ATM if you forget to."}
{"text":"Harmony, I blame you for my insatiable craving for a walnut burger coupled with your hot blue cheese chips and a Spotted Cow.

Oh.My.God. Fantastic!!!

Harmony is also great as a local hang out with the neighborhood guys and gals. Super comfy atmosphere, live music, & clean bathrooms.

All very good."}
{"text":"Attended Harmony bar to watch the Peoples Brothers Band.  The band was great and I was awarded 3rd place in their costume contest.  I ordered several drinks at this establishment and it was never clear to me what the beer selections were. Regardless, the bartenders seemed friendly enough and it was a fun place for a show."}
{"text":"The Walnut Burger w/ blue cheese and onion rings rock. Alaskan Amber to quench the hirst."}
{"text":"I just can't handle the poor, huffy service anymore. The food is good- but there is better to be had and with a smile."}
{"text":"This is where YELP gets odd - any idea the demographics for the other reviewers? 

As a neighborhood bar, yes you are expected to behave - and geez, not having easy tabs going and having to pay as you go may be a pain. But really?! there's a cash machine right next to the pool table. Do the owners have a right to close down when it's bar time, indeed. 

What a bunch of whinners!

Drinks are served well and timely. Food is good. Better than good - hot, made to order, and fresh. 

Kids are expected to behave (and ours have been reminded as have we - good for all). Do we go there for yummy, fun times with friends, yes! Are we grateful a local, privately owned business maintains it's unique flavors. Yes! 

Cheers to the Harmony!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood bar. It is dependable and predictable. My favorite dish is the chicken breast plate with the Asian noodles. The chicken is moist and flavorful every time. I love their homemade chips with blue cheese but I try to steer clear. I always pray that someone else at the table will order them and I can sneak a few . Stolen food has no calories... Really."}
{"text":"I just moved across the street from HB&G this summer! Yay!

I've been a few times over the last few years, checked in once, and have been satisfied to want to come back again and again. This bar is quintessential Wisconsin meets the beauty of Madison's local food and flavor scene! Strange, right? Well, get on board. The atmosphere, food, is in perfect harmony! 

See what I did there? ;)

Okay... eat the veggie burger. It really is the very best I have ever tasted in Dane County! Veggie burgers are like donuts and cheese curds to me - I have a top 3 best of each in the greater Madison area. The veg burger is unreal. Light mayo, light sriracha,, swiss AND cheddar. You're ready to rock and roll!
 
I cannot recall the name of the pizza I've tried aside from the \"regular\" cheese pizza, but it was the pesto with both sausage and mushroom combo. AMAZING. Nearly all local ingredients really does add to the overall food experience. And for a bar...the pesto flavor is just lovely. Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!

Now, it wouldn't be Wisconsin without a review of the fried food. It's all indulgent. Fries, Yum. Rings, yum. Curds, yum. 

Check this place out in the summer months too! There's bluegrass tunes to be had.

The staff is in tune with the friendly meets 'got things to do\" vibe, and two pool tables are offered in the bar area. There is an entire multi-use space across the way, which for varying game day scenes is lit up!"}
{"text":"I like bars that are a little rough around the edges, but they don't usually have good food.  Harmony, on the other hand, manages to come through quite nicely in the food department.

I had a walnut burger and an order of their potato chips which they apparently make fresh.  The burger was great.  Large but not too large, a little bit messy, and just the right amount of toppings.  The chips were great too... at first.  Though I have to say that they started to feel a bit heavy about half way through.  They're still good, just be warned that if you eat an entire thing of chips your heart might explode."}
{"text":"The unfriendly atmosphere at The Harmony Bar is its biggest failing.  At first I thought it was just sarcastic \"Soup Nazi\" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.

Also, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  

The kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.

In short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.  There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The \"Harmony\"."}
{"text":"Some of the best bar food in the state.  Burgers and Pizza are always a fantastic choice.  Entertainment is hit or miss, but at least they have some.  However, my favorite reason to go here is it serves the coldest tap beer ever!!!"}
{"text":"Oh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!  I never miss a chance to grab a walnut burger and hot chips when I'm back in town.  

This is just a wonderful neighborhood bar.  The food is still \"bar\" food but it's quality, tasty and made fresh to order.  The pizza is good, too.  Good beer selection and a truly local atmosphere.  The Harmony fits right into the vibe of the neighborhood.

Oh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!"}
{"text":"I was here in August at noon time during the week and was not impressed. The woman bartender/server gave us the impression she would rather be somewhere else. Not exactly rude but not friendly either. The food was not of the quality it used to be either. Jump ahead to the first week of January, a Sunday around noon. The bartender was a guy that used to work here long ago who was always friendly and seems to fit the place perfectly. I don't know his name but remember him well. My wife and I both had the BBQ pork sandwich which came on a perfect sesame bun with a pickle and coleslaw. All good. The chips and blue cheese  were like they always were, Great! To be honest, we were going to remove this place off our list of places to go if the food and service wasn't' up to par and now we won't. I hope who ever owns the place now will keep an eye on the food and service so  that us old loyal customers don't give it a thumbs down. That one previous bartender in August is all it takes to start a landslide of customers who will not go back. Hopefully  she is gone or retrained to be nice. Thats all it takes."}
{"text":"This is an absolute delight for a dive in bar. Food was pretty on point. We tried the crispy cheese curds and their signature walnut burger which was such a welcome change for a vegetarian burger. Price wise it doesn't necessarily resonate with the dive in feeling but it's worth it. They have a big menu for pizza which they stop serving by 8pm (strange?) we tried the Moscow miles with vodka and gin and they were both good. Don't expect a wide selection of beer taps but sufficient to suit your fancy. The best part about the place was the live music and the awesome elderly couples classically dancing waltz. We were lucky to get some dancing tips while we showcased our skills ;) all in all, we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic neighborhood bar. The pizza is some of the best in town (the Greek pizza, ftw) and the rotating specials keep things interesting. Tap list is pretty steady and doesn't switch up too much, but the bottle list is always nice.

I come in fairly often and the staff is always aces. Great atmosphere to catch a badgers game.

On top of everything, the music schedule is phenomenal. A steady supply of Madison bands (not nearly enough People Brothers Band) and other acts from around the Midwest. The vibe is always chill, and the cover is never more than $7 or $8 (if there even is one). Definitely one of my favorite spots in town."}
{"text":"I'm not quite certain how I haven't reviewed Harmony yet, as it is literally one of my favorite divey bars in Madison. They have, quite possibly, one of the best veggie burgers in town. Like, literally, if I go to long without their walnut burger I get withdrawals. Also, the fresh chips and nachos are greasy heaven! The beer list is pretty solid and pretty locally made Madison/WI beers. This is a great bar to go to if you want a laid back, friendly environment with hella good food and beer!"}
{"text":"Good old fashioned Wisconsin Bar.  Locals flock to the place. Great food and service. Cheese curds...yummy , bratwurst yummy, grilled cheese hello...yummo.

Not fancy but who needs it??"}
{"text":"First rate bar food, better than many restaurants and priced right. You cant go wrong. Under new ownership but this hasn't affected quality. Great blues bar too."}
{"text":"This is such a fabulous neighborhood bar!! I love that fact that families come here,from wee ones to grandparents...all to either have a Friday Night Fish Fry together or to watch a Badger game, either way, it has a lovely family atmosphere here! But BEST of all?! The STAFF! Ohmigosh!!! I've NEVER been to a bar/restaurant/what-have-you that has NICER staff who are always SMILING and loving life!! This, alone, has me coming back here! My first visit here, I was chatting with a \"regular\" while trying to decide what to order, and was ethusiastically steered into the direction of the nachos! Score! I ordered the beef nachos and they were STELLAR! Flavorful and plentiful in toppings!! My dinner companion ordered the Walnut Burger (how can you not?? This is raved about in the reviews!)...SCORE!!! Again, flavorful and filling without the heaviness of a beef burger! I, also, tried a cup of soup, Italian Meatball...wow. Just the right amount of seasoning, thick and delish!! Lastly...$4.50 draft pints! Hellloooo!!! Can't wait to stop back in for their well-reviewed pizzas!!"}
{"text":"This is a focused review on their pizza.

I am a big fan and I am surprised I have not written about this earlier.

First, it is a solid neighborhood bar, with music at least once a week if not more.  The beer selection is okay, not great.  The service is always OUTSTANDING!!  But I digress, the pizza.

Love it!  They have a sweeter sauce that I think is delicious.  The pizza comes out quickly too, so I recommend you mosey on up to the bar, grab a beer, order the pizza and enjoy the clientele during the wait.  The mushroom and caramelized onions were are good combo.  I did do the Canadian Bacon in the past, but it was basically chunks of ham and not desirable.  Otherwise, do yourself a favor and go pizza hunting!  Oh and order by 7:30 or 8 pm otherwise....NO PIZZA FOR YOU!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a classic Wisconsin Tavern and I enjoyed watching football at the Harmony.  No bullshit here."}
{"text":"Great little local bar. Bike racks out front. Had a cheeseburger and a local beer. Hey have music on weekends. This was a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Wisconsin style Old Fashioned made with oj instead of oranges made for an odd bitter chemical tasting cocktail. Then I ordered curds that weren't good, either. Pretty sure I was overcharged for these as $14 seems pricey for curds and a crappy cocktail. Bummer because this was one of my haunts back in the day! One extra star because if nothing else at least I didn't feel awkward sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Great local place in the Atwood neighborhood. Pizzas are amazing, as are the pretzels. Keith and staff do a great job. Plenty of local brews on tap."}
{"text":"I'm truly a carnivore at heart, but the walnut burger at The Harmony is quite spectacular & totally unique - great flavor, great texture and totally satisfying. Paired with a side of hot chips & blue cheese dip, you've got a delicious and memorable meal."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you  feel welcome and relaxed as soon as you get there. I enjoy the food, the walnut burger was super different and interesting, and although I prefer the beef it was fun to try something different.
The rest of the food was as good as bar food gets, but the staff and general feel of the bar (I love the old school jukebox!) makes it 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"The perfect place for the near-east side. Good to very good drinks (depending on the bar tender) and yummy pub food -- especially the walnut burger. It has a workaday feel, with a side of liberal politics and an accepting and welcoming attitude. Somehow it's not overpopulated with posers which makes it just about my favorite place in town."}
{"text":"First time here. I had the WI brat and hubby had the BBQ pork sandwich - both were packed with flavor! The environment is casual and we had fun people watching :) Best part is, it's right on the capital bike trail.

I do wish we had known it was cash only though - they do have an atm with a $2 charge. Remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"A no frills, order at the bar, cash only place with a friendly staff, great bar vibe, excellent local beers and a nice sized menu containing the Walnut Burger...The best burger I have ever had in my life...and I have had it many many times. If the Atwood neighborhood had to be summed up in one place, this would be the one."}
{"text":"If I could give the Harmony less than one star, I would. I live in the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood, so I'm not writing as an outsider. I've been to the Harmony many times, but I'm finally done being abused by the notoriously unfriendly owner, bartenders and waitstaff at the Harmony. The Harmony is worse than Seinfeld's Soup Nazi because there's no irony or humor in being treated the way the employees here treat their customers. 

I won't get into specifics. I can only say that I take pride in my neighborhood. My wife and I frequent those establishments that understand that they are part of a community and treat their paying customers as such. The Harmony is a black mark on our neighborhood, and I am ashamed that unsuspecting visitors to the quaint east side should have to endure the abusive, disrespectful and generally unapologetic service at this establishment. If you scroll down you'll read other comments about the owner's girlfriend who is now manager. The last time I was in there with a group of friends, she couldn't have been more rude or insulting. When we all said we wouldn't be back, she merely shrugged her shoulders. 

If you're visiting the East Side, there are plenty of other places that serve great food with friendly service. Alchemy, Mickey's, Wilson's, The Weary Traveller all come to mind as places that will make you feel and taste the love on the East Side.  If you're a masochist, be sure to head on over The Harmony for your daily dose of abuse. 

You've been warned. You certainly won't catch me sitting at this bar ever again."}
{"text":"I've had some decent experiences here throughout my life.  Many friends work there etc.  Good neighborhood spot.  Solid 7/10 bar food that won't blow your mind.  Some servers and bartenders are nicer than others.  Also this place has some good live music and is somewhat famous for blues acts.  It's a good place to go if you live in the hood but I would skip if if you are visiting."}
{"text":"What's the first thing that comes to mind to have for dinner before going fire-dancing with friends on the summer solstice? Brats, right? Of course! What? No? It's just me? Well, that's what happens when you're at Olbrich Beach catching some rays and are subjected to the craving-inducing scents from 1,000 Father's Day celebration BBQs going on at the park. 

Surprisingly it's not that easy to find a local place on the east side that you can just walk into and order a brat. Enter Harmony, the harbinger of good things to come. I'm not one who enjoys going out alone, especially to bars, but that's something I'm trying to get over. So it was a relief to see the place only half filled with low key, relaxed people who barely noticed I was there. I was however, immediately noticed by the friendly, smiling young bartender (who looked all of fourteen), so I was put further at ease. Also delightful was a live band playing happy zydeco music in the other room, a genre which I adore. I sat at the bar and ordered my 'beer brat'. With sauerkraut, it's only $5.25. Win! They also had a fairly good selection of craft brews on tap, and mine was cold and delicious. Brat, beer and fries for $12.

The brat is pre-cooked and then browned in the tiny kitchen just off the bar, and it's always fun to watch food being made (if you're me). They also grill the kraut, a nice touch. It's served on a big, somewhat fluffy sesame seed bun, which seemed like an odd choice, but it worked. The fries are good, too, and the order is huge. I would have sprung for the deservedly popular pub chips and bleu cheese dip, but they were twice the price of the fries. It was a lot of food, and totally satisfying, and I finished every last bite. I think this is a place I can feel comfortable going to alone or with others in the future, and I plan to, often. :-)

Note: cash only.
Five stars instead of four if only they had a fire grill and not just a flat grill."}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome whether you go walnut or regular. Prompt, attentive staff. Great beers on tap. No snobs and the place has a sense of humor about itself. It's good stuff."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Housemade chips to die for. Great staff. Interesting locals. Although known for their pizza, tonight's was just ok. Other sandwiches and soups are better in my opinion. Love the bbq pork and slaw. The rosemary chicken is fab as well. Laid back, tolerant atmosphere. Always have the right games on. Never need to ask. :)"}
{"text":"The bartenders/staff on a Friday night are outstanding. They are in to what they do and that makes a difference having someone that is attentive and friendly. good mix of tap beers (couple IPAs) and cannot go wrong with their pizza. Reasonably priced. one area of improvement when they don't have bands. let the employees be in control of the music. It can get loud in there and be nice to tune out a few loud patrons. They are probably tired of the jukebox selections anyhow. (I am :)Oh also I have seen some stingy people tip there. Come on old folks they are working hard. Change is not acceptable in this day in age!"}
{"text":"Harmony bar and grill is aptly named for being a harmony of so many things 
1) Music - there is usually live music. Definitely on weekends and on most weekdays. 
2) Dance Floor - right in front of the stage there is an area designated for dancing. On a weekend we had a lot of couples on the floor jiving and waltzing
3) Food - pizza - most reviews talk about their pizza. I didn't try those since we weren't in the mood for pizza. But most patrons kept raving about it. Point to note - it closes earlier than the bar 
4) Food - Grill - this again closes earlier than the bar. But what caught my attention was the walnut burger that was their most awarded. It is a veggie burger patty made with bread, spices and walnuts. It is a must have with blue cheese dressing and what I went for tonight. 
5) SheepsHead - harmony is known for the owner and friends playing this game. They have been playing it for more than 2 decades and have their own tournament and winners plaques decorating the wall. You can read more about the game at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheepshead_(game)
6) Other Games - pool table and slots for die hard fans of the games. One table and two machines doesn't give you a lot of choice. But available if you feel the itch"}
{"text":"I started going here on and off about eight years ago. The pizza is the best, but the burgers (veggie and regular) are very good as well. It's bar food at its very best. Hot chips with dipping sauce are good too! There's often bands on the weekends, and the occasional lesbian after bowling league get together, but not angry, man-hating, shemales. Quite a few different groups of people get together for good beer, food and music at reasonable prices."}
