{"text":"This place is incredible. Hands down most delicious  \"fast food\"  Chinese restaurant in the East Valley. Wow! I ordered the 2 item combo and I got a heaping portion of Orange and General Tso's chicken, white rice, chow mien, and an egg roll for $5.95. I went here at 9:15pm on a Sunday also. I would recommend this place to anyone and am happy to say that I will be eating here much more often."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. I have never in my life had to go through what I went through with this restaurant I ordered my dinner and I open my food and the meat was not in the dish I called to let them know and basically I was called a lier I was told that they put the meat in the dish and I told her it was not there .So they tell me to bring it up there to prove that the meat was not there.So I did and the look on her face was priceless because like I said the meat? was not there.So I asked for my money back and she tells me that they are remaking my order no apologie but I was to wait for my food after I had to drive 40 minutes I said no I just wanted my money and I will never be back again.So long story short don't spend your money here it's not worth it the the attitude and bad delivery and bad service is not worth your time or money.And the food is not that good it was just convenient because they deliver."}
{"text":"We ordered a takeaway of szechwan chicken and sesame chicken. Sesame chicken was huge pieces of fried chicken along with some sweet sauce which was given separately. This is entirely different from what I have imagined. They could have at least served the dish as a whole instead of asking me to mix the sauce with fried chicken. Coming to the taste I could not even finish one piece of fried chicken. The szechwan chicken was also below average. I had prepared my dinner after this. Nothing looked or tasted good except for packaging. Worst take away experience."}
{"text":"Kung POW!  Stopped in for first time to try some wonton soup and lunch.  Excellent! Ordered the 2-item combo with Kung Pao Chicken and Orange Chicken. Comes with rice,  chow me in and fortune cookie.  Love the wonton soup.  Kung Pao had nice spice and all very hot and fresh.  Very filling with leftovers for under $10 and super yummy. I'll be back."}
{"text":"THEY CHARGE MORE THAN THEIR MENU  Just this week we had a menu delivered to our home. So we placed an order which before tax should total 22.05. They bill me for 29.32. (All before a $3 off coupon). I requested an itemized receipt so I could see the charges and they hand me a receipt that has the items ordered and a total. NO values and NO line for tax added. We will never order again- if they can't be trusted with the small things, how can I trust them with the important things in food prep?"}
{"text":"It took a couple of months for the new owners to get settled in at the China Express.  Now, it is a great take-out place.  It is best to call ahead, especially in the evening around 6:00 since their popularity has grown.  We have been there several times and have found the owner and his wife to be friendly and accommodating.  The shrimp dishes are one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Yelp users said it was bad and they were spot on! How do you mess up beef fried rice and spare ribs. Pretty basic stuff. My bag smelled like cigarette smoke, the food was luke warm and just gross. The rice was over cooked. the beef was chunky and fatty and the ribs were just cold and gross. I took 2 bites and set it aside for the trash. I only went here because the other Chinese place in Lakewood does not deliver and i was desperate. Never again!!!! Listen to me don't do it."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the bad reviewers, this place is great!! I think it is one of the best fast food chinese places in Lakewood & I have tried several. Good prices, online ordering option (beyond menu), quick service for pick-up, great options for vegetarians, & delicious. I have never had a bad meal or experience here, so check it out! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I should have listened to all the yelp reviewers. It's really a waste of money...as you will see.  THe chicken was overcooked. I could barely chew it. it was like rubber. Honest! Rice was ok."}
{"text":"Great food, every time. The people are friendly and the prices are reasonable. Their fried rice is the best!"}
{"text":"Alright portions for the price. Very quick service!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a tasty spot.... I would recommend this place if your looking for something different and good.  Real Asian environment :)"}
{"text":"I spent over $50 to feed my friends and family their food on a takeout order. Everything was good, good as usual, except for the order of Pork Lomien Noodles. It smelled sour when I got it home (5 minutes after I picked it up). I tasted it and the meat was rancid. I've been a customer of their's for the past year and I've never had a problem with their food. I returned to the store with the Pork Lomien noodles thinking that I was doing them a favor by alerting them to the problem so they wouldn't serve it to anymore of their customers. When I explained the problem to the manager, she refused to smell the lomien noodles. She refused to give me a refund for just the pork lomien noodles and she refused to make me another order. I told her that her attitude was uncalled for and she dared me to call the Health Department because in her words \"we make everything fresh!\" I told her that she was being ridiculous and that I would be making a complaint and she said \"f@#k you! Get out my store!\" I don't know what her issue is, but I will never give them another dime of my money. Absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"One of My favorite places for Chinese! Plenty of food and it's always yummy! Super friendly too!"}

{"text":"I just ordered from another Chinese delivery place and their crappy food inspired me to leave a good review for China Express. I am giving this 4 stars based on how it sizes up to every other Chinese restaurant's food that I've had delivered to my house. Maybe that is not setting the bar that high, because in my experience, Chinese delivery is generally on par with fast food like McDonald's or Taco Bell. But when I am craving some Chinese delivery because I am too damn lazy to get off the couch and get some \"real\" food, this is always a place I come back to. I love being able to order online, I love all of the discounts I get depending on what I order, I love that I can avoid cooking dinner while simultaneously avoiding having to leave my house."}
{"text":"Called for delivery.   Quick delivery but every package was either leaking or broken. Sauce all over the bag and contents spilling everywhere.   In addition the food was bland - even for Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"Love it! best chinese in lakewood. the guy at the cashier was super friendly and the food was very good!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. I am SO upset. I ordered food at 7:15pm, it is now 9:22pm. I have called 3 times and each time they have said they were on their way. I live less than a mile away. I am totally furious and even if the food ever does arrive, it's going to be cold and disgusting. Don't go here. Save yourself the anguish. Especially if you are extra hungry and have no food in the house, they will just make your family starve."}
{"text":"Ordered the sesame chicken and the general tso's chicken, one in the same really, but both still delicious. Would have given 5 stars but it took 56 minutes for delivery and they forgot my 3 free crab rangoon with purchase of $17 or more!"}
{"text":"Love this place this is mine and my husband's absolute favorite Chinese restaurant except for a place out in Scottsdale that we like a lot too. The food has always been fresh every time we've gone they don't cook it until you order it very consistent we've been going here for years and have never had anything to be upset about also their dining room is very clean. Oh yeah and they deliver"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure! So DELICIOUS! Small buffet. But it has amazing selection and awesome pineapple chicken, general's chicken, beef and broccoli, crab Rangoon, noodles, fried rice, and even some American favorites like mozzarella sticks, corn nuggets, fries, and chicken wings. Its ALL YOU CAN EAT! When you order in. And their to go buffet boxes hold a very generous amount of food. I can generally get more than one meal out of a to go buffet. Very reasonably priced. I paid less than 7 dollars for the dine in lunch buffet. I Love this place!!! The staff is very kind and the right amount of friendly and professional"}
{"text":"I'm being generous with one star!  Place is a wreck. Dirty, unkempt, lost in the 80s.  Food was barely edible. Owner should be ashamed!  Disgusting! Apparently people don't have very high standards! Nothing is appetizing about this place"}
{"text":"CONSISTENTLY good food! Our typical order is Hot &Sour soup, Wonton soup, Pepper steak, Beef LoMein, and Szechuan beef combo (fried rice and an eggroll) You can understand the female owner when she takes your order and she's very friendly in-store. This place is within a mile of our home and is our go-to place EVERY TIME for Chinese."}
{"text":"Not only did they get my order wrong and overcharge me, the food was bland and tasteless. I ordered from them during the summer and found a Canadian Soldier in the Lo Mein. I thought I would give them another chance...BOY WAS I WRONG! At LEAST the Lo Mein had a little flavor! STAY AWAY AT ALL COASTS! They don't deserve your hard earned money."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal or experience at China Express.  The orders are always fast and accurate.  UPDATE:  They used to have the best fried rice.  They changed the chicken they use recently, and now it tastes like wax.    I miss the old food.  Guess it's time to move on."}
{"text":"The first 2 times we ordered it was OK, but then they forgot to include free noodles, then again they forgot to put something in our order. The last time we got chicken wings they were already cooked twice! They looked dry, over fried and old. The taste was awful! 2 orders went straight to the garbage bin. Won't recommend, not going back there!"}
{"text":"Oy...have to downgrade. Which is unfortunate, since China Express has recently developed an online ordering system which is very convenient (and they deliver for free).  However, I found three little shards of plastic in my food yesterday. Not. Cool. It was probably from a plastic fork or something they used to stir...maybe? I'm hoping, because I'm kind of afraid of what else it could be.  Gross.  But the food still tastes good to me."}
{"text":"Not great food but not bad either. It's typical Americanized Chinese cuisine. They do deliver and for me that's a huge benefit. They offer all of the typical entrees and their portions are generous.   I just upgraded my review to five stars because TS' bitchy review. I have been ordering food from this establishment for three years and have never had any issues. I think TS is a scumbag."}
{"text":"Food is good its just kind of a long wait. Nothing more really. Dine in is small so don't bring a large party. I suggest you call ahead for a pickup"}
{"text":"Pretty good Asian food. Pretty bomb prices! I always get the orange chicken. So delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a very up and down place and this review will try to cover both the ups and the downs. The basic premise of the place is fast take out. In many ways, it reminds me of places I've visited in the outer boroughs of New York City. Upon entering the space, you see a few small tables at which you can sit. While I suppose you could eat your food here, it appears to be mostly space to allow people to wait for the food to be cooked and turned over.  The main counter goes across most of the space, with a small gap to allow the staff to come in and out. Above the counter are photos of what some of the dishes are supposed to look like. These are clearly stock photos and have nothing to do with what the place offers. When you stand at the counter, you can see straight through to the back so you can view all the action in the kitchen. During my visit, the cook was working the woks and a woman was taking orders and bagging them. There is a stack of paper menus on the left side of the counter, so I used one of them to decide on what to get.  The first upside was that they have a variety of different fillings for their egg rolls. Vegetarian, and chicken based egg rolls are always available as are shrimp ones. The first downside was that they came out very greasy - I mean after taking a bite, oil rolled out of the egg roll, rolled down my hand and dripped on to the plate!  We also tried their hot and sour soup. A generous portion of it could not make up for the complete lack of any kind of heat. Unlike most of these offerings around the area, this one seemed to have more carrots than I've ever seen leaving the impression of this soup being orange in color (see the photos I uploaded to get a sense of what I mean).  The next dishes we tried were the Garlic Chicken and the Ginger Chicken. On the menu, one is listed in red ink which is supposed to denote that it has some spice to it. You really have to look carefully to determine which is which. Both dishes had the exact same cuts of chicken and same collections of vegetable ingredients. If you really looked carefully, you could see strands of ginger in the one, and some small polka dots in the other. Flavor wise, they were very very similar, with the polka-dotted one being sweeter. Spice? What spice?  The final upside was that they have something that they call \"sesame balls\". I asked what those were and was gratified to hear that they were red bean paste filled buns that are then coated in sesame seeds and fried. These were absolutely excellent! Even though they were also fried, they were totally not greasy unlike the egg rolls.  So, what do I make of this place? It basically offers the same things as most every other American-Chinese restaurants and is hardly distinguishable from their competitors. If it's more convenient for you to get takeout from here, than that could be what determines your choice. I am not sure why they do not offer delivery service, but they do not. As the rating shows, it's OK, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I order from here a few times a month and the food is always outstanding. The dumplings are delicous, their general tsos chicken and lomein are always spot on. (Their pork is definitely better than the competition, I'm very picky with pork). This is my favorite Chinese in the area and the other local places which I have frequented don't come close.  10/10 will eat here again."}
{"text":"Very very good! My new go to spot for Chinese. Very friendly and clean! Also the chicken with broccoli is wonderful all white meat no fatty pieces and just overall yummy! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese restaurant! I love supporting family owned restaurants. I've been coming here for many years, the food is always  fresh and I have never had a bad experience. The mongolian beef here is my absolute favorite! Great customer service! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"No stars, don't order from this company, if your a america looking for work don't go here. They will take advantage of you while saying you will make a lot of money. I drove over 100 miles and delivered 50 orders in the Lakewood area and did not get paid one dime. 4 weeks later they said it was my interview. Work for free wear and tear on my car and rack count less miles and spent you're own money on gas. For free."}
{"text":"The food is great, prices are good, and delivery is fast! We have never received a wrong order!"}
{"text":"Nice quality. Typical menu. I love their house special egg foo young and their almond cookies. The cookies are often delivered warm. Mmm. Polite delivery folks. Fairly quick."}
{"text":"This place has changed hands since my last review, and things went downhill fast after that. While the menu is the same, the people cooking are not doing a good job. The food is heavy and way too greasy. I thought at first that the original owners were on vacation, and this was corraborated by the man I spoke with, although we both may have just been victims of a language barrier. Anyway, it looks like the old guard is gone and the new is here to stay, and that's bad news for this establishment. Alas."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 combination dinners for delivery. Price was great. Phone order was painless unlike a previous reviewer. Delivery to mint hill was very timely. Portion was adequate. Regular fried rice has veggies unlike some other places. Food overall was good. No complaints about sesame chicken, pork fried rice was great. Lo Mein was described as \"just ok\". Egg rolls were good. I am mainly writing this review because I was hesitant to order from here after seeing a 2.5 star rating but after my experience I have no complaints and wanted to give this place a boost."}
{"text":"This place as absolutely ridiculous when it comes to delivering food. First of all when you call the language barrier is frustrating you have too repeat things several times so you are frustrated before you even hang up EVERY Time I order from this restaurant they forget something tonight rice, last time wontons and egg rolls. And when you call back you get to listen to the screaming children in the background while they discuss your order they come back on and say oh sorry you want it next time? NO I WANT IT NOW I want what I ordered and paid for. \"Well its going to be another hour before we can get it back. SERIOUSLY? And they will bring the rice and nothing else. Not even a free we are sorry egg roll. The food is pretty good but all this frustration every single time we order is not worth it!"}
{"text":"Huge portions.  Food was made quick and was pretty tasty.  That being said, it was American Chinese Cuisine.  Not too much different from Panda Express, but more food, tasted better, and was a bit cheaper.  I would take my food to go.  Atmosphere in the restaurant is not very good."}
{"text":"I've always had pretty good food here. It's your average Chinese take out place. I really like the moo goo gai pan and their egg drop soup. My orders have always been hot and ready when I arrive within 15 min. I've never had a problem with them getting it right."}
{"text":"Just had a sweet & sour chicken combo dinner and I regret ordering it so much. The rice taste like plastic... I am not exaggerating a bit. It lacked so much flavor. The chicken was incredibly chewy and tasted like old grease. I'm not expecting gourmet but the food was horrible. I now have tried every Chinese spot in Lakewood and have come to the conclusion if I want decent Chinese food I need to look outside of Lakewood. Sucks but I will never order from here or any Lakewood Chinese restaurant again."}
{"text":"The food is OK. Nothing special. Not much to eat in Rantoul so it was just ok. The part that bothers me about this place is its extremely dirty. The ketchup bottle was disgusting. They should be ashamed of putting that out. You know how you can tell.of a place is clean. Look at the bathroom. And this bathroom was scary."}
{"text":"Ordered the General Tsos Chicken lunch special. The flavor is great because the chicken is seasoned before it is sauced. However, these are huge chicken tender like chunks. I didn't like that. Additionally, the chicken was not completely sauced. It seems like they put the sauce on the chicken once it was in the dish instead of tossing it.  If they had smaller chunks of fully sauced chicken, they would receive a 5 star review."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food around!! It's inexpensive, but delicious!!  Can't beat this hole-in-the-wall, mom & pop place!!! Mmmmm"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place as it was on my way home from work and we had a taste for Chinese Food.  Unfortunately, after waiting 25 minutes for take out we did not get very good tasting food.    Some observations:  1. Customer service:  Practically non existent.  I watched the woman behind the counter snap at people on the phone and make nasty comments after hanging up.  There were many people calling asking where their food was because it had been over an hour and she was arguing with them regarding the length of time they had waited.  She would continue talking about how \"dumb\" they were after hanging up.  I heard her say to one person, \"just cancel your order if you don't like\".  She was irritated with us for asking about the order we had been told would take 10-15 minutes when it was at 25 minutes.  2.  Portion size:  We got a 3 person family dinner.  The containers with the General Tso chicken, shredded beef Szchewan and moo goo gai pan had VERY LITTLE meat in them, had vegetables flooded with sauce and half filled with rice, in addition to the separate containers of rice.  The dinner was primarily rice that was greasy.  The egg rolls, were greasy, half filled crusts and fairly limp.  There was not enough real food to feed a family of three.  3.  Taste:  POOR.  Very little taste.  There was no spice in the sczhewan and the General Tso chicken was mainly breading.  The soup as salty water.  We will not be ordering there again."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and after trying the other Chinese food establishments nearby this one is my favorite. It's not a big operation, I only ever see the same two people, but they are both nice and the food is prepared consistently.  I can vouch for the general tso's shrimp and chicken, the amazing chicken, the crab rangoon, and pan fried dumplings. The one major drawback of this place is that they don't deliver but I find it to be worth the drive."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  We had heard good things.  I called asking about combo dinner specials and ordered 4 - a beef w/brocolli, Shrimp w/lobster sauce, chix lo mein, and sesame chicken, along with an appetizer of crab rangoons. which totalled $35.  The whole time I was trying to give my order, there was a baby making noise really close to phone.  I asked her to repeat the order back and she said 4 combos and rangoons.  I got there 20 minutes later and picked up my order.  At a quick glance, it looked right.  We got back home and the beef with broccoli is actually shrimp with broccoli, so no dinner for me at all (i don't eat seafood).  After hearing my husband and daughters describe theirs as flavorless and watching them eat 3 bites and throw them out, I figured I did not miss out on much.  Oh, and that baby was on the cashier's hip and slamming on the cash register when I got there.  Are you running a business or a day care?  I am all about family business and always try to support locally run establishments.  The two kids doing their homework in the dining room are one thing, but you are serving me my food while this baby drools all over everything....not acceptable, especially when it leads to me not getting the correct order."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. It was awesome! I ordered sweet and sour shrimp, triple schezuan extra spicy combination, chicken and shrimp Mei fun, and beef sticks.  The beef sticks were huge! They were very tasty! The egg roll was tasty as well.  The s n s shrimp were large and tasty, but we're a little under done. The dough wasn't all the way cooked, but that didn't stop me. The Mei fun was great! The star, however, was the schezuan! The flavor was out of this world! I asked for extra spicy, and this was by far the most spicy out of any other Chinese restaurants. It wasn't as spicy as I wanted, but I don't think I'll stop that quest until my esophagus has a hole burning through it.  The restaurant was small, but very clean. The woman behind the desk was awesome! She even gave me a free 2 liter of coke because it was my first visit. I think I've found my new favorite Chinese spot!"}
{"text":"I've never been to the actual location or even seen it but I've ordered delivery from here twice and it is great!  The food is fresh and tastes exactly how I crave it to taste, which is important to me with Chinese food. I ordered from another place in between both my orders from here and that place was such a major let down that I was ashamed in myself for not ordering from here. The other place offered a coupon that pulled me in but this place pulls me in by the food alone, without coupons! From what I can tell, this place is slightly cheaper than other nearby places with the same rating also. You can get a lot of food from here for $30-$40. I usually order something from each meat category, and then a chow mien and crab puffs. Comes with rice, so you don't need to order that separate. They are located like a mile and a half down the road from me so delivery is pretty quick as well and all the food containers are in a cardboard box thing that makes it easier to carry vs the other place that gave me my food in a messy crappy paper bag that could barely hold everything. Also the delivery guy is very nice. Definitely my go to for Chinese delivery! And you can order online!"}
{"text":"Ughhh I'm so full!!!! Hearty portions. Unlike most takeout, this food was actually flavorful. I think maybe the fried foods could have used a little more drying time as it was still a bit greasy. Nothing a napkin couldn't fix so it wasn't soggy greasy, just a little too much left over from the fryer. Didn't change my opinion on the food though. I got the shrimp spring roll which you could tell had actual shrimp in it, the wonton soup (the noodles do not have the pork in them which is totally okay with me because I pick it out anyway), crab rangoon  (YUM!), chicken fingers (which are a lot bigger than regular chicken fingers from Chinese resturants... a little heavy on the breading), and the chicken and shrimp lo mein which was absolutely amazing! The lo mein had a ton of different vegetables in it which I tend to see a lot of Chinese restaurants get a bit skimpy on. I also want to mention I definitely did not eat all of this food, when I order Chinese I also order enough for lunch the next day. I usually take a little bit of each per meal. The portions are so big that I will need my fiance to help me finish it all. I couldn't do it, even if I wanted to! Overall, great little Chinese restaurant. Highly recommend. Just be prepared for a lot of food when you do order (never a bad thing, just hope my food doesn't go to waste after ordering so much)."}
{"text":"My new favorite at China Express is Orange Chicken. Give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The delivery service is awful. I ordered 5 spring rolls with my order which they forgot to deliver. I called back and the lady said she put them with our order which isn't true since we didn't receive them. They said they would come back which they did but only gave us 1 spring roll. The food was fine but service is not good."}
{"text":"Was really excited about this place having all the great reviews however it did not meet my expectations the food was just ok kinda bland even I had the orange chicken and the sweet and sour pork I ordered the 3 item combo which by the way is not 3 entrees it is only 2 entrees and 2 veggie spring rolls so basically you don't get a choice for a 3rd option ..the best part of my meal was the mango smoothie that deserved 5 stars .. I don't think I'll be back but if u are looking for just an ok place to eat with good size portions I would recommend it"}
{"text":"That was the biggest waste of $40 I've ever spent.  Let's start with my order of egg rolls that were tiny spring rolls.  Got home and served it up to the family, I thought they were all going to kill me! The spring rolls that they mistakenly gave me were mush, the chow main was soggy, the beef and broccoli wash mushy and soggy. The crab puffs and orange chicken tasted like cardboard.  This place was without a doubt the worst Chinese food I've ever experienced. Pretty sad when I would take Panda Express 7 days a week over this place once!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to stumble upon this Chinese food place when I bought my house, and in almost 3 years it is the only place I will order from.  I have recommended it to many people, who now continue to choose this restaurant as their go-to Chinese Takeout place.    The food is always amazing, and there is plenty of it.  The menu is huge and includes many different options, including chicken tenders and french fries which have come in handy for picky children.  The delivery is generally quick, and to date I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Customer service is non existent. I called in & they didn't even say hello. Just over all rude, cheap people.  Don't understand how they're still open.  Never ordering here again."}
{"text":"Ordered 90 minutes ago.   They say it's on the way.   Still waiting.   From reading these reviews, I should have been warned.   Do yourself a favor and order from another delivery restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have eaten here twice.  The first time was pretty good so we decided to go back again.  When my boyfriend called in our order, he ordered 3 dinners and then asked for an extra eggroll, in which the guy taking the order replied,  you can't get an extra eggroll.  My boyfriend said why can't I get an extra eggroll, I'm going to pay for it,  then the guy says,  oh yeah,  if you're going  to pay for it you can - duhhhh, did he think we were expecting free food?!  Since when do you tell customers they can't have something off the menu, totally rude. After we picked up the order,  we got it home and tried to figure out the containers of food since it was too much trouble for the restaurant to label them, we actually had to taste the food to tell what it was.  As for the quality,  it was mediocre or less, I don't expect premium for the price we paid for this,  but I do expect hot and good, which it wasn't.  It was quite bland, and not hot throughout. My boyfriend asked for extremely hot and spicy,  and he said it wasn't spicy at all, and his was also bland.  We will not be returning to this restaurant, we were hoping that we would like this place since there is not that many good quality Chinese restaurants in Mint Hill and I think we've tried all the ones that are nearby . We loved the Tai Pei restaurant in Pineville when we lived over there, but it seems we cannot find a Chinese restaurant that we love (or even like) since we moved, the hunt continues."}
{"text":"I visited on December 22nd, 2015. The interior is interesting, as it has a mirror (I almost walked into the mirror believing it was extra seating). The staff behind the counter is very friendly. The Chinese food is tasty and I admire how generous the portions are. Unfortunately, their boba drinks do not consist of tea, but like most other places, liquid (water or milk), ice, and powder."}
{"text":"I am so glad we finally discovered China Express a few years ago after living in Parma for several years. We used to order from East China, but I was so tired of being treated poorly by the owner. The owner of China Express is so friendly and really appreciates your business. She remembers your name after a few visits and always holds a conversation with you when you pick up your food. Their food is exceptional! We have ordered several items on the menu and haven't been disappointed. I will continue to order from here and recommend it to all my local friends."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese take out but AMAZING service!! I did pick up. They were super friendly and even have me a free 2 liter of coke for being a first time customer! Will return for sure."}
{"text":"My general tso's chicken was pretty nasty! I kept biting into pieces of chicken that were so chewy, you just chewed on it for about half a minute until you finally spit it out. The white rice wasn't bad, but I was starving and the chicken turned me off."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna front -- this is a Chinese take-out place. It's cheap, it's fast, it's friendly, and I've never had any problem with the grub I've gotten from this place. It's the closest Chinese take-out to my apartment, which alone means that I've been to this place probably more times than I've been to my own kitchen. I wish they bottled that smell of fryer oil endemic to most Chinese take-outs. I would dab a bit behind my ears every morning."}
{"text":"Like Ace of Base says: I saw the Sign.  I read all my fellow Yelpers reviews and should of known.  Stopped here for lunch on my way home and got bourbon chicken and wonton.  Stuff I have ordered numerous times before.  I guess I am spoiled that First Wok in Euclid make super good versions of both.  THIS version on the other hand, not so much.  The bourbon chicken was breaded first off and tasted like orange chicken.  No amount of me chugging Makers Mark made this taste like bourbon but in the eternal words of Harland \"Colonel\" Sanders : \"Im too drunk to taste this chicken\"...which didnt hold true for me!  Also, the wonton broth had ZERO flavor and the wrappers they used were too thick and/or not cooked enough.  Typical with most Chinese take-away spots they are friendly but getting more that 2 packets of hot sauce requires an act of  Liu Fuling himself!  Stuff here is cheap but ya get what ya pay for.  I guess Ill follow the herd and buy my Chinese across the street like a good boy.."}
{"text":"??!  boh deen-wah johk.  I like this place.  Ordered takeaway here a few times here now and stuff is quick, cheap, hot and wrapped super well.  No dripping red mystery sauce on my El Camino seats!  Wonton could use a tad more flavor but hot n sour soup is some of the best Ive had.  Never had Cantonese pan-fried noodles until I had em on a whim from here.  These things changed my life!  Whatever that brown sauce they add to the pork and beef version is awesome.  Also, I tried Schezwan beef and it was equally as good!  Spicy and smokey.  My only regret is that I didnt order it without onions.  Onions are the devils foreskin.  As with most reviews I like to point out the positive then backhand em with reality.  This place does not have hot sauce packets...  The DO have \"hot sauce\"  but it comes in a cup and you have to pay extra.  Both times Ive had it its different.  This past time it was bitter and flavorless and NOT EVEN HOT!  The first time it was more like a sambal. I know we are in the Midwest and people have the flavor palet of a 5 yr old but some of us like it hot.  The compaines that make all that duck sauce crap also make HOT sauce.  Just buy a box and be done with it..  First Chinese spot in history that I have not seen that doesnt carry some sort of spicy goodness...  I will be back but next time I will just bring my own Sirracha aka. hipster ketchup..."}
{"text":"Food tasted great, but I Got very very sick after eating here. Twice. The first time, just a stomach ache, when I decided to give it another try, I threw up on my way out to the car. After that, will not go back."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from China Express for 8 years.  We have never had a wrong order or bad food.  This place is amazing."}
{"text":"Greasy food. It made me sick. It did not even taste good. Too bad it is the only Chinese place in town."}
{"text":"Apologies in advance for the low stars. If you are looking for quality food... this is not the place. If you are on a budget... definitely the place. Food portions are great for the price. Ordered Almond Chicken, General Tsau Chicken, Chow Mien, Egg Drop soup, Fried rice ($35). Unfortunately the flavor of all items was bad enough for me to not try again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a quick cheap Chinese buffet. Don't set your expectations unrealistically high. The buffet is $9.00 at dinner time. You're likely not going to walk out call and tell all of your friends that you just ate here. But for a quick cheap bite, it beats the same old chain fast food."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem! We usually get takeout just because we're always so busy with work. Their portions are huge & we haven't tried anything that tastes anything less than 4 stars! They're so convenient; we live close by & their prices aren't extremely high like some of the other restaurants close by. We'll keep coming here :)"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from them for the first time.   Showed up faster than promised and food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ordered online, paid with a credit card, delivery showed up in about 45 minutes. I was really hungry so I did call around 30 minutes in just to make sure they actually got my order and that it wasn't lost in space, they had, and all was right with the world.   Vegetable Spring roll = yummy. General Tso's tofu = thumbs up. Lo Mein.... ehhhh I've had better. I ate a little bit and waited just to make sure I didn't die. I didn't, so I'll have the rest for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"This may just be the best General Tso's Chicken I have ever had . Plus the to go  containers work perfectly at keeping your food separated"}
{"text":"There is no shortage of take-out Chinese in the Charlotte area, and most are not memorable in any way.  Truth be known, China Express fits into that category fairly well, because I completely forgot to write this review for quite a while, which would seem to make it lacking in any memorable way as well.  That said, the location is good, but it does suffer from being stuck in a horrible corner of the shopping center, sandwiched between Food Lion and Pizza Spiga, in a small opening that does not even really look like you can make it between the two sections of the parking lot (you can).  If you should happen to be cutting through, or looking for the place, you may want to stop in - because the food is actually decent for this sort of place, and unlike some others, they will not make you wait terribly long for said food.  There is not a lot of space to sit in there and eat, but you probably would not want to do that anyway, right?"}
{"text":"The food here is great. Every single thing that I've ordered so far has been a godsend. I'd die for their orange chicken and vegetable fried rice. Awesome stuff. My family always goes here every month or so for a good dinner."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I'm sorry, but this was terrible. We ordered takeout late last night for delivery. We both ordered Chicken Teriyaki, but you wouldn't know that from what we received. It was mushy, strangely flavored breaded lumps of meat that tasted nothing like teriyaki - and nothing like chicken for that matter. It tasted like breaded fat. It was one of the worst things I've eaten in quite some time. Too bad, we were looking for a decent place open late. It definitely, definitely will not be this one."}
{"text":"I'm never really impressed with Chinese food but I just ordered from here for the 1st time & it's fantastic. Chicken Egg Foo Young - a huge portion, enough for 3 meals for me. Fried chicken dumplings - I love these but don't usually order from others because they always have some phantom weird crunchy parts that freak me out. These don't have those! The dipping sauce is very flavorful & salty (in a good way). Order extra because you'll love it. Chicken fried rice - all the chicken is white meat. The onions in it are bite size so it's not overwhelming. It's not very flavorful on its own but I buy Yum-Yum Sauce from Giant Eagle & smother it with that. Delivery was quick. Definitely only ordering from here from now on. Also - they have free items if you spend a certain amount. I got 3 Crab Rangoon for spending $12+."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write less than great reviews on restaurants since I was in the industry myself for 5 years,but this one is a must. We Walked in, were not greeted... until we stood there a few minutes! Being our first visit, We asked for a description of a certain menu item and were answered with short, basic answers as if we were annoying her. We then asked for chili sauce when our food came out and she rolled her eyes at my husband and said \" I'll bring it to you in a second.\" I was so taken back at the service. Not to mention, there was a dead cockroach right by the table ( that I didn't say anything about because I didn't want to be \" that\" customer) but after the hospitality they give their customers, this needs to be known.   Point is, don't come here because you're not treated as if you are welcomed, more so, as if you're an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Sean fought for ya, China Express.  I was going to go with one star. But the hubby fought for the two. He says 'come on a one is exceptionally awful, that was just bad.' Ok, so two stars.....still no good.   Sean got General Tso chicken and I went with my old standby Kung Pau chicken.  Some things I got to say about this...  1. Um....mystery meat. Close to the nastiest 'meat' ever. Super gristly....there was maybe one piece of chicken that actually resembled edible meat. Gross gross gross.   2. The rice that came with both dishes was bright yellow. Tasted ok, just looked super weird. Not sure why you would serve this rather than your normal steamed white rice.   3. The veggies were good, and the sauce on my Kung Pao was pretty yummy and adequately spicy. But just not enough to offset the nasty meat factor.   4. Egg rolls - overcooked and relatively flavorless.  Oh how I miss my Richie Chan's in Cleveland Heights. The search goes on for go-to Chinese takeout on the west side....."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I've been here twice this week and would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Great general tso's and really good egg foo yung.  Has a vast menu with items most local Chinese places just don't have.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb and fast. Called in a 2 combo plate of sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken and picked it up in 10 minutes. They also have a bunch of slushee drinks to cool you off"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a 4$ lunch special from time to time better than sum mall place and its a family owned business"}
{"text":"I really like this place...reminds me of the Chinese food place inside of Bashas grocery store. So far I have only tried their combo plate with orange chicken and teriyaki chicken. I also tried some of my husbands beef broccoli and sweet and sour pork. Orange chicken was my favorite and I loved the sweet and sour pork. Both were fried crispy and neither were too sweet and food was fresh. Teriyaki chicken was good but they use a sweet teriyaki sauce that I don't care for because I prefer a less sweet more garlic flavor teriyaki sauce but again that is just my preference. I think if I get it again I would ask for no teriyaki sauce. The chow mein was pretty good as well and the fried rice wasn't bad either. I will be returning to this place."}
{"text":"This place used to be good....placed a order for delivery...called back after an hour and they said it was on it's way. Waited another forty five minutes and it was a no show so I got tired of waiting and whipped up something myself...after two hours and fifteen minutes they show up. I told them that throught they wasn't coming so I don't want it. The delivery driver got an attitude and told me thanks for wasting HER time...wow....Weeelll good buy China express and hello king fong...MUCH better food and love my six dollar tips"}
{"text":"I went to this place based on other Yelp reviews.  The restaurant opens at 11AM according to sign posted on the door.  I arrived at 11AM and waited about 10 minutes for the gentleman to open up shop.  I was a little disappointed on that because I was meeting a friend there for lunch.  The service was great!  The lunch deals aren't bad either.  I ordered the orange chicken lunch combo.  It came with an egg roll and crab puff.  I enjoyed the crab puff but I didn't care so much for the egg roll.  I still ate the egg roll anyways.  You can't let food go to waste!  There were a lot of options for boba drinks too!  When you add boba to any place, I'm already a huge fan.  Lastly, the place is in Mesa.  I live in Phoenix.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to go to there.  Mainly because it's Mesa."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time and it is exactly what I read in the reviews. I got the combo and it was delicious also you get what you paid for the plate was full. Will keep coming back as long as the price don't go up and they don't get stingy with serving."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars, but that wasn't an option. We have ordered delivery countless times, mainly because this is the only place that will deliver to our house. Tonight I attempted to order a dinner combo, but asked that the chicken and rice be placed in separate containers. I offered to pay for the extra container. I was refused by 2 different girls, then was told the manager is conveniently not in this evening. I made it clear I wasn't asking for anything free or for more food, just 2 separate containers. I am literally dumbfounded that my request was denied. Will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"From a distance you may overlook this place, dont make that mistake. It is tucked in between Subway and a hair salon.  My family and I have eaten here many, many times, probably 30. I like that I can call and place my order and go pick it up because if you walk in and place your order you may wait five -fifteen minutes. The wait is worth it because they cook everything to order.  Their food is really good and it's not just my opinion, my two (sometimes picky) children ask to eat here.  The staff is a little \"hurry up what you want\" type energy but I suppose it is because they are anticipating more food orders.  If you want a nice sit down restaurant atmosphere, this may not be your place. Yes, there are tables to sit but the ambience is more of a fast food seating set up. In other words great to call ahead and pick your food up great food but if you looking for a place to take clients to sit down with a business meeting probably not this place."}
{"text":"This Chinese food sucks.  The fried rice is lame and so is the Sweet n Sour Chicken.  My wife likes the short ribs they serve, but I think those too, are horrible.  Worst Chinese I've ever had.  It's edible, but when I eat Chinese food, I want decent quality and great taste.  This place serves neither.  They do deliver, I'll give em that.  Oh, and they have printable coupons on their website below...  www.ChinaExpressInParma.com"}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 entree dinner combo, and it did not disappoint! I took it to go, and the employees are extremely personable. It was a nice atmosphere, the prices are affordable, and the portions are large! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"While the food was decent, I would not recommend ordering delivery from here. I ordered food at 8:24, from just 4 miles away from the restaurant, and it took until 9:45 for it to actually be delivered. By then the food was cold and wasn't as good as it should have been.  I gave them directions on the order when I placed it, and they still had to call me 3 times to ask where I was even though I had already told them."}
{"text":"Honestly I've lived in the area a long time and never knew this place was rite down the road . Let me start by saying what an awesome find!!! The Chinese around here isn't very good but this place was amazing! It tasted fresh and crisp very affordable also. I got orange chicken and Mongolian beef super good fresh veggies in the beef ! Crab puffs were also super good to! I highly recommend this place ."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was hesitant to come here at first because of all the reviews, but it's too convenient for me to pass up.   Bottom line, I've been to this place probably about a dozen times and have yet to be disappointed. The food is always hot, veggies are plentiful and well cooked, and the General tso's is delicious. Very cheap, and the staff have always been friendly."}
{"text":"Food was great and reasonably priced. The food has msg though and I paid for it later."}
{"text":"Got really sick eating the shrimp fried rice. Up all night. I Won't be back. I got really sick it was not fun at all.   The service was OK. The place is very basic and simple. One thing I don't like is places that want a tip when you don't have a waiter or waitress."}
{"text":"Always accommodating. My go to for American/Asian fast food. Reasonably priced, made to order and fast. The husband/wife owners do it all, from cooking, ordering, answering phones and washing dishes. Very eager to make sure customers have their food prepared exactly how they prefer. Me? My fave is \"Sautéed Vegetables\". However, I like added ginger, hot chili garlic sauce, tofu, and a topping of stir fried peanuts. Ask and you shall receive! My lunch of a large plate of veggies with tofu, fried rice and a beverage is $6.50. DONE! All served with a smile in under 10 mins of walking through the door! They are closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"This place has good Chinese food.  My go-to order here is the beef chop suey with crispy noodles.  The first time we ordered from this place they threw in a really cool calendar that was rolled up like a scroll and is now hanging the wall in our upstairs office.    I've never had bad food here but after checking out other places I can say it isn't the best.  The last time we ordered here my husband's entree was off-- the meat was hard to chew and the sauce tasted funny."}
{"text":"BOO!!!! DONT ORDER!!! ESPECIALLY THE GENERAL TSOS , I WOULDNT SERVE IT TO MY ENEMY!! how about nasty customer service and messed up order dont even think about ordering here, total bs i order food and wonton soup is soaked into the rest of my fried food wtf!!!LITERALLY IF U PICK UP THE BAG ITSELF THERES A 1.5 INCH OF SOUP ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BAG,   then i complain to call n she told me not to order from her again and hung up, wtf is wrong with ppl, not getting a red cent from me AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese take out place around.  You can't beat the service and food quality, not to mention the proportion sizes!  The lady that owns this place is always there and she is a sweetheart!"}
