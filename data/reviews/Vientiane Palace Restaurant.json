{"text":"If I could eat here everyday, I would. If I was on death row, I would chose the Beef Pad Lao from Vientiane Palace as my last meal. After college, I moved back home for about a year and couldn't stand being 2.5 hours away from my delicious addiction. Luckily, I now live in Madison again and am never more than 10 minutes away from my favorite food. I usually get the Pad Lao with beef (1-2 stars depending on my mood, one star was very spicy even when I started eating there) but I have also had the Pad Thai, Curry Squash (delicious), Noodle with Soy Sauce, and Crispy Noodle. Their egg rolls are the best I have ever had (usually seem to taste better at the Gorham location). Some people write about the poor service in their reviews...my fiance and I have been going there for a few years now and the waitress knows who we and gets very excited when we come in. The staff is very friendly- you just need to get to know them. If you don't like the service, I would still recommend calling your order in and picking it up- the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Bad food. Don't go. The oil was rancid and the soup lukewarm with rubbery bits with the look of onions. That soup's (Tom Yum) only taste was of salty stock blessed with a bit of chili oil--something like a consomm√© of dirty plate. 

We stopped eating after a few bites. The sour oil left a horrendous coating on the tongue. Yuk! 

Overall, imagine a truck stop where last week's food goes to be reheated on its way to having a flu named after it. 

By far, the worst meal I've ever had in Madison."}
{"text":"Yes, the atmosphere is lacking.. but who cares when the food is this good.  
I lived in Madison over 10 years ago and this is still the best Thai food I've ever had.  I dream about all the vegetarian options & the Thai Iced Tea.  Oh, and they are NOT joking with their spices.. if you ask for 5 star, be prepared to feel the pain."}
{"text":"Food is great - try the squash curry.  It's really the best thing on the menu.  Good beer selection.  This is the sort of place where you need to be a little bit assertive to get good service.  Like - if you're sitting there and you need to have your bottle opened GET UP AND GO TO THE COUNTER AND ASK ONE OF THE TWO NICE LADIES WHO RUN THE PLACE FOR A FRICKIN BOTTLE OPENER.  They won't mind. 

 Besides, if you eat at place where you can get more than enough delicious food for two for under 10 bucks and you bitch about not having a damn fine dining experience - well, you're a jerk."}
{"text":"I lived in Madison for 8 years until 2002, and Vientiane Palace was one of my favorite restaurants. I was very happy to see that it was still around one my first trip back to the city in 13 years. Nothing much has changed. It's not a fancy place. In fact, it's kind of dark. But the food is still very tasty - I had the whole fried basil with chicken. I hope it will still be there when I return again."}
{"text":"Decent fare. Spicy level was disappointing."}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai I've had in Wisconsin. Come here now! Of all the choices of places to eat near state street, this is my favorite bar none. I recommend the chicken pad kee mow.  All of the rice dishes are also really good.  The price is reasonable and the taste is spectacular."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pleasant, low key but clean and sunny, with potted plants everywhere. The waitress was very attentive and pleasant. But I regret to say I had to send my curried squash back, it was very over salted and the squash was grossly soft and weird tasting. I asked for a fresh spring roll instead, and was disappointed that it didn't have basil inside, just lettuce, cucumbers and sprouts. My partner got the pho soup and was very happy with it."}
{"text":"The laminated sign on the wall across from the door says \"Please wait to be seated.\"  Soon after you enter, one of the employees will undoubtedly exit the kitchen, stand and stare at you for a moment, then wave you on in the direction of the dining room.  If you don't snatch menus from the counter as you walk by, you may have to wait 20 minutes to get them from the hostess/waitress.

The decor is a cross between my grandma's house, a Chicago cigar lounge and a Southeast Asian travel brochure; eclectic and colorful, yet crumbling, the setting is about as authentic as it gets in Madison.

But the real welcome home parade begins when the food is served.  BEST PAD LAO EVER!  Yes, it is greasy, and yes, it is spicy.  If you're nervous about the spice level, order it zero or one star.  You can always spice it up a bit with the Sriracha sauce on the table.

The only reason I didn't give Vientiane Palace five stars is that their spring rolls could use a little more spring. The two times I've ordered them, the lettuce has been brown on the edges.  But the spicy peanut sauce is kickin'!"}
{"text":"Absolute hole in the wall serving extremely delicious Laotian-Thai food! 

Scary interior, dirty water glasses, poor service, but food to die for! 
Try their eggplant and squash curries. 

BTW, the food is pretty spicy, so watch out."}
{"text":"Decent, cheap thai food. It is greasy, saucy, and uses chilli sauce instead of chilli paste or dried chilli. The restaurant is rather empty most of the time so service is fast."}
{"text":"Much like the other posters have asserted, the service here is atrocious. The owner truly does seem like you are bothering her by entering the restaurant. That has no bearing on my rating though, as I am purely reviewing the food/value. 

I was very disappointed in the entrees and the prices. $10+ for bland pad thai and curries? Really? Add three or four shrimp for $2 more. What a deal. 

The spice level was typical of Americanized asian restaurants. I was expecting more authentic heat based on previous reviewers but 4 stars was very mediocre. So if you like spicy, either go elsewhere or request additional heat to the four stars. 

Pad thai noodles were mainly starch. Little meat or vegetables. Pad lao was akin to the pad thai-- and the squash/coconut curries lacked flavor and protein. I should have expected such based on previous reviews, but I had to try it for myself. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is -- without any overstatement whatsoever -- the worst restaurant I've ever experienced. I went once for lunch with a friend, and neither of us will ever go there again. 

Both entrees at our table were very close to inedible. My entree, which was to be mild, was extremely spicy. (Amusingly, I heard a woman on the other side of the restaurant say, \"I asked for mild, and I can't even eat this!\")

Beyond the spiciness, the food was ill-cooked and unpleasant. Even the rice was poorly cooked, with large chunks of overcooked rice mixed in. 

And the service was appalling! We attempted to be pleasant to the one person working, but she said not a word to us, just blankly waited for our order. She served our food by dropping the plates from rather far above the table, then immediately turning away and leaving.

I've met many people who enjoy this restaurant, and based on that and the other reviews here, I would judge that our experience was not the norm. However, it was so very bad that I will never chance going there again."}
{"text":"This was prolly the worst I have tasted. The fresh spring rolls??? They had old lettuce and no cucumber (even though that was an ingredient listed on the menu). I had the pad Thai.... no bueno! It had stuff NOT listed on the menu.  It did not even look like I food I have ever seen. My daughter said it may be the more authentic version, although hers was slightly burnt... smh! I guess kimchi was added in with it? Not a fan and I disagree with it being authentic. I believe this lady was doing the hosting cooking and cashiering and the restaurant did not have all the ingredients they needed. My girlfriend had the pho and the beef was over cooked and it had chicken liver in it??? The bowl was like a soup or cereal bowl (smaller than a soup bowl.  The sticky rice was ice cold and I just could not even eat anything besides the flavorless shrimp spring roll and two crab Rangoon that was over fried and had less than a teaspoon of filling.   My daughter and girlfriend tried to stay positive and ate more than I did but on the way home, they both had stomach issues and one after the other were locked in the restroom as soon as we returned home.
The only reason I gave this place a star is because of the one woman who was working and doing everything.
Sorry two thumbs way down."}
{"text":"I always order for delivery from this place on a cold winter night when I'm swamped with assignments and too cold to step out.  Their spicy noodles is a very good \"hot mug of milk\" before bedtime."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever tasted in the US! Nuff said"}
{"text":"I love this place, they will actually make it spicy for you!"}
{"text":"Best Thai/Lao  in Madison, hands down. Curried Squash is outstanding.  Slow service at times, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best fried rice I have ever had. It actually has a flavor. My favorite is the Vientienne Fried Rice with shrimp. Other favorites are Singapore noodles with chicken and the curried squash. Major Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my to-go place whenever I'm craving for spicy Asian food. It was recommended to me by my friend who swears by their pho and their fried rice. I've only had their pho but true enough, it was amazing. Super comforting especially during the cold season. It is now my must order whenever I go; it's nothing like the Vietnamese pho I'm used to but equally good if not more special with their Thai and Laotian style added into it. It actually reminds me of Indonesian meatball noodles (bakso). My friends can't stop raving about the curries there and the stuffed tofu is a great appetiser as well. The restaurant owner actually recommended to me the drunken noodles so I'll be sure to try that the next time I visit, which hopefully will be very soon!"}
{"text":"We ate here recently and really enjoyed it. Admittedly it's not my favorite in Madison but it's an excellent,  authentic downtown option with generous portions and good prices and lovely staff. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Vientiane is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in Madison.  Yes, the service is often gruff, and the ambiance leaves something to be desired.  But the Pad Thai, the boringly-named-but-oh-so-delicious Noodles with Soy Sauce, the Lao Noodle Kee Mao, and the Squash Curry all hit the spot every time.  It's comfort food for those who like spicy asian fare, and cheap too!"}
{"text":"Good prices for a large dish size. I got the lao noodle kee mow with tofu and it was delicious. I like spice but I'm not super tolerant of it and medium spiciness was perfect for me."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this restaurant when I lived two blocks away, and while it is pretty ok with a lot of dishes (the drunken noodles, the tom yum), I've had terrible experiences here as well. 

First, multiple times I've picked up an order of squash curry to go and the eggplant was not cooked. I'm talking it was basically raw and chewy. I had to pick them out, which is not what I expect from any restaurant.

Second, they need to reevaluate their customer service. I am from a city where people aren't nice to each other and even I found the demeanor and treatment by the woman behind the counter unnecessarily snappy. 

Now that i live closer to other south east Asian food places I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This was always my favorite restaurant when I lived in Madison and I always make a big effort to visit whenever I'm back in town. Their curry squash is simply the most delicious Thai food I've had, better than anything I've found in the San Francisco Bay Area. I also like the Pad Lao. For the most delicious Thai food ever, the $9 per entree price is very reasonable. 

One characteristic of Vientiane used to be that the service was very matter-of-fact and low-key. They would just hand you menus and let you pick a table, take your order and bring the food, and not make conversation or smile much. Personally I liked it this way; going to Vientiane was all about the food. When I went last week the waitress was more overtly friendly, but I would still say Vientiane is best for people who want to focus on the food, not the service. 

For spice levels, start small. As someone with medium spice tolerance, one star is plenty. For those with low tolerance, ask for zero stars."}
{"text":"Don't bother with this place. This is greasy diner food that can barely be classified as thai. If you are Asian or know what the real thing tastes like, go someplace else. I asked for three stars and the food had no spice. Got a vegetarian dish with tofu, but I had to poke around in the sauce to find any tofu. The waitress or owner who served us had an attitude. Maybe because I had a service dog with me? She exuded unfriendliness, barely spoke to us, put our food on the table and pretty much ignored us after that, except to bring the check when we got tired of waiting for her to appear with it and got up to leave."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is so friendly and food is good! Price was as expected. Seating is cramped but we got our food to go. Cool decor in here! Some are actual imports so it's pretty cool. Nice family oriented environment. Didn't check out the restrooms but like I said, our order was to-go. Convenient location if you're walking downtown. Parking lot is cramped and there's always some traffic downtown. I'll definitely be back for the laap!!!"}
{"text":"I'm with Sarah K. With food this good I don't give a rat's ass about service. You get a pile of excellent food at a great price. 

It's been so long that I can't remember specifc dishes. I just know that everything I tried was always awesome.

However, a friend had an experience similar to Rick's. Poor bastard made a bad choice: Extra super spicy, FRIED fat noodles. He suffered mightily for about 2 days. Spicy coming and going, ouch."}
{"text":"I have a pretty high spice tolerance, and even then I was crying while eating the pho, which I asked for medium spice. It was decent, but the beef wasn't the best."}
{"text":"This place is consistently mediocre in my opinion. The food is overpriced and too greasy."}
{"text":"Great beer selection - you help yourself and wait patiently for a server to bring you a bottle opener.  The vegetable curry is made up primarily of onions and curry sauce made without coconut milk.  The vegetable lo mein (there is another name for it, but that's what it was) was so salty I could somehow taste the MSG.  The waitress was nice enough, but I won't be back.  Ever."}
{"text":"Best for takeout... Service has never been stellar for sure but I am in LOVE with their Vientiane Fried Rice w/Tofu... IMHO the best fried rice in town. Great hangover medicine... large portions and they aren't kidding about their spiciness yowza!"}
{"text":"Tasted OK but wasn't worth the diarrhea that came about 30 minutes later.  Had to visit Fair Trade Coffee around the corner for a bagel to soak up whatever grease was in the Pad Lao.  Ugh."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 20 years. There was a time when I ate here every day. It's not as good as it was but it's still one of my faves. I like the curry squash and the vietienne fried rice."}
{"text":"Two stars (even though I couldn't be stranded too far from a bathroom for a couple of days after eating here) for the lack of decent thai restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"29a with tofu, three stars has been my order for roughly twenty years. It will continue to be so until either hell freezes over or the ladies working there crack a smile. Although the service is atrocious, the five star review is no mistake. The food is that amazing."}
{"text":"Have I been to the same place as the people who gave poor reviews?  I have been here about 5 times recently and every time the woman who seats me is friendly, and takes good care of me when I am there.  The pho here is the best in Madison, BY FAR.  The broth is extremely flavorful and they don't skimp on spice!  The inside decor is way dated and dark, but who cares if the food is good?"}
{"text":"always hits the spot
and it is totally worth 
the diarrhea"}
{"text":"I've been to Vientiane Palace a couple of times. Lao, Thai, and Vietnamese food are my absolute favorite cuisines. Vientiane Palace is near my home. So I want to love this place. But I don't. The food itself is fine, not the best, but still tasty. The decor is drab but I can overlook that. My issue is the hostess/waitress is so surly. We all have bad days, but she always seems very unhappy that we are there. I've seen her smile and chat w/little children so I know she can be friendly, but we definitely seem to be a burden.

On our last visit, when she begrudgingly took our order, I ordered an Iced Tea and a soup, my brother got the pad thai. The soup was good, just the spice level I ordered, my brother found the pad thai very bland and didn't eat much of it. She brought me a Thai Iced Tea rather than an Iced Tea which was fine since I like them both. Normally I might have said something, but she just seemed so annoyed that we were there, I didn't want to bother her.

I'll probably go back because I love that type of food and the location is ideal, but I am keeping my expectations very low."}
{"text":"Disgusting Pad-thai (not that it is spicy, it is SALTY) & not-so-friendly service. I will never come back."}
{"text":"The food taste is really bad and not fresh. I ordered Tom Yum soup today, and it tastes horrible compared to Ho Long Bay. The sea food stir fry is pretty much fill up with vegetables, most of them are onions and green peppers with only a couple of piece of sea food. Mostly surprisingly, there are even a couple of pieces of flat rotten noodles messed up with stir fry and it is gross! I don't even know where the hell they are coming from. Wondering if they actually wash the pan after cooking. I don't see the value matching the price at all. Honestly, even Journey is so so much better than the food quality here. I will not come back again."}
{"text":"The BEST Pad Thai ever! For a while my wife was living in Austin, and I used to do take-out and fly with it to Austin.

Ignore all the comments about the ambience and waitress etc. The food rocks."}
{"text":"First of all, Lao food is not exactly common around places that aren't in Laos.  And yes, it's very similar to Thai food, but there are subtle differences, and Vientiane Palace does Lao food very, very well.

At Vientiane Palace, I was famous for being the White Chick Who Ordered Thai Spicy Food.  This is, apparently, a rarity in brat-and-beer-eating Madison, and the whole staff at this place got really psyched when I came in.  I never had a problem with the service here; everyone was always extremely nice and accommodating when I brought large parties in (which I did now and then).  

But the bottom line is this:  excellent food, and lots of it, for an excellent price.  One of the places I miss most in Madison."}
{"text":"Life long resident of Madison, and Vientiane is hands down the best Thai you'll find in town. Their curry squash dish is absolutely amazing and their pad thai cannot be beat. I'm a meat eater, but their tofu and the way they prepare it is a must try!

There are 3 restaurants in town, but the one on Park St., while superior in atmosphere, lacks in recipe for some reason. The Gorham and Regent locations are amazing. Don't expect much for service from the Gorham location, but rather the best Thai you'll find in Madison."}
{"text":"Mediocre Lao food. I thought it was kinda odd when the hostess/waitress handed us the menus and told us to seat ourselves. Other than that she was very nice. We ordered sticky rice, paradise beef, pad Lao, BBQ pork, and chicken wings. The only thing worth raving about was the padlao. Noodles were a little firm for my liking but flavor was on point. I told her just a little spicy and it was just that. Everything else is not even worth mentioning. Sticky rice was brought out cold. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"BEST Lao-Thai food I have ever had!

Vientiane Palace looks like a seedy place from the outside, and inside is pretty divey, but that is what keeps this restaurant a good secret! 

I have never seen the restaurant full, so food comes extremely timely, and is great for take out.

Yes, the food is pretty greasy. AND you always have to remind first timers that what they consider \"mild\" is another restaurant's \"extra hot\" - but people who love spice will find themselves challenged here for sure.

I have never been to another Asian restaurant where the fried rice is to die for, so flavorful. Another favorite is the Singapore noodles, so yummy.

The service is fine because it is never very busy, however unless you are a regular, don't expect anyone to be too friendly. But who cares, its the food you are there for."}
{"text":"After trusting many other reviews I was sourly disappointed.  
I am into checking out dives because that's where the best food is at.  But this place was dive-y just to be dive-y and the food was nothing special.  I also went on others suggestions of getting the fried rice.  But it was not the best fried rice I've ever had.  I'm pretty easy to please in regards to food, except when I've made better in my own kitchen and I am not a cook.   

major booooooooo"}
{"text":"Good for me 3 or 4 stars
Husband rates this 4 or 5 stars
Averaging 4 Stars

We ordered a couple curry dishes, rice, and spring rolls
We requested that everything be medium hot and asked for a side container of their hot chili sauce.  Which the lady said,  :Oh yes, that's a good idea.\"

We also ordered the iced coffee...FABULOUS!!"}
{"text":"When I was a college type in Madison, I ate here every_day. I'm not lying. At the very least I would get the Thai fried rice. It was an expensive but fulfilling activity. 

The Singapore noodles and curry squash are second to none and I have eaten at many a Thai restaurant.  We have made the drive just for the food several times."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's been 6 years since I lived in Madison and I still make the drive from Milwaukee just to eat here. 

Go for the Bean-Thread Noodle and the Lao Noodle Kee Mow.  I used to do the 3 in degrees of hotness but I go for the 2 now. I  still pay for it the next day ...but it's freaking worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is not fancy, but that is one of the reasons I love it. No frills, but AWESOME food!  Prices are really reasonable and their portions are HUGE. I usually have enough for dinner and also for lunch the next day. Their pad thai is the best I have ever had! If you don't try it you are missing out !"}
{"text":"Really good thai-ish food with a twist, which I can appreciate. It's a nice change of pace from regular day to day thai. They also have a really impressive asian beer selection.

The restaurant interior and the service is pretty crappy, but the low low prices make up for it.

Give it a try, but watch out for all the students."}
{"text":"Well, if you ignore the meager decor and shitty shitty service, this place rocks!! Lots of food with a great curry sauce.  Last time I ate here with my mom, the lady heling us didn't speak a single word and glared at us the entire time.  The food is too good to pass up though...and the two of us ate there for about $18.....3 stars."}
{"text":"Reviews for this place were really mixed so I thought I'd take a chance. Don't think I'll be back.

Vientiane Palace bills itself as \"Lao-Thai food\" so the menu is different from your standard Thai restaurant, which makes it interesting. If you go here for a greasy gut-bomb guilty pleasure, you might be happy. But I like my vegetables fresh and well seasoned, not drowning in oil. (Seriously, I think I might have heard them crying out for help.)

I asked to get my food spicy (3 out of 4 stars on their scale) and it was decently spicy but I bet I could have withstood the \"extra hot\" ... If you like heat, go for the 4 stars. On the other hand, you could also do this at home: I tend to suspect that the reviewer was right who claimed this restaurant achieves its spice level by adding more siriracha sauce.

Portions also weren't great for the price. $22 for two entrees. Our \"half chili duck\" was actually delicious... Greasy but well flavored... However, the container was at least half bones. Our other dish, curry squash with chicken, had hardly any chicken.

Onward in my quest for excellent Thai food in Madison."}
{"text":"The service isn't as bad as most people seem to think. No, it isn't the overly nice service you get so many places these days, and the staff isn't going to hold your hand. But there's a big difference between the service at Vientiane, and if you have a bad/mean/angry/whatever waitress at Denny's. Vientiane is business-like, but they've always been nice to me. Maybe if you don't go in there and get huffy about the service, they're nicer?

Either way, Vientiane is one of my favorite restaurants. It's so delicious, and I always have food for another meal leftover, and there are so many choices, even for a vegetarian. The Pad Lao is my favorite, I could get it every day."}
{"text":"I've been there for lunch and dinner. Coming from Asia and California, I feel that it's typical Americanized salty Asian cuisine. It's still taste good though. It's just very oily and high in sodium. If you're looking for HOT food, this is one of the few places in town where you can get it.

The menu list the spice level up to 4 star. There is a 5 star level if you ask for it. Some friends of mine who snack on raw jalapeno peppers \"cried\" when they ate their meal. I had a 4 star and 3 star today; either I'd increased my tolerance or they'd toned down the spices.

The service is very lay-back. And the lady was considerate enough to leave a pitcher at the table. The restaurant was half-full both during lunch and dinner time and not noisy. If you like to hold conversations over meals, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.

So disclaimer: I just recently got into Thai food. I'm certainly no expert. But the curry here is really runny. The rice I got with my order was not impressive ... and that's rice. I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Updated to a 3 because half the time it's a hit and half time it's a miss. Still best pad that and curry squash in town so deserving of a 3."}
{"text":"Long ago, I sold my soul to Vientiane Palace.  I flipping LOVE IT.

You get a ton of food for meager prices.  I've always gotten what I've asked for in terms of spiciness (2 stars is adequate to get my nose running), and I've never had anything that was less than stellar in terms of taste.  They have an incredible selection of beers, too.  Try the Lao beer--it's perfect for quenching the spicy food.

The service is hilariously awful most of the time.  Have you ever seen the \"Abe Vigoda's Restaurant\" sketch on Conan?  One of the owners acts like that--stone faced, speechless and she all but dumps the food on the table.  You shouldn't take it personally; just shrug it off.  The food is too good to get all pissy about the service."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty terrible.  The decor is awful and feels very much like a hole in the wall place.  This would be fine if the place actually was a hole in the wall.  Instead, the space is quite large though feels crowded with too many empty tables.  Takeout is the way to go for this restaurant.  

The food is quite tasty though I feel like the level of spiciness is mostly determined by the amount of sriracha they add to the dish.  The dishes here are reasonably priced.  I ordered some wide sauteed noodle dish with tomatoes, basil, pork, and bean sprouts.  The dish was super flavorful and I ate it with plain white rice as a complement."}
{"text":"The fried whole basil is great. If you like spicy food, ask to get it at 3. It had plenty of heat."}
{"text":"Love this place! I get the Singapore noodles with chicken every time. I love that you can pick you spiciness level.

Place looks like an old laundromat from the outside, and is extremely tacky inside, but that just adds to its greatness in this case!

Service is not great either, but the food is too good!

Also always room for groups."}
{"text":"The place smelled weird when we walked in... which totally freaked me out, but my roommate reminded me that I apparently have an \"over-sensitive\" nose. Kk. Anyway, we sat down and enjoyed a dece meal! Good low prices and big enough dishes to get two meals out of. The crab rangoon was notably delicious. The water/cups tasted kinda funky. Maybe I'd do this for take-out next time..."}
{"text":"Vientiane Palace is great as a lunch location (it'd probably be good for dinner as well). Portions are fairly large. The spiciness is something you can ask to specify with many dishes. While I've one one or two occasions had something that turned out more mundane than I expected, usually the food is excellent. I concur with Sarah that the service isn't bad, just \"business-like\", although I confess I've never eaten here with a guest, just by myself. Which doesn't mean anything, since the food's good enough that I'd recommend to anyone who generally likes Southeast Asian cuisine and wants to try something new."}
{"text":"Food is good in general but the Pad Lao is one of the best things ever.  The service is not like your typical restaurant.  Partly due to the language barrier, the woman there isn't the friendliest.  Food comes out at an average speed.  As a result I order take-out.  Don't expect friendly service but expect amazing food."}
{"text":"I ordered togo food today. The ice coffee and ice tea are good as expected, but the papaya salad smells horrible and tastes really bad. I ended up throw it away. It is a large size 9.50. I felt that I've wasted my money. I also ordered the shrimp spring rolls. The rice skin of the spring rolls are very sticky and only one piece of shrimp. I've ate spring rolls at Saigon Noodles by west towns mall. They are just not comparable. Not going back for the food again. Maybe ice coffee and tea."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a dive, but in a charming family-run way, and they know what \"vegan\" means (e.g. no fish sauce). The vegetables in my spicy red curry seemed fresh, and the dish was delicious. 

What else? They give you tons of rice. Water tasted a little funny, but I might just be used to Chicago's tapwater. To be safe, get a beer instead."}
{"text":"Can't say I would go back-maybe too authentic for me??  Pork in the spring rolls was not fresh nor tasty, and it was ground pork.  The lettuce in the spring rolls was brown as well. Not a fresh taste. I also ordered a vegetable stir fry with shrimp-medium spice. Nice flavor, nice spice, but this dish was swimming in sauce.  I usually like these types of dishes to have the flavor of the food, accented by any sauce."}
{"text":"I walked in on a whim and ordered some food for carry out. The food was ready very quickly. I got squash curry and tom yum soup, which was spilling all over the plastic bag as the woman handed it to me to go. The food was good, but really really greasy. If I was hungover and craving thai, then I would probably consider this place again. But I think there are much better options for thai in Madison."}
{"text":"Well if you like Thai food and want try something slightly different, then go west to the next country...and try Laotian food. Madison, WI has 2 or 3 Laotian restaurants, which is unusual for a city this size. Vientiane is the capitol of Laos, Madison is the Capitol of Wisconsin, maybe that explains it (or not!). Like Pad Thai? Try Pad Lao! Everything is similar to Thai, but with a slightly different emphasis of flavors and/or ingredients. I would describe it as a little more heavy handed and hearty, not as delicate. This goes for the service, too, which is heavy handed and lacking in gentleness. Hey, if I were used to the weather in Southeast Asia and now adapting to Madison, WI, I would be grumpy, too! If you are a student, this is a great place to get tasty, spicy food and still afford some books."}
{"text":"Just....not great.
The interior looks like it was done in 1980 and not touched since. They haven't even replaced the burned out light bulbs. The waitress said exactly the number of words she was required to say to us and not a single one more.

I ordered \"Curry Dishes,\" described as potatoes, onions, coconut milk, spices. I was expecting it to be just like any other southeast Asian yellow curry dish I've had. The reality was very different - brown sauce with a smoky flavor, it was more like what I expect at a Chinese restaurant. My husband ordered the squash curry, which was also brown, very spicy and nothing like other squash curries I've had. Though I love that the squash was roasted.

Now, I can't pretend to speak to the authenticity of the food, but I can definitely say that these two dishes were nothing like those served in every other Lao/Thai/Vietnamese place in town. While fairly tasty, they were greasy and lacking the complex flavor of spices I expected."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I always get one star spicy- be warned, this is not American spice. It's so good you can't stop eating even as your eyes and nose water out of control. I've never had a bad dish from here but my favorite is the beef pad thai. It's the perfect blend of spicy peanut and cool rice.

Be warned though- the service is... well, grudging. The woman acts as though you were placed on this Earth to be the end of her days. Meanwhile, I've taken many new people there over the years and after warning them about her but saying the food is worth the attitude I've never had anyone disagree!"}
{"text":"It's been so long that I've been to this place, but their food is always good, I always love their fried rice, even when I transferred to Indiana, when I came for a visit, I would grab something to go from here to bring back, yes, it's really good. They used to have 2 places, but this one is the better location ones and it's bigger space. Parking is a hssle cause it's on the street but all in all, I would come back to this place to eat. Also, don't forget, when they ask you how spicy you want, you better know what you're getting yourself into cause their spicyness level is really crazyy..."}
{"text":"I've had kind of a hit-or-miss experience with this place.  I used to work a block away, so would go frequently.  The curried squash is usually pretty great- but super inconsistent.  Nothing I've ever had has been the same twice.  Either the heat of the dish varies, or even the ingredients- depending on who's in the kitchen.  But if you're going to Vientiene, I would definitely stick with this location."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp pad Thai and they gave generous portions of both meat and noodles. The pad Thai was also very flavorful so i didn't need to use any additional chili sauce which is great. 
I also ordered the shrimp spring rolls and they were fresh and on point. 

I will definitely recommend this joint to anyone in the area who wants some delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"Yummo. I just stopped by with my husband. I got the sweet and sour chicken and it was delicious. He got the spicy plate. Both were spicy and fresh. The rice could have been better but boy did the food compensate.

I was a little tad worried about the service from what I have read. I was scared she was going to be angry. She was very pleasant and nice and brought us extra rice. Then two fellows came in and were very demanding of her. They ordered their meals loudly while she was approaching them from the other side of the room. Her demeanor changed, she wasn't rude but she sure didn't seem to enjoy serving them. 
She seems like a kind lady and mirrors the behavior she receives opposed to just biting the bullet."}
{"text":"The best Thai in Madison. The atmosphere is friendly and the food is fresh. I recommend the chicken Pad Ke Mow with an Asahi. The soups are also pretty delicious. Owners are friendly and will serve you a quality meal."}
{"text":"The food is great, and when they say \"hot,\" they genuinely mean it. The maximum star rating made me cry into my food. This has never happened in any other Madison restaurant."}
{"text":"We were walking in the area and decided to pop in for lunch. We have heard from a few different people over the years that this is a great lunch place. I ordered the Singapore noodles with Tofu and he ordered the squash curry with tofu. They offer your choice of mild, medium and/or hot heat in your dish. The restaurant is in an older building, but it was clean inside. There's not a lot of parking in their lot, so you either need to find parking nearby ($) or walk quite a ways to get there. There were 3 other tables occupied. My dish was ok. Not great though. The ramen stye noodles were not done enough and the veggies saved the dish for me. There was a nice variety of veggies to make it work. The tofu was pretty bland and I couldn't really taste it. His curry dish came with white sticky rice. The sauce had a hint of smoke in it. This smoky flavor really pulled the curry out in a big way. Nice sized pieces of squash and eggplant in this dish. I've been to a lot of places in Madison for noodles. This may be farther down the list of places that I would get noodles again. I would return for the curry dish though. The service was quick and we were out of there during a lunch break."}
{"text":"Love this place, spices are on point! Every time I am in Madison this is a MUST stop. My favorite dish is the fried rice with shrimp paste and level of spicy is 3 star spicy. The dish is actually spicy, unlike some places that claims it's spicy and it comes out mild. Their pad Thai is also a favorite. Appears to be a hole in the wall but the food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"What you get here is damn tasty food but I agree that the service here is usually pretty awful.   I frequented here quite a bit a few years ago but was waiting for a return visit to write about my experience. My curry squash was excellent, as most of the vegetarian dishes have been in the past.  However my dining companion got the seafood plate, and it it had a burnt beefy taste and for some reason his dish consisted of 65% onion.    Lunch specials are crazy cheap, dinner is still a good deal, they charge for soda refills.  Stick to the Pad Thai/Lao or the Curries avoid the seafood. (This is Wisconsin, after all.)"}
{"text":"YOU MUST eat the Pad Lao. 

I've tried to recreate it many times over the years, but can't quite get it right. Its the best with pork, but its also very good with tofu. It's a giant plate, and the leftovers are even better. I like to eat them cold. The cold temperature with the hot and sweet of the pad lao is magical. I go whenever I am back in Madison!"}
{"text":"Great Pad Thai. Spice level 1-5, haven't tried 5 just yet. I had chicken and Jennifer had Tofu. The place was an old gas station so there is parking in the front. Inside atmosphere is ok. It's al about the food, though."}
{"text":"I always like coming here for lunch or dinner. They aren't too crowded as they do a lot of take out and delivery.  They have a wide range of dishes from curry to noodle dishes and specialty Vietnamese dishes. I always have leftovers and the food is very good. And they don't mess around with their spice levels so eaters beware. The service is also quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I was brought to this restaurant by a friend who lives in Madison, and this was my first time eating this type of food, so I was excited.  When we went in we were handed menus and were able to pick our own table since there were only two only tables at the time.  It is a quiet and easy going kind of place.  Our server, who I also think is the owner, brought us water and gave us a few minutes to order.  We ordered vegetarian Spring rolls for an appetizer and we both ordered the Pad Thai with two stars (for spiciness).  The Spring rolls were okay, they were not what I had pictured in my mind.  These rolls were bean sprouts with cabbage and lettuce wrapped up in rice paper served with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce.  The Pad Thai came out soon after and it was a very large portion!  We also split a bowl of white rice.  Never having had Pad Thai before I really liked it!  Two stars were plenty hot enough for me as well.  
Overall, I ate good food and enjoyed looking around the place.  I might go here again if someone had their heart set on it, but I am probably going to try a few other places in town before I come back to this one."}
{"text":"I enjoy dining out for good food as much as for good service--I no longer expect good service here and will only do carry out.  

After several visits over the last year I now know that it's standard for the owner/hostess to be exasperated and aloof, perhaps even unhappy to see humans on the premises. 

The flavors are good, which I do appreciate, but the overall ingredient quality is meh--I especially don't like the chicken, which is minced, chewy and not very prevalent in dishes."}
{"text":"Tried out Vientiane for lunch...many menu options, reasonable prices, and huge portions. They had about five lunch specials that were only $6-7. 

We tried the Pad Thai with tofu, which was pretty good. We also had the daily curry special with tofu, which was very tasty. The spring rolls were ok...nothing to write home about.

Service is definitely not their strong point. Don't expect a cheery greeting when you walk in. After waiting for the check for about 10 minutes, we finally realized that your bill is waiting for you at the counter, where you pay and ask for take-out boxes. Overall, decent thai food."}
{"text":"Holy greasy thai food Batman.  I get this stuff every time I'm in the area.

I pregamed with their pad thai when I went to Freak Fest this past year.  We got take out, and food took longer than expected.  They seemed to be running out of supplies, but again Freak Fest was going on and Lady Gaga was sharing a drunken noodle with Kate Gosselin, Lady and the Tramp style.  My cousin, a Madison native, said she had never seen the place so busy.

It was delicious regardless of the festivities and the left overs were divine.

See you next time."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town, get it to go unless u don't mind the somewhat dirty restaurant.  Been eating there for 15 years"}
{"text":"I generally try not to write negative reviews based on one visit to a restaurant.  After visiting Vientiane Palace, however, I feel compelled to warn others of a potentially very bad meal.  

My husband had gone to Vientiane Palace a few times and enjoyed the food he had on his previous visits, so I was really excited to try it out.  We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday night to an empty restaurant.  This was a bit odd, but not anything that we would normally worry about.  The decor is minimal, but the orchids and plants placed in the windows are healthy and well maintained, which I felt was a good sign.  We ordered hot tea and fresh spring rolls to start out with.  We also ordered meals, but since we never got to them, I will not comment on them in this post.  

The tea arrived at the table ice cold (in a mug).  We pointed this out the waitresses and they brought hot tea a couple minutes later.  The wait staff were friendly and fairly attentive.  When the fresh rolls arrived, I was excited.  I LOVE fresh rolls and had always had good experiences with them at other restaurants.  When I bit into the Fresh Spring Rolls, however, I was greeted by the distinct taste and texture of rotting bean sprouts.  Upon examining each roll, they were both filled with grey/brown bean sprouts and a few noodles.  No tofu or basil, just the sprouts and noodles.  2 things really freaked me out about this situation.  1.  Sprout are prone to bacteria and salmonella, which makes it important to keep bean sprouts fresh and well washed when storing and serving them.  2. Fresh rolls need to be freshly wrapped just prior to serving, because the wrapping will generally fall apart after a few hours, which means the cook knowingly served us rotting food.  We left as quickly and politely as we could.  

What concerns me about this place is that it seems that most people order cooked/fried food, which does cover up the flavor and look of older ingredients.  I get the need to use up ingredients to save on money and food waste, but this place seems to have no qualms with serving outright rotting produce.   Given the quality of the food we had, I would not recommend eating there again."}
{"text":"This is a family owned, small, casual dining establishment. Nothing fancy, and that's just fine. It's not Thai, to be clear it's Laotian. I've been eating here for years, many, many years and have eaten most items on the menu. The pad Thai is made w/ a noticeable sauce, the curries are thinner than the coconut milk varieties found in Thai restaurants and the flavors here are quite spicy. If you prefer milder heat just ask. They have a sweeter, browner version of the pad Thai that is out of sight! The owners will likely be 1) cooking and 2) taking your order most days out of the week. I enjoy the food here and have eaten at almost all of the Thai-like cuisine in town. Don't be turned away by the curt staff or the dingy walls. Consider it added ambiance, I don't think you'll be sorry."}
{"text":"If you're a student with no way to get to Lao Lan Xaag, this place will do.  However, the place looks run-down and the service would best be called 'casual'.

Food was good though.  It's just that it can be so much better."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time when I was a student at UW-Madison. Food was awesome and in huge portions. I recently revisited this place when I was in Madtown again and I am sad to feel the need to downgrade my experience...

Environment wise, it's the same old - dark, not very clean and kinda smelly (mainly the mixture of foods). Service was also just like usual: because it's family owned and run, the kids help out a lot and therefore you may not get your water filled as frequently (or get your own water jug fast enough).

The appetizer fried tofu we had was a let-down. While four wedges for $2 wasn't bad, the tofu was particular sour and the oil that it was fried in was obviously \"old\" oil that was being used over and over again. Maybe the stuffed fried tofu would have been better, i don't know.

We had pad thai and the spicy plate. I feel like the pad thai was merely a smash of noodles, very little to none meat and bean sprout, and lots of sriracha sauce and potentially ketchup. It was also too moist to my tastes and for some reason they didn't have peanuts in it any more, taking away a layer of texture and flavors. The spicy plate was better on the other hand, although the medium to hot spicy level was not spicy enough. There were a lot of onions and not enough of other ingredients that made me want the dish such as Lao zucchini. There were lots of flavors in that dish including the coconut sauce but the different flavors were not blended very well so some abruptly overpowered the others at one bite or another... 

Overall I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves Thai/Viet/Lao food in Madison. You can't beat the price and location (right off of State St) and there are a lot of dishes you can explore around in this dive-y restaurant. I hope they can keep up with the food quality because it's rare that they haven't been raising prices and downsizing food portions."}
{"text":"The lady who took our order was nice and accommodating.  She greeted us kindly and pulled tables together to accommodate our party.  

We ordered pho, but I believe they call it rice stick soup,  it tasted good but not great enough to warrant another return visit.  The portion was small and not adequate.  We also ordered pad Lao and it was a unique taste but probably not cooked long enough as the noodles were still hard.  The other noodle dish seems to just taste like plain noodles and pepper.

If you like your food with a little kick, be sure to order it on a \"medium\" level.  WARNING: if you're used to eating food extra extra spicy, then order it on a \"hot\" level.  I'm afraid to find out what their \"extra hot\" level is.

Overall, I give the food and service a 4 out of 5 star.  If you're an avid fan of Asian cuisine I would say this us a safe bet to eat.  If you're looking for a restaurant that has a signature dish, I don't think this is the place to find one."}
