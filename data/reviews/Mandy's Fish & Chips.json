{"text":"Just ate here for the first time today and it was awesome!!  Had the Catfish Sandwich and the best I have had since Chicago.. You need to eat here!!"}
{"text":"I had the fish and shrimp combo and it was delicious.  I got more fish than I expected!  I am very happy that they opened a location out in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Ed's is better than Pete's but Mandy's is better than them all. The catfish is on point and get it every time. Wife loves the cod and the Philly. The selection of the menu has something for everyone anf the portions will leave you satisfied and probably leftovers."}
{"text":"Extremely fast delivery , good food for your money . Can't really go wrong. Best chicken nuggets I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some catfish, so I decided to try the 12 East Cafe on Jefferson.  Unfortunately, they apparently close at 3:00pm.  There I was, right between Mrs. White's to the West and Mandy's Fish and Chips to the East.  I hopped on the train and got off at  the next stop east, and sure enough, there was Mandy's, \"right there.\"    The building looked like a second hand fast food joint.  The parking lot was completely empty, and the door facing the metro rail was locked.  the drive-thru sign was on, but the open sign was off.  I decided to try another door, and it was unlocked.  It turns out that they had just forgotten to turn the sign on!  The inside was Spartan, but clean. At the counter, I ordered the fish and chicken combo plate with a soda, and I asked to substitute hush-puppies for the fries.  The total came to $12.00 even.  The food was brought to me in about 4-5 min.   The fish was pretty good, moist inside with a really nice, light corn batter. The chicken strips however, were on the dry side, but that's why God made spicey dipping sauce.  The hush-puppies, on the other hand, were beyond saving.  These dense, little, under cooked, bland lumps were truly the worst push-puppies I have ever eaten.  This may sound like a joke, but Long John Silver's hush-puppies are way better.    Overall,  It's a Nice, little fish and chips place.  If I try it again I'll get fries or onion rings if they have them.  The locked door I encountered when I first approached the building was actually being looked at by a lock smith as I was leaving, so that at least has been fixed."}
{"text":"Mandys fish and chips is the best fish in town! All their fish is fresh and cut daily. They have cod, catfish, bass, whiting and tilapia. They also have two different batters of your choice of English or cornmeal. Everything is cooked as soon as you put in your order so it's nice, hot and fresh. They have more than just fish such as burgers, wings, gyros, chicken sandwich, etc. I ordered the Todays Special that comes with 3 pieces of fish, 3 shrimp & 3 hush puppies with fries for 9.49 plus tax. You can also mix your fish so I decided to try catfish, whiting, and tilapia. Everything was just amazing! I'll be back for sure and will be spreading the good news about Mandys!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my daughter.  She was right, Great food, great service,  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is fire!!!  big satisfying portions, I'll definitely be back. Great family business with excellent customer service. The owner would frequently check on how we were doing. I've had almost everything on the menu and have not yet been disappointed. Fish and chips are literally the best in town, hands down. Make your way over there I promise you won't be let down!!!"}
{"text":"Wing sauce is legit.. It's not THAT hot but absolutely has kick to it.. I ordered through eat24 and everything went smoothly.. I arrived a few mins before my food was ready and I talked to the gentle me running the place... Dude is very nice and gives great customer service..."}
{"text":"Very basic fish & chips. The cod was good and the fried clams were tasty, but nothing was house made and the fries were generic frozen and not very good (inedible unless you were starving or incredibly stoned, and I'm talking Cheech & Chong stoned!).   We stopped because we're always looking for a hidden gem, but this wasn't it."}
{"text":"Fantastic, the Philly cheese steak sandwich reminded me of days long gone! The only problem we had was our hush puppies were burnt.  :(   The rest of the order was great. Will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"I grew up eating fish in Seattle, where most seafood chains don't survive.  I'm an admitted seafood snob, and I've been suffering fish withdrawal ever since I moved to Phoenix.  That said, Mandy's is GOOD fried fish.  I had cornmeal breaded cod, hush puppies and cole slaw.  The fish and pups were served right from the fryer, piping hot and perfectly done.  Breading on the fish was thin and crisp, just as it should be, and the fish was flaky and flavorful.  The hush puppies were crispy outside, had no hint of mushiness inside, and were delicious.  Mandy's tartar sauce appears to be homemade and is excellent.  One star off for the cole slaw, which was fresh and not soupy, but lacked flavor.  Finally, good fish in Phoenix!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just discovered this little place. Had the Mandys special with a side of clams. Good and filling. Look forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"I've found a new home for my fish cravings !!! We were in the mood for fish and decided to try  Mandy's Fish & Chips in Avondale and we are fully satisfied in our decision.   We had a sampling of practically half the menu and we were WOWED with every single bite ! We had cod, catfish, whiting, and bass for our fish selections and we had fried zucchini, fried mushrooms, fried clam strips for our appetizers. Every single item was cooked to perfection and served in quick and courteous manner.   We can't wait to return and feast on these tasty tidbits of the sea."}
{"text":"I discovered that I love thicker pieces of fish with a selection of cod. I only eat cod & salmon fish species. This place doesn't over bread batter the pieces of fish. And the fish pieces of cod have all been long pieces 7-9in. The well made tartar sauce is just right and not overwhelmingly pickly.   Staff are well mannered, down to earth, and calming. I don't enjoy boisterous superficialities or egotistical crowds, so it works out just right compared with the competing personalities of some other establishments."}
{"text":"Didn't try the fish but the burgers were avg at best. Store bought buns, looked like frozen patties. Had clam strips they were mostly crumbs and tasted frozen as well. Hopefully their fish is better as it's in their name"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place I have found in Pheonix for true fish n chips.  Delicious fresh cod!  I 've been to Pete's.....I was not impressed and haven t been back"}
{"text":"The best fish and chips in town! Everything is fresh. Not too far from ASU downtown and it's definitely worth taking the light rail too!! I'll always be back for sure"}
{"text":"This is my experience here at Mandy's. Cod had gone bad. This should never happen. Bad food management. Catfish was not very tasty. Fries had no flavor The shrimp was typical frozen butterfly. Cocktail  sauce was to spicy and taste like tomato sauce.  Tartar sauce was ok , standard fare. After discovering the rotten cod we threw  everything in the trash. ( 40.00 dollars ) I got it to go on 7/28/16 ."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I wanted to try somewhere new, so we thought we'd give Mandy's a try. We got burgers, fish sandwich, fries, and calamari rings between the 3 of us.  I was shocked this place gets such high reviews. Granted a lot of the food we got wasn't the fish items, but still. Soggy fries, dry fish, cheap nasty burgers, even the calamari was cheap tasting.  I can be pretty forgiving with an inexpensive burger place, but it was really lacking any effort."}
{"text":"Never again... start with sauces: tartar bitter and vinegars  bad, , cocktail tasted like ketchup  with vinnrgar. , bad.  Ranch not homemade. But ok.  Codfish was excellent. Best in english batter,,,,,,shrimp left whole breading ok but overcooked, batter choclate in color and shrimp hard and dry,, overcooked. Zuchi n i ,,,too much breading, ,,mushrooms small not fresh then batte5ed,,store bought?, fries,,ok. Expected more for $60.00 + Knockknead lobster at keast fresh not overcooked. For my family and extended family, we will stay with Petes on 44 st."}
{"text":"Had delivery which took an hour and a half and the catfish and cod were bland and didn't give us the option to choose English breading. However the filets were perfectly sized. Fries were soggy. They gave us a slice of cheese cake for free and it wasn't very good either but at least they acknowledged their lateness."}
{"text":"This was my first but definitely not last visit to Mandy's. I ordered a family meal and hush puppies. The food was heavenly, savory, and satisfying. The portions are generous. The best thing for busy people is they have a drive thru. I called in the order, 10 mins later picked it up at the drive thru, family fed, mission accomplished! The fish was meaty and didn't have that \"fishy taste\". I was impressed because I ordered the catfish and I'm very picky about how good fish taste. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the fish is (I write this as I am eating). The wonderful lady who took my order had outstanding customer service. The piece de resistance is they carry Thrifty Ice Cream. All around it was an excellent experience! Right now it tops my list for the best fried fish in Phoenix. I highly recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"The food was great , definitely  will be coming back. Our group had the fish, gyro, burger & wings."}
{"text":"Coworkers suggested Mandy's, so I swung by for some dinner.  Ordered a special of 3 pieces of cod & 3 shrimp with fries & a drink. Asked for the 1 cod with English breading, the other 2 with cornmeal. Got the reverse.  The shrimp were fine. Nothing special.  The cornmeal cod was perfect. Cooked just right & crunchy as expected.  The English style were over-breaded, greasy, flat, small pieces of some non-cod white fish that was so overcooked it was black. Never got a cup for a drink, but I'm not a soda drinker to begin, so no major loss. Yet still feel jipped.  The fries were limp & flavorless.  Not impressed at all. Either my coworkers have crappy taste or the cook at dinner time had a very off night.  Considering there was one other person in there, it's not like they were rushed & should've messed up the order to this level of epic bad.  Made me wish Jack in the Box would bring back their fish & chips n"}
{"text":"The fried okra was awsome the cod sandwich was very large and good. I really enjoy it for lunch and had enough for alitte dinner."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. I had shrimp and fish (cod) and fries. All were really good and I will be back for sure. Tried the potato salad and it was a bit too sweet for me but it was good.  My wife had the catfish and she said she liked my cod better so she'll get that next time.  Prices were good for the food we got. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! There is something for everyone here. We just tried this last week and already went back today. This will be my new go to for fish and chips! The service there is also awesome. Thanks for being the full package guys!"}
{"text":"I had the gyro and it was above average. This place is very deceptive. Once inside you are taken back by how nice it looks. The food is fresh and does take a little time to get to you but it's worth it.   Just needs a little heat. That's the Arizonan in me, I need to sweat a little with my food. I just added Tabasco sauce. Great little restaurant"}
{"text":"I had seen my barber post on Instagram a picture of a plate of fish and fries, so I asked them where did they get it from, and when she told me where... I went straight over! I very pleased with what I ordered. Fish was perfect, and shrimp was good"}
{"text":"This was a amazingly delicious place. We were very satisfied. Food was great!!! Service was great and the fish was delicious and fluffy. THIS is now our place to be."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I drive an extra 20 minutes just to get the food here. And the service is on point. They really take care of you and know how to keep you coming back. There is really nothing on the menu that won't disappoint.  Come here and enjoy. And go blue."}
{"text":"This is the best fish and chips that I've eaten in the Phoenix West Valley. I had the daily special of cod Fish and chips it came with three pieces of cod in three shrimp. I can't say enough good things about how it tastes.      Bobby, the lady who waited on us, Was the friendliest person and help us decide what would be best for us. Five stars all the way"}
{"text":"Great food. Great customer service would recommend everyone to try. I had the catfish and chips with a side of fried zucchini everything was delicious"}
{"text":"Have you ever been riding along and a place catches your eye and for whatever reason you can't stop but vow to return to that place one day? Mandy's was that place for me. Right off the light rail stop at 24th Street, I was continually passing it by on my commute from Mesa to Downtown Phoenix and back again.  When a friend of mine at work had yet to experience the light rail, I knew a perfect opportunity for her to ride it would be an excursion for lunch and Mandy's would be the ideal place for us to go. Believe me, Ms. Mandy did NOT dissapoint. Almost everything there is fresh and homemade.  The fish was tasty and not greasy and the tartar sauce was chunky and creamy. The cocktail sauce was a tad vinegary for my liking, but it had good flavor.  The only thing that I think would take this place to the next level and give it an extra star is some hand cut fresh 'chips' because while cooked well, you can tell they came out of a bag. I'll definitely be returning and bringing friends with me next time!"}
{"text":"Very good. We had the cod, shrimp, hush puppies and fries. Great price and service with a smile. Will definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"Nice variety of fried foods. Not too hard to find. Hours are great for us late eaters. Mandy is a respectable dude, very attentive and cut me a deal on some extra cod! Some ppl dont lije the cornmeal breading but i luv it. Ive been looking for a good fish house and have been to a few in the area. Im from baltimore and washington state aka 2 of the best seafood cities, and Mandys aint up to that stardom but closest comparison in this area. If u know of better let me know. Gave 4 out of 5 because other than the owner the other workers are average, and the prices will dig in ya pocket a little bit."}
{"text":"Wow. My wife and I stopped for lunch and ordered two specials. 3 pieces of fish, 3 shrimp and 3 hush puppies with fries. She ordered the cod ($10.99) and I got the catfish ($9.99). We were pleased with the selections. The catfish had a cornmeal breading and the cod was an English breading.  The menu was full of things that we wanted to try, but the special had plenty of food. I especially liked the spicy red sauce that they make in house."}
{"text":"Went there hoping for some great fish and chips! The fish was great, had the \"Special\" which included 3 shrimp, 3 hush puppies, and fries! Both hubby and I did not care for the hush puppies! The Shrimp was great! The fries were not crispy enough, not a fan of crinkle cut fries to begin with but will eat a few if cooked right! Neither of us liked the tartar sauce or cocktail sauce but that's a personal choice! Don't like tartar sauce spicy, or cocktail sauce too spicy! Hubby chose to try 3 kinds of fish, he liked catfish best! I only tried the bass! All of our food was hot, which I was quite pleased! The people behind counter were friendly and helpful! All in all place was small but clean, which was a plus! Portion of fish is plenty, a good value and think I will order less next time!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly empty during lunch hour. No frills restaurant located off of the 28th Street /Washington light rail station. Had the three piece catfish meal with fries,  shrimp, hush puppies and a large drink for under $12. Meal is cooked to order instead of sitting in a bin under a heat lamp waiting for you. Generous portions, scalding hot, and unlike those other places comes with more fish than breading. Flavorful and great value. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"It's so difficult to find a good fish fry place in Phoenix but I think this is pretty good. I had the catfish and shrimp combo with fries. At first bite I was surprised at how great it was. Not bland at all like another nearby place. The shrimp was butterfly and the breading on both the catfish and the shrimp was really good....not too much and not too little. I think if you're looking for a place with good fried fish, you definitely need to check it out!!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all for good tasting food! Fish, chicken and shrimp! Good clean place. Friendly prompt service. Delivery via Uber eats!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. Randomly went here with some friends and I'll definitely be returning.  I had a 3 piece combo (catfish & whiting) with shrimp, fries and hush puppies. The whiting is really good, better than the catfish. Shrimp was good, glad the pieces weren't small. I liked the fries, soft vs. crunchy. I didn't make it to the hush puppies, that was the only thing that didn't look appetizing. I did try some fried okra, that was really good too.  The fried fish and seafood are really good. This place is relatively cheap. For $10 I don't know if there is a better option in Arizona. Definitely the best fried seafood I've had in Arizona.  This place is not in the best location, it's behind the light rail but it's worth finding."}
{"text":"This food was absolutely fresh and delicious.  Bobby, the cook that day was personable and outstanding in the preparation of our meal.  I had the cod and some oysters. Excellently cooked.  I highly recommend this restaurant for your seafood cravings."}
{"text":"Great selection of fried catfish, whiting, tilapia, bass and cod. I have tried all except the bass and thought all were very good. I especially liked how they used just the right amount of batter.  They also butterfly the fried shimp.  Great spot for fish."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for fried seafood. Catfish, whiting, clams, shrimp are all very good. The wings are also good. Everything is made to order and comes out hot out of the fryer. Very fair prices and great customer service."}
{"text":"Slow services, mediocre value and dull flavors.   If you are going for a gut bomb don't you want it to be the most wonderful gluttonous meal you can have? If so this may not be the place for your next calorie bender.   Inside an hard to access due to light rail old fast food joint you will find this place.  The menu is simple enough, But ordering will take some time as one person is the cashier, order taker, phone person and even waiter to bring over the food. I can only imagine the kitchen has the same setup as our food (alll fried) took nearly 30 min to get.   The fried fish it self was decent but nothing special, a bland cornmeal crust over white. fish.  IT was fresh testing but the bland breading did not due much. A big issue I also had was with their sauce rationing, why must I pay for more tartar sauce or cocktail sauce, is it my fault you did not put the flavor in the dish it self?"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips according to my mom and wife I don't touch the stuff , great burgers and onion rings"}
{"text":"Although I rounded up to 4 stars, I'd really rate it about a 3.8 if we could do decimals here on Yelp.  Short and to the point:  Service  - fairly quick, even for a Friday lunch.  Prices - very reasonable - $10 for a 2-piece entree and two sides  Fried Okra - excellent - about an 8 on a scale of 10. (  And I'm from TX, so I know me some good fried Okry.  )  Catfish - oddly shaped/sized - about 10 inches long and about an inch wide, with a slight twist.  Never had catfish shaped like this.  They were almost \"over-sized catfish tenders\" in a way.  Breading was basic cornmeal - did not notice any other spice.  They did however seem to be cooked for the PERFECT length of time - perfect crust, fish inside perfectly cooked and not dry at all, and no greasiness in sight.  I'd give this a higher score if the crust had a little more seasoning, but I give it about a 7 on a 10 scale.  French Fries - tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Potato salad - again, tasty but nothing to set it apart.  The bad:  My lunchmate had the fried Cod, and if they DO offer a second type of breading other than cornmeal, it was not offered or clearly marked on the menu, as far as we could see.  SO, because of that lack of info, his Cod came \"cornmeal breaded\" and he does not like that breading.  So he gives it 1 star for either not telling him or offering him the second crust option.  I'll be going back.  It's fairly close to both work and home, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"I stuffed myself...to an inappropriate level. Each piece of fish is perfectly crisp and fried. The oil is fresh so the fish is always light and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. They're secret is the cornmeal fry mixture they use. They also use it in their hushpuppies---TO DIE FOR!!! Next time i'm going for the slaw and sweet potato side.     This'll be my new late-night haunt for folks when they come to visit."}
{"text":"Was stuck out of town during Lent so I was put in charge of finding a place to get fish n chips while we were in Tempe.  I have to admit the place was probably better than the first one I called, but I would still call it average.  First, is child labor laws different in Arizona than California?  I went to pick up the food and the only person who seemed to be working in the place was this kid who I swear looked 12.  He was amazingly friendly, but I was kinda weirded out.    Food is good.  Not great, but good.  We ordered the 12 piece cod combo (for 3 people-huge mistake), and we were hoping it would be that golden batter that you would find at HS Salt or someplace like that.  Unfortunately, it had the fried catfish batter.  However, it was still good and we ate it happily.  The fries and deep fried mushrooms were also tasty.  But if you are looking for that golden batter, you may want to try someplace else."}
{"text":"Outstanding catfish and shrimp. I have two problems which aren't deal breakers to prevent be from returning.  #1 crisp up your fries #2 you need a signature sauce."}
{"text":"Not bad  Mandys Fish and Chips has a very large menu. They offer everything from fish, shrimp, wings, chicken nuggets, burgers, sandwiches, clam strips, hush puppies, and all the usual fried side items.    Mandy's Fish and Chips offers three kinds of fish, Cod, catfish, and tilapia.  I ordered the two piece cod.  My entree came with a side of fries and my sister and nephew had the chicken nuggets, shrimp, fries, and onion rings.  The meal was good. The fish was served hot and fresh as were the fries.  As I said the fish was good,  just nothing really stood out, maybe I'm just not a big fish and chips fan.  The staff at Mandy's are very friendly and accomdating and they have a menu online and you can order for delivery."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is awesome. Between the customer service and homemade style Fish, butterfly shrimp, and chips, we will definitely be a regular customer. Next time going to try the awesome looking burgers."}
{"text":"A MUST TRY! I RARELY give 5 Star reviews, but you'll see why when you stop in for a meal. Let me start by saying that the customer service here at the Avondale location was fantastic and made my first experience that much better!  Honestly I was a little hesitant to try this place because so often I'm disappointed in Fish and Chips places, however NO disappointment here! This place is amazing!!! As a Phoenix native the place we've had here since I was a little kid has consistently gone downhill over the years and I've had a hard time finding a replacement. But now I can stop searching because I've found it! I wanted to try a little bit of everything so I'll start first with the #1 English style Cod and Chips: The batter on the cod was wonderfully flavored, didn't overwhelm  the fish, and the cod itself was flaky and buttery. Exactly how it needs to be. #2 The English style Shrimp and Chips: Now I thought this would be the same batter as the cod but it most certainly was Not! It was crispier and also light, and I had shrimp in every bite, which in my opinion is the key to great seafood and chips. The batter/breading should never overpower the protein. #3 The Hot Wings: These were perfectly crispy and the sauce was slightly sweet/hot. These are better than most wing places I've been too! #4 Hush Puppies: At first I thought they were overcooked a little but no, they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. And will hit you with a lil bit of heat at the end of the bite which makes them better than most others I've had.  #5 Clam Strips: Also very crispy and not clammy at all. A great add-on to your meal. #6 Crinkle Cut Fries: Exactly as they should be! Crispy outside and soft inside.  The red cocktail sauce was incredible! It has sort of an Italian/spicy flare to it that I LOVED. And lastly the Tartar sauce was amazing as well! I've never been a huge fan of tartar sauce but it's really different than what you're used to. I'll be back next weekend for more!"}
{"text":"You seen the picture... It taste a good as it looks. Will tell friends about this place"}
{"text":"unfortunately I didnt like it. The breading covering the fish was like bird food. The fries was like any other fries out there. The service was bad. It was my first time there and I forgot to tell them I want the cod because I read in yelp that was the best. I guess the default was the catfish. It took a long time for the food to be ready. The only reason I gave it 1 stars was because the shrimp was not bad. I wish the breading for the shrimp was used for the fish I think that would have made a big difference. So this is a place I will not go again! Petes fish and chips all the way for me!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch for pick up here a couple of weeks ago for me and my co-worker. They told me 15 mins. Well I arrived in 30 mins and to my surprise my co-workers order was ready and mine was not. They tell me it will be ready in 10mins. I didn't order pick to arrive and wait another 10mins. Screw you guys I'll never be back!"}
{"text":"I went to the location on Southern and 16th street but didn't see that one listed so I decided to review this location, since it's the same food. I went in on my lunch break one day after a co-worker told me to check it out. I tried calling in advance, since on their flyer they advertise \"ready in 15 minutes\" if you call ahead and everytime I called, it was busy. I made sure to let them know that when I got there that had happened. They were checking into it before I left.  Staff was friendly. I ordered a catfish sandwich, fried okra and a drink for $9. Food took about 10 minutes to make but it was nice and cool inside the restaurant so I didn't mind waiting. I asked for ranch and tartar sauce on the side. The tartar sauce for some reason is really good and I don't even like tartar sauce! I ate it with my sandwich and fried okra. The okra was pretty good and they give you a lot for $2.99. The catfish on the other hand wasn't my favorite. I keep reading that everyone loves their catfish but there were pieces of mine in my sandwich half cut and that made me feel weird to eat it. I also didn't think it had much flavor and felt the cornmeal breading was similar looking and eating to bird feed.   They have a lot of choices; everything from fish to burgers so I think next time I will try something else. All in all, it was so-so. I would probably come back."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite fish and chip / seafood place to come and eat. The variety of fish in the variety of food is excellent and is all cooked very well and the staff is very friendly and I would definitely recommend this and come back for another round"}
{"text":"So the Proprietor of my favorite Fish and Chips \"Joint\" (Marilyn's on Central) mentioned that his Sister runs one close to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and this is it.  What I said about Marilyn's:             The fish? OMG, the best! Have had all three varieties of Fish (Cod, Catfish and                Whiting) but being from Boston, COD is my absolute favorite and this is the             very best \"Fried Cod\" I have ever had. Don't generally like Catfish, but Marilyn's             is terrific! Want to try ALL three, get the three pieces with one of each and you             will know which to order next time. The Owner has tremendous pride in what             he does and obviously, that can be seen in his \"Product.\" NOT fond of the              Tartar Sauce, but doesn't matter because the Fish is so extraordinary. Unlike             most Fish and Chip joints in Phoenix, the do NOT use the same batter on             everything. Makes a BIG difference.              You just can't go wrong and if you are like me, you will get a craving every             couple of weeks. FABULOUS!  This is also true of Mandy's except that the Tartar sauce is better and YOU have to select what batter is used! While Cod (priced a little higher) is still my favorite, have tried the Whiting and it is pretty terrific as well!  They do have two locations, have only been to the Jefferson one and have never had anything other than Fish and Shrimp. Why would I?"}
{"text":"Great selection of fish and chips! Well rounded menu and helpful counter staff. I will be back thank you!"}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing would definitely recommend the cod, cooked perfectly and Ice cream after was a great treat. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I will never ever go to Pete's again Mindys fish is fresh and just out of this world no more frozen for me"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Stopped by earlier in the week and was very surprised and satisfied with my food ! Fish is fresh and customer service is amazing ! Would defiantly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Omg so happy, my family came across this place! When I say the food is amazing I am being so seriously, the catfish was seasoned and cooked perfectly and the shrimp was so juicy and crispy. The homemade tarter and cocktail sauce was so delicious but the food was seasoned so well you didn't even need it. They actually charge 99cent for a full size Arizona tea which I love cuz most places try and charge you more. The waitress was amazing and so kind to my kiddos and made them feel so comfortable! They are a new facility in town and have gained us as customers for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Had a massive craving for catfish on a Sunday afternoon and wanted some cheap take out. Came across this place that is not too far from my hood and decided to give it a try.   I ordered the 3 piece catfish and chips and a side of clam strips. My catfish was amazing!! The fries, the poor fries, they were the only reason this wasn't a 5 star review. They were soggy and tasteless, but the fish and clams made up for it. This place is cheap and delicious and I will be back again soon.   Also tried the whitefish on their menu and it was really tasty as well.  Catfish is served ALL week long, yay!!"}
{"text":"Fish is great, service sucks! Second time coming here and waiting and waiting and waiting and nobody ever came. Never coming back. Going to Rose and Crown to salvage whats left of my lunch hour."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, I have eaten my share of catfish. I had not found a good catfish place in Arizona, that is, until today. After reading all the glowing reviews I had to try this place and it did not disappoint. The man behind the counter said it was the best in the Valley, but he was wrong. It is the best in the Southwest. I have lived in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and nowhere have I had such delightful fried catish. This place is 20 miles from my house, but I get the feeling they'll be seeing a lot more of me."}
{"text":"i was surprised to find a nice fish fry here in phx.  Fried whitings....an east coast favorite was well seasoned and yummy.  And  sweet potato pie!  Not cheap but not overly expensive. Nice seating booths. Near airport and light rail.  phx is a huge city with little jewels like this scattered about. Glad I found this one.  FYI area is a bit sketchy but it is light rail accessible."}
{"text":"If you truly love fish this is the spot. I went in at Mandys and ordered the cat combo which includes three catfish three shrimp and chips, truly it was the best decision ever."}
{"text":"Wow! Locally owned by military vets. Has a variety of menu items aside from the seafood.  Like that you can choose your batter--either the cornmeal way, or traditional beer batter \"English\" way. My father is from Maryland, and raves about their cheesesteak sub, which having it actually from Philly is a huge compliment. Overall, great place to try out!"}
{"text":"I decided to try it out after my brother recommended it to me. I loved the fish and chips! There are multiple options on the type of fish you can have, and I decided to get the fried fish and shrimp together. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of home! Excellent fish, shrimp, and the service was great. Can't wait to go back and try more! I'll take pictures next time!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. The restaurant is clean and the customer service was wonderful.   I ordered the shrimp and chips and fried calamari rings. I pretty much just paid $12 for seafood from the freezer section of the grocery store...  I knew better because of the price, but the reviews were really good. The shrimp was over battered and the calamari was rubbery. The fries were great, they just needed salt.   I hate the fact that no sauce is included, not one. You buy fish and you want tartar sauce with it, you pay $0.25... I mean c'mon one sauce should be included.   Anyway, give it a try, but for the price I could have bought a box of the same Van De Kamps shrimp they fried and a bag of fries."}
{"text":"Ordered the three fish and three shrimp combo it was delicious and well worth it! I ordered it using the Uber Eats App. Large portions at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"First it's better then it's alternative which seems to be Petes in the valley (way better). The prices are pretty good  The shrimp and chips were decent but for the price it what you would expect.  The mandy special for 8.99 is a better bang for your book..the workers are friendly and the wait isn't bad. Definitely would frequent again if I get the craving"}
{"text":"I was so surprised to find out Phoenix got it going on like this. I had UE deliver it. I had the catfish with added Bass. Where I'm from a lot of catfish places are hitting us with a bait and switch and hitting us with Swai fish, so i was hesitant. But what the hay, i took a chance & it was amazing. And for a good measure i gambled with the Bass. Bingo! So from a visitor, either Phoenix got fish or Mandy's is the bomb."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was really impressed by the high quality of the food and friendliness of staff. Had bass fish and chips that were awesome, no grease or fishy taste, just flaky white deliciousness!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews on Yelp, my husband, daughter and I decided to drive an extra hour to try out Mandy's Fish & Chips.  My daughter ordered the cheeseburger & fries while my husband and I opted for the Special, 3 fish & fries with 3 shrimps and 3 hush puppies.   My daughter enjoyed her cheeseburger.  Unfortunately, the Special was not so special for my husband and I.  The catfish and shrimp were all overcooked and composed of mostly of breading.  Since it was overly fried, the breading was hard and difficult to eat. We tried to peel off the crush but that left little meat.  We basically had to scrap the bits of fish off with our teeth.   The hush puppies were little round hockey pucks.  We didn't attempt to eat them to avoid a trip to the dentist.  Lastly, the French fries looked good but lacked seasoning.  We mistakenly saved it for last so were no longer hot by the time we noticed the lack of seasoning.  The salt just bounced off.   Needless to say, we were not full after our meal."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of days ago after reading the reviews here on yelp. I really didn't have high hopes but to my surprise the food tasted good. I had the 4 piece fish and fries. I only gave it 3 stars because of the location and the price. It is on the pricey side. As far as location, if you are not familiar with downtown Phoenix you might get confused trying to get to this place because it is on Jefferson, a one way street. Other than that, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there again tonight to try the fish.. the special was 3 pieces of fish, 3 shrimp and 3 hush puppies. I choose the white fish , and the cook used an english batter.. well I wasn't disappointed it was fantastic the batter wasn't thick at all which was great I actually could taste the fish. The flavor of the batter was awesome just right on the seasoning. The white fish was thick fresh and cooked to perfection , the shrimp were done nicely and the hush puppies had a tad bit to them..   I have found a new fish home , where they use quailty ingredients and prices are fair.. they also have some pretty tasty ice cream that we purchased on out first visit.. keep up the great product you now have another loyal customer."}
{"text":"I love this place customer service is assume and it feels like home. You can get almost any thing here from fish and chips to hot wings and Philly cheese steak. Lots of veriaty and good food....... and don't forget the desert. Great place good people, good food and a nice cook."}
{"text":"This location is isolated for being by the light rail. We stopped by on a Sunday at noon. There were no other customers at the time. The establishment is very clean and ventilated. The style has character and thankfully does not clutter the walls with kitchy decorations. The staff is very friendly as well as attentive. We ordered fried calamari rings and catfish shrimp combos with drinks. The prices are very reasonable, although there was a discrepancy on the chalk written price. The fish is freshly battered on the spot and the food is cooked in a timely manner. The batter and oil for each food item is specialized. The calamari rings were excellent with the marinara sauce. They were not too crunchy and not too rubbery, just perfect. The catfish came in three long strips over steak fries, three shrimp, and sides of sauces. Moist, tender, crunchy, and packed with flavor is how I would describe both the catfish and butterfly shrimp. The green tea reminds me of the imported teas in international markets in california. We will order from this place for office lunches in the future."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place, especially after trying that other joke of a Fish n chips joint (I'm looking at YOU, PETE'S! - why do people love Pete's? they literally serve you boxed, breaded fish that is sitting in the frozen aisle of any grocery store).  First impressions on driving up: Oh that looks ok. Hey, they have a drive thru! great!   ...try to use drive thru... no response at the intercom. Ok, well we have time to dine-in. We park the car and try to go inside. Door is locked. Maybe they're closed? nope, lights are on, people are inside. We tried to get in 2 more entrances before finally coming to the unlocked door.  Once we finally got in, the guy working the counter was nice and friendly. The fish was much better than Pete's but still not the best I've had. Coming from New Zealand, I realize now that I had a spoiled upbringing as far as when it comes to fish n chips!  Overall rating? Ehhh it's ok. Prices were decent, food is ok. I would probably come back if I had a craving and happened to be close by but otherwise I am going to keep looking for another place."}
{"text":"Get the fish! Skip the chips! Few things are better than a made-to-order, hand-breaded, fresh, fish sandwich. This catfish filet was NOT frozen. The cornmeal breading was very crunchy. Cooked perfectly. Light, flaky, NOT greasy at all. Just a perfect sandwich all around. Get this, the combo plate was only $6.50. Seriously? Awesome.  When asked if I wanted hot sauce or mayo on the sandwich, I replied, \"both.\" BEST DECISION EVER! The hot sauce adds the necessary flavor to the mildly seasoned breading while the mayo provides the creaminess that a tartar sauce adds without the overwhelming tartar flavor. (Note: I'm not a big tartar sauce fan b/c it hides the flavor of the fish).  So, skip the fries. They're just frozen potatoes that don't taste like anything. I'm still giving Mandy's 5 stars, because the sandwich was truly exceptional. And honestly, didn't come for the fries. But ask them which sides are made on site. The onion rings and fried okra are probably good.   PS-don't worry about it being catfish. It's seriously good. PPS-I grew up around a LOT of fish fries in Kentucky. No catfish has ever been this good. GO!"}
{"text":"One of the best fried catfish I've ever had!! I've been trying to find a fried catfish place in Avondale for years now and I've finally found it!!! Really delicious. Everything was cooked fresh and awesome prices! Great customer service! They have so many items on their menu, I can't wait to come back and try them all. I never leave yelp reviews but this place was fantastic and I'm more than happy to leave a review."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We weren't sure if we were in the right area to start with as you have to drive through a residential area, but there it was!   Really enjoyed the battered fish and chips, although the batter is definitely not British! Still good enough that we went back a few days later with our British friends. They enjoyed it too. Also tried the Jalapeño Poppers and the Hush Puppies.  Both times the service was great, but we were the only people in the restaurant. Food was fast and fresh.  Personally I think the fish is even better at Culver's, but Hubby much preferred Mandy's. We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"So delicious. Yum!! Great food and great service. Keep up the good work... I was very pleased with my choice. I had the cod with fries and I ordered some shrimp...it was all hot, crispy, and so very very tasty. It's a relief to have a great option so close to home."}
{"text":"I love coming service & food excellent !!!!!!"}
{"text":"visited for the first time today,  and really liked it.  Mandy was very friendly and talked over the menu with me it being my first time.  The Cod was amazing and juicy not greasy! I really liked the homemade cocktail sauce.  I am glad I stopped in and I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Mandy's has always been one of my favorite places to get fish they moved from 16th st and buckeye to 24th at and Jefferson and yes we make the drive and will continue to make the drive they don't just have great food they also have awesome employees willing to give there opinion like James who helped us out tonight thanks again James hopefully my family has a new favorite way to eat fish keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"The place is nice. We ordered some shrimp, zucchini a burger. I think it had potential but fries were soggy. Zucchini had that old oil taste.  I am pretty sure the fish would be really good as it is made fresh.  We will try again but be diligent with quality cause it was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times.... my boyfriend and I most recently came here because I wanted fish. He said he liked the burgers so I convinced him to take the train down here... since it is literally right off the train. For less than $20 we got a nice burger with fries, 3 pieces of fish (catfish, bass, and another type I can't remember) and 3 pieces of shrimp as well as a drink. The service was fairly quick and the food was really good... I don't know what people have against this place.... it is a family owned place and the owners are really nice."}
{"text":"For the price and quality of it, I give this 5 stars. It seems like a small hole in the wall. When you honestly take advantage of what they offer, you'll appreciate the food and go back for more because it's easily affordable."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place, was recommended by a friend. Cod fish wasn't crunchy on the outside as I prefer it. Also was sort of mushy on the inside and not firm as it should be. My woman didn't like her Catfish either. She said it was stringy and somewhat off flavored.   Cole Slaw was good. Well marinated and creamy. Fries were good. Shrimp was pretty good, approx 25-29 size but tasted a bit undercooked and mushy. Atmosphere good, this place is an old remodeled Church's Chicken and they did a good job. Counter girl was pleasant and informative. Unfortunately though bottom line is that the seafood product itself just had some issues. Perhaps execution with the cooking processes most likely."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best service in all of Arizona and their chicken wings are about the best things to have grazed my lips"}
{"text":"I was looking for Fish on a Friday with three kids in the car and didn't want to get out. No problem because Mandy ' s has a mother's most coveted convenience, a Drive through!  If you don't call ahead expect to wait because the fish is freshly cooked. Crispy, hot and delicious. We may have to make this a regular Friday event and add dessert. They have perfectly cooked sweet potatoes pie to satisfy that sweet tooth. Yum yum delicious Mandy's."}
{"text":"Delicious food.. Me and my family had dinner here and we were not disappointed! If you want good food and great service, this is the place. We will be back. The food was the bomb"}
{"text":"Surprised by this place. First time visit, had a variety of fish available to order. My wife had the catfish combo, I opted for the bass combo. 3 pieces of fish, 3 shrimp, 3 hush puppies, crinkle cut fries. Almost too much. All were very good. Bass was really good. Hush puppies had a little spice to them. Nice clean place, will go visit again."}
{"text":"I liked Mandy's because:   * It's right off the light rail, so I can travel from work to here in a matter of minutes without having to deal with traffic.   * Their catfish is wonderfully crispy and flavorful, pulled freshly out of the fryer.   * They serve catfish all week long.   But I'm not crazy about:   * Those odd crackhead sitting behind me acting like they were playing hookie from high school.   * The amount of time it took to prepare my meal. (Okay, this is one of those \"I want it fresh but I want it fast\" so I'll nullify the weight of this one.   * Decor was nonexistent.   If you're going and have limited time for lunch, I'd recommend calling in your order. All in all a very nice lunch and a good excuse to ride the rail over lunch."}
{"text":"First, i'm not a fish eating person. but i was meeting my friend for lunch yesterday and figured this would be a good place to start..we both commented on how cute its signage was and we remember it used to be over on Buckeye. but now it's firmly placed just off the 24th Street Light Rail exit on jefferson.  i was waiting around for my friend's train to arrive and the smell of Mandy's was intoxicating. i was getting hungry minute by minute. finally train arrives and we head over to the end of the light rail platform, jump over the rail gate and cross the street to Mandy's. yes..we could have done the right thing and walked all the way back to 24th street. but lets face it..why. its right there. RIGHT THERE~!!  anyways..so again..not being one to eat fishy creatures that once swam in water..i got the double cheese burger, some onion rings and a drink. friend got the Fish and chips combo. white fish..i think it was cod, they have the option to coat with corn meal, or London style. which im guessing is a beer batter. similar to how the onion rings were coated.  burger..cheesy, juicy, and very good. onion rings, cripsy-crunchy and full of onion flavor. fries..well..could be better..and i tried a small taste of the fish..it was good..for fish.   i highly recommend people check out Mandy's..i'm honestly shocked to be the first to review. SHOCKED..ok.  off the lightrail...just a couple minutes from the Priest train station.  not too far from Mill either. jump on this place.   OMG i almost forgot..they have Thrifty Brand Ice Cream. !!!!!!"}
