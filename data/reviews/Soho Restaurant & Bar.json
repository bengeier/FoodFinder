{"text":"I didn't know why I came here, maybe it's because I've ran out of places at Yonge & Finch to visit. This intersection used to be my domain when I was involved in a street gang. It was during my teenage years..it was like a whole season of the Young & the Stupid. Let's not go there.

I came here because it was called Soho.
I came in, went upstairs, checked out the crowd (korean [predictably]), and was told to go downstairs because all the tables were occupied. Downstairs? Downstairs downstairs?
The top floor was buzzing with people, and the main floor was your grandmother's house. I came here around 11pm, and was told that the kitchen was closed. Right, I'll have a liquid beverage, and so will my friend....

We went out for a cigarette, and a couple asked us whether the kitchen was open. I guaranteed her that it was closed and that she should find elsewhere to eat with her boyfriend. She went inside anyway just to verify. We finished our smoke and went back inside only to discover that the couple was sitting down with bowls of what looked to be food. I knew immediately that the waitress and I had a miscommunication..so I forcibly put on this exaggerated perplexed expression to display my shock. I apologized to them profusely. Then I confronted the waitress for giving me the false information, where it lead to her apologizing for the tenth time which included not having a table for me upstairs. 
We didn't end up getting any food because of the deployable service. We weren't impressed, even if the service came in the form of a short skirt and B-cups. 

This might have been a good experience if we were upstairs getting drunk at the intimately placed tables, conversing with loose Women and exchanging incriminating stories about ourselves to strangers who probably doesn't speak English. But that was not the case. 
We were downstairs where there were nobody was the two of us, drinking like War veterans with nothing to really talk about, wishing we were upstairs where the fun was. 

Five bucks to park here? Blast it all to Hell."}
{"text":"Post UYE at Yonge and Finch and us Yelpers were hankering for a few adult beverages, we ended up at SOHO to continue the Korean theme of the night. The place is literally across the street from Finch GO Station. As soon as you walk in the place looks kind of empty, but don't fret, just go right up the stairs and you will find an intimate little drinking area. 

We 4 yelpers decided to start with a soju cocktail; they only had two flavours remaining so we opted for peach over strawberry. The cocktail was delicious (and as Jen K pointed out quite girly), a sweet peach flavour with just a little alcoholic kick. I could have knocked these back for hours without feeling like I was consuming alcohol, making this a deadly concoction. Our second round consisted of small bottle of straight soju, I was not as big a fan of this as it had little flavour and was not highly alcoholic. However the soju is cheap and one could easily get drunk for a small price. 

In addition to the cocktails we were served complimentary Korean bar snacks, none of these really stood out (as Abbas pointed out the green beans with hot dogs were the best of the bunch), but hey its free food so I won't complain. The service was friendly and the place itself was not too loud so you could comfortably have a conversation with friends. If I am in the area looking for a couple of drinks I will definitely come back to SOHO."}

{"text":"Came here post UYE with an awesome group of Yelpers too fuel my alcoholism (jk??)

We went upstairs and Jenn really wanted to sit on the couches...alas they only had the couches available for 3 people...and we were 4...

But it was cool. Dim. We sat at a table meant for 8. 

We ordered the Peach Cocktail Soju.

Damn that shit was delicious. Colour me soju brahhhhh.

We also ordered a bottle of soju. Apparently I'm not supposed to do shots of this stuff. I say screw you haterzz.

Also, it came with free bar snacks! Gyoza, Soy Boiled Eggs, Fruit, and Hot Dogs and Green Beans (these were the best!!)


I will definitely be coming back here...so close to Finch Go STN....get drunk before going on the Viva anyone??

{"text":"Soho is a Korean soju bar. It's a slightly more sophisticated counter part to the Pojangmatcha Restaurant reviewed here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pojangmacha-restaurant-north-york

Soho offers a number of surprises for a basic Korean watering hole. It's got a patio. Yeah, given its right next to the Finch station's bus station, you'll be breathing bus fumes all night but then have you ever tried soju? Bus fumes are a welcome distraction 8 shots in.

Behind the cool black and red urban Soho signage is a really, really scary main floor. It gives the place a deserted look, save for someone sleeping something off on a bar chair. We might have turned around but Jennifer K noticed a stairway to our left leading up to something that could only promise better. And so it did.

We found a small bunch of young Koreans doing what small but young Korean do best: drink. Highly attractive and entirely accommodating waitresses led us to some widow-side couches and tables. The large room was better appointed than the Pojangmatcha Restaurant. We (Jennifer K. Wayne C, and me) had actually stopped at the Pojangmatcha Restaurant after a visit to Raa. If Jennifer K likes one thing more than 1970s/80s canto pop karaoke it's flavored soju. The kind found at the Pojangmatcha Restaurant. Pojangmatcha was our destination of choice but, alas despite an obviously empty table, the older male barkeep gave me the Korean x-d arms to indicate we have nothing here for you and we were turfed out into the night.

And then we remembered Soho. A brisk walk got us there. 

Bottles of flavored soju run about $10, come in flavors ranging from yogurt to mango to strawberry, and fill about 5 shot glasses nicely. This stuff goes down smooth and easy like wobbly pop and before I knew it I was about 5 shots in and drunk watching CNN after following a wall or was it Wayne? back to my condo.

Really pleasant was the gratis appetizer plate of a rolled Korean omelet, some fried balls of something that might have been cheese, and a sushi roll. 

Besides flavored soju, Makoli (Korean rice beer) is available for about $21 a liter before tax."}
{"text":"This is not a real review.

I'm posting this to ask anyone still looking at this page, for whatever reason, if they know what happened to Soho.

Where did they go? What happened to the owners? Did they relocate? Did they quit the business?

Soho wasn't the cleanest, best tasting, or least expensive place in the area, but they did do a few things right: 

Their kkanpunggi dish was not only delicious, but also huge - which is saying a lot for kkanpunggi in the Yonge & Finch area. 

Their sofas were comfortable. Almost too comfortable. You almost wanted to sleep in those things. 

Finally, it was just chill as fuck in there. The music, the food, the clientele, and the staff all contributed to some wonderful memories for my friends and I. We were served complimentary freezies one night in summer. Let that sink in.

Anyway, if you do know if the owners/chefs are still in the business, send me a message or write a follow-up review. Bar hopping in Y&F hasn't been the same since Soho."}
{"text":"Guy's Night out? Looking for Flavoured Soju around Yonge and Finch area.. that tasted like Kool Aid?? Can I said it feels like a Girl's Night Out?

When I walked into Soho.. I saw these ghetto like atmosphere with dirty dishes everywhere... a patron OD on something... I almost suggested let's go somewhere else till I heard noises of guy drinkings upstairs.. the connection..........

Sofas - that makes you feel like you at home... 
Lighting - dim and soft lighting put Wayne C into this relaxing chill out mood... 
Treats -  Karl R just almost finished the whole plate even before our drinks arrived.. Luckily I took a photo, if not I did not even realize what's in it!
Soju ($10) - Yogurt/Strawberry/Mango which we all enjoyed.. (wish I can try the other 3 flavours before we cut Karl R off!)

Soju Soju Soju! I love Soju! 

And Soho is a great Koren watering hole for a Girl/Guy's Night out!! 

Bottom ups!"}
