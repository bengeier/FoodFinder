{"text":"My first visit here was as good as it possibly could have been. Great, personal customer service, delicious iced latte, super fast wifi, and a LIFE-CHANGING blueberry muffin. Quiet, peaceful, and lovely setting. I'll definitely be frequenting this spot."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere at this place.  Very homey and comforting and the live music must be good.   The muffin we had was good with a home-made glaze added to it.  My double-espresso was pulled perfectly but I admit to being a bit underwhelmed by the medium-roast drip. As a coffee snob I wish they would do pour-over but keep the non-snobbish atmosphere which is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Really great place to study, have coffee, and/or buy a homemade bite to eat!  The blueberry muffins are some of the best I've had in Madison and they are baked right on the premises.  They also make soup, but get there before 1p or it might be all gone as it's a popular lunch menu item.  The staff always makes me feel welcome and they are quick to offer drink suggestions if I stare at the menu too long :)  Every Monday night from 5-7p they have Open Mic and drinks are 1/2 price from 5-6p (for what they've dubbed the \"happiest hour on Earth\").  The music is always good, but $1.75 beers make it sound even better :)  And now that the weather is nice, you can use their awesome back patio!  They are open everyday 7a-7p, so be sure to hit them up!"}
{"text":"This place feels like a coffee shop should feel. Cozy atmosphere, vintage styling with light jazz music to perk you up. The service is very personable and friendly, like you'd expect from a professional small business. Oh and the coffee? Outstanding! Will visit again soon.   Only 5$ min on CC, feel free to tip as well."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place is opening up again! They're now selling scones from the amazing Lazy Jane's, in addition to their yummy sandwiches. Word is they'll be cracking down on loud loitering in this new incarnation as well."}
{"text":"Great place if you want to sit in a coffee shop, listen to punk rock, and listen to the owners complain about how much they hate their life...which no one wants. Ever.  It kind of feels like your invading your neighbors family dinner. Probably a great place if they increase their professionalism. Can't comment on the food."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop! Friendly staff, local art and music. School days at lunch time can get hairy. Still highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Our coffee was full of grounds. Refills cost 50cents. Filled with students under 18 from about 11-2. Desserts are ok. Sandwiches better, try the blt on sourdough. Highlight was the staff. They are extremely nice."}
{"text":"The best coffee shop in Madison.  Good bye slow service, zero tables, and dark corners at Indie.  Hello bright sunlit rooms, quick friendly service, and indoor and outdoor spaces at the Froth House!  Not only do they have delicious coffee, but they serve a healthy lunch menu even equipped with a few vegan options.  They also have live music a few nights a week.  The owners are really sweet and love their customers.  I spent day and night here for two months while finishing my Masters thesis, and I always looked forward to coming back the next day.  As long as you don't mind a gaggle of Regent HS kids at lunchtime, or a walk/drive/bus/bike ride from your usual seat at Indie, this place is worth it.  I only wish they had a sister store in Houston!"}
{"text":"I was just so impressed with the personalized service I received the first time I went to Froth's. And all I ordered was a specialty tea and small pastry! I will definitely be back to try the food, especially after reading the review about the burrito. Loved the laid-back (non-sterile) atmosphere, too. Almost mistook it for an East Side establishment! The West Side could use more charming places like this..."}
{"text":"The best chai in Madison!! Aimee and Kelly were so inviting. The chocolate chip banana bread was delicious and homemade. The espresso had a velvety crema with a bright body and smooth finish. The vibe in the place is so inviting and chill. I love it and will definitely travel from Milwaukee again to visit the Froth House!"}
{"text":"Cute place, random location. Their popular sandwich, the Ben Franklin, was a standard turkey sandwich on a baguette, made unique by the red onion chutney and plating with Sriracha sauce.   There's back garden seating, but it's a bit rocky and dusty with no real shade so on a sunny day you'd likely prefer the indoor coziness. If I were in the area in search of a watering hole, I might stop by again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite independent coffee house in Madison. They have a very friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere with candles on the table in the morning and, clean. On some weekdays during the school year a lot of Madison West High School students have lunch. It lasts about 30 minutes. They play a great selection of music; have fresh baked goods every day, and a choice of coffee, espresso, and tea drinks. Sometimes the internet is spotty."}
{"text":"There are certainly better coffee houses in Madison. I decided to give the Froth House a try based on the location and the recommendation from someone else, and I was not impressed.  First, the good: The barista/ cashier was very friendly, even for a Monday morning. I ordered an espresso macchiato, and even though it wasn't on the menu she knew exactly what the drink was (espresso with a little foam).   Onto the not-so-good: first, the coffee seemed burned and a little sour - like the beans were a little too old to be served. My little espresso cup was chipped and dirty, and worst of all there were grounds in the bottom of the cup.   The place is perfectly comfortable if you just want to go sit and use the internet or read a book, but then again so is a library. Considering it's a coffee shop I'd expect a little more from the coffee."}
{"text":"Just visited the newly reopened Froth House and boy am I excited! The menu of simple fare of sandwiches and baked goods is limited but exceptional. Today I enjoyed the best mocha I've had in Madison--the milk perfectly frothed and the chocolate syrup suspended in the perfectly brewed coffee--YUM! I followed that up with a wonderful bagel sandwich called the New York, featuring herbed cream cheese, spinach and pickled onions on a wonderfully fresh whole wheat bagel. The bagels are New York style--chewy, and slightly crisp when toasted. Can't wait for another visit so that I can try everything they have to offer.   On this beautiful summer day, we enjoyed the charming patio behind the cafe, quiet and private despite being located near some busy roads--ideal for a lovely conversation.  The service is wonderful and neighborhood-oriented (the owner lives just a couple of blocks down from the cafe). Such a gem located in one of the most charming Madison neighborhoods.  Run, don't walk to The Froth House!"}
{"text":"Well, we just had our first espresso experience at The Froth House.  I must admit when it comes to espresso drinks I am a bit of a snob.  We make our living roasting and serving coffee, and espresso beverages in two establishments.  I am also adamant that went it comes to espresso there is a right way, and a wrong way to make a latte, cappuccino, etc.  The only way the employee knows is through training.  Judging by the techniques the \"barista\" used she had never had training.  The espresso shots were over-extracted and my latte had NO froth at all.  In fact, she placed the steaming pitcher on the drain tray and the sound of her steaming technique was like that of a cat being skinned alive!  We did not eat, so no opinion about the food. Atmosphere was as you would expect.... eclectic but that is what a coffee house should look like. Staff was friendly.  If you are looking for a quality espresso drink, I would take my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"So peaceful on a Sunday morning, as any coffee house should be. I was only able to try two things: a breakfast burrito and an iced mocha.  The iced mocha was on par with Panera's, which I love. It's more coffee than chocolate, just the way I like it. I practically inhaled that sucker...it never stood a chance.  The real surprise--and delight--was their breakfast burrito. Egg, spinach, tomato, cheese, and I think salsa. I didn't even know salsa was in it until I got the ends (it was cut in half cross-wise); normally a breakfast burrito with any type of sauce leaks like an old roof in a monsoon, but not this one. It was the neatest burrito I've ever had, and the addition of spinach and the MASSIVE tomato slices made it that much more fantastic. Do yourself a favor and try the burrito!  As for the staff, they are very sweet. You will be taken care of. :)"}
{"text":"Since Eric left the counter has been an absolute disaster.  In six weeks they still don't have someone that knows how to use the cash register or keep up with making coffee.  Being second in line generally means a fifteen minute wait while the cashier hunts for buttons on the register and then notices that all the carafes are empty."}
{"text":"I was recently at the Froth House when I played my guitar at their weekly Open Mic Night for the first time and it was absolutely awesome!! I'd definitely come to the Froth House again to perform at the Open Mic Night!! I also wanted to mention that the chocolate chip cookies are very delicious!! They were baked fresh out of the oven when I purchased one!! The people at the Froth House are very friendly and outgoing!! I'd highly recommend performing at the Open Mic Night if you have a great talent to show or at least just watching it!! It's absolutely entertaining!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiched between West High School and Regent Market Co-op, The Froth House steams up some pretty incredible espresso in a cozy brick building. I stopped in the other day after being alerted that they \"use real milk from a glass bottle\"! Sure enough, that glass bottle is Blue Marble Dairy. And if you don't know what that is, fine. Leaves more for me.  First visit, I ordered a cappucino and it was perfectly light and creamy. Truly. Better than many places in Seattle can make them. Second visit, I ordered another cappucino and, meh, it was more like a frothy latte and not hot enough. Still, it was a damn fine start to my morning.  The Froth House aims to be an Art House Cafe, according to their website, serving not only good food and drink, but also providing a community space for artists and musicians. The cafe is split into two rooms with lots of little black tables and pomegranate-colored walls; there's a patio that I need to check out as well. I browsed their menu and they have a number of affordable sandwiches and soup, but I have yet to eat there. I noticed this morning that they have a pre-paid lunch program where you can send a text or email before lunch and they'll have it ready for you to pick up. Cool!  I have a feeling I'll be braving many a wintery weekend morning, getting my froth on."}
{"text":"A great off-Monroe funky spot with a bunch of solid vegetarian options to the tune of: Mediterranean plate with hummus, artichoke hearts, olives, feta, and warm flatbread; Chipotle black bean burger; \"G'Bonzo\" chickpea sandwich; a meatless breakfast burrito. I tried the 2-Bean veggie chili which came with crusty bread, was deeee-licious, and only set me back $4. They have some vegan peanut butter chocolate yum yum cookies I will have to return to try! They've got live music EVERY NIGHT 5-6 pm and tons of cool local art on the walls. A great place to grab a coffee and work or read !"}
{"text":"The Froth House is indeed one I those great local cafés that Madison has to offer. I use to come here on a weekly bases when I was a student at West High School years ago. I fell in love with their Formaggio which is a basically a gourmet style grilled cheese sandwich. The butter they use is what makes this sandwich a fine dish. I also liked ordering their smoothies because they were so thick. Honestly, any one of their smoothies will serve as a meal. They are extremely fulfilling.   Really cool joint to check out if you're in the area. Seating can be problematic as it's a very tiny cafe."}
{"text":"If it weren't for Yelptern Izzy D and a Monroe-ish Street meeting we had scheduled, I probably would have never come across this place. Glad I did though... glad I did.   I have yet to chow down so I can't speak to their eats... I'll surely nab some nosh and let you know. What I CAN tell you is that the interior is awesome. Super chill, super quirky, but super quaint, so not the place to meet 10 of your besties for coffee. There are two sides, I like the side you enter on because I think it's a bit more active and I dig the furniture sitch. Staff is so welcoming, informative, and isn't quick to rush you out if you're working for a while. Java is solid.   Bonus points for having live music every night 5-6. This is what their sign says, this is what their staff says, though I haven't been for tunes yet.   Food and tunes anyone? Let's go!"}
{"text":"I liked this place, but I made the mistake of going during the local high school's lunchtime. The place was overrun with obnoxious teenagers. My advice: go in the morning or later afternoon. Froth House was unbearable around noon."}
{"text":"Neat little corner coffee house right outside the stadium area of campus. A bit of a walk for those on campus but worth it. I had the iced chai and was very happy. It's normal coffee house pricing. They have a back room for seating and have some spaces available to work but not much. Be sure to check the hours as I was there to meet a friend in the early afternoon and was surprised to be told they were closing soon."}
