{"text":"Came in on a Friday night to have dinner with the family food was ok, nothing to write home about.   Avoid coming to this place on the weekend if you want to have a conversation with your guest. The tacatacas and karaoke dj make it impossible for you to talk and enjoy your food. Its becomes a bar full of  depressed fat girls singing songs that make you want shoot yourself. Also, make sure you check your bill the wait staff tends to over charge. Too pricey for South Phoenix."}
{"text":"The best wood grilled fish bar none!

The camerones diablo is to die for!

Not to mention all the other choices on the menu, and some not on the menu!  Just ask and if they have the ingredients, they can cook it up for you!

{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I never wrote a review. I highly recommend this place for some fresh authentic Mexican seafood! They offer their ceviches in either Sinaloa or Nayarit Style (both are REALLY good!). Their Oysters are really good as well. While you're waiting they'll serve you with a complimentary chips and salsa (the best!) and a small cup of caldo. This place never disappoints. I would say you need to know Spanish to order."}
{"text":"I like the food here, really tasty. The tostadas de fish cevichi are soooo good Sinaloa or Nayarit style.  You can't go wrong. This past visit I had the cevichi de Cameron en coco. This is really flavorful and they serve the coconut water with it.  The staff is always helpful. To drink I usually get the Michilada. The down side is the music, I'm not a fan of the loud banda playing while your trying to eat. To avoid this go during lunch and sometimes this does not work. The parking-lot has only one lane entrance and exit so be careful."}
{"text":"By far the best Mariscos place with lots of flavor nothing bland about this place. Friendly  service very clean and fresh seafood They have karaoke  and beer bucket specials. I would eat here again. I lived in south phoenix all my life and was always curious."}
{"text":"The best ceviche I have had in the U.S. They have other thing I can't wait to try.  Very friendly staff.  Don't blink you will miss it."}
{"text":"Good mariscos and service was good but when I asked for more and chips & salsa which she brought but failed to let us know they charge if you want another round of it which was $7! They need to disclose that if you want more plus they don't give you enough, all I know it wasn't no $7 woth.  Thats my only complaint other than that it was good."}
{"text":"Seafood 'Mexican Style' is probably my favorite thing to eat. This nondescript restaurant on Central Ave in South Phoenix is right up there on my list of favorite spots. Walk into the windowless restaurant and you're greeted with typical
northern Mexican music and the sense that Sheriff Arpaio might come in and conduct a raid at any moment. That's exactly what I love about this place. 

The food is as fresh as seafood can be in the middle of the desert. I'm a commuter pilot and love seeking out hole-in-the wall places to eat. If you've had it with hotel or stale chain restaurants check this place out."}
{"text":"No reviews? It's probably because it's in South Phoenix and it's a small hole in the wall. 

They have the best cerviche (Sinaloa style) ever. Oh and you might need to know Spanish to order but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"It's my first time in here. As server referenced, we ordered Mariscado and it was BOMB! I loved it!

All the menu are about  the shrimp, calamari, fish, and seafood. I would like to go back (ASAP!) to try everything else! LOL! Call me if you guys need a company :-p! I am happy to come back again! :)

The service was fast, although the server couldn't speak English, but she understand English. 

The flavors was awesome, fishy but great! (Off course, it's a seafood restaurant, Duh).

The indoor decor very ordinary which is a plus because I felt like really in Mexico. From outside looked small but when you enter, it will be enough for everybody.

This place even have a musician to play the music as your requested, but he just say hi to us and left..lol...

So, Yes, I would like to recommended this place!"}
{"text":"Really love some good mariscos, thought I would give this place a try since I was nearby and the food is good but didn't get what I ordered, disappointed"}
{"text":"This is usually our go to for Mariscos. The food is always good. The seafood is always fresh. The shrimp caldo they bring out with the chips and salsa is strong it has dried shrimp flavor. If you like a seafood restaurant that doesn't have a band playing this is the place. It's a small place but its family oriented. We will visit again."}
{"text":"First time here, if your wanting a fancy place this is not it. It's a little on the smaller side, waitress was friendly and attentive. Food was delicious! A little spicy but good! Definitely be back! I liked that there was not a Banda when we came it's hard to eat and mingle with family or friends when it's so incredibly loud that even eating is uncomfortable. They did have music playing and it was loud but not so loud you couldn't hear each other."}
