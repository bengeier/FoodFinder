{"text":"The Cajun BBQ wings are some of the best I've ever had. If they had a bigger bourbon selection (read: Woodford's) I'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pricey, but delicious food. The staff is awesome. Down home hole in the wall. Great place for an after work drink and chat!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food.  Chicken wings are great as well as burgers and even hot dogs.  Very friendly clients."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Food is very good at a fair price. Beer is great!!! All of the waitresses are very sweet as well. The only thing I would say negative about it is that I wish it was bigger!! Everyone seems to enjoy this place so it is always packed!! Worth it though! Will definitely be back. One of our favorite places!"}
{"text":"If you like keg beer from the 1980's served over a Bunsen burner, this is the place for you. Also, if you like your waiter/waitress smoking heaters during his/her shift, this is also the place from you. 20 min wait before you place your food order with the prototypical eye roll. Make sure you wear t shirts because they don't believe in temperature control. Great food though. Def will be back. Gotta try the poppers"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food was good and reasonably priced. However, both times the place had an odd smell to it. Almost smells like a mix between sewage and urinals. I wont ever go back unless they get the odor under control..."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go and either grab a beer with a friend or have dinner with the family. Very friendly and it is crowded but not overcrowded. Award-winning wings and friendly service."}
{"text":"Keep in mind we started with a very low expectation the place is old and dirty. food was cold very below average would not go back ever.
Burger was a frozen patty and cold. Wings were small and cold. Fries with cheese and bacon look good but cold!"}
{"text":"Great local place to unwind. absolutely love the cajun bbq wings"}
{"text":"Sort of stinks when you walk in.  Wings were crispy, but flavors weren't what I was expecting.  Mild does not taste or look like mild sauce.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"I love this bar! Food is great and the staff is amazing. My bartender recommended the Cajun BBQ wings and I was beyond satisfied. I will definitely be coming here many more times. I love that it is not huge and has a good vibe. Great place!"}
{"text":"The Barrel is a great place to grab a fantastic meal and always a cold drink."}
{"text":"Very nice place to go,kids can even go here,the atmosphere is fun.Servers, and bartenders are friendly.The food is always good,and a great value for the money."}
{"text":"Great Taco Tuesday deal. Love the blackened grouper sandwich too!"}
{"text":"The best wings by far. Order the award wings they are the best. We go every Wed. it's wing night."}
{"text":"I still enjoy heading up to the Barrel for the Barrel burger but the wings have dropped out big time on my scale. They used to have the best dry rub wings in town but now they are a buttery soggy mess. It's not a coincidence either, since I've hopelessly tried on many occasions. I hope they fix them."}
{"text":"Had heard rumors that this is the place for wings on the West side...it did not disappoint!

My daughter and I gave this spot a try for a recent dinner outing.  We started by sharing a side salad with their (house) zinfandel vinaigrette dressing which was tangy and very tasty (great size to split).

As a side dish we ordered their onion rings which were plump and served with barrel sauce (like the sauce from an Outback bloomin' onion)...they were crispy and delicious.  Glad our waitress insisted we try the sauce!

We tried two different wing flavors...\"hot\" and garlic parmesan.  The hot wings were crispy and not overly sauced (maybe could have used a bit more sauce) and they had a distinct vinegar flavor nut definitely in the traditional Buffalo style.  The garlic parmesan wings were also crispy and on the drier side, but the flavor was pungent with a light garlic accent.

Good value for the price, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Where to start.....lol  Sat at the bar with the gf during football game and was generally ignored by the bartender.  Although she had no problem taking care of what could only be considered regulars since she knew their names.  Ordered several appetizers, which weren't bad, but not outstanding in any way.  Far from being the \"Best Wings in Westlake\" as advertised. The best part of the evening was listening to a middle aged drunk woman screaming \"Bring it all day...Bring it all day\" every time the football team she was cheering for scored. (They lost by the way and she was very unhappy) :(  Not the worst I've been in but won't be going back."}
{"text":"A neighborhood bar with decent food and several big screen TVs.  The wings were above average, but not life changing as some of the reviews would lead you to believe.  They only had 5 beers on tap, which I thought was sort of odd.  I found the service to be super friendly.  One of the regulars told me that the onion rings were top-notch, so I'll probably make a return visit when back in the area."}
{"text":"great food, love the fries, onion soup is to die for!  went on Thursday evening Lizzie was our waitress she is the best.  we both had the patty melt and it was as it should be good.  the service was good and food came out fast.  it was not as busy as it can usually be. i will be back  also love the tacos and wings"}
{"text":"Service was good. But I gave this place 3 stars because of the hype about their wings. Tried 4 different flavors... BBQ, grilled BBQ, Jerk and Parmesan garlic. Wings were ok, but nothing special. I expected to be blown away by the wings with all of the hype about having the best wings, but I thought they were small, a bit over cooked, and were just alright. I also got the French onion soup and was very disappointed. The cheese on top was charred so bad it made the soup taste burnt. I will possibly go back to try other things on the menu, but not one of my top places."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!  Craft brews featured. Fish fry got much better. Love the Cuban burger! Server was excellent at a very busy time. Nice local feel."}
{"text":"Good Popper burger, but small. Award winning Cajun BBQ Grilled Wings were ridiculously overcooked, Wood-like, and bereft of sauce. All in all a barely average affair. Without the coupon, I would've been sorely disappointed. Sadly, wing mediocrity is the CLE norm now other than Greenhouse. This is just another example. On to the next..."}
{"text":"Broken not sauced ( I asked for crispy extra sauce). .$1 a wing for what they served me is awful.  I feel like  I got taken. Never again."}
{"text":"Went to the Rusty Barrel to catch the simultaneous Browns and Cavs games. The place wasn't crowded but the bar was full. My burger and wings were excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here and we were immediately greeted & seated which was nice. Looks like the locals dine in on the daily. We ordered their spicy garlic dry rub chicken wings and boy was it good. The beer selection was great too. We may be returning again since we were given a rusty barrel points card!! Whooo hoo!!!"}
{"text":"I love this little bar. The food is really good. I don't really like wings and will only get them from here and Greenhouse Tavern. I get the cajun ones extra crispy. Also their subs are the best. I get the smokin barrel and swap the meats for turkey. The bread is so good, it's a sloppy and huge sandwich, and totally worth the calories. 
I recommend signing up for the membership card if you are the kind of person that likes to be rewarded with free food. My only criticism would be the service can be a little slow, but that's not a big deal. Now that I don't have Stamper's, this is my favorite neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"ok so we see on tv and decide lets go. its Wednesday wing night lets try it out ... travel all the way there and wait for a table 15-20 min. right before they seat us we are informed they don't have any more wings. REALLY !!  so since we waited already we didn't just walk out like others did that waited only to be told \"sorry we ran out\" that's when we noticed how dirty the tile floor was and then how black and nasty the carpet was. is this any indication of how they clean the rest of the place. sure all the tvs are nice sure they apologized and even gave us a card for 12 wings but didn't help much. so ordered nachos, skins a sandwich w/fries expected larger portions for the prices fresh cut fries were not cooked enough the skins were really good and the nachos were average as well as the very tiny chicken sandwich that was like something from a cafeteria. no I would never tell someone to go to a place this filthy even if they have good food. if you like dirty bars that serve mediocre bar food then you hit the jackpot here. servers and staff were nice but not great. and my appetizers came out AFTER MY SANDWICH even though I asked for them to come out first as APPETIZERS. get it together people is it really that hard. sorry new day cle. but can you recommend a place that's not a hole or a dive. thanks"}
{"text":"The place was crowded and had great beers on tap.  There was not enough help therefore service was slow and not friendly.  Food was good and good selection of beers."}
{"text":"Totally sucked.   Will never go back.  Burgers were horrible... overpriced.   And for one of the best wings in NEO... I couldn't tell. :("}
{"text":"I stop in quite often since I live so close. I am sad I didn't yelp about the RB earlier. Well, there's really not much to say except the girls that work here are extremely nice. The prices are cheap. There are usually two or three craft beers on draft to choose from at $4 and the food...... well let's just say stick with the burger.  You can't go wrong. The menu is pretty long but I just stick with that good old bacon cheeseburger. The RB is my dive bar of choice. I can stop in for a burger and beer for lunch before running errands or I can walk there and have a few and walk back home."}
{"text":"My first visit was an informal sales lunch. Since then I have been there twice. All three times I have to say I really enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and the staff.
Although the menu is really bar food they do it very well. I have sampled three different wing flavors and all were great. The Cajun BBQ so far is my favorite. Very good burgers and wraps also. Not a fancy place just a really nice neighborhood bar with great food and reasonable prices..."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout - 4 types of wings (Cajun bbq, hot garlic, teriyaki and six pepper garlic) were all excellent. They were cooked very well and they were all of decent size. 

The hot sauce has a little kick but isn't hard to handle. We will be back."}
{"text":"The rusty barrel is a well run establishments. The staff works hard, but they are always smiling, the interior is clean and cared for. The staff works together, helps each other, supports each other.  

The food was hot and flavorful. My wife and i had perch and A.Y.C.E. fish fry. Not \"Haunt Cuisine\" but a good honest meal and a good price. very tasty.

Karen is an excellent server; Gracious and attentive. We ask for her each time we visit. We will come back again and agian"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in to stress eat, that's what we do... Our go-to food is wings and we've read reviews of the rusty barrel that said they had good ones. 

First off, I nice little neighborhood bar, good setting, and some of the booths have their own little tv so you can watch stuff up close and personal. 

We didn't have to wait long for the wings, which were a decent size by the way. We ordered three flavors; their award winning Cajun bbq, pepper garlic, and the hot buffalo. 
I am not a huge fan of bbq on chicken in general but these were pretty good I'm not going to lie. The Parmesan wings were very flavorful and had the potential to be mind blowing but it wasn't unfortunately. The flavor was spot on but unfortunately being a dry rub it was as pleasant of a mouth feel. If they had somehow made that flavor into a sauce it would blow minds. Also the hot wings were good as usual. Kinda hard to not make a good classic hot wing. :)
In all a pretty good experience but could use some improvement."}
{"text":"The flagship wings are worth the hype. Westlaker hot dog is different and very good. People seem very friendly here. TVs are little run of the mill and hard to see in spots so not my ideal venue for an important game, but not a bad option at all with Dover Gardens, Panini's, and Winking Lizard all gone.

Update 7/30/17 - This place has a lot of problems and they're pretty well documented on here. No longer a patron myself."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with the family.  Everyone loved their meals.  My wife especially loved the Westlaker.  We will definitely be going back.  Thanks also for the great service!"}
{"text":"First time here-bar was packed so we took a table and were helped right away. Ran out of the Taco Special so they must be pretty good. Got the app platter and the buffalo dip. Standard bar food. Tables were nice with little tvs at each but ours didnt work. We were offered to move to another table but it wasnt that big of a deal to us. Server was very nice and attentive. Its no Dover Gardens but thank god its not Ironwood. I will try it out again as I enjoyed the lively yet chill atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for wing night as we heard they had some of the best wings around. bar is small with about 10-15 seats at bar and maybe 10 tables. 

Wings lived up to the hype. Wings were crisp and not soggy. Sauces were great.   Also ordered mozerella sticks and artichoke dip(average). The place was busy so service was very slow but the server apologize profusely so I give it a pass on that.   Parking is a little tricky as the lot is super small.  We will be back since the wings were so good!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the deal for $10 for $20. Ordered a couple of beers and a couple of burgers. I order and the black and blue burger and my partner ordered the bottom of the barrel burger. We asked for medium and they were way over medium in our regards; however I will take taste over preference. Both burgers were amazing. The fries were delicious; and the chips..yum. definitely worth a visit if you are in the Westlake area."}
{"text":"The Rusty Barrel was a finalist for wings in 2015, so I decided to check it out. My wings arrived dry and about 4 were downright puny. Also, the blue cheese dressing looked runny- not very appetizing.. My companion had the burger and beer special. Burger was spectacularly bland, optional slaw was ok but chopped way too fine.  One bright spot- our server was very professional and prompt."}
{"text":"I've been here several Times over the last 12-15 months. Bartenders are very cliquey. But always get order to go with little issue. Tonight I get a to go order and was shorted so I went back asking for a credit and was accused of lying. Completely rude staff. I will not go back"}
{"text":"What can I say.  You can't Judge a book by its cover.   This place has great bar food.  Not good great. The grilled bbq wings are special. The atmosphere is cozy and it is the best place in Westlake by far.  They have a touchtunes jukebox with great music u can play with ur phone.   It's awesome.  Beer choices are plentifull."}
{"text":"The grilled cajun bbq wings are amazing. Always great service and a great dining experience here."}
{"text":"First time visitor. Def a locals hangout but it was fun. Food was good. I got a salad and my husband ordered three different types of wings - they were awesome!  Beer selection is above average but I wish they had more on draft. Probably 50 different bottle beers. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Have been here more times than I care to admit and each time the service gets WORSE! I only go there because it's close to my place of employment and my coworkers and I like to stop out after work occasionally and get a bite to eat and have a few cocktails and it's a convenient location. Never again. This past Friday we were completely ignored  by the bartender, who was to busy flirting with the regulars and doing shots all night . The whole time, the owner was sitting just a few bar stools over getting his own drink on!
(I only know that because my coworker had a complaint about her food and when she informed the bartender, she basically told her \"too bad, take it up with him\") Rude, nasty bartenders, ok food and clueless owner!!!!  Stay Away!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bar food.  My bf had a salad and I had the tacos, $1 special on Tuesday.  Ok but I won't rush back"}
{"text":"Great Tacos on Tuesday,  80 different beers and a friendly staff.  It's not the Ritz but it is good food and easy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh my god it smells like sewage there. The owner is standing at the bar like the patron's should accept his fowel version of under performing as an owner. Get a clue. This is a reoccurring problem that he doesn't seem to want to invest the money for 
a solution. I feel sorry for this guy."}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday night at dinner time (7-ish). Scary parking lot. Very tight and hard to turn around in. Service was extremely slow, possibly the worst I have ever experienced. We ordered the all-you-can-eat fish dinner. Very small portions, mostly just breading and fries. Took over fifteen minutes between re-orders. The food we saw con=ming out for other patrons (other items) looked very good. I won't go again."}
{"text":"Interior is dark, with a few screens but not really a sports bar. Service was slow and server did not know the draft offerings, which were limited to 1-2 craft beers. Food was adequate but nothing exciting."}
{"text":"Good/fun environment
Awesome wings and sandwiches for a great price.
Reasonable price on beer with a great selection!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour around, great food and drinks! This place has the best prices on drinks! My husband and I went on a Friday night and although it was busy we sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice and attentive. I ordered a glass of wine and was told since we were there during happy hour it would be $2.50! I don't know of any place that serves wine that cheap, and it was good wine! I had the Mediterranean wrap which was very good and my husband had the Cuban sandwich which was recommended. Good choice! The food is very good, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Go here when we get the taste for good wings close to home nothing fancy here neighborhood bar my favorite wings are the grilled BBQ that is their award winning wing recently tried the sesame ginger and six pepper garlic that were also very good the bottom of the barrel burger is also good.

They always have Cleveland sports on and drink specials and even show the world cup happy hour mon, thru fri, 4 to 7."}
{"text":"First time here.  Definitely will come back.  Tried two different wings the Cajun BBQ and the 6 spice dry rub.  Awesome.  Used the yelp 10/20 and worth every cent."}
{"text":"I'm never a person to complain but we sat at a table with a beer and had two waitresses look at us and ignore us. Hand to god not ONCE had ANYBODY give us a menu let alone walk by and say \"how are you guys?\". I will NEVER EVER walk in this door again"}
{"text":"Great food at good prices. The booths have there own tvs. It's a good place to watch sports. Voted #3 best wings in NE Ohio"}
{"text":"Great bar and great people. Ashley is a fun exciting bartender. They have a nice jukebox with a lot of music. Nice small bar that is sure to start some good conversations with people you don't know. Definitely my go to bar!"}
{"text":"This place has my favorite wings in Cleveland.  You have to go with the Grilled Cajun Barbecue. Dining area is small but they offer carry out also."}
{"text":"Good service. Great wings. And definitely one of the better, if not best, beer selection in tiny little suburbia Westlake... Though that could be a bias because they always have my favorite (left hand milk stout nitro). The parking lot can feel a little crowded and it can be awkward to get in and out of but just be careful and very wary of crossing traffic."}
{"text":"A super neighborhood bar.  it's getting harder and harder to find local taverns pride themselves with good food and great service.  The Barrel has both.  The all you can eat fish fry is great. Oh and the lobster bisque is famous on the Westside of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, but nothing special. Good prices. The two servers working were on their phones the whole time."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall feel! Awesome burgers! Power hour on Fridays is fun too! The staff is really nice! The only thing I would change is adding more craft beers to the list :) all though there's already a pretty good selection."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST most addictive wings in town! I love wings and have had them in MANY restaurants in the area but when I stumbled on to Rusty Barrel, I was hooked. Their mild wings are super tasty (my old go-to) but after seeing all the awards for the Cajun grilled wings, I just had to try them! And now I see why they are award winning. They come out hot with very apparent grill marks on the exterior and a sticky brown glaze. The sauce is incredibly well balanced- sweet, tangy, mildly spicy with a lovely vinegar kick. Trust me, you can't eat just one! The service is always friendly and all the bartenders and servers and just lovely! Especially Michelle! The interior of the building is a clean, one room, bar and tables. TVs everywhere including individual TVs and remotes for the booths. Overall, a great neighborhood bar with great beer and even better food!"}
