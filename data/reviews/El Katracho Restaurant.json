{"text":"If you have a whole evening to wait for the bowl of soup you can definitely visit this place....
We walked through the door at 5:20 and walked out at 6:55pm... All I ordered was a bowl of beef soup and something that looked like a localized version of taco called baleada (which for $3 consisted of tortilla and 2 or 3 chunks of very salty meat). Asked for cup of water and was sold a bottle instead (I hate when restaurants do it). Will never come back unless I want to be bored to death with bachata music and irritated by a disco lights in my food plate."}
{"text":"This place has blown us away. 1st timers the food took a little bit longer than expected but the food was not disappointing at all there is only one person in the kitchen making these Foods from scratch the prices are very reasonable and all of the food has great flavor great seasoning we had two items that's we have never had and to the pupusas we're here very delicious we will return if I have to say one bad thing will be the Disco lights during the day it's kind of weird"}
{"text":"Not sure what the food taste lke---BECAUSE the service was ABSOLUTELY horrible! Well the waitress was HORRIBLE!! She didn't bring our drinks with ice, straw, nor a napkin!!!! She took our order incorrectly! She didn't bring nachos accordingly....jst horrible service. When plates arrived, one of the plates didn't evn belong to us(it belonged to the person at table next to us). She never once apologized...when we ordered second round of drinks she AGAIN, failed to remember. The food took forever to come-wit never a friendly assurance or explanation of what happened. Nd whn the check arrived, she had the audacity to charge for a plate tht was never touched nd continued to IGNORE the situation."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's really close to home and in an easy location, and looked really clean. I guess it's so clean because there were no customers. The server was super nice (hence 2 stars instead of 1). 

The chips with sauce were good. SAUCE, not salsa. It was a thick sauce squirted on the chips with parmesan sprinkled on. This also contributes to the 2 stars instead of 1. 

Now, I need to preface this by saying I am not a picky eater at all and there are extremely few foods I can't enjoy. Seriously, I'm the kid who ate the other kids' peas because they didn't like them and we couldn't leave the table until all our plates were clean. I cannot remember the last time I went to a restaurant where I really could not enjoy the food. When I travel to other countries with friends and they're whining they don't like the food, I'm gobbling it up with a smile. I like all kinds of foods!

But man. I just could not enjoy the food here. It was really not good. Way too salty, and everything just had a weird taste.

I had the pescado al mojo de ajo. (Grilled fish with garlic) My fish portion was very small and super salty. Way too salty. The salad was sad. The rice had a weird coconut taste. The beans - what looked sort of like refried beans hand-smushed into an awkward oblong shape on my plate - had a weird taste I cannot even explain. They were even placed kind of away from everything else on my plate, so they looked even more weird and lonely. They were definitely the worst thing on the plate, so it was almost like the other foods had shunned the poor weird beanstuff. I couldn't eat the beanstuff or the rice. I tried a few bites, couldn't do it. I did eat the super-salty fish and sad salad because I was hungry and could tolerate those. 

It also took a long time to get the food. We were there an hour+ and we were the only customers. 

Other reviews said the food is slow \"but worth it\" so we didn't have a problem waiting. But, well, the food was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Really good!!!! Highly recommend! Fast service, and fresh delicious food! Hand made flour tortillas with Beleadas, fresco de Nance is the best! Good service too... visited on Wednesday night, we were the only ones there... they have a nice entertainment space... open floor... will definitely recommend & visit again!"}
{"text":"This is what I have been waiting for in Vegas! A good Honduran restaurant. i went with my family, we had the staple Honduran soda \"Banana\" and the agua de nance was great. Baleadas, and tajadas de platano were really good. And they do karaoke on saturday which I was very excited about. I recommend it! It took me back to the food I have in Honduras."}
{"text":"Es un lugar delicioso para comer  amable servicio.. y Un buen ambiente para parejas y familias.. limpio y amplio. .."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in for Happy Hour after she'd picked up the to go menu which advertised 2 for 1 margaritas. Walking into the place I think we woke the guy resting his head on the bar. The place was hot, like the AC was barely on. But we opted to give it a try, at least one round.
So we ordered margaritas and looked at the menu. We noticed there was no mention of happy hour at all so when our drinks finally arrived we asked. The server said, \"no, these $6.99 each.\" 
Hmm, ok then. Definitely only one round.

We ordered baleadas, which were advertised on the menu for 2 for $2.75. They were fine, nothing special. And when the check came, we were charged a different, more expensive price.

We were the only customers and service was still incredibly slow. 
Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food, good customer service. Baleadas are on point. Nance drink is delicious  I came from California and decided to give it a try glad I did because now I have a spot to come to when in town"}
{"text":"Very bad food and service. Dry and over salted grilled chicken. Owner said it's not his problem"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Today I tried their sopa de caracol and so far the best I've tried from any other Honduran restaurant... the tajadas con pollo is also bomb! So excited to have a new Honduran restaurant 2 miles away from home! I'll be going to this place over and over again!"}
{"text":"Best service ever from Salvadorian waiter, Margaritas very overpriced served in small fluted martini glasses- $6.95 (watered dozen w/ no flavor. Good food, 1 cook, totally empty @ 9mp.. Although only opened 2 months. .pet peeve every other food item we asked for on their menu  \"they were out of \" ????????.... Very excellent attentive service, very clean place, music not too loud.....bad location in ghost town mall and a dark parking lot...."}
{"text":"A good find. They have a huge menu and large portions. I felt like I was at a good friends house having dinner. They feature many Central American cuisines. Only thing not
Working for them is a very slow location."}
{"text":"Omg first time coming here . Food was amazing loved it . Took longer than usual but that's because they actually make the food fresh. For was extra hot like I like and service was great ."}
{"text":"Just a bad experience, will never return. Food came out one by one, my dads tortillas that were supposed to come with his meal came after he was all done. We ask if they had a taco salad which is a salad in a taco shell and he said yes, but we inly got a salad which was chopped up lettuce and pieces of chicken. My tostada with shrimp and octopus had shrimp and fish. If you didn't have octopus you should notify your customer instead of throwing in anything you'd like. I ask for a jarritos and the server didnt even ask what flavir and brought me a tamarind which was disgusting. I found out they had fruit punch by looking in their refrigerator. The food was mushy, super salty, and a waste of 40 bucks and waste of my time."}
{"text":"Excelente lo mejor en las Vegas la sopa siete mares las más rica que eh comido ..!!   La atención es de lo mejor"}
{"text":"I love Honduran food because it reminds me of back home. It's hard to find authentic Honduran food her in the Las Vegas area. I have tried to eat here many times and the customer service is horrible! I called 2 days ago to order some baleadas and the owner told me that he didn't have the 3 baleadas for $7.50 and he did which is on his website. Because of the horrible service I didn't purchase my food there. I gave this place another chance and now they don't make baleadas until after 2 when the first time I called they were going to make them and I called them at the same time. Noon. Just horrible experience overall."}
{"text":"I just got back from this place and the food was horrible! I spend $30 for 2 items on the menu. The
Fried chicken and tajadas was all cabbage and the chicken was very undercooked it had blood in it. It was disgusting to say the least. I ordered the plantains with refried beans, sour cream and cheese. Well, it had no cheese they forgot it. I agree with another reviewer that the refried beans had a weird taste.  And the portion of the plantains was so minuscule. Overall I do not recommend this place to anyone. Stay away! Food is completely overpriced  and mediocre and it's no wonder that place is always empty."}
{"text":"Food is OK, service awful, nobody came to make sure everything was fine, tortillas came late and cold, fajitas don't come with tortillas! You have to pay them separate, really?  No fountain drinks...we were the only ones there and still late service and the waitress didn't utter a word to us, not even when taking the order. Mm not coming back ...."}
{"text":"Excelente servicio! La comida deliciosa, yo soy de Los Angeles y no eh probado mejor comida q esta. Probe las baleadas, la sopa de caracol, el desayuno katracho... una delicia! Volvere cada vez que visite las vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Honduran restaurants in the states: Miami, Houston, dallas, San Francisco. This is perhaps the best one out of all. Baleadas are simple but making them taste delicious is difficult. The tortillas here are the right thickness, softness, and freshness! The tajadas were fresh and yummy. I got the sanwhich ceibeño and the chicken was perfect along with everything. Highly recommend this place. Very nice
Place to dine in. Clean and a warm environment with pictures representing Honduran culture and traditions. Good customer service and prices are about 11 dollars average for a large dinner and baleadas being much less. I recommend and def will stop by next time I'm in Las Vegas! They also have sopa de mariscos with coconut for 20 dollars which is the same price as in atoaran. I didn't try it but assuming that everything else was great I'm assuming it is too. Horchata was good but a bit too sweet in my opinion"}
{"text":"Realmente devo admitir que la comida estubo deliciosa...muy muy exelete ...es mas que perfecta .esquisita...pero le doy 2 estrellas por que el servicio brindado por la camarera fue horrible...parecia que ella estaba en un funeral..ni una sola sonrrisa y ni nada profecional..no tenia conocimiento ninguno de los platos del menu..y cada ves que le decia gracias solo se dava la vuelta y se marchaba.uno como cliente espera una respuesta como ...de nada...o ..un placee...lo que nesesiten ...yo trabaje como food server..y aunque no te agrade el cliente. Tienes que hacer sentir el cliente como en casa. Que se sienta lo mas comodo posible..solo mejora tu carisma y aprende del menu y seran 5 estrellas. Suerte"}
