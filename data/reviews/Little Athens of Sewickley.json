{"text":"My first impression of this restaurant was not a great one since the waitress corrected my pronunciation of gyro (sounds like year-o) with \"jiiiii-ro.\"  I didn't correct her because it was really hard not to laugh, but my husband did laugh.  We got there a little after the breakfast buffett which looked interesting and I wish I oculd have tried.  However, we decided to opt for the lemon chicken soup and the gyro and fries.  The lemon chicken soup was good and it wasn't too lemony.  The gyro was very good with a ton of meat.  The gyro sauce, tzatziki, was pretty good, but a little on the thick side.  I would NOT recommend getting the fries as they were over cooked and the oil didn't taste very good.  The restaurant had very good portions for the price.  If I get a chance, I would like to go back and try their buffet and some of their other dishes as they had a very good assortment of items.  If I get a chance to go again, and change my mind, I'll definitely repost my thoughts."}
{"text":"This is some of the worst service I've ever experienced.  The waitress was outright hostile (openly complaining and guesturing to the owner in our presence), making us wait over 20 minutes for our check when we asked her to split it up (mind you, we were just asking her to split it in half, since there were clearly two separate families seated at the table).  The food wasn't very good, and was somewhat overpriced.  I see they've recently remodeled, but I'll never go back after that."}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite Greek restaurant, and nothing in San Francisco has topped it.  Since my time in Pittsburgh has been rather limited the last few years, it's been at least 3 years since I dined here, but I'm happy to report that it's just as excellent as ever.  I would love to get my hands on the lemon potatoes recipe.  Very generous portions at reasonable prices."}
