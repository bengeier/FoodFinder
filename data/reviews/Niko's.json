{"text":"My first time going to Niko's was a very pleasant experience all around.  The food was great, and very reasonably priced.  There is a variety of Greek wines and drinks to order from the bar, and the service was great.  The restaurant itself is very clean, and comfortable to be in.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some good Greek food!  Ordering the Hummus and Pita as an appetizer is a must, and the best I've had, anywhere."}
{"text":"I attended a Cleveland Scene event here last week, actually a happy hour event and I could not have been more pleased with everything.  The bar area is adorable, the staff is adorable and the dining room is adorable.  It is safe to say that I was pleasantly surprised with my experience, since it seemed like a hole-in-the-wall spot in Lakewood.  Always on the hunt for good Greek/Middle Eastern dips I eagerly ordered the 3 out of 4 dips appetizer (hummus, garlic eggplant and feta with roasted red pepper) and they were all amazing.  The hummus was creamy and had a good garlic taste, I was expecting the eggplant to be more like Baba but it had a choppier texture and more of a sweet taste and the feta gave my taste buds a run for their money.   Definitely recommend for an evening out with friends and good ethnic food."}
{"text":"Niko's doesn't have a lengthy multi-page menu nor does it confuse itself by offering Greek & Lebanese items. Niko's offers a one page menu of very well made & excellently presented truly Greek offerings. Nestled at the center of Lakewood restaurant row this place is doing great Greek food.   We had the baked Feta with warm soft pita triangles for appetizer. The cheese was baked just right to the right melt factor with right mix of tomato. The Lamb Shank entree was to die for with perfect flavor and melt in your mouth trendiness. The green beans made in traditional Greek style was not at all overpowering in garlic or tanginess. The bar tender, Nathan, made me a Cucumber martini upon request - though not on the menu - thoughtfully added his signature to it - floating a sweet liqueur at the bottom - check out the pic I uploaded for this restaurant. We also tried the Mousaka - one of the better ones I've had in some time. This eggplant & spiced ground beef layered combo was mouth watering.  Our server - Ariana was attentive, friendly & checking up on us just at the right times throughout our meal ( I hate it when you just took a bite & the server comes over and asks how does everything taste).   Niko's is definitely multi repeat place for me. There are several other staple Greek dishes I can't wait to taste, from their menu. If the quality is consistent I can't imagine why I wouldn't expect an excellent time the next time."}
{"text":"I crave the chicken and lemon soup and red pepper feta dip. The mezze platter was huge...humongous...ginormous and everything on it was very flavorful - the gyro meat was especially delicious. Our server had waited on us the previous weekend at Reddstone and amazed us by ratting off the exact food and drinks we had ordered then! I think the parking lot behind the restaurant can get full rather quickly, so recommend keeping your eyes open for street parking starting a couple of blocks before the restaurant."}
{"text":"Boo! They're closed! Sadness. CLE needs more good Greek food!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to add that last night we finished our leftovers from our visit on Monday evening and the food was every bit as good as we thought then.  I really do encourage visiting Niko's. We are absolutely going back next week."}
{"text":"Sold.  No more Niko's.  So delicious though.  I think he's trying to open another smaller shop.  Apparently, an Irish Sports Bar will be taking the place.  That's necessary.."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Lakewood! Great happy hour $2 Domestics $3 imports $5 martinis, $5 appetizers. The only place that has Quality Greek Food in Cleveland!"}
