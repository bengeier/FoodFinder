{"text":"Located in downtown near the hotels, Deli 500 offers an okay lunch service. It has a combination sit-in with take section (convenient for those who want to go back to their offices quickly). I was quickly seated, but the waiter took a bit longer than expected before coming to take my order (smoked meat sandwich combo). The food also took somewhat longer than expected. Unfortunately, the food was not worth the wait. The smoked meat is bland. The coleslaw was runny. The pickle was not even crunchy. Fries were okay. The waiter, again, took a while before getting my bill.
Overall: good place to grab a quick lunch, and get back right into work at the office. The sit-in experience leaves a lot to be desired. So-so food with slow service. There are so many other options around Montreal that I would say to avoid this one if you get a chance to have a long lunch."}
{"text":"Bad service !! 
Tasteless food with too much salt !
I guess they are striving on guests from out of town in the nearby hotels  ..
Will never be back .."}
{"text":"alwayscome for a late quick lunch alone and then everything is fast. Their fries are the best."}
{"text":"This place is seriously underrated on yelp. It's a  nice place for a quick lunch. The food is good for the price. Better than Mcgill cafe anyway."}
{"text":"This restaurant locates in the basement of a business building. The food here is better than average quality in large portion. When you need a comfort meal, this is the place to go. They offer really good lunch deal at around $15 for a combo of soup, main, dessert and coffee."}
