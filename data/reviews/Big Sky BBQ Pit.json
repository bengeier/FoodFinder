{"text":"The meat is good lots of smoky flavor and lots of portions.  Fun decor and the patio is nice.  However, they need to ditch the potatoes sides. You could tell they were re-heated.  The texture was just not there.

Lots of the food is spicy if you like that.  The sasage is spicy and so is the corn bread.  I found the pulled pork with with the apple bbq sauce was the best of the meats."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for a while. Pros: food was decent, open concept, easy access, friendly staff, desserts are great. Cons: expensive, irritating to have to pay for food, dessert and beverages separately, setup is a bit odd - has a lot of potential to be much better."}
{"text":"My wife and son and I went for lunch.  Been meaning to try this place for awhile and had heard mixed reviews.  We tried the 5 meat platter and my son had the chicken sandwich.  Platter was only meat, no sides (not what i expected).  Everything but the chicken was cold.  Ribs were very dry even when I added sauce.  Pulled was okay but cold.  Brisket was juicy but fatty and cold.  Sausage was okay.  We had to order our drinks separately and then pay for them separately at the end ($14) for 1 beer and 2 pops!  I really wanted this place to be good, we were so looking forward to enjoying this place with friends and family.  I hate to give a bad review, but it could have been so much better.  Unfortunately I won't be back."}
{"text":"A little taste of Texas here in Alberta! Good eats.  Hungry man platter is the best place to start, priced right and good sized portions and if you don't eat it all, they'll wrap it and you can take it home. If you like good BBQ, don't drive by!!!  I wish this place lots of success!"}
{"text":"Solid bbq and great that the owner is super friendly and welcoming . He gave great introduction to the menu and recommendations . We had super high hope for this place ..  and we want to like it because it's closer to us then Hayden block and Big T . 
The carnivorous meal arrived and everything was looking good and delicious with all the 5 featured meats. 1: chicken BBQ was awesome and out of this world .. so good 2) brisket ; has good size and amount but it was so dry and cold on each ends. I was shocked 3) pull pork was YEs yes yes ! Delicious 4) ribs was once again cold and dry and too smoked up.. felt like each charcoal .. I'm sorry 5) sausage was amazing !!!  
Side dishes are lacking the usual bacon !!! Way to conservative with the bacon amount... I dot know why ... I think we only for 3-4 bits of bacon ... :( 
Overall ; great place to eat and drinks .. Hayden block still hold our number 1 spot ! So far !"}
{"text":"Figuring I could kill two birds with one stone, I decided to have lunch while I was in Okotoks since I'm rarely in the area. 

Their menu is short and sweet: meats, sides and desserts. I ordered the ribs and brisket with coleslaw and smoked cheddar bacon potatoes for sides and enjoyed some sun on a picnic bench as I waited.

I opted to eat outside, 1) because it was so dang nice out and 2) because I didn't want to smell super smokey from sitting inside.

I normally don't dip into BBQ sauce, but I took the root beer and granny apple ones to try since they're homemade and they were pretty tasty!

The ribs were perfectly smoked and fall off the bone good. The brisket was fattier than my liking but still flavorful. Didn't care for the coleslaw but man, the potatoes were awesome! The potatoes were sliced up smothered in cheese and bacon and reminded me of scalloped potatoes. 

Of course, I had to make room for their candied bacon apple crisp. Chunks of apple and crumble drizzled with whipped cream and caramel topped with crisp bacon strips? Un-friggen-believable!

If I ever make the trek down south again, I'm gonna have that apple crisp with a side of potatoes as my meal!"}
{"text":"Came here today for a late lunch and we were very impressed! Obviously recently opened, this down home, no frills, authentic BBQ joint is definitely somewhere to go for a casual meal. The meat is smoked on location, so the smell entices you as soon as you get out of your car. The menu is small, and reasonably priced, the food is made fresh daily, so once they are out of an item that is it. We both ordered the burnt ends and a side of bacon baked beans ($9.99 for burnt ends + 1 side) and both were delish!! The beans were loaded with meat and a generous amount of whisky in the mix. The meat was tender and not fatty, plus there was a nice selection of sauces to accompany your meal. 

The decor is sparse but clean, the focus is obviously on the food. Like I mentioned, no frills, down to earth and good food at reasonable prices for the amount of protein you are getting. Not huge servings, but just right - we left full and satisfied but not stuffed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere and great food. I had the hungry platter with 3 meats. Took leftovers home. Will be going back to try more for sure"}
{"text":"I compare this place to Holy Smoke in Calgary. As far as the taste of the ribs go.
The restaurant itself is relatively big inside. On the day of my visit they had a waitress that took orders at the table. They use an iPad ordering system and call your name when your meal is ready.
You get a choice of 1 side with your meal entrees. I had the coleslaw, my son the baked beans. The coleslaw is vinegar based not creamy like the waitress told me. That being said the baked beans were the better of the two sides. 
Not visible from the highway is a huge outdoor picnic area. I did a quick rough count, and if you seat 10 to a table  you could theoretically seat another 300 people.
I'd like to come back on a nice warm sunny day. It was nice tonight, but the wind really picked up.
In conclusion, I'd like to come back and sample some of the platters.
It's a nice space ! 
Side note; I like the way the takeout orders get given out to drive through customer's. (Long hook).  Oh yeah, They also have an app to pre order."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday drive to Okotoks, what do we see off Highway 2A  a place called Big Sky BBQ Pit.  Got out of the car and wham!!!   The great smell of BBQ coming from the joint.  This place is not fancy very by any means has a cowboy western feel, or more rustic.  Staff very friendly and gave us a rundown on the menu.  
  The Menu were do I start they have plate size to feed 8-10 people, 2-6, 2-4 people.  Choices of meat sides and the portions are huge!!!! Texas Big!!
  We had the brisket sandwich that was $13.99/$16.99 depends on the portion you want.  Comes with a side we chose corn bread. Thick fluffy corn bread the brisket came on thick homemade bread. My mouth is starting to water just thinking out what we eat there.  
The menu brisket, ribs, chicken, pork and more....  my goodness if my tummy were bigger I would've tried it all. we'll just have to go back and try something else from the menu. 
Parking is not a problem seating is inside or out.  They can accommodate big groups or small they have it all.  
I'm so going back for more best BBQ by far in the Calgary area!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal BBQ. They are making some pretty great adjustments since opening. I have had the pulled pork, brisket and ribs. All of them are fantastic. The pulled pork had a nice smoked bark to it that was delicious. Not the biggest fan of the mac n cheese, but the baked beans and hog spuds were great.

Portion sizes are great.

This place can only get better from here, come summer time I could see it being a great place to hang out especially if they throw some benches out front.

Rob is a great guy, and makes an effort to greet everyone that comes in the door. Rylies Cattle Barn wasn't the same without him, very happy to have him back, and better than ever."}
{"text":"My experience at this establishment was okay the concept of the establishment was different the food was ok it was cooked but for some odd reason was cold don't know why"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, I was genuinly excited to try it.
Then I tried it.
It was a legitimate let down. I ordered burnt ends, something that I have enjoyed since a kid. They were MEH. The cornbread was pretty good, but the potatoes... OH GOD THE POTATOES. Grainy and salty... Yet oddly flavorless,  even with pulled pork and gravy on them. These potatoes come from a box. And for 5 bucks, I want real potatoes. Wouldn't really recommend this place unless you're just passing by and can't make it into okotoks for some real food."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place.  Really friendly staff, great food for a very reasonable price.
Will definitely return.

Very impressed with the simple menu of great bbq food."}
{"text":"Visited this past Sunday with the family and met a friend and his kids there for lunch. This was our first visit. The atmosphere is great, nice big open space, big long picnic tables, reminded me of some of the great BBQ places I have had the pleasure of eating at in Texas (minus the smoke blackened walls that only come with age and a wood fired pit).
Nice variety on the menu, ordered our food and a few minutes later we were called up for our order. Another Texas BBQ similarity is the food served simply on trays with butcher paper, no plates. 
Daughter number one and I shared a half pound of brisket while my wife and daughter two both went with the pulled pork sandwich (kid size for the little one, nice option).  They serve the brisket and other meats without sauce...the way it should be. They offer a few different sauces on the side if you want them, and the couple I tried were tasty. We also had sides of coleslaw and their bacon and beans. Nice creamy coleslaw with a bit of tang which I enjoyed and the beans were a show stopper. Tasty, thick sauce and chunks of meat in there with the beans, delicious. I also ordered up a link if the jalape√±o cheese sausage. Tasty with a nice kick. I'm told the pulled pork sandwiches were good. The brisket was just ok. I found it a little tough and there wasn't much of a bark on it. 
Definitely worth a trip back, and I would like to try the ribs on my next visit. 
The one thing I would suggest changing was having to pay for your food and drinks separately, not the most convenient setup. 

March 1, 2018 update: I have been back to Big Sky 3 times in the last month or so. The food remains fantastic and the brisket is better than my earlier visit. They have also switched up the ordering process. You now order everything at your table from a server and pick up your food at the counter when they call you. Much better and just one bill for everything. We also took some desserts to go on one of the visits and they were great. I had the apple crisp, my daughter had the chocolate chip cookie and my wife had the peach cobbler. She found the cobbler a little smoky. The apple crisp was excellent, but the cookie stole the show. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but we got kicked out of our seats by the manger or owner because a couple regulars were coming in. We paid and we were then straight away moved while the regulars were walking through the car park. Absolutely disgusting. I asked why we were moved. Oh they come here every day was the answer. So what!!!!! Worst feeling I've felt after spending $100 at a bbq place for just two of us."}
{"text":"I have been to Big sky a few times. Always great food. Owner is very friendly and welcoming. 
Food has great flavour. Home made BBQ sauce as well. 
Drive thru big enough for a tractor trailer"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Restaurant in okotoks, probably in the Calgary area. We have fiends that come from out of town and we take them there and they can't wait for their next visit."}
{"text":"We visited on New Years Eve at 6pm. It was really quiet so we worried that they may want to close soon, but we ordered anyway. It was only 6, after all. 
You order your food separately from your drinks. Your server will take your drink order and then you go up to the kitchen window to order your food. 
I ordered the ribs and hubby ordered the meat platter. 
My ribs were dry (I'm assuming I got the last of the batch), but the pulled pork was awesome (I took some from my husbands portion). He said his beef was good too and same with the chicken. My ribs were really good when coated with one of the four different BBQ sauces I took. The root beer, big sky and the grainy mustard were my faves.
The beans were the HIGHLIGHT. Omg so good. They have pulled pork mixed in with the beans too. Mmmmmmm!
Coleslaw is also yummy!!
The beer is also good :)
Service was great too. Very kind staff. 
I only rate it as a 3/5 due to the rush of needing to get out and the dryness of my ribs, but again, I'm sure it was only because we got there right before closing that night."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! Best BBQ in and around Calgary without a doubt hands down!!! If you have a hunkering for bbq get your meat on at Big Sky Bbq!!!"}
{"text":"Very good portion sizes and great meat. When they say serves 1-2 people, I would lean closer to 2 people. 

Food was great"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now and haven't enjoyed anything, which completely goes against my 2 strikes and your out rule. I have traveled the south and know bbq, and smoke at home, and was so excited for this place. But after long waits when not really that busy, combined with super high prices for the portion size, and bbq really isn't that good, I will not be back. It's a shame, I prefer mom and pop places which we are lacking in this area but this place isn't it.

One thing I need to add is the appalling behavior or the owner. They have these stupid bar seats near the line and he trys to force you to sit in them. They are completely in the way of everything!  The 2nd time I was there people were leaning on a table near the front waiting, which is usual for this place, and he told them all to move! He then started lecturing them about not holding up the table and to use the stupid bar stools. The 3rd and final time same old story. If you want to treat your customers like that with long waits and sub standard food, good luck staying in business."}
{"text":"Stopped today while on the road down here on a Saturday afternoon just before the dinner rush. Live music was a very nice surprise. Had the Hungry Man Platter - 3 meats and beans. Pulled pork was very moist and tasted great. Sausage was a good size and a bit spicy (good thing) and a bit dry (also a good thing - I hate greasy smoked sausage) I recommend the sausage. Brisket was also moist and flavourful. The beans that come with the 3 meat platter were hot and had more pork in them, again flavourful. $19.99 for that
I ordered the side of Hog Spuds as the Cashier was a master up seller . They are baby golden potatoes wrapped in bacon and smoked, served with sour cream. Recommended these too, only I would like a couple more of them for $8 as they looked kind of sparse in the serving tray.  Cute cashier uphold me on a $3.50 bottle of Coke (355ml) that sucked - I did not expect Cineplex pricing on the pop. 
Overall, value was average $35 for a single diner. Flavour was on point. Established  is clean and appropriately smells like delicious smoke. Staff are attentive. Decor is cool. I was initially going to give a 4 Star due to pricing but the Blues duo playing in here is really good! Good enough that people stop eating to applaud. 
I live in Edmonton, but the next time I an in this neck of the woods I will be back. I am an avid backyard smoker and can say these guys are doing it right!"}
{"text":"Well I tell you what it ain't nothin close to good ol Texas BBQ. My family ordered the pulled pork and brisket sandwhich both of them were dry, they didn't have all of the items on the menu, the mac n cheese was soggy the cornbread was dry, the potatoes were unappealing and lacked flavor, and last but not least the house made BBQ sauces were not filled. Maybe the BBQ would be better if you lost the A&M flag. Hook em all the way baby!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place and were let down. Sadly, they don't know the basics and even cut the brisket against the gain. The brisket was seriously dried out and chewy and the cold mac and cheese was quite the acquired taste. 

The smoker was inside so we all left with a lingering smoke smell on our clothes and hair. The hog spud were fairly good which is why I have two stars.

It's super expensive as well. $12 for a a very small brisket sandwich and one side. The adult sized portion was $15. $7 for 6 baby potatoes wrapped in bacon. Yikes!!

I honestly would recommend this place but I always try a place once."}
{"text":"Sigh, three strikes you're out. This is my third time here each time has been progressively more disappointing than the last. I want to love this place I really do it has a great location the atmosphere is amazing it's a great building. Like I say it has a lot going for it. Alas the food leaves much to be desired it is hit and miss at best. Tonight the brisket was unbelievably dry and its brisket, brisket should not be dry. The portion sizes in my opinion are too small for what you're paying and just in general the food is subpar. If you're looking for a place to go and have a beer this is probably your place but if you're going and looking for outstanding barbecue this is not your place.

I don't know what the answer is to this place, they really need to step it up. With places in Calgary Hayden Block, Holy Smoke and others this place falls far short  and is fortunate to not be located closer to the competition."}
{"text":"Ordered Carnivorous platter. Was good but it got cold really fast. Nice place cold beer great service."}
