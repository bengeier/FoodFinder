{"text":"So me and 4 of my friends wanted to spend a few days together camping and eating hotdogs. However the disrespectful, rude lady at the front desk refused to let us camp. Even though on the phone they let us register. She had a very annoyed and inhospitable attitude and she was not helpful with our predicament. This was a recurring issue throughout our whole stay at Punderson. I really hope this one employee is not a reflection of the park as a whole."}
{"text":"Went to the Cherry Dining room for thanksgiving dinner and our party of 4 had 2:30 reservations we did not get seated till 3:50. Yes an hour and twenty minutes! And we only got seated after I made a scene because they where taking a party of 10 in that had 3:00 reservations. Once seated at a still dirty table the server half a$$ cleaned it and the linens where wet (good thing because I finished cleaning the table with it) and they didn't even give us silverware till we asked them twice. We've been there before for holidays and never had a problem. On a side note the food was good and probably would have been better if we were in a better mode. I hope they can fix the manager problem but I'll probably will never go back."}
{"text":"I'm an event coordinator for a sales department for a big company in Cleveland. For our quarterly meeting we decided to do something off the beaten path and head to Punderson for a two night stay....little did my fellow coworkers know that it is haunted.   From the beginning of the planning approximately a month or two before the event through the time of checkout we experienced only excellence in customer service and attention to detail, much of the kudos goes to the group sales representative, Amy Otto.   First the accomodations- We stayed in the gorgeous and historic manor house. My coworkers stayed in the new wing and as the coordinator of the event they put me in an Estate King room in the older haunted part of the house as a free courtesy. I did not see my coworkers rooms, however I can tell you that my room was very comfortable, spacious and full of that creaky old character only found in historic houses that have been preserved over time.  Our conference room was the parlour which was also located in the older wing. It was comfortable, the perfect size for us (a group of 10), and the views of the lake were breathtaking. If you are coming with a smaller group, I highly suggest the parlour (However it is located on the second floor, so it's not ideal if any of your group has mobility issues since there is no elevator)  Second the food- Every single meal that we had catered was fresh, on time, delicious and exactly what we ordered. Perhaps my only small complaint is that due to the staff size the bar (which is usually only serviced by one individual) often closes at an early hour and if you are the only one looking for a drink you might have to hunt down a bartender. Nevertheless, this didn't bother our boozy group and drinks flowed throughout the course of the meeting.   Third the ambiance and service- Our group was very intrigued by the ghost stories, of which there is no short supply. My coworkers would ask the Punderson staff about their own personal stories and the staff welcomed the questions and willingly shared their tales. Prior to dinner our second day Amanda, one of the wait staff actually took us upstairs into the attic and secret tower room (located above the parlour), they also took us into the Windsor Suite, which is supposedly the most haunted place in the manor, this earned MAJOR points with me and everyone in our group. It was certainly the hightlight of the trip. While we unfortunately didn't have any ghost stories to add to the many legends upon our checkout we did thoroughly enjoy watching over our shoulder and sleeping with the lights on.   As a coordinator who has planned many offsite events I cannot recommend Punderson enough. The venue has that certain je ne sais quoi about it that one would not expect to find in America, let alone tucked away in the farmlands of Ohio. The service absolutely matched quality of the accommodations and the warmth of the staff warmed the manor like the morning sun warms the beautiful dining room in the early hours of the morning. My only regret was that I couldn't thoroughly enjoy the highly recommended trails and outdoor activities, although that leaves something for our next visit."}
{"text":"Just held a company meeting there last week, stayed 2 nights. Will not be back.  Upon arrival - the outside looked shabby & creepy, the front desk was like something out of a Laundromat.  My room was dark & stunk to high heaven - but I don't like to complain (normally) so I sprayed some of my perfume & opened the window. Dinner was so so: don't have the fish - 3 of us ordered 3 of the fish dishes & they all were overcooked  -The only positive was the cheerful & accommodating waiter/bartender Joey (he was the ONLY bright spot of the entire stay). Upon meeting up with my co-workers the next morning - I learned that the waitress berated them for not having a reservation & was quite rude about it (granted maybe I should have but there were only 3 other people seated in the dining room & we were only a party of 9 not 19.)- Needless to say the waitress carried her attitude the whole service- & it took 45 minutes for us to get our eggs - ridiculous. Lunch started out with a new waitress telling us that they didn't have the bacon dressing for the spinach salad. ok - how about ranch dressing for the cobb salad?  Nope.  We found a different venue for dinner that night.- Bass Lake Tavern & Inn - & it was so great!  We should have stayed there!!"}
{"text":"Left serval voicemails, completed an online request forms in order to information about possibly hosting a wedding. I had to call 4 times and speak with the general manager to finally get a call back. Once I spoke to someone I was supposed to get rates for a wedding and service offered emailed to me. I never received an email. Needless to say I will not be planning a wedding here."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the friendly staff and their willingness to address all of your concerns. We had a large family group of 20 and we made reservations well over a year ago. It wasn't until about a week before the stay that we were told would have to pre-order all of our meals for the entire three-day weekend to make sure everyone got what they wanted. While this was inconvenient we did it. The staff were wonderful throughout the process but I was definitely not pleased. Some of us ordered salads and soup or appetizers and all of the food came out at the same time. They obviously pre-cooked all of the food had it sitting on warm plates to serve it all together some of it was cold some of it was hot some of it was good some of it was awful. One person in our group pre-ordered a grilled a steak. The steak came out encrusted with gritty coffee grounds and a chili rub, not grilled. We needed to sent it back and we were not able to order another steak and got crab cakes instead. Extremely limited options for vegetarians. Some of the food was absolutely amazing some was not edible.  Don't even attempt to eat the breakfast buffet.      There is a service door on the 2nd floor the staff use located right next to one of the rooms where there were young children sleeping. The staff would slam this door all day long and all day night making it very hard for people on the guestrooms to sleep. One of the guestrooms in our party had a very very strong sewage smell to it we were told it was due to construction. It was not possible for the couple to stay in this room they had  young children so we offered them our room and they upgraded us to a cabin, the only option available. While this was nice we were now away from the rest of our group and had to drive to the lodge for all of our meals. And while the cabin is nice there's a very tiny standup shower with water the barely trickles out.  Needs a lot of upgrades. Again The staff were incredibly friendly during this entire process.     I would not stay here again based on the food and the accommodations.  I do not think this facility is able to handle groups over 4. They do have a pool but it was very cold and there is no hot tub."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night for a birthday party. The location is beautiful, scenery is right on the lake, very picturesque, one of the prettier places around. Food on the other hand, that another story altogether! Appetizers were decent at best, nothing special on bruschetta or quasadilla or even an Oriental salad, just basic stuff. My beef Wellington and pastry was a bit dry, I left most of the pastry on the side and didn't eat it and meat was a bit chewy. My wife's original order, eggplant Napoleon was very raw and inedible, we had to send it back. The replacement order of Cod was very under seasoned and lacked on flavor. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. But only if the food matched the scenery and the staff."}
{"text":"We had  Hillside Cabin (4) with a great view of the lake..very relaxing location. The cabin was clean and well maintained. If they had more comfortable chairs to sit out on patio I would of rated it 5 stars.. they had plastic chairs. The dinning room at hotel seemed overpriced and not very good. I would recommend stocking up on food and grilling out. Our cabin had two picnic tables one outside by grill the other on screened in porch with view of lake."}
{"text":"Great if you want to get away. It's by Amish country so you are away from a city. The manor is kinda run down though...i wish they would update it or upkeep it better. They do offer public swimming for their pool some days which is nice."}
{"text":"Back in Cleveland's Golden Era, when Johnny Rockefeller and his ilk plundered the natural resources of our state in their quest to amass personal riches that would make Buffett and Gates blush, every robber baron needed a country estate, preferably on a lake.  That's how we came to have Punderson Manor.  Okay, it's far more convoluted (and considerably less interesting) than that, but let's get back to the review.  Stayed over the weekend at this smallish, 31-room state-park-owned lodge.  It sits above beautiful Punderson Lake in a quasi-wilderness setting that belies its proximity to Cleveland and suburbia in Geauga County.  We were able, due to the time of year, to snag the Windsor Suite with separate living room, bedroom and spa.  The prices are very reasonable, but keep in mind:  You're still in Geauga County.  This ain't Malibu.  This ain't even Traverse City.  We looked at one of the standard rooms, which seem pretty nice, and the cabins, which, for a family outing would be great in the summer, but chose the suite for our de-compression weekend.  For the bucks, it's a steal.  The manor itself is an interesting bit of architecture, but through the decades many architects, designers and builders have had their way with the old broad, and it shows.  Rooms, hallways, wings, turrets seem cobbled onto what was perhaps once a grand residence.  The overall impression I took away was that they came very, very close to accomplishing a nice building, but missed by allowing government committee to decide everything.  For example, the indoor pool addition, by itself, is grand:  open-beamed ceiling, tall windows and doors on three sides overlooking the lake, magnificent.  But it sure isn't of the same era, or even design intent of the rest of the structure.  Those of questionable intellect hold that the place is haunted by spirits of past occupants.   I'll tell you what haunted me:  The morons who partied all night in the tiny lobby, attempting to play the piano.  Oh, and then the Muzak that starts up in the lobby, the restaurant, the pool area and continues all effing day.  Uninspired, unnecessary, and un-listenable.  Cut that crap out.  They claim to have wi-fi, but we were told \"they tried to fix it and gave up.\"  Still, a charge appeared on our bill, which upon my protest was removed.  This was a theme that emerged throughout the weekend, baffled front desk, confused wait staff, lack-luster employees wandering the halls.  I doubt I would return, but the prices are okay if you have something planned either in the park or near-by.  \"The way to make money is to buy when blood is running in the streets.\" John D. Rockefeller"}
{"text":"There were only 2 tables in the dining room today and it still took over an hour for us to get our slightly-below-average food. When we gently brought it up to the manager, she made an excuse about having a group that needed a buffet and tables outside that were being served. Weak excuses for weak service."}
{"text":"Hard to beat this place is far as a view brunch goes. They had a buffet for $9ish per person, including children. It included coffee or tea, I believe, with pop and juice costing three dollars more.  I was pleasantly surprised at the food quality and flavors that were there. There were pancakes, biscuits, gravy, sausage bacon and assorted pastries.  The manor looks out over Punderson reservoir and that is the major draw for us when we go there anyway. Take a walk on the boardwalk after you eat!"}
{"text":"Impressed, honestly.  Maybe it's because I had no expectations, but hotel at a state park doesn't necessarily scream great accommodations to me.  I was wrong (Jian got it on his first guess).  The rooms here were nicely updated, large enough, with newly renovated bathrooms.  Nice heating and cooling system and comfortable (if not a little firm) beds.  Stayed here with a newborn and the walls were decently thick as well...so double bonus for those guests staying in adjacent rooms to ours.    We also attended a wedding reception here and it was pretty nice as well.  A little tight on space for the amount of people there, but nice surroundings in the Maple Room, along with an adjacent outdoor space for even more partying.  Food was above average for catering at an event like this.    Sunday brunch was a little pricey, but had some good selections (plus an omelet station...man it's exciting to watch food cooked).    The grounds are beautiful and there is not only a lovelii lake, but many hiking trails available.  If I lived closer, I'd be a regular visitor."}
{"text":"Punderson Manor left me not wanting to book another room anytime soon Pros:  beautiful scenery as it is located in the state park 2 nice pools - both indoor and outdoor Cons:  Rooms are not spacious and are kind of worn looking Steps everywhere to get to rooms and inside.  Tough to lug your luggage around, but staff will help if you ask. Common area is almost non existent.  If you want to get out of your room you need to go the bar/restaurant or outside. Restaurant was not good at all and our service was terrible. Had to keep fending off the flies while we ate.  In fact, we complained at the front desk and receive a refund."}
