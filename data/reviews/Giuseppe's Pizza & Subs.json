{"text":"Honestly the best pizza in all of Cleveland!  There are pizza and pasta paces virtually on every corner in Cleveland, Ohio but Giuseppe's uses the freshest, highest quality ingredients possible.  The cavatelli is spectacular and the Sicilian style pizza is simply fabulous.  I live in San Francisco, which claims to have the best Italian food outside of Italy but there is nothing tat comes close to the outstanding, authentic Italian food at Giuseppe's.  There are several locations of the restaurant and we sampled the food at the Mentor and Wickliffe places - both were fabulous.  The homemade salad dressings are wonderful as is the perfectly crisp lettuce.  The pastas, pizza ad subs are seriously great.  The portions are enormous so go with a big appetite.  You will be delighted with the quality and value of the food here so go often for the best pizza and pasta anywhere around.  Giuseppe's offers delicious, fresh, honest Italian pizza - just like momma used to make.  Love it - can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza!  Been eating it since 1975....the sub sandwiches are awesome....the Hot Roast Beef sub is to die for...my other favorite is the Deluxe. Everything is always fresh. Wish they would open up in Mentor. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great food 98% of the time! Seriously, phenomenal when they're on point. But they DON'T DELIVER!"}
{"text":"Disappointing,  to say the least.   Every glass of water brought by the waitress had stuff floating in it.   She thought I should just drink it because she couldn't find a clean glass.  Had to pay for a bottled drink.  I was ready to leave at that point but was convinced to stay by the person I was with.  Service was slow, despite telling the waitress that we were on our lunch hours.  The salad was ok.  The pizza was disappointing,  too greasy and salty.  The food gave both of us indigestion.   Won't be returning."}
{"text":"What a find!  I was out that way for work last week and stopped in for lunch.  I had the chicken parm sandwich and a bowl of the tomato soup and they were both great.  My co-worker just got two pieces of pizza and a salad and he loved his lunch too.    The waitress, I think she said her name was Patty, treated everyone not only like family but like her own kids.  Sweet lady.    I even grabbed a box of cookies on the way out and my husband and kids crushed them.  I wish i could make a chocolate chip cookie like them.   Keep up the great work, and I can't wait to find myself in Wickliffe again!"}
{"text":"I stopped there on my way home to get two pieces of pizza. It was about two thirty and i think it was left over from earlier. It's usually better then that. I saw they're looking to hire. Maybe it wasn't as good because they are short of people."}
{"text":"I had the Super Delux hot sub with ham, salami, capicola, pepperoni & prosciutto.  Super nice waitress with a huge smile started things out beautifully.  Looking over the menu everything is priced under $10 except dinners and pizzas - my 12 inch sub was $6.99 and the 6 inch is $5.25.  Dis place da shizzola!  Super great sub on a delightfully light crunchy bread that was super satisfying.  Took half home for later.  Eyeballing the pizza and chicken parm for the next visit.   Beats the hell out of any subway 24/7 & 365  12 inch sub warm, coke and tax $9.05   NICE!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and everything was perfect!!! The Philly swisss sub was just warm enough with the perfect bread.  Meatballs and sauce to die for!!!! And of course cannolli for dessert......yummmies in the tummies"}
{"text":"Awsome!! Food is always good - taste and quality both. Service is always good because they are very well staffed ..... And every one is very friendly. I have had their pizza, sandwiches, salads.  Love'em all.  Yet to try their calzone. Portions are plentiful.  Nice family run place that makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Ok so fantastic pizza goes without saying, but I've now been here MANY times and can add more to that. Their salads OMG. First up: their Caesar salad. Another homemade dressing, and I am EXTREMELY picky about Caesar dressing. I find the bottled dressing to usually be bland and too mayo-ey. This is cheesy garlicky goodness. And the giant homemade croutons are delightful also.  Next up: the tuna chef salad. AMAZING. Perfect tuna salad with the perfect light touch of mayo on top of a bed of salad. I added a little of their house dressing and dear lord. So so good. Go here for the pizza, but grab a salad to go! Super super yum!"}
{"text":"I think the pizza is good, not great.  To me, sauce is king, and I feel the sauce is very run-of-the-Mill aside from heavy on the oregano.  The crust is nice and chewy. And I LOVE that you can order a mini size (4 slices).  My son said the Tiramisu was really good."}
{"text":"It's not pizza. It's a salty dough with whatever toppings your ordered. If you're a bread person, then this is up your alley. If you want anything with crunch or any kind of taste of marinara, well you are barking up the wrong tree I think.   Wings are good. Salad is good. Meet all sub is, like the pizza, doughy and lacking sauce and overly salty.  Where's the garlic?!    Such a shame..."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I am biased because I grew up eating this pizza because my father is Giuseppe! I also worked in this pizzeria all though adolescence. However, I have to say that this pizza is very unique compared to other Cleveland pizzerias. The pizza is a traditional Sicilian style square pan pizza, and it is absolutely delicious! Don't expect anything fancy or gourmet, just fantastic pizza. I grew up on the East side, but now that I am a West sider, everyone raves about Angelo's pizza. I have tried it. I eat all kinds of pizza -- I just love pizza! Honestly, I personally don't think Angelo's compares! I won't go further due to my own conflict of interest, but you should try it and decide for yourself. My other favorite pizza places in Cleveland include Valentino's in Little Italy & Geraci's in University Heights."}
{"text":"Had their Super Deluxe sub - a fancy italian sub. Got a Large for about 7 bucks and it was huge and delicious. They added banana peppers for me with no trouble at all and the waitress was nice, especially given we sprung a fairly large group on her lat minute (about 12 of us) during the lunch hour!  The sub was good - I ate half for lunch and had the other half for dinner. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their food - my cohort had the chocolate canoli and she said it was excellent.  Good prices and good food, along with good service - not bad at all! I'm in town for work - and will likely come back before the end of my trip, if not, the next time I am here!"}
{"text":"When we need a sheet pizza for a last minute party we know who to call. The price is right and the pizza is perfect. The salads have a lettuce overload thing going on and not worth it. Every once and a while we will order a sub but it isn't a favorite. It's almost like you aren't sure if you like them and want to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Can't find too many family run gems these days...this place is legit!  Always greeted with a smile walking up to the counter.  I go every chance I get when home visiting family.  HUGE fan of the pepperoni rolls and the sicilian style pizza.  Good crunch on the crust; I always see a huge dough operation going on in the back when I stop in to pick up my pizza, these guys take pride in their product!  I used Guiseppe's catering for a high school class reunion, not only was the food delicious, the per/person portions were perfect and we had just enough left for a couple of us to steal a few slices for later:)   I'll be a die hard fan for years!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for delicious pizza with an excellent crust, this is your place!  Whether it's a pizza, calzone, a sub, or wings, there is no such thing as a bad selection at Giuseppes!  Buon appeitito!"}
{"text":"Seriously worth the little extra for this delicious pizza! I'd take it over Cleveland pizza co any day!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this pizza! It is a very different style than any other pizzas in the area and it has pretty good prices. It is definitely not the same style as a regular pizza that most places have but that's what I really like about it. It's super cheesy and greasy and the sauce is sweeter. It is definitely unlike anything else and I really enjoy it."}
{"text":"I've said before that if I ever moved far away from home, Giuseppe's would be one of the only things I would truly miss and I still believe that. Their pizza is incredible! Something about the combination of the cheese they use and their amazingly good sauce tastes like heaven on earth. The crust is crispy around the edges, but soft where it matters and I love that it's square shaped, very unique. I've been getting just their plain cheese pizza for years and I actually have no desire to add any toppings because it's so good just the way it is.  The service is great and everyone is very friendly there. They save your number so they know you by name if you've ordered before. The only downside is they don't deliver, but luckily I live close by. They have also recently remodeled the place and it looks awesome and really modern now! Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"The short and sweet version: This place makes a delicious bakery-style, pie. You know, the rectangle pan kind? Yep--it's damn good.  The long version: We ordered a sheet pizza here for the mini's birthday party. We were hosting the bash at Lost Nation Sports Park and this spot was the highest rated, nearest pizza place (according to Yelp, of course.) After reading the positive reviews, we decided to give it a shot--because really, how picky are kids about pizza?? (The answer: They aren't--especially 9 year old boys.)   Well, the boys devoured this huge pie--some even came back for seconds! When they had all moved on to birthday activities, there were just a couple of small pieces left, so I snagged one. Yum! Normally I do not like bakery-style pizza. I'm a crunchy/chewy crust kinda gal and a fluffy, bready pie just ain't my thing. But this particular one was extra delicious. I don't know if it was the sauce, the cheese or the bread, but the flavor was just there. Come to think of it, it really had to be the sauce, since it was just cheese pizza. It did have a bit of that breadiness, but really not too much. It was matched perfectly with the punch of the sauce balancing it together.   I'm not sure what it cost us, so I can't comment on price, but I would definitely return if I was in the area! Perfectly for kids and adults alike!"}
{"text":"We have tried a few different pizza places in the Willowick area and this is our favorite by far.  Their pizza sizes are a bit off from what you'd expect...we ordered a large and the box looked like a small but somehow it was enough to feed 4 people.  They cut their pizza in little squares like Donatos does.  Their cheese is amazing!!  I grew up in an Italian town that is known for good pizza and although this isn't the best I've had, it's the best I've had around here.  Try it :)"}
{"text":"Definitely 5 stars for their pizza. Omg the white pizza was so damn delicious. And unfortunately for my ass, I ate about 2/3 of the sheet pizza for my birthday. #worthit  I'm giving it 4 stars for their wings. They were meaty and had a good flavor. Too bad I ate so much pizza that I couldn't make room for more.  Unfortunately, I'm giving the subs just 2 stars. The bread was bland and there were no sauces or dressing on any of the subs (we got 2 platters). They didn't come with any condiments on the side either. I would not come back here for the subs.  I can't comment on the dining area, other than I know it is small. We ordered everything in bulk for a party. Everything on the order was correct and ready at the correct pickup time."}
{"text":"\"How come ya ain't got no brothas up on the wall\"--Buggin' Out  Insert a name that ends in a vowel.  Insert a \"family history\" story on packaging and/or website.  Insert some dude in a track suit and pinky ring sitting in the corner.  Insert bottles of stagnant olive oil in decorative bottles on shelves and you have basically every Italian place on Clevelands East Side.  To me, they are all the same.  Good, but nothing too exotic.  From what I remember they eat a lot more seafood in Italy.  Here its pasta, bread, red sauce, covered in cheese.  Mix and match how you wish. Here we have gotten pizza, subs and salads.  All have been fresh and OK.  Pizza has been better in past times than this time.  Girls working the counter are always super nice and friendly.  They serve beer too which is cool.  I think they serve wine but I cant drink wine without feeling like a putz.  They also serve Peroni...which is the Italian version of cat piss.    Bacco, tabacco e Venere riducono l'uomo in cenere!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this little restaurant. We walked in and were greeted immediately. They tell you to grab a seat anywhere which I enjoy being able to find our own little corner. This seats were all almost full as it was lunch time but we were able to grab a seat. We were greeted shortly after sitting and asked what we would like to drink. They don't have much with free re rills, only water and tea. So it was bottled lemonade and fruit punch. We split some garlic bread with cheese and marina. My girlfriend had a calzone and I enjoyed the dozen wings. The bread of the calzone was cooked a little hard but it was delicious. The prices were very fair as well and the waitress was very friendly and helpful. I would eat here again for lunch if I came back into town."}
{"text":"Best meatball sandwich in over 30 years! Service is exemplary.  All 3 of us were delighted with our meals."}
{"text":"I was here for work related training and this place wasn't too far away from us so decided to check it out. There was nine of us on separate checks (I know, how annoying) and the waitress didn't blink or bring us any less great service.   I had the calzone with diced tomatoes, onions & sausage in addition to the automatic cheeses & sauce. Cooked to perfection with tasty breading and...well, while it was big  I wish it was bigger just because it was SO freaking good. And when I paid my tab, those cookies in my face could not be resisted.   Also, none of my other dining compatriots were let down either.   Overall, a freaking tasty place to eat."}
{"text":"Never have I had such amazing customer service. Alyssa was fantastic and I absolutely will be going back sooner than later."}
{"text":"Pizza is wonderful and it's so thick and cheesy - the sausage they use for the pizza is one of my favorites because it's the big slices instead of the little bite size pieces.  The staff is friendly and very helpful- the pizza is very good and they have a sit down little spot to enjoy your pizza with some wine or you can grab it to go :) either way it's a good choice"}
{"text":"Aye here last weekend I have nothing but good things to say. I was a little misled because driving by it looks more like a dine in restaurant, but once inside it seemed like more of a take out joint, but it was still delicious! They do have a small dining room and it might have been since we got there around 8 but the dining area was empty. Even though the restaurant was empty it was a revolving door of take out orders and we understood why. We ordered cheesy garlic bread, it was great. It was the first time I've seen my 9 mo old get all the pieces in his mouth and none on the floor. I ordered a g'zone with (my choice toppings) sausage, onions, and mushrooms. It was great but I wasn't a fan of how crispy it was but it was still phenomenal! The marinara sauce made it! So good. My husband ordered the meat lovers. They were out of smalls so they upgraded it to a large at the small price, really that wasn't necessary we would have paid the difference but we appreciated it, thanks! :) Lastly, I got some Tiramisu to go, my absolute favorite dessert. It was just as amazing as everything else. Cannot wait to go back or order out, since that seemed like the thing to do."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with the family.  The food arrived in a timely manner and was excellent!  My daughter had ravioli.  Compared to the meal she had in Little Italy....twice the amount for $4.00 less.  My wife and I both had subs.  She had the Philly Cheese Steak and I had the Roast Beef.  Both were fantastic!!!!  And we're. It very expensive!  Definitely a place we may visit again before we leave!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious food. Had the meatball and was not disappointed. Very friendly staff. Felt extremely homely."}
{"text":"So good. Got the fried ravioli and they were so fresh! I have never had them this fresh! They were filled with such fresh cheese- I think ricotta. SOOO GOOD. We also got a small cheese pizza that was square cut and cooked to perfection! The crust was so flaky and cheese so fresh. We have now found our favorite pizza place in ohio."}
