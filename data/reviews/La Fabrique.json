{"text":"Braised beef with gnocchi in a vegetable ragu. Pillowy soft nuggets of flour and potato dumplings, gnocchi isn't my thing and thus, my boat remains unfloated. Don't get me wrong, the dish was tasty - the beef was tender and broke at the slightest pressure from the fork and lent a nice beefy aroma to the sauce of eggplant and carrots and gnocchi."}
{"text":"I was unimpressed with the food and the service was pretty poor.  I don't intend to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Ate at the Annexe that they have open for the summer, just a couple doors up from the regular location on St.Denis. I have been meaning to eat at this place for a while now, and I am happy that I finally did. Sat out on the terrace with my brother and enjoyed a very nice late lunch/early dinner. 

We started our meal with some delicious bloody caesars that had some port in them and were garnished with anchovy stuffed olives (yum!). Could have been a tad spicier, but other than that they were really quite good.

For appetizers, I ordered the melon salad, upon the recommendation of our server and I was not disappointed! It was really refreshing on a very humid day. my brother ordered the tartine gratine, but was brought the cheese fondue. It was not what he ordered, but we didn't complain because the cheese fondue was really great! It's a deliciously breaded piece of cheese on top of a little rocket salad. 

We completed our meal with a second round of caesars and our main dishes: the bavette for my brother, and the gnocchi with a scallop for me. Both were well seasoned and cooked perfectly. We also ordered a beef burger to bring home to my sweetie who didn't come for lunch. It's made with braised beef and garnished with a sweet red cabbage. Really yummy! 

Overall a lovely meal. Delicious food, nice atmosphere, and beautiful plating. The bread and home made chivey butter that came with the meal was really great and their home made ketchup and mayo were also delicious!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went there for Montreal table. Foods I had there were oily and salty to me. It would be better if I had a glass of wine. I only liked dessert there after eating the foods and the presentation. The presentation was amazing. Staffs there kind and friendly. 

Also I recommend to seat far from open kitchen to some people who just like me. I seated next to the open kitchen I was too warm and I felt that the air wasn't fresh. My clothes smells like a restaurant."}
{"text":"Hip spot for a younger crowd. No problem getting a reservation a week in advance for a Friday night; the place was busy but not full . while we were there. 

Loved the gratis homemade pickles with peasant bread and chive/shallot spread. Fois gras app also successful. Avoid veal cheek main -- the Asian-style sauce was too bitter. Steak frites was better and cooked as ordered but is the most expensive menu item. Iced tea came straight from a can. 

Service could have been more attentive but we never felt rushed. Not a bad meal but not a destination either."}
{"text":"This place is actually really cool and awesome on the tastebuds. 

Pros

 - Entirely different breakfast from the staple eggs and bacon
 - Food is super
 - love the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant 
 - Drip coffee is great!
 - Super friendly service 
 - Clean modern establishment 
 - reasonable on the wallet

Con

- none to speak of

Really overall a great place!"}
{"text":"We were here for brunch on Sun., March 20 - our first and only time I might add.... This place has the kitchen right in the midst of the tables so customers can watch as the food is prepared. It's a fun idea & I liked it at first, but I was facing one food preparer (a young, short wiry guy) preparing tartar. He spooned the tartar from a bowl into a mold & with the same spoon, scraped out the remaining tartar from the bowl into his mouth & then placed the same spoon in a metal container with water. He re-used the same spoons from that metal container (without washing the spoons or the small rinse container) & repeated this same behaviour- using this spoon to eat the remaining bits of tartar from the bowl - several times throughout the hour & a half that we were there..... Yikes! Fortunately I did not order tartar - but I found his food preparation techniques alarming to say the least..... Looks like some re-training might be in order......"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner while on vacation in Montreal after checking out the thoughtful menu online.  When we arrived, I immediately knew I'd come to the right place.  It was open, decorated with some awesome artwork and right in the middle is an open kitchen where you can see the chefs move swiftly and expertly while preparing your meals!

Our server was absolutely lovely, explaining everything on the menu with expertise.  She made some cocktail recommendations (a gin fizz, made with a small batch gin from Vermont, tasting of honey) and she was spot on.  It was a nice touch that she brought extra soda water to the table so I could alter the cocktail to fit my tastes, but it didn't need altering at all.

After ordering, the complimentary pickles and bread came to the table.  I don't think people have said enough about these pickles on their reviews.  These pickles are insanely good- they're bread and butter pickles with a gingery kick, absolute perfection.  Other places would charge you an arm and a leg for these on a charcuterie board- I thought it was a great touch.

My partner ordered the steak frites and I had the hake with ravioli in a mushroom broth.  We were both really pleased with our meals.  He loved the butter and steak (perfectly cooked to medium-rare and tender) and my dish was so delicious.  The mushroom broth was richly flavoured, the hake light and a great contrast to the richness of the broth, and large, thin slices of pickled carrot provided acidity as well.  A really thoughtful dish.  After a lovely dessert of lemon merengue tart, the waitress brought out a small glass of cotton candy to top off the meal.  It was a playful, light touch to end a great dining experience.  I'm sad I'll only be able to go back on vacation- I am already craving those pickles!"}
{"text":"Le feuilleté de tartare fut une excellente entrée, mais les gnocchi aux escargots ont vraiment déçu: comparés à tout le reste du plat, les escargots étaient totalement sans goût et sans texture. Le format de portion de ce plat laissait également à désirer, compte tenue du prix et de \"l'absence\" des escargots. 
 La tarte aux citron fut à mon goût, mais elle est très citronnée, au point de déplaire aux autre membres de la tablée qui l ont également essayée. 

Le serveur, bien que sympathique, n'était pas aux fait des plats du jours ni de la conception des plats réguliers. En plus il nous oubliait constamment."}
{"text":"Just went there for brunch. I loved it! The food was delicious and the service is flawless. Will definitely go there again, and not just one more time!"}
{"text":"La Fabrique's open kitchen takes up the center of the restaurant.  The place says trendy all the way, but deservedly so.  The service staff are young, energetic, and helpful and the customers appear to be on the younger side as well.   The food was great and we had brunch with a Quebecois twist.   I had the salmon tartar with the poach egg on toast on top.  I thought it was a great variation on dishes I had before, but never put together in this way.   My daughter had the pancakes with chocolate sauce that were also something very different if you are use to brunch in the USA.  We also had a pate of pork with pickles of the house, which was a nice touch.  They bring you a jar of pickles/cornichon to serve yourself."}
{"text":"This terrace brunch is everything you want from a terrace brunch! Sipping on grapefruit cider mimosa, drinking coffee from little glasses (what's with Montreal and serving coffee in glasses?), and taking bites of delicious food that combine taste, texture and aroma. 

I got the mushroom tart. The description said braised beef. I was expecting something like a quiche with a bowl of braised beef and somewhere a fried egg, perhaps. What I got was nothing like that! On top of a thick hummus-like bean paste that was drizzled with olive oil, sat a small disc of thin-layered pastry, filled with  think later of mushroom, atop which sat two discs of super tender braised beef, and everything was topped with a fried egg. there were chunks of tomatoes sprinkled with a really tasty salt positioned under the pile, stuck into the bean paste or on the plate displayed to the world. Every bite, whether it's just one of the ingredients or a combination, was very flavorful. I took a long time to finish my meal and it was well worth it.

My brunch buddy got a plate of bean stew, topped with fennel, ricotta, potatoes, and 63-degree eggs. Doesn't sound like much, but it was really really good! 

Definitely a good location to venture out to if you are in the city. Everything on the menu looked awesome! Try a few!"}

{"text":"PIRE EXPÉRIENCE DE MA VIE... 
Par un belle matinée pluvieuse d'automne, je me présente à ce restaurant pour le brunch... Amateure de ce petit péché de la fin de semaine, j'ai eu la chance d'essayer la plupart des restaurants qui les offrent à Montréal et la Fabrique était un des restaurants que je n'avais pas encore essayé... Et bien je peux vous dire que je me serais bien passé de cette expérience... 

À mon arrivée, une gentille serveuse vient me voir pour me demander si j'ai un réservation et pour combien de personne.  Je lui réponds que je n'ai pas de réservation et que je suis seule.  Elle m'indique qu'il y aura donc de la place au bar pour moi... Je lui demande si par hasard la table qui est entrain de se libérer près de nous, serait disponible à la place du bar, ce à quoi elle me réponds oui mais qu'elle va quand même vérifier avec sa placeuse... Entre-temps, je paie mon parcomètre car elle m'a déjà confirmé qu'il y avait de la place au bar, quoi qu'il arrive... Mais quel ne fut pas ma surprise lorsqu'elle revient pour me dire que finalement, il n'y a pas de place avant 30 minutes!  Surprise, déçue, j'accepte mais j'essaie quand même de la questionner pourquoi il y a quelques minutes il y avait de la place au bar et soudainement, rien avant 30minutes... De plus, une autre dame apparaît et lui chuchote à voix base de dire à la dame que c'est complet!  Ce qu'elle fait en se tournant et en m'indiquant que finalement, c'est complet pour le moment pas de place avant une heure!  Rendu là je suis embêté et surprise car en l'espace de 5min, je suis passé des réponses: oui, il y a de la place au bar, quelques minutes plus tard, oui dans 5min, ensuite oui dans 30min et finalement, non seulement dans 1 heure donc trouvez une alternative!  (il faut que je mentionne que je suis la première en ligne)  Je demande donc à la nouvelle actrice dans la situation, s'il serait possible pour moi d'attendre dans le resto et si jamais quelqu'un part plus rapidement d'avoir une table... (Honnêtement, depuis le début, elle n'avait pas l'air de vouloir m'avoir comme client quoiqu'il arrive... )  

Donc elle commence à me dire \"cela ne sera probablement pas avant 1hre, vous pourriez essayer d'autres restaurants aux alentours \", ce à quoi je finis pas répondre, sur le ton de quelqu'un déçu: \" ben ok, mettez-moi sur votre liste pour 13h! (soit dans une heure)\".  Sortant de nul part, elle me rétorque \"avec votre attitude, je ne sais pas si vous voulez vraiment manger ici\". QUOI!  Je la regarde stupéfaite de sa réaction et dans mon incompréhension je lui dis: \" Je me suis déplacé jusqu'à votre restaurant pour bruncher.  Dû aux informations contradictoires sur la disponibilité, j'ai même payé le stationnement pour finalement me faire dire qu'il n'y a pas de place.  Et que malgré le fait que j'accepte d'attendre 1hr sur place, vous m'accusez de mauvaise attitude!  Je crois que j'ai manqué la partie où elle a oublié d'indiquer qu'elle s'était levé du mauvais pied ou que son succès lui est monté à la tête!  En aucun cas ai-je monté le ton de voix ou utilisé un langage désobligeant pour qu'elle est une réaction pareille!  De plus, j'étais même assez enthousiaste d'essayer le restaurant, que j'ai accepté d'attendre une heure mais pour des raisons que je ne peux expliquer, elle m'indique que ma présence à son restaurant la laisse FROIDE!  

Je m'excuse mais son comportement a été inacceptable!  Le service à la clientèle est une partie importante de l'expérience à un restaurant et elle a lamentablement échoué ce critère... Un client déçu d'une situation malencontreuse, créée par votre manque de communication entre votre personnel, réagira probablement de façon impatiente mais si cela est de façon respectueuse, rien ne justifie une réaction odieuse et condescendante sous prétexte qu'elle peut se le permettre car c'est SON restaurant!  Au contraire, elle devrait être plus à l'écoute de sa clientèle!  

Pour moi, l'égo n'a pas de place dans la gestion d'un restaurant!  C'est désolant car je voulais aussi essayer sa patisserie Rhubarbe mais grâce à cette expérience, elle m'a fait économisé le temps, déplacement et argent.

P.s.: j'ai oublié de mentionné comme point positif qu'elle m'a remboursé les frais du parcomètre!"}
{"text":"J'y suis allée pour le brunch et j'ai adoré. 

La cuisine est entièrement ouverte et directement au centre du restaurant. Lorsqu'on attend pour sa table, c'est devant la passe qu'on le fait alors on voit tout les plats défiler. Ça ouvre l'appétit et nous donne une idée de ce qu'on a envie de manger.

Le menu brunch change assez régulièrement et tout dessus a l'air délicieux. Le pain brioché avec purée de courge, sirop d'érable et porc est un must si vous avez la chance de le voir sur le menu. 

Le yaourt maison accompagné de caramel est un bel à côté. 

Les jus d'orange fraîchement pressés sont plus grands que dans grands nombre de restaurants.

Le service est souriant et très chaleureux."}
{"text":"La Fabrique was our last meal in Montreal and we were happy we chose to eat there. The food was delicious and the chefs did a wonderful job with the presentation of it. The atmosphere was relaxed with cool music and the waitress Roxane was amazing! She was genuine, funny and truly took care of us. All in all - La Fabrique was the entire package."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a nice meal. It was recommended by my beau-frere. The ambience was really nice. Not too crowded (meaning the tables and seats were not flush against each other). I really liked the open kitchen because I like watching how food is prepared. It is kind of like watching a tv show live in a studio. We started with a potato salad, but it was no ordinary potato salad. The flavour was there, and the potatoes were not over or under cooked. The nice touch was the addition of mussels. For the main, we shared the salmon and the cauliflower, broccoli, Brussell sprout sauté. Both were delicious. The salmon was cooked to perfection (I find that most restaurants over cook their salmon so it is really dry). All I can say is that the chefs know how to prepare their dishes. Their homemade pickles were good too."}
{"text":"Tableside cooking? Check. Local ingredients? Check. Service that is genuinely kind, efficient and hospitable? Check. A restaurant that makes its own mayo and ketchup? Wow. The warm, charred bread and sour cream butter spread was a nice way to start the meal. Housemade pickles added to the wow factor. We started with the daily soup, an amazing Carrot, clementine puree. We continued with a cheese terrine melted on a slab of crusty bread. For entrées I had the succulent beef shoulder braised and grilled, dressed with Roman beans. It was out of this world good. My husband had the salmon with a side of fries. We finished with the french toast and I highly suggest that you save room for it too. The insanely delicious caramel top was a perfect balance for the salted, buttery crust of the soft bread. We were so disappointed that we couldn't go back for a second night as they do close on Mondays, but we were glad to have had the experience for at least one of our culinary adventures in Montreal."}
{"text":"Horrible service, mediocre food.  

You can do far better than this place.   When our meal was served, they neglected to see if all the diners had tableware, and we were left sitting on the terrace for five minutes until I walked into the restaurant  and asked for a knife and a fork.  We also ordered a second bottle of wine at the time the main course was served, and were promptly ignored.  The wine came as we were finishing our food.  The service at McDonald's is far better than this place."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I have ever had. Had the pulled pork on English muffin topped with cranberry bread and a soft boiled egg. Fries in duck fat. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Pour un mercredi soir, le restaurant était pas mal rempli et il n'y avait que deux serveurs. Alors, ils ont dû prendre un peu de temps avant de nous remettre le menu, servir l'eau et le pain. Une fois la commade placée, le service pour le reste est correct. 

Nous avons pris une entrée de salade Boston et le fromage fondu avec prosciutto sur pain. Les deux sont bons, malgré que fromage est un peu lourd. J'aime bien le cornichon fait maison qui accompagnait le pain aussi. 

Le spécial du jour était la joue de veau servi avec des pâtes et chou frisé frit. La viande était très tendre. J'ajouterai un peu plus d'assaisonnement pour soulever le goût par contre. 

Nous avons également commande un ravioli au fois gras avec choux de bruxelles. J'aime bien lengoût citronné qui venait enlever le goût graisseux du foie gras. C'est une bonne combinaison. 

Bon restaurant."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant experience, a super friendly staff in a beautiful industrial decor.  The open kitchen gives the whole place a special touch.

But above all a stunning food, there are always new items on the menu that keep surprising us. A must try in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Muy Favorite restaurant in Montreal.
Clearly, no doubt on that - the best brunch on sunday.
Unique, magic, innovative, and just great.

Quality food, super service.
Nice wine, nice ambiance.
Best place to have dinner between friends.

Go! Go!"}
{"text":"This turned out to be an excellent recommendation from another restaurant. Mr favorite was the French toast, which, although the garnishes change on a weekly basis, is a staple- so crunchy outside, yet so fluffy inside. Ask for the bacon to be slightly crispy/ charred and you e won't be disappointed at all! Oh, and tell Stephanie the girls from NYC said you had to have a pickleback made with the juice from their homemade pickles- amazeballs!"}
{"text":"Malgré une déco sympa, un concept de cuisine ouverte, c'est trop cher pour une cuisine aussi simple, mais tout de même bonne. Nous avons eu un serveur débutant mais tout de même sympa. J'y retournerais pour ressayer et peux être changer d'avis"}
{"text":"First thing's first: walking into the restaurant, the first thing you see is the open kitchen and the food waiting on the pass under heat lamps. Interesting introduction as you walk in, but unfortunately your first contact is wading through \"traffic\". And though the service is a little slow, the food is quite outstanding. The complimentary pickle jar to start and cotton candy at the end are nice touches, and does nothing to take away from the artful dishes prepared before your eyes by the creative chefs (who are not hard on the eyes themselves). 
Tried the salmon tartar which was which was fresh and flavorful and the \"plat du jour\" which consisted of a pork and black bean tart which scallops and seasonal veggies - amazing. Didn't have room for dessert but apparently the Pain Perdu is wonderful.
Will definitely go back (but maybe during the week)"}
{"text":"RUSTIC SETTING, VERY FRIENDLY SERVERS & AWESOMEEEE FOOD!

One of my friend, who is a big fan of this place, dragged us to La Fabrique for brunch. First let me say that their kitchen is fabulous. They have it out in the open where you can actually watch what they are cooking and how. Second important thing is, they now have their menu is english and we went the day they started using those menu so we were even able to point out the mistakes. The server was very polite and friendly and explained us all about the dishes. 

DRINKS: We ordered coffee, orange juice and chai tea latte for start of the meal. The coffee is being served in small glasses that are used in India for tea serving and I was very pleased with that and above all the coffee was brewed perfectly. Chai tea on other hand was very light and I would have loved if they would have served 2 tea bags instead of just one. Juice was freshly squeezed and perfect.  

FOOD: I ordered FRENCH TOAST with English custard, apple and maple glaze. I had to wait for a while but OMG it was well worth the wait. It was very unique because I had never had a french toast baked in the cute little casserole. It felt like my taste buds thanking me. I have never had such a delicious french toast in my entire life. The top layer was all caramelized maple, then English custard and french toast and caramelized apple then french toast again and bottom most layer was English custard. I could eat that over and over and would still want it. My friend had the English biscuit with pulled pork topped with egg. The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The biscuit was very flaky and to top that off the egg was soo gooey in the center. He loved it. My husband ordered pork roast with salad and he was impressed with that. 

Overall, the food was really good and I would definitely wanna go back there and try their pancakes. Ohhh, I can't stop drooling! I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"The French toast was fucking textbook. Props to Brian T for discovering a breakfast whiskey!"}
{"text":"Cutest little restaurant. The kitchen is right in the center so you can watch your food being made. The service was fast and great. The salmon was delicious. I normally like mine well done and I asked them to cook it a little longer and they were so accommodating which was nice. The beef shoulder was also very good. If you are new to town or a local you should check this place out. I was very pleased and it was reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"The best French brunch Cuisine experience ever! We paid for the set menu Easter Brunch and it was worth every bite! 

They space out the courses nicely to give you time and enjoy what you are eating. The positions are perfect to keep you satisfied but not overly full. 

The staff is friendly and the place has a homey feel to it. 

Their lattes are amazing!!!! They do order two sizes (small / large). Get the large because the small is not worth it and you will be wanting more. Lol 

Overall - great experience and we would return without a doubt!"}
{"text":"The location is nice and the setup is good, but the food and the service are not on par. 

I started with the Porc Terrine which unfortunately was tasteless and dry (although the portion was more than generous). The accompanying foie gras was nice. So were the starters of my wife and her mother. 

The main course was more miss than hit. My duck burger was OK but they definitely tried to cram to many things in it which made the whole thing unpalatable. The duck is mixed with cheese then crusted and deep-fried. Then it's put in between buns with some sort of celeri/beets salad, something resembling a bearnaise sauce and foie gras (that was a supplement that I asked for). Unfortunately the dish was way to heavy and the sauce was too strong. Something that could have been really inventive turned out to be a greasy deluxe version of a McDonald dish. 

My wife ordered the old-aged steack. She asked for it medium-rare and it came well done. Now that's bad. When a restaurant can not cook meat properly, you know for a fact there is something really wrong in the kitchen. They were honests with us and did not count the dish on the note but the damage was done. 

The deserts were OK although I am 90% sure their creme brulee was not homemade. 

Service was decent. The only problem was that out of the 3 waiters (2 girls and one guy), only the girls looked like they knew what they were doing. The guy kept forgetting everything and did not look like a professional waiter at all (he probably gave these poor girls more work than help at the end). 

So all in all, a below average experience which is all the most disappointing that some of the ideas on the menu or in the setup could have led to something really great. 

If you know cooking, don't go there, if you're just looking for a nice place and don't care about what you eat, this could do the trick."}
{"text":"Pour moi un des meilleurs restaurants de Montréal. Une équilibre parfait par sa modestie malgré sa recherche. Des plats raffinés et une quantité suffisante. La cuisson est parfaitement maîtrisée ainsi que l'équilibre des saveurs dans chaque plat. Les serveurs et cuisiniers sont disponibles et ouverts à la discussion sans pour autant être trop présents. Tous les plats sont bons (j'en suis certain!). Le prix est le bon.

Que dire de plus..."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!! Farm to table so it is extremely fresh.  If you are looking for gluten & lactose free, this is the perfect place.  I ate the green salad, steak and French fries fried in duck fat.  My husband ordered the vegetables with his steak and we shared.  Every morsel we ate was delicious!!  We happened upon this place because the restaurant with the pig head was booked solid & sometimes things happen for a reason.  DELICIOUS & very friendly waitstaff.  Don't think twice unless you need Internet with your meal because the wifi was spotty & did not work well."}
{"text":"After walking up and down Rue St. Denis, I chose La Fabrique because it seemed like a local place and the food looked good from the window.  Menus are available in French and English.  Selections were innovative, including one allowing the chef to make something of his whim.  I had a hard time deciding on several possibilities, but was happy with my choice of beef with scallops, herb gnocchi, some perfectly cooked zucchini strips and olives in a well flavored sauce. What was nice about the restaurant was the complimentary special touches, like the warm toasted peasant bread with chive spread, large jar of delicious homemade pickles, and even pink cotton candy for a special ending.  Although my entree was more than enough for me, I wanted to try the french fries fried in duck fat.  The waiter accommodated by giving me a small sample in a little container.  Absolutely decadent!"}
{"text":"Première expérience personnelle concluante! Tout y était délicieux, de l'entrée au dessert. Quelques petits bémols cependant. Le service quoique sympathique était un peu déficient. Il semble y avoir eut quelques ratés pour certains plats à notre table."}
{"text":"Eating here was a religious experience. Duck fat potatoes. Red meat cooked to perfection. Transformative. Ethereal. I almost cried twice. Wow. What a meal."}
{"text":"My colleague and I landed in Montreal late in the evening and happened to find La Fabrique by chance as we hangrily walking around in search of food. 

The menu was quite extensive and options were interesting. She chose the linguini (+1 scallop)  and I went for the pulled pork burger. I was surprised that the pulled pork was pressed into a tight patty! Was fully expecting the pulled pork to be strewn out and that I would have a messy night. The meat was tender and juicy. I really enjoyed the flavours! It was paired with duck fat fries with homemade ketchup. All excellent! We tried each other's dishes and both agreed that my burger was the better of the 2. My colleague mentioned that her linguini was lacklustre and was a little too heavy on a vinaigrette taste. Bonus: they serve you pickles and bread as a a free appetizer and cotton candy as a free dessert! 

Space set-up was interesting with an open concept kitchen right in the middle of the room. Our server was attentive and polite but a little slow (note that he was also the only server that night and there were approximately 5 tables)."}
{"text":"Nous y avons été pour un brunch un dimanche et avons été un peu déçus. Déjà, le service était particulièrement long, que ce soit pour commander et aussi à attendre nos plats et nos factures.
Les plats étaient particulièrement peu copieux, surtout certains comme le Bretzel avec saumon et avocat, qui a l'air d'une entrée à 15$.
Les plats étaient bons ceci dit, mais entre le service moyen et le manque de générosité des plats, nous avons clairement été déçus et ne pensons pas y retourner :( dommage"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is just another hipster joint. The menu sounds tasty and the atmosphere is trendy, but the dishes are mediocre and plain. Montreal is cracking with top notch restaurants pushing the envelope when it comes to trends and creating flavourful dishes, La Fabrique is underwhelming and was obviously a disappointment. Staff was great, however."}
{"text":"The relaxed environment of La Fabrique Bistrot made it the perfect place for dinner following a long day of travel and business meetings. Starting with an excellent wine recommendation, our waiter continually demonstrated an expertise and attention to detail that made for a casual and professionally-productive time, all while adroitly switching between English and French in order to accommodate all four members of our dinner party.

After spending a great deal of time scrutinizing the menu and its occasional, though rather amusing, translation failures, I decided that a hearty bowl of onion soup was an apropos way to begin the meal in a city still under the grip of winter. The robustly-flavored and appropriately-comforting soup proved the perfect way to start the meal.

For my main and final course, I opted for the pan-seared cod with cumin and black olive mashed potato galette. The obviously high-quality fish was seared perfectly, the light char serving to hold together the flaky flesh without overwhelming its mild flavor. The boldly-flavored potato \"cake\" proved a welcome and pleasing juxtaposition to the cod, making for an  adeptly-balanced dish. The accompanying vegetables added a bit of depth to the dish without disturbing the pairing of fish and galette that was clearly the chef's focus.

After lingering for a few hours all while never feeling rushed despite the rapidly-filling dining room, we departed having enjoyed a meal clearly prepared by a skilled and passionate chef intent on providing rich, satisfying \"comfort\" food in a laid-back environment."}
{"text":"This place was great. After walking around with empty stomachs, we were enticed by the island kitchen.

The veal cheek is out of this world with a nice medium body bottle of wine.
i have to say this place was far more enojyable than some of the other more fancier places i have been. This place is a must."}
{"text":"We have been La Fabrique once in 2012 and once 2013 while visiting Montreal for a long weekend.  Both times the service was excellent and the food was amazing.  

The most recent time we were there we stuck with a combination of small plates.  They start with bread and their own pickles.  I don't know what it is with those pickles, but it's hard to stop eating them.  The beet/cheddar/pear salad was right on the point.  We also had the mi-figue and the potato apple gnocchi as well as the foie gras torchon.  They were all excellent.  I would definitely recommend something that involves foie gras.

I used to be a vegetarian, so I tend to take a look at the menu with a vegetarian's eye.  I think a vegetarian could also have an amazing meal here.

Staff was very friendly and attentive without crowding us."}
{"text":"Voilà un bon resto à découvrir à deux ou plus. Je vous conseille même plus car quand la Fabrique c'est plus une ambiance de copains que d'amoureux. Attention, hein, le décor est tout de même très classe, inspiré comme son nom l'indique, d'un atmosphère d'usine. J'aime particulièrement les immenses tables hautes en bois autour desquelles on peut tenir à une dizaine. En plus comme elles sont carré, tout le monde est à portée de voix. Pratique et convivial donc.
Côté bouffe, je dirai : Wahou! Et encore : Oh la vache! Eh oui! Voilà des plats qui sortent de l'ordinaire! Il y a une vraie recherche culinaire dans la confection des repas et ça fait plaisir d'aller au resto pour enfin manger quelque chose de bon et de nouveau! Et en plus le menu change régulièrement! De quoi revenir fréquemment histoire de tester les nouveautés!
Seul bémol pour moi, le cuistot à la main lourde sur l'huile... Attention à ce que vous choisissez!"}
{"text":"WOW.
C'est un des meilleurs restaurants à Montréal j'ai le goût de dire après ma soirée là-bas hier soir. Ok, ça m'a coûté un bon 150$ pour souper avec ma blonde, surtout avec le fait qu'on ne peut pas apporter notre vin. 

L'ambience est vraiment super, c'est un peu comfort food tout en étant classe. Le service est très bon aussi. Fait à noter: Un pot de cornichons est amené à la table en plus du pain eheh.

Le menu est tout simplement débile. Il faut commencer par une soupe au pichet. Ne pas remplir son bol au complet pour en garder plus pour le lendemain.
Ensuite, au niveau de l'entrée, nous avons pris un fromage coulant. C'est du fromage chaud qui coule sur une toast qui a été servi avec une bonne salade à l'ail.

Plat principal : J'ai pris la je-ne-me-rappelle-plus-le-nom qui était du veau avec des tranches de patates dans une sauce à la crême. WOW. Ma blonde a pris le plat du moment qui était du risotto aux artichauts avec du poisson. WOW."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est vraiment sympa et pas besoin d'y allé tard pour qu'il y ait du monde. Le staff est hyper attentionné. Côté bouffe, la salade de betterave, chèvre et proscuito est sublime de même que le pavé de colin et risotto. Belle place pour un souper de soir de semaine."}
{"text":"Nous sommes aller à la Fabrique dans le cadre d'un brunch avec des amis.

Ce brunch est très bien situé.

Pour ma part j'ai prit le pancake (qui ressemblait plus à des muffins) avec purée de pomme, cheddar, uf mollet et sirop d'érable avec un supplément bacon à 3$. Dommage que s'est été que 2 toutes petites tranches pour ce prix là.
Ce plat était très copieux sinon dans l'ensemble.

Avec cela j'ai prit un chocolat chaud qui n'était pas vraiment chaud d'ailleurs, dommage...

Le service était lent du début à la fin que ce soit pour prendre notre commande puis apporter les plats et donner la facture... 

Si vous avez une grande faim je ne vous conseil pas de prendre le bretzel maison car une amie a pris cela et c'était une toute petite portion (voir photo)."}
{"text":"Well executed food but the flavor combinations just don't work.

Braised beef shoulder was perfectly cooked and super tender.  However the apple and avocado did not work with the tomato base sauce that it was served with.
Similar with the slow cooked salmon - very well cooked salmon but the watermelon, zucchini, etc was not a good flavor mix.

Overall it was a good experience, the waiter was excellent, good atmosphere, nice open kitchen.  I would probably go back but would like to see the food improve."}
{"text":"Un super lieu pour bruncher en fin de semaine. Il est possible de réserver, le service est très agréable. Les plats sont bons, originaux tant dans le sucré que dans le salé, tout en restant abordables. En plus, la carte change à chaque fin de semaine ce qui donne envie d'y revenir prochainement. Les trois autres personnes, qui m'accompagnaient, étaient toutes autant satisfaites de leur plats."}
{"text":"Why do people think it's trendy to have super uncomfortable seats? This is not cool, this is annoying. 
Also, any food that is deep fried, battered, cooked in copious amounts of butter or covered in syrup is going to taste good but that doesn't make you a good cook. It makes you an overpriced McDonalds. 
The brunch options had enough calories for the rest of the day and the vegetarian options were either a salad or one of two sugary dishes that would make a poutine look like ax kale smoothie. What about an omelette? What about eggs florentine? This restaurant just invented a bunch of super fattening dishes to compensate for the fact that they're mediocre chefs. 

Finally, 3.50 for a very small glass of room temperature orange juice? Unless you have the orange tree in back, this a rip off."}
{"text":"The open kitchen in the Center of La Fabrique let's you watch the chefs at work.

The food is very good.  The beet salad is great. The steaks are cooked properly, but not amazing. The sweet potato soup was very good. The complimentary bread and pickles were great.

There was one thing that I experienced here that was AMAZING. La Fabrique had two cooks, two waitresses, and one busboy serving the entire place. (Probably 25-30 tables). The service was excellent. The waitresses smiled, made drinks, poured refills, and rang up checks as if we were the only people in there. I have never experienced such efficiency in any restaurant."}
{"text":"Jamais je n'aurais eu l'idée de choisir un restaurant Français durant mon séjour à Montréal , mais j'ai suivi un groupe d'amis canadiens, et... J'ai ador? La Fabrique.
Non seulement le lieu est beau et décalé comme je les aime, mais la cuisine est creative tout en gardant la juste valeur des saveurs et du goût. J'ai choisi \"les spaghettis pas cuits de Charlotte\" avec pétoncles, un régal."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Sunday morning and it wasn't too busy, just perfect. Nice restaurant and friendly service. Love that the kitchen is open in the middle of the restaurant so we can watch the chefs in action and put together their beautiful dishes. There is also a couple of tables by the front of the restaurant with wide open window facing the street/park that could be very nice too. As we were watching the chefs cooking, we got really excited about the food. The presentation is really nice, they have that fancy egg poacher machine that make the egg look oh so beautiful. However, when we tasted the food, we were a little disappointed. It wasn't bad at all, but we just expected so much more. It was a great experience, but I don't think I will come back here for a while."}
{"text":"Went for their brunch with a friend on a Sunday morning around 11:30pm. We couldn't get a seat outside, but were offered a seat inside. The atmosphere of the restaurant was super cute and dainty. I was a bit disappointed because we asked if we could sit outside when the seat became available, however the waitress said there aren't any (although the people who came after us got seated outside so I'm not sure what the matter with that is). Aside from that, service was pretty good. I got their coffee (pretty good, $2.50, but nothing special) and ordered the 'Pain Naan' (housemade naan bread with very rich goat cheese and other sauce and cucumbers on top, $16.00). The naan bread was not what I was expecting - as it wasn't the traditional gooey naan bread but rather a fluffier one. Goat cheese portion on top was great, however with the naan bread it was a bit too much and the flavour seemed to be missing something. Not sure if I would try the same thing again, but as the price was in reasonable range ($13-18) for brunch, maybe I'll come back when I visit Montreal again and try a different item."}
{"text":"A life saver. Imagine this. Saturday night, 5 pm 4 kids three adults no reservations. All food snobs. Enter La Fabrique. Outstanding food all around. They accommodated us on a short notice, even called us to give directions when we were lost and were very friendly. But the food. Yummy. I had the Mi-figue, mi-raisin, outstanding, i followed with the Ravioli of foie gras. Also perfect. Nice job."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and ordered a wonderful beef tartar that came topped with a soft and creamy egg yolk and my friend ordered a killer plate which made me so jealous (I suggest ordering one of their more creative plates). I came here last year for Mother's Day brunch and O-M-G it was unlike any brunch I've ever had... delicious and beautiful presentation. The waitress was so sweet and gave us a jar of cotton candy to share at the end.If you're looking for a brunch spot that's different from all the rest, I really suggest you choose this place and you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Came here for New Years dinner and loved loved! First, they called us ahead to make sure no one had any food allergies since it was a set menu. It's always appreciated when restaurants are mindful as such.

The layout and space is modern, cozy with the open kitchen being the center of attention. It was a great experience watching what was about to be served at your table. 

I'm not so adventurous with meat nor is French food my meal of choice. But everything from the rabbit ravioli to the sweetbreads surf and turf was fabulous! 

Service was excellent. And they spaced out the courses just right!

I will surely be returning to La Fabrique upon my next trip to Montréal! It's a keeper!"}
{"text":"J'y étais avec mon biyfriend pour le nouvel an ; menu dégustations 5 services plus accord mets vins. Omg tout était tellement beau et bon et d'une attention de grande qualité au service mais sans prétention.  Tres abordable pour ce haut niveau de cuisine. La photo qui accompagne cette critique était un gros ravioli de lapin braisé, j'en aurais mangé tiute la soirée."}
{"text":"Trying to find a restaurant on our last night in Montreal and happened across this gem via Open Table. Their sommelier graciously accommodated our party of 8 in spite of having a full house. It's a very hip, low key place with amazing food and service. Attentive to the highest degree - every detail was attended to with the warmest of attitude. We're so glad we were able to have such a fabulous gastronomic experience during our visit to beautiful Montreal."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place.  A very unique atmosphere, kind of hipster-like, but it was cozy and welcoming.  I liked being able to see all the chefs at work -- the kitchen in the middle of the dining room was a really neat touch.  I don't get to see a lot of places like that were I live.  

Started out with their house bread which came with some sort of cream cheese or sour cream spread.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  The homemade pickles they give you are also delicious.  Sweet and spicy, but in a unique way.  Then followed up with their toasted baguette with an assortment of Quebec cheeses.  Also really good -- I think the baguette was toasted with garlic.  I ordered the foie gras and my boyfriend ordered the beef shoulder.  The foie gras was beautifully presented, slightly crispy on the edges and buttery tasting.  I didn't try my boyfriend's beef, but he said it was amazing and keeps telling everyone how good it was.  We finalized the meal with some dessert.  I had their passion fruit yogurt with rhubarb and puffed millet.  Delicious, sweet, and tart.  My boyfriend had the meringue.  I'm not a fan of meringue, but I am a fan of La Fabrique's meringue.  It's sweet and has a flavor that I've never tasted before in a meringue.  They followed up our desserts with a serving of cotton candy, and that made my night, because I LOVE cotton candy.  

If you want a truly unique meal with some beautifully presented dishes and a great wait staff, La Fabrique is the place to go."}
{"text":"As recommended by our hotel concierge, La Fabrique was very much the exact restaurant we were looking for visiting from Denver, Colorado.

Our request to our hotel concierge of ANYTHING in Montreal needed to meet our criteria: Local, non-tourist, new, the perfect feel for Montreal, young, hip, swanky but not snobby, and fair priced - but not cheap.

We made reservations for 6:00pm as we wanted to make it to the fire works for the Montreal High Lights Festival that Friday evening downtown.

We parked our rental Yaris on the street right out front on St-Denis.  The interior was of modern browns, plastic fishing boat seats and exposed red brick blending very well together.  The open central kitchen organized of silver cooking utensils, blackened cooking grills and clear plastic containers of fresh ingredients filled the narrow restaurant with a wonderful aroma.

My girlfriend ordered a Shiraz - 25cl of wine [about two glasses] and I ordered their Quebec Wheat Ale.  Very good recommendations.

Before our appetizer arrived, complimentary grilled French bread with a large jar of sweet pickles and homemade butter is what we nibbled on.  As I love pickles, I was already in seventh heaven.

As we were not able to read the French menu, our waiter helped running to another waitress for translation.  Soon, our wonderful dinning neighbors also stepped in to decipher the menu.  We settled on the stuffed pigs feet type egg rolls as our appetizer.  The inside was a sweet hot creamy mixture on a bed of julienne apples.  Just enough for two.  

My girlfriend ordered the Veel Cheeks on thick perfectly cooked turnip slices.  Topped with whole steamed carrots and a very nice gravy/sauce.  I ordered the Special: Pork and Scallops with mashed potatoes, a potato type bread and a wonderful gravy/sauce.  Both of our dishes were perfectly prepared. 

The atmosphere was casual and full of conversation.  The large back area and table filled with a surprise birthday party followed by the group singing Happy Birthday to the birthday boy.

Our waiter, waitress and neighboring patrons made our \"outsider and visiting\" experience more of a local and welcoming experience.  Everyone was very helpful and the food was better than expected.  I really hope my Non-Canadian experience helped with deciding to visit La Fabrique.  I really really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several time, mostly for brunch. I did one or two dinners here. I love it personally. The ambiance is nothing spectacular. It is a nice restaurant, looks like many restaurants I have been to. The food though is very good. The service is on point."}
{"text":"Best French cuisine experience!!!!

Visiting Montreal during the new year and most of my favorite restaurants were closed, so I had to call up a few restaurants to see if they were open, and, voila, La Fabrique was there to save us!"}
{"text":"Very good French restaurant. Tasty Foie gras served on top of risotto. The chef cook in front you. The service is also great, explain the menu well. Not a big restaurant but good for friend gathering. They closed at 930 but can serve longer if you get in before that."}
{"text":"We had a very large group here for brunch. Reserving the place and figuring out the menu ahead of time was quite difficult. They were extremely slow to respond to email correspondence, we had to actually call a couple of times to get to someone. We were told that for a large group we had to select just a few entrees ahead of head, but then of course never heard back and they just offered everyone the full menu the day of. 

The open kitchen that occupies the center of the restaurant is very neat. The tables right next to the kitchen, where we were sat, are quite close to the cooking area. The issue is probably if you lean back too much, you will touch it and I certainly hope people don't sneeze or something.

The menu itself was quite interesting, I would even call some of the combinations unusual. Sometimes it's a little difficult to figure out what is being served because each item is just a list of ingredients. 

I wanted something lighter so opted for the French Toast. The bread itself was awesomely thick and the sides were nice and crisp. The remainder of the dish was a mix of diced fruit, some white chocolate chips and this fruity mousse. It was a strange combination with the toast and unfortunately made the bottom of it a bit soggy. I did not get to try everyone else is food, but \"interesting\" was a common theme. I could consider coffee and tea being served in glasses with no handle to be the same."}
{"text":"Fabulous experience in this open kitchen restaurant.  Everything is fresh, made with meticulous care, well presented, creative and delicious.  Great wine list and Stephanie was very knowledgeable not only about the food and ingredients but about the the wines.  Will definitely come back when back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Localisation très appréciée entre le parc Lafontaine et le Square Saint-Louis.
Une carte des plats pour le brunch qui sort agréablement des oeufs classiques.
Le concept de la cuisine au centre du restaurant est très original.
Bon service et pas d'attente pour un dimanche midi."}
{"text":"If I upload more than five photos of a place, I'm a fan. 

If I write \"Get this!\" on every food photo, I'm a big fat fan. 

Love this place. Genuine people working an open kitchen, full-steam ahead, in a relaxed-but-hip ambiance. Excellent service. 

Each dish was not only beautifully presented, but also, each dish tasted delicious. Love how they do the salmon tartare with cranberries. They take that salmon to the edge - where it's not so soft as to be mistaken for cat food (major dislike) but where it is smooth, with just a hint of texture. If ever I lose my teeth, this shall sustain me. I'd be relocating for salmon tartare. I've made crazier moves. 

Is this pain perdu?! Pain perdu was a not a trick, hiding under vellum-thin pineapple sheets...it was a treat! 
Ouefs mollets did not disappoint - ample mayo in this dish, so venture forth at your own risk. It's worth it. 

They take reservations, by the way."}
{"text":"Brunch - pain perdu = phenomenal french bread! the crispy edge and the syrup make this dish absolutely divine! A little intense for breakfast in terms of sweetness, but I would happily split this with someone who would take a salty plate.

pudding  au pain - I had a small bite, it's a soft, moist bread with a nice sweet taste, coupled with saltier side of poultry, and a squash puree. Also very tasty, great for someone who wants something salty and sweet . 

Oeuf moelleux - will not likely order again as it lacked taste. I usually complain that dishes are too salty, but this one was short on flavors. The lentil salad was great, but the remainder of the dish was a definite miss."}
{"text":"Elegant little restaurant! They change their menu every week so it is only in French. The wait staff is super friendly and read the entire menu to us in English. The translation of the description may have been a little off, but the food is of the highest quality and the attention to detail of taste and presentation is high! There may be too many tastes going on with each menu item for my liking, but it is well thought out and put together.

The salmon cream cheese bretzel was delicious! 

Romantic, coZy atmosphere across the street from a nice park"}
{"text":"Holy crap on this brunch!! On our first trip to Montreal, our restaurant try list was mostly derailed since we didn't make any reservations. So on a Sunday morning, we were hoping for the best on various places. We stopped here, on a gorgeous day, and were able to score a table on the patio (for 3) after waiting 10-15 minutes. 

I ordered an egg dish with cheese, zucchini, corn, and some toast. It was light, fluffy, and delicious. I tried not to demolish it and share but it was very difficult. 

Kana K ordered a French toast with fruit which was equally light (not in calories, of course) and delicious. 

Brian T ordered a steak tartare which a) I usually steer clear of and b) I happily ate a few bites of. Just delicious and well flavored. 

For drinks, I had a mimosa and Brian T tried a maple whiskey on the menu (chilled). That whiskey was the start of a new addiction for Brian T, haha, and maybe me too!

Great service and restaurant. Must go again on our next visit."}
{"text":"Fabulous dining experience.  I had the beef shoulder (pictured) and it was one of the most flavorful and tender red meats I have every enjoyed.    La Fabrique leaves cotton candy on the house while you wait for your check!  PS  my dining parter for the night had salmon and loved it!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the closest restaurants to you are the ones you never check out. They sit on your \"to visit\" list and get ignored. Be it because you forget about them or get distracted by other places. This year's taste MTL allowed me to finally eliminate one such place from my list - La Fabrique Bistrot. Situated in front of St-Louis Square and a short walk from my neighbourhood, this open kitchen concept restaurant makes quite the impression when you walk in. The kitchen right in the middle of the room, beautifully wood panelling all around and tons of lighting accents. It creates a very inviting and rustic feel all without losing the fine dining element.

For taste MTL, they were offering a 39$ menu that combined regular menu items with some other options. They also offered a wine pairing option for an additional 27$ for each of the meal. My dining companions and I went with this option and were satisfied with the selections - particularly the Muscato I received during the dessert course.

Prior to the actual menu, we received a small bowl of squash, corn and nut soup as an amuse-bouche. Nice and rich, we were pleasantly surprised by the addition of the corn and the nuts. The corn provided some sweetness and the nuts a little salt on top of the texture additions both provided. A nice starter to the meal.

The 2 appetizers offered for Taste MTL were a beetroot, carrot and orange salad with horseradish cream and ratatouille in a terrine with Vitello tomato and foccaccia. The salad was wonderfully light and fresh with a strong kick from the horseradish to spice things up. The ratatouille terrine was a very unique concept that worked beautifully and the sauce provided a nice creamy component to mix with the terrine.

The first main course was a slowly cooked pork with apple, squash, turnip and sweet potato sautéed with Papineau's maple syrup and ginger. Perfectly executed, the pork just felt apart. The fattiness of the pork was augmented nicely with the sweetness of the maple syrup and the freshness of the vegetables in the dish. The addition of the cheddar on top added some nice sharpness as well. A very creative and delicious dish all around.

The second main was salmon preserved in sunflower oil with miniature pepper, parsnip, onion and a carrot purée. The preparation here was a bit more straight forward compared to the pork dish but very well done. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the carrot puree was wonderfully sweet. The other vegetables were good but didn't hit home as much as the puree.

We also ordered an extra side of home fries as they are fried in duck fat and served with house ketchup. Duck fat always adds a little something extra to dishes and that was no exception here. The fries had just that little extra taste and bite which was nice. The house-made ketchup had a nice tanginess to it as well. 

For dessert, the options were French toast with clove caramel and fleur de sel or an apple and maple syrup in a homemade yogurt cream. The French toast was ridiculous - a thick cut slice of bread with a rich and cream caramel with just the right hint of salt to balance out the sweetness. The apple, maple and yogurt mixture was quite good as well but got quickly overshadowed by the French toast. And then, once the bills came, so did our final surprise dessert - house cotton candy! Nice, sweet and fluffy without that pesky stickiness which hampers handling. A very playful way to end a great meal.


From beginning to end, la Fabrique was a great experience. Having the kitchen in the middle of the dining room is a cool hook to get you in but the great food and atmosphere are what will make you come back for more. It is nice to know I have another awesome restaurant a short walk over in my neighbourhood. Just another reminder to not ignore what you have close to you. You may be pleasantly surprised. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Then a warm serving of cotton candy when they bring you the bill!"}
