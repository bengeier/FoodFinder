{"text":"Horrible exprience! Husband was kicked out for smoking his e cig when a bouncer saw him.  he had been puffing it all night in the vip room and no one said anything.  told him he needed to get his f****** s***out of there then called him a faggot.  I got a little mouthy with the bouncers.  They assulted me knocked me down and actually broke my foot! I have the medical records to prove it!  this night turned out to be a nightmare!!!! Hate this place...bouncers are out of control!!! Never Again!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken wings and an iced tea that came in a fun mason jar. Music was pretty loud but service was good and the bartenders did mad tricks."}
{"text":"Toby's is an awesome little dance hall and bar. The live bands and dj are always good and keep you entertained. The bar is a little pricey but the drinks are to die for."}
{"text":"Loved! But I might be bias because I do love anything country. Was my first time here, good food and good drinks. The staff was very friendly and food came quick, although it wasn't really full when we went. Found a new favorite drink, it's a specialty drink called \"Whiskey Girl\", which came in a mason jar. I'm a fan of Jack so I had to try it. If anyone remembers what is in this drink feel free to let me know. Got to have more of this drink!"}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying that based on the reviews I've read here,  my experience does not seem to be all that unique. I worked in this industry for many years and understand that you cannot please everyone 100%. This place seems to be trying to set a record though!
     I have been here 4 or 5 times, I had issues on each try. The most recent was the last straw though. My wife and I actually had a pretty decent evening right up until we were getting ready to leave. We came in and sat at the bar around 8 o'clock. We had some of the over priced beers and food. We did not interact with anybody but ourselves and the bartender. At around 1:30 we paid our tab and had the bartender call us a cab. While we were waiting for the cab to arrive I was approached by one of the extremely over aggressive bouncers and asked to step outside. (I actually think this was case of mistaken identity initially, because the guys next to us had to be cut off and we being very belligerent.) Once outside, I asked him what the problem was? He proceeded to tell me I had to leave because I was tripping over barstools. I never tripped over anything all night!! Then he said I was falling asleep at the bar. Again totally false. I was fine up til now but when I looked in the bar I noticed two other bouncers interrogating my wife at the bar, I decided this was enough. I proceeded back into the bar and immediately asked to speak to the manager. Heather, the night manager came over and introduced herself, totally oblivious of the situation that was unfolding. As I began to explain to her, she stopped me and referred me back to bouncers who were causing the problem in the first place! At this point the situation with the bouncers was becoming increasingly aggressive as if they were trying to get into a brawl with me. It was so intense that I actually had to call the police on them before the situation became uncontrollable. While outside waiting for the police and the cab, several bouncers were escorting my wife out of the bar. They were taunting her and making jokes about her. She asked the \"head of security\" for his or the managers business card 5 times only to be told they don't have any. He finally proceeded to right their names on a kids menu, in crayon, no less. Unfortunately, when the police arrived they filled out an incident report but were unable to do anything because of the \"right to refuse service law\" and there was no physical altercation yet. I guess next time I will wait until they hit me first. 
     To the GM of this establishment: don't bother to respond to this review with platitudes. Since you never returned any of the 4 messages I left with Heather and other managers for you, I assume this is of no interest to you anyway.

One final thought, \"What is the purpose of bouncers throwing out patrons who have already paid their bill and were leaving anyway? Egos I guess!\""}
{"text":"Great food & service as always, no five star due to menu change. No longer have the meatloaf or fish n chips!"}
{"text":"Great food. Theme doesn't really go."}
{"text":"The food was so good and the portions were really big! The live music was great and all of the servers were friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from San Diego and I was so excited just bc I love Toby Keith. It's Mon evening so the place is pretty empty, no biggie. We get a table right away but our server doesn't come by until maybe 15 mins later. We order appetizers and drinks. Our drinks were bland and flat. When we're ordering our food I order the surf and turf, I wanted mashed potatoes, and to my surprise they had run out of mashed potatoes! Ended up with creamy macaroni and cheese, french fries and onion rings. My sirloin was cold as was the rest of my food. Not impressed AT all. I definitely will not be going back. The server wasn't very attentive either. Sorry I was really looking forward to this place."}
{"text":"I would love to be able to review but even though opening time is posted at 11 the restaurant was not open at 11:25. Even tried calling and no one answered. Lost 4 customers today."}
{"text":"Updated review.  This place keeps going downhill.  We come here normally 3 times a year and we finally decided not to return.  The food and service continues to fall well below what you would expect from this place. 

We went over the past few years from big fans to stay away.  This most recent visit, we came in for lunch and got Nachos & the Cowboy Reuben. The nachos were just ok.  The Cowboy Reuben corned beef brisket was dry and the bread just overpowered the sandwich.  Too much bread.  

We have tried many things on the menu in the past from burgers, quesadillas, and chicken sandwiches, wings, pulled pork, soups and wraps.  Everything is just blah.  Not worth the money and the service is hard to come by.  We are really disappointed in this place and will go elsewhere in the future.  It is truly a shame that this place just keeps going downhill.  Toby, do something about it!  You lost a big fan."}
{"text":"Being a big country music fan, I knew that I would enjoy this place before visiting, but I had no idea our whole group would fall in love with it like we did. The environment was awesome: country music playing with the wild bartenders doing tricks nonstop. Service was good, the waitress was pretty quick and knowledgable with the menu..she made a couple recommendations that turned out to be awesome. The food was top notch!! All 9 of us agreed that the fries were the best we had ever had. I got an old western burger that is up there as one of the top 10 hamburgers I have ever had. Everyone else had great things to say about the food. As for the prices, it's Vegas, of course they are going to be high. This was one of the cheaper dinners we had though, my burger and fries were only $15..I paid 20+ for muuuuch worse throughout the weekend. Looks like it would be a fun place to visit at night with the floor for line dancing and very entertaining bar tenders. I'm sure we will be visiting 'I love this bar' multiple times on our next Vegas trip!!"}
{"text":"Went to this bar/restaurant to meet up with my friend and his female friend. Though I only stayed for a few minutes and just had a beer and fried Mac and cheese balls, I thought the atmosphere was pretty good. And the wait staff seems to be really friendly and fast. I'll give it three stars since I did not really stay that long to be able to really experience the place."}
{"text":"The Bar is a good starter bar for sure.  The food was good and if you like toby keiths music it is a good place to go.  But is like jimmy buffets bar you do get sick of the music after a few hours.  Im had a good time both times i have been there.  The reason Brendan  m did'nt like it because he looks like the first guy who gets punched in a bar fight.  It proably happend so thats another lesson don't go to jet with a bad shirt and don't get in a fight in a country bar."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday to see what \"live band karaoke\" was all about.  They said it started at 8:00 on their sign, but it started at 9:00.  Band had around 100 songs to pick from,, or maybe 125.  I knew very few of them.  Noise level was sort of loud until the band took over.  Then it was rattle the tables loud.  This is clearly aimed at the younger crowd.  If you are older you most likely will not want to have your ears tortured.  If you want to go for the food only, go early in the evening.  No cover charge on Tuesday.

Did not eat, but looked at a menu.  Prices seemed a little high but not overly so.  Bowl of chili was $5, which seems ok (assuming the bowl is normal sized).  My friend and I do not drink, but she got a non-alcohol beer.  It was $4.  I do not know if that is normal or not.  Seemed high to me.  I got soda.  The waitress comp'd it, so the bill was not too high in the long run.  I tipped her accordingly.

Lot's of sports TV's around the place.  Waitress was attentive, for the most part.  Bathrooms were large and clean.  

A couple of menu surprises.  They have fried bologna.  Thick slices.  Never seen that in a restaurant.  Also, they have Miracle Whip.  Means I can get their Club Sandwich with the thing I like on my club.  I know of no other restaurant that has Miracle Whip, and I have asked at all of them.

Giving it 3 stars because it had it's issues and its pluses.  Most likely would not return, except for the chili and Miracle whip.  If I do, it will be earlier in the evening, and I will sit away from the music (if there is such a place)."}
{"text":"I love Toby Keith and his music. This place only open for 3 mo. but still a few bugs to take care of. The music is a little too loud for lunch. I mean after 7PM maybe its ok, but those of us who like to TALK to each other its a little loud. Lots of TK music which is good. One of the stalls in ladies room cannot lock, the sliding thingy was put in upside down. I told our server and Heather the mgr. Altho I like the song, hubby does NOT like drinking his beer in a plastic red Solo cup! Again, maybe after 7PM. Our server, Samantha, seemed to take too long for any request we had - beer, tea refill. The Rueben sandwich I had was cold, well cool really and probably because of ALL the cole slaw put on it. It tasted ok but I had to ask Heather to heat it up some. They were most accommodating. Portions were pretty good sized. Hubby really liked his chicken parm sandwich  -  the bun was very soft and not the hard roll - ate it all!! $8 lunch pretty good. I don't like french fries but Samantha said I could substitute sweet potato tots and they WERE hot. Heather gave us her card."}
{"text":"My family of 6 comes out to Toby Keith's every Tuesday night for line dancing lessons (family friendly, start at 8pm) and dinner. My boys love the kids ribs basket and I'm a big fan of the brisket plate or the chicken mac n cheese. Service is slow and getting a waitress to check back on us once we've got our food is rare, so drinks often go unfilled and extra requests like a side of ranch or extra napkins must be made when we order or there's little chance of having them fulfilled. These are our \"lessons learned\" from weekly visits. All that said, line dancing instructor, Tory, makes it all worth it. She earns 5 stars on her own for making line dancing fun and approachable for the beginner and the way she engages the kids is fabulous. My kids can't wait for Tuesday nights to learn a new line dance and get some energy out on the dance floor.  If you're looking for a fun activity outside of your norm on a Tuesday night consider slipping on your boots and coming out to Toby Keith's for dinner and some fun."}
{"text":"I came in tonight for a solo dinner.  I was seated right away (because I made a reservation) and then I waited.  After about 5 minutes my waitress came over. At first I was a little annoyed that I waited so long to be acknowledged but then she was really nice and friendly. 
The food was good and came pretty quick considering how busy they were.
All in all I would recommend stopping by for dinner if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews. We stopped at 11:30am on a Friday morning and waited 20 minutes for the server to acknowledge our presence.  Then once the order was in we waited for another 20 minutes for our simple burgers and sandwiches. 3 tables around us seated after us had ordered and gotten food, and eaten most before we even got our food. 
Server was apathetic and disengaged with our complaint when raised. Management made no effort to address it other than to tell Server to discount 20%.  Didn't even talk to us. 
Save your money folks and spend it somewhere they want your business. 
We were sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"My experience was not a good one. Last night was my first time there.
I expected more from a big name like Toby Keith and for a restaurant on the las vegas strip.
The service was terrible.  The lady who took my order didn't bring it or didn't check to see how the meal was also getting my beverage took way longer then it should. I ordered the rib plate and never got any extra bbq sauce the entire meal. Also I was supposed to receive rolls w mini cornbread and butter which I did not get! When my waitress finally came back to give my check I told her I never received my rolls and she asked me if I still wanted it? Like it was an issue to bring me something I was supposed to get in the beginning?  The ribs were dry, the macaroni n cheese was cold and hard. And once again the service was not acceptable. 
I would not refer this restaurant to any one!"}
{"text":"Really disapointed; burger cost way to much for an unseasoned patty. Not even on the level of say Red Robbin. Wife has a Reuben sandwich that she said was 1/2 decent. Even the 16 oz beer I got tasted like the Draft lines hadn't been cleaned in years.  I could swing in for a drink and music but won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Very few good choices at Harrahs. Figured it might be ok given the simple faire. Likeable staff, the usual loud sports stuff, but still places not quite full volume if you look around. Food is unfortunate as you expect in Las Vegas. Indifferent prep and presentation.  Buying less expensive entree would probably be a better call to reduce the ripped off sensation that really adds to the insult.  Beware of being offered a \"double\" when ordering drinks. Not only is the price double, but they then add another \"double fee\" on top of that. The drink costs more than a rib eye dinner!  Pretty clever.  Good place to go if you like loud, mediocre and don't care what it costs to get it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go in Vegas! Touristy as it may be, I love this bar! :0) 

The food is fabulous, the wait staff is super friendly (and fast), and the atmosphere is fun, loud, and definitely country.

My husband and I loved the chili cheese fries. I had the catfish po' boy, and he had the cowboy Reuben. They were both delicious, and we HAD to get to go boxes. 

If you're around Toby Keith's, I would definitely take the time to stop in and try it.  We have been here 5+ times and haven't been disappointed yet! (Yelp also says it's not a kid place, but I wouldn't see why kids wouldn't have a blast as long as they come before about 9 or so.)"}
{"text":"Went here before the Cards game, because there was a long wait at BJ's.  There was no wait, and the place was pretty empty.  It didn't take long to see why! Before we were even seated, I overheard the servers trying to figure out who was getting our table of 15 and it was like a game of \"not it\"; nobody wanted to wait on us.  Having been a server before I would jump at the chance to serve a party of our size.  The appetizers came, and about 7 minutes later our plates that we needed to eat our apps came.  The food was ok, nothing fantastic and just basic bar food. We had two servers four our table, and saw them each perhaps 5 times total.  I ended up going to the bar to get a glass of water as the one I asked for never came.  The worst part, however, is that I was charged for 2 drinks that we didn't order, AND the itemized bill was one price, yet the amount they can my card for was 5$ more than the itemized bill.  They couldn't explain why, but I would highly recommend you double check your bill, and compare it to the itemized receipt  before leaving. I will never return.  The one good thing I can say about the place is that the bathroom is very clean :)"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and were lucky that a live band was setting up to play.  We started off with a half order of nachos.  Luckily, we only ordered a half order!  They were huge, but yummy.  We also had ordered burgers which were really good, but huge as well.  We both can eat quite a bit, but could not finish what we ordered.  Should have split a dinner.  Everything was good.  We also ordered beer and margaritas in the mason jars.  Pricey, but huge.  

The band was good and lots of people dancing to their music and the DJ's on their break.

We love this bar and definitely would go back."}
{"text":"On Saturday me and a group went into to eat food was great but the waitress was the best we had in Vegas we had so far.  We've been here for 6 day for the 4th and Julie  or server went out of her way to take care of us.  Will start off my next Vaca there.  If your a fan of toby Keith most stop here."}
{"text":"Check this place out. The drinks are fantastic! They have a live band, I believe every night... Good service at the table and at the bar. We had a great time. Went there 2 nights in a row.  Country music makes you happy :)"}
{"text":"After reading many so-so reviews, we decided to just for for it and hoped for the best. Maybe we got lucky, but it was pretty good! The service was terrible, but the food was delicious so for us it evened out. My husband and I shared a burger with fries and  the nachos (off the appetizer menu) and he also had a beer, which might have been bigger (like many have said!) if they had more than just bottles. We found that we needed more sour cream with the nachos and our waiter didn't come around until we were pretty much finished with our meal. So, bottom line: go, and ask for and extras when you order so you don't go without them."}
{"text":"Is not somewhere I'd go to eat food, so can't comment on that. However, the band was great. Beer prices are Vegas Style-overboard. Are there waitresses here? Unsure, as we had beer bottles and glassware from the entire day sitting on our table the entire three hours we were here.  And we always had to go up to the bar and order. Two buckets of  beer will run you around $75."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this establishment. I do not have bad things to say like the other reviews. The service was great, and food was tasty. We did come here because BJ'S was busy, and glad we did. If I am in area I will check this place out again. If you are looking for a place to drink and get roudy, this is not strictly a bar..."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. My party of two had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated. This doesn't sound like a lot but the table they seated us at was available the whole time. Then we had to wait a long time for the drinks to arrive. We had to remind the waitress to bring them. We put our food order in immediately with our drinks. The waitress had to take a large table order immediately after. She messed up our order so we had to eat in stages. Then the manager came over and didn't want to make it up to us. So we overpaid for two sandwiches, our meal was ruined, and we just had to deal with it?! No we finally got the difficult manager to take care of part of the meal but it shouldn't have been this hard. Start to finish the service was awful. The food wasn't good either. The Reuben was a joke. It had two literally two slices of corned beef on it. The sausage sandwich was very chewy. I would never consider going back to any of these restaurants, nationwide."}
{"text":"Walked into this place looking for country music on the strip, and maybe have a beer or two. We heard exactly two country songs before the dance music switched over, and never went back.  What the heck?  Overpriced drinks and dance music? If you want country, go across the street to Gilley's."}
{"text":"Just average food and average service and is priced just ok.  

I would not go again."}
{"text":"No service in the bar area if you want to order something you have to go to the bar like at McDonald's if I could give a negative star I would stay away from this place"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas. I go here at least once every time we come. 32 ounce jack and cokes to accompany a delicious burger. Just know that the 100 ounce Big Dog Daddy Challenge is no joke."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my boyfriend when we were visiting Vegas, lets just say I think he enjoyed this place better than I did with all these girls running around half naked with their ass's out. It was WAY to loud to the point where we couldn't even hear each other talk, and it was in the middle of the week and wasn't too busy- but the music was so loud. The waitress was nice and was more interested in my boyfriend RIGHT IN-FRONT of me than taking our order. I like the place in CA near Bas Pro in the garden shopping center...they are WAYYYY better than this place. I know its vegas, but seriously?! Your making this company look horrible.

AND the food seemed old and was COLD and took FOREVER to come out...."}
{"text":"I Love this bar! The steak was delicious and the waitress was very attentive... What was the most  surprising was the fact that we had a groupon and the waitress didn't treat us any differently.. Some restaurants act like you are using food stamps when you have a groupon.. Thanks ladies!"}
{"text":"The music was good the food was good, the service was horrible! The manager, Melissa, was incredibly rude! For the price of the food and drinks you'd expect better customer service. I love Toby Keith, but I don't love this bar."}
{"text":"Who Manages this place? 

Service
Bad. My server was nice tried and checked on us multiple times excellent. But front gatekeeper Isabel was irritating especially as she asked us if we were military for a discount and being Toby Keith would figure he had a good support of military. We said yes as I am in Officer Candidate School, my friends both with multiple deployments in Army and other was marines but Isabel in a rude manner said well your not active. Which was infuriating.

Food and drinks
Food chicken fajitas were OK but still was hungry after. I ordered a whiskey mule but she said that they are suppose to carry ginger beer and was going to check. They are suppose to carry it but bartender never has seen it. I asked for ginger ale it's the same but there ale isn't ale as its made with sprite and some other and not the best. I ended up drinking water after the running around to check for it, I had finished my food"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes without ever seeing our server and during that time it took more than ten minutes for a busser to get our waters to the table. All of this and the restaurant wasn't even crowded, it was actually almost empty. There is no reason for service this poor. This is the only time I have ever walked out of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I really really want this place to succeed.. But I have not been impressed with their service. Each time I've been in (multiple times) the girls are so SLOW to get to us and then get our drinks. Also, the margarita tasted like it came from a pre-made mix that I could go buy at Fry's. There is also a plethora of girls standing at the front doing nothing while we wait and wait for service which seems to happen every time we go. I hope the staff continues to get better customer service training."}
{"text":"The food was good, the music was good.  My only complaint is that they weren't very busy when we arrived, and yet we stood there like we were invisible watching 3 employees chatting away behind the host station right in front of us.  We finally asked if any of them were allowed to seat people.  They jumped to it and we were led to a table by a young girl in a sexy outfit.  Most of the girls wore them....all of the servers, anyway.  Their butt cheeks were on display underneath chaps.  That would be OK with me, if the good looking young guys who work there had to wear the same type garb.  If just the women wear these outfits, I feel it's exploiting them.  On the flip side, we ladies would like a little eye candy to.  My suggestion....everyone has butt cheeks on display, or no one has butt cheeks on display"}
{"text":"Wow such an amazing experience. First of all the food was amazing! The service was perfect as well. And to top it off I got a free meal with a beer for being in the military. Deff would pay just to eat the food again! Deff recommend coming here"}
{"text":"The food was terrible for the price. We ordered fried pickles and they were bland, battered pickle spears. Just didn't expect it to be spears, typically they are pickle chips.  Four total pickle spears for $8.

Then we moved to dinner, there was four of us eating and we all ordered medium. The burgers were all well done. Didn't expect for a $17.00 burger that it would come out well done when we ordered medium. The only good part was the fries. Oh and if you want to add bacon is a $2.00 charge.... 

Keep in mind for a bottle beer it's around $8 and for a draft, mason jar beer is $13. 

So for two people to eat we spent $80.00 for a not so great meal....... not worth it for the price!! 

Definitely wish we had waited in line for a highly rated $30 buffet within the same casino area!"}
{"text":"Horrible! I wouldn't feed my dog this crap.  We had a salad and poor boy sandwich. The chicken in the salad was undercooked and the lettuce was way too old to be serving. The service was terrible as well."}
{"text":"Ok me about 8 friends all met up there on a sat, night we all arrived before the cover charge  before 10pm.  The service was not that good. It took at least 10 mins to get a drink.  And the draft beer was $7.00 for large and $4.00 for the small red solo cup. We did not see any. Specials  on sat, night. (Bummer)    Another letdown was the seating fiasco.  We had a few tables since we had 8 in our party and the staff at 10pm decides to remove all the tables and chairs on the south side of this bar so they could roll up the glass doors to the stinky smoking patio  and then it became much more hotter in here.  So now its standing only unless we could find a few tables on the other side of this place. This place is so packed  and there is no empty tables anywhere.  This sucks.  The other negative is this place is so loud you have to scream  so  we can talk to each other.  This place is  packed. Its not fun.  The dance floor is so small and packed as well.  So forget about dancing   And yes there is way too many security guys  and most of them are just chattin with other staff/females. This place needs to change a few things before i go honky tonkin  there again. I would rather go to saddle ranch down the street at westgate  next time.  I would go back to this place for lunch though.  The food is good."}
{"text":"I hate this bar and grill.  Seriously.

We had some friends in town that had enjoyed Toby Keith's a few years ago and wanted to go back.  So we made the stop at Harrah's on a late Sunday afternoon.  On the way to the casino, I called ahead to make reservations.  You can't.  So I asked how busy they were, expecting the girl on the other end of the phone to tell me there would be a wait.  Instead, I was told \"We are the opposite of busy.\"  Things weren't looking good already.

We were immediately seated and I enjoyed the feel of the place.  I'm not into country music but I don't mind it playing in the background.  It's pretty much an Applebee's or TGI Fridays feel, except with a country theme.  But you can only enjoy the scenery for so long....

We waited, and waited, and waited.  It took at least 15 minutes before our server even came over to greet us and get our drink orders.  Someone in my group wanted one of the specialty mixed drinks that are listed on the back of the menu (the ones that come in mason jars - 19 flipping dollars).  When my friend asked how much a 16-ounce version of the drink would be, she was told it was $12 but it would only come with a half a shot in it.  What??  I'm going to just say that we misheard or she misspoke, because that can't be right at all.  And the bad signs kept on coming....

I would say a good half hour went by before we got our meals.  I ordered the quesadillas with veggies and they were awful.  DRIPPING in grease- I had to blot them with napkins just so I didn't get grease on my clothes.  It was served with some sad shredded iceberg, mushy chopped tomatoes, and a super boring poblano salsa.  I managed to eat half and then called it a day.  $13, but worth $0.

My husband ordered the Ranch House Salad.  It claims to come with iceberg AND romaine, but there was only iceberg in that bowl.  Unless you're talking about a wedge salad, iceberg lettuce just screams cheap ingredients and that little thought went into making the salad.  He also got a couple of slices of tomato, a little bit of cheese and croutons, and about a tablespoon of corn.  On the side were two enormous containers of ranch dressing- you know, in case you want to eat 1200 calories in salad dressing during your meal.   $12, but worth about $6.

We also got a side of fries for $5.  They were actually really good (especially with all the leftover ranch from my husband's salad) and the portion was pretty generous.

My friends ordered the She's a Hottie Wrap and the Steak Sandwich.  I didn't hear anything good or bad about their food or the mason jar drink.

We then proceeded to wait again for the check and for it to be brought back to sign once we paid.  Our drinks were refilled once the entire time we were there.

When it was all said and done, my friend said that a few years ago it was a fun place to be.  Now there's just terrible service despite the fact that the place had zero customers.  There are typical overpriced menu items like you'll find all over the Strip and ridiculous price differences for Harrah's players card members vs. non-card customers.  

Do yourself a favor and go next door to the Venetian and eat at Grand Luxe- similar food and price but better quality and service with a larger menu.  Toby Keith's will do if you are starving and have a broken leg and you can't hop any farther before you pass out from hunger.

Oh, and there's a $6 charge if you want to split a meal with someone.  There should be crimes against stupid pricing like this."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a whim after buying a Groupon for it. Service was fine until she kept giving us the wrong receipt when we wanted to leave. It took three tries to get the correct receipt. Luckily I noticed otherwise we would have over paid by more than $20. The fried pickles were good but nothing special. My husband ordered chicken fried steak and he said it tasted good but it appeared to be chicken fried meatloaf. Strange! I ordered the rotisserie chicken which was dry. Sides tasted like they were made in big batches and left to sit under heat lamps all night. Atmosphere was good but I expected more from the food for the prices we paid."}
{"text":"Service is horrible.  March 2014 went with friends.  Waited 15 minutes before someone told us we could seat ourselves.  Waited another 30 minutes at table before waitress told us it was self serve at the bar.  Waited another 15 minutes to order beer from bartender.  Friends and I looked at each other and said it has almost been an hour, and no food, no beer, time to leave.  By the way this was at 3:00 pm in the afternoon.  I will not be going back to Toby Ketih's bar anytime soon."}
{"text":"Greatest bar ever! We come to Vegas once a year & spend the majority of our time in this bar, mainly because of the great & friendly bar staff. Leo the bartender is outstanding! Has us in stitches the entire time with his silly antics & Jimmy & Jay are just as wonderful! without them the place would not be nearly as fun, not to mention the wonderful security guard at the door, names Richard, incredibly helpful & kind. We always meet the greatest people here & look forward to going there every year! Im pretty sure we go to Vegas just because of this bar, would reccomend it to everyone, cant say enough good things about this establishment & its bartenders. (and security staff)"}
{"text":"I've ate here quite a few times. Sometimes I get excellent food and service, sometimes it's terrible. At night it is extremely loud (don't go there to hold a conversation) and it takes forever to put your order in, get a drink, and get your meal. It's not so bad earlier in the day, especially weekdays when it's less crowded. I usually get the steak and it's quality is usually great but not consistent. The burgers are excellent according to my husband."}
{"text":"Fun place. The band was great and so was the DJ. This place is a great time. The drinks are huge, but oh so tasty! We had a blast here."}
{"text":"I think I love this place just because the real name is \"Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill Bar and Grill.\" I love the atmosphere inside...and the little asian bartender? Hilarious. He made a whipped-cream phallus in some 50+ year old woman's drink and made her drink it from between his legs. Priceless. 
The food was OK, a little pricey (hello, Vegas), but the beer was good, the music was good. Good vibes all around.
+ you can smoke inside (boyfriend super excited)
+ Daisy Train (cute cover band)
- The girls dancing what looked like a routine over and over and over again
- The inevitable line dancing and stetson-wearing crew that shows up.
I'll go back again, just so we can yell \"Who put $20 on Toby?\" once more ;)"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. Service was awful, food was below average and if Toby Keith has any affiliation with this place I would say that he needs to get away from it. I would say listen to the other reviews and not go or go at your own risk of getting terrible food and service"}
{"text":"Toby Keith I Love This Bar & Grill... Ha!  Ridiculous!!! We walked two miles down the strip to get here. We expected country music (perhaps our mistake?? Toby meets Vegas... No thanks!!!) but we got pop music and a bartender that spent more time throwing the bottles around (attempting to look cool) then actually pouring and serving drinks. We're from San Diego and we have some great (country) bars there... This was so far from what we expected. Booooo!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy going here but this place has completely changed. The atmosphere used to be friendly, people came here to dance and have a great time. Management sucks and it shows in the servers faces and their high turnover. Unfortunately I would rather take my business and recommend you do as well to the place across the street cabin fever. Sorry Tobi's I was a loyal customer but you lost me today with poor management."}
{"text":"It must be embarrassing for Toby Keith to have his name attached to this place. The food is awful as well as the service. The people who work here have about an eighth grade education. They typically get your order wrong. DO NOT GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"I love country music therefor i loove this place. Ive been here two times and both times the live bands have been wonderful playing country as well as classic rock. very fun the dance on the dance floor. The bartenders are really into it and make drinking even more fun. I have never had the food here but id expect nothing too exciting just bar food. but if youre looking for a fun place to dance, not have to dress up too much and have a good time with fun people i would try this place!"}
{"text":"Three years ago when I started visiting Vegas on vacations I loved going to Toby Keith Bar because it had a great country feeling with a fun staff. The last two times I have come however it has been the complete opposite. The only reason it was so horrible the last two times was because of the bartenders. The first time I went we had a guy bartender who was giving attitude to every guy around us for no reason and only paid attention to hot girls who flirted with him. I would sit there forever waiting for a drink and when he finally got to me he got my order wrong and when I told him he told me I didn't tell him that drink and he made a big seen throwing my drink in the trash and giving me a dirty look. Later on in the night I saw him be rude to many polite customers and even kiss a few female customers which disgusted me since he had a wedding ring on. 

We came back the next time we were in Vegas hoping he wouldn't be there which he wasn't, thank God! Yet we ended up with the same problem. The bar was practically empty yet me and my husband waited fifteen minutes for a drink because the bartender was to busy flirting with two girls sitting at the bar. Every time this one girl took a sip of her drink he would pour a little more wine in. Then when he finally got to us all I asked for was a malibu and coke and he somehow screwed it up and I couldn't get his attention again to tell him so I had to go to another section of the bar to tell another bartender.

Sorry I know I am rambling on but I have been to a lot of bars in my life and have never been so angry by the service of a bartender. I use to love this place but I highly doubt I will ever go back because the bartenders care more about getting girls than keeping customers happy."}
{"text":"Our party ordered 3 burgers, two medium, one well. All came well done. They were all very dry and bland. Not one of us enjoyed the meal. Service was slow and no apologies given for the slow service and sub par food. We had to ask for Mayo 3 times before it came to our table to help mask the dryness of their $20 burger."}
{"text":"Best thing about the place was the giant TV screen so I could watch the Eagles while in Vegas.  Food was very fair and overpriced.  Maybe the food tastes better if you're drinking a lot.  Wouldn't recommend the place."}
{"text":"Went for early dinner on a Monday, as my kids were hungry and kids eat free on Mondays. The hostesses seemed to be hanging out and after reading reviews I was sure I was in for horrible service. Got seated very quickly though and our waitress was over in less than 2 min to get our drink order. The whole meal service was great, she wasn't bothering us every 10 seconds but made sure to check everything was ok or if we wanted refills. A man came over in plain clothes and asked if everything was ok, we said yes. A few minutes later he snuck up behind me and grabbed my empty cup and asked if my waitress was getting me another beer, I informed him I didn't want one. I assume he was a manager but he should have said something or a name tag would have been nice. Overall good food, and good service.  
Oh, and happy hour is long there 11am -7pm Monday- Friday."}
{"text":"I hate this place! The service was ok. The food came out an hour later and half of it was cold and the other half came out overcooked or burnt, and just wrong.  And even if it was cooked right, it would've been mediocre at best taste-wise. Save your money and go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"I have only been here to dance and if there was a live band on the whole time I would give this place 5 stars. That being said this place does have a decent dance floor and a good crowd. This particular TK's has a horrible dj named bizarre. I requested a song to which he replied \"I don't know that song I don't like country.\" That becomes more clear as he mixes hip hop beats with country songs. I have been here several times and if there had ever been a different dj I wouldn't write this. It seems as this dj like the bouncers is friends with management. Bizarre needs to go look at your reviews people want more country music!"}
{"text":"Excited to try Toby Keith's for the first time. It was during happy hour which was pretty slow and ended up with horrible, slow service. Bartender walked by without making eye contact numerous times while we waited to order. Finally left and headed for Gordon Biersch to try their happy hour which ended up having Fabulous Service!!"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!

bad service, then a bouncer dumped out our over priced drinks with out warning and when i asked him what the prob was he stood 10' away with his arms crossed starring at me, a friend went to get the manager and at that point him and a couple other guys came over and started to push me out the bar while 5 guys were holding me down a couple sucker punched me another 400lb fat guy was kneeling on my arm for what seemed like 10 mins crushed a nerve and now almost 4 weeks later i still have limited use of my hand and there is a good chance it will be like this for ever!!   I WASNT DRUNK INFACT I WAS DRINKING WATER, i wasn't fighting with anyone, I wasn't harassing anyone, i wasn't acting stupid  ! i was standing by a wall minding my own business and this happen, just imagine if you were drunk or you need help from these guys!!   I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ SOME OF THESE REVIEWS BEFORE GOING HERE!!"}
{"text":"I ate at the bar. Ordered the half rack of rib and shrimp combo. The bartender/waiter was friendly and attentive. However, the food was basic bar food. The Ribs tasted like they were cooked several hours before and warmed up for me. Live music and good drinks helped. In summary, if you want to listen to live country music and have drinks this is a good spot. Just eat before you get there."}
{"text":"Ate here while in Vegas for a seminar. Luckily I was alone as I had to rush back to the room and spend the next half-hour destroying the bathroom. Don't get the ribs. Just, just don't."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant twice during my 5 day stay.  Rhonda was our waitress the first time in and we requested her the second visit.  Pulled pork sandwhich was amazing as were the wings.  Rhonda was on top of everything and great with the recommendations as we are an indecisive group.  If you visit this location be sure to request her."}
{"text":"So I'd heard a lot of advertising for this place (Toby Keith's in Peoria), so a group of friends went to check it out...Well apperently the the bouncers/security staff run this ridiculous joke of a bar...and the management just allows them run free to just shit all over their customers for no apparent reason, other than one of my friends danced with one of the bouncers girlfriends... Well good luck w that, guess we'll spend our money elsewhere!!!!  

Asshole bouncers, lack of professionalism and poor management! 

Toby Kieth's, now we all just HATE this Bar & Grill!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible location. Scantily clad waitresses. Slow service. Food was alright but way overpriced (but I guess that's the Vegas theme.) It was trying to be country music's version of Hard Rock Cafe except everything was Toby Keith this, Toby Keith that, for obvious reasons. The longer I sat there, the more I thought Toby Keith was a douchebag for having restaurants focused on himself."}
{"text":"Went to Toby Keiths 10/17 and was shocked by the total disregard for customer service, picture this... we're in Vegas with friends and decide to meet up for our final dinner of the weekend, cuz it's tme to go home. We meet our friends at this place and find our friends seated at booth and sit at a table right next to them,  (note there are several empty tables around us) the waitress (Asian female, didn't get her name) completely ignores us and doesn't ask if we'd like to order anything.  When we get tired of being ignored we politely ask if we can \"Order\" a drink and she asks if want water (In a sarcastic tone)!!!  When we say no, we actually want to order a drink that costs MONEY, she asks if the \"maitre D\" sat us there.  
I explained the situation above to her and in a snotty way she says she has to go ask the manager if we can be served!! WTF??!!!  So after making us feel like we're F' N beggars in this P.O.S joint, I go up front and ask to speak to the manager, I explain the situation to the sad excuse for a manager and he proceeds to look at me sarcastically and starts to side with this broad!!!  So I explain to him that he is in V-E-G-A-S and that people are coming there to spend their hard earned money and should at least get a little bit of courtesy and respect but he couldn't hear me because obviously the guy doesn't have a clue, as to what customer service is.  

Mr. Toby Keith should send this moron SIMS or whatever his name is, to work in the collections department or bathroom because he has NO CLUE as to what SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY OR ANY HOSPITALITY IS!!!!  VEGAS has waaaay to many choices of places to go, I recommend you all go somewhere you'll be treated with RESPECT and are made to feel welcome!!"}
{"text":"We were there mid to later afternoon on a weekday and while it was busy it was a short wait.  Staff were all very friendly and attentive without being obnoxiously intrusive.   We had basic burgers and fries which were good.  The drinks were fantastic!   Generous pours and to-go cups!  Would love to go back in the evening and experience the rest of what Toby Keith's has to offer."}
{"text":"Well worth coming here when your in Vegas.  Since the food in Vegas is spotty at best, or it's way overpriced.  Not here, If you like BBQ and good home cookin food, You got to come here, my wife had half a rack of very tasty bbq bacby backs, I had their fried catfish po' boy, very good.  though on the video advertisement, they showed a mechanical bull there. There is none.  But do yourself a favor, stop eating at the overpriced hotel restaurant or deli, and get to Toby's"}
{"text":"We were really hungry last night, saw this place and figured it would be ok.  My husband and I were surprised.  I never had catfish before.....delicious!  Hubby's 2 fried chicken breasts.....MOIST, fantastic flavor!  Neither of us listen to country music.  Have no clue as to Toby Keith's connection to restaurants ( other than selling his name).  Just know that we had a delicious meal.  :-D"}
{"text":"The service was good and it seemed like a fun atmosphere, salad was good but chicken tenders were awful, no flavor tasted like frozen breaded chicken.  Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My sister and I always have an amazing time here--have probably been there 20 times. We stay at Harrahs mainly because of this bar. I am a Toby Keith fan though, so I guess I AM biased. The bartenders are all really friendly and fun. The crowd is happy and cheerful. We were there this weekend and got free concert tickets and all access wrist bands for TOBY!!!! It was amazing!

Now, food wise, I like the Shrimp dinner its super yummy, the Mac n cheese is really good too. The quesadilla is good too.  The will modify foods to suit your needs, and are happy to do it. I dont really go for the food, though.The drinks are huge and the bartenders have always been really attentive and fast (especially Jimmy:)) They make free shots every so often, and you will get drunk fast. The bartenders are really good at what they do. Tip them well and they will take good carfe of you (they even charged my phone because the battery was dead) I love this place and wish I was there right now.

All in all...If you like Toby and like to drink from a mason jar, I recommend this place. If you want to have crazy country fun, I recommend this place. If your old or  if your yound young, they dont discriminate, I recommend this place. But, dont come here expecting gourmet foods or any fancy crap because you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"We go here every year and are never disappointed.  Love the huge margaritas in mason jars!  The meatloaf, country fried steak, and fried baloney are always good!  This year we tried a deep fried twinkie.  Not exactly my taste, but after a mason jar filled with margaritas, everything tastes good!"}
{"text":"I always try and keep an open mind when going to dine at a Strip location, I know that the bulk of their business is tourists and that the prices might be a little high because of it but there is no excuse for any restaurant in a major name like Harrah's to not offer any LOCALS ONLY deals or discounts!  On to the positive because I really hate having to write anything negative unless I think it will really help someone else.  The food here has always been good, I've never ordered something and wished I hadn't, but to be fair I seem to wind up ordering the fried bologna sandwich every single time!  I guess it's a guilty pleasure, 15 bucks for a bologna sandwich is kinda steep though don't ya think?  I mean Bologna is the cheapest lunchmeat you can buy at the deli counter isn't it?!?

The beer here is the normal mix of stuff.. I remember really liking getting my mason jar full of Miller Lite in the past... yeah yeah I know what you're thinking... chubby man orders fried bologna but is worried about the calories in his BEER! ... I just like the taste of it dammit, I'm sure as hell not dieting!   But alas I've got another complaint, I ordered a miller lite draft and it says right on the menu $6 and when I ordered the waitress didn't say anything other than bottle or draft... DRAFT of course, I can drink it out of the bottle at home!   SOOOOO anyway out comes a HUGE mason jar filled with hoppy goodness and it was literally a quart!  So the mrs and I have a conversation about what a good deal that is at a strip-staruant!   Well bill time comes and I got charged $9, still not a bad price considering it was really two pints but FALSE ADVERTISING and the waitress should be clear if there is an extra charge.  I still did not get any satisfaction as to why it was $9 and it says $6 domestic on the menu.  

All in all, I will definitely be back again it just won't be too soon without better pricing or maybe a locals night/special.   ATTENTION MANAGEMENT!  Do the waitresses really need to be walking around with their tan asses hanging out?  I'd be just as happy if they seated me while wearing a burka!"}
{"text":"I read reviews on this place before going but decided to give it a try beings its the only country western place on the west side. The service was horrible!!! No waitresses walking around, 1 came to our table after a half our being there, that was it all night. Band sucked so bad, horrible singing, couldn't understand them. And the DJ when they weren't playing, ugh even worse.  No drink specials. With it being country thunder weekend and not very busy was very disappointed. I miss whiskey river and grahams. Toby should know how bad his bar is being run."}
{"text":"I love this bar!  When I insist my non-country loving friends go, they end up having a blast.  The live entertainment is always a good time and so are the people that go.  The bartenders, except one I'll mention below, are always the friendliest compared to most places I have been. 

Watch out for one bartender in particular.  To give a better image, he looks Asian.  I asked for two mason jars of my favorite - a long beach.  He got caught up talking to others at the bar, which I could care less, except he ended up giving me two cups of the drink.  When I told him again that I wanted mason jars, he rolled his eyes, poured the cups into jars and added a little bit more of whatever they put in, slammed the jars on the counter, and told me \"$50.\"  I'm not the type to throw a fit, so after paying $44 all weekend, I paid the $50 and still tipped him pretty good.  I was disappointed that my drink tasted like pink lemonade more than how they usually make it, but like I said, I was having fun and didn't want to fuss in public.  I figured I'd let the world know his customer service skills instead of him himself.

Either way, I'll go back every time!"}
{"text":"Horrible!! Got there and hostess forgot to Add us to the wait list! Server was a total bitch! She was irritated when I asked for a different drink because the drink I had tasted old   She ROLLED her eyes and then when we asked for a manager some guy walks up and doesn't introduce himself and acts irritated  would not recommend this place ever and will never go back!!! Not worth wasting your time for! After 45 minutes of waiting for food we asked for to go bags Nd took our nasty tasting food with us! Threw most of it out!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would, place SUCKS! Friend called a week in advance to reserve for a party of 20, called twice during week including sat, was told all good. Get there sat. NOTHING, the manager was RUDE and could care less about helping us even though people in big groups were being helped after us. NEVER EVER AGAIN, go to BJ's or taps or even the dive bar down the street like we did, WAY TO EXPENSIVE!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice: our first and last time ;)
One star ONLY because I enjoyed sitting near the dance floor where the big screen shows new and old music videos, and because their tea is served in large mason jars. I'm a sucker for mason jars. 
A-The hostess sets the tone for disappointment (we had only half of our party there so they wouldn't seat us without the rest of them; we four decided to sit without them because we were hungry.) When the other five arrived, a friend asked to sit close to us and the hostess said, \"I know your friends are over there so you can't sit there.\"
B-the food was a major disappointment! Between chicken fried steak, quesadillas, seafood and chicken, something should at least be tasteful! Our food was bland at best--my kid makes better mac n cheese!
C-The sweet tea...I tell ya if you go back to the kitchen, when they finish stirring in the sugar, the spoon sticks straight up!!"}
{"text":"We went here for an early dinner around 4pm on a week night so it was slow. The hostess seemed irritated that we interrupted her conversation with her coworkers to seat us. Once she showed us to our table she threw the menus on the table (literally) and walked away. As we sat there the overly loud band was doing a sound check and we couldn't hear each other talk. There was no separation between the bar and \"restaurant\".  We were never greeted by a server or asked if we would like a drink. We walked out pretty quickly and I am fairly confident in saying that we will never return to this place."}
{"text":"I like this place! I have not had any issue with the food yet. The service is okay could be better it's hit or miss depending on the time of day.  They have a pretty good two for $25 menu! If you love country music this place could be a good one for you. I like that it is not overcrowded with a bunch of drunk people.. I definitely have been there a few times and plan on returning."}
{"text":"Literally the worst bar I've ever been to in Vegas.  The bartenders are slow and indifferent.  The back bar is filthy.  We ordered food and they dropped a pile of plates and flatware in the middle of our table.   As I write this review I am waiting for a beer watching these goofs meander around aimlessly behind the bar.  It is a shame because the band is great.  The place is nearly empty...I assume because the service is so god awful."}
{"text":"Please believe the reviews about security you read on here. They are awful. 2nd time that they have come up to my boyfriend asking \"to talk\" outside. FYI, if you are ever asked this, finish your overpriced warm drink because you are not coming back. We hadn't even been there an hour. We were minding our own business, had stools at the bar, no falling/spilling/yelling, just trying to have a good time when my boyfriend was approached to \"talk outside\" by 2 bouncers. I then told my friend with us to finish her drink because he's being kicked out. She's from out of town, totally thought I was being sarcastic, until she realized I was being dead serious. She was beyond floored. Once outside, the bouncers really had no valid reason as to why he was kicked out, but my personal favorite was \"you're a big guy\". Will not be going back ever again and I make it a point to go out of my way and tell everyone I know to never go to this bar. Such arrogant, cocky, frat boys for security. Hopefully this places closes soon and a better bar opens up that actually lets people relax and have a few drinks, and maybe even actually dance! Such a shame because the Mesa location is fabulous."}
{"text":"Have tried this bar once and will go again. Burgers and nachos were good. Beer came in mason jars which fits the theme well. (The jars are deceivingly big - thought I was ready for another and proceeded to struggle finishing it in time for my new one to arrive!) The bar is set up well for live music with a good size stage with floor space in front of it. We caught a great country cover band I believe was named Zona Roads. It's not a fine dining establishment and if you get your expectations in line and stick to the basics like burgers, nachos, fries etc you will have a good time - It's beer and bar food and they do it well. We ate at the bar which seems like the best spot. They just have a handful of booths and then a bunch of low tables otherwise."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this place after eating there only one time...but I must say, I am IN LOVE WITH TOBY KEITH'S!

First, the food:

Amazing. That is how I would describe it. I got the Baby Back Ribs and had the biggest grin on my bbq-covered face as I savored each bite. Never have I eaten something more delicious. I understand how there are plenty of other places YOU might have been that contradict that, and I just may eat at crappy restaurants, but I am serious when I say it was the best Ribs I have ever eaten. I sampled some food from everyone in my party, and everything was absolutely incredible.

Next: the drinks:

I'll keep this short because I only had one drink (and some of others), but their drinks tasted really good. I only ordered at the table and not the bar, but what I had was delicious and I approve.

The atmosphere:

From what I saw, there was the eating area, a bar, a dance floor, and a stage with live music. The place was very loud, and country music was blaring, but it was entertaining. I have no interest in country music whatsoever but I still enjoyed the music and had a great time. There were dancers on some of the tables that were absolutely gorgeous. I was temped to just be a creeper at the bar because of how beautiful the girls were, but then again, that would be creepy :P

Finally, the staff:

I had no issues at all with the staff. We had not made a reservation so we had to wait maybe 30 minutes (but again, there were dancers, so I didn't mind standing around). When the time to be seated finally came, we were placed right near the stage. It was loud so we requested a different table. They quickly accommodated us and moved us closer to the entrance. The waitress then came by and took our orders, and was on point to bring our appetizers/drink refills whenever needed. Our food was prepared very quickly and everyone's order was perfect.

Final verdict?

Like I said before, I have only eaten here once. The one time I was there I had an awesome time. I loved the food, the atmosphere, and everything about the place. I told a friend eating with me that I will come back every time I am in vegas, and that I must bring my family there. The food was top notch and the service was great. I highly recommend Toby Keith's and hope you have the same excellent service that I did."}
{"text":"The wait was so long.  The wait was like seriously long.   The wait was tremendously long.  ...AND THEY WERE NOT BUSY!  We finally got seated and no one ever came to even offer us water after another long wait. Soooooo we left.  Sorry its no food review cause we never got to eat that."}
{"text":"If you are a smoker, you will love this place. All others, stay away!!!!  This is one of the restaurants in Nevada that ignores the clean air act.

The waitresses wear nothing but their underwear, so this place is not for kids.  They do not warn you about that ahead of time, and there are lots of people that bring in their kids and then try to shield their eyes."}
{"text":"Bad service. Burger terrible. Wrong order. Main meal came out before appetizer. Sorry but never going back again. Server didn't even care we did not eat our food and the check had items we did not get."}
{"text":"My sister food was good. She had chicken and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes where not mixed all the way. My food the American buger  had to be sent back as it was to pink. When it came back it didn't have all the fixings on it. I also ran out of beer. My sister never got to see a drink menu. The Manger did come over and took care of my part of the bill. Over all shity service and I have been here before. I won't be back here at all. Toby Keith needs to get a handle on this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 7 year anniversary and the only pace she wanted to go was Toby Keith's bar.  Huge Huge disappointment.  The burger was just ok, her chicken was ok and we were very disappointed.  There is a Toby Keith's Bar just outside of Chicago and it is 10xs better.  Spend your time to eat somewhere else and just go there for drinks after.  It was a Saturday and College Football was on so no music was playing.  Beware if you want music and sports games are on."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have never written a review ever in my life. This is my first review, but I felt it was needed just because my experience was so bad. I am a 13 year military vet that does not go out too often. 

My co-workers decided to have a social event at this bar, I did not know where this place was located so I looked it up here on Yelp, and I saw a lot of bad comments about bad customer service and the bouncers being extremely rude. Despite all the reviews I read, I decided to go just so i can support our event. I did not have my first beer until about 2 hours into the night, just so I can get the people home that might need assistance afterwards. We also had pre-planned designated drivers to take all of us home after the event. The group I was with was having a good time and was dancing a lot. As I was walking to go check on one of my personnel that was dancing, two bouncers stopped me and asked \"can I see your ID\". After recalling the reviews I read, I knew this was something the bouncers felt they had the right to do, even though I had a white ban that said I was over 21. I told them \"no you can not, I know you have no right to randomly ask me that\". So they told me I need to follow them outside and I complied without a single argument. When we got outside they said specifically they did not like the way I was walking and asked me how long I have been at the bar. I said no disrespect, but they are out of line at that is none of their business, but I still told them I was there for just over 3 hours. Also I told them \"I know I was not stumbling because I only had a beer and a half within a little over 3 hours and I saw many people that were far more worst than me\". They responded with \"I gave them attitude about wanted to see my ID\". I said \"not to sound to disrespectful, but I know they have no right to just randomly request my ID\". They demanded I do their sobriety test. I told them I know you have know right or jurisdiction to give me such a test, but I will still do it. Then they gave me some made up test where I had to count to 1, 2, 3, 4 and follow a particular finger pattern that they felt was suitable. I told them I'm probably not going to get this because it was totally made up and it was based off of a pattern the bouncer felt was suitable. Of course I did not get it because it was totally made up by the bouncers. I requested their names because I knew this was a previous issue based off of the reviews I read and I asked to speak to their supervisor. The bouncers names were Jesse and Mike, and they did not want any part of what I had to say. As we were talking, their \"manager\" came out, and said \"what do you want\"? He came out trying to posture up and act all hard, but he was not trying to give me his name when I requested it. All I can describe him to be is a white oriented guy that was roughly 5'6\" that had a shaved head. He did not care to hear a single word I had and just took the bouncers point of view and told me to leave. Even though I was the one who requested him, that did not mean anything to him.  So I just left extremely upset, without another word. I was extremely bothered because I was someone who was just randomly singled out without much of an explanation.  I ask the bouncers, can I at least go get my party, and they just looked away from me and ignored me. We spent over $500 on food and drinks and this is how we get treated.

To Management:
Based off of all the reviews you see here on Yelp, it's obvious that your night crew has problems and it does not look like you are doing much about it. Their attitudes can only be a reflection of the people who lead them. Also, your crew at night does not seem to realize that your establishment is a bar and it's sole purpose is to serve alcohol. So even if someone started to get a little bit buzzed, so what! Unless they can not stand, are bothering other people, or puking all over the place, just leave them alone."}
{"text":"No-no to plastic cups!

Receives one LOUSY star because I had to with Yelp. 

We visited on a Sunday around 1:00 PM and the place only had about three dozen customers max. We asked the waitress for two waters and two beers, one pint and one large. We also ordered two apps, potato skins w/o bacon and fried pickles. The beer took about ten minutes and was served in plastic cups. PLASTIC! Who even does that? 

We complained to the sever, Stephanie, and she told us because it was Saturday the night before that the bartenders were lazy and glasses were sparse. She did offer to pour our beer into glasses, but not a re-pour it from the tap. 

We waited twenty minutes for the appetizers and water. Those never showed so we threw $20 on the table and walked out. This is one place that I'll never go to again. We went to the Kilt which had max capacity of well over 100 people and we had two beers AND water within two minutes. The beer was served in GLASSES, like it should be. Always."}
{"text":"We came here looking for a good Burger, that was recommended to us. I had the \"Old West\" it was a BBQ Bacon Burger and it was very good but if you're looking for chicken my gf had the \"She's a hottie\" it was a Buffalo fried chicken wrap and that was awesome. The service was decent had to falg someone down for refills but hey we're in Vegas it's always busy. Definitely a place to come back to."}
{"text":"Could have been so much better. Prices were not unreasonable for strip . Good was average, drinks were exceptional!  They could at least turn up the music.  A little disappointed ."}
{"text":"This place is a dump.  We had the misfortune of sitting at the bar and having to look at the food, trash, rags, and dirt on the floor behind it.  If the bar is this bad, I can only imagine how clean the kitchen is.  

The service was terrible.  The bartenders were rude and spent more time talking trash about customers than serving them."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service.  We had a minor issue with our order but the waitress and manager handled it extremely well.  We have not experienced service this good in years."}
{"text":"Went at 1:05 am and was told they were closed. Turned away disappointed that information was wr I ng and that the get apparently closed early."}
{"text":"Went in after finals to have some drinks and listen to some music. We were really hoping for some food, but I guess after 10 on a Friday night is just way too late. So we got some drinks, which were oddly expensive. $7.50 for well drinks? Come on. 

But the absolute best part of the night was when our two male friends started dancing with each other and were immediately pulled outside by the bouncers to be interrogated about what state they were from, how much they had to drink (none at this bar, thankfully), and were then told in a less than subtle manner that they needed to leave. 

Considering how raunchy some of their other straight patrons were getting with their dancing, I can really draw only one conclusion as to why two men were asked to leave, just for dancing together and nothing else. So thank you Toby Keiths. Thank you for re-enforcing everything I knew about Toby Keith and Arizona in general."}
{"text":"We went there 9/17/15 for dinner and the food and service were excellent. I had a bacon cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon and fried onions, it was great. Their drinks are a good deal too, same price as other restaurants but not watered down. I make sure to eat here every time I come to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Took my mother here for her birthday dinner, being that she is a huge country fan !  We already had mixed feelings because people have warned us about the crappy service and looooooong waits on everything from seating to getting your meal to getting your bill AND waiting to sign the bill!  They had plenty of staff on hand, and open tables because we went around 5p, we waited 30 mins for a table., when we got sat we waited another 30-40 mins just to put in our order then waited another hour or so for our dinner, after all that wait by the way, the food wasn't worth it at all.  We ended up leaving the place till after 830p because the waitress got our bill wrong and after talking to a manager it took 3 tries to get our bill corrected.  It was an horrible experience!"}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely delicious! We were delightfully surprised at how good it was! It was our best meal in Vegas this trip. The server was also super friendly and helpful. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great service, awesome food and fantastic drinks! Go-Go dancers on the bars on Fridays & Saturdays from 10pm-2am! Remember to tip your servers, bartenders, and your dancers! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Especially the fries but terrible service. Ruined the birthday dinner we went there for. Took forever to get extra plates, drinks, food, everything! Dont remember the last time ive had such poor service. Such a disappointment. Either they need new mgmt or mgmt needs to do something"}
{"text":"Worst bar ever. Extremely rude, sexist, and slow. Bartenders don't pay any attention to you, takes 20 minutes to get an overpriced drink. Two of my friends think they got drugged there after only having 1 or 2 drinks (neither had experienced this before). A girl tried to fight my friend, had her hands put on her, told security and they told her that they were closing soon so to not worry about it and did nothing. They took away my boyfriends REAL ID saying it wasn't him, we told them to get the police to verify it and another doorman said, \"If he took it, you're not getting it back.\" We got the manager and after one look he gave it back. This bar is full of arrogant frat boys running it. And if you want to get into the aesthetics of the bar itself, it is much to bright inside, drinks are dropped and spilt all over the floor. I've only gone 3 times because I wanted to give it another chance after the first bad experience. I've only heard horror stories other than that."}
{"text":"We got to Toby Keith's @ 4:45 pm and asked for a booth. We were told that they could not seat us in a booth until 5:00 pm. So we stood there and waited for just over 15 minutes. At a few minutes after 5, we asked if we could be seated. The receptionist told us that she could not seat us because the server was not there yet. We spoke with the manager, Melissa and asked her if we could just sit in a booth with menus & water & wait for the server to show up. The manager of the restaurant said that we could not be seated in any of the vacant booths (they were all vacant) until the tardy server arrived. We said ok, and left. Pathetic customer service. We went to Flour & Barley & had great pizza."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on our wedding anniversary. There was a live country band playing and lots of people line dancing and having a great time.  Great drink specials and a good western vibe. We couldn't help but notice the excessive number of bouncers that walks back and forth on the dance floor as if they were making sure everyone is on their best behavior.  It almost seems like something is about to go down. I mean these muscle head bouncers had necks starting at the top of their ears. Hey Toby, Its a bar dude not downtown Beirut"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. Horrible (read NO) service, overpriced and just a bad experience. 

We stat at at table at the end of the bar, no one ever came to the table while we were there for an hour. We stood at the self service station at the end of the bar for 15 minutes. One beer and 3 cocktails (nothing out of the ordinary) was $50. The bartender was an arrogant ass. 

Lots of other options in Vegas...skip this bar."}
{"text":"This place was great. Band playing was good and played for a while. Had drink special $15 all u can drink for ladies. Not very big but wasn't terribly crowded. Plenty of room to dance"}
{"text":"Uhhhhhh 9pm band on a Saturday night has yet to be seen at 915pm. Tick tock. About to leave. Slow bartenders. Good thing there was no cover.  Luckily they have super upbeat music to hold us over...oh wait...another slow song. ZzzzzzzzzzzzzZzzzzzzzzzzzzzZzzzzzzzzzzzzz"}
{"text":"I ate there last Thursday night. Had the American burger which was pretty good (Not amazing). Also stayed around for ladies night, there was a decent crowd. Overall good experience would go there again. Bouncers are a little sketchy tho, asking me what my birthday and address was as he's IDing me. Taking there job a little to serious I think."}
{"text":"Service was good, waitress was friendly and attentive. The side potatoes salad was horribly bland while the other main entrees were adequate. 

I honestly would recommend the Ellis Island restaurant (especially considering the price). Perhaps this restaurant may be worth it at night when the band is playing, but otherwise it should be avoided."}
{"text":"Super slow! Took two hours for dinner and we arrived at 4:30. Took 30 minutes to bring me water and only after I asked her twice. Messed up my drink order 3 times and never got it right. Sticky floors. Several of the servers acted snotty with our requests. The hostess was rude when we asked to sit at a booth and she told us the booth was for parties bigger than ours (we had six). When we left, a party of four was in the booth! Took nearly 30 minutes to run our check! What happened to service with a smile? Go to Sandbar next door for better service, better drinks and a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really bad place very rude staff did not like the dancers on the bar. Can't dance no room to small have to watch out for the other dancers that are tossing the girls in the air or throwing them between there legs. High price place not worth it!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worse service ever. Mandy is an awful manager!! If I could give this zero stars I would, she and her bartender had such an attitude and had no manager experience previously, you could definitely tell!!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good & the price was reasonable, especially for Vegas. The atmosphere is great. TVs for sport enthusiasts & music for others. I would have given 5 stars but the service was subpar. The waitress kept forgetting to bring items we asked for. 10 mins for a beer on a slow night??? NO GO"}
{"text":"Better than diner food. Not a fine dining restaurant. Fried catfish was tasty. Home style cooking. The server was good. Time to get the meal after the order taken was a bit slow. 
Watch their drink prices. A friend ordered a peach something drink and it was $19.00. (That's crazy). Ask the price before you order. Some nights they have live music."}
{"text":"I had been here before and thought it would be fun to take a big group for my birthday.  BIG MISTAKE!!!!  It was the worse experience I've ever had.  

I had called a week before to make a reservation for 12, because their website said they recommend reservations for 12 or more.  However, I talked to the manager and she said, they wouldn't be taking reservations because that weekend because of March madness and her suggestion was to come an hour early and put my name on a list.  So, I did just that, however, I was told by the hostess that she couldn't hold a table for me or seat me until all of my party is there.  Wish the manager would have told me that when I called.  No communication between management and staff and that's why they get poor ratings.  

Basically, if you're going to have a large party in your group, call ahead of time and get details of reservations, seating requirements, etc. before you arrive.  

It was a frustrating experience and I won't go there again with a large party."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my girlfriends during my bachelorette weekend because one claimed it was a really fun spot.  We were up at the bar trying to decide what to drink and the bartender was getting so annoyed with us he started throwing napkins at us and slamming down his drink mixer on the bar. So sorry - the bar wasn't even busy - it's not like we were taking up space from customers who were waiting to order a drink.

I've never experienced such a rude bartender in my entire life - I guess I shouldn't expect much from something associated with Toby Keith. yuck."}
{"text":"Food is good. Beer is good. But f$&k sake, the bartenders are slow as shit, we sat at the bar and waited 10 min for someone to come serve us. And it was NOT busy. They saw us but just didn't want to help. Finally I had to basically flag them down by tackling one. Then they just gave us drinks, no menus. Had to wait again for that. They are all just either REALLY REALLY bad at their job or all assholes. It bartending, not rocket surgery. And it's not one or two, it's all of them. So you would think that maybe the manager or assistant manager would be helpful or do something? Nope. One just followed a not very pretty waitress around all night, can't wait to hear about that sexual harassment lawsuit and the other just aimlessly wandered around while everyone just sat there talking. This would be an awesome place to hang out and drink if anyone else worked there, like literally anyone, hell just one person could do the work of every other bartender or manager there. Really wish TK corporate would know about this place giving them a bad name."}
{"text":"Each time I go back, I like it less and less. Service is slow but I can deal with that. The (already understaffed bar) bartender is always too busy flirting with someone to notice we need something without having to flag them down but whatever, the beer is cheap enough. However, tonight marked a new low, one if which I probably won't return.
 New menu: small portions, same price and changed recipes (chicken strips, pretzel now in small bites). I ordered a burger but was told to substitute the fries with anything else is $4. Yes, $4!! My husband ordered the pretzel but asked of they would omit the mustard but give him an extra cheese instead. We were informed this would be a charge as well.  Even the bartender mentioned how asked annoyed the staff is with the menu changes. It's certainly not the servers fault but now this bar has nothing except cheap beer going for it. 
We'll take the drive to Applebee's from now on."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were vacationing in Vegas this weekend and decided to try Toby Keith's because we love the one in Chicago so much. This was one of the worst dining experiences we ever had.

We were seated right away but waited close to 15 minutes before anyone arrived to take our order. Because of this we put in our drink and food order right away. It took another 25 minutes for our food to come out as others, who were seated after us, were being served.

The grilled chicken wrap had very little chicken but was overflowing with lettuce. There was no avocado as the menu had said and was way too creamy.

The hamburger my girlfriend ordered tasted like a frozen hamburger patty and was unusually sloppy. She also ordered fries with an extra side of coleslaw. She was only served the coleslaw and then the server tried to charge us extra for it.

Overall it was a horrible experience. Its unfortunate as we know other Toby Keith locations to have good food and service. If you're ever in Chicago (specifically Rosemont) check out that location."}
{"text":"Fun place!  Food was great and the portions are huge.  We had the steak sandwich, wings and fried pickles. The steak was perfectly med rare.  They really give you a lot of steak.  I didn't have any wings but they looked meaty and my hubby devoured them. Fried pickles are huge wedge cuts and just ridiculous.  I mean it's a fried pickle.  Service was great!  Our server was so attentive, she dropped off extra ranch for my hubby when he got low.  After our meal, we hung out at the bar doing fire ball shots while watching the band.  Yea it a tourist trap but we still had a really great time."}
{"text":"No cover charge, a decent cover band, $5.00 beer served in large mason jars, random free shots of random liquor and girls dancing on the dance floor makes this bar a great place to stop by when you're ready to escape the crowds and slot machines. The place was fun, laid back and not an ultra lounge!"}
{"text":"The active duty military are treated to a free burger and beer. The food is great and reasonably priced. The wings are full sized. The band is live. Cash Presley is here for the week. Great vibe. We have been twice and going back tonight for more dancing."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a 40th birthday party. Band was good. Had two gift cards when we arrived, asked the girl at the front door to let me know how much was on each, I knew one was unused and had $50, I was unsure about the other. 4 people and 15 minutes later no one knew how to check the balance on the gift card, gave up since it was delaying our night. We had to go to the bar to get drinks even though we had a table near the stage - no server. The first time at the bar my husband was helped by a nice lady that used the $16 on our first gift card then put the remaining couple dollars from our $50 gift card. meaning it had about $48. Then next round my husband went to the bar, was finally helped by a guy, he ordered the same as the first time, gave the guy the card and he brought the drinks said there was nothing left on the card then proceeded to avoid my husband by going to the other end of the bar. Finally the first lady that helped my husband came back and he told her the situation. She went and got his card, came back saying it had $32 still available on it. The guy tried to steal our gift card! After the drama at the front door and no one being able to check a balance on a gift card it's hard not to wonder if there is only the one crocked guy or if there is more of a conspiracy going on. Anyway it put a damper on our 40th birthday situation and we left soon after. Completely untrustworthy employees there, it's such a shame with a name like Toby Keith behind it. We used to frequent one of the California locations often when we lived there but we won't be going back to this Peoria AZ one, even thought it's only five minutes from our house."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Staff was very unhelpful, wouldn't seat our group because not everyone was going to be ordering a full meal. Made us move when we sat in the bar. Made everyone come to the bar to place their orders, never got any help from a waiter or waitress."}
{"text":"Being a chain and themed restaurant, our expectations were quite low when deciding on this place for lunch.  Needless to say, we were quite surprised and those expectations were quickly shattered.  Great food!  Highly recommend the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Went to this bar/restaurant while visiting Vegas to watch the steelers/chiefs playoff game. Food and drinks were overpriced and nothing to write home about. Service was terrible. They advertise themselves as a sports bar, but to our surprise the waitress (under the direction of her manager) tried to kick us out after being there for an hour and a half. We were still purchasing drinks (or attempting to, but the waitress stopped coming to our table) and still eating our food, as we ordered appetizers first and then our entrees. I could understand the restaurant trying to get rid of our table if we were simply sitting there for hours sipping on water and not spending more money, but it was quite the opposite. The manager (Haley) came to our table when asked and was very rude and had no explanation as to why this was happening. Do not go here for a sporting event if you plan to watch the whole game.  This is not advertised anywhere on their website."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife because I received a gift card from my work, needless to say I'm glad I didn't actually pay out of my own pocket. I ordered chicken fried steak,  it was frozen and had brown gravy from a mix or a can; if I'm going to eat chicken fried steak I want country gravy. My wife had the brisket sandwich, it was on toast which became soggy because it was drowned in bottled bbq sauce; (my homemade bbq sauce is WAY better than their's hands down and I'll guarantee that). The only thing that was good was the fried pickles. We won't be back. Want a good bbq sauce? You're customers would agree mine is better, you seriously need a better sauce."}
{"text":"Love this bar!! Always have to stop here when I visit Vegas! Makes for a great night! Awesome bands and music and the bartenders are the best!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late dinner around 10pm, ordered a steak, baked potato and mac and cheese. The drink comes in a glass mason jar and almost slipped out of my hand several times. The flavor was great though. My meal came out relatively quick. The steak was okay, the baked potato was okay, but the peel was dry, which might have been caused by the time, it was late. The mac and cheese was not very good. They spent 30 minutes trying to get the charge to go through on my room. I was on hold myself with the hotels front desk. I couldn't leave the restaurant without getting the charge to go through. At first, the band was playing music that was very irritating to me and I was hoping they were finishing soon.  Later on, they started playing some good music and it was actually enjoyable. The overall experience was about a 2 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was the 3rd time going here.  The first time was right after they opened, service was horrible, we waited 45 minutes after we ordered our food for the waitress to come back, but we got no food and no waitress, so we just left.  The second time was a couple of months ago, we were a table of 2 and there were maybe 8 people in the whole place.  That time the appetizer and service was ok.  The last time was on April 30th (a Thursday) at 5pm.  We had a group of 14 people. I won't speak of the other people's experience, mine alone is enough for you to get the idea. My husband ordered a Blue Moon with a slice of orange.  When the bartender brought it out she set it in front of him and said \"We don't have any oranges\" and left.  I would think she would offer him something else maybe? but no.  The second issue was the food.  We ordered the sampler appetizer platter and my husband ordered the chicken wings.  The chicken wings in our platter and his were cold.  I'm not talking room temp, they were just taken out of the fridge and thrown on the plate, not even a bit of warmth.  The \"beer\" cheese dip for the pretzels was nacho cheese sauce. After having waited for 30 minutes to get this \"food\" it was hard to stop my 11 and 15 year old from just eating it.  I wanted to wait for the waitress to come back (since my ice tea and their sodas were long gone) so we could tell her to take it back, but I waited at least 10 minutes and no waitress, so they ate them anyways.  The third issue was my husbands second beer.  He asked for one, I reminded the waitress he asked for one, and I told another waitress walking by he needed another beer.  His wings were there but he had nothing to drink during his entire meal.  He finished my son's soda and went to the restroom.  We were now waiting for the check.  Finally, at least 30 minutes later, a bartender brings the beer.  I told her forget it, take it back, we're getting ready to leave now.  Her response was our tap ran out.  Why didn't one of the 3 waitresses we ask tell us this?  Maybe offer him a different brand? Or a glass of water?  The waitress we had was very condescending, acting the entire time like she was so much better than we were (I was watching the way she treated my parents and my Uncle).  Just very rude.  I left a $3 tip with the 3 issues I just posted on the back of the receipt. The response from the management on all these complaints are the same, let us know, blah blah blah.  Why don't you make a change in your business?  I will not ever go here again, apparently the attitudes of the employees is the attitude of management, rude and uncaring."}
{"text":"Nice attraction, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything else other than the bar area and to check the box of having seen it. Only reason I went was because of a colleague wanting to desperately to go to it. 

Location:
The Bar and Grill is located in the dark depths of Harrahs. For Vegas, this is an indicator for a bottom tier restaurant. The patrons attracted to this locale are often those that are above mid 40s, Harrahs itself is like a retirement community so it comes off as no surprise. 

Menu:
The food menu consists of anything but save a few healthy options, salads are the only choice. Other than the salads, you can tell in the quality and portions of food why obesity runs rampant in America. The food is everything that can almost be thought of when you think of a southern dive bar. 

Beverages:
The choices of beverage is limited in beer, but the cocktails make up what is lacking in the frothy pours. Cocktails are a little new concoction and a little twisted oldies. Depending on the bartender, the bar can make drinks to ones specification."}
{"text":"We went with excitement that the food was going to be good....what a disappointment!!!! 
Service was HORRIBLE, waitresses walking up and down the restaurant looking lost. Our waitress took our order and we got 4 out of 5 dishes wrong! My brother ordered fries with his meal and got \"mash potatoes \"terrible!!!! They looked like a pile of mushy sticky paste! And they tasted even worst!. I ordered habanero/bbq chicken wings...they were friend beyond dry and done and the sauces were on the SIDE!!! I asked why weren't they mixed with the sauce...and waitress had no answer! My other niece ordered a side of chili and they were terrible! They tasted like canned beans except that they were hard and no seasoning and  totally plain and tasteless!!  My other niece's order was brought to her THREE (3) times and each time it was the wrong order! After we ate what we could...(NOT MUCH)  her order was brought and AGAIN IT WAS THE WRONG DISH!!! 
What a horrible and terribly expensive experience! It was expensive and absolutely NOT worth the hype! I DO NOT recommend this restaurant to anybody who is looking for a good meal!
Too bad the managers don't read these reviews and take them serious because I would want my money back! We spend over $150.00! If they want to make up for this service and food they've got my info on yelp!!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming here & we love it! Everytime we come to Vegas it's a must to come here! We love the fried pickles and the mac and cheese balls! Yum!"}
{"text":"I hate country music and don't know the first thing about Toby Keith, so I'll write this review strictly as an objective observer who had a free drink coupon that I had to burn.  It was buy one get one free, so I was locked into this nightmare for about an hour.  Mercifully, since the football game was on, there was no ear-bleed-inducing garbage playing over the sound system, and the bartender was very nice.  These two reasons are the only thing that kept this review in the two star category.  I got a whiskey and coke and the thing was $10.  Ten!  Shit, I mean I know this is Vegas we're talking about, but this is an establishment that serves its beers in mason jars, so what are we talking about, here?  The food looked atrocious and stale, so I went nowhere near it, and I thank God for that decision, because the guy next to me eating nachos looked like he'd just been socked in the gut about five minutes after finishing his plate.  I didn't see the man again.  Needless to say, my visit to this place was short, and if there is any justice in this world, it will not be repeated."}
{"text":"Decided to check it out because the Lady is a fan and I thought at the very least it would be interesting.  When I asked the waitress what kind of beer they had on tap and she said \"Busch.\"  I stared back at her, waiting, hoping to coax another selection out of her, but she was done with her list.  We were in it for the full experience of drinking out of a mason jar, so we were stuck with Busch.

We looked at menu items such as \"Star Spangled Salad\" and \"Knock Yourself Out\" Nachos before settling on the equally healthy fried Mac and Cheese.  The order arrived with four or five large sized brown balls.  They were a little too hot to pick up, so we cut into them with a fork and knife.  The taste was pretty good, but I recommend you share it with someone unless you hate your heart.

During our visit there was a live country band playing as people danced.  The bartenders were up and about doing all sorts of drink pouring tricks the entire time.  It seemed like a place that could get pretty rowdy, but it was very tame that night.  In the end there are places in Vegas that you'll love more than this bar."}
{"text":"Tobey Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill is a great place to go for country music dancing. They had a live band and plenty of space to strut your stuff. The food was decent, very typical American cuisine, and the drink menu looked good, although I didn't try anything myself."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the food and the band was terrible. They didn't even know the correct lyrics to the song. I wouldn't dine here again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Alright so I want to say I was just unlucky and had a bad first experience but this is my experience and I will say that my girlfriend saved this place from a 2 star in my opinion.

I ordered the beer battered fish and chips. The fish that was brought to me was presented well, on top of some delicious fries and fried golden brown...however when I bit into my first piece I was pretty confused...

...what I was tasting was some sort of weird fish flavored paste that stopped me from finishing my meal..DON'T ORDER THE FISH!!!

The atmosphere of this place however was really cool if you're into country and the french fries were great as well as the appetizer of mac and cheese balls!

Our waitress was pretty terrible and paid little to no attention to us..didn't get a refill of water to wash the fish paste out of my mouth.

My girlfriend on the other hand ordered a bleu burger and she said it was really good..so touché Toby Keith's I love This Bar & Grill for delivering me crappy food when you have an arsenal of better options!

I can't stress this enough though..DON'T ORDER THE FISH!!!

Also a bit pricey for a $$ imo. $19 for fish-paste..blehhh"}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of Toby Keith but I can't help liking a place that plays nonstop country music (that said, I can totally understand why someone who doesn't LOVE country music would go a bit nuts here). I also like deep fried things. I came here with a bunch of girls from work who share the same love of all things country music (I grew up line dancing to Brooks and Dunn if that explains ANYTHING... and yes, I know I'm Asian and it's weird). We were here for hours and hours. The music was good, they played all the current country songs and some older stuff too. There was definitely a variety of people here and it is great people watching. My deep fried twinkies were delicious. I think if it were at a bigger casino that I like to frequent more, I would come back more often."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd year in a row my Husband & I have gone to this bar. It's now something we will do each time we visit Vegas. Ts kind of our spot now. We've had a great time each time we've been. We sat at the bar each time. The environment is great, music is great, service is great. Big shout out to the Bartender !¡¡LEO!¡¡ He's awesome. Casually asked him what he  was going to do with a pile of quarters I saw. My son is currently collecting change at school for cancer research. He was so generous gave me the whole pile and my son told me there was another 10.00 inside. You are are great Man Leo my son thanks you!!! Hope to see you next year.

{"text":"Savannah is an excellent bartender. Only reason I'm rating four stars is for poor service before she came on. Very attentive. Took the time to learn my name and drink. Great bartender had an excellent time."}
{"text":"Service is phenomenal.  I also feel its important to note that it is very much appreciated that Mr. Keith ensures his staff takes care of us active duty service members.  True patriot, absolutely awesome. Besides that, food and atmosphere were great."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to this bar but was a little disapointed. Kind of a ego-driven Hard rock type decor.  Enjoyed the music but food was just okay.  We thought it would be fun and kind of honky-tonk but it was just another generic restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this bar and this side of town needs a place like this, but I will never go back.  My friends and I were treated horrible at the door.  They didn't even let us in!  We were a bunch of moms who wanted to listen to some good country music.  We had a driver take us there so none of us were drinking and driving.  We had a beer in the car on the way there(again, not driving). As we were getting out of the car We threw our cups in the trash before going to the door.  The bouncer just looked at me and said you are not getting in.  WHAT?  We weren't being obnoxious at all!  Yes, we were laughing and having fun.  Not a crime.  He just sat there sucking on his lollipop and a horrible attitude saying we can't come in.  I felt we had done something terrible and all we were doing was being responsible and not driving.  Of course our driver had left so we had to wait outside for another one.  We ended up going somewhere else with our money.  And guess what?  We didn't cause a scene or get in a fight or fall down drunk or, etc....  I worked in a bar for many years back in the day and I know there is a lot of responsibility on servers, bartenders, bouncers, etc... but people do go to those places to have fun and yes, drink some cocktails.  But if you have a group of women who are being responsible and would like to spend some money in your place I would think twice before treating them like they were doing something wrong.  Sorry Toby Keith, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced and too much like any other typical burger place. The Las Vegas location was very small in comparison to the Rancho Cucamonga location. The vibe of the Rancho Cucamonga location was much better."}
{"text":"Had the friendliest server and the quickest service of anywhere I've dined on the strip. Got a wrap and fries, both very yummy. Drinks are served in mason jars, which I found adorable.  Live country band playing during dinner/late night which made it hard to chat, but you obviously know you're getting into that when you enter. With as pricey as most places here are for subpar food, Toby Keith's far surpassed my expectations."}
{"text":"I would say its a fun place but similar to everything in Vegas, lets just put somebodys name on it and try to sell some t-shirts.  The food is decent but I've been there once and don't need to go back."}
{"text":"Had eaten and enjoyed Toby Keith's when a restaurant was in Folsom, California so was looking forward to eating at another of these restaurants in Las Vegas. Certainly disappointed. Just wasn't anywhere near as good. From our orders we enjoyed the steak and prawns. The ribs that came with the prawns were dry with limited flavor. Of the sides with dinner, the mashed potatoes were good, very good. The rest of the sides which were the macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and potato salad we're just not tasty in anyway, and only a bite or two were taken from each serving. The place was cold and dark (it was tough to read the menu and we had to use the flashlight on our phones to be able to read), service was decent I guess, and our order was screwed up. Just not a good experience and certainly will not be back."}
{"text":"We went here twice while staying at Harrah's.  The first time was to have some drinks and listen to the band.  The band was excellent, and the drinks were made with generous pours.  They should be, my husband and I had 3 drinks each and he had a shot of JD with Honey,  the bill was $70, a bit pricey in my opinion.  The second time was to eat dinner.  My husband's active duty and got the free burger with fries and a beer, I got the fried catfish.  The food was very good, service was excellent.  I have to knock of a couple of stars for the overpriced drinks and for the price you should get your food served in something better than a wire basket."}
{"text":"I LOATHE this Bar and Grill! This place has provided the worst restaurant experience I have had in all of 2013!

I went with a group of eight people for dinner on a Thursday night. Our waitress didn't seem to understand the difference between import and domestic beers. She made her way around the table taking drink orders, starting with me, then when she got back around she tried to take my drink order again! I calmly told her that I already gave it to her and she just shrugged it off. So after the drinks arrive she asks if we want to order appetizers. She starts taking appetizer orders, again starting with me and guess what? After going around the table she asks what I would like for my appetizer! Not a good sign. 

When she drops off our appetizers she tries taking our menus. Several members of our group told her that we wanted to order dinner. She said \"Ok\" and promptly dashed off! This was another recurring theme with her- she was like the Houdini of wait staff- whenever someone needed a drink or sauce she vanish! 

Now for the food- The one thing that I enjoyed was the cornbread- it was light and not overly sweet. For my appetizer I ordered the fried mac & cheese and it was disappointingly dull. For dinner I ordered the Big bacon and Cheddar - a bacon cheeseburger. I asked for a side of mayo. What came out instead was Miracle Whip- which I can't stand. I don't care if they don't have mayo, but if they're going to try to pass off MW for mayo they shouldn't be in the food service industry. the burger itself was only ok. It was cooked to medium rare as ordered but I could have a much better burger with competent service just a few feet away at Blu Burger Grill. The only positive at this place is the happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"I don't really want to run this place down (as I am a fan of Toby Keith) but....
We have been here three times but it just gets worse. 
This last time the waitress was more elusive than Bigfoot I tried to flag her down but got a\" just a min sir\" . Twenty minutes of that was enough. You can get much better food in the other restaurants nearby.  I wonder what will go into this building after Toby Keith leaves?"}
{"text":"We came by on a Wednesday night specifically to hear the house band-The Tony Marques Band and enjoy a late dinner. The staff went out of their way to accommodate our group going so far as to setting up a table for us in an already closed station near the stage and dance floor so our family had a good view of the stage. Service was very good, our waitress was pleasant and attentive as was the rest of the staff. The food has gotten WAY better since I was last here. My niece had the BBQ Pulled Pork, I had a Fried Bologna Sandwich-minus the miracle whip, my daughter had the BBQ beef sandwich and the boys had the Turkey Bacon Club sandwiches. We were all impressed with how delicious our sandwiches were, much better than when we were here last summer. The boys especially enjoyed the new seasoned steak fries. My husband I have been here a number of times over the past few years, but it was first time bringing the kids-and they had a great time. We used to love this bar...but now we REALLY LOVE this BAR!!  Our family has a new favorite dinner spot for regular visits to Sin City!"}
{"text":"House band was OK.  I ordered a Guiness....which is a little strange I guess in a redneck bar.  The beer cost $8....I gave a $10 and received $12 change.  I wish the casino was like this!  Of course I corrected the mistake.

I didn't order any food because it was 1am or so.  I did see the clientele at this time of night, and I must say it is nothing but older rednecks. I am from Texas...but come on.  Too many old rednecks.  They have their own dancing and mating rituals which I am still not accustomed.  

The main problem with the place is the location.  It is upstairs in a cubby hole.  Difficult to find and just strange.  I do not understand who thought the location was a good idea.  I believe the decision to place the bar in this area went like this:

Harrah's Executive #1: \"So...what do we put in this isolated 'dungeon-like' place?\"
Harrah's Executive #2: \"How about a redneck bar?\"
Harrah's Executive #1: \"What exactly is a redneck bar?\"
Harrah's Executive #2: \"A bar that attracts rednecks.\"
Harrah's Executive #1: \"So how do we attract rednecks?\"
Harrah's Executive #2: \"Get a country singer that likes guns and sings like crap to scribble his name all over it and put some cheesy crap that he touched throughout the place.\"
Harrah's Executive #1: \"So....Toby Keith?\"
Harrah's Executive #2: \"Bingo!\""}
{"text":"Complete disappointment...service was terrible, no music playing and food was just ok. Only positive thing was their Mac & Cheese balls."}
{"text":"Do not even ask me how we ended up here to finish out the bachelorette party - but we did. 

I am *not* a lover of Country music. At all. So this was not exactly my favorite, but the plus side was that there were more than enough empty tables at 1am on a Friday night for our entire group of 15 people to sit down at. 

They've got a country band who I assume does mostly Toby Keith covers (like I know anything about it), but the highlight was when the lead singer donned a crazy shaggy wig and they played Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\" while the audience sang along. That was the best part of being there, in my opinion. 

I didn't order a drink here, but it looked like they served everything in HUGE mason jars (how COUNTRY of them) - so I'd say if you love everything country, you'll probably love this bar & grill even if I didn't. ;)"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times, and each time just gets better, the food is very nice, the beer is served,, of course in a Mason jar.. 
Live band is fun, nice music with a good variety of songs..\

I would recommend here if you love American food and Country Music."}
{"text":"We had planned on eating here prior to our trip because we love country music and had it on the list with Redneck Riviera and Losers. It was oddly empty which was okay because we didn't have to wait. We ordered loaded tater tots and mac & cheese balls. When they arrived we were less than impressed. Their was barely any visible bacon or cheese and MAYBE a teaspoon of sour cream on the \"loaded\" tater tots. The mac & cheese balls were okay but nothing to write home about. We laughed at how large the mason jars were for our sodas were until we received the bill and they were $5 a piece...I'd have rather had a smaller cup for half the price. It was just odd and unexpected I guess. I figured if Toby Keith had his name on something, it'd be food he would expect to get if he sat down."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the worst meals I've ever attempted to have in Vegas. I ordered the fajitas, the meat tasted old and was very chewy. I set it aside after just one bite. My friend ordered the chicken salad wrap, tons of dressing and lettuce, small amount of chicken but the best part was the used lemon wedge that she found inside the wrap after just one bite.  Gross!! The prices were way too expensive for the quality of the food. The manager came over, quietly apologized and removed the items from our bill, but not from the table, and  failed to check back on us or even acknowledge us as we passed him on the way out. Our server was nice but that is about the only good thing I can say about the place."}
{"text":"Make a reservation! We got there around noon without a reservation and the wait was 1 and 1/2 hours or sit at the bar. Luckily we did find a seat and after about 15 mins the bartender gave us a menu. The next time we came around was about 45 mins later. Waited another 15 or so to get our beer and awhile for our food. Overall we were there over 2 hours. The food was decent but they need more servers. The hostess didn't seem to like her job and the bartenders are over worked, 2 bartenders for an entire bar and the area around, plus walk ups! They need at least 4 bartenders easy. Overall not impressed and not worth the wait."}
{"text":"If Toby Keith knew this place operates like a back alley joint, he would never allow his name to be affiliated with it (let's hope not!)  I can't imagine why there is a fee to get in.  The line to get in is very slow moving.  The music  at least is varied to several types of music, so if you are a diehard country fan, forget it! This is not the bar for you!  We reserved a table near the stage.  That cost our group $250.00!  The drinks were watered down, the service was minimal, and to top it all off no food after 10pm!  Are they kidding? Why buy drinks when you can't even eat?  I completed a survey to give this place a chance to address my issues, never a word back.  How's that for tacky?"}
{"text":"Had to try Toby Keith's for a slice of Americana. Menu offerings were plenty to choose from with some country junk food. Beer selection was super weak, no good IPAs or micro brews to speak of. Of course Toby had PBR on tap. Hooters style service with country twist on the uniform - tight jeans. Super cool bar, very large and shaped like a guitar. Food was alright, service was great. Novelty dining, checked off the list.  I guess this would be a great place to see a performance."}
{"text":"Found Toby's by accident had not been there before.  
Our food was great and service was fast.  We will return."}
{"text":"This place was fun! Came for dinner and I ordered the fried bologna sandwich which so so so so GOOD!!! After we enjoyed the live band and watched line dancing. The bar is nice and big, the fireball shots are $7 each though! This was on a Saturday night...that's overpriced....apparently tues or Thursday is ladies night and they have $3 fireball shots or something. I ate, I drank, I danced and will come back again."}
{"text":"Disappointed they didn't play country music, was more a sports bar. Service very was slow! Food was decent and average prices. Probably wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Awesome food, Awesome place to eat - Harland (GM) knows how to make it right and make things happen. This is a must visit place when you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Waitress did not greet table for 10 mins. Food took 30+ mins to come out, table was not checked on in between to let us know of status. Customer service was so-so, could've been a lot better, really liked the gentleman that was going around refilling our waters though. 

I got the sloppy joe, can't mess up on sloppy joe so it was pretty good. A little on the dry side but flavor was there so that made up for it. Received a huge portion of fries which was surprising but made the $14 plate worth it. 

Atmosphere was pretty nice, music was great. Tables could be spread out a little bit more but oh well, it's a casino location it is what it is. 

Not sure if I would return due to service but hopefully others receive a better experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time in this place and was impressed by how big it was but that was about it. There were more workers than customers and still got bad service. I can see by looking at the other reviews it is about the same. Based on staff we should have had our own server since more were there. Now I saw friends of staff come in and  service couldn't be any better for them. Come on really management do you look at your reviews and say ummm maybe there is a problem, guess not. #tobykeith"}
{"text":"I came here twice while in Vegas for the weekend; mostly because I was staying at Harrah's. The first night we went in around 1-2 am and there was a live band playing. The service at the bar was very good and fast - but a 16oz beer is $13.50 which is pretty expensive even for Vegas. The rest of the night was fun, my girlfriend and I danced to the band and had a good time. 

Now the next day was a different experience. We came to get some lunch around 1pm and we were seated quickly and our waitress was friendly and the service was fast. BUT, I ordered the steak sandwich medium-rare and it came out bleeding red. I ate a few bites of the sandwich but that was it - way too bloody to eat any more. The sandwich came with fries but I was so turned off by the sandwich that I barely ate any of those. When the waitress asked how everything was I told her about how the sandwich was way too bloody and she told her manager about it. The manager came over and said \"I heard your steak sandwich was too bloody, is there anything I can do?\" I told her that I hadn't paid my bill yet and so she told me she could discount it. Before she left I asked her if she saw the sandwich and she said no, but \"I talked to the chef and he said that it was way too bloody.\" 

So the chef sent out a sandwich that he knew wasn't cooked correctly, and then the manager only took $3 off of the sandwich/fries meal that was almost $20 and I had only eaten a few bites - after she admitted they messed up the order.  You would assume they would take the item off of the bill, but no. 

To top it all off, I asked for an extra pickle spear because that was the only thing that I actually ate that came with my meal and got charged for it. 


But the beer was cold."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check this out for an early dinner on a Saturday evening and really enjoyed going into Toby Keith's.  I have seen a lot of negative reviews but have to say we did not have an issue with service.  Our waitress was very attentive and I never once had to ask for a refill on a drink.  The food was decent and the atmosphere was decent.  would like to go in for an evening when there is live music and see how that is."}
{"text":"Wait...wait...wait...and more wait. The place has tons of servers, but the service is soooo slow! Our server must have said, \"Sorry about the wait.\" At least 15 times. Took about 10 minutes just for our drinks. Then it took another 5 minutes for her to take our order.  

I ordred the Hottie Burger and my son ordered the Mac and Cheese. Mondays are kids eat free nights. That worked out well. 

After 10-15 minutes of more waiting the server finally felt sorry for us and brought out cornbread to make up for the long wait. Finally about 20 minutes later our food was out. My son digs into his Mac and Cheese and says, \"Eww this is gross.\" Which really surprised me, I tried it, yup pretty gross. I asked him if he wanted something else to which he replied he didn't want to wait again.

My burger that I ordered medium had a yellow flag on it stating it was cooked medium well. Awesome. The burger was fine even if it was medium well. You could really taste the Hatch green chile. Other than that, the only reason I'd return is to have some drinks with friends. Some of the servers are really cute.

Until they work out the long wait times and mediocre food, I won't come back.  The entire experience was literally about an hour and a half. Somewhere Toby Keith is laughing at us all while counting his riches."}
{"text":"Worst fajitas I've ever had, totally bland. Side of rice in a Dixie cup!! 18.00 to share the worst fajitas I've ever had. Zero flavor. My boyfriends brother got the meatloaf, it tasted just like how canned dog food smells. All bad. I didn't like Toby before, now i feel ripped off by him. Highway robbery! It doesn't get worse than sides in Dixie cups, it was similar to convalescent home food, for those on a salt free, spice free diet. this place is a ramshackle."}
{"text":"You can tell they are newly open. I tried to contact a manager about a special event and twice I was told they were in a meeting. They took a message and no one returned my call. Showed up for dinner tonight 60 min prior to my party of 12 so we could get a table big enough. After 30 min I was told the table was ready. The hostess took us to a table for 6, not 12. Had to wait another 20 min to be sat in a booth for 8. They added 3 chairs and we had to cram the 12th in. Food took awhile and wasn't as good as the last time I had it in Mesa. Maybe there's just a learning curve. For a great Toby Keith's experience, make the drive to Mesa."}
{"text":"Horrible service.. only reason I have them 2 stars was because the food was good..
I will never go back...2"}
{"text":"Cold, below average bar food served by disinterested waitresses. Eight of us chose this place over everything else here in Vegas and it was the worst bet we made all weekend! 
2 of our 8 couldnt get out of bed for 36 hours because of severe cramps and diahrhea. They each had the club sandwich. 
The rest of the meals were just ok, but on a 4 day vacation to lose a full day and night is not acceptable. 
This was food poisoning plain and simple. 
Clearly no one associated with TK ever does any knd of quality control here. This is a great example of how not to protect your brand. The TK brand will surely be a Walmart staple before long. 
The one star is for the Jack and Coke one of us had."}
{"text":"The food was not bad, the portions were not that big and the service was bad. Toby is not only loving this bar...he's loving the profits!!"}
{"text":"My husband loved this bar last time he was in Vegas so wanted to take me this time they weren't busy got right in order two drinks and water drinks came no water eh no big deal. Food came was ok nothing amazing still no water. Waitress came oo forgot water I'll be right back. Didn't see her again till she brought the check. They weren't busy, food was just so so and wait staff bla no thanks not returning"}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean, great stage for music, sound system is good.  Will be a great place for sports/UFC fights, etc.  TONS of staff here, and they all seemed to be standing around talking.  Not sure where they found all of the cute waitresses, there was probably 20 of them at a fairly slow part of the day.(330pm)I am not exaggerating that number, maybe more than 20..  Anyway, food seems kind of pricey, but this is a sports/music venue that we need on the west side.  Food came out fast and well prepared, tell the chefs to pay attention to the basics, eg.  Salt and Pepper go a long way to improving the flavor of most things.  Countless flat screen TV's make sure you have a good view of the game anywhere you sit.  The Fried Mac and Cheese triangles were good, they have a great ranch here, potato skins had very little flavor, salt and pepper solved that problem.  The bad: we ate at the bar and the male bartender was completely disconnected, had to ask for everything like refills and serving set(salt pepper, ketchup, etc and it was on a tray ready to go right under the bar in front of us). He was way more interested in talking to all the other cute waitresses and bartenders, can you blame him?  Yes I can, he needs to do his job still.  Like I said, the place is very well staffed and he was not busy at all.  This place has lots of potential, it just needs more management presence."}
{"text":"Worst service and managers. Make other plans trust me! Took 3 times to get a drink right and over 30 minutes"}
{"text":"We were tired after our flight from Houston, so we settled on this place so we wouldn't have to venture out.  We ordered the large appetizer platter ($18.) and the fried pickles ($6.99) to share.  The platter came with two barbeque chicken wings (whole), two stuffed potato skins, deep fried mac & cheese bites and two jalapeno poppers.  The only item on the whole plate worth eating was the mac & cheese bites.  Everything else was served almost cold and the wings and potato skins were pre-cooked and re-heated.  I don't know why the kitchen manager thinks it's okay to serve re-heated food that's cold. The pickles were hot and good.  I expected better."}
{"text":"Awful. My steak was over cooked and tough. Tried to tell our waitress Sue and she ignored us.  Worst dinner I've had in a long time. No worth $90 for certain"}
{"text":"Giant beers, live music every night & JD decorations. Can't hate on this place too much. The service we got was quick & the beer was cold. Not a fan of the country music but I'm always up for a live band & watching the couples twirl about."}
{"text":"Had an awesome lunch and drinks, friendly staff, great atmosphere and military friendly - 20 percent off with an I.D.  it was our best meal of our trip - we will definitely go back next time."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out. Drinks are expensive, but large and pretty strong. The price may turn you off, but they are actually worth it if you would ordinarily order 2-3. The service is very good. The only negative and the main reason for only 3 stars is the food is just okay. Nothing exciting or stand out."}
{"text":"This is my first time in the Vegas night life. It is intimidating being a girl In Vegas. There is a lot of competition with the night clubs. We decided to eat at Toby Keith's and it ended up being the highlight of our night. We ordered at the bar because we wanted to be closer to the music. The bartender JJ checked on us all night, even after we paid. She was fantastic! Great food, great people, and great music! I recommend it."}
{"text":"If you're craving fried food, large drinks and a loud atmosphere, you've come to the right place. We stopped here for a \"snack\" one afternoon, and several fried dishes later, were feeling full, guilty and completely satisfied!

All the appetizers were priced well, huge portions, and very tasty. We didn't have any drinks here, but the soft drinks were served in huge glasses. The server we had was very polite too!"}
{"text":"This place is SICK! As in totally AWESOME! If you are military, go gO GO! We are in the military and we got a free burger and a free beer! THEN they were giving out free shots at the bar! Amazing. Tasted good too. Fun country atmosphere. Woo!"}
{"text":"We have dinned here many times, we always have a groupon because the food is a little high in price for the type of food they serve, this could be due to it being in a casino. The servers are nice and friendly and we never have to wait to be seated. I tried the chicken wrap on one of our times there and was disappointed in what they charge to put a processed chicken finger in a wrap. I love their version of the ruben by only complaint is the meat is a little dry. My all time favorite is their fried twinkie, it melts in your mouth!! The fried pickles are also amazing the best way to start your meal. My husband was not crazy about their steak sandwich said it was a little tough, but the time before he had their fried fish and said it was amazing. I guess my review of this place is mixed they have some good menu items, but for the price i would eat elsewhere if i didn't have  a groupon. Service is great and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, most recently during the weekend of the National Finals Rodeo.  As expected, there were tons of folks in cowboy attire, lots of beer being gulped down, and drinks sipped out of mason jars.  They had a live band that was decent, go go dancers, and they'd occasionally blow a whistle and pour free shots into people's mouth.

What' was the problem then?
-- When the band was off stage they didn't play country music.  I want to hear Toby and George and Garth.  I didn't come here to hear hip hop.
-- As a theme bar/restaurant, I wasn't expecting to see little Asian guys at the bar.  I'm no racist (by saying that I probably am racist despite being an Asian/Pacific Islander), but I want to see a southern belle or a redneck guy pouring drinks at a country bar."}
{"text":"If Toby Keith is affiliated with this place in any way, he should be embarrassed with the piss poor service they provide. I should have listened to my fellow yelpers on this one. I sat at the bar for 10+ minutes before I flagged down help. It felt like I was broken down in the side of the road awaiting a tow truck. Anyway the bartender explained they were not covering that side of the bar as well? Ok, so I just moved to the other side. The same thing happened, no one approached me. My guest showed up and asked for a manager, some man with a porno mustache showed up and said he  laughed and said he would discipline them after 2am? Not sure, but it seemed inappropriate since the waitresses were very pretty. The waitress went on to say the restaurant was fairly new, however this was customer service 101 stuff.
I will never return an neither should you."}
{"text":"My wife and I while in Las Vegas stopped by Toby Keith's bar and grill. Been there before and was nothing to be excited about. Food nothing to write home about. The toby Keith store next door I have a problem with. Clothes sizing is way off. My wife wears small, she needed xlarge to fit. I am 2xl, I bought a 3xl and I swear it was a medium. We also purchased some other items, glassware cups etc. Toby sings about USA but all his item are made in China, India and more. Hypocrite!  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"So I love this bar but a little upset they aren't allowed to wear anymore Golden Knights shirts, loved that they appreciated our local sports team and want them to keep showing more spirit while they go to the Stanley cup finals. Like I said I love this bar and love the staff but show more love to our Golden Knights!"}
{"text":"Toby Keith's bar and grill was NOT 'as good as IT once was\"... 
the first time I went I had a blast and service was great. I loved it so much I dragged all my friends there on this trip to Vegas. This time from the minute we walked in we were very unimpressed. From waiting at the bar for over 10 ten minutes and not being served to being sat by a very unfriendly hostess and waiting another 10 minutes to meet our server. 
The food however was great and we loved the size of the drinks (once we finally got them) 
I'm not sure if I'd go back again. Maybe it's worth it if you like country music and they have live band but don't go there for the friendly service."}
{"text":"Just not what I expected. The service was weak at best, along with a less than friendly demeanor when we first walked in. The chicken was over cooked and we had to ask for a few of our missing items several times. The waitress did express some concern but added that the cooks were new(what does that mean?). I can at least say the beer was cold but thats about it.  Even though my sister lives 2 minutes from there I would rather jump in the car and head to Westgate up the block. Just sad!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Service was terrible, food selection and prices were terrible.   You can read the rest of the review, but point being soooo not worth the dust off your boots to enter. Waitresses had no idea what they were doing, when asking for something they acted as if they were doing you a favor. Told me one price for a beer charged me another. Then they had the audacity to  question my military service when I showed them my ID. Also I know this is \"Toby's\" bar but jeez there are literally hundreds of pictures if him everywhere."}
{"text":"This, was really good.  We both got hamburgers with fries.  The buns are delicious really soft. They have a Groupon too. We didn't have one but I would eat there again if we came back."}
{"text":"Ate here in 2015 it was ok. Went back a few weeks ago, bow has it gone down hill. Ordered the ribs. The meat was very bland, and COVERED in bbq sauce, the sauce didn't have a good taste either."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this bar.  It was slow.  Bellied up to the bar with 2 women and myself, waited 15 minutes for one of the 6 bar tenders to acknowledge our existence but it never happened. Maybe we weren't \"country\" enough.  Ended up walking out and buying a beer at the friendly convenience stop next door."}
{"text":"First my brother was wearing a shirt that says share a round with Isis and the hostess says your not aloud in hear and smirked. Then over priced and waiter never checked on us and needed mayonnaise and  salsa. Had to ask another waiter and they still forgot. Not that busy for a Friday. Also my brother is a lieutenant colonel. The only good thing was his free burger. But dry...."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun, but stick with the chicken tenders. The food is not good. Definitely stay away from the shrimp po-boy."}
{"text":"20 minute wait for a half empty restaurant.  Waitress was about as dumb as a post.  (Sorry post.)  Had 3 appetizers: Nachos w/beef, Quesadillas with chicken and the fried mac and cheese balls.  The balls were the size of a racquetball!  They were served with a fluorescent orange cheese like sauce.  They weren't terrible, but they could have been hotter.  The quesadillas were just gross.  The nachos were okay.  The best thing about this place is that they serve Pepsi and it comes in a huge mason jar.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service. Host went to seat us and we asked for a booth she said \"ok but don't come and complain to me that you can't eat\" (5 of us we're squeezing into a 4 person booth. Server Felicia was a horrible c**t. Literally the rudest server I've ever encountered. We were the 2nd party to sit when it opened and literally the whole restaurant got their food before us"}
{"text":"No, I'm not confused. I am indeed writing a review based on personal experience inside Toby Keith's Bar & Grill at Harrah's.

A friend of mine from NYC (whose father is an executive with Caesars Entertainment, the parent company of Harrah's) decided to use family connections for his birthday dinner...and we all got an invitation that the dinner was to be held at Toby Keith's. Wait, what? I was confused to say the least and had to call other people who I knew were also invited before we figured out what and where Toby Keith's was.

This place reminds of my college days at the University of Arizona in Tucson: cowboy hats, country music and lots of Jack Daniels bottles used as decoration. There was live music and the main singer looked like a skinnier Toby Keith. The restaurant was loud and our waitresses handled our large (and mostly obnoxious, though in good fun) party very well.

As for the food, I ordered the \"hottie wrap\" which is a sun dried tomato tortilla filled with strips of fried chicken (I know, not part of my usual diet but with all the Jack Daniels decorations around I felt fried anything was appropriate somehow) and lots of veggies. My guilty conscience made me ask for fat free ranch instead of bleu cheese. The wrap tasted fresh and everyone enjoyed their food. Orders ranged from burgers, to wings, to mac & cheese.

I'm not going to lie, our party of 20 people had an awesome time. Everything was on the house so needless to say the drinks were flowing. I didn't partake in any of the speciality cocktails because they all come in giant mason jars. I wanted something a little daintier. Oh, and to make things interesting some man (in hindsight I pray it was the bartender) came around with a bottle and gave everyone in our party (guys and girls) shots. The atmosphere was very fun and it was a great birthday dinner setting for a loud group."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Just decided to eat here because we were staying at Harrah's and it was convenient. I was pleasantly surprised. Food took a little long to come out but once it did it was great. A little on the pricey side but that's expected because of the location. I think I paid $17 for a grilled chicken sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"the service to just get a table....horrible.  Host?  hardly lives up to that name.  She said go find a table in bar.  None available.  We did a round.  And another.  She didn't help.  I get busy on game day but no seats for empty tables.  She said there were chairs but we didn't find any -- maybe she meant we need to make or bring our own chair.

We ended up leaving...disappointed we couldn't grab a bite but happy that we left before they also told us to make our own food."}
{"text":"Cool place, great country music and the BEST FRIES EVER!!!! You have to order the French fries. They're sooooo good."}
{"text":"Not a location I would have chosen--I was invited to join someone who was already coming here. Pulled pork sandwich was OK. Was served a mason jar full of diet Pepsi ... only problem: I ordered a diet Coke and wasn't told I'd be served Pepsi. An awful surprise.

Served a basket of bread and baby corn muffins (oh! the humanity!) with something that clearly wasn't butter. 

Cheaper than many places on the strip. Also, they allowed us to park for a few hours (we watched the Belgium vs. US game) without a hassle. Lots of TVs ..."}
{"text":"With some great reviews and some \"not to great\" ones, we thought we would give it a try since we were staying at Harrah's anyway.  Since some of our experience was great and some not so much, I have decided on 3-1/2 stars.  The visit didn't start off so well.  We were told that we would have about a 10 minute wait.  No big deal at all, we just went next door to the gift shop. We were literally there for 5-6 minutes and made the 5 second trek back to the restaurant.  The  hostess informed us that she had called our name and had to give our table away and that we would have to go back on the \"list\".  Again, no problem, since it was later in the evening and it didn't seem busy in the slightest.  

At this point I would like to insert my opinion on the Hostess.  I truly believe that this person had something against smiling.  You would think that the business owner would want the first person that customers would come in to contact with would be a friendly, helpful person who appears to enjoy what they do.  To represent the brand in a positive way.  I expected a lot better, Toby!  

When we were led to our table, it was a little surprising that the place was less than half full.  As I mentioned, it was later in the evening but the Hostess made it seem as though it was packed!  Anyway, the food was a highlight, and since this is a restaurant, I guess that is what was most important!  We had the Brisket Nachos.  They were amazing!  My boys both had Bronco Burgers and they were HUGE!  They both loved them.  I had the Texas Cheesesteak.  It was good but not great in my opinion.  It was pretty soggy, but tasted pretty good.  

I would go back, if only for those Nachos!  I am sure that the atmosphere is much better around dinner time.  It was pretty laid back at the time we went.  Hopefully the Hostess was just having a bad day."}
{"text":"Free food and beer for military! Yup 5 starts. Great bartender and TVs everywhere. Foods also pretty damn good. Try the deviled eggs! The burgers are damn good!"}
{"text":"I had eaten here once a while back and enjoyed it a lot. Yelpers Bobby K. and Anna from VA came into town and suggested this place for dinner. It's located inside Harrah's and coming in from the parking garage it's going to be hard to miss since it's right there on the left and country music can be heard coming from inside the restaurant. Bobby had seats for us already so there was no wait time. Our server was friendly and took great care of us. They have TVs all over playing music videos and while most of it was obviously country music, they did play some Metallica and Pearl Jam LOL. Our table was lost in awesome conversation until we noticed my wife stuck on one of the TVs. They played 3 Luke Bryan videos back to back so we lost her for a bit. They have a bar you can sit at if you don't want to sit at a table or booth.

I had a Fried Mac and Cheese ball that was average. I was craving a burger so I looked over the menu to see what sounded good. I went with the Hottie Burger. The burger came with a hot link on it as well fried onions, lettuce, tomato and pepper jack cheese. The burger was cooked to my liking and tasted really good. The only complaint is that it was spicy at all. Not even a hint of heat. For a burger with a name \"Hottie\" in it you'd expect it to have a kick. While the burger was very good.... I would suggest they add some fried jalapenos in place of the fried onions. My wife had the Hottie Wrap and felt the same way. She said it tasted great and the amount of guacamole and other stuff inside her wrap was great but the chicken had no heat at all. The Fried Bologna sandwich yelper Anna got was effing interesting. I left stuffed. That's all."}
{"text":"This is a bit off the beaten path. You have to make your way through Harrah's all the way to the back, up the escalator and then there it is.

So for some reason I have been here a few times, and each time I really thought the food was less than desirable. This time was a little different. 

The food is quite pricey for what it is. Yeah, you get a dollar off if you use your Total Rewards card, but really - it's still kind of expensive for just ok food. I got the chicken wrap last time and it was utterly inedible. I definitely won't get that ever again. Lots of wrap, not a lot of chicken.

This time, we ordered the fried macaroni and cheese and the brisket nachos. Let me say, I was pleasantly surprised. The mac and cheese balls were lightly battered and fried just crispy enough. The nachos - were heaping and the brisket was very good. good choices this time.

Next - the beer - so there isn't a great selection of draft beer - but the bonus is how large a draft beer is. I believe they are 22oz for $10. Which isn't bad. And of course you can take it to go in a plastic cup. (But don't try and bring your outside drink into TK's)

If you're with a lot of friends, a beer tower is definitely the way to go... 

Minuses - the whole bar area didn't have a server. So all the tables in the bar area hadn't been bussed and it was a total mess. It's not really a problem to order the food through the bar,  but just means getting up and down if you need other things. The bartender was friendly and helpful, but then you wonder what you're tipping for when you are getting up and down... but oh well."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Our waiter was awesome and the burgers were tastey. The music was also definitely good too. All in all a great place to eat. And they have a special for military that you just can't beat."}
{"text":"I love country music and good food, so as suggested a friend of mine tagged along with me and we went to check this place out. It is located on the second floor of the Harrah's Casino. First impression of this place was wow, nice low key, laid back place. The food smelled really good and my stomach was ready ;) We were seated near the bar area and once in a while during dinner you'd hear whistles going off and a showdown going on at the bar...a lively place for sure. Country music filled the place and TV monitors showed the latest music videos on CMT. The second thing i noticed about this place was some of the male waiters were hot. :P A big plus for me.

I started off with a drink, and I was surprised that my drink was going to cost $15!!!!! I understood when i received my Toad sucker Pond in a huge MASON JAR! These people take their booze very seriously...it was great! When my Burger and onion rings came out to the table i was amazed to find the onion rings stacked ON TOP of my burger rather than the traditional on-the side placing. The food was exceptionally good, but the price was a bit high. 

Still, I will definitely be coming here again...even if the prices are a bit high!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a VERY LAST RESORT! I will not ever recommend this place to anyone. The food was mediocre at best. I had a sampler and the BBQ that was on the plate was so gross and overly greasy. The service was very poor and took forever. My friend ordered a chicken fried steak and he said it was so disgusting. He didn't have any gravy on his mashed potatoes and the steak was poorly prepared. I just won't ever go back to this place. If your hungry then go somewhere else!! This place is terrible!"}
{"text":"We just came here with a large group and got kicked out bc we apparently refused to pay our tabs and were over intoxicated.  Umm, I personally paid $123 of overcharged drinks for my friends. We paid whatever charges they said we were refusing and left. We will never go there again. Take your money somewhere else that will at least treat you nicely. The drinks were overpriced and the service was horrible.  Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"An interesting place to start a day off at.

We got up late (I know, in vegas?  really?) and were super hungry, so we ambled down the strip, and an idea for a fried bolonga sandwich came to mind, so we went over and sat down.

The service was decent.  The fried bologna with freedom fries was good, the fried mac and cheese was artery hardening.

Overall a decent meal, waaay better then most of the Coffee shops in the hotels i have eaten at, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Drinks are good and I love the decor and country music, but the food is just OK. Double check the menu because couple of items are named the same thing, already messed up my order!"}
{"text":"Amazing Bar Food!!! 
Mac and Cheese Balls and Fried Bologna Sandwich! PERIOD!! Don't come here with HIGH class taste buds! Excellent Bar Food but after reading some people's reviews I don't think they know what the specialty items on the menu are. 

The environment is always fun. Great servers and bartenders! We ate at the bar one time and at a table another time and came last year for a friends B-day party with a group of about 20 people and everyone had a great time!"}
{"text":"We ordered too much or rather Toby's serves large portions! 

We split between us the Fried Pickles, the Rueben (which included fries) with a side of season veggies. Our drink was Kentucky Sweet Honey - Loved It!

Everything was delicious but we couldn't finish the fries and we were full the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"God. Just close this place down already. Either that or just fire everyone and get a whole new team. People who actually know what they're doing and isn't harassing people to 'step outside' for no valid reason. Horrible food and just overall atmosphere. And Phil R. from guest relations, save your lame comment. You don't care! I've had just about enough of this place."}
{"text":"I happened to see the happy hour sign as I was leaving the monorail and heading to another location. Originally, I wasn't going to stop but I saw the special pricing and decided to stop in. Several hours later, I had a nice buzz and my bank account hadn't taken a massive hit like other Vegas establishments did. I'm not normally a big Blue Moon drinker but $4.50 for 2 mason jar (32oz) drinks was a deal I don't think I could find anywhere else. 
I think a lot of others thought the same thing and as a result there was one bartender running around trying to service the whole place. The service took longer than average and I had to ask where my appetizer was since it had taken so long. 

Overall, I did enjoy my experience but I think they could benefit by having a bit more coverage in the bar area."}
{"text":"Toby Keith I do NOT love your bar. The food was ok. But the staff was RUDE!!! my goodness! Unfriendly! It was our first time there. My husband & I were meeting our family there. We were the first to arrive. After standing in the front for over 5 min. I walk to a podium off to the side & ask if we seat ourselves or is there a host? I was rudely informed by a crabby phillipino lady that she WAS the host. And we could not be seated until our entire party arrived. So we waited. When we all got there & got seated...we waited some more. The whole experience was way overpriced. Thumbs down Toby Keith.....get a new staff."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Understaffed and burgers are way better at Guy Fieri's in the Linq next door and about the same price."}
{"text":"The service is great, the food is great, and the portions are great.  However- we were staying over a mile away and walked there ONLY because we had a $50 gift card to use.  When we went to pay, we were told our gift cards are not valid in Nevada or Oklahoma (where most of the restaurants are located).   So- we had to come up with  the cash (again- we only went there because we had the card- there were many places closer to where we are staying), and now we're still stuck with a gift card we can't use.  Tried calling the corporate office- number is no longer valid.  Currently waiting for the Las Vegas location to call me back with a good number to call.  Bottom line- DO NOT GO HERE TO USE A GIFT CARD BECAUSE THEY WON'T TAKE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Only one star from me. I really don't love this bar.  

I was really disappointed with every aspect of this place.  Service was non existent.  She took a very long time for her to initially come to our table.  Our waitress was hardly seen the entire evening.  

My husband and I were splitting the nachos.  It's very rare for a place to mess up nachos.  I mean.... how can you mess up nachos? Well they succeeded in this.  Neither of us liked it.  There wasn't a good flavor at all.  You can choose chicken or beef.  We chose beef.  Little did we know it was a shredded beef and not a ground beef.  The beef was dry and cold.  Our friend was highly disappointed in his meal as well.  Again, no flavor in country fried steak.  Bummer.

Please trust me and skip this place."}
{"text":"seriously the best fries I have had in a long time...I am a HUGE Toby fan so I love this place"}
{"text":"Food was decent,  I had the loaded nachos which were ok and my wife had the caprese burger which was great.   

The waitresses are dressed a little inappropriately for children,  but not the worst I've seen."}
{"text":"Burgers were super thick and tasty, but they use shredded lettuce and that's not so great on a burger. The fries are amazing! Seasoned and delicious. My bro and I finished off burgers with the Fried Twinkie which was actually pretty good. It's not a grease bomb like you'd think.

They have country music videos playing all the time and when Toby Kieth's \"I Love This Bar\" comes on everyone gets free shots poured directly in the mouth from a chick walking on the bar. Bras hanging above the bar keep the place extra classy.

The food's good, but I don't think the burger and fries are worth the $13-14 I paid. That's my only complaint. I do believe I'll return with friends so we can eat, drink and dance. Seemed like there was enough space by the video screen for some country dancin' and west coast swing."}
{"text":"What a fun place!  Live country music....good food....good drinks....just a good ol' country time!  I drowned myself in fried foods, but it was all sinfully delicious!  Fried pickles, country fried steak, and what better to end that all off with....fried twinkies!!!!!  (All washed down with drinks in mason jars!)  A very different experience for a break from typical \"Vegas\".  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hmmm. What can I say? Well the Happy Hour prices are very good. The food...not so great; generic chain food. Our server was really friendly. I hope she and all the others are comfortable in their short shorts and cowboy boots! I would think that would get old. Not only are you being constantly ogled by the customers but you have to walk around in that crap! Workplace hazard if you ask me. My biggest concern with this place is their use of plastic cups. Really? Who wants a beer in plastic? What a waste, they get ZERO stars for sustainable business practices. Shame on you Toby Kieth, aren't cowboys supposed to love the outdoors?"}
{"text":"See my check in ... We haven't even sat down yet and already awful service.  I come here every time I visit Vegas..:: I come to the bar, that's great the restaurant... Not so much I'm pretty sure if I'm back it won't be my choice."}
{"text":"Very Good bar food with good portions for a pretty decent price for Vegas. Kind of difficult to find...you have to walk though Harrahs and then upstairs...but then again you have to always walk through something to get something in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Bartenders are cool. Good music live and on the sound system.  Drinks are good, times are great!!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch! Friendly staff, good service and tasty food. When you sign up for their VIP Club (for free) you get an email for a free steak dinner on your birthday and a free fried twinkie for dessert. Today was my husband's birthday and he got the free ribeye steak dinner and loved it. Fried twinkie...yummy!"}
{"text":"A typical bar food fare, though a great break from the typical Las Vegas restaurant experience. Reasonably priced, great service, great pulled pork sandwich!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the portions are large.  One of the most reasonably priced places to eat on the Vegas Strip.  The girls are wearing leather chaps, so I probably wouldn't take my kids there again, my boys (7and6) made a point of looking down when the waitress came by... it is Vegas though so it's kind of expected.  The service is VERY slow and the wait staff could be better.  Not sure if I would go back.

{"text":"Just found out that Toby Keith's doesn't do a free burger for vets, but I do get 20% off. So I'm having pancakes and hot links for lunch.

Ok.. so took 30 minutes to get my food, so hooray comps. So I snagged desert and left a good tip since I have no cash on me. Also... The hot links tasted like mildly spicy polish sausages.
Annnnnd apparently I must be black because of my opinion on the hotlinks, I heard this as being passed on from one of my waitresses coworkers. I brought this concern to the manager a Jerry O'Brien and he offered me his card and that my next meal there is on him. That is, if I ever return.

The one brought spot here was my waitress Dana, she did everything possible to give me a good experience?. Every restaurant could use 5 people like Dana at minimum.

Two stars only because of my waitress Dana."}
{"text":"OMG please do not believe the reviews..We did and $7.00 for a deep fried twinkie.  Plus we asked for ribs..reply sorry no more available, salad sold out...who are you kidding..The service was terrible and the cost was over $100.00 , one hamburger and shared a Turkey Club, one soda and two ice tea drink. I do not know who is writing these reviews..are you working for Toby Keith's bar and grill...Please waste your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"What can I say about Toby Keith's Bar & Grill?? Well, it's just that..a bar! Food was just mediocore & the service sucked!! Will definitely NOT be back"}
{"text":"The group i was with was all in for this place - Me - I would not go back.  The food and service were sub-par.  Too many other great places in Vegas to be wasting my time at a less than average place.

If you are looking for average - this is your place."}
{"text":"I have never eaten here. 

Every time I have come here, its like 10 PM or later, I'm already drunk, and I have an amazing time. 

They have a band that plays and a DJ to play when the band is taking a break. 

The big drinks are served in Mason Jars. Which I'm kind of a sucker for. 

Strong drinks, fun bartenders, country music, and so much fun. 

I seriously love this place. I wish they had a bathroom inside, but its not really uncommon to not have a bathroom inside in Vegas. 

I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great place to get hammered, this bar is the one for you! Their 32oz (yes, 32oz!) mason jar drinks are an incredible deal and STIFF but still taste amazing! I am not a light weight by any means when it comes to drinking but after 1 1/2 of those drinks and a bar sweat shot I was done for. Not that I'm complaining one bit because it resulted in a fun evening with the hubby ;) and the bartenders made sure my hubby could get me home which was nice. 

I have no comment on the food as we only drank there. The bartenders were fun and charismatic and made killer drinks. 

Only downside is the fact that the location is horrible. We almost gave up looking for it because it was so far deep within the hotel. Otherwise if you are looking for a fun, relaxing bar to get your drink on I recommend taking the trek through the hotel to find it."}
{"text":"Hostess was not friendly, we couldn't sit in the restaurant side because we were only ordering appetizers, there is no service on the bar side, you get your own drinks and have to ask for a menu, seems run down from the last time we were here...Not impressed"}
{"text":"The food might be good, but I'll never know. We were seated by the hostess who brought us our place settings and menus and told us our waitress would be right with us. I was kind of excited because they looked nice in there assless pants. Well we waited and we waited and oh we waited. Nothing.... no water, no cocktails, no appetizers. I looked around and the girls were nowhere to be seen. My wife and everyone else in my party looked at each other and said, \"this is ridiculous, let's go\" we got up and walked out. On the way out we told the hostess that no one ever came to help us. It wasn't her fault. So on the way out (outside of the restaurant) guess who we see. The waitresses literally taking ass pictures with other people. Well, I know where their priorities were. I have always wanted to try this place since I am a huge country fan. But, next time I walk by this place. I'm going to keep walking."}
{"text":"Went on 11/16/14 for a quick lunch with some friends. Great food. We all ordered different things and were all very impressed with the food. Delicious and generous portions.  Such a shame that they have such horrible service.  The hostess was rude and the waitress extremely slow and we had to keep asking the busboy to call our waitress for us.  Terrible and slow service but excellent food. Service is why I gave them a 3,  food only wood be a 5 star."}
{"text":"The prices in the gift shop seem rather high for a lot of items here! But did find a Toby Keith tshirt and a couple of other things.
Then we went to the bar and had 2 drinks, which was another Twenty dollar bill! Sad how expensive Vegas is getting!"}
{"text":"If money and time are no object than come to the arena. You can get a 12 oz beer for $7 and a 20 oz beer for $14. We came for a concert that was supposed to start at 8pm and it's 10:21 pm and it still hasn't started. There has  been no announcements as to why. No DJ and nothing but waiting. A pretzel will cost you $8 and that's the low end of the price point. So if you have time and money to waste than it's a great spot!"}
{"text":"My husband told me the chicken fried steak was awesome. After a long day of traveling I was excited to eat southern comfort food but I was a bit disappointed with the quality of my meal. The batter on the chicken fried steak was good and had a nice flavor. The inside was another story! The steak was tough and dry. I'm here for a few more days, but I doubt if I revisit. The hostess and waitress were nice, but the food was below average. Sorry hubby, I have to disagree with you on this one."}
{"text":"We used to love this bar and grill, but not anymore! Ribs were fatty, chicken fried steak was all breading, chili was horrible with a big ball of frozen sour cream in it!! Service was horrible!!  Prices too high for the quality of food.  We have never been so disappointed.  Coffee tasted like it was weeks old.  Needless to say, will not be back!"}
{"text":"When I came to this bar I had a great time!!!
The music is all kinds of different. We heard varieties of Spanish, Country, Top 40 and Rock music here. I came after 10pm so I cannot comment on the food.
This bar is a great bar for all walks of life.
Everyone had a great time in my group, and every person that has been there and told me about it has said that they have had a great time there as well!
Try it out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited on a recent mini vacation. We cannot vouch for the food as we did not eat a meal--we went for the music. But our experience was so great we went two nights in a row. The live music is really high quality--and no cover charge. Cheapest entertainment in Las Vegas (well, if you like country, which we do). The drinks were delicious, and potent, too :)."}
{"text":"I \"did not love this bar\" Toby's place in OK City is great, this place is its polar opposite!  Was seated quickly then left &forgotten. Sat for 25min without so much as a hello or can I get you a drink? Toby Keith would of been very disappointed with this lack of hospitality. We got up, told the manager why we were leaving, then left."}
{"text":"Extra crispy and gooey deep fried mac and cheese from Toby Keiths bar and grill. Best mac and cheese balls! Comes with a side of cheese sauce. I preferred when it came with the southwest ranch instead which to my surprise is ranch and Salas mixed together.  Delicious !!!! Always great service !"}
{"text":"About the worst customer service I have ever had.  I don't know Toby Keith personally but I can't imagine he would want his name associated with the kind of service I received."}
{"text":"We went here for my friend's 30th birthday (her choice) and had an amazing time. I don't even like country music and this was still the highlight night of our trip. There was a live band and they also played Top 40 hits in between sets. Our bartender, James, was freakin fabulous. He made us \"sweet but strong\" shots all night long. The only downside was the 24 hour recovery period, but that was likely my fault :) Can't speak to their food, but their bartenders, music and patrons made for a great night."}
{"text":"We got here early so we only had to wait a few minutes on a Thursday night...upon leaving the place had a LONG wait - people waiting on the inside and outside so tip: arrive early for dinner.

The service was slow....I think our waitress gave more attention to the tables of 4 or more (for the tip) over our table for two.  The fried mac & cheese balls made a fabulous appetizer.  The manager brought it out so I think it may have been sitting in the kitchen a little long and our food came out before we were done with it. 
We had the fried bologna sandwiches for dinner... I felt a little weird ordering that in a restaurant, but really - you can't get that just anywhere.  It was HUGE and filling and the drinks come in a large mason jar so you WILL fill up here though a price comes with it... this place is on the pricey side but due so such slow service, I was able to save some money on the tip so lessened it to the 15% range over 20."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Thursday night and the place was hopping.  Drinks, while expensive, were good in taste and strong in booze.  Live music while we were there was extremely good, and it wasn't \"just\" country-country.  Some of the more recent country hits that blur the pop line were played and people danced on the dance floor anytime the songs welcomed it.

ps:  If you're coming in through the Monorail entrance, getting to this bar is a snap.  If you're coming in from the strip you want the escalators that take you towards the monorail as well as Starbucks."}
{"text":"Uh...kinda hate saying this but this wasn't that great.  The bartender tried hard but it took at least 45 minutes to get my half rack of ribs and they weren't that great (not terrible, but I've had better), toss in slightly high prices and a limited draft beer selection and there are better things out there and better things for the money."}
{"text":"I  (HEART) This Bar!  The dumplings were amazing, played slots with lunch, and bartender Jared was great!  Wins all around!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place but yikes it has gotten pricey and the food is not that amazing.  We spent $65 for two burgers, onion rings and a beer!  Even by vegas standards that is pricey for a couple of burgers!  The wait is long and the atmosphere is crazy noisy at best.  This used to be a favorite vegas stop, but I think I have been there for my last visit."}
{"text":"This place sucks! The decor looks nothing like you would expect from a \"country\" bar. And the prices for drinks are OUTRAGEOUS. I'm use to paying 3 dollars or so for a domestic beer (Miller Lite) I'd even pay $4. But $6 is ridiculous. Even for the Strip. The mixed drinks are a minimum of $12 and they come in small glasses. My girlfreind wanted a sprite and that cost $3.50 and was in a small glass that you couldn't even put an entire can of sprite into...and it had ice in it! So this place is an obvious rip off. I HATE THIS BAR!"}
{"text":"There are really only two reasons to come to this spot. 1) People watching. 2) To laugh at the shrine Toby Keith created to himself.

The music (when there is a live band) is actually pretty good. But the people watching is what brings me back again and again. The clientele here is so mixed. All the cowboys in town find their way here, but so do the bachelorette parties, woo girls, frat boys, football fans, old couples, etc. 

It gets quite packed at peak times. Bar and table service can be exceptionally slow. The food ain't much to write home about. The drinks are overpriced and kinda sucky. But you don't come here for the eating and drinking. You come here to walk around, shake your head, and repeatedly say to yourself \"just who the hell does Toby Keith think he is?!\" - and to just watch all the crazy people having a crazy time."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try a fried Twinkie and eat southern food all while listening to great music- guess ill have to make a trip back to Dallas bc this place was awful! No one in our 5 person party liked any item- not appetizers, entrees nor desserts! Cold, soggy, bland, dry, and overall unappealing. Visit the gift shop but skip the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is rated oddly low. Or maybe I just had a uniquely pleasant experience here. 

So I came here on a Thursday night which is ladies night (50 cent drinks) before 11. And there was a DJ, people were dancing lively and the dance floor had enough room to two step but wasn't a ghost town - just the right balance. The dance floor is very large by the way, great plus. 

The music was a nice mix of hip hop and country in case you can't two step (although you're in a country bar). I like the mix, I think I would get tired of hearing country all day (like at Whiskey Row in Old Town). 

Unfortunately I didn't come here for the food, so I have no idea what it's like, just came to dance with some friends. Maybe I'll come back to try it. 

The bartenders are attentive which is another plus. The crowd is interesting, definitely a mix of young and old. Since it was ladies night Thursday night, there were a lot of ladies for the night. Sort of unusual for a late scene at a bar, but I guess that's why ladies night is implemented to bring us on in, and it works. :P  

The bathrooms were great, many many stalls - no lines, no wait! And they were very clean. :)

The patio was sort of packed, but there's a lot of free seating inside and out so that's a plus unlike at nightclubs where it's 100% VIP only. 

So overall, it was a good experience. Not much to complain about - the crowd was slightly obnoxious giving the security and staff a hard time, but the security and staff were very patient and fantastic, they dealt with everything professionally and fast."}
{"text":"I have been to this bar a few times and each time we were there, the service was mediocre at best. The staff is horrible and rude. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Well, this place is hopeless. I have been trying for 3 days to get through their phone line, and make a reservation. I have left a voicemail, and never received a call back. This place is not worth my time. I will not go to an establishment that neglects potential customers. I haven't even stepped foot in to this place and already they get one star for poor customer service. I can't imagine how it would be actually going here. For that, I will never give you my business.  Screw you Toby Keith's!"}
{"text":"\"No cover charge...\" Seems nobody at Toby Keith's has ever heard his song. Oh well I understand they need to make a profit, but be warned there is a $5 cover for guys. Show your military i.d. for free cover.

So lets review. The food and service gets 2 stars, but then again I don't come here to eat. I come here to dance. The dance floor is great and is never too crowded. I must say the crowd here is a complete 180 from the one in Mesa. I kept seeing guys with baggy pants and stickers on their hats and women with tight short dresses with hooker heels. It's a country bar...not a hip hop club. I guess that's why the dance floor is not crowded, because not to many people their can country dance. The drink prices are pretty insane, I think it was $9 for a tall blue moon eek!

I would take this one over the Mesa one any day. The layout is better, the dance floor is nice and I could actually find a seat. So at the end of the day I'm a fan and it's a good place to come dance."}
{"text":"We took our crew of 12 Vegas goers to Toby Keith's. They got us seated quickly & the food was solid. From burgers to wings to nachos, we were all pleased w/ the food! The drinks are yum"}
{"text":"So ok I got a groupon for this place and that's really the only reason we went in. Heck we aren't even country fans but I love groupon!! Ok so We were there on a Thursday (1/30/14) for lunch and we were seated right away. After looking over the menu I ordered the grilled chicken wrap and fries and the hubby ordered a club sandwich(sans fries, fries are extra) I was very excited to try my food because it looked good( sigh I should have ordered the burger the safest choice) . My wrap was huge BUT where was the chicken....I searched and searched and only pulled lots of lettuce and corn and then ohhh yes there is my one piece of chicken (huh?) blah not happy. My hubby must have seen the starved look in my eyes so he shared his club sandwich. It was actually good but then again can a person really mess up processed meats on bread? 
Well...I don't think id go back it just doesn't seem worth it. Our waitress was a peach but great service for not so good food ( ehh). I think next time I'll stick to American diner at the nyny hotel."}
{"text":"Really not my cup of tea.  I was given the \"opportunity\" to eat here with friends.  For me it's like Chili's meets the trailer park. Pretty run of the mill burgers and fries, The menu say \"from the smoker\" but ribs taste like Curley's from Costco.  Everything is dressed up with kitchy kountry names.  They still call french fries \"Freedom Fries\" - which may indicate the last time the menu was updated.  

Lots of country music videos running, thankfully not all Mr Keith's.  The hostess was friendly and she really tried, we had a big group and she held it together and the orders came out together.  The women here wear chaps with hot pants which I guess is Vegas \"flair\".  The service was good although they gave me chicken I didn't order on my salad - boiled and refrigerated from yesterday or so - it was getting a little extra flavor.  

It's cowboy meets run of the mill Vegas - if that's your thing, enjoy the Freedom Fries.  I wouldn't choose it."}
{"text":"I visited this bar about 9 months ago and was pretty disappointed with the staff, prices, cleanliness, and quality of the entertainment.  I revisited last week, and found that aside form the stupid high drink prices, the band was quite good, the staff was friendly and attentive, and it's cleaner.  James was a good bar tender.  If they only had reasonable drink prices, I would have spent more time there.  $7-8 for a domestic beer is just too much!"}
{"text":"The foods always good and almost always have live music.  The flat iron steak was done right.  Sodas served in an ice cold mason jar"}
{"text":"Do not waste your hard earned money here, there are several other country bars around, go to them!

My husband and I's 2nd trip here this past Friday has me determined never to return as well as to spread the word of how horrible the service, food and management was! We waited over 15 minutes to be served, my order was not only wrong but RAW! The management staff was so ignorant to comment that I'll be fine as people consume raw fish all the time. The gal serving asked if we needed a to go box as my husband pointed at both I nodded and she removed my plate and threw it away! This was a FULL plate of food, I had probably 3 bites no joke. She then insisted ONLY my husband asked for a to-go box although he pointed and I nodded. Not only that, but our tab, HA! Nothing done, no offer for dessert either. This was the 2nd trip - both a waste of time and money. So disappointed in the brand altogether. Stay away! I know others who have gotten sick too!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for some great atmosphere and drinks the size of your head. They cost a little extra, but just get the double, its worth the jar. Live band and dancers. Great time."}
{"text":"Read a lot of bad reviews on food and service but to be honest we had great food and service. I showed the manager the bad ratings from yelp. She actually read some of the reviews and was really cool about owning their mistakes. She said they have changed their training and they are working on their customer service. I appreciated her taking time to talk to us. We had great service and great food. Give this place a try it seems to have changed for the better :)"}
{"text":"Wow - a lot of negativity in the reviews here.  I guess my expectations just weren't so high.  I expected average food and got that.  What I didn't expect was how much fun the dancing would be and that the music would be pretty good.  I've been here a couple of times and I think the bar area is pretty fun for a couple hours if you're in the mood for a casual and country bar.  Go to dinner someplace else."}
{"text":"It is what it is. It's basically a TGIFridays. But the vibe is good. Live band on the weekends and strong drinks. The wings are great and the food is solid. It's a good time in Vegas if you are too old for the club scene (sadly I am) . Go there have a good time eat drink and be merry"}
{"text":"As the song says \"I love this bar\". You'll see old folks dancing and having a great time, you'll see young and old chicks flashing their titties for drinks. Great bands at 9pm every night and good bartenders. They do that flair crap but we can wait the extra minute for our drinks. Oh yes, the drinks... They have a good list of specialty drink like \"Whiskey Girl\" and \"Pondskipper\" or whatever that are GREAT and they serve them in Mason Jars. They are a bit pricey at $18 but you will only need one. You can get any drink or beer in the Mason Jars. 

They do play nothing but country music. How bad is that really? It's not like it's Hip Hop, still a lot of people won't come here. To them we say; just realize that you aren't as cool as you think you are so just fucking go and have a good time. This is another tourist trap and a hell of a good one too. The people-watching is top notch and people will actually talk your ear off. As you know, we like tourist traps, maybe because we like being a tourist... Fuck we wish we were somewhere being tourists right now. Oh boo hoo, suppose we'll have to be satisfied with places like Toby Keith's."}
{"text":"\"I Love This Bar\". Great song, great place.
Now I'm going to rate this place strictly as a bar, not as a grill, as I did not have any of the food. I came here on a Thursday night, and got in at about 10:30. No ID check, No cover charge, just walk on in and head up to the bar. Very cool.
There was a live band playing, but they were very, very good. Played mostly country, but threw in some old classics to get people on the dance floor. It's a very modern country type atmosphere, and a LOT of fun. Noticed the bras hanging all around the bar, always kind of funny to notice the different sizes and styles. 
All the drinks are served up in mason jars, pretty cool. Lots of beers on tap, although I decided with a Long Island Ice Tea. Very strong, and very good. Since it was my birthday, the bartender hooked me up with a free shot. Not quite sure what it is, but free booze is free booze. After about 30 minutes, the band decided to take a break, and a live DJ started up playing country hits, announcing FREE SHOTS at the bar. And boy, they weren't kidding. EVERYBODY made their way over to the bar, and the bartenders hooked everyone up with a free shot. Of course, the beautiful ladies had it poured into their mouth from the large dispenser, as it should be.
The bartenders were very cool, made some very cool drinks, and were very interactive with all the people hanging at the bar. The band was pretty damn good, and had a LOT of people on the dance floor. One young lady, TRASHED beyond belief, had everyone's attention, especially after throwing her panties to the drummer. A lot of folks boot scootin' and doing the electric slide. 
Good music, good times, and not a bad price. Definitely recommend this place as a chill alternative to the night clubs that dominate the Vegas scene. Stop in, relax, enjoy some good country, and drink your face off."}
{"text":"This place definitely just hired a bunch of girls who don't know what they're doing. As being a server myself for a long time I understand they struggles. However, when I went, it wasn't all that busy. The food was great, that's the only positive thing I have to say for my experience. It didn't help that I had to personally go up to the bar to get refills for my family. Horrible management and untalented servers."}
{"text":"Why do they play hip hop here? I typically love this place. I love the live music and some good two-stepping, but that can be difficult with all of the drunks stumbling all over the dance floor waiting for a Kanye song. 

I love Vegas, I love a good drunk crowd, but I also love my country. If I wanted booty shaking I would go elsewhere, but if I go to Toby Keith's, I want some country."}
{"text":"Live music, pictures, sports, super good food, and nice drinks! Coming from MI to see this restaurant - inside Harrah's - was amazingly cool! The ribs were sweet and smoked fresh! The baked beans had the right heat and the mashed potatoes were wholesome. The Whiskey Girl drink was big but still delicious! Keep it up guys! Tourists all over the place. Also the band played Alan Jackson and Johnny Cash so that was great."}
{"text":"I didn't hold out much hope for anything inside a Harrah's casino.  But a bunch of my friends that I haven't seen in a couple of years were going there to catch up and talk about an awesome day of flying.

For a Wednesday night, it was cool that there was a band.  And the band wasn't that bad.  But thats where the positives ended.  It took forever to get served a drink.  And I got a weird look when I asked for a diet Coke. (Sorry Toby minion. Despite your valiant attempt to get me to buy a jar of booze, I didn't feel like getting wasted when I had to fly 13 hours later).  The floor was sticky almost everywhere near the bar.  And even though it was only 10pm, some drunk moron dropped his drink on the ground and walked away.  No big deal right? Now you'd think a waitress would get a mop and clean it up.  But nope, they just put a cone over the spill.  It was as if no one noticed as the spill grew exponentially from underneath the cone."}
{"text":"Wehaa!!
Hubby OF\"COURSE loved this bar....the gal..hey hey hey \"BARTENDER\" was cute as a button and very polite...yet funnyyy as all get out and looked like the original Dukes of Hazrds gal!! She also said she had been there since that very bar opened.....I believe she said she 34 and of'course u would not have known it..she had 2 ponytails..and could dance all over that bar in cowboy boots ..and cutoff shorts..lol and pour your drinks backwards off that bar into your mouth or glass...!!  
We needed that lil afternoon break...fun fun!!  then of to gambling!!"}
{"text":"Seriously 1 of the worst experiences ever. Food was simply frozen and reheated in the microwave. My husbands bbq ribs were cold when sent back they were still cold. My chicken sandwich had black burnt bacon which ruined the whole thing. The service was sub-par although the waitress was nice she only checked on us once. The upside was kids always eat free however my daughter wasn't interested in the chicken tenders that had no flavor. I had to feed her something else when we got home. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"As a Christmas present to my Mom, I took her to Vegas to see Garth Brooks at the Wynn. She is a huge country fan, so I really wanted her to enjoy herself on our two day trip. So we HAD to see her favorite (Toby Keith's) bar at Harrah's. My expectations for Harrah's wasn't high at all, and it met those expectations.

\"I Love This Bar\" was basically the Hard Rock Cafe for Country meets Coyote Ugly. The place was loaded with Toby's records and hats and shirts he wore at certain events. The staff was sexy delicious. The outfits were as follows: cowboy hat, little black shirt that reads \"HOTTIE\", black booty panties, and black assless leather chaps. Possibly the greatest work uniform of all time? I think so.

The food was just ok. I got a western burger and it was gigantic. The fries were \"crusty\" and meh. Toby's \"I Love This Bar\" song and video came on and they announced free shots - so I ran over to the bar where the bartenders dump it straight from bottle inti to your mouth. Not a spritz either, like fill your mouth from throat to lips. Savage style. I kinda like it. Just because Mom had to try it - we got the Deep Fried Twinkie for dessert. When in Rome...

All in all, a cool place to drink and fantasize about your server. Food was pretty decent. I've got a new respect for TK. Definitely a cooler spot than Sammy Hagar's or Vince Neil's. And I'm not even a Country fan.

4.25 stars. But why no mechanical bull? You'd think it's a no brainer."}
{"text":"We've been here several times. We love the music and the atmosphere but the food is only so-so. This trip, we had the steak, the pulled pork sandwich, the She's a Hottie wrap and the nachos. We didn't care for the nachos. Everything else was good, but not great. The menu seems to be more limited than it has been in the past.  Love the mason jars. I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could."}
{"text":"The highlight was that there was no cover for ladies. Everything else was kind of....weird. The service was bad; we waited for a long time at our table and again at the bar. The food was average and the drinks were more expensive than what I'm used to. There was live music which was nice. Overall, it felt uncomfortable. I won't be back but to each his own!"}
{"text":"Slowest. Service. EVER. Came here on a Sunday night, so it wasn't exactly busy. Took about 45 minutes to be seated, although there were several empty tables.  Server was super friendly, just not the greatest at her job. Food was just ok... Not bad, but not great. I had the Grilled Chicken Wrap, and I probably wouldn't order it again if I came back (which I probably never will). The water is super chlorine-y, so yuck. Fries were pretty tasty however. Took about another 30 minutes to get/pay our bill. Sorry Toby Keith - can't say that I love this bar...."}
{"text":"Place is horrible the \"waitress\" that was supposed to be waitressing felt that she needed to add her own tip to the bill since my tip wasn't good enough.  I was once a server and took pride in it. The  \"waitress\" we had, had none! Since when is it allowable to create ur own tip as a server?! I called to complain and I was redirected to a tool company, how weird is that. I'll never go there again, steak was good but horrible service, and since it's getting late I'll continue my review another day cuz I have to wake up early for work. Poor service!!! To be continued..."}
{"text":"I really do LOVE this bar! In my opinion this is the best bar around, and after last call you can just head on down to the Carnival Court which is open later!

You can order your drink in a mason jar for $19. Seems pricey, but considering most drinks in Vegas are about $12 this is a really good deal. 

Every time I go there is a fun band playing, and in between sets the DJ will play a mix of music (not just country.) If you are lucky enough you will be there on a night where locals lead line dancing. 

Overall this is a really fun place and my favorite spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Thought it was a good bar until only ONE of the SIX  bartenders came to ask if he could get us anything  - we were there for 4 hrs and while trying to get the bartenders attention, they would look at us and keep trying to close..at 12:30am). And then the drink was bad. I asked for a white russian and it tasted like straight 2% milk. Then when they were kicking people out (at 1:40) we couldn't use the patio OR the bathroom. 
The men working there had the worst customer service I've ever experienced with them being verbally RUDE yelling to customers to \"shit on the pot or get the fuck out\".. And it was surprising that it wasn't just the \"muscle men\" but 95% of them were treating customers this way. Like they were all on steroids and pissed at the world (they even walked away from cleaning to come outside and talk loud shit and point fingers at someone)
Such a nice bar if there was only decent workers there."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and both times I went here with high expectations and both times I left dissappointed. The ambiance is cool and country but the service is lacking. The food is not neccessarily bad, but its not top notch by any means."}
{"text":"I'm not a country western fan and I don't know who Toby Keith is other than someone my girlfriend was drooling over. But I do know that country-western people know how to eat, so I was all up for visiting this bar/grill while we visited Vegas. 

It's inside Harrahs on the strip. 
It didn't open until 11 which was a bit annoying, considering how hungry I was at 10 am, but eventually it did. Like many chains, there is a feeling of \"same old same old\" the moment you walk in, just like any Jimmy Buffet Margaritavilles or a Applebees. 

There was lot of country music and videos on the TV, mostly Toby Keith, and there are bra's hanging around the bar. A country western bar for sure! There is a stage for live music. The cool thing to do is order your beer in a giant mason jar (just Coors for the mason jar only). I hate Coors but I figured when in Rome....

The next day we popped by once again so she could get some souvenirs from the gift shop and pose with the cut-out photo of Toby. We did order up some chili fries and they were delicious which confirms my theory that the food here must be pretty good, in a chain kind of way. Hot and fresh and plentiful. Overall it lacks an original feeling. But I do plan to hit one up in Phoenix next time, so it did its job, but I'll avoid the Coors. Yuck."}
{"text":"I only gave this place 3 stars because they have live country music bands perform there each night (bands that were chosen directly by Toby Keith himself supposedly).  The band was great the night I was there and the bar is nice and large, almost the size of a dance hall.  It's located on the 2nd floor of Harrahs, which is something most people need to know when trying to find this place.  Otherwise, I was not a big fan of this place simply because the domestic beer prices for BOTH bottle and draft were $7 EACH.  I can buy an entire six pack for that price!!  Since it was probably the last time I would ever visit Vegas again in my lifetime, I sucked it up and stayed for a little while.  However, I wouldn't go back.  Since there are very few good choices for country music bars in Vegas, I would recommend this place for those who are desparately looking for a country music bar in Vegas and don't mind paying $7 per beer.  They may have a happy hour with lower prices, but I cannot confirm that.  I know the bands start at 9pm each night and Happy Hour is over by then, if there is one at all."}
{"text":"Really delicious burger and drink (toadfish pond or something like that). All around good."}
{"text":"Had a good time here. Serves is good and food is alright! But the music was great! Lots of energy into the night :)"}
{"text":"The food we ordered was alright, but the service was atrocious. There was a larger party seated after us and from that point on, our server seemed to forget any of us even existed (another couple across from us couldn't get his attention either). Ended up having to track down a manager just to get our check and some carryout containers.

In addition to that, it's incredibly dark in there, so much so that even reading the menu was hard to pull off without pressing it to your face.

Also, why are all the female servers seemingly required to wear either backless chaps with their panties completely visible or way too short shorts? Not sure who at corporate made that call, but here's a tip: Let the food be your reason to be there, not some pointless lowbrow nonsense like that.

Honestly, if this was a standalone place outside of a casino, it wouldn't last long with all these issues."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE country music so of course i had to visit Toby Keith! I felt like i was in the south because of the atmosphere and items on the menu. 
I would have given 5 stars but our server was very ditsy and a bit rude. Order the nachos! Bombbb salsa!"}
{"text":"The place was dirty, staff was very slow to serve/take care of customers ( the bar only had about 15 people in it ). We ordered nachos as an appetizer, when they arrived they were cold the chicken tasted like something out of a can the meat I'm assuming was hamburger was bland and had a hint of taco seasoning on it and of course we had nachos without any plates, napkins or silverware......
The total tab two beers and nachos was over $ 35.00 before tip, if you want to see I love this bar for yourself save your money walk in turn around and walk out !"}
{"text":"One of our favorite meals while we were in Vegas. The breading on the mac&chz balls is so flakey and yummy. The chicken on the Caesar salad was great and so was the dressing. The fried Bologna was some of the thickest cut I've ever seen. We had the fried twinkies for desert which had the same amazing breading as the mac&chz balls."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner on Saturday.  The place was not too busy, it had a great feel and there were plenty of workers in the place.  Unfortunately, none of them wanted to come take our order and none of them seemed to be too happy either.

The food was okay but the service was horrible!  Not going back!  You can find better places all over the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waitress only came to our table twice and the place wasn't even busy. Tried to pay with card but she never came back for our checks so we had to scrounge together enough cash. Had to wait way too long for food and it wasn't even good. Macaroni and cheese tasted worse than easy Mac. Too overpriced for the quality of the food. $8 for a red solo cup of domestic beer."}
{"text":"I had the rib sandwich and it was delicious!  The bar tender did jack me and my friends and didn't return with the tip but it didn't take away from the great food and really cute waitresses."}
{"text":"first of all, i hate country music. can't stand it. and you're wondering, why go here then?! well, i was starving, it was midnite and we were looking for a place to serve their $7.99(?) steak and eggs all day specials.

i want to give more stars cuz i had a great time, but there were still some issues with this place. 

so, we get here at midnite or so on a weeknite. we're waiting in the crazy ass line just to get seated. there were 2 hostesses and they were complete crap. not nice, not friendly, fat women. ugh! not even a smile!!! anyways, we finally get seated. our waiter appeared to be only 1 of 3 waiters in the whole place. our waiter was really nice (a hispanic guy), but it looked like he was serving 10-15 tables (same as the other waiters). totally overworked. those hostesses? just walking around and harrassing our waiter to hurry up. i also work at a business that helps people out. i don't care what your freaking actual job description is. if i was that hostess, i would have helped bus the tables. not stand around gaining more pounds.

anyways, we told our waiter that we wanted the steak and eggs special. we were starving. the food came out so FAST. the steak, of course, was too dry and tough to eat. but, my eggs were made TO PERFECTION (exactly the way i love my eggs!) . the potato hash was awesome and the bread was good. after eating all of that, my stomach was super happy. i didn't eat most of the steak, but i'm ok with that. so freaking cheap.

and the country music?! well, they actually mixed up the country music with some main stream music (Lady Gaga, etc) so it wasn't too bad. even the country music wasn't that bad! shocker! i dunno, but somehow their country music was OK! and i hate country music! lol! 

the steak and eggs special was great, but don't expect high quality for so cheap. 

i might even come here again. even bigger shocker! lol"}
{"text":"This place should seriously just be called Toby Keith Bar. We went there tonight with a very large group of people, families, but the kids were aged between 14 and 20. We dropped down a combined $800 to $1000 on food and drinks. The food was just ok, I ordered the pulled pork which tasted ok but was a bit soggy. We were got there at about 9 pm and ate and then were just hanging out listening to the music and dancing. All of a sudden we are informed but a security gard that the dance floor is part of the bar, even though it is in the restaurant, and that our teenage girls had to get off the dance floor. Keep in mind they are all real dancers and not drunks staggering around with a beer in their hand and it is hard for them to hear music and not be compelled to do what they do best. 

Anyway in the end after complaining that we did not think a restaurant that allowed families should have this sort of policy banning their customers from dancing, we were basically escorted out of the restaurant by the security as the manager didn't want to deal with our argument. Punch line to this story. Toby Keith's is not a Grill but a Bar with food (bar food) and if you have kids well they will take you hard earned money but they really don't want you there, best to not go!"}
{"text":"The food was overpriced, even for the strip and if you don't hit happy hour the drinks are too expensive as well...that said they have some great bartenders who are probably the best flair tenders i've ever seen. That and the staff make you feel welcome..a nice change on the Strip from the cattle line mentality of most places.Overall, a mixed bag, but just edges into the three stars range..."}
{"text":"I've got to give credit where credit is due. I had previously not had a very good experience with the service and average food we received on our first visit here, but we tried it again with family after the holidays because of the fun atmosphere. This time it was delicious! I had the BBQ brisket sandwich and it was very good. I will say though, I wish it came with a \"hardier bun\" that wouldn't fall apart as easily. Even then it still had such good flavor. I think there were 11 of us and everyone loved their food. I'm glad we have this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great food! Great music! Couldn't be happier with my dinner. The prices are good for the amount of food they give you. The beer was super cold and the service was good also. I would like to come back here very soon."}
{"text":"I had the flatiron steak with fries and a baked potato. The baked potato was the best part of the meal. The steak had a taste I can't identify, maybe old meat? The fries were kindof cold and gross. The staff was extremely friendly, the kitchen needs some help."}
{"text":"horrible, horrible experience!!! Service was the worst ever! We got sat at a table and it took the waitress at least 10 min to take our drink orders. When she came back we placed our food orders and got an appetizer. That took at least another 15-20 minutes! (all we ordered was chips and salsa w/ queso dip..not much prep required). We finally got our entrees and asked for some ranch, more water, and a soda. Ranch was brought to our table AFTER we had already finished eating and refills were never brought! Not only the service sucked but I was NOT impressed by the food for how pricey everything was! Such a disappointing experience for such a big name. Definitely wont be going back there!!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent guest at the Caesar's Hotels.  I love this bar.  I found the food good, the drinks thirst satisfying and the service outstanding.   Since I dropped $2K on the blackjack tables, I have no axe to grind."}
{"text":"We gotten the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp & Grits and the Jambalaya Pasta, both wasnt even really cooked at all. If you ever wanna get food poisoning you got a place to go to. Im never going back, it ruin lunch for me and my date."}
{"text":"I was roped into going here as part of a cousins birthday party, and after checking the reviews I knew I was in for a special night.

The wait was long, the servers paid little attention to the tables, and half of the parties orders came to the table incorrectly prepared.

Also what's with the GIGANTIC buns? They almost made the burgers inedible.

Also, I understand that it's a Toby Keith bar, but I was not prepared to be inundated by the same 3 song Toby Keith playlist over and over.
But hey, at just the waitresses are walking around in their underwear.

Tldr: expensive, slow, and mediocre food."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite bars to hang out in while in Vegas! It is always fun with dancing, flare bartenders, mason jars, and birthday \"shots\". 

I actually prefer to come here during the day because most of the bartenders are really personable and you get a really cool show while they throw bottles around and pour 20 shots at a time in a pyramid. They are able to talk with you moer and spend more time showing off their cool tricks than they are at night when it is super busy. AND they still play the Toby Keith song, \"I Love This Bar\" during the day- which means free shots! 

I keep coming back to this place despite the fact that I am not that big into country music and I absolutely despise Toby Keith. So, that really says something about how fun this bar is!

Last note, go on your birthday and order the birthday shot. Trust me :)"}
{"text":"Nice, clean and friendly place. Ordered Turkey club on wheat, which came with fries and a pickle spear. Food was good. Diet Pepsi served in a huge mason jar. The band that played was LOUD, and they were on the other side of the restaurant. I would recommend this place without hesitation."}
{"text":"Good food and great drinks in a Country themed environment.  If you like Country music, you will love this bar.  I am a business executive and I travel to Vegas about 5 times per year over the last 10 years or so.  I stumbled into Toby Keith's about 5 years ago, and I can honestly say it is the one place I look forward to going to every trip.  It doesn't disappoint.  It feels like home even though I'm from the O.C. and I'm not a huge Country fan.  My man Jay Bird has always made the experience fun at the bar.  He's a great guy to have a laugh with.  He makes drinks with this whole flair process with bottles and tumblers and glasses flyin' every which way before it all lands cleanly in your glass.  Very entertaining.  I usually go here in the evening, but this week I decided to have lunch here.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, Mac & Cheese balls, and the tortilla soup.  In the background, I was entertained by Toby Keith's mostly hilarious music videos.  Food came reasonably fast.  The food was really good. Unexpectedly good.  I washed that down with a mason jar of my favorite beverage and I felt like I had great experience for a reasonable value."}
{"text":"Worst service Ive seen in a long time....My family came into town for christmas. Ive had bad experiences here before with service and I warned them but they wanted to see Toby Keiths. We ended up going two days in a row. The first day the service was pretty bad, my family had to go to the bar twice to get their drinks and the server would disappear in the back and wouldnt come out. We wouldnt have came back but we wanted to watch Sunday football and BJ's Brewery couldnt hold the size of my party in the bar. We went back to Toby Keiths and we didnt think it would be that bad two days in a row, it was worse!! The girl serving us sat at the front entrance and talked to her friend the whole time we were there. We repeatedly had to go to the bar to get drinks. Even after complaining to the bartender NOTHING was done. Save your money save your time"}
{"text":"Just like his song \"Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, I love this bar.\"  Drinks are cold and the bar tenders are awesome.  I saw the sign for this walking around and as I passed by so I decided to go in because it was one of the places that did not allow smoking and they had a love band playing Toby Keith songs.  It was a great time and the place being in the back of the hotel was jumpin....."}
{"text":"Food is good but it used to be better. Also seams the menu has gotten smaller. We still enjoy going to TK for the bands and dancing.  Bartenders are great and we always have a good time. Good mix of people, older and young crowd."}
{"text":"Loved the Toby Keith bar!  We had a good time sitting at the bar watching football.  The service was better than expected.  The drinks are awesome and are served in huge mason jars!"}
{"text":"me and my mate went here as a spare of the moment decision I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with fries and it was good but nothing really popped apart from the waitresses they were really nice and helpful gotta love them uniforms definitely a restaurant for the lads"}
{"text":"Girls in cowboy hats and chaps, drinks in mason jars, great country music on the radio.....
so far so good!
The food was half decent (expensive though, like most restaurants in casinos), the portions are very generous, decor was quite nice.   
We enjoyed ourselves.   We'd probably go back on our next trip there."}
{"text":"Group of 8 and had no desire to seat us!! Did not want to let us split up I to 4 and 4. Wanted to put us all on one check!! Not toe room receptionist was pushing 50 in buttless chaps!"}
{"text":"Food was great, employees were a treat, music was entertaining, but no Toby Keith. Was worth it."}
{"text":"The worst meal I had in Vegas. 
That's disappointing because I like Toby Keith. But I can unequivocally say, I hate this bar. 
We had been out all day sightseeing and we needed a decent supper before bed. Harrah's has a bar that is themed after a Toby Keith song. I love this bar. So it looked kind of slow but there were folks eating at several tables. We have eaten at several of the restaurants  in the casino and they've been good. We got seated as we walked up and the waiter came and took our order. Hot wings for her and Fish and chips for me. When they brought her wings they left off the ranch. My order was complete but not completely fried. The breading on the cod fish was not crisp. It was soggy and a little runny on the inside. I took a bite and it was super hot temp wise. But the whole thing fell apart like it had been dunked in water. All of the fish were like this. The fries and slaw were good. As far as the wings went. They were still partly frozen. I grabbed the tip of the wing on one and it was literally cold to the touch. After spending the day in death valley, I'm very aware what hot vs. cold is. This was poor execution of what should be a simple fried order. 
One more thing. The sweet tea was way too sweet. Don't get me wrong,  I love sweet tea. I'm a southern guy and I've had sweet tea since I was 3 probably. I like it sweet. But not this sweet. Maybe you shouldn't even try to be southern, Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow the portions of food were very generous.  We had a table of 7 and we ordered the fried mac n cheese as an appetizer.  I would have never tried this if it weren't for someone at the table that said you gotta try this!  It was very good indeed!  No one was able to finish thier food except two at the table that ordered soup.  I ordered 1/2 order of Nachos that looked like it could serve 3 for sure!  My friend orderd chicken fried steak w/mash potatoes & gravy and it looked great and he said it was very good. The chicken & dumpling soup, tortilla soup also looked great and my friends both finished and loved it.  Alcoholic beverages we served in big glass canning jars so the % of alcohol to mixer was week but overall the ambiance and food was great!  Would do it again!"}
{"text":"Based off my experience this past Saturday night, I'd give this little hidden spot five stars. Why? Well, for starters the bartenders were nice. They didn't treat you like they didn't have time for your order. Next, the dance floor was busy but not ...hey, I just going to hold off going to the bathroom because if I leave this 1x1 inch square I've carved out for myself, there is no way in hell I'm getting it back, feeling. Finally, the music! If you think it's solely country music, think again. Maybe it was the band this past Saturday (8/29/15) but they played a wonderful mix of contemporary and old school country, classic rock, old school hip hop (gin & juice, anybody?), and a little 90's rock. 
I had a heck of a time...in a good way. So much so that I think I sang my little heart out to where the next morning I was sounding like Carol Channing (RIP)."}
{"text":"Food was average. Drinks (even non-alcoholic) way over priced. Five dollars for tea or a soda?? Would have given two stars, however loved the band that started at 9PM."}
{"text":"Ok this is the place to go when you are hungry!  Big portions! 
I absolutely love the meatloaf potato bites,  and sweet tea, a must have:) The BBQ burgers the boom! Taste bursting with sweet and spicy the meat prime quality!  
The restaurant has country music and videos playing all around the walls loved it... the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would. Not once did the bar tenders ask if we wanted drink. It took a really long time to order my food.. food was subpar for the price. Take your money and spend it at Ramsey's pub and grill. Been here for an hour and I had to get the servers attention for my ONE drink, to order, and as I write this I still haven't gotten my bill.. I'm a total Rewards member and I gambled on the video poker machines and still no love. I was ready to spend money and the service was subpar. Barring Toby Keith sitting with me for a beer, I'll probably never come back. Take your money elsewhere folks."}
{"text":"I have been here a few previous times and loved it; however, this time I did not! I had my heart set on having the chili burger, but was disappointed that they changed their menu and no longer have it. I ordered another burger and asked for cheddar cheese. They gave me a different burger than what I ordered. The waitress had them cook me the burger I ask for but the new one had swiss cheese instead of the cheddar I asked for. No apologies. The waitress actually thought it was funny I was mad. Won't be back.."}
{"text":"If you want to have a blast of a time in Vegas without a pretentious atmosphere, this is your place! They have a live band from 9 pm - 2 am. Probably the most fun I had the entire time I was in Vegas. 

Pros: fried mac & cheese balls, 32 oz drinks in mason jars, killer dance floor and live band

Cons: hard to get service from the assless chap clad wait staff during dance hours. Gotta muscle your way to the bar unless you're ordering a full dinner."}
{"text":"Well after Ruth Chris was over pack I decided to go here I didn't really like the name but ok so I went there and order my favorite drink Long Island ice tea and bbq and mac and cheese the drinks the big drinks was and chicken was good the Mac n cheese seems like a box food they need to relearn how to cook it but I would go again I jus wouldn't order the Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"I LOVE this bar and grill. The prices are reasonable, the portions are huge and the music is pure Toby and friends. A must see if you have out-of-towners who like country and down home food."}
{"text":"The food was great! The steak sandwich was truly a good steak on bread, unlike some places where they grill a piece of dried leather & add mushrooms. And the fries were excellent.

BUT... As one might expect on the Strip, it's expensive. The $15 price tag on my dinner was expected, but I felt like I'd just lost big in Vegas at the sticker shock of paying $7 for a domestic beer and $12 for a small margarita. Oh... And there is a lot of ass-cheek in the room provided by your waitresses who put Hooter's girls to shame. I guess you'll have to decide for yourself whether that's a plus or minus... 

Can I say \"ass-cheek\" on Yelp?"}
{"text":"Facts about me:
I am from a large, northern city.
I do not own a cowboy hat or boots
I do not own a pickup, or other large SUV
I do not listen to country music
I sort of enjoy Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill

Maybe it's because it takes SO LONG to find the place that I was just really hungry/thirsty, but I found myself having a good time here.  The food isn't anything outstanding, but after all the glitz of Vegas, it's a nice \"loaded nachos and beer\" breather.  We were there on a weekday afternoon and the place was dead, so service was very attentive.  No clue what it's like on a busy night."}
{"text":"Where is the negative one star?

I've not been here in years but to say service has been degraded is an understatement.

We waited 10+ minutes at the bar for service and even then it was sketchy. One bartender spent the entire time fraternizing with two patrons while we and others waited without drinks or service.

The \"free\" cornbread was stale and dry, worth every cent it cost. The butter was good but limited.

The bartender recommend the fried mac and cheese which I love but these things were near tennis ball size and tasted horrible, not recommended.

I had to ask for another drink twice and it wasn't even busy.

The strange thing is the butter that came with the corn on the cob was hard and tasteless, not sure why they didn't use the same butter they had with the cornbread is beyond me, at least that was good.

Horrible experience. Service sucked and the food was horrible, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Of all of the things we did in 3 nights, this was the best! Friendly bar staff, reasonable prices. Very good band the night we were there. People watching was excellent! The line dancing and country music was worth it all! We had 2 orders of wings, they were very dry.  Also, it would have been nice for someone to pick up our food after we were done eating. The drinks in Mason jars and atmosphere are what gave it such high ratings. Food not so much."}
{"text":"I waited longer for a table than I would have expected given that the place wasn't quite full. The food was very slow to arrive, as well. 

The Cajun Shrimp appetizer was decent -- a large portion, served hot, with a tasty dipping sauce. I believe the menu description is inaccurate in that the shrimp itself is not spiced at all. Not to say it's bad, just not what I was expecting.

The veggie wrap -- admittedly, not what most patrons are going to order in the land of excess that is Las Vegas -- was awful. The filling was about 95% shredded lettuce, with a few other bits of stuff thrown in for color, and a dressing that was not so much bland as just yucky. I considered sending it back, but it was nearly the only thing on the menu that didn't used to have hooves. By which I mean, I didn't have a lot of vegetarian-ish choices.

The service was slow throughout the meal, and the waitress had a habit of timing her drive-bys when I had a mouthful of food and couldn't say anything. As fast as she was moving, you'd think she'd make it back around more frequently, but no. Don't let your drink glasses get empty, as you'll be sitting there thirsty for a while.

All that said, the setting is lively, especially later at night when there's a band on stage. I'm not a fan of country or western, but I'd watch just about any good band live. 

If you're just going for a quick meal, you're better off elsewhere (e.g. next door at Imperial Palace there's a decent homestyle mexican place)."}
{"text":"Fun bar! Had live cover band and DJ Friday night. Drinks are light on alcohol.  But band was entertaining."}
{"text":"Always a good time..Bands are hit or miss. Better on the weekends. Best pours when you order at the bar."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Friendly service!  Cute outfits . Good atmosphere. Great music. Easy to find via monorail."}
{"text":"I went here twice on my last trip to Vegas and it is now going to be a stop I make every time I go down.  The first time was midday, probably around 3 in the afternoon and the place was dead but I wanted to go in for a drink.  They bartenders were friendly.  They temped me by putting a menu in front of me, where by boyfriend spotted the \"Fried Bologna Sandwich\" that he just HAD to try.  So we ordered it... and now I have a new favorite food.  The sandwich was AMAZING, and I don't even like bologna.  I would recommend it in a heartbeat. I also got some specialty margarita and it was delicious.  We went back the following night, probably around midnight and there was a band and the place was packed.  We had a great time dancing and having some drinks.  The beers in a mason jar are classic.  We bought two from the bar to take home."}
{"text":"This bar and grill is alway a must when we come to Vegas for the finals rodeo! (With the exception of this year because of the babe). It has such a fun vibe. They even have a live band every so often. The drinks are great and they have such a wide variety of them. The staff is very friendly and have great music playing!"}
{"text":"Good not great. Typical burger type place that is country music themed. There are TVs all over the place so if you want to watch the sports games it's available. I've been here a couple times and service is hit and miss and isn't very consistent. I guess it's the luck of the draw of who your waitstaff is. Food was fresh the burgers were large and tasty. I had the grilled chicken bbq salad and it was huge. Make sure you have a large appetite. Drinks were expensive 6 dollars for a bottle of domestic beer."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with my wife, with the hopes that this would provide the best service......wrong! 

She is  active duty, so she inquired about the free burger. Well after 20 min of waiting on drinks.. (7 people in the entire place), the bartender says \" I have give you 20% off but not a free burger cause your ordering the 18 dollar one and not the 17 dollar one\". Offered to pay the dollar difference but no dice. Anyway, got ignored for service for the rest of the time we were there, bartender was busy hitting on a lady at the other end of the bar, in which several people that tried to order ended up walking out. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a conference and took 4 of my teachers to I Love This Bar! Service, food and drinks were great! Music and the videos were fun as well. Only thing keeping it from a 5 Star review is the servers dressed in chaps showing their ass. I mean this is not hooters is it? The servers can dress sexy without dressing like Vegas showgirls."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I placed a large order to-go and the food came out pretty fast. Once we started eating though... Oh boy... A couple meals were decent BUT we had a couple issues. 

American Soldier Burger: had tough, bone-like pieces in it. Coworker about broke his tooth. When we called and informed the restaurant, they told us we could bring it back. 

Chicken and Dumpling soup. BLAND. Not like grandma's at all!!! It's made with biscuits, not actual homemade dumplings. Tasted like garlic biscuits. 

I personally would not order from here again.  The server was very friendly, but the food overall was not impressive."}
{"text":"If you love country, this is the place in Vegas for you!

My boyfriend surprised me and took me to Vegas for my birthday and it was my first time at the Toby Keith bar. I'd heard about it from friends who loved it and I sure loved it too. The bar is very big with lots of tables and a dancing area to dance to the live band. I didn't get any food since we all just wanted to get drinks. The staff was friendly and served quickly. The music is loud and the drinks are strong! They're a little expensive but I guess it makes sense since they're served in huge mason jars. Seriously they're huge and really heavy and I'm not complaining. I got a long island for $30 in a big mason jar and it's totally worth it.

We stayed for quite a while dancing until a little after the band took a break. This place has a great vibe and an awesome atmosphere. I'll definitely be returning when I come back to visit."}
{"text":"Thank god this place finally closed down.  Now that it's over, I hope the management and the customer relations guy can re-read the comments here and learn from their mistakes.  On a personal note, I thought the food was ok, the service was very slow, and the atmosphere was too crowded during peak hours.  What really bothered me was the doormen/bouncers.  Every single guy going into this establishment had to lift up their shirt and then get patted down.  If the clientele coming here are so violent that this is necessary, then it's not a safe place to be (I would never bring my family or loved ones to such a place!).  If it's not that violent/dangerous, then why in the world are customers being treated this way?  I can't think of any place on planet earth that has public quasi-strip searches for everyone in line.  If you know the bottom of the barrel ghetto people will be flocking to your establishment, discourage them... don't encourage them by offering ladies night with 50 cent drinks.  DUH.  Nightmare."}
{"text":"I liked the bar and the drinks .... But I found it ridiculous that me abd my friend were told to put our shirts inside out because they said,chilly bombers assuming,I was promoting which we were not , I was asked about threes times but told 4 times I was aloud to wear it . we ended up lifting our shirts up cause I wasn't about to leave my friends going away party because y'all were throwing a fit.... and sorry to tell you it just drew more attention to US and 12 of your customers found it dumb you made us hide our shirts and they came to chilly bombers thanks guys !!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service , awesome atmosphere! I had the grilled chicken spinach wrap with ranch BBQ sauce home-made coleslaw and a garlic pickle spear---all very fresh and delicious! Will visit again on my next trip back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here today, and had been here a few years ago, and this trip was very disappointed.  I wanted a salad and there was not much to choose from, (or anything else) on the menu.

I ordered the build yourself salad which stated it was the ranch salad and then you add on grilled chicken, fried chicken or shrimp, I got the fried chicken, it was supposed to have cucumbers, red onions, tomatoes, cheese & roasted corn on it.

It was mostly all iceberg lettuce, there was hardly any chicken, no cucumbers or onions and barely any corn & onions and to boot it was $14.99.

I felt it was a rip off, the worst salad I have had for a long time.

My husband ordered the All American Burger, which came on a big bun, but the meat didn't even touch the edges of the bun, he said it was not very tasty, and it cost $13.99.

Will not be returning here again, too high price for under average food."}
{"text":"Servers look you in the eye then ignore you when you are the only customer standing at the bar wanting a drink. Incredibly, egregious customer service."}
{"text":"Good wings and Nachos. The Catfish was overrated. After we were seated it took 15 minutes before anyone came to take our order or even acknowledge us. Several staff members walked by and did not check on us. I wont return."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is great! But the servers are SO rude I had to go with 1 star. We had a group of 7. 1 person, who ordered a 20$ drink, wasn't hungry so the servers told her she needed to sit in the bar while the rest of us ate. For 7 people to order over 200$ I expect better service. I'm really disappointed because this is one of my favorite stops."}
{"text":"Honestly, I did not know who Toby Keith until I actually looked him up on the Internet while we were dining.

When we are in Las Vegas, I often pick the place to eat when I am with my family.

However, this time around, since we were Casino hopping via the Monorail; I capitulated to the group's choice.

We normally eat at the other establishments and we don't go to Bar & Grills. But since everyone was famished, and they wanted to eat NOW, they chose the closest restaurant to our stop.

We were greeted by the hostess as we walked through the entrance. She was very pleasant and nice. This seemingly impromptu choice by my family seemed like it would turn out to be a good choice. The place was brightly lit, clean, spacious, and there were not that many patrons so we had plenty of great seats to choose from.

The hostess grabbed the menus, exited from the booth that she was situated in, and led us to our table. Now, the punch line here is that as we followed her; none of us could help but notice the fact that she was wearing chaps and nothing was covering her rear except for very small (and nearly non-existent) panties.

Well, this was a great choice - Family!? I had this perplexed look on my face, as I stared onto my wife's and daughter's grinning faces!

Derrière's aside, and there was plenty of it, the food and the service were actually not bad. Our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our needs.

I had the All American Burger, that this monstrosity of a sandwich could've fed all of us. It seemed as if the quoted weight of this burger was post cooking, because It definitely was too big to hold with one hand - let alone put any part of it in my mouth.

My wife had the Ribeye, and she indicated that it was well seasoned, and properly prepared.

The rest had various sandwiches, BBQ Beans, and Mac & Cheese. Everything tasted good.

This seemingly humorous departure from our normal dining venues proved both fun, relaxing and surprisingly satisfying. And by the time we were ready to leave, the lights were dimmed and the crowds started to roll in. Apparently, after a certain time, there is a band that plays on the stage, and country dancing ensues.

We didn't stick around for that, but we left satisfied!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and fun place but food was very mediocre. I ordered the sirloin medium and it came out a bit over poked and quite rubbery. Catfish could have certainly been cooked longer for better crisp and color. Sides were small and their green beans were not seasoned at all. Presentation of the dishes were very thrown together and as soon as you see the dish, you know you're going to be let down. For a good time and drinks, I would recommend. For a good meal, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good....waitress was nice and helpful but the price was alittle high and main dish (steak and ribs)  were cold.
We live close so we will be back and try it again"}
{"text":"Tried the nachos, sweet potato tots, and complimentary corn bread. YUM!! Service was pretty good as well.  Over all very tasty.  Agree with eye candy comment. Ha ha."}
{"text":"I ordered a vegi wrap and fries to go, got back up to the room and found they didn't include the fries (which I watched him ring up as an extra charge). If you charge $23 for wrap and fries I expect it to be good... disappointing."}
{"text":"Tito was awesome at the bar. He was very friendly and fun to talk to. Beer was yummmmmm and the portobello burger was the bomb!!! Sheeesh I totally forgot to take a pic of the best burger ever."}
{"text":"I'd say skip the meal but stop in for beer (before they charge the cover).  Bartenders and nice and FINALLY BOYtenders - Wow - just sayin - fun if you are really into country - band was doing sound check for what seemed like an eternity.  Take out of towners if you're looking to people watch."}
{"text":"The name should be \"I love this bar\" nix the grill part.

As a bar this place is pretty good. The wait, service and food sucks.

We put our name in for dinner and were told 45-60 minute wait. Twenty minutes into our wait Robby Gordon shows up and they slip him right in front of everyone.

At the fifty minute mark I asked where we were on the list, we were told 15 more minutes.

At the 90 minute mark we were finally seated.

We got our drinks pretty quick then it took another 15 minutes for our server (Lisa) to take our order.

In all we had two cheese burgers, one chili burger, two waters, one iced tea and a lemon drop martini. The bill came to $60.00. My chili burger had zero flavor. Which begs to ask \"how do you screw up a chili burger\"? Well this place knows how.

Like I said at the beginning, good bar...horrible restaurant. Never again.

Toby Keith needs to remove his name from this place...quickly."}
{"text":"I appreciate Toby Keith's musical ability, but if this restaurant is any indication of his culinary skills, he needs to hang em up. This place is horrible. Server recommended the steak, it was bad quality, mac and cheese was a step above Kraft. Pepsi products as well. My wife's nachos were literally inedible,  she had to send em back which she never does. If we hadn't had a free meal coupon from a timeshare thing, we never would have come after seeing the reviews, and now even with the coupon we wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Fun. Good value. Good southern comfort food. Enjoyed the chicken fried steak.  mac and cheese very cheesy which means a lot to someone from Wisconsin. Good burger and fries. Good drinks--definitely had sufficient alcohol.  Unlike many LV joints.  Would def go back."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place unless you enjoy over paying for bland mediocre food. I'm giving this establishment a 2 for the great music, decor, & the hostess. 
3 out of 4 of us enjoyed our food. We had the mac & cheese balls appetizers, they were so bland kraft mac & cheese has more flavor.
For dinner, my son ordered the American Soldier, his friend ordered the cat fish, my boyfriend ordered the chicken fried steak, & I ordered the western burger. The burgers looked & smelled great but were so bland & tasteless, not even adding ketchup, salt & pepper could save it or even give it flavor. I think McDonald's is horrible & even then a big Mac has more flavor. The chicken fried steak was also bland & tasteless, where again salt & pepper could not save."}
{"text":"We arrived at Toby Keith's on a Sunday night with our little family of 4. (2 adults & 2 tweens) 

They had just opened for dinner and were moving pretty slow. The outfits that this place makes these ladies were is just disgusting. I am not saying that because I am a women, cause don't get me wrong I am happy to check out a nice T & A with the hubby but one of these girls was absolutely disgusting to even look at. Tits were about to fall out of her shirt and they weren't nice to look at. 

We ordered the largest appetizer which was really good. Youngest ordered a soldiers hamburger, oldest ordered the top sirloin, hubby ordered the two meat dinner meal and I ordered the chicken fried steak. 

Everything was good EXCEPT the chicken fried steak. It was disgusting. I couldn't even attempt to eat it which of course pissed me off since this place is not cheap in the least. 

Waitress came back and I told her I didn't care for it at all she said I wish you would have told me earlier, it was the first time she came back to the table since she dropped our food off. 

Walked out spending $103 on dinner with a $15 tip and won't be returning."}
{"text":"This bar ought to be shut down just for the bad time it provides"}
{"text":"Food arrived cold and took a very long time; not very impressed. The best part about this place is the waitresses wearing chaps."}
{"text":"Yes Tobey, I love this bar also. Probably not as much as you since you're the one making money but whatever, I'll contribute to your wealth as long as I have a good time doing it.

Come here pretty much every time I visit Vegas and stay at Harrah's cause I like the proximity and the atmosphere. Best thing about this bar is the menu: Southern Food.

The menu is varied but I get the same thing almost everytime, a fried bologna sandwich, or as I like to call it: Welfare steak. a big ole slice of bologna with fried onions and cheese on toasted bread. Comes with either fries or tater salad. Where I come from, we put mustard in the tater salad but Tobey don't so I'm not crazy about it. It's ok, just not great.

The wife likes to order side dishes like fried okra, pickles, mac n cheese balls, and meatloaf. This time, along with a couple of sides, she ordered the Chicken n Dumplings soup. First time she ordered this and wasn't crazy about it. She said it didn't have enough dumplings in it.

I have no idea why she ordered this. She makes the best chicken n dumplings I ever tasted which is why I never order any anywhere.

Ok, usual complaint but not really complaining. The price is a little high but remember, this is Vegas 2016. You're not paying $3.99 for prime rib like back in the Rat Pack days. Any other city I would never pay $13 bucks for a bologna sandwich but you're here so don't complain and enjoy.

(Come to think about it, where else you going to get a fried bologna sandwich other than Dollywood?)

Live music and live crowds, free shots at the bar when the bell rings, and lot's of fun."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Try the \"who's ur daddy\" margarita served in a mason jar!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place , just needs a little more fine tuning on the management side . The food is typical bar food , I like the mason jar drinking glass concept. The entertainment is the big seller here , with Toby Keiths name on the marquee ."}
{"text":"I don't know who is more awesome, the bartenders, the live band or the Canadians fucking with each other at the next table... But I love this bar."}
{"text":"We were staying at Harrah's and Mike wanted to go to a sports bar to watch a particular football game on a Sunday afternoon, so we ended up at Toby Keith's. We sat at the bar and I kept myself occupied with the video poker games at each seat. A very hungry Mike ordered a pulled pork sandwich and we got some Jack cocktails to tide us over. My drink was pretty strong, which certainly alleviated my losing streak at video poker. The food took at least 20-30 minutes to come out even though the bar was pretty much empty. I liked how they put your food on a cutting board if you're sitting at the bar. The portions weren't as big as I thought they would be given the prices they charged. Our server/bartender pretty much ignored us after Mike got his food so we hightailed it to Harrah's sports bar to watch the game."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, this is not Toby Keith's this is a Chevy's with his name on it. During dinner no country or western music rather U2, Neil Young and Queen felt totally detached from what I thought I was doing. Supporting the restaurant because he is one of the few headliners with the balls to perform inauguration. Food ok, drinks great no Toby Keith spirit blah."}
{"text":"Although I consider myself a person with finer tastes, Toby Keith's place (I don't like the actual name and I just call it \"Toby Keef's place\" in conversation) became a hot spot among my group of friends. If you stay in Harrah's, it's very tempting after you've spent all day on your feet. The prices are similar to an Applebee's except for the booze. On busy nights, the bartender will stand on the bar and pour shots into everyone's mouths. I wouldn't do it because a) germs! and b) it was a mysterious orange liquid that probably wasn't gin.

The food was adequate. The fried mac and cheese pleased our group and I liked the fried twinkies. But nothing stood out as something I'd end up craving back home.

They only run the mechanical bull Thursday through Saturday nights, but they made an exception for our group (it helps to be a dozen 21+ girls, I suppose). I was the first to ride it that night, but after watching gross chicks grind against it ('That's not a good way to stay on...' I thought to myself), I think maybe I don't want strange crotch sweat on me? Maybe not. Well, Chippendales crotch sweat is fine, but Toby Keef place crotch sweat, no."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time here.  We did not eat here but had drinks.  The long time house band was great!!

Another trip to Vegas (2/10-11) and 2 trips to Toby Keith's.  The 1st night, we had dinner and a few drinks.  The food was so-so but the bartender, James was great.

We returned the next night (Saturday) and had a great time.  The band, Tony Marques Band, is great, but their 2nd set was mostly U2, Uptown Funk, Funkytown, etc.  Not what you would expect from a band at a country western club.  That being said, we still love listening to the band.

We sat at the bar and J.J. was our bartender.  She is awesome.  Very personable and outgoing.  Fun to watch.  When my wife and I went out to dance, we returned to the bar and found that she had taken a napkin and wrote, gone dancing' on the napkin and hung it over our beers so that no one would take our spot at the bar.

We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Since my mom is a big Country music fan and Toby Keith advocate, this was a must stop for her when we visited Vegas. To be honest, I was not pleased one bit by this place. When we received our menus we were told that a lot of the items on the menu couldn't be ordered because they didn't have the product's yet to make said items. Why the hell use your new menu if you don't even have the ingredients to cook it? The only reason I give two stars is because our waitress was nice and gave us free shots for it being my 21st birthday."}
{"text":"We ate several meals in Vegas and the one at I love this bar was the absolute best! We arrived just a bit before 9pm and at 9pm a live band started. Plenty of room for line dancing and awesome music. I had the bbq chicken salad that was full of flavor and fresh. The fried pickles are fried in a beer batter and a killer dipping sauce. The nachos with bbq pork were phenaminal and the special sangria burger was even better. Our waitress Michelle was the most friendly most energetic person in the place. Would return again and recommend to anyone looking for an amazing deal."}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. Went here for a quick sandwich before going out to the bars. Took almost 30 minutes to bring our food. I had a grilled sandwich wrap. It was so soggy I only are the chicken out of it since I was so hungry. Fries were ok but salty. All my friends had sandwiches or wraps and did not like theirs either. Was not worth the money. The music was good if you like country and they do have a dance floor but would not recommend the food."}
{"text":"We've been here for nearly 1 1/2 hours....still no service.  Came in  excited to watch the Monday Night Bronco game.....starving and thirsty.  Don't want to leave because of the big screen....but not sure if we can hold out until the end of the game to eat.  Talked to the manager 20 minutes ago who said he would send someone right over.  Still no one."}
{"text":"ok... please for the love of god do not ever order the wings here... besides the fact this restaurant creepily has like 50 pictures of toby keith staring into your soul, the feeling you get when you walk in is strange... my thoughts were... jeez this really feels like an airport restaurant... not to mention the uniforms were a bit strange.  but lets get to the food... my dad and i split the wings and they were awful... im not going to lie.... i have wings probably 5 out of the 7 days of the week... i know... im a picky eater... but this should prove to you that the wings are god awful... TOBY U NEEDA GET THIS PLACE UNDER CONTROL. the fact that this place was dead during the college basketball national championship should have really been a sign but somehow my idiot self still decided to come here. i never yelp but i really feel like i need to give you all a fair warning."}
{"text":"Good food, Nice service and a Cool Store on the side. Tons of Toby Keith Memorabilia and the Girls....Wooo!"}
{"text":"Get yourself together Toby. $3 for a draft Busch Light in a plastic cup? I'd rather drink it straight from the goat's penis. 

My food was good. The three stars all go towards it. I had a chicken fried steak with fries and macaroni and cheese. 

There were about 50 TVs in this place all playing country music videos. Every other one was a Toby Keith video. Gag. But what should I expect?

Our waitress was nice, but kind of emasculating as she could grow a better mustache than me."}
{"text":"The portions here are HUGE. I got an appetizer because I wasn't very hungry and I barely made a dent in it. Definitely a cool spot to catch a game while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, staff, drinks and overall experience.  Our only downer was the young lady (on the microphone) announcing when tables were ready was INCREDIBLY LOUD!  She needs a lesson in VOLUME CONTROL!"}
{"text":"After seeing a early show in the establishment it's housed in my friend suggested we go to Toby Keith's for dinner. I didn't know it existed. We sat down and were chatting and catching up on life, the waitress was so patient and friendly and brought us our iced teas. We finally got around to ordering, I was watching the deeeelicious looking food being served around me, every thing looked so good and when I got my dinner \"it was very tasty.\" I felt very comfortable and I enjoyed the atmosphere! The service was fantastic for us! I say \"YUMM\""}
{"text":"Poor food, long wait for service!!!! Stay away."}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 chances, and it ruined my evening every time:(  The food is actually ok, and I do not mind paying a bit extra for the drinks, I even like the bands that have been playing each time I have gone. There are two HUGE issues, the staff and the group they almost have to pay to dance there. I'll start with the dancers, the group was pretty much the same for each visit, and if you even look like you are going to try to dance they glare you back off the floor. They are fun to watch, but rude and territorial. Next the bouncers, I have not met an ax murderer that I know of, but if I did he would be nicer than these guys. They start at the door by frisking you, and never get past treating you like your in prison. I was bumped, pushed, shoved, and grunted at, my husband got the same, only harder and more often. I will not subject myself to this ever again."}
{"text":"Day after Thanksgiving leftover special $20 a good value, friendly bartender, no drink specials, lots of turkey, not easy to eat the sandwich, needed more gravy, fries were a mistake mashed would have been better but the bartender said the fries came with gravy and they did not, dessert was meh, good beer selection but they need to take beers they do not carry off the list, not too clean, tucked away in Harrah's."}
{"text":"This place was exactly what I expected it to be to a T. When I heard the news that my father in law wanted to eat here during our 1st night it Vegas, I was rather uninterested based on all the other options, but it wasn't completely awful. I got tortilla soup for an appetizer and it was pretty good. The table got mac cheese bites that were bland as could be. We also splitting nachos, which again, not the best. The entrees were definitely the best part of the meal, I got a chicken quesadilla that had green chile on it and it was actually decent. Others enjoyed their wraps and burgers. Service was pretty mediocre considering our table were probably 40% of the customers in the place."}
{"text":"Went back after friend wore pants....waste of money slow as hell for service then they messed up a lot of wings then they got confused....I finally got my food after explaining they are idiots the bouncers \"regulators\" arnt too bad the whole shopping center security is annoying which made our night even worse doesn't Toby Keith's have its own security why do they need more? Anyway at least we got in this time disappointed though....."}
{"text":"This should be 2.5 starts. LOOONG wait. Good catfish, but not the best (it was a little mushy). Fries were tasty, and I liked the creamy sauce that was included (it wasn't tartar sauce though). The band was a lot of fun, and the singer kept coming around. He was a good charmer with the crowd.

Although it was a nice time, it wasn't memorable enough to come back."}
{"text":"We were just there for drinks, the service was slow but the live band kept us entertained while we waited. We stuck it out for two drinks but with the poor service left for a different bar. Shots were a little pricier than the other bars on the strip."}
{"text":"I really do LOVE this Bar and Grill!!  We came here while visiting Vegas, and there is nothing wrong with a bar that rings a bell and pours shots directly into your mouth!

We had the nachos, and they were amazing.  I also ordered one of their mixed drinks that came in a HUGE mason jar.  it puts those rinky dink mason jars to shame!!

My friend and I took a few shots before/during the meal, so I thought the food was amazing at the time--that might cloud my review, just FYI.  But the nachos were amazing as was my burger.  And my friends' fries :)

There was a sign outside the door that was a little off-putting, though.  It said there was a 90 minute time limit for diners.  However, we were there for over two hours and our waitress couldn't have cared less!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Your family will love it. They had a live band and a free mouth shot at the bar when \"I love this bar\" comes on."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day and was very disappointed. My mom used credit from Total Rewards to pay for our meal and I believe we got taken. 
I got the turkey club and shared with my wife, who got the Cesar salad. My club had dry turkey, barely crisp bacon and tough toast. Not to mention no mustard, mayo or other sauce to lubricate it down. Disappointing.  My wife's salad had the ends of the romaine in the salad. It was dressed well, but lacked any seasoning. Just ok. 
My brother in law found a piece of paper towel in his chicken fried steak. Yuck!
The topper was that my little girls mac and cheese was grainy and an odd orange. She lives on boxed Mac and cheese but this was just un edible. 
Toby, I was embarrassed for you."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.   Hamburgers were room temperature, dry and bland.  Drinks were tasty! We visit Vegas twice a year. Probably won't visit Toby's again.  He's one of my favorite performers."}
{"text":"This restaurant is turrible. Just turrible. 

The food is garbage and the ambience is aggressively annoying."}
{"text":"I usually stop into this bar when in Vegas.  They usually have live country music and the crowd is out to have a good time.  You can get a huge mason jar full of booze for $15 or beer for $6.  There is at least 8 oz of booze in the jar, so 1 is enough for most non-alcoholics.  

There are 2 massage chairs out front by the bathrooms.  After 1 or 2 a.m. you will see women trying to get orgasms from the vibrating seat. 

Never a cover charge."}
{"text":"We stepped into the Toby Keith Bar this evening at 12:30a, the website did show that it's business hours lasted until 2a; and received by far the WORST customer experience to date. 
We purchased cocktails and within 10 minutes they turned off the music and turned the lights on to begin closing. 
We asked if they were closing early, explained we thought they were staying open until 2a, and the bartender stated, and I quote \"That's what you get for looking at the website! Ya, we're closing. Business is slow so we're done.\" 
All of this was communicated in the most condescending voice/communication that we did not expect from this establishment.
We mentioned our frustration with their communication - none of this aggression and condescending tones were necessary. 
This was followed up with a bartender/bar back yelling across the bar 'If you have a problem with me, get back here and take it up with me'. 
The aggression and complete lack of customer service was over the top and completely unnecessary. 
We would have happily come back the next night, this being our first visit, until your staff aggressively taunted our party and rudely pushed all of their customers out of the door. 
This experience has left a sour taste in our mouth and a disappointing/disrespectful view of this establishments brand. Very disappointed, and all from the managing staff representing your business.
I do hope the Sr Mgt reaches out to rectify this issue. Until then, I highly suggest avoiding this venue unless these actions are what you seek when visiting the Toby Keith Bar and grill."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in a long time. Good happy hour prices on beer but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Before I even went to this restaurant I looked at the online menu since I am fairly picky on what I order at restaurants. I found two good options and made the reservation. When we sat down with the menu I noticed that my first option wasn't on there. I asked the waitress where the prime rib is that's on their website and she said 'oh that's an old menu.' So onto my second item which was the BBQ Rotisserie chicken. Yeah they sold out of that earlier today. I can tell at this point this is not going to go well. I ordered the sirloin medium rare and asked the waitress how the green beans were made. She stated they are cooked in butter and garlic - so I was in. When the dinner arrived my steak was cooked as ordered but had no taste to it. I don't think they seasoned it at all. The green beans had no flavor either. The mashed potatoes were good so that's why they get three stars. We were not impressed and won't be back!"}
{"text":"My very first time in Vegas for my birthday and after walking the strip we decided to come here and we were not disappointed. Service was great, place is clean, the band really kept everyone entertained and the food and drinks were amazing!! I wish they had one close to where we live."}
{"text":"I Love this Bar!

What an amazing place.  The band, the Tony Marquez band, is a group of seasoned performers who sound so tight you wonder why they don't have a top 10 hit.  The bartenders are fully trained Cocktail style, Brandan the acrobat who was pouring drinks on the night we were there was unbelievable.

We closed this place down and still wanted more, if you are looking for some good country fun in Vegas this is the ONLY stop."}
{"text":"Why does Toby Keith have a restaurant? Are they going to open a Elton John pizzeria next? The food here was bad. Just bad and priced high. I don't recommend any of the dishes on the menu. If you're a Toby Keith fan, don't expect him to be cooking in the back and singing songs. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed. Of all the places we went it had by far the slowest and worst service. Food was bland with little taste and way overpriced even for Vegas. Would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Its just your average chain style place.  We had fun because we met up with friends.  Our waitress was nice but in some cases the service was a little spotty and they seemed to try and hustle us out the door.  I actually ordered a salad and I was somewhat nervous about it.  It was actually good and there was no iceburg lettuce to be found....yes!!!!  Maybe I'll be back."}
{"text":"mmm-mmm-mmm, I'm ambivalent about this bar...

On the plus side, we ate here after escaping a shady time-share sales pitch down the hall. We were so happy about getting out of there with our wallets intact that we were giddy to eat here. The bartender said that most of his customers came in straight from the timeshare pitch to get hammered and complain about being suckers.

On the minus side, the food is for suckers. It's overpriced, although a Total Rewards card knocks off a dollar or two, and it's not that good.

On the plus side, the mason-jar sized drink got my wife drunk enough to be very entertaining, but not so drunk that she hit the point of diminishing returns. So the bartender gets props for hitting the sweet spot."}
{"text":"3 of us shared wings and chicken strips and it was more than enough. The wings are whole wings and they give you 8...so for 12 bucks,  receiving 16 true wingettes, there were no complaints here. We got a mixture of plain, buffalo and BBQ and they were good. I think I'd pass on the strips  next time, but the chocolate brownie sundae made up for it. 

Overall 3 stars because our server Dara left us just sitting a couple of times while she listened to the band. For 4.00 per fountain drink,  I needed her to be a little more attentive and at least offer a refill, but that didn't happen.  I'd return though."}
{"text":"I don't know what your attitudes are about Toby's, but i have been there at least 20 times and you guys are so inaccurate.   # 1 the mason jar drinks are $18 not $22.  The service there is one of the best on the strip!!  Awesome and Leo are the best out there....always with a smile and aiming to please.  The food is GREAT and reasonable!!  don't know where else you guys are eating on the strip (maybe  mickey d's)  Where else can you go and get great food and entertainment!!  I LOVE THIS BAR AND GRILL!!"}
{"text":"If you have a choice DON'T DINE HERE. Toby Keith I HATE YOUR BAR & GRILL.

 I would rather stay home and get a third degree burn in my mouth from a Lean Pocket than ever dine at this type of place, but sometimes it's not about what I want. 

It was my sister's birthday and her and my mother love country music and Toby Keith in particular. My mom had mentioned she wanted to take my sister here so I took the bull by the horns and made it happen. Big mistake.

We all know there are outstanding restaurants on the strip that are worth every over priced dime that you spend. Not this one. This falls into the other category. The Over Priced Food That Just Sucks Themed Restaurants.

Still, I can get past the price just to make people I love happy, but not this time. In a nutshell.

The food wasn't terrible. My sister ordered meatloaf potato skins with gravy for our appetizer. This was creative, yet under seasoned, but still I was thinking this would be cool to recreate at home for one of my dinner parties. Maybe with sweet potatoes.

Next we each had a sandwich which does not include fries and my sister added fries. My sandwich was a grilled BBQ chicken sandwich which wasn't terrible at all. I could only eat half and brought the rest of the chicken home to my dog. One Coke, two well drinks and $95 LATER!!!!!!! Fuck me.

Like I said, I can get over the price, but the waitress broke my number one rule. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY AND SHE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR MY SISTER. Not that we expected a lap dance or Toby Keith to serenade us in tight jeans, but something! I made it a point to tip the busser and have her tell the waitress about the birthday (let me say those girls are the ones hustling in this joint) . The waitresses merely take your order and then hand you your check at the end. Other than that they do shit. It's all about the bussers. Our busser  was on point and I know she told the waitress. Well Sue or Suzie our blonde waitress brought me the bill and I mentioned it to her and she just looked at my sister and said, \"Happy Birthday\". I wanted to rip her Lee Press-On nails right off. Well, I tipped her accordingly and then tipped the busser again.

If mediocre, overpriced, under seasoned bar food and country music is your thang than you will be in hog heaven with the trailer park beauties servin' it up. If you are looking to spoil someone you love on their birthday with a simple scoop of vanilla ice-cream and a feckin' candle than do not come here."}
{"text":"If you know Tobys song,  \"I love This Bar\", then this is the place for you.  Food is eh eh, not bad, but nothing great.  The bar is MY bar...I come 2-3 times a year to Vegas just to spend a couple of nights dancing at Tobys.  The music (Tony Marques Band) the bartenders  ( Leo and Jimmy) and the comfortable vibe....I LOVE THIS BAR!!!!"}
{"text":"Tues.Oct 20th,8:30 PM.
So looking forward to the margaritas,
There were four in our party,we were seated.Then since we weren't having dinner  were asked to move to the bar,which we did,but noone ever came to take our orders,so we approached the bar tender who served up the worst gawd awful drinks and charged $15 each.yes they came in a mason jar,but weren't drinkable.stayed until the band was getting ready to start and left.Don't get me wrong I love country music and margaritas.
But the are really desperate to employ such unfriendly people,especially since it's obvious they didn't graduate from a mixology class....no tip,no recommendations,maybe toby should visit and see how he likes it."}
{"text":"We were expecting a Country Western Bar. I think Toby would be disappointed! Waited over 2 hrs to be seated for dinner. While waiting we sat in the Bar area. We got our first Drinks at the Bar. It took the Waitress almost 35mins before she stopped by our table. She never came back. We got our next drinks at the bar while the couple next to us chain smoked. We finally got our table and ordered our food. It took 40mins for the food to come out. I was so hungry at this point I honestly could not tell you if the food was bad. Not trying to be too critical \"Vegas\" but did have different expectations"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here. My Server, Matt, was very good. Friendly and professional. If you liked southern brewed sweet iced tea, which isn't available in the Northeast where I live, you will enjoy it here. I had the fried catfish, coleslaw and fries. Two decent sized catfish fillets that were hot and tasty as hell! Fries were your average fries. Though, I have had better coleslaw. For dessert, I had the pecan pie which was delish! Stop by the Toby store next door too. Plenty of 2XL shirts here to be had."}
{"text":"Good food I got a sloppy joe my husband got a cheeseburger was a little pricey for what your getting but was still good food"}
{"text":"We went here on our first night in Las Vegas.  The Hostess was uninterested, the waiter was ok but, hard to understand,  The food was VERY disappointing.  I had the wings which were soggy and too hard to eat as they were the entire chicken wing (3 sections each).  They were honestly about on par with the frozen wings you get at Sams.  My daughter had the brisket tacos.  She said they were tasteless except for the cilantro on top.  My son had the hamburger with brisket on it and it was pretty tasteless as well. My husband had a hamburger and was not impressed.  Our take was that Toby should stick to singing.  This restaurant is overpriced and the food is below average.  Will not go again."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and have had two similar experiences. 

The first time I was with my wife and the half the food we ordered was disappointing. Unfortunately the ribs were the most expensive and disappointing part of the meal! We shared a huge nacho appetizer and they were good. The server was great.

The second time I was in a group and the food was all average. Nothing stood out and nobody in the group had good things to say when leaving. There was a fair variety of meals ordered from fish and pork to burgers. It was just average chain restaurant food. The server sucked but was wearing assless chaps and underwear. That seems good till she bends over pick up a fork dropped at the table next to you. That is interesting to say the least! 

They do have fair priced drinks. They use mason jars for beers and mixed drinks which is pretty cool. My wife once ordered a mason jar mixed drink for around 14 dollars and it was to strong for her. I tried it and it was on the strong side, but I would rather that than the alternative. 

All in all, I will not return to this location for dinner, maybe for drinks and appetizers at best..."}
{"text":"This bar and grill fed myself and 7 of my military buddies for free! Free burger, fries and beer! Service was amazing, ambiance was very chill and it was a good time!!! Thanks peeps!"}
{"text":"I WANT to give it four stars, but we had a problem at the end.

We ALWAYS go to Toby Keith's - the \"She's a hottie wrap\" is off the charts DELISH. the drinks are huge and the waiter we had - Alfonso, was amazing! No complaints on food or service, but my brother had a Groupon that he showed to the guy in the beginning, and he redeemed it and everything, but he still got charged full price in the end.

We will still come back tho - it is a staple every Vegas trip!!!!"}
{"text":"It is actually closer to a 4 1/2 review but really good bar type food. We ate there twice over the weekend. The first time the food was delivered to the Pool area and my wife and kids ate it while sitting poolside. They got Chicken Strips and Fry's and they split it with 5 people. The batter on the Chicken was light and yet still crunchy and the fry's were great and plenty of them. 

We went back for dinner before heading to the Airport on Sunday evening after a long weekend. Once again the food was fresh and plentiful and the place was packed. I would go to another the next time I see this chain."}
{"text":"I went later on a Thursday, I think haha, night. They had live music which was pretty good. Lots of people, not disgustingly crowded though. The burger was great, huge though!! The bartenders that helped me, Jimmy and Jared, were awesome!! Very attentive. 
A definite go if you like burgers and country music!!"}
{"text":"You know, I was pleasantly surprised after finishing a meal here. So much so that I think I'd actually come back at some point for the food.

My only gripe is that for a country bar, you figure there'd be more beers on draft. Only two; miller lite and coors lite. Bummer!

The nachos weren't bad! I got a semi, but it wasn't a full on rager. Not top quality, but good enough for 3 stars. 

For my entree, I got a chicken wrap that sounded great in theory... deep fried buffalo chicken, onion, guacamole, lettuce, tomato. Too much lettuce, not enough chicken, but the flavor combination was there. Next time I go back, I'll ask for extra chicken in there... then it'll be delicious.

Our waitress Michelle was stunning. My family is ridiculous, so we had a discussion on whether or not her tits were real. I watch a ton of porn and my mother has fake boobs... we both voted real. My dad didn't care, he just wanted to stare at them. 

Also, the waitresses wear assless chaps. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"So disappointed! Service was really slow, a passed out chick puked right next to our table. They had top put her in a wheelchair. Nor even a \"Im sorry\" from any of the employees. The best part of my jalapeño burger was the grilled fresh jalapeño on top."}
{"text":"Alcohol served in a mason jar, great country music, yummy Southern food, and a fun and lively atmosphere = a seriously fun time.  I love this place for the fact that it is so kicked back.  I can have a great time in my jeans and t-shirt.  Drinks are a serious business here since they are served in mason jars, so it doesn't take too many to get a quick buzz going.  Also, every time a Toby Keith song is played, everyone around the bar will get free shots.  (Yeah I know I am a lush, but hey)  The food is very tasty, with the fried macaroni balls being absolutely delicious and sinful.  If you are wanting to eat dinner here on a weekend though I would plan on arriving early.  I got there at 8pm on a Saturday night and didn't sit down to eat until nearly 9:30.  I don't really understand all the negative reviews, especially those that don't like country music.  I mean, why come here then?  But hey, I guess this is the beauty of Yelp, that everyone can review to their own tastes.  For me, this is one place that I will return to every visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"2 stars for the chicken strips and bomb blue cheese dressing and the drinks come is mason jars. We got the chicken fried steak and sampler. Food was bland and not really satisfying. Came here starving and leaving full, but disappointed."}
{"text":"Closed. Just a matter of time.  Serve crappy food and abuse your guests is not a good business model."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised that a \"themed\" restaurant really takes pride not just in selling merchandise but in making really good food as well! The service was great, we got the sample platter of pulled pork, sausage, ribs, wings and fried. EVERY bite made me smile! The bartenders and service were all happy and attentive. Thiago, our bartender was attentive, friendly and definitely took care of not just us but made connection with everyone he was servicing at the bar! The restaurant location is a bit hidden, but with the hunt!
We were also there on Monday for Cowboy Karaoke and I give big \"props\" to the team that put it on! They did a great job of making it a fun night. We bout another round of drinks to stick around for it and we're not disappointed."}
{"text":"Came to TK's only because I go to the one in Rancho Cucamonga, Ca and as you can see from that review. I really LOVE that place. However, I was super dissapointed when I came to Vegas 2 weeks ago--7/27/13. I didn't want to make a review without speaking to the manager on duty about the situation (hoping something would be done about it. It wasn't.)

My party of 3 came here on Saturday night around 10 o'clock to eat. We were promptly told our wait was going to be around 10-15 minutes. Around the 20 minutes wait mark we noticed some tables available yet we weren't seated. I went up to the hostess and she said that they were waiting for tables to be bussed and clean. I dont get it. I could see in plain view 2 tables available. an extra 5 minutes passed and we were finally seated. At this point I was just glad to be at a table and I quickly got over the prior hiccup. My cousin and I decided to order our drinks and food as soon as our waitress came by (2 waters and a lemonade. Nothing difficult. Plus 2 bbq salads. No brainer.) My other cousin had run to the bathroom and we told her she could put in the orders in right way. No need to wait.

Kelly, greeted us and took our order. 20 minutes passed and we didn't even get our drinks. This particular night at TK's was steady NOT busy. Not a moment after she took our order my other cousin reappeared and we told him our situation. He was quite surprised that we hadn't received our drinks yet (he works at a resturant and informed us that there shouldn't be any reason why it should take that long. 7 minutes at the very least to get our drinks and a total of 20 minutes to get our meals.) We finally got our order after 15 minutes. So, we waited 35 minutes total for 2 salads. :-/

At this point I was quite upset at the service that was given to us. I managed to track down one of the girls (our waitress was MIA) and asked her to send the manager to our table. The manager emerged from a back room which I could only assume was a banquent/party room. I told him our situation and he seemed to understand me or, so I thought. He told us he was going to get our waitress and NEVER came to our table to check up on us. Wow, the longer we stayed the more I hated being there. We didn't feel like we were taken care of at all. 

Kelly managed to shortly appear after we talked to the manager and told us that she had a mix up with a drink order with a larger party. It isn't difficult to take a drink order. You go around the table from person to person. She didn't apologize for the wait. Maybe because she assumed the problem wasn't her fault???!?! Nevertheless, we asked for our check so we wouldn't have to wait for it later. We honestly couldnt wait to get out of there to at which we decided to give our business to Gilley's at Treasure Island. 

SIDENOTE: We weren't expecting TK's to comp a meal if the manager and or Kelly took better care of us. We would have been fine paying for what we ordered. However, I won't be dining here next time I'm in town. 

-----

I do however give credit where credit is due and we were at TK's the night before this night and we had a good time, AT THE BAR. The boys were great and we got our drinks in a timely manner. It may not have been as steady as Saturday but even with the visits we had here prior I have always had a good time at the BAR. So, do yourselves a favor if you dine here. Sit at the bar and order from the bartenders! They seem like they know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"It is, what it is: a very commercial, country bar. Highlights were the fried bologna sandwich. Lowlights were: most everything else. In fairness: I had no business being here."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is seriously awesome if you like country music. Hot waitresses in crotchless and a$$less chaps (wearing skintight thick panties, not naked of course!), country hit music, great bbq, and American-proud decor as far as the eye can see. What's not to like? 

We had the sampler platter and meatloaf. My friend that got the meatloaf didn't like it (said it was dry and cold) but the sampler platters were great. Ribs, pulled pork sliders, wings, and sausage. A meatatarian (patent pending) dream, the American way. 

Midway through out meal a band came on stage ND started playing covers of hit country songs. To my surprise they were quite good! They even did a cool blend (I'm a real DJ so I don't call things \"mashups\" like pop society, and am kind of mad at Glee for starting the wrong use of this term) of margaritaville to sweet child of mine back to margaritaville again that actually worked well. 

We actually stayed about an hour longer than we planned because the music was good. 

The decor is outstanding. The entry doors are garage doors completely with garage door openers. Giant guitars overhead. America everywhere you look. The menu has lots of country references too. For instance the burgers come with a side order and one of the options is \"freedom fries\". Haha. 'Murica! 

No matter how cliché it is, I have to say it... I love this bar!"}
{"text":"Now yeah , Harrahs isn't the best casino on the strip but Toby's bar & grill is excellent ! One of the best places in all of Vegas hands down. If your there to drink they have girls give $1 shots from atop the bar. Or if your there for entertainment they have a great live band that sings Toby songs. And they even have a nice store built onto it for all things T.K. And of course the food ... They actually have drinks in a mason jars and the fried mac & cheese is the best ever !!!! A must hit place for anyone going to Vegas !!!!"}
{"text":"It's an expensive Red Robin for grown ups. The food was good, and the drink was massive. (It's not a normal mason jar. It's gigantic.) The band was fine, playing covers. It's not bad, but it's just not $60/person good either."}
{"text":"I really like hanging out here.  The chili burger is good and the Mac and cheese balls are great.  They have good TVs for the games but the volume is always Toby singing."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. We were here on a Sunday and were surprised at how empty it was. Service took forever on all aspects except bringing the check (that was super quick)!

Food was mediocre at best, for desert we ordered the warm brownie topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and warm fudge. Imagine our surprise when we got a cold brownie covered in cold fudge! Oh yeah and they forgot the ice cream!!! How does this get out of the kitchen?"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend William, he hug out here while in town for work. 
We got lucky and got a place at the Bar the bartender was cool, cute and on point with the drinks and had a cool spin the beer bottle, open-the-beer-flick-the-cap-and-side-kick-it -spin the opener back into the holster gig going on
neet!
the food was OK, Bill got the TK Nachos tri color chips with cheese and beans, peppers queso sour cream and guac looked pretty good.

I had the cowboy cheeseburger The bun was buttery and soft and had a fat wet spot from the pickles. It was not Med well and it was meh over all.

I do like that active duty military eat for free."}
{"text":"So...We came back.  This time, it was after a spring training game and I had my sister, her husband, and their 3 kids with me.  

Service was fine...place was actually pretty busy for a weekday.

My nephew and I enjoyed our meals...I had the fried bologna sandwich and he had the buffalo chicken sandwich.

However, my sister and her husband couldn't even eat theirs.  They ordered these MONSTER nachos.  I'm not kidding.  These things could feed 10 people.  So the other two kids ate off of them as well...or at least tried to.  I mean....who doesn't like nachos?

These nachos are served with 3 types of meat. Smoked chicken, bbq brisket and pulled pork.  Now the chicken was good...it was just a basic smoked chicken...no sauce.  But the pork and the brisket had sauce.  The absolute most sickeningly sweet sauce known to man.  So sweet, that it could have been called a dessert.  Needless to say, the nachos were not very edible.  

Thankfully, the server was kind enough to take the nachos off the bill...but from now on, I know not to order anything of the bbq sort here. I'll stick to the appetizers, bologna sandwich, and beer."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas,I always come here...food is good...servers are friendly..
Atmosphere is great to relax"}
{"text":"Why have American food when your in Vegas right? Well I was pretty surprise, I recommend the CFS than the steak..."}
{"text":"Hey Toby, I like this bar. I just don't love it. I do enjoy the live band who play a lot of rock in addition to country in their set. I like that. I also like the mason jar drinks here. Now if only they could work on their service a little..."}
{"text":"Went in for the ambiance, was surprised by the lack of service from Bartender Jay. 

We came in for a two for one beer special on Friday 1/16/2014 at 2:18pm and we asked for service for a friend who arrived late and were told...

\"hold on a second I just finished\" (in a very combative tone) 

IMO (in my opinion) as a service professional the correct form of greeting should be ...

\"sure thing, let me finish this up\" 

Considering there are many places to drink, I would suggest that the Toby staff be more service oriented. 

Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"We went on August 27th - we really should have gone somewhere else. Even Chili's has steaks that are more tender. You're really paying for the flavor, ambiance, and location; but we will never go again. The steak and the ribs were extremely tough and the salmon was overcooked. The waitress was nice and provided acceptable service, but I've received better at other restaurants.

In summary, you're better off going to Chili's."}
{"text":"I am only giving it two stars for the reason that I have yet to have a bad experience up until this Saturday. Me and a group of friends went here looking to dance and have a good time for our buddies bday. After about an hour of being there we were outside when a bouncer by the name of Jesse approached the bday boy and asked for his id.. We were confused at this because he said he was \"swaying\" we had been there for an hour no one was that intoxicated!! In no way were we making a scene. One of my girlfriends had approached them and asked what was wrong. Jesse the bouncer looked at her and said \"ITS BITCHES LIKE YOU THAT DONT LET ME FINISH\" that right there is what set me off. In no way shape or form should any man talk to a woman like that. The manager was called and he did nothing about the situation at this point we wanted to get out! I have gone to Toby's every thurs night and on the weekends I will never return to this establishment. Also I will make sure people know what Jesse said and how \"management\" handled it, disgusting!"}
{"text":"Stopped in once again for the mason jar mug of Blue Moon.  Waited about 10 minutes for a table. Not bad for a Saturday night.   Very nice atmosphere. Not loud but not quiet at all.  Seats are widely spaced apart so your not sharing food with your neighbor.  

Started with the fried mac and cheese balls.  $10 for 4 balls.  They were lightly beer battered and not too greasy.  Came quickly in about 7 minutes after ordering the app and our dinner. Absolutely delicious.  I almost wanted to cancel the dinner and order some more. Recommended. 

Next came dinner.  I got the pulled pork sandwich with fries. Good but not over the top.  I was in the mood for good so it worked for me. The waitress asked me if I was ok with the coleslaw.  I was , but glad she asked.   The coleslaw added a crisp bite to the chunky pork lathered in the slightly tangy sauce.  It was a nice medley to compliment the soft chewy bun. 

My girlfriend got the old West cheeseburger and she says 10/10.   The bun was buttery and soft and the party cooked to perfection. (Well done).  Not my choice of doneness but whatever works is what works.   We finished everything so that must mean we liked it.  


Overall. 9/10.  Beer was cold.  Food was delicious. And the environment was country.  Just what we like.   Baseball and football games all over the place on about 20 televisions."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night to hangout with friends. Must say that I enjoyed it! Had one of their  drinks in a mason jar, it was so worth paying for. Their shots are good amount for what you pay for. Big shots, they had a live band that night. What I enjoyed is being free to dance and not getting kicked out the floor if you don't know how. (Obviously I was trying to learn) overall nice staff & atmosphere. Will totally be going back!"}
{"text":"Firstly, everyone should know that Toby Keith has nothing to do with this location at Harrah's. He did sell his likeness to the group that does own this location. If you are looking for cheaper prices and a true Toby feel you should try the locations he does own in Oklahoma.

I was told it would be about a 10 minute wait and they have some tables and chairs to sit and have a drink or just hang out while you wait to be seated. 

I ordered the \"Fried Chicken Salad\" and it was fantastic. It is so huge you can eat off it for 5 days! The ranch dressing was thick and delicious.

I loved the country music playing and how other customers all sang along with the music together. When \"Red Solo Cup\" played everybody was singing and having a great time. They have many drink specials and for beer lovers they have special sizes just for you! With a players card I was able to get a discount off of my bill. If you want a good time this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"$42 for three vodka/tonics???  These were NOT in a mason jar, just a normal size.  What a ripoff.

There was an average (at best) band playing and an overcrowded dance area (that could have been made larger if they moved some tables).

There were tons of drunk people.  I mean really drunk, like people had to hold them up.  

I will not be back.  I really wanted to like the place but just wasn't feeling it."}
{"text":"The wings are really good! The service is good. Waitress was fast and friendly. Before we were seated I went to the bar and ordered a beer. I was given a warm beer. I asked the bartender for a cold beer. \"He said it's a country bar\" \"Warm beer is what you get at a country bar\". I've been to other country bars and was given cold beer. When we were seated I asked the waitress for a cold beer. She brought me a cold beer. When it's 109 degrees outside. I don't think a cold beer should be a question."}
{"text":"Can get pretty busy. Prices are decent, TR members save $1 or 2 per menu item.
We were told it was a 25 minute wait but I showed my Diamond card and was seated right away.  The service we had was really great- our server was clearly super happy to work there. Then there was another server who was wearing assless chaps. Luckily she had a nice butt, but kids don't need to see that so don't bring them here. There's a lot of good people watching here. Also, the small older Asian busser guy was REALLY great and deserves a raise.
Food was good- portions were pretty big. The torilla soup was yummy, as was the prime rib and twice baked potato."}
{"text":"\"I love this bar\"  
While waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, I had a $8 beer at the bar! Too bad i didn't make it last long enough.  Anyway, a live band came on, and the bull riding was free.  If I had enough for 3 more beers, I would've gone on that bull with no problem!

We ate the yummy food.  i had the bologna sandwich (recommended by the server) $12.  It wasn't that great, really.  I'm not into the miracle whip or cheese, or even the bologna (too thick).  I also had the \"who's your daddy\" margarita $18...YUMMMMMM!!!

All in all, I love the atmosphere of the live country music and the food was good."}
{"text":"All bad. The wait was ridiculous when they had plenty of open tables, the service was terrible the waitress only came to our table to take our order (once we asked her to take our order), and the food was not good for the price. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We went in the middle of the day and there was no wait...which was nice! The hostesses and waitresses wear ass-less chaps with some blinged out underwear. The drinks and beer are served in huge mason jars which is cool! The food was delicious! We got the chips and salsa, guacamole, and queso- delicious! The BBQ sandwich and fried catfish dinner was also very good! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The husband took me to the location at parkwest to celebrate mother's day, the Saturday before the actual holiday. We waited 5 minutes for the server to take our order. The place was empty. We couldn't figure out why everything took so long. We ordered drinks and by the time they got to us we ordered more just so they would be out in a timely manner. When our main course finally came around we had to retrieve hot sauce from another table, then wait for our server to come back because my husband didn't get the egg he ordered on his burger. We spent $108 between the two of us, and had to wrap it all up so we wouldn't miss the movie next door. All in all, food was descent, but service was definitely lacking."}
{"text":"I may bump this rating up a start down the road if I ever go in there and get above average service. I have yet to be in there and see a band perform...that would be cool! They have a HUGE bar which seems like it would be great at night and an in-house stage for a band to play. The food is good, a bit pricey, but you can always make this crap cheaper at home...you're out for a reason. I have yet to try the fried bologna sandwich. I just can't bring myself to spend $12-$14 on bologna, ya know? They do have a Kids eat free deal that goes on everyday that I have yet to take advantage of. Each kid eats free with the purchase of an adult entree. So one adult entree=one child eating free. That means if you have 2 kids and one adult...one of those kids better have brought their lunch money! ;)"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for lunch on weekday afternoon. If you park in the self parking structure and head towards the casino you'll pass by this place...so it's super convenient to get to. 

We were seated right away and we got the mac and cheese balls to begin with.  I've tried this at many places and have never been really impressed until I had them here. Delicious!!!  I ordered a Western burger, my friend got a fried bologna sandwich and my other friend got a steak sandwich (I think).

All three were really good. My burger was huge and I had to eat it in sections. For dessert we got fried twinkies. I've never had them before and I didn't really like them. The music, service and ambiance of this place was great. And of course no visit is complete unless you take a picture with the Toby Keith life size cut out in front!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, because I really love Toby Keith... but I didn't love anything about it. What words can I use to describe this place... awkward, skeevy, Denny's quality, ass-less chaps. I get that some people want a sexy girl to serve them, but when you're sitting at a table and one comes walking up, you're basically giving your order to their pants-less crotches. I also ordered one of those cocktails in a mason jar, and it was so damn sugary. Overall, I would be willing to try a different location, but I'll probably pass on going to this one again."}
{"text":"Went with an Adventure Buddy who knows her Southern Cooking! The Chicken Fried Steak and Fried Okra were excellent! Mac n Cheese too! We ordered with 'splitting' in mind and neither one of us could 'clean the plate' :) Portions are BEYOND GENEROUS! Atmosphere was fun, upbeat. Service was on point, pleasant, friendly and welcoming.  Good music, great value. A very memorable meal and delightful experience!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I visit this place EVERY time we come to Vegas.  Service is usually mediocre, but we're Toby fans and the food isn't terrible.  This time the food was better than normal and the service was great!  I had the ribs and shrimp combo, which was delicious and husband got the full rack of ribs.  Drinks are good and strong and the waitress is happy to give you a to-go cup when it's time to move on. YUM!  

We really come here to get a few bottles of the bbq sauce from the gift shop - mission accomplished!"}
{"text":"Toby Keith's came highly recommended by a friend's wife so when we did a guys trip to Vegas we stopped in for dinner.  We were staying in Treasure Island so it was basically across and up the street for a 10 minute walk to Harrah's (somewhere upstairs).  It was a Tuesday night and we had about a 15-20 minute wait to get seated so we hung out at the bar.  The first thing to catch the eyes were the waitresses (maybe it was the oufit with the cowboy hat, boots and shorts and/or the friendly personalities?).  The service was also pretty good though the dinner entrees took a while to get served.  The appetizers were decent enough - wings, nachos (w/grilled chicken, guacomole, sour cream, tomatoes, etc.) and shrimp hush puppies.  The disappointments were the dinner entrees.  Not one of the five of us were thrilled with the dinner entrees.  The flat iron steak was sort of tough and not very tasty, the rotisserie chicken was dry, the grilled ny steak was sort of bland, the meatloaf was also somewhat cold and bland and the beer battered shrimp was more batter than shrimp.  We were there too early for the band, but there was some kind of free shot thing at the bar that they did at least once while we were there, though one waitress mentioned that the shot of whatever was watered down.  Probably won't go back next time we are in Vegas, but might be worth trying out at least one time.  There's also a poker room in the back that we were told was only open on the weekends.  Oh, and did I mention the waitresses?"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food. \"If you've had one drink you aren't allowed in our establishment\" that's what a bouncer said. don't waste your time here unless you are sober"}
{"text":"If you like eating in a mall food court that has more security gaurds and employees then customers this is your place. Will never dump money in this dump. Go to your local hangout instead!"}
{"text":"CALLING ALL WHISKEY GIRLS AND AMERICAN GUYS

You're going to have to be a fan of country music to enjoy yourself here. A large screen playing music videos and some smaller ones all around with both tunes and NASCAR, will be the background noise to your dining experieince.  Loves it!  I first saw one of these places while driving through Nashville and have been wanting to eat here ever since!

The girls working are in chaps and the eye candy was excellent! Our server was Rhonda and she did a fantastic job. Totally on top of it and delivered great service through the whole meal. I ordered a house salad ($11.99) and when it arrived I could tell it would feed me another meal or two, so I asked for a to-go container before dressing it. She brought me one (which I filled with salad) and even brought me a lid for the extra dressing. They must get this a lot! The two cups of dressing were huge!

My husband had some sort of big club sandwich that he enjoyed ($15.99). We both had a drink and enjoyed the large mason jars - you don't have to check on a table as often because it takes longer to empty a drink (not sure why some places use such small glasses). With our check, Rhonda brought to-go cups as well and made sure our glasses were full.  When you're paying $3.50 for each glass this makes you feel a little better about it.  That's expensive beveraging!! Service was superior to most places of similar value. And it wasn't just her, we saw lots of hard-working employees and bussers. Everyone doing their job well and providing a pleasant dining atmosphere. 

Sign up for a player's card! Your Total Rewards card from Flamingo works in the Harrah's Hotel where this Grill is. We didn't realize this and so we missed out on a couple of dollars savings from each meal. Bummer! They must be sister hotels - wish I'd known that it worked at more than one! It was too late by the time we figured this out.

($37.81 for lunch)"}
{"text":"Good: The food was great! But that's about the only thing. 

Bad: We went out for lunch for my grandpa's birthday. I signed him up for the VIP club so he could get a free steak dinner. They told me I was supposed to print out the email to show them but the email just said to bring it in so I thought it would be acceptable to just bring the email in on my phone. They still took it but gave me a hard time about it.  The food was over priced. I ordered chicken strips and it was $13 for 4 strips and some fries. They were good but not $13 good. The service sucked but all the girls were new because they had only been open a few days so I just brushed that off. You can tell they definitely hire based more off looks that experience. The wait for the food was extremely long, at least 45 minutes. For the amount of waitresses they have running around, you would think it wouldn't take so long for us to be waited on but that wasn't the case. The waitress took FOREVER to get the check out to us and we had to tell a manager that we were looking for her but she was no where to be found. About 10 minutes later, she finally brought it to us. They need to step up their game."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place with zero stars I would.  

I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews. This place is a dump.  

To begin with, I tried to call the restaurant several times during the week after noon and no one answered.  Finally, they answered.  I just wanted to see if there were any happy hour specials. Geez...

I met up with some girls to start up the evening for a bachelorette party on a Saturday evening.  Not everyone showed up at the same time, so the hostess would not seat us until the entire party was there. (We had 10 girls in our party.)  They also have a sign that says that there is a 90 minute maximum at your table.  Oh yea....they don't take reservations either.  Not to mention 2 of the hostesses were rude and I had to pull answers out of them.  Already not having a great experience, because there is NO level of customer service in this place.  

The drinks are expensive....$7 for a corona light.  Yes, it's the strip but at Harrah's that seems a bit crazy.  Maybe I should have splurged for the $22 mason jar, but I was the DD and didn't want to get crazy.  Every so often, they blow a whistle or something and someone jumps on the bar to pour some shots into your mouth.  

Once we sat down, I asked the server if my sister and I could split our bill out.  She made sure to tell us they only split checks a max of 3 ways.  OK what is with this place...can't I catch a break?!  All in all...she ended up splitting the check 4 ways....funny how that worked out.  

The service was OK and the food was not so great.  Typical strip food....over priced and under delivered.  We only had bar type food...nacho plates, club sandwich and I shared an app platter. The best thing was the fried mac n cheese balls. Not super great but good.

Later that evening about 3 hours after I ate....I had food poisening. Yes, like Linda Blaire!  I am sure it was the chicken wings.  I will be contacting Harrah's and the health department.  I didn't drink so it wasn't that.

All in all...not a place I would EVER go back to."}
{"text":"Last day in Vegas and stopped bye. Great idea! John the bartender was fun and made us girls laugh! The drinks are good and the food... Delicious! Will definitely come back when I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this...

I hate country music.

But on the other hand, the food is AMAZING!

It's overpriced.

But the food is AMAZING!

They have a good gift shop too.  Which is also overpriced haha but AT LEAST THE FOOD IS GOOD!"}
{"text":"Was surprised by this place. Not a huge selection, but food and price was better than the Applebee's quality I expected."}
{"text":"Been to the Vegas location several times over the past few years and come to realize a few things.

The Food.
Typical bar food, good variety and the kitchen was fairly quick in getting me my order. I've done the cheeseburger, club and wings, all of which were fine. No Food Channel awards, but it was satisfying and the portions were decent.

The Service
Table service is a pain point for this place. Every time I've visited, it seems they were shorthand on wait staff. Be prepared to wait if you go there and want table service. I now go to the bar when I visit. The service I've received from the Bartenders is excellent, be it for food or drinks.

The Atmosphere.
Good layout, lots of TVs and seating. Audio on sporting events is muted in favor of country music. This was kinda annoying, being it was hockey and basketball playoff season. I then came to grips, realizing this place has Toby's name on the door and country music is king here.

I'll go back if I stay at Harrahs, as its really convenient and you can usually grab a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"The bar is 4/5
The food 3/5

The bar is fun and the atmosphere is good. Even if you don't like country, who wouldn't want to drink out of a mason jar?

The food is just okay. Nothing special. I would go back to drink, but would not go back to eat."}
{"text":"Cover charge for guys, took our high top and chairs after hours once the band started while we were sitting there, bouncer made us remove ourselves from the area where we were standing to make room for a \"high profile client\" who did not even grace us with their presence. Not going here again. 

Nice eye candy for single guys, but nothing here for us married guys who are looking to grab a drink after the game."}
{"text":"Came here after I got a groupon for $25 for $50 worth of food and drinks. My experience was above average for sure, nice live band playing while me and my girlfriend were there. Wasn't crazy packed either so our food got to us pretty quick. I had the triple decker club sandwhich (I can handle my own but I must say it was huge!) and my girlfriend ordered the nachos (once again it was a lot of food)  as many other reviewers said you had to have it. The food was great, customer service was good, my beer was nice and cold, and the waitress's walk around with chaps on and just underwear underneath; so you not only get good food but something nice to look at as well. Overall the experience was great, the food was to our liking, the entertainment was a plus and we will def head back with friends."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Good food, great live music, ambiance is kickin! Service is not shabby either. Get the nachos!!! OMG $11.99 with a rewards card and they fill 3 people."}
{"text":"When reading this review please note the song titles in the brackets.

So if you've followed me here on Yelp, you will have noticed that I have been to Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo and Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville. Today, January 20, 2017 I let my wife decide when we went for lunch. It was time our little lunch adventures had [A Woman's Touch].She decided we should go to this one place inside Harrah's casino. Now, we don't exactly live in the [Trailerhood] but we traveled from Northwest Las Vegas, down to the Strip and finally placed a check mark here. When we got to Harrah's it felt like we have to walk [Upstairs Downtown] and all around the casino, but we made it. When we got there, I thought to myself, \"That's  The Next Thing On [My List].

So when we walked in, I didn't see a  [Humingbird] I didn't even hear a staff member say [Who's That Man?] Guess I am not that famous yet. But I did notice the female staff wearing chaps and bikini-like shorts. No, I didn't say [Who's You Daddy?] but I did wonder if this place would be appropriate for children.

We were seated immediately. We looked around talking about the décor and all the television screens, my wife never had a chance to say [I Wanna Talk About Me.] Instead our waitress came by asking us what we would like to drink. My wife is not a [Whisky Girl] instead she ordered an iced tea. I ordered a soda. Our drinks were not served in a [Red Solo Cup] but instead they were served in large mason jars, which I liked.

When reading the menu, it's pretty basic. You won't need a degree from [Honkytonk U] to understand it. It's basically barbecue, hamburgers and that sort of thing.  My wife ordered what was called [American Soldier] Burger
100% all-beef grilled burger topped with your choice of cheddar, swiss, american or pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion. The wife chose American cheese. 

I did not order [Beer For My Horses] and I had no need to [Get Drunk And Be Somebody.] What I did order was \"Old West\" Burger
100% all-beef grilled burger topped with cheddar cheese and crisp bacon then smothered in Toby's barbecue sauce topped with beer-battered onion rings.  This is my kind of hamburger, it almost had me [Dream Walkin'] After eating this hamburger I wanted to say [I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying.] But instead I told my wife I liked my hamburger, I asked how she liked her's and she said, [Me Too].

The French fries we were served were my favorite part. When you go here, make sure you [Getcha Some].  Maybe I [Should've Been A Cowboy] but alas I am a father with two daughters, and I think my daughters would like this place for lunch. But, [It's A Little Too Late], due to the outfits worn, and the restaurant not having a kid's menu, that fifth star, well... [He Ain't Worth Missing.]

As I finish this review, the food here is better than the previously mentioned places. The price, is good for tourists. But I must ask one question...

[How Do You Like Me Now?]"}
{"text":"We came here for drinks for a friend's birthday. First thing that seemed weird is that the bouncer checked my wife's purse and had me lift my shirt and do a 360 so he could see my entire waistband. I have never had that happen anywhere, ever. Not even the airport! Now at sporting events I can see checking the purse, but showing my waist seemed a bit odd. We get in and there's a cover charge for men only, which is kind of sexist if you ask me, but whatever.  The girl taking the cover has a few electronic devices with her so I tried to giver her my credit card, but she only takes cash. There's an ATM right there so be prepared to pay the $3.25 fee for cash if you didn't bring any. So I give her a 20 and she slowly breaks my change down into ones and fives. I didn't ask for that, but fine. Then I notice she has a tip bucket. Really! A tip bucket for taking cover charges. You didn't even provide me a service, why tip there? I assume that's why she gave me ones, so I could tip. I did not. So we find a table and after a while end up going to the bar to get our own drinks because a waitress was not to be found. Eventually someone did come by though. I missed her the first time but it was the last. I was never asked by staff if I wanted another drink, the entire night we were running to the bar and back ourselves. The first bartender we talked to was not very friendly and seemed annoyed to take our order. My wife ordered one of the frozen margarita drinks they had in the rotating machines. She tasted it and it had a distinct soapy taste. We had others try it and they agreed. It's like they didn't rinse the machine out enough when washing it. She sent the drink back which was something we've never done, but thankfully the second bartender was nice about it and made her a new drink. I could tell the security guys were aggressive, they look like they watch a lot of UFC if you know what I mean. They came to our table at one point and made us all show our wristbands again. We're adults, not hoodlums trying to sneak in. But ultimately they didn't bother us. They also had an attendant in the men's room, again with a tip bucket, which is fine but he has to hand you the paper towels. He was selling chew cans in there too. So I have three suggestions for this place: 1: don't treat your customers like criminals before they even get in the door. 2: hire attentive, upbeat staff who are happy to serve and earn a living. 3: don't expect tips immediately when you walk in the door. And bonus suggestion is to do a better job cleaning out the margarita machine!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Friday around 6pm. We didn't have to wait to be seated even though it looked quite busy. Our service was excellent. We ordered an the smokehouse nacho(with pork) appetizer. It came out quickly and they were some of the best nachos I've ever had. My burger and wife's pulled pork sandwich also came out quickly and both tastes perfect. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing. Chicken wings are the size of your fist EACH wing! Definitely worth the price, large portions. And drinks are delicious served in red solo cups or mason jars. Decor is very cute through out the restaurant"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 7 I'm not a fan or or do I care about Toby Keith or country or whatever, I just wanted good food, good service and good drinks! I got 1 of them. The drinks were fantastic, the speed in which we got them not so much. Service was slow, terrible & pretty much non-existent. Haley, our server was doing the best she could, she clearly was hand-cuffed by shitty management and kitchen staff. When we had a complaint about our dish, she apologized and then told us the cooks just laughed, but didn't offer to fix or remake or change the order. I know a party of 7 is usually a pain in the ass, but there were literally 4 other tables in the restaurant and this place is HUGE! And we were 1 of 4 tables"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for drinks and to hang out for a bit.  The joint is tucked away on the 2nd floor of Harrah's in the back near the entrance to the Monorail.  It's too small to be a club.....about 1/2 the size of Gilley's.  

The food here is OK bar food.  Our friends ordered some Wings and I sampled a few....they weren't bad, just OK.  Same goes for the Fries.  Since I didn't pay, I didn't catch the price.

The waitresses are supposed to be cute/hot....but only 1/2 of them were.  The others looked a little \"sloppy\".  I hate saying that, but if you're going to put your staff in sexy outfits, I'd make sure they are able to meet high standards....especially in Vegas.

Overall, the food/experience was just OK.  The best part is the music.  The joint feels very 'touristy'.  I'd give it another chance under the right circumstances.

Return Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"Let me say this first;  the food is ok, typical bar food.  The prices are a little high but it is Vegas you have to expect that.  Now let me say this;  We went there two times during our most recent trip to Vegas, and both times we ran into problems with the staff.  The first trip we were a party of four.  There were several empty tables but we were told it was a 20 minute wait.  I said \"really?  But there are many empty tables\": to which the hostess replied quite nastily: \"that's right\" and then walked away without taking our name for the list.  As we were ready to walk out she came back, took our names and 15 minutes later we were seated.  We waited 10 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 for her to take our dinner order.  The food was ok, not great not bad.  Now, three days later I went down to get a bowl a soup because I was not feeling well.  I was seated right away, but again waited 10 minutes for a waitress; let me say there were only two other people in the restaurant.  The big problem with Mr. Keith's restaurant is he need to hire nicer, more professional, and more efficient staff.  Do try the chicken and dumpling soup though;  it was very Grandma's home made soup."}
{"text":"Hard to find... waaaay in the back of Harrah's Casino on the SECOND FLOOR. Music was good. One of the bartenders is really talented and flips bottles and does tricks."}
{"text":"This is a pretty low key theme bar. I am not a country fan, but after having dinner and spending some time in here enjoying the band, I am now a fan. Maybe it was the alcochol helping, but the place is fun, and the food is actually decent. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"The bartenders here were terrific. Nice guys that were quick to pour drinks, no waiting. They were there every time before I had finished the drink I had.
The atmosphere is great, the music is great. I hadn't tried the food, but definitely will on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Went to Toby Keith's last night after a year. The first time was for my best friends birthday party and our experience was not the greatest. Drinks were spilt on our friends by the servers, no one was attentive, and it wasn't a good experience in general. Came back last night for the first time in a long time and still wasn't impressed. The food was delicious, however. It wasn't busy at all around 8pm that we were there. Our server failed to check on us when we needed something. Looked for her everywhere when we were ready for our bill while she was just standing up front."}
{"text":"When you come to vegas.... you hope to see a few things... 1) Large portion of food 2) Hot girls 3) Celebrities...this place has all 3!

Large Portions: The food is amazing! Its not a buffet, but everything on the menu is made texas style... BIG! Toby Keith must be a hungry man cause there's no way you can leave that place and NOT be extra full w/ leftovers!

Hot girls: the waitresses... super hot here! In addition to that, they are super nice, fast, and attentive. They don't pressure you to upsale you and very familiar with the menu items. I asked them questions about the steak and they were able to answer it!

Celebrities: Eventhough Toby wasn't there... There's live music there! You feel like you're in a special concert with a meal. There was a cover band that was there that did a really good job playing some country music. 

Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This bar has a weird vibe. The staff always  seems mad about something. The bar tenders are slow and the bouncers walk the bar with an aggressive attitude. People go to country bars to dance, drink, and have fun, not to be intimidated by doormen and bouncers. My advice to TK's is drop the tough guy attitude. Step up your customer service and play more country music. I like all genres of music, but metal at a country bar makes it hard to dance with a girl. 

Also unlike the song there IS a cover charge :("}
{"text":"I ate at Toby's in January 2015 with a group of co-workers and we all enjoyed our experience.

Toby's is located on the second floor the Harrah's hotel.  Next door to the restaurant is the Toby Keith's gift shop.

It has a great cowboy/country decor, and the staff are all very friendly.  The waitress all wear very skimpy attire.

The menu selection is large, with a good variety of food.

I ordered the Fajitas.  I thought the portion size was small based on the cost.  The chicken did taste very good.  The rice and beans came in a little plastic cup and the portion was extremely small.  The drinks come in mason jars and cost around $20 each (no you don't get to keep the glass).  a little pricey.

It's a loud environment, and gets very loud when the band starts playing.  There is a dance floor and a lot of people were up dancing.

This is a great restaurant to drink and listen to great music, but I think the food takes a back seat to the live entertainment and bar.

Despite that I had a great time, and look forward to returning here again."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience ever here went hear for my wife birth day and the service was really bad never had refills on drinks and also found a bug in my food would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Very accommodating servers - our server felicia was AMAZING.  she went out of her way to make sure everything was PERFECT.  


Huge waters in a mason jar - and great beers, country music, and super fun atmosphere.  this is a very typical american tex/mex type place with beers and fatty food.  i had a great time!!! 

the reason for the 3 stars was the lack of vegan options. COME ON TOBY - vegans like tex/mex too - maybe some quick fixes would be taking the pork out of the black beans, having the rice be vegan (no chicken stock/butter) and then just offering a tofu option with the fajita."}
{"text":"Ok food- not bad but not great. Service was slow. There were many empty seats and yet they said the wait time was 20 minutes, so we sat at the bar. We ate our dinner at the bar. We wanted dessert but since the food took almost a half hour to come out, we asked the bartender for a Pecan Pie to go while we were eating so that we wouldn't miss the show. We get the bill and the bartender tacked on a \"to go\" charge for the Pecan Pie. Now, don't get me wrong- I'm from NY and used to charges like plate sharing etc where usually the waiter informs us that we should order something small instead of being charged the $5 or $6 sharing fee. But we sat and ate our dinner and now you are charging
me a \"to go\" fee that is half the cost of the food item I ordered. Hmm. Just doesn't make sense. If I order the pie and then just asked for a box, it wouldn't have been more...so why not just suggest that? I asked the bartender about the fee and he said he couldn't take it off because we asked for it \"to go\" even though we sat there. It wasn't the fee that bothered me so much, it was the principle. And just like you are there to make money, I'm there to spend money- but not on a restaurant that charges me to put my pie in a box after I ate at their establishment. I'm a former waiter and restaurant manager btw- so things like this tick me off."}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times and it's always the same. Basic bar type food ( think Friday's or Applebee's) with country music playing. Our friends can't seem to get enough, but for me it's a tourist trap. One and done if you never have been here but otherwise avoid. Don't get the mason jar mixed drinks unless a 20 dollar Pepsi with a splash of alcohol is your thing."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check this place out...mainly because of me and my love for the musician....DONT GO.  The greeter was RUDE...because we came in the wrong door.  The table was dirty...as were the seats.  Our server was very sweet.  She did her best to make sure our experience was a good one.  That is where it ended. My husband had the BBQ chicken...dry...bland.  I had the BBQ chicken wrap.  Tasteless.  I ordered a Bloody Mary...horrible...and the $4 frozen margarita...which tasted like well water.  It really is a shame that the food and drinks taste so awful....The concept is a good one...like the music....but the rest....lets just say McDonalds would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the meals at ILTB since it opened. Their soup is outstanding, baked chicken is perfection, tenders are awesome, Whiskey Girl Wrap, yummy, great fries, great sweet tea, fried pickles, yummy, Good portions, the staff is wonderful and if you're lucky you may even get to see Toby! Drinks are good size, most served in mason jars. Real down home southern hospitality. When the Tony Marques band is playing, you hit a grand slam! Great food, Fun times!!"}
{"text":"This is a bar and restaurant. Bar food, what can you say. Nothing exceptional, nothing to brag about. If you are partying, then this is good food if you are in the neighborhood. 

Service was great. Staff very friendly. They want you to have a good time, and we did. Definitely good for country music fans."}
{"text":"The food was delicious ! Fun atmosphere , cute outfits, great service ! The drinks were served in freaking giant mason jars and the bourbon was not a weak pour!!! Man was that a great farewell Vegas moving / husbands birthday dinner !! I can't say that I would go back unless prompted or special occasion but it was definitely a fun experience !!"}
{"text":"This place had a cover charge for UFC Fight.  Didn't appreciate that and the server was not paying much attention to us.  Several at our table didn't like their food.  And then we err kicked out of our table because the band was about to start."}
{"text":"Let Vegas bring HonkyTonk Town to YOU. 3 STARS, EXTRA STAR GOES TO JESSICA C.

[ATMOSPHERE] : 
20 Burgers && Sandwiches to choose from 
+ People square dancing on the dance floor
+ Country music filling up the atmosphere
+ Band on stage
+ Dim tasteful bar feel with some lighting (just incase beer goggle's not enough *nudge nudge*)
.. minus mechanical bull *sad face*

Chicks in chaps && boy shorts? Don't worry boys, you won't be needing beer goggles in that department ;]

On top of that they had a free Burger && Beer deal for troops the time I was there. Showing their love && support for troops, huge burgers && drinking straight out of jars: nothing screams American Pride more than that. 

[SERVICE] :
Jessica's the BEST. My entire table pretty much all ordered the free meal deal and 2 appetizers. I can understand what an annoyance it can be to have 2 handfuls of troops come in and ask for the free burger && beer deal. Poor thing had to carry out 10 plates && 10 beers knowing that the tab's only going to be $25 at most (for the 2 appetizers). Given the scenario, I honestly didn't expect her to come by and check up on us, but she did. And she was so attentive despite what 20% of $25 is (don't worry, she got waaay more than 20% of the tab).

I'd give this place 5 stars if they didn't charge so much for mediocre food. $14 for an OK tasting burger? Cmon now. I can slap together the same burger @ home for $12.50 cheaper!"}
{"text":"Good food terrible service. One of our guests didn't even get her entree. We didn't get an app we ordered. Waited almost half an hour for the check. No manager checked on us. Just awful service and no apology, explanation or even a free appetizer. No customer should ever have to sit there while everyone else eats without food."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Bouncers are weird. Play the same music over and over. Came here to celebrate my brothers Bday. Our waitress was okay. Guys go around picking up empty bottles and cups, and sometimes pick up your filled cups and bottles... Wth? Not impressed with this place."}
{"text":"I love this bar!!! No seriously I do! The bartenders are amazing!  Jimmy is Da Bomb!!! They do bar flair which is nice.  Drinks are strong, food is good. If you're a service member you get a free burger.  Thanks Toby!"}
{"text":"I'm not reviewing the food, only my experience at the bar.

Service was good, drinks were made quickly. They ran out of seagrams whisky, however, which is always a bummer. I ordered a vodka cranberry instead, which was extremely bitter. One was enough for me.

The band that was playing was FANTASTIC. Seriously, theyw ere amazing. They play not only country, but a lot of rock, and even surprised us with their rendition of \"ice ice baby\"!

I would go back for the band. And possibly the drinks, if I'm not paying for them myself again."}
{"text":"Well, my first impression on this place was TOTALLY off. We drove up and could smell the bbq. We were seated and our waitress came over to take the drink order.  We also gave her an appetizer order (We ordered the TK Platter, a little bit of everything).

The drinks arrived -- mine was blehhh weak and my husband's, which was only supposed to have had just a bit of creme de menthe, tasted ONLY of creme de menthe.

Five minutes later, she came back to take our food order.  We ordered a full rack of babybacks to share, with sides of mac n'chz and baked beans. 

The appetizer came out within 5 min. after we ordered our food.  We still had no plates or silverware, and all the sauces for the appetizers were missing.  We asked for sauces, napkins, plates and silverware and the waitress kept coming back, forgetting one or two things. 

We finally got all the items we had requested and our MEAL arrived!!!  We hadn't even had time to eat the appetizer!  The appetizer was okay, not great.  The wings were large, but they were dry, with hardly any sauce on them.  The nachos just had cheese -- no pulled pork, chicken or beef, just plain cheese (I could have gotten that at Taco Bell!).  The fried pickles were so overfried that they had \"opened.\"  The mozzarella sticks were tasteless, even with the marinara -- however, the jalapeno poppers were fabulous!

The mac n'chz was totally mediocre, but the beans were delicious.  Although the ribs were tender on the inside, they were completely overcooked on the outside, and the top and bottom were stringy and impossible to eat.  To top it off, the BBQ sauce that was served with the ribs was COLD!  Really?!

We were mostly ignored throughout the experience.  The waitress was thoroughly stressed out, cute as she was, but cute doesn't get tips from me. The appetizer platter (which was large) stayed on our table (a 2-top, no less!) throughout the meal, even though trash and bones had piled up on it.  Servers and bussers worked around us and never once stopped to see if they could take some of the plates off our table. I was amazed at the tunnel vision of these employees.

Our server finally took our plates, but did not offer to bring the check.  We waited another 15 minutes until finally my husband ASKED for the check.  In that 15 minutes, she passed our table at least 10 times.

Oh, and while we were eating, one of the waitresses kept coming to the table beside ours to talk to the man who was seated there, and to hold the baby that was at the table.  After seeing her every few minutes or so, I realized it was HER bf/hubby and the baby was HERS!  She spent so much time at this table and I kept thinking to myself -- if she were serving me, I would be thoroughly p.o.'d that she wasn't taking care of her customers!  I guess I'm a little old fashioned.

That amazing smell when we drove up?  Must have been \"piped out.\"  To say I was unimpressed is putting it mildly,  We won't return.  End of rant."}
{"text":"MY friends really wanted to go, and we've been going to the places I wanted to go, so I had to compromise and go.

We had to wait about 10 minutes, finally when we got seated, we were placed right by the damn stage, which is where the loud speakers are at, and where the house band plays at.  It was so damn loud we couldn't even have a conversation, we were hungry, quiet and waiting for the waitress to bring us our waters.

We all ordered different things, and when we got them, the food was \"ok\" and they weren't even hot,  just warm.  Finally the service was slow.

I would come back to this place, but I will never eat here.   Maybe a night of drinnkkin at the bar singing bad country songs. (since they mostly play the new poppy crap)."}
{"text":"Nice bar, but food is horrible, all four of us walked out of there regretting the overpriced bland bar food, should have gone to hash house instead"}
{"text":"We wanted to eat at Toby Keith's place at Harras for quite a while but never had a chance, we finally found time to go and we must say we've been very satisfied of our choice.

The place is nice and good for couples, families and groups... definitely not for business or romance as the place is noisy in general and every evening you have live country music which is a nice plus (the group was pretty good as well and offered a nice selection of songs). If you like to dance, you can enjoy yourself right under the stage even if you don't have a partner.

Food was good and I definitely enjoyed my ribs, although a little bit too much on the sweet side for my tastes (I prefer them to be heavily smoked). Conisidering the kind of place I'd have liked a wider choice of draft beers.

The place is a little bit pricey for what it offers, but it's Vegas so it's expected."}
{"text":"We went last night for the free line dancing instruction. 11 of us, all seniors. The drinks were fine, appetizer's so, so. Service was good. However the instructor was late. 2 girls got up on the stage to teach us the steps. The music was loud and the mike didn't work,, so we couldn't understand what they were saying. They showed us a few steps, then took a break. 45 minutes later the instructor showed up and immediately told us after a break we'd get started. She again showed a  few steps, then turned on the music and expected us to be able to do the dance. She was rude and more into herself than into helping any of us. We did one dance, then it was break time again. The instructor had the music going and was out dancing with the people who knew al the steps. When she wasn't dancing  with the crowd, she would wonder off. We learned with the help of 2 very nice young ladies and a young man, who took the time to work with us. We finally just gave up, paid our checks and left. I asked our waitress if this instructor was paid or was a volunteer, and was told she is well paid. She doesn't teach, but is paid. Someone is really getting ripped off. This restaurant is huge, but on a Tuesday night had very few customers. Can't see how they will stay in business. We won't go back and won't recommend it. Additionally, never having been there, we weren't sure how popular this was and when we called to see if we needed to make a reservation we were told only if we had 14 people and we would have to spend $300.00."}
{"text":"I hear nothing but good things about the food and today is my 2nd time at a Toby Keith's, but wow, these prices are deadly! No lunch specials to boot! I guess it's full-price all day, every day! Food has been great  on both visits but not sure it's worth the price."}
{"text":"Last time I came to this restaurant about 2 or 3 years ago I had a great time. I enjoyed the food and the drinks. So now that I am back in Vegas with friends I decided to bring them here and this is one of the most disappointing trips to a restaurant that I have had in a while. 
The service was slow. Our waitress barely checked in on us. The menu has a small variety of options. The quality of food is not worth the price. I ordered a \"she's a hottie\" chicken wrap and it was SO disappointing. It was so bland. It was supposed to have the chicken dipped in hotwing sauce but it tasted so bland. I was upset. The fries have no flavor to them. 
The only plus to this place is the live entertainment. That's it. I will not be coming back to this restaurant again. 

P.S if you want a side of ranch it's $1.00... Stupid economy."}
{"text":"On my friends bday this past June, we roamed the Las Vegas strip (in the 100+ degree weather) looking for a fun casual place to celebrate. After walking into a few very expensive bars, I suggested Toby Keith's I love this bar and grill not only because I love Toby Keith BUT i also LOVE country music! 

Once we walked in, I knew it was going to be great night! They were playing dance music during the intermission of a live country band! Their drinks were in mason jars, and the beer was only $8 served in a HUGE mason jar! I ordered a round of drinks and our bartender was extremely friendly When I ordered my 2nd round of shots, I engaged in a coversation with mr.bartender who asked what we were doing in vegas all the way from HI. I told him about my friends bday and he did this fun red yellow green 7 shot pour and gave it to us for free! Then he asked me if I wanted to try! Of course I shouted HELL YESS! Most fun ever! 

Pro: 
Great customer service
Inexpensive drinks
Great music (live and dj)
Clean

Con:
bathroom is located outside of the bar (right next door)"}

{"text":"\"\" Good Food,Great Atmosphere,Great Drinks ! \"\"


On a recent visit to Las Vegas, my wife and I visited Toby Keith's Restaurant, and again it was very good. The drinks and variety of beers is very good. Every time we go to the restaurant we try something new, like the delicious chicken spicy wings, or the Fried Bologna sandwich, or the Fried Twinkies for dessert.. This visit we tried the Meat Loaf with Gravy, Baked Beans and a Baked Potato with Bacon. It was Awesome, it made me feel like I was back home ! My wife had the Country Fried Chicken Steak with Gravy, with saluted vegetables and mashed potatoes, which she said was also very yummy ! They always have great music playing in the restaurant and have live entertainment at times. They also have a wide variety of Toby Kieth memorabilia to see and enjoy also. Give it try on your next visit to Las Vegas, and bring your \"Red Solo Cup\".

{"text":"They carry Tito's vodka, so my Texas friends are happy!! The band was really good and the DJ filled in while the band was on breaks. Very entertaining!  We didn't eat here so I can't tell you about the food, but the drinking and dancing is good!"}
{"text":"For those of you going on nights that there is entertainment, there's a cover charge.  Shrug.

I am very conflicted but ultimately not going to go back.  I went on my birthday with a friend.  I got a free steak dinner and he got a sandwich.  I ordered the ribeye steak Medium Rare.  After 25 minutes, we both got our food. There wasn't many people there for lunch at the time.  They apologized for it being late but not much of an explanation.  My steak was cooked Medium well, almost well.  LIterally a faint pink in the middle and grey for the rest.  I told the waitress and she agreed and took it back. About 2 minutes later a lady puts the steak back on the table and says, sir you said this is overcooked? This is medium rare.  I explained, it is not, medium rare should be red, pink, grey, not this, it's almost well done.  She was like, no it's medium rare.  I was like no it's not, it's like almost well done.  Then she was like, so you want me to undercook you one? I'm like sure if that's what it takes.  She then said, it will take another 8-12 minutes.  Which is appropriate, interesting she can tell me how long it takes to cook a steak and rest it but not what the temp is.  The second steak was rare.  Undercooked but better than overcooked so I ate it. The rudeness of the manager, I assume, is the reason I would never go again."}
{"text":"This place had potential.  The atmosphere and music are pretty good.  Unfortunately the bouncers are a bunch of absolute tool bags.  My cousin got approached at a table and asked to show his id.  He had shown it at the front door.   He was then asked to step outside so they could check and see if he was intoxicated!  First, he wasn't.  (1 beer). Second he was minding his own business.  The bar was sparsely packed.  We were talking amongst our own group.  The only thing I can think of is they didn't like his shoes.  (Nikes). Or...they are prejudice.  A fat bouncer with a beard approached him and started harassing him out of the blue.  They said he could re-enter when it became clear he was not intoxicated and he would most likely sue if they continued to harass him.  He is a business professional.  We ended up leaving  for the night but will not spend our money in a place with douch bags for bouncers!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment!!!  Although there were over 25 waitresses, the service was subpar. They all congregated together in groups and gossiped. They all walked around like they were better than everyone else. Pork chops were overcooked and the mashed potatoes were dry. The management overstaffed the restaurant in hopes that the eye candy will bring customers."}
{"text":"I've eaten here in a couple of occasions. I wouldn't even consider coming here if it weren't for my family. My brothers are huge country music fans and they had to come eat here. I was surprised by how much I liked the food. It was really good. I figured they go off the name and skate on the rest. I was wrong about this. The first time I was here I had the fried bologna sandwich  I liked it. I was expecting a bunch of regular thin deli Bologna but it was a thick slice grilled to perfection. I know we ordered an appetizer I think it was the wings or it came with wings the second time. I remember wings for sure. They were good but I'm not a big wing guy so they were passable but didn't wow me. I had a burger and it was good, but I expected it to be after our previous trip. Service is fine nothing to write home about. Sometimes it can be a little slow on the refills. The location in Harrah's is up stairs I the back. Way in the back. It's a bit of a haul if you're on the strip. But not bad. If you're driving to this part of he strip self park at Harrah's and you'll walk right by on you're way in. Overall a good choice when you're in Harrah's."}
{"text":"If there was a no star rating I would have selected it! Worst experience ever! At 10pm they take the bar stools and make you move away from the bar so the \"girls\" can do a dance on the bar. The crowd didn't seem to be impressed at all...I think I herd two people clap when they were done. The guys taking the chairs were pretty rude about it. Won't be returning...EVER!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and atmosphere last Friday night, Toby Keith protrays this All American image, we bought some beer koozies from his store next to the resturant with the stars and stripes logo and looked at the tag and there made in MEXICO!  WTF!  Won't spend another dime in his resturants or buy his music!"}
{"text":"Went for a concert, which was amazing. The  crazy expensive and totally disgusting cold food was unbelievable. There were not nearly enough tables for the kitchen to have a problem putting out hot food and the quality was shameful. I could find better selections at Costco."}
{"text":"Fuck this Bar & Grill!  I don't  know how many times I walked by this place w/o  thinking WTF? Who names their bar Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill?!?!?!? What douche bag  you are Toby!   Had one beer there and walked out the door. Too Expensive even for Vegas!"}
{"text":"Was there last September. Atmosphere and service was dead lame. Toby Keith's I Love Me Bar and Grill....."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Sunday evening and it wasn't that bust at all. We immediately got seated and it was just the wife and I. We sat there for 10-15 minutes and not one server came and introduced themselves or acknowledged us. Needless to say we left and found somewhere else to eat. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"The food was good and the drinks were a little expensive.  The manager melissa was rude she wouldnt let us change from our to small table to a larger one. She wouldnt accomadate us at all and we spend over &60."}
{"text":"Great environment and lots of eye candy for men.  However, that has it's pluses and minuses.  They will try to nickle and dime any man that walks through their door.  They only have drink specials for women, and men need to pay cover charge and full price beers on Thursdays, while women have free cover charge, and pay only 50 cent beers.  Either make a friend, bring a friend, or curse out the restaurant for being sexist and taking 5 steps back toward gender equality.  That said, the atmosphere allows for a very relaxing time, and it's perfect for a beer after work.  If you have a few bucks, some time, and want air conditioning, it's a good place to go.  That said, there's tons of waitresses, and I swear that 9 out of 10 of them are under 21 and thus can't serve alcohol.  This leads to one poor workhorse serving 40 customers.  The service becomes slow and bogged down, and your throat dry.  The food is nothing to rave home about, but there's a few unique items that'll please foodies, but nothing special.

It's decent and has tons of potential, but as of now, Toby Keith's is middling somewhere and can't figure out how to elevate it to the next level."}
{"text":"I know this place is for tourist, but as a local this is one of my favorite places to go.  I don't know how great it is for a bar, we usually just go for lunch and the place never seems too busy.  I like that it's just off the parking garage so we don't have to push and shove our way through a crowded smoky casino to get there.  

The first time we went I ordered a steak, but what they don't tell you on the menu is that it comes smothered in mushrooms.  I'm deathly allergic and had to send it back to have it re-done.  It would have been nice to know ahead of time.  However, the waitress let me keep my sides so at least I got to eat some of my meal with my party.  

My favorite thing on the menu is the mac and cheese, and my husband has a sweet tooth for the deep fried twinkies.  I've ordered something different every time I've gone and other than the death steak it has all been really good.  When they have been busy, we have even recieved a free appetizer.

I've read some people bitching that they got a plastic cup instead of the advertised mason jar.  Big deal, the place sells the mason jars and they do get busy.  God forbid they sell drinks faster than the dishwasher can do dishes.  Over all this is a fun place to eat that has good food and fair service, but I would not recomend it if you hate country music."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Ate at Gordon Ramsey's the night before. This blows that away. Love good pub comfort food. Outstanding service, cold beer and incredible food."}
{"text":"In honor of an upcoming trip to Vegas, I thought I'd review some of my most and least favorite places in the town. This place tops the \"least favorite\" list by a long shot.

Hey, maybe I'm just not the crowd this place is looking for. I thought I would be, because I'm a HUGE country music fan, and even admit to a grudging appreciation of/liking for Toby Keith's music. Which is good, because you can't look around the bar without seeing a zillion pictures of the guy. So if you disagree with his right-wing views and occasionally racist song lyrics, this probably isn't the place for you.

HOWEVER, if you like paying $8 for an aluminum bottle of Bud Light, this is definitely the place for you. I'd question your intelligence, because cheaper (or free) beer is readily available in Las Vegas, but hey. If you like artery-hardening fried food that claims to be \"Southern\" by virtue of its being fried, this is definitely the place for you.** And most importantly, if you like your meal to be interrupted at random intervals by ear-piercing whistles, music volume suddenly cranked to 11, and sadly unattractive (and fully clothed, but maybe that's a relief) male bartenders dancing and cavorting on the bar, well then, this is DEFINITELY the place for you. Have at it.

**Grudgingly, I have to admit that the fried mac and cheese was pretty tasty, if I recall correctly."}
{"text":"Not my favorite dining experience while I was in Vegas!  The food was marginal at best and way over priced for what you get.  I had the bbq chicken sandwich & still to this morning I am still trying to figure out where my bbq sauce was on this chicken.  Chicken was very fatty & the fries sucked.  I do have to say the very large mason jars filled with tea was the only best thing about my experience. I don't think the effort to find this place which wasn't easy & the prices will keep me from coming back.  If you are a Toby Keith fan and love seeing his pictures everywhere you turn then this place is for you.  Very loud and very non friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Lame, the food is too spicy or too greasy to eat.  I got the sampler platter and it was just fried food, I did not like any of it, I had to go home and eat something worth eating that was fried, this place did not cut it.

I like mixed drinks this place did not really have anything for me, this place
is probably good for beer, but who knows because I don't drink beer.   

We did get seated fast but the food is not worth going for even though the waitress was nice and friendly, food doesn't add up."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick bite to eat at the hotel, and since there weren't too many options, we came by here. Large and lively, waitresses dressed in chaps, you got a sense of the Southwest feel here.

Huge mason jars of water or soda, I saw a table nearby with nachos. I had asked the waiter if it was a half or full order, and he said half. It was HUGE! And it was only $8! I was set on that, and a friend also ordered their fried mac and cheese balls. Was excited to try it!

The fried mac and cheese ball was dissapointing. Flavorless, even with their spicy ranch sauce.

When our entrees came out, they were HUGE! No one could finish their food! My nachos were really good, was quite surprised, and we could barely put a dent in it. Their french fries, although could be cooked a little longer, were really tasty as well.

All in all, a good cheap meal, and we left just as the live band started rocking out. A p plus is using your Total Rewards card for a discount as well."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the MidWest so this place reminds me of home...cowboy hats, mason jars, country music, the electric slide...as far as a country bar goes...you really can't ask for much more! 

I haven't actually been the bar in probably 3 years...they have added stripper poles with \"dancers\".  Very pretty girls but a little random.  People are eating dinner and there's this half naked girl dancing to some country song!  Probably not the best place to take small children for dinner!

We went there because my husband's best friend had Navy friends in town.  They said they liked the food...didn't see what they had.  
Service is okay...They were busy and don't have very many people working at the bar.  You're going to have to wait to get a drink if it's at all busy in there.  Drink prices are pretty typical for a Strip eatery/bar.

My favorite thing about going here is you have choices in a close proximity.  Carnival court, casino gambling, etc. are all pretty close in walking distance."}
{"text":"The service as well as the manager in this establishment are terrible..waited over and hour for our food and watched 4 other tables who ordered after us get there food first yet the waitress blamed the time on the kitchen staff..the manager was not helpful at  all was very ignorant wouldn't come back to this place if it was offering free food"}
{"text":"I never eat here or anything so I can't say anything about their food, but when it comes to drinks this is the place to be!! As Vegas local it's hard to find a strong drinks sometimes in the strip! The bartenders usually don't pour to well, and drinks are expensive as hell!! But Toby Keith's bartender make them drinks so strong!!! And we always come for the live band! It's a local country band but also there are not a lot of country band here in Vegas; so we always have TONS OF FUN!!! I love this country bar, keep it up Toby!!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. If I could give this zero stars I would. The only good thing about this restaurant is your seated right away. Service is bad & corn Tortillas were hard as a rock. I asked for a refill of my water - and in 2 hrs never got it. It was a big grp so I feel that the waitress was slacking because she knew she was getting an 18%tip. We were paying cash and the remainder on the card and the waitress didn't know how to do that--she put it all on the card and gave us back the cash. Managers was no help either. Never ever ever going to this restaurant again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here.  Band was awesome.  Service was good. Food was tasty! 
But there's a catch...............YOU HAVE TO LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC!"}
{"text":"I know, I usually have rave reviews of everything but this food was not good. 
The only thing good about the service was her lack of clothes. She forgot several things. 
I will have to say that the portions were huge, I thought the price was high, but wow, massive portions. Also, the food looked awesome. Had the food tastes as good as it looked this would be an amazing place. If you're looking for a place on the strip to eat, pass this place over.
I've edited this review twice. It's at one star now because after eating there four hours ago I am writhing with pain in my gut and feeling very ill. I know this is vegas and there's booze everywhere but I am not a drinker. Do not hear here."}
{"text":"Will never be going back.  Service was horrible.  On a Tuesday evening, when the place had barely anyone in it, we were told there was a time limit on the tables.  Wanted to stay to watch the band, so we went over to the bar.  Impossible to get any help at the bar, and then when we did, they looked at us like we were idiots for asking about drink specials. 
The appetizers we got were good, but it's too bad the service made it a place I will never go back to."}
{"text":"This place is a chill, laidback sort of bar and it's great to visit in the late afternoon (around 5 or 6 ish).  We took our friend there for her bachelorette party and all ended up having a really fun (and funny) time.  The guys at the bar were happy to show her a good time during her bachelorette party and funny things definitely happened.  It's a chill atmosphere and other bar-goers join in on the fun too.  The drinks were pretty good and were quick.  When we went the bar was not too crowded but still pretty fun.  I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First when we arrived there was a wait for 10/15 mins but there was a bunch of tables open. I have ate at the same restaurant in Cincinnati and the food was great but they were out of Twinkies for fried Twinkies. But this time I had chicken fingers that were undercooked and raw I wasn't able to finish them all and the fried pickles were hard as rock like they had been battered and placed in the frier for a second. I do not like to return food after getting it due to movies like waiting ;) so I just left it.The bartender was great she was really nice and very helpful but that's about all the good I can say."}
{"text":"The food is OK but the smoke in the bar and restaurant is excessive. It was much more fun in the past to go to this bar when Jimmy was working there. Jimmy was such a good bartender and a outgoing person, it made up for the OK food and the smoky environment. But with Jimmy gone, I'm not sure that I will be going back."}
{"text":"Located inside Harrah's Casino. 

We stopped in for a few drinks and a bite of food. 

Ordered the chicken tenders and fried mac and cheese and they were both decent, but I had ordered the mac and cheese last year at the pool and thought it was supposed to come with a cheese sauce, and it didn't, it came with a ranch sauce instead, no biggie. 

Got a house whiskey and club soda, which was like $11.25 (ridiculous) and a Blue Moon for like $8. 

Drank my whole beer and found my orange still had the little paper on the outside, which is pretty gross. 

Decent live music and crowd but there are plenty of better places in Vegas to spend your time. Super overpriced, even for Vegas."}
{"text":"Love Toby and good country music and lots of booze but this place just didn't do it for me. The only reason im not giving 1 star is because if your a guy there's a lot of very attractive waitresses in leather bras with bikini bottoms and ass-less chaps. The drink here were very weak and very over priced even for Vegas. The food although it was good it took forever to get to the table and all we ordered was appetizers. The band that was playing was pretty good but when they weren't playing the dj was playing nothing but hip hop and techno which killed the mood. I though the dj would actually play country and a bar owned by a country legend."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a snack and drink while strolling through the hotel.  We decided to go with the fried pickles and they were delicious.  Because we didn't enjoy a full meal, the five stars are based on the atmosphere, the great service we received, and the creative items on the menu...not the typical items you would find in bar and grill.  I'd love to return and try some of the other eye-catching menu items...perhaps the fried Twinkie for dessert...mmmm"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best evenings I've had in a long time. The atmosphere was amazing, live music and great decor. Not a place to sit and have a quiet talk... but when in Vegas you aren't here for that anyways. The lay out was perfect. Space for dancing and not overly crowded with tables, great band and dance area. Our server is what made it over the top amazing. 
We had Jessica and her personality is one of those who you want to be friends with but stayed on top of her tables flawlessly and never was far if you needed her. Food and drinks were impeccably delicious. And the whole staff was great. I'll be back just because our server alone!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We walked in were told to sit anywhere. After sitting at the bar for five minutes and no service we walked out past the hostess and server who were chatting to find a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me say first that the meatloaf I had was very good. The 2 stars rating is because the waiter dropped my margarita on the table splashing this sticky stuff all over my hair, shirt,face and pants. Not once did he apologise for HIS mistake.  When he brought another one I asked him \" if the first drink was on me then the 2nd one should be on him \"  He chuckled at me and left. I think his mind or his eyes were certainly on something other than doing his job. He asked us the same questions over again. Then chuckle again when we told him he already asked us that question. At the end of the night I paid the full $24 for my drink.
Not impressed."}
{"text":"We stayed at Harrah's and saw that the Toby Keith bar was in our hotel. After checking in that evening we put our bags away and headed down to the bar to get a late dinner. We were very excited to be in Vegas and were looking forward to our week stay there. That evening my husband and i split a meal. We were not very hungry and wanted to call it a early night since we had worked that day.
The next morning my husband had diarrhea and was not feeling well. We decided to go down to the pool anyways and see if he would feel better. When I got into the pool my stomach started cramping. We decided to go back up to the room since my husband started to get sick and we were not even drinking at all. For 16 hours straight, I had diarrhea and was throwing up at the same time. We both were sick and had to share the bathroom. Plus there was no fan.This was the worst I have ever felt. I could keep nothing down and had constant diarrhea. My husband did start feeling better after a few days but I was sick the entire time. At that point we knew we had food poisoning. We split a burger and both ended up sick the first night there, that kind of speaks for itself. 
We did do a incident report and let the hotel and business know. The manager told me I had probably been out in the sun and was not used to the heat. Funny how we didn't even get to really see the sun since we got sick the next day. I just think they could have done something to make it right. I am writing this review so others who are thinking about eating there don't make the same mistake we did. I would not want someone else to spend all that money on flights, time off and the room and have their stay ruined by getting food poisoning. They would do nothing to accommodate us. I have told everyone to stay away from that place. I don't know if it was the meat or someone not washing their hands. Who knows, what I do know is their customer service in dealing with the situation stunk. I will never, ever in my life go there again. I am glad there are sites out there so I can warn others."}
{"text":"I was not happy with my experience at Toby Keith's. The service was terrible. They seemed to be under staffed and our waitress was not very friendly or attentive to our needs. The food was ok, but not something I would rave about. I don't think I would go back there again."}
{"text":"Honky Tonk fun!!

Think this was one of the highlights of my Vegas trip...really awesome atmosphere and the bartenders were really friendly....namely Charlie and Ruben

One thing I have to say is I'd rather eat at the bar than at the actual restaurant...when we went it was rather busy, but the servers were a bit abysmal in the service....the thing that elevated this place was the bar....they took better care of us than the actual servers...( think that was why we removed ourselves from the table and plopped ourselves at the bar lol)

Drinks were made well.....and I think I have a new favorite drink.....Sweet Tea Vodka and Lemonade.....yummy!!!

Oh I also got their deep fried bologna sammich!! =) (I love bologna btw)

Anyhoo...I'll try not to sound too much a lush....just go to this place already!!!"}
{"text":"Our large party decided to try this place out because we were staying in the hotel and it was close.  We ended up be pleasantly surprised.  Our server was a delight and we all thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We had active duty military members with us and they were treated to a free meal.  We'll be back for sure.  Thanks Toby Keith's for continuing to support our armed forces."}
{"text":"Do you like good service? Avoid this place. I am sad to have had my last meal in Vegas at this poor excuse of a restaurant. The hostess was polite and great but our waitress took our order and never came back. We'd try to wave her down and although she wasn't busy and was cheerfully serving other customers, she made faces the 3 different times we interacted. We asked for drinks, she practically rolled her eyes when we told her we wanted water. She came back to take our order and the bus boys and runners took care of everything else. We waited forever to get our tab and when we asked for it she practically rolled her eyes AGAIN. Did we not fit the profile of people she normally likes to serve? Aside from our horrible waitress, the food was bland and extremely disappointing. The ribs and meatloaf were both so bad we ate less than half and DID NOT take leftovers. Even if we had wanted to, my mother felt shame asking for a to go box to avoid further interactions with the waitress. God bless the bus boy and hostess who redeemed this restaurant even a bit. I expected much better after having stayed 5 nights at Harrah's."}
{"text":"I like this bar because it has plenty of room and you don't feel like you are on top of everyone like out in scottsdale or tempe. It is still far away from my house, but I do find myself coming here on occasion. The live music is decent and they always seem to play music that gets me dancing.

I haven't had dinner here yet, so this review is specifically for going as a bar. I am not sure if if the food is any good."}
{"text":"Decent but not great band. Came in late for a drink and had to wait 15 minutes at the bar for service."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. And outrageously overpriced.

We waited 20 minutes for water that never arrived. We had to go up to the bar to order all of our food and drinks because there was no actual server in our section. (The guy we asked for water just said yes to appease us; he was a bartender.) No server in 1/3 of the restaurant for Sunday night Football??

3 bartenders working and I still stood and waited 12 minutes to order a drink. $10.50 for a house bloody mary?! It was served in a very small plastic cup (not even a red Solo cup!) and the mix came from the gun!

As I waited, I watched the bartenders screw up two orders (gave group A's food to group B and vice versa)... and then proceed to swap everything out after about 2 minutes! Unsanitary! And NO APOLOGY!

The 3 bartenders, all male, had ZERO personalities and attentiveness. One was just a downright asshole...to me, to my friends, to patrons at the bar.

I even left a long note and my phone number on my credit card slip...and no one had the balls to call me to discuss their atrocious service. They must not care.

The one star is for the band...they were decent.

Advice: skip Toby Keith's I Hate This Bar. Way too many great places to go on the Strip."}
{"text":"We got winners, we got losers
Chain smokers and boozers
And we got yuppies, we got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars
But I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just trollin' around the dance floor
Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge, come as you are -Toby Keith Lyrics


I'm in love with this place. This was my 1st time and I can not wait to come back and try the steak entree. 

I ordered the meatloaf and was more than over joyed with the abundance of flavor and how tender and fresh the entire meal was! It came with your choice of one side, fresh vegies, corn bread, and rolls :) 
They offerer a lighter side menu, which includes a turkey burger that looked to die for,  and came with the most amazing french fries!!! 

The service was the sad part of this experience, the waiter was neglecting our table to say the least. He had a few larger parties he was dealing with at the same time and focused on them a lot. I will not knock a star down because of this one waiter in there restaurant because the rest of the waiters looked on point and were nothing but friendly. 
There is a large bar area, and some room for dancing, large screen tvs for country music videos and plenty of pictures of Toby Keith :) There is also a gift shop located right next door that has a bunch of cleaver take home gifts and reasonable prices. 
What are you waiting for all you country fans, and food junkies..go go go!"}
{"text":"What a fun place this is! My wife told me about this bar and how great an atmosphere it had. This is exactly what you would expect from a bar created by Toby Keith (except for the racist, right wing beliefs). The male to female ratio was definitely split 50/50 leaving plenty of fish for the single males and females. I think my favorite part about this place are the massive mason jar drinks. You only need two or three to get a solid buzz going on. And let me give you a fair warning for you timid types. If it's someones birthday they will be in for a surprise if they don't know what to expect. First a bar tender will stand up and blow a whistle violently then present a drink with whip cream in the shape of a penis or a vagina for the appropriate sex. They will then hold it down by their groin while you chug the whole thing. I have seen multiple people get scared and embarrassed but hey guess what? it's VEGAS! So chug away! the bartenders are the showman type throwing bottles behind their backs and making a hell of a show out of your order. Last note, whenever the Toby Keith song \"I love this bar\" comes on make sure you are near the bar because they will graciously throw out free shots straight from the bottle."}
{"text":"The environment is fun! The food is okay. The drinks are overpriced and don't taste the best. The waitress knew a ton about the menu from others taste pallets but never tried anything it seemed like. Which was about all she seemed to know. Our order was wrong several times when it arrived. Perhaps going back will be better once they are more established."}
{"text":"I was in search of a convenient late late and stumbled upon this country and western music theme restaurant. Let's give it a go! 

The menu here is burgers and more burgers and is trying hard to make a  memorable impression: drinks served in novelty red plastic cowboy boots (definitely my kinda place! Joke!) Oddly, the water is served in Mason jars. Since that's retro chic I was surprised, as there's nothing chic about this place. Some burgers come stabbed with a steak knife to hold them together.  

Another surprise was the hostess lady - she walks around in cowboy chaps which isn't that big a deal, but she only wore a pair of modest black knickers underneath, like a bikini bottom. You can't help but stare! This was probably the oddest addition to this potentially wholesome restaurant - a cheeky bit of Vegas twist I guess. Another bit of the entertainment is the music videos playing on the screens. All country music and probably lots of Toby Keith stuff.

My turkey burger with advocado was ok. It bet it would've tasted better with the fries. I got the potato salad which did seem homemade and not from a plastic box, but who knows what's real in Vegas! :) My waitress said the burger came with fruit, but I didn't see any in my basket. I paid around $15 for the pleasure of this ok/average burger."}
{"text":"This is the second bachelor party I've been to in Las Vegas and both times we've hit Toby Keith.  Both times it has been the highlite of our trip.  The drinks are stiff and the country music is loud!  Great live bands and awesome staff.  Mason jar drinks and a dance floor.  Yee-hawww!"}
{"text":"My date said the turkey sandwich with avocados was delicious.  I ordered the ribs with chicken wings.  The chicken wings looked very unappetizing with the re-cooked yellowish color to it.  The ribs were too sweet.  

The server was very personable and had great social skills.  I appreciated  the service, but I wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing to jump for joy over. It's just bar food just like any other place but they were a little expensive. I actually like Toby Keith a lot. What did surprise me is the gift shop next door. Almost all of the items were made either in China, Mexico and other countries. There were a couple of shirts that said made in the usa. 

So much for 'Made in the USA'"}
{"text":"So, a great place in Vegas. Know where you are going before you go. This is typical Vegas strip food. Nice southern American food.  Great service. Our server didn't miss a beat! Special drinks were good. I had the fish and chips. Nice fresh fish. Done well, not too greasy at all. Wife had the shrimp po' boy. She loved it, with fried green tomatoes. She had the whisky girl and just the perfect amount of sweetness and alcohol. I had The Patriot and loved it. Nice amount of Jim Beam. We had the fried ouch lea for an appetizer. Long spears and fried well. The ranch dip is mild but refreshing. Also, nice to listen to congruent classics in the background. Again, great food in the Harrah's. And a good gift shop attached"}
{"text":"We had really good service and good food here. You actually get a lot of food for what you pay for. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and it was really good and loaded with bacon and the fries are really good too. I would come back here again for sure."}
{"text":"First visit to one of Toby's restaurants. 

Took longer than expected to be seated given our early afternoon arrival and all the empty seats. However, the service was good once we were seated.

The food was good and there were large portions."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's family seems to love this place, but I just can't seem to get on board with the tacky atomosphere and mediocre food. Guess music videos of guys in cowboy hats and girls with too much peroxide in their hair just isn't my idea of fun background music. 

Being a non-red meat eater doesn't leave me with many choices on this menu, so I've ordered a quesadilla both times I've been here. I love food with a Mexican flare, but it's just not very memorable here. The service is fine, and they serve beverages in large jars (which is nice), but being located in Vegas does this place a disservice because I just imagine eating elsewhere due to the many options on Vegas. This place is pretty meh."}
{"text":"Okay first off this review is only for the Superbowl party,  not the normal operations of this bar.  I go to Las Vegas at least twice year, and I go to Toby Keith's every time we are down in Vegas and we never had a bad time there.  Always has good live music playing during the night, even got to see Toby Keith sing one time.

This was the third time we have gone to Toby Keith's for their Superbowl party.  Got in line to get time at around 10am like last year.  Doors opened at noon.  First noticed that they didnt arrange the tables into long rows like they did in the past, but whatever a lot of places leave their restaurant area tables alone during special events.  We took a table in the of the restaurant area because there were five of us in the group.  The screen that we had seemed smaller that what was there last year but that could have been just due to how much further away to it we were.  The buffet was the same as years past, decent nothing to write home about.
Now the reason I am writing this review.  The service was ... hmm, I cannot come up with the best word to describe how bad it was.  As part of the package you get 4 bottles of either Coors Light or Miller Light.   I would have drank way more than that in the coarse of the 6 and half hours we were there.   Between the time we sat down to half-time (about 4 hours) I had 4 beers.  I ordered a beer every time our waitress came by.   Yes I am saying in 4 hours we got checked on 4 times.  This whole time I am watching the tables around us get checked on by their waitresses multiple times and even asked a few to help us for absent waitress.   
A little way into the third quarter our waitress returns to us to tell us that she needs to close out as its the end of her shift.  Okay fine.  Lets hope the next one will check on us more.... not really sure there was ever was anyone else assigned to our table because it wasn't till the fourth quarter I finally complained to a \"manager\" about the lack of service.  He said he would take care of this.  Sweet, a new waitress showed up took our next round.... And we didnt see her again.  So at this point Toby Keith's will not be seeing us next year as we will be at a different Casino's Superbowl party."}
{"text":"Trying to save money in Vegas saw a groupon  for this place and decided to check it out. It is further inside Harrahs and on the second floor. Our party of 3 was seated quickly but took a while for us to get drinks and have our order taken. The drinks come in large mason jars which justifies the price they charge. Sampled their appetizers of quesadillas, chicken strips and whisky girl wings with bread pudding for dessert. A fan of the strips and wings and the bread pudding was tasty but too sweet with the sauce and whipped cream. The wings were huge and had just enough of sauce and heat. The breading on the strips made the dish and the chicken was nice and moist. Will return here for more appies in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an appetizer before goin out~ had brisket nachos and a side salad. Nachos were huge!!! Two of us shared and there was still enough left over for two more people!!! Brisket was shredded and layered into the nachos which is nice cuz as u eat u get a lil bit in between instead of the brisket just being put on top~ side salad was good too. Lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes and cheese~perfect"}
{"text":"Great Fun Place. The Bands are Always good, and if your lucky, Toby Keith, when in town, will jump on stage and play. A terrific treat.

{"text":"Went to TK love this bar for date night with my hubs.  What a fun place! Country music and booze! Yay!! Let's not forget the food. Yummy burgers and nachos the size of Texas! There is plenty of seating and a nice size dance floor.  When the house band isn't playing there is a big screen playing music videos.  This is a fun place to hang as a couple or with a whole group of friends. The bartenders are friendly and make a good strong drink;)"}
{"text":"Great place! The food is really good and the portions are huge! The waitresses are super friendly as well as the rest of the staff. They have a store right next to the restaurant that has some cute stuff. Love the huge screen playing great music & videos as well."}
{"text":"What is there to love about Toby Keith's Bar & Grill? Not a whole lot.

My family and I had dinner at TK's last night as an alternative to Guy Fieri's who 1. Doesn't take reservations and 2. Wanted us to wait 2 hours to eat. Ha ha! No thanks Guy. And BTW - no reservations? Come on.

First TK's has a fun atmosphere, but looks like a normal 'ol bar and grill. The walls are decorated with Toby Keith... things, and all the girls wear panties and chaps. Ass in your face every time your server leaves your table. Speaking of service, it could be improved. After we were seated we waited a good 10 minutes to put our order in, luckily, since we all had sufficient time we all knew what we wanted to eat and drink.

Onward to the food - steak fajitas, which came out sizzling and made me excited. But when were placed in front of me were a let down. The beef was haphazardly cut and chunky, not strips. Plus the meat was not seasoned in anyway and it looked just WRONG to me. Fajitas come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. I picked corn - half of them were not steamed enough and had hard edges. They brought them out in a tortilla holder with NO LID. What the heck? No wonder it did not steam all the way. Dear manager of TK's: put lids on your tortilla holders and customers will get tortillas that are soft! My fajitas also came with: rice (OK), refried beans (OK), salsa (not spicy at all), guac (OK), and sour scream (OK). Overall what could be a great dish, only mediocre.

Next - \"I Love This Bar\" BBQ Sandwich - my mother requested no sides for her sandwich, but they brought her fries anyway. She said the BBQ sandwhich could use more BBQ sauce. 

Chicken Fried Steak - My brother had this and said it was so-so, not a REAL chicken fried steak in my family's opinion because it didn't appear to be pan-fried, which is the honest way to make a chicken fried steak - not deep frying it with a lot of breading. Speaking of breading...

My husband's fish and chips were mostly breading which he peeled off so he could actually eat the fish.

Lastly, the shrimp appetizer which my father ordered for his meal came with a HUGE amount of deep fried little shrimp. There had to have been 20 and it came with a tasty, creamy cajun-flavored dipping sauce. I really liked the shrimp.

Overall - I feel as though there could be a lot of improvement. I like Toby Keith. I like the idea of the restaurant - I really like all the country music they were playing, but the food was a huge downer."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time over the weekend with a group of friends.  We tried to put in a reservation for that night but was told reservations have to be made a day in advance.  WTF!?!?!  Anyways, the food was ok.  Wife tried the Burger, I had the Country Fried Steak......nothing special there.  Plain old American diner food served up at twice the price.  Their drinks though are pretty good.  32oz jars for $18 bucks a pop isn't a bad deal considering you're getting two drinks in one.  After one Whiskey Girl, the wife was trying to be first line when they offered free shots at the bar.

The cover band was actually pretty good on a Saturday night, the only negative was once we started enjoying ourselves after dinner listening to the band next to the dance floor we were told we had to give up our table.  By that time the place was standing room only so we didn't bother sticking around."}
{"text":"Came back to try some of the food that I enjoyed the first time around a few years ago. Nope, not the same. At least the quality didn't seem like the same as list time. 

We tried the Fried Pickles (too much batter, the pickle itself was pretty good though), Biscuits and Gravy with Chicken and the Bronco Burger.

The wife said the biscuits and gravy was pretty good, but the oil that the chicken was fried in made it taste just like the pickles which didn't leave a good after taste.

Bronco burger is like a kitchen sink of burgers. Pulled pork, Bacon, Onion Ring + the normal fixings of a burger. It was good, nothing super special but it was a solid burger. The meat itself was very well done which was a bummer, but I ain't gonna complain about that. I must say that they need to change the oil or something because my fries tasted just like my wifes chicken and the fried pickles.

Overall, I'd probably pass next time. Even though it is located inside one of my favorite hotels to stay at on the strip."}
{"text":"My 2 favorite things about this place are the Buffalo Cheese sticks, and the mason jar alcoholic drinks. The cheese sticks are made with jack and bleu cheese, and I believe when they are breaded, they are dipped in buffalo sauce. They come with either ranch or bleu cheese dressing, and they are a great twist to the traditional mozzarella sticks. 
The mason jars are on the expensive side, avg. $19, but they are big and last a while. They have good burgers, and yummy crispy steak fries, and almost every meal is a little over-sized.  
My biggest gripe is the service, all of the hostess' and waitress' are women, and many of them are snotty. First off, they are walking around with chaps and their asses hanging out, that might be one of the reasons for their uptight attitude, and they can be very rude. The most recent time my husband and I came here with my in-laws, our waitress was horrible. She never cracked a smile, rammed into my purse almost knocking it down (it was hanging on my chair and she didn't apologize or even look back), and she forgot my mother-in-law's drink because, \"oh, uh, someone just handed me back there check and I haven't had a chance to pick up your drink from the bar.\" Have someone else run it for you half wit! She's lucky my father-in-law paid, because I would not have left her sour-puss face 1 red cent. Don't like your job? Your ass is cold? Find another one, don't take it out on the customers tipping you=common sense.
If I didn't like those cheese sticks so much, I'd probably never come back. I'll most likely sit at the bar from now on, because the bartender's are usually a little nicer then the last 2 waitress we've had the displeasure of having."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I decided to visit Toby Keith's I Love This bar & Grill for dinner.  We got in without reservations with only a minimal wait at 6:00 on a weeknight in July.  It was a little tricky to find as it was upstairs and around a corner inside of a casino (Harrah's Las Vegas), but after wandering around for a while we finally figured it out.  

The decor is very cutesy country, fitting since the bar's namesake, Toby Keith, is a famous country singer.  The atmosphere alone is worth part of the cost of the meal.  We pushed together a couple of tables and ordered a few drinks.  Now, I should probably warn you, as I WISH someone had warned me, that their drinks are HUGE and come in large mason jars.  Even the adult beverages come in these same jars, and they don't make them weak an watered down, either.  You'll be feeling your liquor by the end of your first one, and I had more than one.  I was drinking one of their signature cocktails called The Patriot. The Patriot consists of Jim Beam Kentucky Bourbon, Southern Comfort, dry vermouth, and sour mix with just a splash of sierra mist on top.   Let me tell you, they go down smooth.  I had a sip of my friend's Georgia Peach (vodka, peach schnapps, and sierra mist, and it wasn't too shabby either.

When it came time to order the entree I decided to go with the BBQ'D rotisserie chicken as it looked like one of the healthiest items on the menu.  For about $18 I got a half chicken slow cooked on a rotisserie to a tender and moist perfection and brushed with a generous helping of barbecue sauce.  It came with a choice of two sides; I chose mixed vegetables and a baked potato.  I asked them to put just cheese and bacon on the potato and put the butter and sour cream on the side. Everything was tasty and while I felt stuffed by the end of the meal, at least I didn't feel like I'd clogged my arteries with grease.  One of my friends even mentioned how tasty my plate looked.

I'd definitely come back again the next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.  A bit loud but good. 6 of us for dinner on a Wednesday.  Steak was good, cooked perfectly. Mixed veggies delicious.  Fries also good. Two had a BBQ chicken salad.  They said it was very good as well. Waitress was ok, seemed a bit overwhelmed even though they were not busy."}
{"text":"**2.5 stars**

Came here for a quick bite to eat before shopping and its in the same hotel we were at (Harrahs). If you have a total rewards card, there are special prices for each menu item and I believe it takes $1 off each item which is great. We just wanted something quick so we ordered the bbq wings and fried pickles. The bbq wings were delicious, they were big wings and smothered in bbq with some extra on the bottom. For $12 though, it was pricey for 8 wings but hey, when in Vegas! The fried pickles were decent but nothing too special. The other items on the menu didn't look too bad but definitely overpriced for most items like ribs and fries even with a discount. 

The customer service was good but she was a bit slow. We waited at the table for 5-7 minutes just to be acknowledged by someone and get some water that tasted like tiolet. Then we had to wave her down to get napkins and later on for the check since she never came to our table. It was not very pleasing to the eye when the girls are a little bit bigger and they are wearing booty shorts that show half their butts. Just saying. Besides that, the food was decent. I'm not a country music fan, but I knew and heard of Toby Keith before. It was funny seeing him everywhere with pictures of himself posing on the walls and basically a shrine to myself throughout the place. Theres also a gift shop next door, probably overpriced also but I didn't get a chance to go in. 

I would say skip this place unless you're only getting the wings!!!"}
{"text":"Been here 6 times, but am not a stranger to the area since I live in it. The place is nice, prices expensive for what you get, and service is poor. 4 of the 6 times I received the wrong order, takes forever to get service at the bar, and tons of staff just standing around while you wait.

Want a better experience and better happy hour, head over to Saddle  Ranch at Westgate... way cheaper and A+ service."}
{"text":"Went on ladies night and had a blast! Fifty cent drinks for ladies before eleven. The DJ played a mix of country and hip hop. My only complaint about the music is when a Dj repeats a song within a three hour time frame. ESPECIALLY when it's the wobble wobble, cupid shuffle, electric slide type song. 

Bathrooms were clean. Staff was mediocre. Not horrible but not friendly. I know it's busy and there's lots of personalities to deal with but it wouldn't hurt to smile once in a while. 

Didn't eat here and based on the reviews I never plan to. Great place for happy hour and ladies night! Lots of eye candy! Great mix of people. Oh, and if you're lucky you might spot your favorite fellow Yelper, Dallas! Apparently he lives there!"}
{"text":"Alcoholic beverages in Mason jars, yes please! Ya they are $18 but they are hefty and delicious! I tried the Georgia Peach and Whiskey girl and they were both very good! AND to top it off if you don't finish it they will give you a to-go cup!!! Only in Vegas :)

Food is a little over-priced for what you get, in my opinion, but still it was good. Our waitress was super nice and pretty, you don't get that very often~ So needless to say we were thankful.

I am not a fan of country, at all- but my friends are, either way I enjoyed coming here for dinner then leaving :)"}
{"text":"I wish there was a 0 star option. I've been kicked out of a bar 3 times in my life. All 3 have been here. The first time a friend was accused of puking in the bathroom, the second a friend dropped his phone and was deemed \"drunk\". Then there's last night...The security staff calls themselves regulators. They are insanely strict. While standing talking to a friend at the bar a \"regulator\" approached my friend and escorted him outside and proceeded to kick him out for \"swaying\" and \"slurred speech.\" Then I got kicked out for admitting I was indeed, wait for it...drunk. Isn't that why I just spend $100 at your bar? To get drunk? You're not cops. You're not regulators. You're a bouncer. I've given this place numerous tries cause it's a fun place with great waitress's... And decent prices. But me and my friends won't be returning... Well stick to salties. At least they allow us to get drunk there."}
{"text":"My second time here and the food and atmosphere was awesome the food is a bit pricey but well worth it. Their steaks are cooked to perfections and their drinks were great the customer service was outstanding my only negative is the sides portions are a bit small and their macaroni is plain I give it a 4 out of 5"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here many times before and always had a good experience. This time, we went in around 4pm to get a bite to eat. Sat at the bar, took 25 minutes before anyone offered us a menu- even though they were all looking at us but kept horsing around & talking with other patrons who were obviously dressed to get a free drink. Once we got a menu (with not being asked what we would like to drink- hello? we are sitting at a BAR..) the bartender came back 15 minutes later to wash a glass and I had to let him know we were ready to order. He asked \"what do you want?\". It then took 20 minutes to get one order of appetizer chicken strips. The man who brought it out to us was very nice and polite and was the one to finally ask if we wanted something to drink. It of course took another 20 minutes after being done eating to get the idiot bartenders attention to ask for our bill. Needless to say- we did not tip. I am a big believer in cutting slack because servers/bartenders etc get busy- but really? 4pm on a Tuesday with 8 people at the bar, 5 of them flirting to get on the bartenders good side? I'll waste my time at Denny's down the road.

Toby- I love you but get some new staff."}
{"text":"Well....I don't normally like big bones country men undressing me with their eyes, but it is hard to avoid that here. No, it's not what you think....But there are A LOT of life sized, and larger posters, murals, standing figurines and videos of the country start at this establishment...Many of them featuring his trademark \"Come Hither Cowboy\" look.
Other than the creepiness....This  sports bar type place was a welcome surprise. Searching for a non-buffet, non-fast food dining option gets hard sometimes during a busy trade show at the adjoining property and I was happy to stumble upon Toby Keith's I love this Bar and Grill. It DOES get VERY crowded on Thurs-Fri and Sat nights so be warned...But for the most part it is a country themed casual eatery with an upbeat vibe.
The service both at the tables and at the bar was good, even when busy. The waiters are pretty good ad describing some of the more \"eclectic\" items on the menu such as the fired bologna sandwich or the fried macaroni balls. The food was, I would say, a slight improvement on a Chili's or TGI Fridays type Americana type offering. Several fried southern surprises, as mentioned above...But I had both some appetizers, a salad and a burger, and all came as I ordered and were tasty and a good value. A great combination. HOWEVER, they do offer the \"100oz Challenge\" which, as I had heard was a giant burger, fried and beer..All totaling a combined 100 ounces. This is one of those John Canyd type challenges where you get a \"hootn and a hollerin\" reception when you ordered it, and a TShirt and Polaroid if you finish it...And a double bypass in a year or two.
All in all a great dining, and drinking option tucked away in Harrahs Las Vegas. Keep up the good work...Yall!"}
{"text":"We read all the reviews, so we weren't expecting much in the way of service.  However, we were pleasantly surprised.  

We decided to go on a Saturday at lunchtime (around 12:30ish), so we figured it might be busy.  It wasn't completely full, but it's a big place and most of the tables were occupied.  The numerous TV's had college games on, which we love, so that was enjoyable.  We were seated, and our waitress came right over for our drink order.  As soon as our drinks were brought over, we ordered an appetizer (potato skins), and told her to give us a few minutes to decide on our entrees.  She came back a few minutes later, and we ordered...no problem with service, in our eyes.

The potato skins were really good.  They gave us 2 nice scoops of sour cream (hubby always complains that most places never give you enough to put on the skins).  They weren't greasy, and were cut in inch wide strips, as opposed to scooped out.  I found them easier to eat this way.  Not too much cheese, a nice amount of bacon, love the chives added on and they were crispy.  (A busboy came over after we finished, and asked if he could take our plate.)

A few minutes later, our main courses arrived.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich.  In the picture it showed cole slaw on it, but it was actually on the side.  So, he piled it onto the pork.  I got the American Soldier burger--no cheese-- with a side of onion rings.  I also asked for a bit of BBQ sauce for my burger, which was quickly brought over.  While I was setting up my burger, putting the red onions, tomatoes, mustard and BBQ sauce on it, my husband downed his sandwich.  I think he liked it!  My burger was cooked perfectly, nice and charred on the outside, but juicy inside.  The only issue I had was the bun being a little too big.  But, that's a personal taste thing, and my husband loved the bun.  The onion rings were crispy, and I used the extra BBQ sauce to dip them in.  My husbands fries looked pretty good, and he seemed to enjoy them.

Overall, the food was pretty good, and the service was nice.  There were lots of waitresses around, but they all seemed to be helping tables and not standing around chatting.  So, maybe someone is reading the reviews and made some changes.

Also, as a side note, the bathrooms are big and clean (at least they were on a Saturday afternoon).  I'm sure on a Friday or Saturday night, the place is loud and hopping.  But, that's not for us, so we wouldn't be going at those times anyway.  Maybe some of the bad reviews were down to growing pains, and hopefully, they've matured enough that more good reviews will be coming."}
{"text":"Toby Keith's is a party and everyone is always invited!  The bands they have are great, at least the ones I've seen there.  The food is amazing, large portions and filling.  The wait staff is also one of the best in the city.  At the end of my experience, I always find myself echoing Toby's words, I love this bar!

As for food, I've had the fried bologna sandwich, and a few other of the sandwiches.  They come hot and delicious out of the kitchen with \"freedom fries.\"  The freedom fries were some of the best I've had.  Also I tend to drink a lot of soda and my glass was never empty thanks to the amazing waitresses!  

The entertainment- the dance floor is never empty, even between sets as the house music tends to get at least a few people on the floor.  Then the band comes back and it kicks into high gear.  The bands take requests and even though it is a Country music bar, I've heard them cover Rock and Pop hits as well.  

If you're not having a good time by the time you leave, I'm not sure Vegas is for you.  Hopefully you'll try it and find out you too love this bar!"}
{"text":"Horrible food & service. Have been here several times in past and was great. Will not come back after this experience."}
{"text":"when you're tired of eating at the buffets try this place -

the good - hot food servers with butt-less chaps on, picture hooter girls some wearing cowboy hats and all wearing gorgeous smiles while serving you huge meaty sandwiches

I had the steak sandwich and it was awesome - this is literally a strip steak in a hogie roll with grilled onions, mushroom and cheese.  

Another visit I had the Reuben - again this place did not miss - lots of corned beef brisket, topped with bacon - lots of meat!

the bad - the crowd, the drunks, the way too loud competing music - for some reason they keep the piped in music on even when the live bad is playing - 

the meh --- flair bartenders who do tricks by request (tips) the bar was lit on fire twice while we were there less than an hour"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We had a large group of about 20.  Our server could barely keep up.  Food was decent but drinks were overpriced for what you got.  A large drink in a Mason jar is $20.50,  ours was weak mixed and when we complained about it the manager and bartender acted like it was a problem to fix (attitude and body expression spoke loads).  Highly doubt we'll return after seeing the attitude of the place."}
{"text":"Seriously,  you now have been open for two years now and you still can't get your management and employees to provide decent food or service. This restaurant has tarnished The Toby Keith brand. The writing is on the wall; this chain wasn't the salvation to Improve Park West, you made it worse. Pack up and get out!!"}
{"text":"I have to preface this review by saying that I am a big Toby Keith fan (I've seen him in concert) and an even bigger country music fan, so those of you who aren't will take this review with a grain of salt (and tequila and a slice of lime hehe).  That said - my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our dinner here, and I think it was probably the best meal we had on our recent trip to Vegas, which is sort of sad.    

We went for the fun atmosphere (there is Toby memorabilia everywhere and they play country music videos non-stop, which are about 2/3rds Toby Keith ones), but we were surprised that we actually really enjoyed the food!  We split the chicken fried steak ($16) and had more than enough for 2.  We were planning to order a dessert as well, but ended up being too full.  The steak itself was very tasty, and was served with gravy and excellent mashed potatoes.  The mac and cheese we chose as our side was more mediocre, but it also came with some cornbread, and some bread with sweet honey butter, which was really delicious.  

Service was friendly, if a little confusing (she failed to bring us the cornbread at first, and when we asked for it, she said they didnt have any and that was why it hadn't come out, but then she brought some immediately).  

Definitely one of the better options on the strip for moderately priced, tasty food, and I highly recommend, especially if you're a country fan."}
{"text":"Poor beer selection and horrible job filtering out the cigarette smoke. I couldn't breathe in there."}
{"text":"If it had been my choice I would NEVER have come here. I hate Toby Keith, but it was a friend's bachlorette/bachelor party and they picked the place for dinner

Despite making reservations they weren't ready for us. Our group ended up being split over two large tables of about 12ppl and one small table of 4. Not close enough for conversations between the groups. 

The food was fine. Nothing amazing but not inedible. Most people had a burger, I got a chicken fried steak. Why I have no idea. It was good enough I guess. 

The drinks were GOOD. Pretty much what got this to 3 stars. Granted it was $20 for one drink, but the one drink was in a 32 oz mason jar and had something like 5 shots in it.

Our waitress was great. She was nice and as quick as could be for a large party.

Over all I wouldn't head back but mostly just because I wouldn't have gone their in the first place if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Toby's was a Great disappointment this time. We LOVE to go but the menu changed and not for the better . They no longer have the chicken and ham sandwich and the tortilla soup tasted like chili. I did not eat it. They also don't have Miller light in draft so that too was not a plus. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!!"}
{"text":"Good food with nice views. Lol.  Had ribs and Mac and cheese balls. All very good. Going to try the bread pudding."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it first opened, however, now this place just makes me so irritated. Everything you are reading here about your employees and service is mostly true! Bouncers and bartenders always seem irritated or mad at the world. Terrible service and bouncers seem strange as if they can't go one night without HAVING to kick people out like there's a minimum standard they have to uphold. I asked one bartender if there was anything Toby's does for birthdays and he replied with a rude, quick, \"No\", turned around quickly and left our bar area. When a friend later during the night noticed there was a display on the TV about a birthday dinner of some sort. Whatever. Anyways, you can be assured my friends and I will NOT be returning to this place ever. I'm surprised you guys aren't closed down yet."}
{"text":"I'm not a big country buff but the atmosphere is pretty kick back. The food was ehh alright it wasn't anything spectacular. Came here for New Years and I wasn't really feeling the whole country live band. I'd say if your not too big on country I wouldn't recommend coming here for New Years. However if you wanna try something new and different it's a place I'd recommend to try at least once."}
{"text":"Two words...COWBOY REUBEN!

Grilled rye piled high...with corned beef, Swiss cheese, coleslaw, bacon, and jalapeno ranch dressing served with a heaping side of fries.  All the flavours meshed together wonderfully...I've never met a reuben with coleslaw instead of sauerkraut that I didn't like!  Bacon added a nice touch and a little extra crispiness.  It almost made me want to ride the mechanical bull out of sheer excitement but that will have to wait for another day.

Service was friendly and (at lunch time) quite fast.  
And the waitresses all wear short shorts (sometimes with chaps) if you are into that sorta thing."}
{"text":"Food as service can be rated as okay. To me, this place offers nothing special. The food is somewhat bland and the beers are over priced."}
{"text":"Tobys is finally back on top!! We went there 2 x this past week, and both times we saw rockin country bands! We also passed by there during the day, and they had country videos on. No crappy techno/dance music. Tobys went back to their roots and was all country all the time. I love that! There are a million places in Vegas to hear dance music, so we dont need it in here too. LOVE the huge drinks, southern menu and party atmosphere. Def recommend."}
{"text":"Made a reservation and still has to wait over 15 minutes when the restaurant was not even half full. Our son sat down in the floor and the host told him to get up. Finally got a table then waited another 20 minutes before we could get water. Then another 10 before anyone took our order. Not sure about the food yet because we may never get it."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place after reading the reviews, so I stopped in on a Saturday for lunch.  12 noon and I am the 9th person in the entire place (2 at the bar and 8 in the dining area). The bartender greeted me promptly but I had to ask her for a beer options menu because I did not see any taps (they were around the corner).  I ordered the \"cowboy BBQ\" burger and a draft.  
I was going to watch some sports on the TVs but they had two channels on: The Toby Keith Bar channel which only ran ads about the restaurant and the Discovery channel.  No sports. 
The hamburger arrived and it was only warm, not hot and the fries were barely warm; it had obviously sat on the shelf for awhile in the kitchen until someone remembered to bring it out (and a reminder; only 9 customers in the place).  
Another server came up a few feet away from me and proceeded to tell my server in a loud voice how drunk and stupid she got last night; this was way too much information when I am trying to enjoy my mediocre lunch.  
Then I saw the the TV ads talked about the \"club\" that you join and you get a free meal on your birthday plus other specials.  It stated to download the app onto your smartphone.  I tried that; no app.  So I asked my server and she said that Toby Keith's had stopped that promotion months ago because they were losing too much money.  She also said they simply had not changed the ads so everybody keeps asking her about the \"club\".
Summary:  I am not impressed.  With only 9 customers my food should have been to me piping hot, there should be some sports on the TVs, the servers should keep their personal lives quiet and if you have changed your \"Club\" policy then change the ads!  Every other month I get a coupon via e-mail from TGI Friday's offering 25% off your entire table meal cost.  Now that's a \"customer loyalty\" program which keeps me coming back to spend money with them, and you earn points for free meals.

PS:  The server told me that they are going to close for lunch Mon-Fri due to the lack of business."}
{"text":"Massive draft brews, sizable servings and waitresses in buttless leather chaps. Live music too. Recommended, but make the guys spiff it up a little. They don't hold a candle to the gals!"}
{"text":"I had the fried catfish which was great.  The fish was moist and flaky and had a nice cornmeal crunchy exterior.  The wife had a barbecue chicken sandwich which was terrible.  It was really tough and stringy, way overcooked.

We had a large party and they were unwilling to split up the check which was a pain.  Everyone was digging out cash or feeling uncomfortable to put it on their card.  They had live music playing which we enjoyed, and even a small dance floor for some to go out to.

Overall it was an inconsistent experience with some high points and low points."}
{"text":"Not local friendly.not very accommodating for groups larger than 6 or so.average staff at best. Foods ok,service needs work.I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is always packed in Foxboro MA, so I thought I'd check it out in Vegas. Huge burger that was juicy (to the point of the bun falling apart) with homestyle french fries.

Waitress was friendly and prompt. Food was a little slow, but likely that's because it takes time to cook a thick burger from scratch. Overall a pleasant experience, but not much different from a Ruby Tuesday or TGIF (I'd thought it would be different from them somehow)."}
{"text":"I ordered an Old West hamburger.  The hamburger was good but the onion rings and fries tasted as if they were cooked in old grease  I ate a few but couldn't stand the taste.  Later that evening I got sick from eating the few fries.  It is disappointing that Toby Keith has a restaurant that serves such terrible food that people are getting sick.  Not good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If Toby Keith really loves this place, he would fire the current chefs and hire new ones.  

The service was very nice but the food............bleh!  One of the worst BBQ Baby Back Ribs I've had.  It was dry and not much taste.  The Jumbo Fried Shrimps were so heavily battered, it tasted more like donut shrimps.  

I've come to the conclusion that Harrah's gives away food vouchers because no one would actually come here to eat if they had to pay for it!  Well, certainly not me."}
{"text":"Went with some cowboys from out of town recently.  Ordered a salad with grilled chicken on top.  Chicken came out like jerky, as if it had been sitting out for days.  I sent it back and what I got back wasn't much better.  Looked and tasted like boiled chicken strips.  Ask the others in my party and not one could say their meal was outstanding.  Had a bite of my Mom's chicken-fried steak and I've had better from IHOP which is not saying much at all.  I am disappointed with Harrah's for allowing this type of sub standard food go to people visiting our city.  Step it up if you're going to charge people that amount of money!!  Other than the food the place looked good and loved the shots given out at the bar after the alarm sounded.  New chefs would complete this place!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars! This place is absolutely horrible. Took 10 minutes to get someone to take our drink order, and there were only 5 other tables in the entire place. Took another 10 minutes to get our drinks (water), and when we got our appetizers, 15 minutes after that, it was cold. Tried to give it another chance, but will absolutely not ever be going back here. Bummer too, because they have some good concerts coming up!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star, I would!  (one star for the nice young girl bartender-wish I'd gotten her name!).  We had a group of 12 that came in for Superbowl.  We were all from out of town for the Super Bowl (California and Washington) and could not get into a bar at West Gate so decided to give this place a try (some of the employees were handing out info for the bar up at West Gate and said it wasn't crowded like the ones we were trying to get into).  We spent the whole game at Toby Keith's, eating (food is just o.k. and we never had a waitress wait on us-had to order everything up at the bar), drinking, and watching the game.  After the game we decided to stay a bit since most of us love country music and the band seemed pretty good.  My 23 year old daughter and a friend were dancing and just enjoying the music and having a good time, when two bouncers walked up to her and told her they needed to see her outside.  Well, obviously after reading other reviews regarding the same issue, they told her they had had a \"complaint\" from a customer that she was drunk and out of hand and that she would not be allowed to come back in. . . not even to get all her belongings!!!  My daughter was not drunk.  Yes, she had had some drinks (2 beers and 2 shots in 7 hours!), but she was not out of control, drunk, or disorderly.  She was not stumbling, falling or being obnoxious.  She was having fun and dancing and that is all.  The bouncers were rude and bullies. One of them actually grabbed the neck of my daughter's friend while we were all standing outside \"discussing\" this.  The manager was just as bad standing up for these thugs he calls bouncers and not listening to what any of us had to say.  These people are ruining this business.  My family has been in the restaurant business for years, and I know that treating customers is a top priority or your business fails.  This place, this manager and these so called moron bouncers need to take a good hard look at what they are doing.  I even called the next morning to get the manager's name and the young girl on the phone would not give it to me.  Said she didn't know his name!  Really, and you work there?  I will be emailing corporate and giving them a call to discuss the treatment we received at this place.  I have never seen any place ever treat customers the way this place does.  I would advise anyone thinking of going there to think twice."}
{"text":"Toby Keith's was great. We had a group of 20 and without a hitch they sat us down and began to make our experience a super good one. Jessica, dedicated just to us,our waitress did not skip a beat. She served us all efficiently and divided our check with out a problem, even gave us a 20% military discount to those that it applied to. After our meal the live band came on, it was around 930, and they were good. 

The wings, fries, ribs and chicken fried steak were delicious. It was plenty of food even had left overs. The prices were not to bad one would expect it to be more expensive. I do recommend Toby Keith's with our experience. I read other reviews and was skeptical about it but our experience was great."}
{"text":"Delicious soldier burger, fries, & apple pie.  Great music. A little pricey but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Just like every other Musician-themed bar/grill, being a huge fan of the involved is a big deal.
I am not the biggest Toby Keith fan, but here it wasn't too big of a deal. Sure the walls are lined with images and items from his career, enough that part of our conversation was \"If Toby Keith were to actually come here, would he be super embarrassed by how much this place is a shrine to him or would he own it and purposefully wear an outfit from one of the photos and get the table underneath said photo?\"
In all seriousness, the decor was a little overdone. Unlike, say, Margaritaville, which I would say is \"Parrothead- and Jimmy-Buffet's-MUSIC-themed,\" I Love This Bar is simply \"Toby Keith-themed,\" which is a bit off-putting. It's like the cafeteria of the Toby Keith Museum.
The food and service were definitely good. My burger was well-cooked and tasty, and the service was fine. It was a little strange that they took and then tried to sell us a souvenir photo of us at our table.
As always the food was forced-pun titled. The music was of course a mix of new and old country, which I was fine with. I'll come back to this place, but only if I was with someone else who wanted to go. It wouldn't be my recommendation."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant so much we ate dinner here 2 nights out of the 3 we were in Vegas. We stayed at The Cosmopolitan and we walked late the first night so it wasn't terribly hot all the way to Harrah's stopping to watch the cool sidewalk shows and random attractions of people.Then we walked the second  time in the early evening when it was about 107 out all the way to Harrah's again! Ridiculous walk! But worth it. Plus right outside of Harrah's there is a outside bar/club Carnaval I think it was called and they have a booth that makes enormous drinks for about 40$ and we got one of those to keep us company. ;)

Good food, excellent service, great fun atmosphere. At first I was hesitant to go to a country based bar since that's never really been my cup of tea, but to my surprise, I had a great time! On Saturday night there was a live band singing cover songs, they did an excellent job! The woman could really sing! There were people swing dancing and line dancing all over. It was a good time. Our waitress was the little blonde woman, she had so much energy and was the sweetest cutest waitress ever. She rocked the heck out of her butt-less chap outfit with the rhinestone booty shorts! My husband and I ordered a hamburger and a quesadilla and split the two. Food was good. We also got the mason jar of the Georgia Peach. It was good, but a little bit too sweet for me. 

The second night (Sunday night) there was no live band, must be a Saturday only thing. We ordered Toby's Big Daddy Platter. It was delicious. I have never had deep fried macaroni and cheese balls, not sure if I would ever particularly order it but I loved it from there! I got a Ranch House salad (which was huge for the price). Don't remember exactly what my husband ordered but he loved it. We also got the boot souvenir drink cup this time filled with The Patriot I believe. We asked for the least sweet tasting one on the menu and it was delicious. Got to take the boot home back to California. 

This is a fun place for all ages! I will definitely come here again when I take another trip to Vegas. I forgot to mention this place is pretty affordable, the drinks were strong and fairly priced and the food was decently priced and you got a lot of it!!"}
{"text":"Had a couple of beers and listened to a great country cover band.  Awesome.   Had no food but I would go just for the bands and beer."}
{"text":"Good burgers.....very professional  staff even though  their  wearing chaps with panties everything was Fresh & good. KELLY my server was on point checking  everytime on me whenevwr she passed by. Good food GREAT SERVICE...!"}
{"text":"We make it to Vegas at least twice a year, so we try a lot of different places. If you like country music and chicken wings, you must try this place. The music is a little on the loud side, but if you don't mind that it's a great environment to have a drink and grab a bite."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar to watch the game. The bar tender was great, drinks were good and he was very on top of things. I gave it a 2 star because the food wasn't really that great. I was kinda disappointed because I was looking forward to eating there. There's lots of other really good food on the strip to eat. This really just isn't one of them."}
{"text":"OK, I have to say we were sitting at the bar and usually bartenders are a little slower when ordering your food. It wasn't busy at all and as expected, yeah it took awhile for the food to come out.  I asked for ranch three times for my fries from three different employees and never got it.  Again, it wasn't busy at all and the service was terrible. I hate when you can't get ranch with your fries.  Sandwich was below par also."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was delicious and huge. The fried bologna sandwich is my favorite. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Really good, cost effective specials and the steak was amazing"}
{"text":"Great bar good pull pork sandwich great drinks party atmosphere waitresses in chaps
are very nice"}
{"text":"Welcome to Toby Keith's \"cashing in on my name\" Bar & Grill. If you've lived long enough in Arizona, you WILL embrace the country scene at some point. If you don't like it, someone you hang out with does, so put on your Wranglers, saddle up, and get your ass in here.

Let me get the good out of the way--if you like day drinking, you will like this place. The happy hour is 11-7, and the frozen margaritas will knock you on your ass. Good prices on domestic drafts, too. I'm a sucker for the red solo cups. Additionally, the level of atmosphere is off the charts! Wooden decor everywhere, and all country, all the time. I would listen to artists like Jason Aldean over garbage like Drake and Ke$ha any day. 

As other reviews have pointed out, service blows. They are totally personable, but the large space has them walking around in circles, as if they are having trouble figuring out what to do next. A simple appetizer took 30 minutes to show up, and it wasn't even busy! 

I won't knock them too much for that, because just like restaurants in Westgate, the nightlife and not the food is obviously the main attraction. The stage is huge, and there's plenty of room. I haven't gone on a busy Saturday night yet, but it looks promising. As always, I'll keep you updated!"}
{"text":"There were 3 of us yesterday for lunch.  We had a young friendly, informative waitress named The Bronx (OOOPS, I meant Brooklyn)  LOL  She answered all our questions and the service was great.  Reliable and very efficient.  She was really on the ball.
This restaurant is quite large and there is a very small lunch crowd.
We had appetizers (fried zucchini, potato skins) and I had the pulled chicken sandwich. One of our group had the BBQ ribs.  We all remarked about the tasty food.
Reading these reviews here I thought the place was going to be a flop. We talked with Brooklyn and she said they had a big shake up there.  Fired many, many employees and hired as many new ones.  Apparently many of these reviews were from when they were first opened.
Another plus is that they have my favorite beer on tap, Kiltlifter.
You really need some good photos on the below portion which asks if these photos are helpful?
If you want some good ones please feel free to get in touch.

{"text":"I don't really know what I expected for this establishment. I am not a Toby Keith fan...at all. We ended up there after all being too hungry and walking aimlessly trying to make a decision on where to eat. Our waitress was nice, but the meal took a very long time to come out. Once the food was served everyone's food was mediocre at best. The prices are high for what it is, just be prepared for an underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"Food was great, large portions, fried items not greasy, huge beers.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great time. The service was great, the food was great and we had a blast kicking up our heels for the first time in a long time. Wish this place was closer to Mesa. After our disappointing lunch at Toby Keith's in Mesa, I was relieved to find the Peoria Toby Keith's is clean and even though the place was packed, our dinners came out fast, hot and delicious. The employees were sweet and took great care of us. The band was great and even though a lot of the couples on the dance floor seemed like they were dance professionals, we were comfortable in our own world, dancing our way:) we had a blast together!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of gimmicky restaurants or country music.  I met a friend here and even though I wanted to hate it, the loaded nachos were excellent. The music sucked though."}
{"text":"I was here the last time I was in Vegas and the service was much better.  This time we were here the service at the bar was really fun and prompt, we had a few mason jars of beer and an appetizer while we waited for our table.  I wish we would have just stayed at the bar!  Once we were seated it took 15 minutes for the waitress to even acknowledge us, then 40 minutes for our food to come out and my husband's pulled pork sandwich and fries were so cold I actually sent back food for the first time in my entire life.  Once it came back out it was good, and my salad with chicken was perfect.  The greens and veggies were very very cold, and the chicken was perfect.  Also, it was so large that I couldn't finish it...when is the last time that a garden salad was so big you couldn't finish it?  I really appreciated having a good size serving of a healthy option in the sea of gluttony that Vegas can be.  Overall, the atmosphere is really fun if you like country music but I would just grab a seat at the bar and eat there while you are entertained by wonderful bartenders!!"}
{"text":"Alright I am still so LIVID about this place that I am not even going to make this a very long review because its too painful but I will say AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS unless you're going there to dance and drink. The food was TERRIBLE. My friend got chicken strips that weren't even cookied and I got this buffalo chicken wrap that was not even edible. Which coming from me NEVER happens especially when I am paying $14 for the item but it literally tasted like Vinegar wrapped in a sundried tomato tortilla. The hotsauce and the Guacamole and chicken was just non existent in the flavoring and I literally had to dip the darn thing in Queso just to be able to eat half of it . Which I only did because ...You guessed it.. the thing cost $14. We had initially been downtown and decided to check this place out because they had a veterans day special for a free burger which my boyfriend took advantage of and for being a free burger he was able to eat it but the fact of the matter is. Even Checkers does it better!  I really enjoy Toby Keith's music and I like the atmosphere with the pretty ladies in their backless chaps but we didn't even end up with a hot waitress and the music was so loud that was playing I couldn't even complain to our waitress if I wanted to but I just couldn't even stomach the energy after how bad everything was. I will hopefully be uploading some photos to cement the fact you shouldn't bother with this place but it's me and I am not always that good at attention to detail. This would have to be one of the first places I have not been able to finish my food though. I am the queen of eating pretty much anything but this place failed hardcore. The chips and Queso was definitely from a Can but that at least tasted good just wasn't worth the $... Definitely try somewhere else if you have the chance!"}
{"text":"Can't imagine the 3 star rating.  Some of the best food overall I've ever had with fast service.  Would have given them 5 stars if they had more booths and I didn't have to look at ass cheeks in my face off and on from some of the waitresses; despite being a healthy, hetrosexual male...I'm trying to eat here."}
{"text":"There was a party the night my grandparents and I went and all the waitresses gave their attention and focus on them. They dimmed the lights and my grandfather couldn't see his food hours before the party arrived. Saw our waitress twice once to take our order and to drop off the bill, which we had to ask for by the hostess. The place had barely anybody so they couldn't be distracted by anything but that party. Food was great just very disappointing service. Worst part about this is the business won't acknowledge this comment/review because the number in that party will give a better review because they had better service and attention. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my brisket tacos. They were jam packed with meat and had a great flavor. I also really enjoyed the drinks I ordered. I had the \"toad suck pond\" and the peach margarita, both were very tasty! The food my family ordered however was just okay."}
{"text":"Great food.  I had club sandwich that was freaking huge for 12.95.  Best value for lunch in Vegas and female servers in chaps is a nice bonus.  Definitely would return ti this establishment."}
{"text":"All I have to say is no. You should just cook at home because at Toby's you will practically serve your self!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say I love country music as a whole, but I do love Toby Keith!  So, had to come here to check it out. And glad we did. Even if you hate country music you will have a great time! Food is good, but not superb. We were more there for drinks and entertainment.  They have lots of signature drinks, Toadsuck Pond was my personal favorite! I recommend sitting at the bar if there is room. Bartenders are great. Music is awesome (can't believe I said that). My husband and I come to Vegas almost every year and we always stop by Toby Keith's for a good time!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool country western bar located on the 2nd floor inside the Harrahs Casino.
Free to get in, and some live music.  The night i stopped by, the band playing was Cash Presley..  Pretty good band.
Get ready to get your honky tonk on if you come here.
Drinks, well, lets just say, a bud light was 6.50...but hey, its Vegas.."}
{"text":"I hope Toby Keith recognizes what a joke this place is. The servers are very nice and well-intentioned, but the food is barely edible and exorbitantly over-priced. Beer selection favors bubbas and my grandfather. Be prepared for idiocracy at its finest."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the Buffalo wrap,and found a piece of what looks like blue latex glove in it! We won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best and this place is way past it's prime as a fun place. The service is also very slow."}
{"text":"Waitresses were very friendly and wear ass-less chaps. Burgers were delicious. Beer was cold. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place really surprised me...it was a last minute decision...although i wasnt in the mood for a 'dark country bar restaurant experience' for lunch but the waitress was really friendly and knowledgable about the menu...we had the reuben which was delicious! she recommended the slaw and sauce on the side and i'm glad i took her up on it so that i could choose how much i wanted...the portions are large (which she also told us in advance) so we split the sandwich and were stuffed! i'd also recommend the fresh sweet iced tea...it was extremely refreshing and she even offered us a to go iced tea :)"}
{"text":"My first time ever coming here and it was surprisingly for a memorial. There were 50 of us and understandably trying to get us all together was hard, they set up 2 long tables side by side for us. Our menu was already picked out for us. We received an appetizer plate with chicken wings, onion rings and jalapeño poppers. I only tried the onion rings which were so good I think they might have been beer battered but not 100% sure. I also tried the chicken wings and when they say chicken wings they mean chicken wings, they are not the little wings you would expect when ordering chicken wings they are the real deal and the buffalo sauce was on the side. Everyone loved the jalapeño poppers that's why I didn't get any. Their sweet tea was a little to sweet for me, I had to order a regular. For my main course I had the chicken salad, my plate was huge full of lettuce cucumbers, carrots, celery and maybe 3-4 small chicken strips on top. Don't get me wrong I thought it was good I just wish there was more chicken. My husband had ribs and my daughter had a steak and their portion was no where near mine. The moment I was waiting for the fried Twinkie! I have been wanting to try one of these for a while now, and I thought it was yummy. The service was great, especially for us being such a big party. One of my brothers food didn't come out with the rest of our and the server went back to fix the problem the manager came over and was talking to my brother and comped a free beer for the wait. I definitely want to go back when I can look at the menu and try whatever I want because the sample I had was great. I definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.  The service is lacking.  Let me explain.
When your waitress takes your order, and you order appetizers, there is a good chance your main course will arrive with, or even before, your appetizer.  It's not the fault of the waitress, she always asks if we wanted the appetizer first, then the main course.  The problem is the process in which your food is delivered to your table.  Your waitress doesn't deliver, your food is delivered by other staff.  I'm quite sure the waitress and the cooks are on the same page, but the food delivery people don't seem to be in on the communication chain.  
All that said, just order appetizers first, and order your main dish AFTER you receive your appetizer or when you're ready.  
Great tip: Wednesday is .25 cent wing night, and Thursday is $6 steak night.  Great value!"}
{"text":"My son had a hamburger with cheese and bacon via room service from here and said that the food was sick, so I gave it a try and had a few bites and he was right. One of the most disgusting hamburgers out there. I regret not sending it back."}
{"text":"Fun ambiance if you really like country music, but not enough going on. The house band is pretty good, and cute. The bartenders are quick. Drinks are big, expensive and don't usually taste right. We had a lot of fun dancing and hanging out, but had to settle for icecream outside instead of food because the hostess was being difficult. Either way, we had fun"}
{"text":"The ex got me a tank top here that I still wear and my main key ring is a big fake diamond ring with a tag that says \"High Maintenance Woman\" - yeah, pretty accurate. But I have never eaten here before this summer. I came in just before lunch on a weekday and it wasn't busy. I grabbed a seat at the bar with intentions of gambling while I ate. I also watched part of a baseball game next to a gent wearing some Giants gear.

I ordered the buffalo wings, extra crispy but they weren't that crispy. The sauce was pretty good though. I did stick with a water as I didn't get back to my room until 4 or so in the morning. And how appropriate that it was served in a Red Solo Cup. (\"Let's have a party!) The bartenders were entertaining and very casual. They also had a huge projector screen in the back and country music playing. Not just by Toby either so that was nice. I love me some country music so I was A-OK with the entertainment. I'd come back."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good looking bar. It's large and gots to be a lot of fun on a Friday night with line dancing and two steppin. Put on your boots, a cowboy hat and come have some half price appetizers which are pretty good for the price. However I was told they got wrote up on channel 5 for dirty dining. Makes you wonder."}
{"text":"Toby Keith's bar has a great vibe, complete with a mounted guitar on the ceiling along with area of the bar. Drinks were great, food deliciois. Lots of televisions for spoting events and a fun light hearted staff."}
{"text":"Came in here looking for a lively country bar in Vegas, let me say this is not it. The bartenders and staff are very nice. The atmosphere has more of an older crowd, my friend and I were the only ones doing line dancing. We had an okay time. We asked for a special 9$ jar for both of us and received a bill for 50$! We let it go and went on with our night but even the nicest clubs in vegas are not that much! Added bonus everyon starts leaving around 12 and you yourself will have to leave before 1 or youll be bounced out too!"}
{"text":"Another Vegas tourist trap.  The buffalo wings we had were dry and flavorless, took way too long to get to the table, which might explain why they were kinda cold.  The pulled pork sandwich was ok.  The famous fried bologna sandwich could have been a lot better.  We sat at the bar so we expected better service than we got.  I'd rather get my beer than watch the bar tenders kill time spinning and throwing liquor bottles, but that's just me.  Stop in for a drink I suppose, if you want to pay that much for drinks ($7 for a miller lite).  We did enjoy the band and we like how active duty military personnel are treated, we did see a marine who just got married.  Other than those upsides, this place is not a hit."}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied with the food. It's always made to order and never disappoints a hungry pallet. The service sometimes can be slow, but it has a tendency to be busy on most all of my visits. I've been here 5 times and plan on returning again in the future. Fun and friendly atmosphere. More geared though towards adults, but kids are welcome!"}
{"text":"Really? Really, Really? I don't love this bar, or grill.
So, the atmosphere is cool if you like the honky tonk country vibe, and I do, I was feeling it. That is until the food came out. 

I got the blackened catfish with mac n cheese and mashed sweet potatoes. Nastyyyyyyy. The mac n cheese, is like Kraft times 1,000, almost powdery? 
The apple salsa on top was all apple no salsa. yeahhh, whatever.
You get cornbread before hand, it was very dry, not moist at all. 

My friend got fish and chips, she kinda hated it. My other friends got a spinach salad, and a BBQ chicken sandwich, which they enjoyed. 
The service was kinda terrible, she had like 7 tables and was running around like a chicken with her head cut off.
There are so many other places to eat in Vegas, I'd pass this one up, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOVE TOBY KEITH."}
{"text":"I was extremely surprised at how good my food was.  I had the rib and wings combo and it was really good.  My brother got the boot and I could not believe how much alcohol was poured into one drink.  He really enjoyed it.  Ha ha  The one issue I saw was their service.  I saw a lot of the bartenders and wait staff either sitting talking to one another or talking \"too long\" to just one customer.  They are friendly but when I need a drink I don't need you to be talking to another customer for 15 mins.  Great food but service stinks.  

Make sure to bring your players card.  You get like $2 off each entree..."}
{"text":"Every time we go here, the bouncers try to mess with me. I've had them go so far as to tell me there was a warrant out for my arrest after they scanned my ID (which is not funny, because some scanners really can pick that up). If they're not pulling something like that, they're checking my picture against my face for a good minute before deciding it's not a fake. 

This last time though really irritated me. I hand this Duck Dynasty wannabe my ID and watch him read it. I guess that was suspicious, because he looked up from it and stared at me intently. I stared right back, and apparently he didn't like that, because he then asked \"Where are you coming from?\"  \"Oh, the Tim McGraw concert.\"  He gets this super serious look. \"How much have you had to drink?\"

Which really ticked me off, because I had not had one single sip of alcohol all night.

\"Nothing. At all.\"   
Phil Jr. stares at me some more, and finally lets me in, but I remained annoyed for the rest of the evening. 

Being treated like you're underage with a fake, or already drunk when you're not, gets really old when it's every single time you get to a bar."}
{"text":"My friend really likes country music so I had to honour her request and visit this place.  The gift shop is overpriced.  The cover band wasn't as bad as I thought they'd be.  We met some fellow, friendly, not creepy bay area boys here so I guess it earns an extra star for that.  This isn't anything special.  It seems like so many celebrities are trying to cash in on their name, especially in Vegas.  I mean we walked by Vince Neil's (of Motley Crue) Ink just before going to Harrah's (where this bar is located) and Trump tower was close by as well.  We got a lot of strange looks in and outside of the hotel for our mason jarred drinks.  They were cheaper that way than buying an actual regular drink.  Perhaps we went on a decent night.  The crowd seemed to love this place.  I was just kinda ehhh on it.  We walked around in a big circle to get to this place the first time we went here but our other friend found it with no problem."}
{"text":"Hand's down love this place. Try the Georgia Peach drink. I died haha, The mac and Cheese balls hit the spot and the ruben sandwich topped it off. I left happy, the atmosphere is not what you'd expect which made me love it even more. The waiters and waitresses are awesome they are on it and get you your things fast. All around 5 stars."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love this bar! Went Friday and Saturday night. The bartenders are great and pour a nice drink. The mason jars are a fun option that fit the theme. The music and the crowd were hopping. Going back tonight hoping the boss will stop by after the ACM awards."}
{"text":"Speed in after a movie with another couple. Not impressed. Rack of ribs were absolutely torched on one side and for the portions the prices are ridiculous. Not for me."}
{"text":"We decided on this location because they were one of the only locations that had space without a wait during the lunch rush.

Toby Keith has a great atmosphere and the waitress wear assless chaps. That took me completely by surprise. Our waitress quickly took our order and was prompt on delivery.

She recommended the steaks, chicken fried steak, and the the fajitas. 

I ordered the combo fajitas which was $25. Unfortunately the food is extremely lacking. Every meal ordered by our party of 9 was disappointing. My meats were bland and flavor less. One of my groups mentioned that my steaks were beef jerky. The food quality wouldn't have been so bad if the prices weren't so unbelievably high for the food. I wouldn't return to this location. They are opening a newer location on my home town so I'll try that once to see if it's similar."}
{"text":"I just had the best fried catfish, okra, green beans and SWEET ICED TEA....EVER! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but service sucks. Dont bother."}
{"text":"This place is pretty crappy compared to the original one in Oklahoma - less of a selection of food ... where's the grilled cheese sammy?!?! ... and it kinda has that Vegas club feel instead of a country bar.  I gave it an A-OK because the prices on beer aren't too bad."}
{"text":"After walking quite a ways through Harrah's to find this place, I was disappointed by the very open layout. There were only 6 booths maybe, and a lot of tables (not very cozy). 

When the waiter finally came over, he was very nice; however we never saw him again until I flagged him down for the check. 

We started with the chicken nachos, which were decent because we were hungry. The entrees came before we even ate half of the appetizer. The country fried steak was tough and not very good. The sides were tiny and came in condiment size plastic cups. There is a $3 charge for sharing an entree!

I wouldn't go back, nor could I recommend going there."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I loved this place.

If you want beer, bbq, drink from a mason jar, and to listen to country music while watch waitresses in chaps, this is the place to be!  If you don't like those things, well you probably won't like this bar then.

I got the appetizer plater and my girlfriends got a bbq plater.  All the food was good and our waitress was super nice.  The ambience was great, and it reminded me of home (I grew up on a ranch in Northern California).  Also they have a giant screen playing country music videos and we were all singing a long when we were here.  

Overall, a fun place to catch dinner!"}
{"text":"Best bbq wings ever! The Mac and Cheese balls are also real good :) can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I too am one of those Tacky Country folk! Ha! we were in town for the PBR (Professional Bull Riders) World Finals. So, of course we had to go to Toby Keith's I love this Bar and Grill. 

We only waited for about 10 minutes for a table during the lunch rush, not bad. The hostess was perky and happy to see us, like we were old friends. She was busing tables as well and kept on going. Love to see a good attitude even when working hard.

Table service was prompt and the waitress polite and full of smiles. 

I had NO idea how HUGE the portions were going to be. But having not eaten since before our flight the night before, we were quite hungry.  My mother in law ans I had the pulled pork sandwiches and my husband a burger. Even with how hungry we were, we had a hard time finishing. The pulled pork was tender and juicy, not to sweet with a little kick. Just the way I like it. Potato salad and a pickle spear, topped off with sweet tea. Absolutely NO complaints.

Service and food were great!

Will visit again should I be in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place sucks!! We came for the Dustin lynch concert, we're told we had to wait outside for 15 minutes.  When we got inside we were told we had to put our name on a list to eat.  Once our name was on the list we waited 35 minutes, as we were waiting random people were walking through the door helping there selves to tables. Not ok! when we went over to ask for the manager the girl at the front decided to be rude. Then... All the sudden it turned into open seating imagine that! Once we ordered food we never saw our waiter until she was ready for money once again imagine that! Worst service ever! Side note you may have better reviews if the 15 girls at the front door actually did something!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to watch the game where we could actually have a seat and watch the TV. All of the tables were taken with a long wait, so we ambled up to the bar. Got them to turn the TV right in front of us to the game and voila! Remained in those said seats for many hours after the game was over. 

Everyone (bartenders and patrons) were super friendly. The drinks are served in mason jars, cute. The nachos were pretty good too. A band came on late night. I did not experience the dancers on the bars as some of the other yelpers have. 

The bathrooms are outside the bar. I hate that about Vegas."}
{"text":"GREAT place for NFL Sunday! 
Televisions everywhere!! 
The fries are so good. The dranks are pricey but definitely worth it. 
I'm not a big country fan but the environment is very welcoming and nice."}
{"text":"I love Toby Keith but if he is in anyway associated to this place you better rethink it. I came in just after one today maybe 35-40 people in the bar, but the place is very big after being told we could sit wherever we wanted is server finally came up after five minutes. Said it wasn't even her station but she was going to help us I was the only help we got from her all day. We ordered two beers 1pint 1mason jar and two waters. It took 10 minutes to get our beers and they were served in plastic cups, I know Tobeys into red solo cups but seriously a Sunday afternoon and they don't have any glasses? The waitress apologized and told us she would repour into glass & told us the bartenders had a busy night last night so there weren't many glasses available , what a joke!!! After 20 more minutes we still have not received our waters nor appetizers and we had no idea where our server was so we threw a 20 down &got up and left.... I will not go back and would urge you not to go at all"}
{"text":"Our food was amazing but our service was complete crap. Our server was so rude and completely unprofessional, Tiffany S. was our waitress. Dh did not bring out the food that was ordered and then argued with us about it. I'm so disappointed. Like I said, the food that we did receive was on point, major high five to the cooks.. as far as our service, she should not have a job in service."}
{"text":"Very long wait for the service and food at the location on Northern.  Our server was very nice, but nice doesn't cut it when you are hungry with hungry kids.  

As for the food...it was mediocre.  On our kids meal we were surprised when we opened the large bun to find a small burger.  My southwest salad was good, but probably better if delivered with dressing.  :0).   My husband and daughter both liked their burger.  Do not order a Long Island iced tea.  It was like drinking lemonade.  Way too overpriced for the lack of service."}
{"text":"Rat hole. Over priced food coming from ratty Pantless waitresses. I only gave this place one star out of pity."}
{"text":"The food was terrible!! Toby really?!?! Our bartender was awesome and super cute!! I would give her a 5 star!!!!"}
{"text":"Pros:  Macaroni & Cheese balls; Food ok; Clean; Service from our waiter was superb
Cons:  Hostess is not friendly; The chaps on all the ladies are not appealing to the female clientele (at least straight female clientele); The waitress we had the 2nd time we came was nice but not attentive at all; Restaurant design was nice, but very hard to appreciate because it was so dark.

Overall, I WILL be coming back for those macaroni & cheese balls.  They made it more than worth it.  Unless the service really goes to shit, I can see myself returning every time I come to Vegas.  I think they do need to do away with the chaps.  I take the Hooters outfits over these."}
{"text":"Ok, this is what you need to do. Go there when \"Tony Marques\" band is playing, sit at the bar and order yourself a big beer on draft, then order a fried balona sandwich. JJ is a bartender there, she's a doll and very nice. The crowd starts coming in a little later, let's say after 10. I always have a great time when I go. I was just there with my friends in January, 2017. Im definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere. When you are having lunch, dinner or even when just hanging out at the bar area. The waitresses are prompt and friendly and the food is delicious. Portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"Was just okay in my book, we were there before the band started to play. Food to me was just average. The beer was cold that's a plus here in Arizona, service was good just kinda expected a little more I guess."}
{"text":"Burgers were well-crafted and cooked to perfection. The Cap'n Crunch milkshake brought back childhood memories, but was very chunky as a milkshake. They literally added cereal and blended it half-way. If it were a smoother consistency, I would have given this place a 5-start rating."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!  All of Toby's awards around the bar were awesome.  He is a well accomplished country music singer.  The band that was there was great.  It made mine and my boyfriend's visit to Las Vegas even better.  I miss Toby's bar in Tucson, Arizona but will enjoy the one in Las Vegas next time I go."}
{"text":"Playing at the bar, no drinks comped...really?? MLB playoffs in..no sound??? I asked bartender.. Nothing they can do??   All they want is your money. Pretty sad Toby...step it up a little..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a fun upbeat atmosphere but terrible food. The menu is really large and has many heavy fattening choices.

Went with a group of 4 and ordered:

App: Full size beef nachos-- This was actually good and we finished it

Entrees: Fried Bologna Sandwich, Ruben Sandwich, and half of a BBQ Chicken.

The Ruben Sandwich had to be sent back right away. It was had more bread than meat. The meat and coleslaw was totally flavorless. The bread was huge Texas Toast that was soaked in butter. This was replaced with a bowl of Tortilla Soup that was edible but still lacking  flavor.

The Fried Bologna Sandwich was pretty much the same as the Ruben. All butter soaked Texas Toast and a slab of fried bologna with no flavor. We did not send this back, but only half was eaten.

Now on tho the BBQ Chicken plate. Can we say RAW chicken? When the BF ripped into this it was dripping blood. There were some small pieces that were cooked but for the most part it was raw and bloody. They tried to say it was because they smoked their chicken. Listen, I know the difference between smoked chicken ( which is pink) and bloody raw chicken. Totally disgusting and not worth going back. The BF was sick all night and serving raw chicken is dangerous!"}
{"text":"drinks weren't cheap. but, while we were here for march madness, they had $9 \"jars\" of rocky mountain pee water. not too bad. the nachos were good. the bartenders were cool. we came and left just in time for the line dancing to start. 

the place is on some weird floor that is not exactly easily accessible. the escalator was broken and we had to traverse the maze that is Harrahs and find the elevator. but, i'll give them the benefit that had we not be so inebriated, we may have found the place more expeditiously."}
{"text":"First of all....I love Toby Keith, I don't love this bar & grill. My boyfriend got some sort of steak, and I got the Cobb Salad. Paul's steak had been very strongly marinaded, and the flavor completely overwhelmed what would have been a good piece of meat that had been cooked to a good medium-rare. My salad was okay....most of the greens appeared fresh (although I did get to a section of the salad with quite a few pieces of wilted & somewhat slimy greens), there was way too much bleu cheese on it so that was basically all you could taste, and the bacon was not good. I don't know how it's possible to screw up bacon, but they did...and there was a ton of it on the salad. I'm also not sure if this was just a coincidence or what, but I also got sick later that night...not so sure if it was from the food or not.

Our waitress was pretty....and that's about all she had going for her. I understand that since I am a woman, that my opinion is basically invalid on this, BUT I would rather have an ugly waitress (or waiter) who was good at their job than a piece of eye candy who looks good in Daisy Dukes.....but maybe that's just me...."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way home back to Texas. We usually eat at this restaurant during our visits to the casinos in Oklahoma. I found out that the southern style food is not the same and that not all the chain restaurants offer the same menu items. I'm used to good ol' southern fried food and this place just doesn't have that southern change I was missing. I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"I was there on opening weekend and it was a little packed but overall a good experience. Military personnell get in for free and the layout of the area is better than the one in Mesa; however just a lot smaller."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner twice on our trip since it was right in our hotel.  The first time the food and the service were amazing - if based solely on that experience this would've been a 5 star review - but the second time we came in the service was awful and the food was just as bad - so if based on that this would be a 1 star review!

The first trip - the staff were great and always around.  They were quick and everything came out right.  The fried mac & cheese comes out in an amazing beer batter - these were the best I've ever had.  The bbq burger I had was massive and cooked just right.  They have some of the best french fries.  The guest I was with had the chili burger without the bread - good thing there was no way you could pick that up and eat it!  2 burgers,  2 regular drinks and an app for just over $30 not bad at all!

The second trip - it was later in the night and they weren't crazy busy but we waited over 20 minutes even though there were some open tables.  Then we waited quite some time for our waitress.  We gave our order and waited - the mac & cheese was just as good.  The burgers however were bad... I asked for mine medium well (should have been just past pink) - it was like a hockey puck.  My guest asked for hers medium and got one just past medium well.  We couldn't catch our waitress for over 10 minutes after our meals came out at which point there was no way we were waiting for them recook them.  They did make this right and take one of them off our bill... but at this point the dinner was ruined.

They do take off $1-$2 off each item if you have a total rewards card.  This place is extremely loud at night due to the live music and dancing - it is a bar after all so don't expect less.  I have also been in here on crazy nights when bras are hanging from the bar - so I wouldn't recommend bringing kids in here at night!"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars for the entertainment.
The band was great!  Food was just not very good.  The food server was not attentive at all. This is the second time we have been here and we won't be back.  Sorry Toby,
maybe you should actually try the food before you put your name on it!"}
{"text":"As a Toby Keith fan, I was happy to check this place out.  The ladies wear chaps with bare butts, and my uncle said to our waitress, \"I like your pants.\"  She was super nice about it, and she was a great waitress. 

The burgers are pretty pricey - the cheapest was like $16, but the order does come with fries, cole slaw, or potato salad.  We all asked for our burger temperatures to be medium or medium rare, but they all came out well done.  The burgers had good flavors, and we were starving, so we just ate it.  

They only play Toby Keith songs, so be prepared if you are not a Toby Keith fan or a country fan in general.  

While I was there, they did not play his song, I Love This Bar - that would have made my day."}
{"text":"way - way - way better than coyote ugly.  The beers weren't that spendy, which is fine, it's cheap beer (and a welcome change from all the high dollar places) the food was - decent. I'm not a huge fan of BBQ sauce, but could accomodate my food preferences here pretty easily.

Kinda glitzy / tacky vegas like - but then, really where are we? oh yeah, in vegas - go figure. 

I'll prolly stop by here for some wings, and a beer at some time in my future trips, but I don't seek it out.  But if you know a Toby fan, then this is a must stop, and it's not bad, it's just not my thing."}
{"text":"Dined here June 2nd in the evening.  Music and atmosphere was good, but the food was just okay.  I expected a little more, but the band and drinks were a plus."}
{"text":"HORRID.

My best friend and I went on the 4th of July in order to partake in some flag-waving boot-scootin' good times. Instead, we got:

-a 45 minute wait for a table
-a Mom's Apple Cobbler in a plastic cup because the bartender left ice in the martini glass too long and it cracked. Mom's Apple Cobbler, incidentally, is white, creamy, and looks like a bodily fluid manufactured by the half of the population of which I am not a member. Thus, having it be served in a plastic cup made it look like I'd robbed a bank, and not the kind with money
-water in plastic cups, NOT MASON JARS as advertised
-a 30+ minute wait for food after ordering
-soggy fish and chips with no chips
-absent service
-a clientele that summed up my impression of Las Vegas vacationers over the 4th of July: fat, white, and lethargic.

I don't love this bar."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst place of all Caesars properties nationwide!   Staff don't know what's going on, empty tables but a thirty minute wait!  No service at the bar.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, we hit it just about every time we are in Vegas, that's about 5 times a year for the last 5 years or so. Some of the negative reviews are definitely misleading. It's more of a sport bar during the day, so NO; they are not always going to be playing music. The food is good but nothing special either; but no one should go to sports bars or dance clubs for their food only, so why should TKB be rated just based on their food experience.
Overall it's a very cool kickback place, in particular at the night time when the live music is going. We never have experienced any kind of drama and always end up meeting some very cool people there. I minus a star for their pricy food and the fact that not all bands are always that good. Maybe good as musicians, but some are not 100% country bands. Obviously you expect a kick ass COUNTRY band every time you hit the TKB, but sometimes you'll get that Rock/Pop/Country band that not everyone likes."}
{"text":"Sat there forever waiting to be served... Gamed and did not get a single drink comp'd... Bartender had no idea how to make a Patriot Bomb so I explained how and it was still made wrong!!!! The band was over obnoxious....bit ill still give one more chance next time I park at Harrah's ....."}
{"text":"Horrible service, took 15 minutes to even get to order a drink and another 10 to get it. We ordered food and the brought us something we didn't order then when they did get it right forgot the gravy ordered for the fries. The food was bland with no taste over all the experience was one where we will never come back. If I could give them a 1/2 star or no star I would."}
{"text":"Super impressed. Service decent but review is based on food which was great. Shrimp Blt poboy, chicken strips, buffalo chicken wrap, steak all were beyond expectations. Good pick"}
{"text":"My buddy and I went to Grimaldis for lunch and then decided to stop by here for a drink.  We got there around noon and there were only a few people in the joint. The place is pretty freaking big.  Lots of space to roam and mingle.  We sat at the bar and hung out for a bit.  We had a really friendly and easy going (both in personality AND on the eyes) bartender that we chatted up.  She told us that later on that night, it was \"Ladies Night\" and that drinks were 50 cents for ladies and $1.00 for guys during certain hours.  Not bad.  We decided to come back later that night to check it out.  Here is how that went down..............

10:00pm-  We arrived and were semi patted down and paid our $5.00 cover charge.  They slap a wristband on you and then we grabbed a table.  Tons of people were here.  Definitely a younger (college) crowd.  I felt old and kept reminding myself that I was probably a sophomore in high school when most of these spring chickens were born.  Scary thought, I know!  We hung out for a bit and watched some people dance.  About every 20 minutes, the DJ would play some certain song and people would line up and bust out their moves in a group line dance type deal.  They had one song they played (Didn't know the name of it..sorry) where people are just kicking their feet and doing the slide or whatever it was called.  All of a sudden, there is one point in the song where the beat just dropped...PANDAFUCKINGMODIUM!  People started dancing faster and kicking their legs higher and spinning as fast as a tornado etc.  It was NUTS!  My buddy compared it to the Harlem Shake.  Once that beat dropped.......all hell broke loose!  It was definitely a sight to see.  We chilled for about an hour and then decided to bail.

Not sure on why this place gets a 2 star average.  Every person we encountered there was friendly and service was excellent both time frames we went.  I would definitely come back and I think my wife and her girlfriends would enjoy this place too."}
{"text":"Cool bartenders, put on a show when making drinks which is really cool. Lots of high fives and energy, loved it! Drinks kind of pricey but still not enough to keep me away. Great music too!"}
{"text":"We were in the area just doing a little shopping. We went in to have a beer since we live in the area and have never actually gone in. Happy we did. We decided since it was close to dinner to just grab a bite. Menus not big nothing special didn't bother us at all. We got Buffalo Wings and Burgers. Food was very good. We got there around 6-7 not really sure of time. Wasn't very busy. Filled in a little as we stayed. They had a live band we decided to stay and see them. We only stayed for the 1st set unfortunately it wasn't very good. That's the only thing that kept it from 5 stars. Now we did only stay for the 1st set so the night may have gotten better. The music they played before the band went on and after there set was country music which you would expect and we were happy with that. Some of these places try to market as country music bars and play a lot of hip hop and what not. Not this place which we were happy about. We will go back for sure just hope the live music is better since I love seeing live music and seems that this is a great place to see a live band for a bar."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm NOT into Country... Sure, I like a little Shania, a little Taylor Swift, and I know the words to \"Friends in Low Places\" but that's about as far as I go. But when you go to Vegas for someone's birthday, you do what the birthday girl wants. Only fair :)

So like almost every other black person who gets talked into going to a Country bar, I was a little worried about being sidelined by the unfamiliar line dancing and stared down for having a lot of pigment.LOL! But lo and behold, the only line dance for the night was the electric slide! Got that! And there was a United Nations-ish range of diversity throughout the bar. Well, alrighty then! The drinks were ok, and the bar had a lot of seats.... no cover charge or waiting in line either. It's more casual attire than dressy.  Bartenders put on a good show - bottle flipping, stacked shots, free shots, and some kind of simulated fellatio act with a loud alarm for the bachelorette parties. 

Although I had fun with my friends, I was a little disappointed by the overall experience. Call me crazy, but it didn't seem \"country enough.\" I mean, I wasn't expecting hay and cowboys, but the cover band was kid of a let down. They played some country hits, and some rock hits (Come on Eileen, Take on Me, etc) but they weren't that great and then they just started playing a couple hip hop songs to keep people dancing...but, hello, you can't really dance to a cover version of \"California Love\"....um no.

My vote.... look for a legit C&W bar somewhere off the strip - not this commercialized space - or just go back to another swanky Vegas club..."}
{"text":"Food was OK really nothing to write home about, Waitresses were dressed nicely and bar scene was cool."}
{"text":"Horrible. I ordered the nachos to go and sat at the bar to wait. I threw a $20 in the video blackjack machine to waste a little time. I ordered a lemonade for while I waited. The lemonade was really weird. It was mixed with like soda water or something,l... It was oddly carbonated and tasted bad. I took like 3 sips and meh. When I got my food, they not only charged me for the lemonade... Odd enough for someone playing the video machine, but they also charged some bullshit to go fee as well. So I spent like $8 on 3 sips of lemonade and a to go fee. I could see if I was ordering some dine in only special or something of that nature, but I was just getting standard nachos and felt like watching TV and eating in my room. To top things off the nachos weren't even all that good. Avoid this place like the plague"}
{"text":"Inappropriate waitress attire aside, the food was lacking. My dad ordered the chicken fried steak with sweet potato tots and onion rings. A large portion of the steak was inedible due to \"gristle\", the onion rings were overcooked, and tots were mushy. I got the Mac n Cheese Chicken. The Mac n cheese portion wasn't bad but the chicken was very waterlogged and the side slice of bread was simply toasted white bread. Overall, this place was not what I expected. Our waitress was great though."}
{"text":"Steak was exceptionally tough...good flavor but hard to cut...maybe it was the knife.  Shrimp was good though."}
{"text":"I love a good country song but I do not love this bar and grill.  The prices are very high for the portions you get.  Everything I have tried has been bland and overcooked.  The restaurant makes the big mistake made by many similar chains.  It tries to do too much.  There are far too many items on this menu for the staff to be able to get them all right. The real Toby Keith's in OK have smaller menus and better quality.  This is the PBR tourist trap and has almost no character.    Many better choices in town."}
{"text":"Just see Leoat the bar and you'll be well taken care of.  Great live music.  Decent prices and always a lot of fun."}
{"text":"People don't really go here expecting an outstanding dining experience...they go here for the love of country music, USA, pecan pie and patriotism.  The entertainment is fun, but don't expect outstanding culinary skills here.  I ordered rotisserie chicken, which was dry and bland, except for the sauce put on it to cover it up.  A good chicken or BBQ should stand on its own without sauce to hide the quick-fix process.  The green beans were shriveled and the potatoes, while flavorful, we're just scooped from a big mound somewhere.  Could have been better, but could have been worse.  Maybe I'll try a burger next time, but appreciate the restaurant for what it is...a big name joint on the strip in Vegas."}
{"text":"Bar and restaurant named after the hit I Love This Bar.  They host live bands and have a nice dance floor.  Toby has been known to show up for a guest appearance."}
{"text":"Great design and location! We sat at the bar and the service was excellent. That being said we ordered the Toby Keith sampler and every item in it was flavorless. The management understood and offered to replace it... We accepted with the brisket nachos and we just managed through it because we were starving. Would not order it again. 

Service 5 stars., management 5 stars food ZERO stars. Just order a cold one and enjoy the band."}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for this popular spot but I was disappointed. The girls wear interesting outfits that basically show their butts, so I imagine it's mostly popular for the guys. 

I ordered off the happy hour menu for food to save a few bucks on a late lunch. Vegas gets to be a little too pricey for bar food and I personally would rather save for nice dinners. I got the cheeseburger and fries and buffalo chicken tenders so I wasn't expecting to be wowed but I wouldn't even call it good. I hope some of their regular menu items would be better based on their higher price point."}
{"text":"Food was just ok but service was horrible, in an hour span only able to get 1 drink before we left"}
{"text":"Wow, the food here is horrible and the servers are lacking in every way possible. 

First off the food....disgusting, flavorless & underwhelming. I had the BBQ pork sandwich and it literally tasted like dirt, the cfc was bland and the gravy tasted like un -cooked flour. The pickles were actually descent, but the chips and queso tasted like nally's chili, which isn't a compliment. 

The server was clueless on any question we asked. She over charged us on the food and drinks. 

This lace is worthless in my opinion, and I hope it goes away."}
{"text":"I didn't go to Toby Keith's expecting great food or ambiance, but I did hope that his selection of 'country cookin' would be better than average, what with his cowboy hat and all. We were seated quickly (I'll give 'em that), but the service was anemic at best.

The food arrived, and my girlfriend and I sat there munching stoically without comment for a few minutes. We were both hungry, and even though I had several comments, I kept them to myself for that initial interval. Finally, she broke down and said \"Any good?\"

I replied: \"Well, it tastes like the boot, right after Toby Keith pulled it out of Al Qaeda's ass!\" - and then I illustrated my point by taking a sharp bite with my canines and holding it down for ten seconds, and showing her that I hadn't made a dent in the meat!

Toby, a couple of suggestions for you:
1. Leave the jingoistic songs to someone who does *not* own a restaurant, and concentrate on upgrading your food from \"horrible\" to \"barely passable\" - this will be a huge step forward.
2. If you must involve yourself with patriotic activities, please wrap care packages of your food and drop it off between the Afghan/Pakistan border. After two days, I'm positive they'll surrender. Your menu selections will do more damage than the MOAB.

They do take plastic and the monorail will drop you off pretty close, but I'd recommend going elsewhere, even if you're on your last vestige of strength and absolutely must eat. This restaurant has probably lost Toby more fans than his singing ever will."}
{"text":"Thanks to Ronni our waitress..friendly, even brought us take out containers for our drinks and food, as we could only eat half.Delicious Clubhouse,best fries and cornbread I have had in years..huge drinks! we had a hard time finding it in Harrah's! There needs to be better directions and signs to show how to get to it!! Lunch was quiet, needed that!
The ambiance for us Toby fans was great. The hostess who's name eludes me..again very friendly, had just been to the dentist,,so very nice!! The whole environment was Toby Keith charged, we almost felt like he really had a personal hand in the place! The food was very good, large portions and prepared as ordered. The Staff was very friendly ,will return!"}
{"text":"I DONT love this bar and grill. The atmosphere is very impersonal. They call parties that are waiting to be seated over a microphone like you are at a car dealership. So once you are seated, you keep getting jolted by the loud \"party of 4!\" Screams. 
The service was very slow. We were seated before another couple yet, somehow their food arrived before us and they had steak and we didn't. The food was decent, not bad, definitely not worth waiting for and nothing to rave about. Not worth the price of the food or the wait. There are so many other options in vegas to choose from. 
Also, as a side note, my aunt has been to the other TLBG location and said what a disappointment this one is compared to the great food and service at one in California."}
{"text":"A group of us came here around midnight. We had been to a club and were in the mood for something a bit more relaxing and less crowded. This place has the feel of a standard southern dive bar. A nice size dance floor and country songs playing all night. Being from Texas, I am of the biggest country fan but I do love to 2 step so I enjoyed myself. 

There was a pretty sad crowd in the bar, which was off for midnight on a Saturday... Be sure you are going with a group of your own, or else you may be a bit bored.

The icing on the cake is when I got to dance the Cotton Eyed Joe. For those that don't know this song (not the 90s dance version but the real version) it is played at a southern wedding and brought back great memories."}
{"text":"Went in for a weekday lunch on some downtime while at a convention. Have no complaints about the food, not necessarily a grand slam either, but acceptable. (Wings are GREAT). It is Vegas so I'll leave the price at that ($63.00 for two burgers & fries, an appetizer of wings, Pepsi's and tip{$10}) and apparently it's slightly cheaper if you're a member of the players clubs. Service was good could have been a bit quicker, but again it was acceptable our waitress (Kelly) took great care of us. Two disclaimers 1) at least during the day it's 90% country music (I'm from Southern Alabama so this didn't bother me) 2) the waitresses wear tank tops, panties (bikini bottoms) and leather riding chaps; as a parent I possibly would abstain from taking my kids there, however the girls are wearing more clothes than Hooter's girls and we go there as a family and if you have your kids in Vegas they are going to see more than this on the Strip (and you know I have a point)"}
{"text":"Came here last night. Place was kind of empty and the band was ok. Ordered a Vodka Sprite in a mason jar which is like 3 regular drinks in 1 for $22.00. If you plan on hanging out for a while I recommend getting one of those since 1 regular cocktail will cost you between 10-13 dollars. The energy was definitely there by the staff but lacked customers which caused us to leave. Will probably try this place again and possibly update my review."}
{"text":"This place was fun and a cute idea! The ambiance is adorable with classic country music videos playing on the projector and everyone eating good redneck food and havin a good time. The food was really delicious! My friends and I split the Big Boy sampler platter and the Getcha Some fajitas. 

The sampler had a lot of really tasty variety, there were cheesy mozzarella sticks, mac and cheese balls, meatloaf potato skins and saucy chicken wings. So comfy and good! This platter came with a special yummy ranch and gravy, which we were confused about at first, but found that it was to die for with the mac and cheese balls. Perfection!

For a little drinky drink, the Toadsuck Pond is super yummy! Go try it!"}
{"text":"My first time here. I learned to like Country Music here. Food and drinks were reasonably priced. 
I Love This Bar!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my husband and another couple after hearing rave reviews from friends who go to party, rather than eat. (I was pregnant so I thought I could at least check it out for dinner because drinking and dancing would have to wait) I ordered the steak sandwich with no hesitation from our server, she took our menus and that was that. When the food came out I received a ribeye, no bun or toppings. I've been a server, so I wasn't rude I just pointed out I ordered the sandwich. She snapped back, \"we don't have that.\" I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say much of anything, at which she asks \"Do you want some bread?\" Shocked, I said no and she left the table. (I'll get to my husband's nachos in a minute). I went to the hostess stand and got a menu, clearly displaying a steak sandwich. When she came back to the table I pointed out that it did exist and she took my plate back and put the large ribeye on a bun with LTO. Whatever. So back to the nachos. My husband ordered the nachos as his meal. A male server brought them out separate because the platter was so large. He laughed and said I can't believe you ordered this for yourself, no one told you? No, no one mentioned they are obnoxiously enormous and fit for 8 people. Now we aren't children, but like the server who delivered the food...a little guidance would have been appreciated here. This happened back in April I'd say, but I never forgot this experience it was so strange. I love country music and a good time. I thought I'd fall in love with this place but all I can tell you is our server was quite the snob who clearly didn't want to spend her Friday night serving tables."}
{"text":"Made a reservation thru Open Table for 6:00 on a Friday night. Really didn't need a reservation, plenty of room (was busy when we left). Hostess sat us next to the dance floor. I guess it's the \"best spot in the house\" when the dancing and live music starts. 
We ordered the Pulled Pork, She's a Hottie Wrap and Grilled Chicken Wrap. Only complaint on food was the grilled chicken on the wrap was rubbery. The Pulled Pork was delicious. 
***Only thing I would change*** I was seated right next to the garbage can for the wait staff/bussers. I wish they would have side guards on the can so I wouldn't feel and splash of anything coming off of plates or cups. Really kinda gross!"}
{"text":"I return everytime i visit Vegas because drinks are strong & live music is always good! And to say hello to the hottest bartender in Vegas (ok, my favorite) James ~ Amazing eyes and a friendly, attentive bartender thats been there for YEARS! 

Hit or miss on if its busy but love the open dance floor to really country dance!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food was good.  Decent.  I mean, it was typical brewery-type food: burgers, steak, etc.  I thought the waitress uniforms were pretty cheesy, and in general I kind of hate Toby Keith, so maybe that colored my perception of the place.

The food probably warranted a 3 but the service was quite slow and not super friendly, and again...just as irritating as a Toby Keith song ;)"}
{"text":"This place sucks!! I was SO excited for Tobys to FINALLY opened and I gave them credit with all the issues they had opening weekend to give them a break ok new employees learning the ropes of a packed house. 
But even just a week ago when me and 2 of my friends went to HH at 4:30 on a MONDAY service still sucked. There were seriously only 10 other in the entire Huge restaurant. I had to flag down the bartender to get service or refills. They were just standing around talking not paying attention to customers. Even a customer next to me who I didnt know looked at me and mouthed \"Service here sucks\" as they saw I was frustrated again having to flag the bartender down again. 
Also the bartender when asked how certain foods were said he DID NOT recommend them! LMAO!! Who does that!?!? He didnt recommend a couple appetizers. One being the nachos with certain things on it.  I was just like WOW you work for a restaurant and you yourself are giving bad reviews to customer on your food. Not good. Looked really bad on the restaurant. 
I also noticed crowds have gone down and Im not surprised with the bad service. I have yet to talk to someone who has something good about service here. I think they need to hire more then just pretty faces and actual people who know how to serve."}
{"text":"I have to say that after reading the other reviews, I'd have to agree. My husband and I enjoy going to Toby Keith's to listen to the music and have a couple of drinks during happy hour.  We pretty much keep to ourselves and just observe. In the last few times I've been there, I have noticed that one bouncer in particular always seems to be giving male customers lots of attitude.  He's the short and buff and seems to be there all the time.  I've never seen him smile.  He seems to focus on the hispanic males in general and I've seen several of them escorted out for no reason other than having a good time.  I've been wanting to contact someone regarding this for over a month now since it seems to be getting worse. One other thing I'd like to point out is that as soon as it hits around 6:45, all servers and bartenders seem to disappear or preoccupy themselves so you can't order another drink before happy hour ends.  Just thought I'd bring this to your attention since it's been bothering me for awhile.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! More in tune to the sports on the TV then the customers. If you want to watch TV, call in sick! Toby deserves a fun environment, at least pull the customers in, so we don't feel like we are interfering with your relaxing time with your buddies! Was my favorite place in Vegas, super disappointed now....... Just stay home!"}
{"text":"The first time we went 2 years ago we went for dinner. I love that they have Shiner Bock - not a lot of places do.  I had the pulled pork which is my sandwich of choice that I base places on and the BBQ sauce was amazing - I bought a bottle before we left.  My husband had the chicken fried steak and loved it also.  

The second time we went last year, we showed up when they opened at 11am, grabbed a barstool, and left at 5pm.  We had met up with friends of mine from high school that I hadn't seen since high school (16 years!).  The bartenders were awesome for the whole 6 hours, and as much as I loathe domestic brews, the 2 for 1 specials allowed us to have a low tab and be sufficiently drunk.  I love all the free shots when they play the signature song, too!  I still had plenty of Shiner Bocks and a few mixed drinks and a few shots of Jager along with a plate of nachos and we left there with a bill of $45.  I can't wait til the next time we're in Vegas to spend some more time there.

It's very convenient to get to from the monorail, but pretty far back in Harrah's off the strip.  Still worth the effort."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant and bar situated on the Vegas strip. Although it's in one of the smokier casinos around, the restaurant's air quality was good and tolerable. I came here while the National Finals Rodeo was in town and the clientele here couldn't have been more suited for this type of establishment. There were cowboy hats and Lucchese boots everywhere. For starters, a must try are the fried mac 'n' cheese balls. Macaroni and cheese formed into balls, breaded and fried, served with a side of cheese dipping sauce. It's not something found many places but definitely a must try. Otherwise, they offer a good variety of burgers and sandwiches. The fries were great, as was the service - fast and friendly. The only downside to this place is having to walk through one of the older, smokier casinos on the strip to eat here.  If you're staying anywhere on the strip, you're not too far from a great meal here.  A definite must try."}
{"text":"April 28, 2013 Sunday - dinner 7:30 PM
4 adults 

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 4 stars
Service - 3 stars

Background - Been to the Kansas City location a long time ago and enjoyed the meal.

Atmosphere - A bar and restaurant, by the time we finished dinner the band was performing.  

Food
  Appetizer - none. 

  My Main Course - The BBQ Chicken Sandwich was good but put together sloppily.  The chicken was a quarter of the way out of the bun. 

  Dessert - none

Service - No pager system, really! The hostess took our name and asked how many people, 4 clearly as they had no others near the hostess stand.  They finally paged us over the speaker system, Paul party of two.  I went up and talked to a guy, I said I am Paul but a party of 4.  He said \"I was just testing you\", really that tells me you can not take the right number down.  They seated us immediately telling me that they are not managing their tables correctly.  Our waitress was good but had to ask for our player cards back, they should been in the bill folder or given back when associated with the bill.

Future - Maybe if they have a good house band."}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty good.  Tonight, however, the rotisserie chicken was way overcooked and to dry to eat.  Get your food groove back, Toby."}
{"text":"Overpriced and disgusting. The two perfect words to describe this place! If you're coming just to drink or look at the waitresses, this is the place for you. But if you want decent food, please save your time and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Both my husband and I ate here with a group and we both ordered salads with chicken that's tasted like it came from the can. The environment is fun however. You have to be careful ordering drinks, our friends were outrageously priced. The restaurant poured them in a plastic cup and let them take them when we left though since they were so large. If you visit this place, order a burger instead!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I had to check out this place, and try a fried bologna sandwich.  The restaurant's walls are covered with photos and Toby Keith memorabilia.  There are a number of televisions, showing either sports or Toby Keith in concert.  Waitresses are uniformly thin, wear tight leather mini-skirts and short white tops, call everyone \"hon\" and are terminally cheerful.

The food is OK.  The fried bologna sandwich consists of a thick slab of pretty good bologna, lightly fried, with caramelized onions, American cheese, lettuce, and tomato, on Texas garlic bread.  If you like greasy food (like me), it's not bad; if you have a low grease tolerance, stay away!  For dessert, the sweet potato pecan pie with bourbon ice cream was a disappointment.  The combination of the two kinds of pie sounds like a good idea, but neither of the fillings was especially good.  On the other hand, the ice cream was very rich, a big plus.  Cola was served in a large mason jar.  I'm glad I went once, but don't plan to return."}
{"text":"I cant speak for the rest of the food here but I fancy myself quite a wing expert and they were terrible here due to being overcooked. Super overpriced like everything else on the menu, I paid like 14 bucks with tip for a take out order that I wanted to eat in my room because this place is LOUD as shit and definitely for a party crowd. 

Thats all well and good and this place looks awesome as a bar to go check out if you love country music. 

However, its tough to mess up wings and you had better make sure you don't when you charge me $12 for an order. 

Sorry Toby, I know you're not as good as you once were. But I sure hope the rest of your food is better then the wings."}
{"text":"A great country bar. Music not to loud. Food is amazing and the waitress was great. We came just for appetizers. The deep fried pickles and the mac and cheese balls are so good."}
{"text":"This bar would not be my first choice when I visit Phoenix. I met a few girls while having lunch, they talked me into meeting them here later that evening. I don't know much about country music but I have heard of Toby. My first impressions of this bar, did this guy build a bar or a shrine to himself. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of pics of him.

Women get in for free while guys fork over a 5 spot. From what I remember beers were really cheap for the girls and full price for guys. I don't mind paying more than the girls I get why they do it, they want an even distribution of guys to girls. 

There were quite a few bouncers and from what I saw an hour into being their it is needed. As for the girls I met earlier we chilled for a few hours and had fun. 

After my experience at this bar I would visit it again. There was plenty of eye candy and it was nice to get away from some of the narcissistic cali girls I have met at my local bars."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I went to while in Vegas. Rekindled my love of Toby Keith, who was 'Merica before it was cool. Beer came in a 32 oz mason jar. Service was slow, but dang what good drunk food. Mac and cheese bites to die for, and the fries are some of the best I ever had. I know it's mainstream, but I approve!"}
{"text":"Hell yeah!

Stumbled across this little gem after drunkingly exiting the monorail one night last weekend and was quite impressed. Beer served in mason jars, yes! Live cover band that was actually good(and I don't even like country music), yes! Bartenders doing tricks like the bartenders at TGI Friday's used to, yes!

I would definitely go back here. Yeeeeee haaaaw!!!"}
{"text":"Our first night in Vegas we got in late and really had no idea where to eat.  Starving as we walked the strip we found our way into Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill.  The name of this place not withstanding, it didn't seem too bad atmosphere wise.  Our waitress was nice and attentive, and my group of friends all seemed to dig the faux country atmosphere despite being from New Jersey and having no connection to the country at all.   

But yeah, the food, what this review is all about.  Suffice to say I was not impressed.  Looking at the menu I had a slight heart attack.  All the options seemed to be highly unhealthy and likely to send you into a food coma after eating them.  Ok, I understand that this isn't Trader Joe's and can deal with that if the food is good.  I decided to pick what I figured to be the healthiest thing on the menu, the Chicken Caesar wrap.  The rest of my group got Fried Bologna sandwiches and one pasta with Alfredo sauce.  

My Chicken Caesar wrap for lack of a better word, sucked.  The wrap had very little chicken, and was mostly packed with lettuce (no tomato or onions).  This may have been somewhat tolerable if the chicken and lettuce weren't drenched in a watery slop they call Caesar dressing.  When I eat a wrap, I don't want it to leak.  I was really disappointed and so disgusted by the dressing I barely ate it (and I'm not a remotely picky eater).  Everyone else liked their dishes ok, but nobody polished off their plate or was really impressed.  

If you come to this place skip the food- go to Capriotti's earlier in the day and buy a sub to save for dinner.  You'll save time, money, and yourself from a subpar meal."}
{"text":"I hate this Bar.

Cold food right out of the frozen box, then thawed. Gawd awful. 2 (supposed to be fried and hot but served cold) sandwiches, 2 well drinks; $60. Crap quality.

We counted 7 customers total in the place, all sitting near each other, 2 bartenders, full staff on the floor, zero service,, no excuse.

Couldn't get a cocktail re-fill, damn near couldn't get a cocktail to begin with.
Staff never checked how the food was,, couldn't get their attention. Took a long time to get served after we finally got up and walked around and flagged an employee.
Place was empty mind ya,, horrible attitude.

One bartender hacking, wheezing, sniffing, sneezing and blowing his nose with his fingers, then washing the snot off in the glass wash basin,, handling most everyone's else's food and drinks. No employee gave a damn what they were doing. Inhuman.

Filthy bar and dining room. Garbage everywhere.
No comp drinks for video poker. Poker machine quit working and when we finally got an employees attention it was \"Ahhhhh I dunno what to do\",, and we got no help at all.

Expensive and tourist shitty.
Toby Keiths is as bad as it gets in 'Vegas.

4 & 5 star reviews are no doubt from employees, vendors, investors, band members and management."}
{"text":"Well, it was Restaurant Week again, and I finally experienced Toby Keith's vaunted World Famous Fried Bologna Sandwich, with a really thick slab of fried bologna joined with American Cheese and Miracle Whip on grilled Texas Toast.  It was so slippery that the slice of bologna inside one sandwich half slid right out when I tried to raise it to my lips, flew in the air, and skidded to a stop on the floor at my feet.  My waitress graciously got the chef to provide a quick replacement half at no additional charge, along with another long pickle spear.

Speaking of pickles, greasy and juicy battered Fried Pickles were a great appetizer dipped in refreshing pink Ranch Dressing.  Red, white and blue tortilla chips with a tasty mild salsa were good but cold.  Regardless of color, the chips tasted the same.  Visible egg and crunchy celery enhanced a side of potato salad which had a pleasurable tang.  

A half-pound \"American Soldier\" Burger with Cheddar Cheese with Freedom Fries was made perfectly medium rare as ordered.  And a warm Southern Fried Twinkie, accompanied by whole strawberry pieces and sweet whipped cream, was a toothsome treat--much better than an unfried Twinkie.  Service by our scantily clad cowgirl was excellent, and all beverages were served in unconventional mason jar-like containers.

This time 4-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch e very nice server ...
 Sorry I Forgot her name did a really good job ...
Just a little pice of advice if the is a concert Goin on.  ... well is a concert with a restaurant next to ...go figure if you want good time in there plz chose concert or restaurant  you CAN NOT HAVE BOTH...!!!!...
The server sexy females well you see more in the pools .... second visit on the restaurant yeah five stars...."}
{"text":"I took. Good friend for birthday there and it was opening weekend.  She had a blast but I felt so bad bc the service sucked.  I saw a couple of guys order drinks and an incident happened with my husband and one of his friends and they spilled a drink on his shoes.  Not hard feelings they were talking and apologizing and the guy who was paying was turned for less than a min and the chick bartender tossed his money at him on the counter and walked off.  Keep in mind I was sober (dd). Will meet go there again."}
{"text":"The food is good, as well as the bands. But sometimes the servers are lost in wonderland. Last time it took over 30 minutes to get a burger."}
{"text":"One of my fav bbq places and they really do have great stuff to choose from I only been three times but planning on making my way back again to enjoy this fine quality food"}
{"text":"I'm kinda bummed out by this place. Took forever to be seated (there was only 3 of us) and way over priced. Also the food was nothing special I got the american soldier burger and it hardly had any taste to it. Atmosphere was great and our server was very nice. Go to another burger joint."}
{"text":"I had the old west burger with out the bun and it was amazing. The BBQ sauce is so good and the fried onions were a good addition! Plus bacon? Who could go wrong with bacon? Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Met up with my friends who were staying in Harrah's. 

Immediately was served a pour of a fruity mixed drink by one of the bartenders roaming around the top of the bar. 

Then my friends proceeded to get me drunk by ordering a shot of vodka, which was HALF of one of those plastic cups. Literally, was enough for me. 

However, bartenders were either \"busy\" with the \"regulars\" or the others where their names were known, but did not pay attention much to us three. They did end up giving us a \"girly\" drink with whipped cream and gave us a laugh or two toward the end of the night."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! I LOVE THIS BAR!!!! Bologna sandwich on Texas toast with American cheese and grilled onions!!! are you kidding me?!!!! DELICIOUSO!!!!! super cute bartenders too!  country and rock music while you dine?!!! what more could a girl ask for?!!!! word on the street is they have line dancing in the evenings. i cant wait to part take on that action!!!! its now on my must-do list when i go to Vega$ as well as the water show at the Belllagio. the water show is the best part of Vega$$$$$$"}
{"text":"Definitely didn't love this bar. My boyfriend and I went there for lunch. Location was great in the Harrah's casino, but that's honestly the only thing that I can say was great. The waitress was friendly, and recommended a few items from the menu. I ordered her #1 choice of a fried bologna sandwich with french fries. The sandwich was completely saturated in grease. It's a grilled sandwich so I expected it to have some grease, but this was absurd. I ate about three bites. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips and it, too was covered in so much grease it was not edible. Needless to say we paid a hefty price for heartburn and stomach aches for the rest of the day. We will not be returning. If I had to recommend one thing, it would be to save your money and eat at the deli in Harrah's."}
{"text":"I've always had an awesome time here everyone is so friendly. I go on Thursdays or Fridays for the dancing(: definitely recommend coming here especially if you want a good time!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is packed.  Love the beer in Mason jars, and the live country music.  But  a very super random crowd.  (To the fat girl in assless chaps, uh, no).  

No cover, hard to find upstairs in a cheap hotel past an escalator."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in the food! Honestly, it made me sad. Had the Chicken Fried Steak. Neither it nor the gravy had any flavor. The Freedom Fries and Sweet Tea were amazing though. Sent it back but told the waitress I wanted to keep the fries. She said she'd being me fresh ones so I said of course, no biggie. Ordered the Chicken Tenders. Again, no flavor so I stuck with the fries and called it a night. When the check came, I was charged extra for the fries... Won't come back again."}
{"text":"This place sucks. No one here and service is still slow food came out cold and has taken ten min to get the check. The menu is over priced for what the give you. Service is sub par. The place is nice and clean better to go for a drink   I will pass and not come back"}
{"text":"Nothing to not love about Toby Keith's. 

From the succulent rib/ wing combo to the sweet peach cocktail, I had a wonderful dinner experience here with a group of 12. Our server was unbelievably friendly, and was patient as we took time to altogether decide what we wanted. Drinks and food came out promptly, and everything just amazed me.

My rib/ wing combo consisted of two flavors of each meat, and both meats were just beautifully tender and flavorful. My mouth is watering as I reminisce. The mashed potato side was also wonderful, and the fries put me over the moon. 
Meanwhile, mixed drinks came in 32-oz. mason jars. My Georgia peach one was great--not too sweet, not too strong, a perfect mix that lasted each of us a long while. 

I wish there were a better way to convey my adoration for TK's. But in short, it's definitely worth a try: the meat is delicious, the drinks are fantastic, the people are great."}
{"text":"Great super fast service. Nothing fancy just good music, sports game on, good steak food.  Friendly staff. We will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Food was great especially the fries and wings!
They were late delivering one couples meal but food was mmmmm
Food coma kicking in"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to find a cowboy.  I was at a point where I'd agree to pretty much anything.

We go to this bar, and it was a bit early (barwise) I guess (10:45?  11?) and it was just crowded enough.  There was some line-dancing, some country songs, some non-country songs, a live cover band which had a BEAUTIFUL lead singer... and then a Toby Keith impersonator and a Willie Nelson impersonator.  Though we may have been unsober enough to be rather certain for some period of time that they were REALLY Toby Keith and Willie Nelson.  

So I definitely had a pretty fantastic time.  There were a few moments with sketchy men, which might be one reason I'm not throwing 5 stars out.  They also don't have a bathroom in the restaurant, so you have to go back into Harrah's, and they wouldn't stamp my hand when I left to go (we got there before the hand stamping started) so it was possible if it got crowded I couldn't get back in (luckily I did, but the uncertainty didn't make me happy).  Also, 6 dollars for a Bud Light makes me a sad panda, even though I know it's Vegas.  I don't even know why I ordered a Bud Light- I don't even LIKE Bud Light.  

However, the drinks were totally served in mason jars when I was there, and a bartender poured shots down people's throats for free at some point.  That was pretty fun.  The crowd was also REALLY into the music, which added a lot.  However, there could have been more single cowboys (for my friend, of course...)."}
{"text":"interesting! 

Such an interesting experience. Went on ladies night the guy-girl ration was about 3-1. Men were definitely on the prowl--- which makes it awkward when you are very obliviously not looking. 

Didn't try the food, but did try quite a few variety of drinks and they were all fantastic! I'd recommend going before 9 to find a comfortable spot it gets pretty busy afterwards. I like how like most bars this is also a restaurant so there are a lot of seats available not just a small space and dance floor.  The staff upfront, seemed more invested in their own conversations between each other then helping the guests. However, the bartenders and waitress we had were both excellent, checking up on us often and refilling our waters. Overall it was a fun experience, just wish the initial staff you meet at the door were more friendly, after all they are the first impression of the bar-- and it wasn't a good one. So for that had to give 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"Wanted a burger with my cousin and she's like Toby Keith so we ended up here. We started with the wings that were huge. Each had the wing and drum, and they were tasty. The buffalo sauce and the bbq were both fantastic. My cousin got the Rueben that left my mouth watering and I had the pulled pork. I added extra BBQ and it worked. The coleslaw and potato salad were just ok; the kind you'd get locally at the deli. 

The waitresses either wore tight cutoffs or chaps with no pants. They had one underwear/bathing suit material on the bottoms, and obvious people tend to like that. Overall not a bad place but sort of loud as they played Keith's music the entire time. 

Lots of TVs at the bar if you want to drink and catch a game though."}
{"text":"I went there on a date and got there before the live band on a Saturday night. We waited for a table to clear and as soon as one did we grabbed it. A waitress comes and tells us that we couldn't sit there because that was someone else's table and it shouldn't have been bused. She acted like we stole the table but actually the busboy cleared it. So we moved to the bar and after spending over $80 on drinks and appetizers the big bouncer came and told us we had to move again. Why? so the \"girls could dance on the bar\" Really! Well why did they have bar stools there. I gave them the finger, left and said I would never go back. It is not at all like TK's song..."}
{"text":"I don't have any complaints, didn't eat but my red beer was good. Love the country music and environment."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places, I really enjoyed the atmosphere here as well as the friendly staff, and the chicken wings are very tasty as well I can't wait to go back again"}
