{"text":"Clearly some people have not been out of the United States and don't know anything about Mexican food. There is an excellent place for them called Chipotle. The food at Mi Pueblo is the most authentic Mexican food in Cleveland. If I had to complain, I would say that sometimes their Guacamole has way too many huge pieces of onion in it, clearly for filler. I also wish that they had pozole on the menu, even as a special. Other than that, God bless them for having al pastor."}
{"text":"this place is filthy the mens room stinks of urine and had no paper towels  after i washed my hands. when i brought this to the attention of my server she told me to come back tomorrow to see that it has been cleaned. no apology!!!!  this isnt the first time i have been disgusted with there bathroom facility but it will be the last as i will not go back."}
{"text":"Had breakfast last weekend, service was good for the plane been packed. The green chilaquiles were really good had a good crunch not soggy. I would eat them again."}
{"text":"I had a shrimp burrito and it was very tasty. I loved the garlic cheese stuff they put on top and my friend loved his red chilli burrito. Staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere, seems authentic as the abuelitas and tias were cooking in the back. Started off with the house tortilla chips ( stale) and salsa, followed by the chicken soup which was just ok.  Ordered the carnitas, chicken fajitas, and michelada. Carnitas were in a tomato based sauce, which was different from the usual fare ( fried and pulled) ...chicken fajitas were a little bland...michelada was good and on par to comparable restaurants. Overall would recommend if you had no other Mexican restaurant to go to and were in the area...otherwise, you probably won't be missing out if you went elsewhere"}
{"text":"Food is aight. I love their chips and salsa they give you before you order. Seems like they need to get their stuff together around dinner time because they take fooooooorever to take an order, serve, and bring more chips salsa, which have all been eaten from waiting on the food to get there."}
{"text":"Este lugar es el mejor des que comí la primera vez ase 11 años no dejo de venir , lo recomiendo. Aquí las meseras , son muy amables , y bien atentas el mejor servicio y la comida ni se diga la mejor."}
{"text":"A lady recommened this place for my husband and I to try. We did not care for it at all. The chimichanga was okay but I don't like the fact that they put dark meat and white meat together. I don't care for the taste and texture of dark meat so it turned me off. The rice was okay as were the beans. They served a small bowl of beans with chorizo and salsa with chips which I really enjoyed. The service was really great but I just did not care for the food. Very nice family atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you are going to strain a bottle of liquor to get whatever particles or creatures (two dead ants were found on our table upon being seated and fruit flies were buzzing around everywhere) at least do it out of the customers view!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the price was great! If you love good Mexican food I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food me and my wife love this place!! Chilaquiles very good ! I love tha chicken fajitas!! I recommend this place to everyone it's really good very good flavor! And for people to post negative reviews because of the price stop being cheap go to Taco Bell if you can't afford good Mexican food !!"}
{"text":"The food here is as authentic to Mexico as can be! The ambiance is busy,food is beyond spectacular, waiting for the food wasn't even that long at all. Great place to meet up for lunch.."}
{"text":"The food is GREAT but the service is EXTREMELY slow. I suggest calling to order food at least half an hour prior to coming in to ensure you don't die of hunger while waiting for the food. We've dined here a few times but it's the same issue of waiting so long for the food. The last time we visited, we waited for almost an hour for our food and we weren't given much attention to by the servers. I would go here everyday for their delicious food but I'm always deterred by the slow service."}
{"text":"Beware!! I ate here one night and was in the hospital the next day with salmonella poisoning!"}
{"text":"So good! Actual great authentic Mexican food and not the commercial stuff from most places. Excellent and delicious! We go every weekend!"}
{"text":"There are few times you are suprised by mexican food in phoenix. There are so many. This pace really lifted the bar. This is a new favorite. Definitely worth a try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"My son and I went yesterday for the first time. The place was nice and quiet. Some Mexican 80s music playing. Very clean place and our food was delicious. My son had a chimichanga with side of rice and I had the shredded beef burrito with rice. Their salsa bar was good and fresh. I'll recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"It's close to my work and they have a half-price margarita day, so I've been there a half dozen times.  There are three great things about this place. The service is always friendly; and the pickled carrots and chicken soup are awesome.  However, every entree I've ordered has been really bland, over fried or both. And those margaritas are really too sweet. Doesn't hold a candle to Cozumel in Valley View."}
{"text":"I work in the area and we order Mi Pueblo at least once a week. I always get the shrimp tacos. They are so good! The tartar sause it comes with is so awesome. Great portions also. I've had the ceviche which surprisingly tasted like my mom makes and I've never trusted a place with making ceviche but this one is great! Another favorite around here is the Mi Pueblo Chicken salad. It's simple but the avocado dressing is mouth watering good. Their fresh chunky salsa is my favorite. Always fresh with just a little kick to it. The spicy green salsa is also very good but caution because it can be SPICY! The chips that come with for dipping are also delicious. Rice are great, black beans great, refried beans great, carne asada great also. Have not tried the enchilada style though. There's not one down side that I can think of and recommend this place to anyone. Wish I could try everything on the menu but it's hard to steer away from the Shrimp Tacos because they are the best I've had anywhere"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Mexican food. We lived in Phoenix for nearly 9 years and this was our go-to spot to bring visitors. Great prices, outstanding food, quick and polite service. This place has it all. We are in town visiting as I write this and we had to make a stop. The chicken flautas were as good as I remember and the six halves? Mouthwatering."}
{"text":"Always good food & service here with a balance diet shrimp tacos with the green guacamole salad dressing. Including chips salsa and bean dip."}
{"text":"Best pupusas I've ever had had. Hands down. The pupusas are made to perfection, perfect ratio of masa to pork and cheese. The restaurant itself has also undergone renovations so it's much nicer than it was before. This is my go-to place. I highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Best pupusas I've had!!   LOCATION It isn't the best location but hey, if that's what keeps the food cost down, right? It's in a plaza with a Dollar Tree store. Theres lots of free parking unlike some places in Milvan.   CUTLERY  They've upgraded them. I was given metal fork and a metal knife.   INTERIOR I've been to this place before but they seem to have recently renovated. It represents more of the \"Pueblo\" look. From the windows to the interior, everything has been flipped around for a better Restaurant feel. There are lots of beautiful paintings and I believe there's a sports bar in the basement that's soon to open.  SERVICE  The workers there are really nice. It took about 5 minutes to get the Tamal De Pollo (Chicken tamal) and 10 minutes or so for the Pupusas because they were being freshly made.   FOOD Absolutely best pupusas I've had in Toronto and I've been to different places. I always get Revueltas and they were amazing! You can taste the chicharron, cheese and beans. The masa had a slight crispiness to it that I love. The Tamal was good too but it was a bit too soft for my taste. It had more masa than chicken stuffing but it's OK. The horchata is A MUST! I was very impressed. I'm not sure if they improved the recipe but it was heavenly.   I'd definitely go back"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for two pupusas and 40 minutes for ceviche and yuca con chicharon, the yuca and chicharon was probably fried with old oil.  I finished my meal before my wife got her seviche with yuca and chicharon. Never going back."}
{"text":"The BEST veggie quesadilla I've had in a long time!  Great food, Great Service!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos here. It's difficult to find restaurants that make their own taco shells. This place does and they are good- crunchy, but not too oily. Iced cold beer. Good prices as well. My new favorite taco place."}
{"text":"Loved the salsa.  The guacamole was amazing.  I ordered the creamy chicken enchiladas, my husband got a mariscos meal, daughter got the beef soft taco and we all loved them.  The margaritas were also tasted and the churros with ice cream was also outstanding.  Great place."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Casual dining fresh food. Friendly wait staff. Authentic food. Exec bean dip chips and fresh salsa."}
{"text":"We've been searching for Dominican food in Toronto and finally found it at Mi Pueblo! We visited yesterday and had Desayuno Dominicano (Dominican breakfast) which includes 2 eggs cooked to your liking, fried salami, fried cheese and MANGU! It was so delicious especially the Mangu was amazing!!! We also ordered Empanadas Colombianas which had plantain inside it, was also very good. We ordered coffee to drink and their coffee came in these huge mugs and it was good coffee! We will definitely be coming back to try different things on the menu. Our server Nicole was very friendly and helpful! Nos vemos pronto! :)"}
{"text":"This is an outstanding Mexican restaurant!  Guacamole was very good as was the salsa and bean dip.  Carnita's were moist with lots of green peppers and sautéed onions.  Well worth searching out this gem."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing this restaurant for many years. We went for dinner this past Friday night, it was my friends first time, she was totally impressed with the ambience, the excellent service and great tasting food. I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Service is always great and I just tried their vegetarian ommelette, the tomatillo sauce is wonderfu! So tasty!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  We decided to ignore the reviews and check out Mi Pueblo for ourselves. The food was good, we loved the guy walking from table to table playing guitar and singing and the price was right! It was a great date-night place and we look forward to going again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times I was heartily disappointed. The food was generally bland, the service mediocre, and my boyfriends burrito had bones in it.  It is well known on the Case Western Campus that Mi Pueblo only really exists due to it's bar, and from every sample of food I've had from there, I believe it.  I'm pretty sure I'd only brave another taste after one of those margarita pitchers."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. Casual and quick, the salsa bar is great. Food is good, not super heavy, and large portions. The location is a bit sketchy being over at the Metrocenter, but worth the risk of getting mugged for this tasty mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Pros: Friendly, attentive service. Some parking available. Kitsch Mexican decor.  Cons: Battling music from the too-loud bar Latino-rap jukebox and the dining room traditional Latino music. VERY STALE tortilla chips (we asked for a new basket of chips because they were incredibly stale, but the second basket was just more of the same--we gave up.) The salsa and tomatilla dips, while seeming to be homemade, were both extremely bland and left us just wanting the real thing.  My burrito was mediocre at best, and served with dry rice and dry refried beans. My fiance's enchiladas were terrible.The tortillas on the enchiladas were also stale and covered in an extremely bland red sauce. It was served with the same dry rice and beans combo. The margarita we ordered (lime, on the rocks with salt) was undrinkable. I've never had an more disgusting margarita-- and that says a lot. It tasted like water and that green (too sweet) margarita mix usually used in such establishments. I don't believe there was any tequila in it AT ALL.  Also, our bill came to over $40 for 2 entrees and 1 disgusting margarita (which we left full on the table). I'm definitely down to pay for good food, but paying this much for that meal was difficult to swallow.  Please do not go here expecting good Mexican food or margaritas... You will be sorely disappointed. I hope this helps you avoid our mistake!"}
{"text":"We have heard great things from friends so we decided to give it a try. The Margaritas were just the right strength.   The food was good. I had the grilled chicken salad burrito.   I would love to rate this higher but the restaurant was fairly empty and yet the dining room was not bussed. The salsa bar was closed."}
{"text":"Both the food and service were very good.  The salsa was very good, but they could have given a larger bowl of it or refilled it without us having to ask. Other than that, a very nice meal."}
{"text":"I love the food and enjoy dining here.  The staff is always friendly and professional.  I always tip greater than 20% because the food is always well prepared, the staff is professional and attentive, and I support local business.  The only negative  is that they do not provide a \"salad plate\" to diners to eat their chips and salsa off of."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, I use to eat here at least once a week when I lived by the Metro Center Mall, but since I've moved out of town, I don't get the chance. I miss the food so much, and the people that work there were great too, were always very nice a prompt with my food...wish I could find another place like this were I live now..."}
{"text":"Absolutely everything you could want.  Great food.  Salsa bar.  Fast and friendly service.  Inexpensive and delicious house margarita, with a view of the mountains from the outdoor patio.  Give it a try.  It doesn't look like much, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"MI Pueblo has been a standard lunch stop during the week.  The prices are on point and the food is served hot and fast. The salsa bar is very good.  The only complaint I could ever come up with would be that the food comes out so fast that you hardly have time to get your drink, chips and salsa. Still its made to order and is hot.  Great lunch for the price."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Their chorizo, beans, and Mexican potato platter is amazing and is a great hangover cure. The staff is always nice and the restaurant is always clean. Our favorite weekend spot! :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here with family for 5 yrs now and the food is always consistent. I consider myself an outstanding cook with pretty good judgement. This place has by far the best steak and chicken fajitas I have ever tasted outside of my kitchen. I do not care for their margaritas they are too sweet for me."}
{"text":"Do not like.  The food is bad. I've never had anything here that has particularly had any flavor. Not to mention the prices are pretty high for using tasteless ingredients.    I recently went for half price margarita night with a couple friends.  We got strawberry flavored (I don't particularly like that flavor anyways) and it was totally Kool-Aid, barely a drop of tequila, if any.    I used to actually praise their salsa, but that's even gone downhill.   The only reason it gets a star is that I had a good time with friends, but really, Mi Pueblo was simply the host--not worth it when I have an apartment right around the corner, with better salsa and tequila."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this place our first night in Phoenix after watching the Dodgers beat the Rangers (Go Blue!) at Spring Training.  It was convenient to our hotel, and we chose to go there after reading reviews on Yelp.  We were not disappointed.  The food was good Mexican (a little more traditional than \"fresh Mex\") and quite reasonably priced.  I had the Mi Pueblo Enchiladas plate: one chicken, one beef, and one cheese enchilada.  The beef and chicken enchiladas were excellent, the cheese enchilada didn't appeal to me as much.  My partner had an enchilada, carne asada dish which was also very tasty.  We had good Margaritas.  There is table service although the space is set up for counter service -- I'm guessing they don't have table service at lunch?  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch and he told us lunch is a good time to come because prices are much higher for dinner and on weekends, go figure.  Prices were ok considering you get refried beans, rice and endless chips and salsa.  I could have simply had those for lunch, but more on those later.  I ordered the chicken soft tacos and including the above I also got 2 tacos, so a pretty good size lunch for me.  The tacos had plenty of tasty chicken in them and the refried beans didn't have a great feel or taste to them. The rice was a bit tasteless but then again I'm not a rice fan.  Now for the unlimited chips and salsa bar...the chips come out fresh frequently and the salsa is replenished in a timely manner. They have 3 degrees of hotness but I only ate the mid range. Great taste with just the right amount of spice. And did I mention it's unlimited!? Yea, this could have been my lunch for sure with maybe a side a refried beans!  You order at the counter then they bring your food to you. Drinks are self serve with soda and tea for options. I saw someone with a margarita so I guess they serve alcohol too.  It's in a strip mall so parking is ample.   It wasn't very busy at lunchtime so getting a table was easy.  Wouldn't mind coming again but will probably stick with lunch for the pricing (if this is incorrect I'd love to hear from management)."}
{"text":"This little place is Amazing! My family and I  have been coming here for the past 3 years. Every-time is even better than the last. I always get the same thing. Camarones agua chile. The prices are super reasonable. My family and I really enjoy this place over any other Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"We frequent this spot quite a bit. My husband is a fan of their seafood while I enjoy the many other offerings. Service is great and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered for a company lunch from Mi Pueblo today.  They do not normally deliver, but they were able to accommodate my request.  Not only were they on-time, but every order was correct and the food was delicious!  Thank you, Mi Pueblo, I will definitely order from you again for our company events."}
{"text":"Always great customer service, and delicious food. Prices are a bit outrageous now though so I don't visit as often at all."}
{"text":"I love Mi Pueblo on the West Side, but I was completely disgusted by Mi Pueblo at University Cirlce. It was dirty and I didn't even want to eat my food."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING & their margaritas are perfect!!! The waitress we got was a bit stuck up but other than that, good experience!"}
{"text":"Thank God Mi Pueblo 7th St. is near my home.  So nice to have such a great place right down the street.  Clean, great food, family run and has been consistent with their food and service since they arrived. Only been to the one at Metro once and it was just as good an experience, just with more room."}
{"text":"this place is the shit. if you want good Mexican without paying too much, come here. my girlfriend and I love it here, been coming for awhile. great hang over food. don't go to federicos and get e. coli, come here."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with a large party and ordered two pitchers of margaritas and there was literally no tequila in them."}
{"text":"We met up Friday night for a richly-deserved  family dinner of margaritas and enchiladas.  The weather was lovely so we sat outside to munch on chips and bean dip.  Our waitress was nice but missed an opportunity to recommend their specialty dishes.  I asked her to make recommendations on drinks and entrees, especially since this was the first time for most of us.  Having read some of the other reviews, I see some intriguing options that we missed earlier.    My brother suggested this place because it has an array of vegetarian options and is reasonably priced.  We all ordered our faves: nachos, spinach enchiladas, chimichangas, chili rellenos, and cheese enchiladas.    I had my usual enchiladas with red sauce, which were accompanied by rice.  The red sauce was ultra-mild and lacking in spice which means I am still looking for the perfect blend of heat and flavor.  This sauce may have to be doctored up to fit the bill.  The bean dip was heavenly though.  All in all, it was a good meal with good service, great weather, and delightful company.   The check for 5 people was 68 dollars; it was reasonable for the amount of food we received.  This place is not big on ambience but was just fine for a family dinner and end-of-week decompression."}
{"text":"Great meal and service in a strip mall.   The shrimp tacos were amazing and the side salad was different but delicious!  My husband enjoyed the chile relleno.  Nice little bar with many options for margaritas."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for three weeks on a business trip and luckily found this spot on my 3rd day in town.  I ended up eating here 7 times in 21 days.  I brought my coworkers here, and they all ended up eating here at least 2-3 times.  It's just that good.  So how good is it?  Lets just say that their tortilla soup was the only thing that could cure my horrible hangover after a long night in Scottsdale!  I've eaten the fish tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, nachos, and tortilla soup.  All were exceptional!  They also bring out chips with salsa, as well as beans, which was a nice touch.  The dining area is fairly small, but they do have an outside dining area as well.  The wait staff is very friendly, and they will get you drinks as soon as you sit down, which is something that more restaurants should do!  The food comes out very quickly, and they do have 2 TVs, one on either side of the dining room, which are usually tuned to a sporting event.  I've been out of Phoenix for 3 months now and I miss Mi Pueblo!  I'll definitely be going back the next time that I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My coworker recommended this place and I am sure glad that she did. Friendly atmosphere that welcomes everyone. The food is delicious and I am upset that I didn't take a picture before finishing it. It was so good that I couldn't find myself to stop to take a picture. I highly recommend Mi Pueblo to everyone! Try the #10!"}
{"text":"Mi Pueblo has the most wonderful food!  We had only been eating either lunch or dinner here for a while.  Then we tried their breakfast one Sunday morning and OMG!!!  They have a great breakfast!  You get chips, salsa & bean dip too.  The prices are reasonable and the staff is so friendly.  LOVE this place!!  We've been coming here for Sunday breakfast for several months now."}
{"text":"Excellent! This is now our go-to Mexican food restaurant. Every meal includes awesome chips and salsa. Edit: Dinner comes with chips, salsa and beans (which are excellent). Portions are plentiful, prices are right, the place is clean, the service is great, and the food is great as well! Not generic Mexican food, there's always an added special touch that makes the dish more than your typical fare."}
{"text":"I agree with Amy T.  Discusting. The very opposite of the Mi Pueblo on Lorain.  The food at this one was flavorless and dishes appeared to be dirty."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch & dinner but recently learned they are open for breakfast.   They have several Mexican & American options to choose from. Reasonably priced with pleasant service.   Try them out. Exceptionally yummy!"}
{"text":"Flan is a win. One time the bartender let us take our drinks to go. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"I forgot about this little gem until recently.  Mi Pueblo is next door to Peter Piper Pizza at Ghetrocenter.  I've been here many times.  The breakfast is excellent, as are the micheladas, shrimp cocktails, chile rellenos, beans, salsa, pretty much everything.  The price is also very good for the fare.  You can eat like a king and still have a lot of money left over for other pleasures.  The service has also always been great.  They take good care of you and you can even see the cooks doing their thing.  The ambiance is a little lack luster.  Its clean and all but let's be real here metro should be bulldozed to the ground at this point and redone.    If you are nearby and looking for a good place to eat Mi Pueblo is probably your best bet!"}
{"text":"I lived about 5 minutes away from this place throughout my four years of college. Really, it's only known for cheap drinks, especially for half-price margarita Wednesday. You'll find the place PACKED with college students, so don't plan on coming on that day for food.  The chips and salsa are good, but way way way too watery. You can't even scoop anything up with a chip. I've had some of the food, such as the avocado burrito, enchiladas and chile relleno. Really, it was last resort food when I couldn't get any other decent Mexican. They load the entrees up with either way too much cheese or oil, usually both. It's good drunk food, but go somewhere cheaper if you can. It's kind expensive for the price. Bathrooms are disgusting. You're better off holding it.  I've heard the one across town is much better on food. I might go try that soon. This location holds a near and dear place in my heart though. Not for the food, mind you, but for the college experience. At one point I came here so often that the amazing servers would always give me free tequila shots. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Our server was clueless,  didn't know the menu or drinks it was awkward.  The food was delicious though I had ordered the carnitas plate which was really great except for the fact that the carnitas were extremely greasy.  I will try this place again"}
{"text":"This is a good place for overly sweet, half price margaritas on Wednesdays, period.  The bartender was friendly and fast and did a round of shots with us.    I wouldn't come here for much else though.  The salsa they offer is good, but it's not enough to carry their food.  It would be good drunk/munchy food if you are trashed.  I got their carne asada taquitos appetizer, which was okay.  The carne asada was flavorful, but it was missing something- a hint of lime, perhaps?  I got 4 mini taquitos for 8.00, it was expensive for the amount of food we got.    The service is a bit slow though.  I had to go and ask the waitresses for more water/soda/drinks and salsa.    Additionally, the cleanliness of the restaurant worries me.  The bathrooms were both out of order, emitting a foul odor.  I was too afraid to order anything else after seeing the condition of the restaurant.  I saw a ceiling tile fall onto an empty table, leaving a billowing cloud of dust and ceiling debris.    I have never been to their west side location, but from the reviews maybe I should go to that one instead!"}
{"text":"I have had their grilled chicken salad. Def a fan! Whatever salad dressing is on the bottom is AMAZING! My coworkers said this is some of the most authentic Mexican cuisine I will have. Have not tried anything else on the menu yet, but looking forward to some huevos rancheros"}
{"text":"Mi Pueblo holds a sitio especial en mi corazón. I have never been to the other location but will review my evening at this locale tonight. I've been going there since 2003, when I was in college. I swear by the carne asada burrito for $5.50-although my Chipotle loving brother and I respectfully disagree, this is the best burrito I've had in town. Insider tip-don't order the burrito dinner-instead order the burrito solamente (only the burrito) because it's way cheaper-and you don't need the subpar Mexican rice and salad alongside it. I also enjoy their margaritas-I love the raspberry one (had 2 on the rocks tonight). I accidentally forgot my purse and the waitress carded me-however, the owner recognized me and told her to forget it LOL so I was happy-considering I blow enough money there. The prices are a bit steep but I think they have a cheaper lunch menu and for certain 1/2 price margaritas on Wednesdays from 11am-9pm. Give it a try-it's better than puke-doba further down on Euclid. P.S. Speaking some Spanish always helps!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch.  Nice servers, decent service  Food - meh.  I've had better just about anywhere else.  Don't waste your calories.   Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We just found our New Mexican joint!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place been coming here for about 10 years. It's about an hour away, but when ever I'm in the west valley, i will make a special trip. Always good quality, and usually pretty fast. Always get A steak burrito and the wife shrimp chimi."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to go for Mexican food. The salsa bar is great (but its not always open) and chips are great too. Fast friendly service, good prices, and food is delicious! It may be a bit Americanized, but overall very good. I would prefer the place over the famous TeePee."}
{"text":"Stopped in early Friday evening. The place as soon as I walked in seemed really clean and inviting. I got a little confused because they had a menu over the registers, so I thought it was like baja fresh where you order your food at the registers. My husband and I were drawn to walking right up to the counter when a waitress quickly walked up to us carrying menus and led us to a table to sit down, so I felt a little awkward.   The atmosphere was open and bright with all sorts of different clientele. We sat down and right away ordered two margarita's on the rocks. Shortly after a basket of chips and sides of salsa and warm beans were delivered to our table. Our margaritas were pretty good. I ordered the house Margarita instead of the top shelf brand. But the tequila was pretty good tasting. It wasn't a hit you in the face type of drink, but had very good flavor.   Menu's were given to us and we started looking at all the selection. Pretty nice mixture of fajitas, fish, meat, and poultry. I finally decided on ordering the carne asada cheese enchilada plate. We didn't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered. The portion size was pretty big for the prices, seems like the prices were around $8-$16 a plate. I looked around the restaurant and noticed a salsa bar, so I got up to get some and boo, all the salsa was gone. It was a empty bar. So I was kinda getting the picture of how maybe lunch is done??.. Walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only. So I was a little disappointed at this point. I walked up to our waitress and asked for additional salsa, and she brought over the mild chunky salsa that was served with the chips earlier.   Our food was served, and I started carving into my meat and noticed it was very tough. I popped it into my mouth and it was as I thought very chewy. I did eat about half of it before I was done with it. The meat wasn't as favored as I like mine. I took a bite of my cheese enchilada and it was OK, I mean it really didn't have any flavor to it, and I couldn't taste any sauce at all on it. The plate had a huge helping of rice which I didn't get into, not all that impressed with fillers like that overwhelming my plate. I can say this I did feel stuffed by half the meal.   We had a 1/2 off coupon, buy one meal get one free, but honestly even with getting those coupons in the mail every week, I probably won't be back. It wasn't horrible tasting food, just bland for what I prefer."}
{"text":"Out of state- party of 20~ first time customer Great & fast service! orders were correct ~awesome mexican food! would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food restaurant ever! Went there recently and the service, atmosphere and food was amazing.  I'm from California and thought I wouldn't find anything good in Phoenix,  Mi Pueblo is that spot!!!"}
{"text":"Best (casual) Mexican Restaurant in the Valley.  Here are the highlights: 1. Salsa bar during the week  2. On the weekends, the free chips and salsa are accompanied by an AMAZING warm bean dip (praying it's vegetarian... or that I remain ignorant). 3. The spinach enchiladas are so good, it's crazy. Fresh spinach, cheese and a delicious verde sause. 4. The staff is always friendly and efficient. 5. the horchada  The only complaint I have is that the restaurant is often filled with families and kids who are messy... but what can you do? It's cheap, friendly and incredibly tasty, so families would be foolish to pass it up.   Salud!"}
{"text":"Took the Fam for lunch and experienced good customer service, wonderful food, and great margaritas!  Will definitely check them out again on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food is as good as the stuff served in many sit down (full service) Mexican food places.  Lunch is a more casual counter service but at  dinner time they switch to a regular wait staff.  Great tasting house margaritas (especially when they cost $2.00)."}
{"text":"Never been here...hubby & I thought we'd check it out.  Was not disappointed.  My spinich enchilada was great (my favorite ) &  his steak fajita was too. Service was very good and was reasonably priced.  Very clean appearance.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"West side location is very good. Not sure what happened to this spot."}
{"text":"Omg, if I could live on rice and beans it would be here, on top the shredded beef tacos-Awesome!! Fish tacos nice and light.  Chips and salsa bar is great. I need to other plates so I can expand my palate. The portions are generous so make sure your hungry!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we come in and both times the food has been GREAT!!! Very authentic Mexican food! Aguas frescas are bomb!!!! Waitresses are all very friendly!"}
{"text":"I just walked in accidentally and might as well ordered a \"plate\". After few moments the cashier (hot chick w/ pretty eyes and a nice thick booty) handed me a whole bag of food... at first i thought maybe its not mine... I asked her whether its mine and she laughed saying yes... the amount of food equates few plates... no wonder why mexican chicks look so thickalicious... they make champion servings... huge servings of meats n stuff... and everything's delicious... It dawned on me that I need a Mexican mistress... so I'll be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"You could get shived in the parking lot but I'll take my chances. The bean burro enchilada style is amazing and the green burro's on point. This is a top 5 Mexican food spot for me without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Gross,gross, gross!   Stinks and food sucks..... Wouldn't go back if food was free!  I dont know how they stay open. Made me gag."}
{"text":"I had to join yelp just to review this restaurant because 2.5 stars does not do it justice.  I had Mi Pueblo maybe 4-5 years ago and it was so bad I deciyoded not to go back. Then a friend wanted to try it this week, so I went ahead. We had a wide variety of foods. None of them were even passable. The chips were stale, the salsa was watery, the enchilada sauce was burnt to a black crisp, the quesadillas were undercooked and stale, the taco salad was bland and included virtually no lettuce, the flautas were burnt to the point that they literally could not be chewed.  This is hands down the worst Mexican food I've ever had the displeasure of eating. I can not recommend staying away from this restaurant strongly enough."}
{"text":"I really wasn't expecting this place to be spectacular because 90% of the \"Mexican\" restaurants in this town serve the same stuff the same way for the same price.  This place was no exception.  You get a decent plate of food complete with rice and re-fried beans for under $10.  The same ole' tacos, burritos, etc. you would find at just about any other place.  Nothing special to be found here.  I did enjoy the serve yourself chip and salsa bar.  The chips were good and the salsas were good as well.  I also liked that the staff was very friendly and the food was ready in under 5 minutes.  They have it all down pretty good for the 12:00 \"lunch rush\" of which I was a part.  My coworkers and I were out of there in under an hour.  I ordered the chile rellenos.  For some reason they felt the need to put some type of thick breading over the chillies.  This is no bueno.  However, after picking off the breading the chillies were quite good.  Spicy and full of cheese just the way I like them.  The re-fried beans and rice that came with the meal were just ok."}
{"text":"I was really happy to find this place a couple of years ago and I've eaten there once a week ever since. The food is awesome. Consistently high quality, flavorful, fantastic variety. They must have the fastest order-to-table time in town, and their prices aren't bad either. Weekday lunch? no problem. They make it quick and easy (and the margaritas aren't bad either!)"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here! Traditional Mexican fare done well.  Our party each received a cup of scratch chicken soup as a second course. My coworker excitedly proclaimed \"this is the best burrito I have ever eaten !\" My enchiladas were good, the endless pickled carrots and chips /salsa were also a nice touch. I will return next time in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants we have eaten at, and we live in SoCal.  Nice menu, good prices, great service - for both dinner and breakfast!  Their coffee is just okay, but all of the food is great.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Their food is good. Customer service is great. I love their bean dip and the camarones flores which they removed from their menu sadly. They were my favorite. Their piña colada is so good and their fried ice cream is a must try."}
{"text":"The chilaquiles with eggs were fantastic, and so were the beans that came with them. I don't know what they do to their beans, but they're amazing. The staff is also super friendly. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great mix between Mexican fast food and dine-in restaurant. Very casual atmosphere. There are TVs, but they aren't too loud to bother your dining experience.   I went with my family and we were greeted at the door. After we chose our own place to sit (outside or inside), we were given menus and had our drink and food orders taken. Chips and salsa were complimentary and the food arrived in record time! The food was good, but don't expect fine dining quality.  Our waitress gave us great service! We will be back."}
{"text":"This was surprisingly good for a random trip into a strip mall. The food comes in really good portion sizes and the price and amazing for what you get. Very fresh and tasty. Staf was very friendly and attentive. I have been back many times."}
{"text":"Sunday morning breakfast @ Mi Pueblo with Brother Mike.   The food here is so good.   \"HOW GOOD IS IT \"?  ?  \"It's Everything's made from scratch Good\"! The wait staff are attentive and wonderful. Chips are promptly served with salsa AND beans. Today we enjoyed the (made to order) Flautas de Pollo, con arroz y frijoles. The chicken is moist & flavorful, the tortilla, golden brown & crispy. Not greasy. . . Brother Mike enjoyed  & 's. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Living in Flagstaff for seven years, I would eat at Mi Pueblo every time I visited my folks in Mesa. I have tried a wide variety of selections from their menu, but I kept returning to the amazing fish tacos. Now that I live in New Mexico, where the very concept of fish tacos is all but unknown, Mi Pueblo is one of the places I miss the most.   Unlike most places, the fish tacos here are not fried and are not cod. Instead, you get big pieces of perfectly grilled mahi mahi (I believe), topped with fresh cabbage, cilantro, tomatoes, lime, some kind of tartar sauce, and cotija. The flavor is absolutely wonderful; everything tastes fresh and crisp and healthy. No greasy, soggy fish patties here. This is real fish.   I have never been anything but thrilled with a meal at Mi Pueblo. From the Mojarra Frita to the Chicken Avocado salad to the Ceviche to the Taco Salad to the Chicken Tortilla soup, it's all been good. I tend to gravitate more towards the Baja and seafood meals, as I have found this places a bit harder to find and Mi Pueblo truly excels in these areas. Additionally, they have a decent selection of beer and a fantastic salsa bar, offering several house-made salsas and sauces, pickled jalapenos and carrots, lime and cilantro. Everything you need, in other words, to doctor up your food to your own liking. This comes in especially handy for me, as I love spicy food and most places can't deliver that straight out of the kitchen. The prices here are very low for what you get. I actually can't think of any place that offers the same quality and quantity of food for a similar price. It's well worth a try if you're into this kind of cuisine."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Mexican food.  The meat is fantastic and I love the beans and chips. Customer service is awesome, also. They always accommodate to my needs and go above and beyond to make sure I am pleased. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is really hidden behind the ghost town that is Metro Center but that shouldn't stop you from trying this place.  The food actually really surprised me.  I haven't been able to find much authentic Mexican food here in Phoenix and this place is a little closer to home!  The tacos had a really good crunch and flavor.  The rice tasted like it was fresh and not hard and crunchy like some other places.  The prices were reasonable and I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I miss this place.  :(  Moved from Cleveland to Phoenix a few years ago.  And while there is tons of fabulous mexican food in Phoenix, I still think about this place.  This place is not tex mex  And its not the cheapest.  However, I still remember my favorite dish \"bistec con rojas y queso\"  MMMMM Beef topped with peppers and cheeses.... MMMMMMM!!!!  Service is terrible.    Chicken soup is handed out with every meal, and is made fresh daily in the morning.  The chicken enchiladas with green sauce are also SOO good.  So yeah, try it out!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I got a burrito with shredded beef, and it was delicious. The beef was juicy and flavorful, and the salsa was spicy and mouth-watering. The rice was pretty good, it was not dry at all (one of my pet peeves). The chips were just okay, but the salsa was good enough to make up for it. I loved how cheap the margaritas were, too- and they were really good margaritas! My husband and I loved this place, if we lived closer, it could be a dangerous thing!"}
{"text":"So another night drive around and a little find. I figure, you're in the southwest, gotta do Mexican food. Nice place, good size dining room with a large outdoor seating area. The menu is chock full of all the traditional goodies. So I decided to test them. I asked if I could have their super chimichanga with carnitas and chicken instead of beef and chicken. They said no problem. What they brought to me was perfection. Not overly oily like most places do, with good flavor and fresh ingredients. Topping it of with a nice cerveza made for a nice little meal. Service was excellent. My server was very friendly and she was more than willing to make the dining experience good despite it being not to busy this late.  I'll put this on my short list for Phoenix. All this under $20 to boot. Woot!  Let's update the music and we're golden."}
{"text":"This place is really good for breakfast, decent (but not great) for lunch/dinner. I really love their machaca & eggs, chiliquiles, and omlette, but I think all their breakfast offerings are pretty tasty. Service is usually quick and friendly, although sometimes you order at the counter and sometimes you get a waitress. Lunch offerings are what you would expect for any generic strip mall Mexican restaurant in the Valley. Although I've never exactly been blown away with meals here, I guess you've gotta give credit to a place thats managed to survive so long amidst the hulking carcass that is MetroCenter. So maybe it's worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good Mexican style seafood, but has kids friendly menu, street tacos, chimis,  really good menu do on Saturday and Sunday"}
{"text":"The food is O.K, but pricey! The best part however is Wednesday nights: Half-priced Margarita Pitchers! I can't begin to count the number of them I have ordered. The waitress are kind of slow though, and sometimes they give me plastic cups instead of margarita glasses. I have had much better experience when sitting at the bar, instead of a booth. The chips are free and served with green salsa, red salsa, and pickled carrots (it may sound weird, but its delicious!)."}
{"text":"My GPS tells me I'll be there right after I make a left at the next set of lights.  I see a Police Cruiser turn where I'm headed, fine.  I see another Police Cruiser Inch-by-Inch craaaaawl forward blocking my opportunity to turn.  Okay I get that I'm not in the nicest of neighbourhoods anymore, but do you really have to block me from my Food?  The Strip Plaza is quite rundown and some shops weren't even open for business this early evening.  A Public Library was at the further end while Mi Pueblo sits closer to Weston Road.  The large windows allow me to see that typical Latin American orangey painted walls that seem to be at every restaurant in Toronto serving Latin style chow.  It's a better looking interior than expected, it has the essentials of a clean Salvadorean flair dining space.  At least the TV was, since it was showing a Spanish speaking Drama.  One of the 2 women from the Kitchen comes out after awhile to give me a Menu.  No water was provided or offered so after ordering the Food, I went to the Drink Fridge next to the small-scale Dry Goods Shop to pick up a Sidral Mundet(Apple Soda $2.00).  The women didn't speak much(maybe English barrier) and didn't seem too enthusiastic but I'm not there to pick her up, so just get me the Food please.  Don't come expecting this as a full service restaurant.  From a Menu of Aperitivos(i.e. Seafood Cocktails), Tipicos(i.e. Yuca con Chicharron), Sides(i.e. Tamales), Pupusas(!), Sopas, Platos Fuertes(Mains), Platos Mixtos(Mixed).  I chose the following:  #21. Revueltas Pupusa(Mixed [Beans, Cheese & Pork $2.25)   -   It came with a side of Tomato Sauce & Spicy Slaw taken from the Drink Fridge.  It's not bad and resembles a bit of Burrito ingredients when I got to the interior Mixes of the Cheese, Beans & Chicharron.  I wished I had followed the next group of people inside the restaurant because that's all they had for Dinner, PUPUSAS.  #42. Bandeja Salvadorena(Salvadorian Platter)(Carne, Chicharron, Platano Frito, Arroz, Frijoles, Huevos, Ensalada, Tortilla $15.95)  -  The women gave me the Cutlery after the dishes came.  I got this sad-looking Knife that couldn't even poke a HOLE through a piece of paper.  At least they know that no one can rob them using their own Cutlery.  Cutting through the Carne was table-shaking teeth-grinding madness, Beef was Flank variety Minute Steak style thickness.  I've experienced better while the Fried Plantain, Egg, Beans were the better of the bunch, I was not impressed by the Salad, undercooked Rice, nor the while crunchy but super dry Pork(Chicharron).  Let's not get me started on the missing Tortilla, but even with it this meal can be considered good value for the price due to the amount of Food provided."}
{"text":"3 stars for being a decent Mexican restaurant near where I work.  Their food is pretty good, and they have some authentic Mexican stuff as well.  Problem is that their service was S-L-O-W.  At lunch hour, there were maybe 30 people in the dining room (it looks like it will hold about 100).  There were at least 5 front of the house servers plus the manager/owner, Mr. Ortega.  There was an 8 top and around 6 tables of 3-4 including ours.  We sat down at around 11:50 and didn't get out until 1:10.  This was because we waited for our food, and then waited again when we went to check out.  The entire server staff seemed weeded by serving the 8 top.  Then, after those people left, another 8 top of actual Mexican men came in, and the flirting with the female servers made our wait time increase.  Once we were ready to check out, our water busied himself with inputting the orders for the new 8 top, and the manger/owner stood there while we waited.  Finally, our waiter got up and went to the kitchen without ringing up our tabs, and the manager/owner took a sip of his comp drink.  When we asked if he could help, he was super nice, but it was a bit odd that he didn't think it strange that we three gringos were just standing there doing nothing.  So, in the final analysis, Mi Pueblo has good food, but don't go if you are on a schedule.  The servers were nice, and so was the owner/manager, and I would say that my experience there was overall positive, but I did get back to work later than I wanted to.  (they did seem to know that they were slow, because they gave us free soup and an extra basket of tabletop nachos while we waited...)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Its very authentic...not expensive....plenty of food  ..close by and people are great. I just discovered this place and i'd definately go again."}
{"text":"Great place. Been hard to find a great Mexican place lately and I'm glad we stopped here.  Delish"}
{"text":"My first time visit, I had an awesome meal experience. The cashiers were awesome and helped answer questions about entrees. The restaurant was clean, the staff was helpful. I loved the salsa bar and complimentary warm chips. I loved the steak and chicken nachos. I also tried the civache  but wasn't a fan. I think it was just personal preference. Overall great experience. I'll return."}
{"text":"I worked in the restaurant biz for many years and its really laborious and hard work. This restaurant was not at all busy today but it took the host 15 minutes to seat us. The waitress seemed clueless and unfamiliar with the menu. I told her exactly what we wanted and she still screwed the order up. I told the staff we were a little pressed for time. She seemed not to care. She gave us soup which we didn't order. I had a few bites. It was bland. The tacos were authentic but we got sidestepped by waitress because we ordered ala carte and she said \" once you order this item and don't SAY ala cart, it automatically comes blah blah blah blah.\" Bad customer service move. Bad. Don't EVER try to trick a customer into trying to spend more money so you can get a bigger tip. Fail. I can see right through it. Looks bad upon the management too. I am a generous tipper but shafted this girl today for her lazy brain. ASK people what they want and don't over promise and under deliver. I will not likely be back even though a nearby vendor recommended the place. Owner: get off your butt and save your restaurant!"}
{"text":"I presented a coupon that was from my credit card app on my phone. The cashier said that the coupon needed to be printed out because they don't have a barcode scanner. I told her the coupon from capital one didn't say it needed to be printed in the \"fine print\", in fact it said no code required. We went ahead an ordered. I love the bean dip that normally comes with dinner with chips and salsa but since it's lunch, you have to order and pay for it separately. Totally fine because I love it. It was served without chips as you get them yourself during lunch but in my opinion if you order the bean dip, it should be accompanied with chips. I also didn't eat my caldo de camaron because the shrimp was soggy and fell apart. Too bad that they have lost a long time patron because of this visit ."}
{"text":"This is a breakfast review.  Found ourselves at the Metro at 9:30am and store not open till 10.  So we went searching  for a breakfast place and found very slim pickings....down to Mimi's and this unknown Mexican place in a 70% empty shopping center.  Wow, we both said \"A hidden jewel!\"  Maybe we like less spicy than some of you, but we gave our ham and eggs burrito and omelet ranchereo high marks.  Very flavorful.  Big helpings and excellent pricing. Now we need to try it for lunch - we can't believe it goes down to a 2 or 3 star!  And btw, the place was very clean and our waitress was excellent!"}
{"text":"I dont usually 5 star a place, but they deserve it. Came here for the first time tonight because I had a coupon. No issues using the coupon either which is nice. I ordered the garlic cream enchiladas and they were very creamy and flavorful. The filling was dark meat chicken with some pinto beans which I thought was a nice surprise. Their refried beans were so delicious, they were fresh and slightly soupy which I love. Rice was a little spicy, and cooked well. I also ordered the guacamole appetizer which I requested with no tomato and they accommodated. They put queso fresco on their quac which was a nice addition. We eneded our meal with sopapillas which were rich and sweet, everything you'd want them to be. Customer service was quick and polite. All in all it was a winning experience and I will definitely be back. They are tops for Mexican food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years and always great food. The fish tacos are amazing"}
{"text":"Mi Pueblo is good, fresh, tasty Mexican food in the Ghettro center vicinity.   Prices are reasonable and the food is good. Vegetarian options are also available.  Their salsa bar is on point. They've got everything from roasted habanero tomatillo salsa, to a standard tasty red salsa that you would expect from a Mexican joint. Eat as much chips & salsa as you'd like.  I like to sit outside on their patio, which includes misters that help cool the area down a bit during the hot summer months.  If you're looking for some quick, informal Mexican food without the bottom of the gutter bertos feel, check out Mi Pueblo."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Mexican food place. Apparently, it has been purchased and is now called Si Señor.... It's now like every other Mexican Reataurant. No fresh chicken soup, not nearly as yummy. Really disappointed to see Mi Pueblo go.  That being said, food was okay, service was good and if you like that classic American-Mexican cuisine this would be a good option."}
{"text":"Mi Pueblows as I call it, has mediocre, overpriced food and the wait staff is terrible.  Went there once, never again.  Ordered a quesadilla off the menu for $10 (expensive huh?  just wait) and they asked me what kind of meat I wanted with it.  I said steak.  Got the food, it was okay.  Nothing special.  However, when I got the bill, I noticed that my quesadilla was $12.  I went up and asked them why and showed them the menu where it said $10.  They then showed me that in the description of the quesadilla, it says nothing about meat and if you turn to the back of the menu it says \"add $2 for meat\".  Scummy!  So I walked back to the table, took my tip and left.  My friends did the same.  $12 for a freaking quesadilla.  EDIT: I got a message accusing me of being a jerk for taking the tip away.  To get this straight, the server asked me \"what kind of meat I would like\" and did not tell me it would cost extra.  And at the end, she told me about it in a bitchely way.  Taking the tip away was warranted."}
{"text":"Update: Nov 20 2014. I think they've changed chefs or receipes the empanadas ordered today was awfully drenched with oil bad oil as matter of fact and the stuffing inside was salty and tasteless was a bad experience don't think I'll be coming back here for my empenada craving"}
{"text":"Best chips! Shrimp and spinach enchiladas are a must on the lite menu. Consistent food and great green chili."}
{"text":"Very amazing food!!! I got the tacos and it was bomb!!! Probably on my top 3 carne asada taco places! Highly recommend and the waitresses are very nice! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Quick Update for this place - because ... I think I was a little too harsh.  It's not that I can't even think about eating here, it's more that - it was just VERY much a place for alcohol consumption vs. eating.   Well, I have now, and it's not bad at all.  Give it a try.  It truly is A-OK.  Not bad, but not great.  I'd eat there again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of friends and we all thought the food was cheap and plain. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I'm up on Peoria Avenue this week for training, so I'm trying to go to a new place every day for lunch.  Mi pueblo was meh.  I ordered my food at 12:05 and it was in front of me at 12:10 which was impressive.  What was NOT impressive was the lack of carne asada in the burrito itself.  It had beans, and peppers, and onions, but VERY little steak.  The chips and salsa were ok, but with a drink I spent $11 and just didn't feel I got my $ worth.  My buddy got the fish tacos, and that seemed to be a better value - but I'm not in a hurry to go back.  Lociento mi pueblo."}
{"text":"Tacos are unique and the salsas are incredibly tasty. Rest of my plate (tamales and enchilada) were ok. I'd probably try something else next time... Or just eat more chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"We were told about this place by a family friend.  Food is super fresh and really delicious.  The ceviche was recommended and at first I was a little reluctant.  Glad I went for it! I'm super impressed with the quality.  The chimichangas were exceptionally prepared and crispy. We will return again."}
{"text":"When me and my family fly into Phoenix we always stop at Mi Pueblo. I usually get the chicken quesadilla and a salad with this amazing guacamole dressing. I've tried a number of things on the menu and loved each one. I guarantee that you'll love anything thats on the menu. Plus there's all you can eat chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"I stopped here while driving by, the food was good, You walk up to counter to order, which is a different experience. They have a chip and salsa bar."}
{"text":"OK. I have read the reviews and I'm somewhat baffled. This is still better than the multitude of Mexican places in this city that have ground beef as the main course. The steaks are great, but you have like skirt, or flank steak to appreciate this. The drinks are so cheap. The chips and salsa are very good. The alacarte stuff is the bomb. I think when the owner was there day in and day out it ran a bit more smoothly. But I have only had one bad meal there. Compared to the rest of the ground beef laden Mexican joints in this city, this is still far superior! Chingona buey!"}
{"text":"You are what you eat -- Mexican, Italian, Middle Eastern, New American, or what have you. As the product of Lebanese parentage, hummus runs through my veins, but as a citizen of the southwestern United States, Mexican cuisine is just as much a part of my identity.  Believe me when I say, then, that Mi Pueblo delivers the goods. There's no pretension in the food here, no misguided attempt to take time-tested dishes and give them a New American flair. The carne asada burrito (which itself is little more than marinated beef wrapped in a tortilla) comes with a side of rice. The fajitas come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas, meat, onions and peppers. What more do you need?  My family ate at Mi Pueblo for lunch. The restaurant was criminally vacant. The decor was, well, who cares? Dress it up with sombreros and guitars, pipe mariachi music through the speakers -- it doesn't really matter. The food is the thing. If that sucks, no amount of ambience is going to persuade me to enjoy myself. And the food is good.   The burritos will only be conquered by those with the most voracious of appetites. The chicken tacos are compact, crispy and served with a jalapeno sauce that has to be blended with crack. I won't hear otherwise. The fajitas get the job done -- they aren't really my thing. Our server was pleasant, helpful and gave me my Negra Modelo with two lime wedges and a freezing cold, salt-rimmed glass.  Look, I'm a man of simple pleasures. I like dark Mexican beer, tasty burritos and good service. Mi Pueblo has all of these things. When it comes to Mexican food in the Valley, we have an embarassment of riches. The hit to miss ratio tends to swing in favor of the misses. You could easily do a lot worse than Mi Pueblo, so do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, I love margaritas and I'm only kinda in love with Mi Pueblo.   The margaritas aren't the best. The mix is florescent green and usually tastes weak. The Vegetarian burrito is filled with things like steamed carrots, potatoes and broccoli. And to be honest the veggies don't taste very fresh, they all have that white, canned coloring to them.   I have been out of the country many times and this is far from the most authentic. I personally liked Luchitas the best but I would still pick El Rodeo over Mi Pueblo. The major thing that works for Mi Pueblo is the location and the late hours.   The food isn't the worst I've had but there IS better."}
{"text":"This place is good- solid. Impressive. They go above and beyond a typical Mexican restaurant. The salad had an awesome guacamole type dressing with pepitas! The fish tacos were awesome really thin grilled slice of fish with delicious spicy mayo. We were impressed with the chili reyano. They had self serve chips and salsa. The lunch margarita on special was only 1.99 for a perfect size serving!!! Thanks for a solid meal will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch quite often. Good food, decent pricing, and nice staff. During the weekday you order at the counter and they give you a number and bring the food to you. On weekends they have full table service so expect to pay a little more. Most of the entrees are your typical tex-mex, but still excellent tasting. They do have a selection of the more wild entrees, and even fresh oysters. There are several kinds of salsa available; I think the chipotle salsa is my favorite. After several visits I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I hate to give them just 1 star. I used to come here a lot for lunch with my former coworkers since it was close to our office and the food was awesome! I loved their salsa bar at lunch and their steak fajitas. Tonight, I decided to take my whole family (parents included) and was very disappointed. My son accidentally spilled his water, and in the process of us trying to clean it, we realized how filthy and dirty the floor was. It was terrible. After we ate, my husband found a floss (that kind that is individualized and what you usually bring for travel) on the floor next to our table. I seriously feel so gross right now after eating there tonight. Never again."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have had to date. We arrived to a restaurant that had only 2 other tables filled besides ours which seemed kind of crazy for 6pm on a Friday evening. After seating us, the waitress proceeded to stand around doing nothing about 10 feet across from us for a good 20 minutes while we waited to place our drink orders. And let me tell you what came back were 2 pretty small, watered down margaritas that weren't worth the price. Not sure there was any alcohol even in them and mine had something floating in it. And the cheese dip we ordered was tiny and tasted nothing like the cheese dips you get at every other Mexican restaurant in the world. Pretty much coagulated upon arrival. When we noticed a lack of a la carte items, my friend asked if she could just get a been burrito with red sauce and a side of rice. What they came back with (over 30 minutes later) was something the size of her head and stuffed with all kinds of crap and some gross brown sauce. My friend tried a bite and shoved it aside. The waitress and her co-worker proceeded to stand 10 feet away stare at us or into space and not bother to ask how our food was, or if we wanted refills on drinks or chips and salsa (which was all my friend was left with to eat for dinner). So when we finally received our bill, they charged us for her disgusting burrito. They thankfully took it off after we complained, but because the service was so horrifying, we decided not to leave a tip. Though when I went back to check my online bank statement, I realized the waitress had given herself a $10 tip on our $33 bill. I was horrified! When I called to complain, the manager was busy chatting with a customer and would call me right back. 1.5 hours later, I called again and he said he'd look at the transactions and call back. A woman called back and said that they did overcharge me...duh...and that the person that could credit me was not going to be back into work until Tuesday...a week later. I called back on Tuesday and that person was out of town and wouldn't be back for yet ANOTHER week. Fed up, I called my credit card company to dispute the fraudulent charges.  So if you want horrendous service and terrible food, that would be the only way I'd ever recommend this place (and from viewing the other reviews, I'm not alone.). Stay far, far away from Mi Pueblo!"}
{"text":"This place is in the wrong place for most people. Located in a dilapidated plaza near the Metro Mall, this restaurant should not be amazing. But it just is. And it is in the perfect spot for us. We have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed in any meal. The inside of the restaurant is not pretty. It resembles a fast food joint. The food is anything but \"fast food\" quality! Tonight we ordered carry out . The meals are served with chips, salsa, and refried bean dip, which is outstanding. We ordered the shrimp wrapped with bacon, which is served with refried beans, rice, and a small salad. YUM! It is definitely in the top 5 best Mexican dishes I have ever had. My hubby had the green pork burrito. It is huge! Also served with beans and rice. We love this place and hope people go there so it stays in business unlike most of the restaurants and stores located in and around Metro Center."}
{"text":"Excellent service and every dish is flavorful.  Been going for 8 years, never disappointed.   Chicken avacado salad and fajitas are fresh and flavorful. Waitresses always friendly and quick ."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The food was delicious. Will continue eat here when we visit Arizona."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, the locale threw me off but decided to give it a whirl and glad I did.  Once inside it actually remided me of being in Mexico.  We ordered 3 different shrimp entrees and they were all great and under $10.  The portions are HUGE and everything tasted really fresh except for the black beans which appeared straight out of a can.  Overall it was delicous and cheap and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very high price for what they give you  I purchased three bowls of menudo and 3 carne asada tacos thinking that that would be cheaper and wound up paying $41  The menudo was actually served in a cup instead of a bowl"}
{"text":"Best street taco I had in a long time so good. Had 5 ;) could of had 10."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, really large portions at a great price! We came here on cinco de mayo, and despite the restaurant being completely packed, we were served right away, and never ran low on salsa.  I got the beef enchiladas and it was great! The rice so good compared to what I usually have from other places. I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Finally got around to giving this place a try after passing it many times and telling myself that I need to stop in and see what all the buzz is about.   This past weekend I had the opportunity to come in for an early dinner before a movie around 4ish and the place was pretty much empty so service was quick. Once I entered the restaurant, I was asked if I wanted to sit indoors or out on the porch area. I love the outdoors so decided to take advantage of the cooler weather and sit outside.   Once seated our waiter came out and took our drink order. Since this was my first time here, I needed a few minutes to look at the menu as they have a pretty large selection to choose from. Everything looked good but finally decided on the Chicken taco salad which is on the \"Light Weights\" part of the menu. Large tortilla fried to perfection filled with beans, chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, guacamole and sour cream. Cost $8 which is a good price for the size. I was only able to eat about half of my meal. My guest got the Beef burrito that was served enchilada style and served with rice on the side. Their portion wasn't as big as expected and they were still hungry when we left. The cost was $10. The chips with dips of salsa and bean dip were delicious!! Salsa was fresh tasting but wasn't spicy enough for me. The bean dip seemed spicier than the salsa. Either way, they both were great and you can get unlimited of both salsa and bean dip.   Our waiter was very friendly and kept on checking up on us making sure we were doing well and didn't need anything. He always smiled and seemed happy to be doing the job he was assigned. Very pleasant to be around.   Will come back again and check out some of the other goodies on the menu."}
{"text":"Pitchers are the way to go! Margaritas the size of your head! (No exageration!!) Probably one of the best margaritas I've had.  Great food. Friendly service. No complaints!! Our new favorite Mexican spot.  Beyond traditional Mexican, the dishes are unique and flavorful. Don't overlook the carrot appetizer! Soup surpasses my expectations as well.    Parking is limited but was not an issue on our visit. The inside of the place is much larger than we thought it would be."}
{"text":"If I could go here everyday, I would and I would also be 500 pounds. It is soooo delicious. The salsa is good, the chips are better, the taco dish (I think it was called \"Six Halves\") was pretty freeking yumm and the side salad that came with it, wow.   The prices were reasonable. They have beer,wine and margaritas. The only thing I'd suggest is faster mamacitas (the service was slow)."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. It so good, can be busy at times but the food is amazing. The only meat I eat is seasfood and this place  makes great seafood with lots of flavor . I always have to swing by when I want something g that I know will be good for sure Nd I always customize my orders"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to come have a drink and grab some food. It's restaurant style food but in a casual comfortable environment. Horchata is really good here too! We got a wide variety of plates for breakfast including menudo and everything was delicious even down to the chips and salsa (and cheese bean dip too)!!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to stop and eat. I have never had a bad meal from here!! Could  be 5 stars if they pushed a little more on the organization and happy skills!!"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times, but the last time I went (3/7/08), all of us got stomachaches within a couple hours. Needless to say, will not be going again."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Have been twice now both at lunch time. One during the week and then again during the weekend. Very busy both times. During the week, the service is great, fast and friendly. The food was cooked to perfection. Went on a Sunday, and although the food was just as good, the service was a bit slower. However, the food was just as good.  1st visit - Had the grilled fajitas. Homemade and very good. Comes with beans and rice. The rice was fluffy and didn't taste like Phoenix water.....which most Mexican restaurants serve. The beans tasted as if they were made just minutes prior to serving. All you can eat chips and salsa made the whole experience worth it. 2nd visit - Had the grilled chicken salad burrito. Extremely fresh and so very yummy! It also came with beans and rice and both were cooked just as well as the 1st time. It did take forever to get our check and the to-go drink we ordered, but all in all it was worth it. Will go again."}
{"text":"Good home cooked food. Family ran, great seafood dishes and ok salsa bar (lunch only). Love the big shrimp tacos. Lunch time is good with a self serve salsa bar."}
{"text":"The food here is decent and pretty generic.  I ordered their carnitas torta which came in good proportions and tasted fine.  The food comes pretty quickly, but it is a little overpriced for such a shabby setting and its mediocre quality.  Coming from California and Texas, I've definitely had significantly better Mexican food, but this is pretty decent for Cleveland -- little less the midwest.  I would come back here, but not often.  It's a good place if you're tired of the commercialized burrito, want a hole-in-the-wall feel, and want to grab a couple of margaritas with some friends."}
{"text":"Damn I miss the one on the West Side.  I was in the free thinking, yet utterly commercial Cleveland Hts and knew this lil gem was still there from days back when I used to drink 40s in the alley before Teengenerate shows at the Euclid Tavern.  Just saw all the negative reviews about this place...damn.  Guess its not a Starbucks or some other bullshit burrito place masquerading as some hip, lifestyle centre.  Still same menu as the one on Lorain and I was stoked.  Half priced margaritas on Wednesdays so why would I be a turd and NOT have a whole pitcher?!  Now, I never drop servers names (I think its douchy) but this kid Dylan was so nice and outgoing I HAD to.  He actually gives a crap about serving and realizes being nice to people usually ends up in $$$$.  The special of the day was pasole and I wish I would have tried it but thats for next time.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant is the Mi Pueblo on Union Hills. My 2nd favorite is this Mi Pueblo located by Metro Center. The only reason it is my 2nd favorite is because it is way out of my neighborhood. But it is delicious.  No, it's not a coincidence that it has the same name and incredibly awesome food just like the north location. They are owned by 2 brothers. Interestingly enough, the food isn't exactly alike, but there are certain flavors and menu items that are similar.   I do like how this location has sit down service AND booze. Contrary to what the yelp description says about alcohol, it does not only have beer and wine. There is a full bar. And the last time I went, their margaritas were on special for only $2! And they were good and very STRONG... My husband was thrilled that he got me drunk for only $4.  They have an expanded seafood menu with all the traditional Mexican seafood cocktails...   Chips and salsa VERY good.  I had the spinach enchiladas which were heavenly. Not too greasy with 2 delicious enchilada sauces. Beans and rice were great too. My husband loved his fish tacos.  Service was perfect. Attentive and friendly.   Highly recommended! Give those big chains a break and try this family run little joint."}
{"text":"Definitely going back to this place. The food was quite a lot for the price (I paid $20). I ordered the carne asada and revueltas papusa to go. The menu said the carne asada just came with rice and salad but I was pleasantly surprised to find beans, tortilla and plantains with the meal. The papusa was really good and cheesy kinda like a meaty grilled cheese sandwich and it was only $2.95. I realize a papusa is good enough to fill me up, me being such a small girl. The steak was yummy, as was everything else.   Looks like they renovated the place, it seems like a very nice place to sit in.   But anyways, I feel like I'm going to be eating this for the next 3 meals. Score!"}
{"text":"Bland, monotonous food. Taco Bell is better."}
{"text":"I ordered take out the other day but have dined in a few times in the past. This place was busy!!! That must mean great food! I always get pupusas here since this is the only place close to me. It's good but I will be honest, I have had better. I absolutely love their fried plantains with beans and fresh cheese. So so good! I tried their enchiladas, thinking they were made the Mexican way, totally forgot this restaurant is Salvadorian. It was still pretty good. I would definitely come back and try other items on the menu. Great food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast, I was in a pinch and came here for a quick order to go and got the chorizo plate.  The chorizo was very good and the beans were too, but the cheese was smelly (think it was goat cheese), and the potatoes were deep fried looking and did not taste good at all.  I did like the chips and salsa and the atmosphere inside wasn't too bad for a casual mexican fast food joint.  I will probably come back since it is so close to my work."}
{"text":"Great food! Service, taste, food presentation! What more can I say! This is the place to try authentic Mexican food with descent prices."}
{"text":"The food here is really overpriced for what you get.  The burrito platter here is the same quality of food as fast food Mexican restaurants in Arizona (e.g., Filiberto's), but is twice the price for an equivalent meal.  The horchata here is good though.  Edit 3-1-08:  Went here again because I figured I'd give the place another try.  We got served cold chicken soup, and my dinner was lukewarm and not very good (soggy chayotes rellenos).  None of the other people at our table really enjoyed their dinners either, ranging from a fish entree to a burrito platter.  One of the servers dropped my knife on my coat, and got salsa over the sleeve.  Her reaction?  A quick \"sorry\" and she scurried away.  I'm not sure what the rush was since it was only us and one other table of people in the restaurant.  Our main waiter was not very helpful, and did not know what the ingredients in some of the basic dishes were, even though he had been working there for at least a year.  Plus, they didn't even have horchata tonight!  I'm taking off a star for this review, and I'm definitely not eating here again."}
{"text":"This place is good for cheap drinks near University Circle.  Everything else is medicore.  Service was a bit disorganized.  The pitcher of margaritas came without cups.  We had to ask several servers passing by our table for cups before we got any.  By then, the margaritas were melted.  It was clear that there was confusion on who was supposed to serve our table.  The food was average.  I ordered the torta with carne asada.  Overall, I thought my entree was bland.  The bread was not the freshest.   The salsa was also, in my opinion, bland - not much flavor or spice in the salsa that came with the chips.  If you are looking for really cheap (average) drinks for happy hour, then Mi Pueblo is a bargain.  But expect very average Mexican fare to come with your drink."}
{"text":"Soooo... I really -don't- want to review this place, because I would hate for you all to find it and crowd it up, but since I'm a good Yelper, I'll share this gem with you!  This is our favorite Mexican food place to go to, hands down. The boy and I have probably, combined, been here six times already within the past six months. A couple of things that make it so popular for us that we go, on average, once a month? Their mailer coupons, which offer a \"buy one get one free\" lunch AND dinner special, and their (now) $2.99 margaritas. Last time we came, their margaritas (all the time, not just happy hour) were $1.99, but apparently too many of you already are catching on, so they've raised the price a bit.  But for two people who are broke as jokes (literally... boo!), we get stuffed AND drunk, or what I like to call \"fat and sassy.\"  We've never ordered anything from here that wasn't good... that is a comment from the boy, because while he ALWAYS tries something different, I always get the same thing. Why mess with perfection??  My favorite meal: the veggie burrito, which comes stuffed with spinach and other random veggie goodness, and guacamole IN the burrito-- awww yeah buddy! Side of Mexican rice and black beans (or you can be healthy and get a side of salad.) Get in my mouth!  The boy's favorite meal now is probably the chicken fajitas he had last night, but he's also had their enchiladas, a few of their fish dishes, and some of their \"combined plates\", which are HUGE plates of food.  Prices for full meals range from $7-$13, and the $13 plates that I've seen are huge! Most, if not all, dishes come with sides, like rice and beans or salad, and guacamole, so you're really getting your money's worth.  Like someone else noted, you can get drunk here for cheap, albeit not as cheap as before. The drinks are $2.99, big and incredibly strong. Mi Pueblo knows what's up!  We walked out of there last night (using our BOGO coupon) for $25, including tip and 4 margaritas. Not too shabby!  Also, word to the wise: it's seat yourself mostly, so save yourself the awkward moment of coming in and standing there, looking like a shlub. Grab a seat, they know you're there ;)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I first saw this place on Groupon & it happened to be close to us do we tried it out. Basically-this is now one of our fave local Mexican food spots! The servers are always so sweet and the food is great-reminds us of home made. The place has a cute bar, great margaritas, and awesome salsa. Food is always consistent-I highly recommend trying this spot out."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican in Cleveland... If all you base your reviews on margaritas then maybe you should go somewhere else...Have a shot of tequila.  OVERPRICED???? Since when is the most expensive thing on the menu $13. overpriced.  With your dinner you get 2 salsas (and more if you want) marinated carrots and soup...made fresh everyday.  Let me tell you, I have been there 2 times at least a month and never have I had better Mexican.  Fresh Tortillas - fresh everything.  Please do not listen to stupid people.  I am so spoiled by this place that I go from Willoughby Hills to Cleveland for Mexican will not go around me because its a joke.    And the service is outstanding.  Kelly"}
{"text":"In a town saturated with this type of restaurant, this one stands out for its quality, service, diversity of menu and above all, EXCELLENT salsa. Usually busy, the locals know where to go for reliable, cost friendly delicious food. Try the seafood tostada!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best Mexican restaurant I tried in Cleveland (though I didn't try them all), and while it is not a model for consistency I still count it among my favorite places.  While it may not look like much from the outside, inside you will find a lively, colorful dining room (with an attached bar that leads into another portion of the restaurant). No complaints here.   Upon being seated you are given chips and two kinds of salsa, as well as pickled carrots (sometimes you get a jalapeno in there as well, though not always, alas). I can't say they are the best chips, nor the best salsas I've ever had, but they are better than most and are always appreciated. I typically ordered either a burrito or taco platter, but I tried some of the more unique entrees as well. With every meal you also receive a small bowl of chicken soup, which in my visits was always delicious and obviously homemade. A nice touch. Portions were generous, and it is impossible to leave hungry. Drinks range from the usual domestic and import bottles/drafts, to the margaritas, which like the chips/salsa are good but not world beaters. Still, they get the job done, and are half-price on Wednesday. Many of the beers are also very cheap, all things considered. Various tequilas are also listed, though many of my favorites were perpetually unavailable.   Now, more on the consistency factor...after the first several visits, it seemed rare to see the same people working there more than once. For regular diners this can be a bit off-putting. As such, the service would also vary, from great to casually interested. Short of one or two rare occasions, I can't really complain too much. I would suggest NOT going for a full meal late on the weekends, as this was the only time the food did not meet par...undercooked and slow to arrive (how that happens is anyone's guess). It appears that the drinks n' snacks crowd is the priority here at that time, but given its proximity to Case I suppose that is to be expected.   All things considered, after multiple visits, this place is a winner. Not perfect, but far better than many other options in town (and in other, bigger cities as well). It passes the \"authentic\" test, as you will always see Mexican families in the dining room, often celebrating a birthday party or other occasion. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant about 4 times in the last 2 years, though I haven't checked in each time, but everything I've had was tasty and delicious! Their fajitas and rice are excellent, refried beans are one of my favorites, and the salsas are freshly made and awesome! One thing I love that they don't make is salsa verde, but overall great quality and delicious Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but $4 for 1 taco and $7 for 1 cheese quesadilla.  After tax, you're looking at around $20 for 2 tacos and a quesadilla... makes no sense.  What has this world come to? Lol wow"}
{"text":"First time visit today. I had the Mi Pueblo enchiladas and he had the pair of chimis.  Service was good. We were only the 2nd table in there meanwhile both the first and second table we chose was sticky.  There were plenty of girls standing around with nothing to do. Salsa and chips were good. The waitress brought out a spicier salsa which was good. Enchis and chimis were good too. My main problem was the price. I feel that $40 is too much for 2 Mexican lunches in the Metro area. We didn't order alcohol either. Glad we stopped and checked it out though. I won't be back...only because it isn't the best deal when I am in the Metro area."}
{"text":"This place wasn't great, but it wasn't good either. I was very happy with the portion size and the Horchata was decent. I had the Tacos de Papa. Not a bad dish, but a bit on the bland side. Fortunately it was covered in cheese and sour cream. My main complaint had to do with the rice. It was hard. You just can't mess the rice up. The service was good and our waiter was very funny. I'd go back, but I just wouldn't expect the place to blow me away."}
{"text":"-Looks like a fast-food tex-mex place, but it is a casual sit-down, full service restaurant. They even had margaritas for $2.  -REALLY good food, BIG portions! $9.95 for a Carne Asada plate loaded with guac, rice, and beans. Not super cheap like a 'Bertos, but decent prices.  -FAST & friendly service! The food was brought out by the time we started digging into the chips and salsa...like SUPER fast!  -Chips & Salsa were delicious with the wonderful taste of fresh ingredients. They also have extra \"burn your mouth\" spicy upon request.  -Clean restrooms. Convenient parking.  -Located in a 1/2 dead strip mall, next to Peter Piper Pizza on the west side of the Metrocenter Mall.  -I would eat here again for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix.  (pair with an evening at Castles and Coasters with kids (or as a date and it is a great night out))  I love their food and will go out of my way to come here for dinner.  The shrimp with aijllo chiles was a refreshing dish --- so was the octopus with \"chunky salsa\"  (it is not what you might think --- very pleasant.  My kids and I always share a virgin pina colada --- nice and colorful --- a real treat  Nachos are warm and fresh --- which is quite welcome  Service is also always friendly --- a great place to be"}
{"text":"Best pupusas in the area. Been coming here since the it opened. Food is always good, service is great. I bring all my friends here."}
{"text":"The large portions are worth it for the price, so I would definitely recommend this place, even though the food itself is pretty average.  The soup appetizer probably came from a can, and should have been much warmer."}
{"text":"The margaritas were good ( on special for $2.99 ) My family and I showed up around 4:30pm on a Thursday. Shrimp tacos were good as was the shrimp Chimichanga. My daughter enjoyed a mango smoothie and 2 bean & cheese tostadas. There were maybe 6 other people in the restaurant at the time. Their were three waitress's in the restaurant averaging in age from 18 to 20 or so it appeared. I  Had to asked three times for water and had to go tell waitress we wanted our check. The waitress was pleasant but had to ask her what she said several times because she spoke so softly. The decor was very lack luster and the large photo's of food behind the cash register in addition to the sign that said order above register would lead one to think maybe you order at window ( had I not read the reviews of others to learn otherwise ),  Based on my experience would I go there again? probably not. Although had I been there during their peak time I might have thought otherwise."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to live right by Mi Pueblo. Now I don't get to eat here often because I live so far away.   The food is great. The service is great. I have never had a bad experience in the 7 or 8 years I have been going here. I have brought a bunch of friends to this place if we happen to be looking for something to eat in the area, and they have always enjoyed their meals as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for lunch with my co-workers - it's fast, cheap, and tasty. I love the chips and salsas. It is set up like a Baja Fresh only feels a bit more authentic."}
{"text":"I been here a few times and the food has always been great. I preferred this place over any other Mexican fast food restaurant.  The staff is always very friendly. No complains. Definitely recommend if your looking for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"After a long night of drinking and partying we couldn't figure out where to go because the restaurant the driver recommended was closed. We found this place and it was great. As soon as u walk in u get the smell of authentic Mexican food. Everything we ordered was great! Portions n prices were great!  Great options great service. We are from out of town this was our first time here highly recommend."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience.   Food was good, but expensive for the amount I got. I ordered the beef burrito that came enchilada style with rice on the side. The portion was good, but not great for a hungry guy like me. It was comparative to a Beefy 5-layer burrito at Taco Bell. The flavor of the burrito was very good as well as the rice. Both were well cooked and seasoned well. The complimentary chips came with salsa and a bean dip. Chips were crispy and tasted fresh. Both of the dips were delicious. A bit spicy for me, but still very good.   Service was quick and efficient. My waiter was very pleasant and took good care in making sure everything was to my liking. He came around often to check up on me and refill drinks and chips as needed. He always had a smile and was very polite.   I sat on the porch area of the restaurant so I can't really review what the inside was like. The outside seating is in the front of the restaurant facing the parking lot. There are several tables with umbrellas to keep the sun off you. The tables were kept clean and dirty dishes were taken immediately after people left.   A good place to come and get a good bit to eat."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place for some time now. Walking in they were very friendly. The friendliness went away when I started to ask what certain things had in them. My mom cant have onions, she's allergic. I just wanted to know if they could be prepared without onions or not. As soon as I asked they got very defensive and rude. Im not sure why? The young lady that was helping me seemed to have an attitude and was in a hurry.  The food did not take long. It came out faster than I thought it would. I ordered the Garlic Cream Chicken Enchiladas. They were AMAZING. Really great flavors and the rice and beans were a great side.  For mom my she got the steak tacos. The meat in the steak tacos was terrible, it wasnt even edible. It was chewy, leathery and the meat was very dry. The chips and salsa were good and the bean dip was amazing. All in all, its a nice place to try. It wouldnt be my first choice in mexican food as I can find a place that is more happier to serve me and have more tastier food."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic in every way. Friendly staff, fresh high quality food, and a nice atmosphere (as long as you're cool with Spanish music). I would highly recommend this place. I had the huevos rancheros and it is the best I've ever had. Free chips, bean dip & salsa with your meal! I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Will be back again to try more than just the tacos. Food was good. Worth stopping by if your in the area."}
{"text":"Surprised by the negative reviews. I've thought this to be the best Mexican place in town. No problem with the service or the food. Its far more comfortable than the Mi Pueblo taco shop on Lorain Avenue."}
{"text":"Good chips but that's about all, I decided to give them a try because of the yelp reviews and was disappointed, guess I'll keep looking for descent Mexican food."}
{"text":"I had heard from relatives that this was really good food.  I went for breakfast and decided to have the chilaquiles I was disappointed it had no onions or cheese  on them!  So bland, the beans were good but did not have enough cheese on them.  Place was clean and the ladies were nice.  Will think about going again maybe!"}
{"text":"Service as always was exceptional. The ladies are quick to greet you, seat you and take drink orders. Food comes out piping hot and fresh as can be. Tried the fish fillet in garlic sauce this time and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Mi Pueblo on and off for 10 years. I have had a very difficult time finding authentic Hispanic cuisine in Toronto, and from all the available Hispanic restaurants in the city, I think Mi Pueblo comes the closest - unfortunately for me, their location sucks (I live in downtown Toronto). Mi Pueblo is by no means a fancy restaurant with quick and efficient service. Instead, you need to come in expecting to wait as there is usually one person working in the kitchen and one working the front, and you can't get angry because that person in the kitchen is a grandmother. The menu offers the staples: platano, arroz, beans, yuca, pescado frito, pupusas, sopas, carne asada, chicharron, etc. They also carry the popular drinks: pinolillo, orchata, etc.  I think every dish is under $20, with pupusas ranging from $2.50-$3 and they each come with a salad called curtido and tomato sauce. Another thing I like about this restaurant is that they have a small grocery store at the front and they carry products exported from Central America you would not be able to find in regular grocery stores.  Writing this post has me craving home cooking, and I also heard that the restaurant has been renovated, so another visit is due ASAP!"}
{"text":"A huge steak fajita burrito for $10.Great service. Amidst a bunch of bland chain restaurants in the area, this place stands out."}
{"text":"I've been here over 100x and, sadly, I've never taken the time to write a review.  Their salsa and guacamole are awesome. The Taquitos Mexicana (carne asada) are to die for.  Basically, five street tacos with great tortillas, well seasoned tender steak, onions and cilantro.  Very simple and very, very good.  Service is always super friendly.  Sadly, the area seems to be struggling, but this restaurant is a gem!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible today, taco salad shell was hard & awful.  Server not nice at all. It was not the same,attitudes s different"}
{"text":"Great food and nice portions. Great customer service also. Nice casual family atmosphere"}
{"text":"Food is great but they are very inconsistent with portioning. I order cheviche  5 days a week which cost 12.45/day. The least they can do is keep the portion and the order right. They always forget the lemon or they'll try to charge me 2$ for extra salsa that they just throw out at the end if the day cause it goes bad.  I have work at restaurants before, number 1 thing is always be consistent and take care of your customers.."}
{"text":"This place has the best tamales that I have had in Phoenix! The bean dip sauce that comes with the chips is phenomenal--if you are into beans! Salsa is great. I have had the chilaquiles , enchiladas, and tacos. I am fans of it all! The drinks are a little overpriced. I would have liked to have seen a queso dip but heck, I will eat the beans! Its family friendly and has a small outside area for dining too. We have not had a bad meal and we are there once a week."}
{"text":"YUM!  Very tasty food, very reasonably priced.  Much better than I had expected given that it's in a strip mall.  I'd eat here often if I lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I don't get over this way much at all. This was a suggestion from a native Arizonan. The restaurant is tucked away in almost non existent Metro center. The restaurant is small but adequate with a very family feel to it. We were served almost immediately, which was great considering how busy it was. My date ordered the fish tacos and I had the huevos rancheros. Both were really good.  The fish tacos have to be the best I've taste before. The fish was so fresh. Not breaded. Just really good. The chips and salsa, especially the salsa were memorable. I will definitely be coming back to have my own order of fish tacos. I only got to taste my dates."}
{"text":"this used to be favorite mexican place to eat, until i found a cricket in my enchiladas. check your food. that is just plain nasty!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food! Have been eating here for 5 years and never a bad experience. The food is always excellent and service is great. I love the shrimp tacos with the salad an the veggie quesadilla."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food. The place can get busy on rush lunch hours. They also have daily lunch specials which I like because it's decent prices. But off the main menu it can get pricey. I like their ceviche but it's about maybe $12. But sometimes they would have that on their lunch special deals which they would sometimes be $2 each. Free chips and salsa! Can't beat that! The area is pretty ghetto in the metro center area. If anyone knows about metro center, you know what I mean. But then you're kinda safe because there's a lot of cops that comes here! I would say, it can be little scary at night FYI."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. Very typical Mexican fare that tasted exactly like very typical Mexican fare. I had the strawberry margarita too which actually had real blended strawberries - huge plus. The downside- almost zero tequila. I honestly thought they may have made a non alcoholic version! Overall, the prices are decent and the food does the job but it's nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I liked that some of the menu items were unusual, including the carrots served with every meal. My time in Mexico was too brief to judge, so I'll just assume that \"unusual\" here means authentic! Good.  Note to vegetarians: many meals (even otherwise vegetarian ones) are served with chicken-based vegetable soup: no substitutions, no option. (But if you ask in advance you can just skip it.) On the bright side, I'm told that both the rice and refried beans are made without lard or meat broths. That's good.  I've been twice. Of the two things I got, one (some kind of squash?) was fine, but more interesting than it was tasty; the other (quesadillas) was surprisingly small for the price, and the rice and beans seemed very old/dried out, to the point where the rice was crunchy. Neither one had much flavor. I'll probably try them again, since vegetarian rice and beans are hard to come by, but my expectations are low!"}
{"text":"I honestly thought the food was awesome! We had pupussas and ceviche, also hade this drink called horchata and tamales, we only spent 40 bucks between me and a freind and we could barely finish because there was so much food, definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and authentic. Cashier was nice and my food didnt take to long. I love their bean dip and Id recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I love this place and we go here often on our lunch break because service is fast, fresh, and friendly.   A couple of must have items for me: Chorizo, eggs, potato, and cheese breakfast burrito Chicken taco salad with the hard shell. The cilantro lime dressing is amazing! The Ceviche here is one of the best I have had."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican place.  This was my regular place for lunch when I worked in the area.  The grilled chicken salad is amazing.   Everything that I have had was great.  I would love to go there for dinner and a beer."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and a slightly more original take on standard Mexican fare. The veggie burrito is excellent and I am NOT a vegetarian lol"}
{"text":"Great food and price but the waitstaff some work. This restaurant also isn't in the best part of town as I did get my car broken into during one of my visits. It used to be one of my favorite Mexican spots when we visited the almost Empty Metro Center Mall. I stopped going after noticing that forgot preferential treatment from the waitstaff. I actually had the same exact order someone who came in five minutes after me yet they got there first. Also, the waitress called me Gordo."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food. Been twice and everyone has really liked their meals.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"So I am know for having a pretty sturdy digestive system and have been know to handle some pretty volitile foods with ease.  I eat at questionable roadside stands and holes-in-the-wall with ease in most cases.    Todays visit to Mi Pueblo challenged that fact.    Going in with coworkers for a quick bite to eat I ordered the Nachos.  Seemed ok until I saw that they also had put their red sauce/enchilada sauce all over the chips along with cheese, grilled chicken pico de gallo and refried beans.  WHY did they have to put that red sauce....ugh.  I picked through what I could and couldn't avoid some of it.   I also tried their habanero chipotle salsa and their salsa fresca, both fresh and tasty.    Fast forward about an hour.  Sitting in my meeting... *gurgle...gurgle...gurgle* Ugh... I pushed ignore.  But there came a point that I could ignore no more. Uhh Oh?!  Things were not right.  I may consider myself a queen, but the throne I have been spending the afternoon on is not what I expect.  Had it not been for my digestive distress and that awful red sauce, I would have considered 3 stars for cleanliness, service, average and generous portion size."}
{"text":"Mexicana foods in Cleve? Si!  This place is no frills, yet very mexican-y once inside.  But the food is pretty delicious and authentic. I haven't tried any of the entrees because I like the a la carte tacos too much--chorizo, al pastor and lengua (this one can be a hit or miss).  The bf loves the tortas.  Go Wednesdays-- 1/2 off margaritas (stiffy) It's also open until 2am!"}
{"text":"Oh my. Delicious. Came here to get breakfast and that was the best decision yet. I got the omelette rancheros... I can't even begin to explain how wonderful it tasted. The omelette was perfect. Honestly, I didn't really have high hopes for this place because of the outside. Now that I've experienced the restaurant, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is one of those places i used to go to with a friend every weekend.  After dozens of visits i can easily say this is one of the best Mexican restaurants i have been to.  The portions are great, the food is always good with excellent variety.  The staff are always nice and are on top with whatever you need. Their seafood cocktails are mind blowing.  It has been a while since i have been there since i have moved, but give a shot."}
{"text":"Dios Mio! As a lover of Mexican food, it is with great reserve that I say that this is- HANDS DOWN- the best I've ever had. Quality ingredients, fantastic diverse menu, delicious chips and bean dip and salsa!! Seriously, incredible.   We were visiting from Cali- another Mexican food mecca, and glad that yelp steered us here."}
{"text":"I thought it would be a dive, but it was really good! The place is clean. The decor is tasteful. (I think of Restaurant Impossible when I try a new place out.)  I had grilled shrimp tacos and the shrimp was DIVINE. I'm not even kidding. It was spiced just right, and the tortillas held up to the weight. I love the salsa bar. Staff was super friendly, too.   I am craving those tacos again, and I was just there 4 days ago. I will definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate Cinco Do Mayo a little early, and chose Mi Pueblo based on the Yelp reviews (Thank you by the way :)   ),  Between the two of us we had chips with a few types of salsa (chipolte one the best), guacamole (one of the best I have had in a restaurant), fish tacos served with rice and a surprisingly good salad, shredded beef taco, chile relleno and tamale.  I admit my knowledge/experience with Mexican food is not that large, but my date is a Mexican food snob and says its one of the best Mexican dinners he has had in ages..  The service was fast, friendly and efficient.  We will be going back most definitely !"}
{"text":"When I think of Mi Pueblo, the word that comes to mind is salt! The rice and beans, which seem to accompany every entree were heavily salted as was the relatively flavorless soup that seemed to precede every main dish. The bright sides were the pickled carrots (who knew?!) and the salsa, which was okay. All in all, not a recommended restaurant unless you've got a hankering for Mexican that's so powerful you feel like you're gonna cut someone"}
{"text":"Really good food!  When I showed up, I was a bit skeptical. It had decent decor but there were hardly any people at 10:30 for breakfast.    The breakfast menu options were, in my opinion, fair. They had huevos rancheros, chilequiles and a Sonoran dish where the eggs are covered with a garlic cream sauce. I've always been the type to try something new, especially since I've never heard about it, so I chose a plate with three eggs that are covered with three different sauces (red, green, and garlic cream). It was delicious. The cream sauce alone is a little weird, but when mixed with either chiles, it is phenomenal. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the potatoes were cooked in chorizo fat that added a little kick, and the beans were decent and topped with contija cheese (which i thought was an added bonus)  Over all, I'd give the food an 8.   The service was also decent, even tho I once did have to ask for a refill on my coffee.  But this was because the restaurant suddenly filled up..    Kudos to the chef, who was able to make restaurant food taste as though it was made by my very own grandmother..  :-)"}
{"text":"Went last night with my girlfriend for date night. Walked in, got a table, we both used the bathroom (which were absolutely disgusting), individually. In that time we never got any menu, any water, any attention. The restaurant was not busy with 3 servers (including what looked like the manager).  We finally decided to leave after waiting and being acknowledge but ignored, all the servers watched us leave and didn't try to stop us or anything. I ate there once before and loved the food, but this experience was just awful.  We couldn't tell if it was because they were homophobic or just rude. Either way, no longer worth our time and/or money."}
{"text":"If I ever made one of those lists and titled it \"Places That Are Open Solely Because They Are Within Walking Distance of Case\", this would be on it.  I'm not one of those folks who thinks that ethnic food has to be very authentic and close to what you'd get in the food's nation of origin. I love Taco Bell and pretty much any Americanized Chinese restaurant that's on the map.   ...But I am one of those folks who wants food to be GOOD. Mi Pueblo's food just isn't good! I've gone there several times and ordered a wide variety of meals, ranging from the bold to the boring, and they've been disappointing every time. It kills me to give it two stars, because I would eat at this place eight days a week if it were good because I love Mexican, and it's also the place that my mom first met my now-wife and later on told me that she was delightful...but since one of the worst things in life is a bad meal, I must, so that others are not led astray.  The only reason that this place gets two stars is because: 1.) The chips and salsa, which flow throughout the meal, are quite good and 2.) They have free parking. Around University Circle, it's easier to find a four leaf clover than it is to find free parking.  If you're visiting University Circle, plan on skipping Mi Pueblo."}
{"text":"Best mexican spot I've found in a long time, I'm from the border so I'm sensitive about my mex food. I got the supreme combo: a shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada, red beef  tamale and chile relleno because I read the reviews and had to try everything. Omg taco and enchilada were good, pretty standard but the chile relleno and tamale were the best I've had in 11 yrs in Phx. Had a well margarita that was really good too, beatiful night to sit on the patio. Super casual atmosphere.  I'll def be back often!"}
{"text":"My all time favourite place to get pupusas. I see a lot of complaints with customer service but personally haven't experienced any bad service. The staff are attentive and very nice! The menu items are priced well. I've recommended this place to practically everyone I know. My friends enjoy mi pueblo as much as I do"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Loved the bean dip and chips.  Ordered the combo chicken flautas. The chicken had a great flavor.  Kids eat free on Sunday with paid adult combo. Everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Mexican food in Cleveland... why must you be so blah.  I wasn't really expecting much. o this place pretty much met my expectations.  This is a 2.5 star sort of place rounded down for one reason... no joke or hyperbole, straight up the worst Margarita that I've ever had.  I honestly think that the bartender forgot something... either that or wow... just wow.  I had a lime margarita on the rocks that I swear was missing the lime part... it was seriously ice water with a splash of cheap tequila.  I've never had a margarita that tasted like water... so awful.  Thankfully it was 1/2 off.  Charging $8 for that would have been a crime.  The food was meh.  Had the tacos de pescado.  Was definitely not expecting deep fried tacos... very odd.  Tasted OK, but still wtf. The rice was good, though it tasted just like fried rice from a typical cheap Chinese place.  The beans were probably the best part which is generally not a good sign.  Overall another place that would never survive in a place with actual Hispanic culture. Most likely won't be back.  At least the service was OK, but that isn't nearly enough."}
