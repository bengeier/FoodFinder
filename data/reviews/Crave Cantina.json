{"text":"Aaron Hervey had done it again! Crave Cantina mixes exotic ingredients to create the most unusual, scrumptious tacos you've ever tasted. Wine offerings, like the Spanish Albariño, keep up with the mixed drinks. The atmosphere is hip, with a hustle vibe. Staff is well trained too! Thank you for your originality, Aaron!"}
{"text":"The chef and staff were amazingly accommodating to my food allergy issues.  I will definitely dine here again.  The food was amazing and the chef, sous chef and Zara our server went above and beyond making our experience the best."}
{"text":"We were very excited when we saw that this new restaurant had 2 vegan tacos offered on their menu so we went last night with friends. The decor is really nice. The light fixtures are gorgeous. Our server was fantastic. Very friendly, and attentive. We all shared a trio of guacamole, (traditional, mango and charred corn). All were really excellent. We also shared a trio of salsa (,tomatillo, cuban black bean, and watermelon mango basil mint). Also super delicious. I especially loved the watermelon one. Very unique flavors and it went very well with chips. Between the four of us, these 2 appetizers were plenty to share and the chips are refilled if needed. They have a fantastic drink menu also. I would definitely return even just for drinks, guacamole and salsa. There are entrees offered, but we all ordered the individual tacos. I love that you can order each one separately, (each priced from $3-$4). My favorite was the vegan nashville hot tofu. Tofu cooked with a spicy coating and served with coleslaw and pickles. It was amazing. We also ordered the chinese jackfruit ones which were a completely different flavor, tangy and delicious. My friend ordered the duck, shrimp, and buttermilk chicken tacos. He said they were all fantastic, the duck being his favorite. From the side dishes, we ordered rice and pico de gallo quinoa. Both were Ok on their own, but we added salsa to them from our appetizer, and that made them even better. We had no room for dessert. Maybe next time. We left stuffed, satisfied and already talking about when we will return."}
{"text":"This place has great potential. We ordered the curried chicken empanadas, and the Arepas to start. The empanadas were delicious and I would order them again but the Arepas definitely fell short. They were fried so hard it was hard to eat them. The tacos looked awesome on the menu and reminded me of a very popular Tako place in Pittsburg so I was excited. We ordered corn tortillas to be more authentic. That's where they really were lacking; the tortillas. I'm pretty sure they didn't even warm them up. When you went to eat the tacos they cracked in half and everything fell out( they were soft corn, not fried corn). They were so dry. Most tacos served in corn tortillas are grilled on the grill before putting the filling in. It would seriously make this place so much better. We ordered a pitcher of Mojitos which were great tasting but pretty sure it didn't have hardly any alcohol in it. Just a few tweaks and this place could be fabulous."}
{"text":"Crave Cantina carries the same warm glow as it's sister restaurant in Akron. The interior is nicely done with lots of color, glassworks, exposed bricks, ironwork, and rough wood. The drinks were creative and nicely sized. I was extremely disappointed that all of the salsas were so hot!  I was told by the server that the watermelon one wasn't hot despite habanero being listed as an ingredient. We tried it in our salsa trio. The flavor was great, and I wanted to share salsa with my three year old \"foodie\".  I gave him a couple of bites, until I ate something SO HOT I ALMOST CRIED. Thank God my son didn't get that in his bite!  I loathe when restaurants have only spicy salsas. They could easily make the same batches, put hot peppers in half of the batch, and leave some without the heat.   The tacos are small, so I ordered another one because I didn't eat the chips and salsa after my tastebuds were  set on fire. Spent a lot for lunch and my son and I were not full when we left."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. Highly recommend it. Great food - small plates, had special of the day, flank steak tostadas. The corn side dish was my favorite. Had a pitcher of margarita. If I lived close by, this would be a regular."}
{"text":"If I could split a star, it'd be a 4.5 but rounding up! Seems like everyone is trying to go for the $3 taco and Crave Cantina was a hit, just like other places a little better for this style for food."}
{"text":"LOVE the Crave brand! Sadly Out of the 6 tacos we got 4 were good. I Was just not as happy with this experience as I've been at the crave in Akron unfortunately. I love the location, and decor looks awesome!   The tortillas were fresh out of the bag not warmed or toasted in anyway. They were cold. The brisket and the lamb tasted off, not foul but not good and as though it may have been the seasoning or the cut of meat. Those two tacos neither of us ate :/   Beer reasonably priced, bartender nice. Will return for the location, food is just okay at best."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious, it is fantastic but the service was very bad and they forgot some things that we ordered. Also some of the food came cold and we ate almost our whole meal and our drinks never got refilled. Also burnt cheese on the mac n cheese was too overpowering, most of the time burnt cheese is okay but this time it was too overpowering. They might be under staffed, the service didn't use to be like thus until they had gotten super busy. Overall the food was good and the service wasn't good but the people were nice."}
{"text":"New to the Akron area, I've had a hard time finding a taco place I like. A girlfriend suggested Crave Cantina and I'm so happy she did!  Appetizer: The mango & goat cheese guacamole is killer - not too heavy on the goat cheese which I feel like most places overdo.  Tacos: chicken taco was great, fresh and crunchy ingredients, option of flour or corn tortilla (I ordered the flour for both tacos)  Nashville hot tofu taco: good, a little thick but nicely browned exterior on the tofu. Toppings were a great flavor combo. Could use a little less tofu, but I just chopped mine up into littler pieces and it was just right.  Atmosphere is laid back - could be great for date night, friends night out or grabbing a taco by yourself at the bar.  Plenty of seating, only 1 male and 1 female bathroom.  Pricing was good, looks like they have a ton of happy hour choices but since I dined outside of that I can't speak to it."}
{"text":"I love tacos. Let me start by saying that. So when I saw that there was a new taco place on Front Street when I was at one of the fests (can't remember which one) - I knew I had to try it. I went on a Thursday night with my cousin, not thinking that it would be too busy - because it's a Thursday night and with all of the construction, I didn't think it would be bad. I was wrong. But that is great for the business, considering how much the construction sucks. Anyway - we ended up sitting at the bar, which was completely fine. The bartender ended up being someone I went to highschool with, and she was fantastic. We started with the chips and guac. The chip were a little salty for my tastes, but the guac helped offset the salt overload. I also order an original margarita, which was huge and delicious. (I actually had trouble finishing it). I got 3 tacos - which in the end, I would have been good with 2 because I only ate half of 2 of them because they were too spicy (I can literally tolerate no spice, so something that may not be spicy to someone else, it will set my mouth on fire). I got the marinated chicken taco (not spicy), the flank steak taco (had a little kick that built) and the chorizo taco (also a little kick that built up the more you ate it). In the end, it was too much food but it was delicious, so naturally we had to keep eating. The vibe of the place was great too - I didn't really walk out of the bar area, but it looks like they might have a great view of the river.   Also, the place takes reservations, so plan accordingly. I know I will next time I go!"}
{"text":"Pineapple Express drink was good- various unusual taco varieties. We were served by Tracy and she was very helpful and friendly. Great service- Mac n cheese came highly recommended so we ordered it- it is baked and lots of cheese- three of us ate it- two of us didn't care for it but the third loved it- so really a personal preference. Had the lamb, duck, walleye, chorizo, shrimp and chicken tacos. They were all very unusual and tasty. Overall a good experience- not our go to for normal dinner but a nice unusual dinner experience."}
{"text":"This is a great little Cantina tucked away in Cuyahoga Falls.  My son and I had dinner there recently.  The tacos are unique and the specialty of the house.  We started with the trio of the 3 Guacamole - we chose the Crab, Mango, and Charred Corn.  They came with a good amount of chips.  We then had (and shared) these tacos as our main course -  Smoked Leg of Lamb, the Coffee Barbacoa Duck Confit, the Vegan Chinese BBQ Jack Fruit, and the Flank Steak Bahn Mi.  All were delicious and well prepared.  We ordered one taco each at a time and savored them, and then ordered another.  This was a good strategy so as not to order too much and to have a leisurely dining experience.   Our server was very helpful - it was our first time there and her recommendations were excellent.  They have a carafe of water on the tables, so you can refill your water glass without having to ask a server - this was great - especially when eating spicier selections.  The decor is cool and the ambience is casual and inviting.  We will be back !"}
{"text":"The queso was probably the best queso I have ever had. Also the passion fruit sangria was excellent. Granted we are here on a Tuesday afternoon so service was very good. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Well..... I was so hoping this would be good. But even before we sat down there was total confusion at the hostess desk.  Not organized. The margaritas were good flavor but no alcohol to taste.  The tacos( walleye was good but puny) the tuna tartar was good. The chiqualitos  were soggy at best. If your looking for good Latin this ain't it. Too bad. I wanted it to be good.;"}
{"text":"I usually go somewhere local twice before writing a review but this place was so awesome I didn't want to wait to write it.   Love the decor and vibe of the restaurant..the open kitchen is cool. There is a small outdoor patio and a nice bar inside.  We sat in the back overlooking the river walkway. Only downside was were we sat was right by the ice machine so it was kind of noisy.   We started with the guac trio..charred corn, bacon, and shrimp. It was a bit pricey at 16 but the guac was awesome(all three kinds) and the house made chips were even better.  I would have been happy eating the chips plain!    I had three tacos and so did my husband. Each were layered with flavors the hit every note..sweet, spicy, savory, sour, crunchy, soft. It was crazy how such small bites could pack so much flavor. I had one that was on special, the pork belly, that needs to be a menu constant for sure.   Our waitress was sweet and attentive. She reviewed the menu and concept with us and gave good recommendations."}
{"text":"The Latin poutine is AMAZING. But if you get it as an appetizer you probably won't want anything else. My husband and I have tried every taco in the menu. The Asian- inspired ones are particularly good. The salsas and guacamoles are only ok, but the queso is good, as are the cocktails.   The wait staff and and bartenders are always friendly, but the hostesses are kind of rude. No matter what, as soon you walk in they ask if you have a reservation. If you say no they are visibly annoyed....even if there is no one else in the restaurant. But ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"The wait was long so make reservations. Other than that service was friendly and good. Margaritas and guacamole very good, try the bacon and the crab!  Mexi corn is pretty good but not as good as street corn! We all ordered different food so what we can say is that everything we had was good...Calamari and fries, the buttermilk chicken taco, the lamb tacos were very good and the cubano was excellent.  You can't go wrong to have a seat on the patio and relax and have a cold drink and a great appetizer!"}
{"text":"Owner told our waitress it was $0.50 cents extra for extra limes for a taco. (You have to be kidding me!!) Sent them back. 20+ minutes to be greeted. Margaritas are mediocre at best. Food is way overpriced and not great. Wouldn't waste my time or money. Server was nice and did a good job though."}
{"text":"This is one of my husband and my go to places. Tacos are always very good - walleye and the two chicken varieties my faves. Great guacamole with homemade chips. Staff is always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account just to recount my story and warn people.  Long story short - several people got VIOLENTLY ill after eating here, owner shrugged it off with a joke.   I'll never eat here or at Crave again after over a decade of going there. I'd have given it a second thought (maybe for a drink only) but their customer service afterwards was as bad as the food. BEWARE.   Attempted to eat dinner here a few weeks ago to celebrate a birthday. I was excited to see the improvements they're making to the riverfront - a nice place for tacos in the Falls? Perhaps too good to be true? (Spoiler alert: Yes, too good to be true.)   We had a reservation for 5 people and while the restaurant was only maybe 1/4th of the way full, they sit us at a tight booth. 5 people + winter coats + purses made for a REALLY tight fit, but I brushed it off since it wasn't my birthday and everyone else seemed happy. I literally couldn't move my elbows more than a few inches in either direction and it was pretty uncomfortable. My mom noticed later they sat a 6 top next to us and they all looked uncomfortable, too.   Ordered a round of drinks and some snacks for the table. My margarita was fine, my mom got a cocktail that tasted ok too. We ordered the Queso and a trio of Guacamoles - the guac tasted like the pre-made stuff you can get in pouches at the grocery store. Mixing in items is a clever way to doctor it up but definitely nothing special.   However - the Queso. Another yelp reviewer noted it tasted \"off\". We were expecting some warm, gooey, cheese with a dash of spicy chunks of chorizo, at least of the caliber you can get at any mexican restaurant in the area. Instead we got a weird, goopy, almost paste-like sauce with some ground beef in it. It reminded me of the Chipotle queso fiasco, or that weird nacho sauce you can get out of a can with a pop top. My mom took one bite and hated it, and my husband couldn't reach it (see: tiny table for 5) so he didn't have more than a bite. They were the smart ones. The rest of us continued out of hunger and wanting to balance out the booze.   About 45 minutes later, I start feeling off. Sweaty. Queasy. I've stopped drinking my margarita, stopped eating. I had ordered a taco but at this point I've completely lost my appetite and just feel really miserable. By the time our food comes I'm taking deep breaths and just trying not to get sick at the table. My stomach does that gurgling thing where you know something's up and I turn to my party, apologize, and ask my husband to take me back to where we're staying before we've even paid the bill or done gifts.   Yelp, it was BAD. You know the movie Bridesmaids? That kind of bad. I feel horrible and like I've ruined the birthday girl's evening but chalk it up to a bizzare reaction to an ingredient or maybe I've caught the flu until the next morning when I find out BOTH the birthday girl and my brother have had the SAME reaction, running in the door to be violently ill after they got home from the restaurant. I live 2 hours away from them and the only thing we had in common that day was that damn queso. Poor birthday girl had to call all of her friends and cancel the rest of her birthday plans last minute because of how sick she got.   We email Crave Cantina the next morning to let them know what happened and explain and get a response back from Aaron, the proprietor. He rattles of a laundry list of certifications and ways they prep their food. Then he says \"He wishes there was something he could do\" and calls it a \"head scratcher.\" A HEAD SCRATCHER. I'm not a food expert but it's not hard to see what happened here, and as the owner of the restaurant, there's absolutely something you can do here to rectify the fact that whether it was a food safety issue or a bad batch or whatever, we all got really, painfully sick and did not enjoy our experience.   I sent Aaron an email back asking if there was really NOTHING he could do and for some sort of refund - we spent over $100 and at the very least, would like to take our guest of honor out for a re-do to make up for the fact that she spent her birthday in the bathroom after cancelling the rest of her plans - and have heard NOTHING. I hate to be the guy that gets on Yelp and probably would have let it slide had they been at least apologetic in an email or explained why there was \"nothing to be done\" but his condescension and smugness towards the whole thing left as bad a taste in my mouth as that queso did.   NEVER AGAIN. Don't go here."}
{"text":"The food was very decent but the margarita was disgusting! Margaritas are not supposed to be sweet - this one tasted like a melted popsicle stick, complete with a heavy dose of high fructose corn syrup.  Salsas we're fresh, tasty, and spicy (which is how salsas are supposed to taste). I can't understand why anyone would go to a Latin restaurant and complain about the spice level - this cuisine is freakin spicy! If you don't like that, then don't eat it!!  The queso was off. It tasted like a botched attempt at adding a roux to a cheese sauce. It was very starchy and bland. The chorizo was most certainly not authentic and just tasted like ground beef.  The empanadas were pretty tasty and the sauce that was served with them was excellent.  No issues with the service. I found it to be quite good.  Overall, 3.5 stars for the food and 2 stars for the Margarita (aka kids drink with a little alcohol added)."}
{"text":"If you know anything about the restaurant Crave in Akron, be prepared to be swept off your feet by their newest restaurant. Crave Cantina is taking the spot light with delicious Latin inspired food. Two of the crafted drinks I had were the Pineapple Express Margarita and a Berry Mojito. I can definitely see myself stopping by just for a drink! Cheers! Now let's get to the important stuff..the food. We had chips and salsa, queso dip and empanadas. All were very tasty but the salsa is by far the best salsa I have had. My fiancé had 3 different kinds of tacos: buttermilk chicken, chorizo, and one with grilled chicken. You won't be disappointed with the full flavor each one presents! I devoured an Adobo Glazed Salmon and wow the flavor was amazing. From the quinoa and pico to the sweet glazed salmon to the fresh green beans. We left talking about when we could go back again next. Look out Front Street because a new delicious restaurant is on the block!!"}
{"text":"Really inconsistent quality drinks and food. Have been here a handful of times since my initial review, but will not be back again. An ice water with a lime in it would've been stronger than our margaritas. We came for a little date night and couldn't even stay after one drink and an appetizer."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Food not so much. Dry corn tortillas. Salsa tastes like it's from a can. House hot sauce is basically doctored up franks. I don't crave crave cantina."}
{"text":"We went there this past Saturday around 5:00 and they had a decent crowd. Atmosphere is very good and inviting. There were 6 of us but they squeezed us into 1 booth. It was a little tight but we made it work. We got 2 different salsas and 1 queso. The apps were good. Where it drops off is the dinner. We got a variety of tacos. None of them wowed any of us. They were average to below average at best. We are no Mexican experts but have been to many other places around the area and they are better. We would go back but probably stick to just drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere on the new and bustling Front Street entertainment area.  Get 3-4 different tacos, be adventurous, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a dozen times, we love sitting at the bar.  Great margaritas and drink selections . They make me an awesome mango drink that's not on the menu. Very friendly staff!  Food is very good, love the different flavors of guacamole, must try the trio!  Variety of salsas to pick from too.  We LOVE the tacos, lots of choices.  The buttermilk chicken is my favorite. My husband has had the Cuban sandwich and that's delicious too!  We enjoy sitting outside when weather permits!  Have met the owners and they are very nice! The Mexican corn on the cob was too soggy.  Prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"My husband and I are vegan and loved that Crave has multiple vegan tacos. Personal favorite was the Vegan Chorizo Taco and BBQ Jack fruit Taco. It has a great atmosphere and the staff is really friendly and helpful on drink recommendations. However, my only suggestion is having a basic or basic flavor margarita. I love strawberry margaritas and all the margaritas were unique with interesting flavors, if you like that kind of drink. I would've liked to have the option of a classic margarita. I ended up trying a margarita-tini because it has peach. Not much flavor, but super strong."}
{"text":"I have never been more disappointed with a meal in my life.Went here hoping that it would be better than the actual Crave restaurant (which is also shit) and they proved that the brand can't do anything well.  Not only was the service mediocre at best(there were only 4 filled tables and it took close to 20 minutes to even order,and I never got a refill on my tiny glass of water),but the food was absolute garbage.The salsa was not worth the $3,and don't even get me started on the tacos.  We ordered 4 tacos,flank steak w fried egg,fried chicken,shrimp,and duck.Let's start with the steak taco which was by far the least terrible of them all-the steak was chewy and overlooked,and there was a pathetically scrambled egg on top,not a fried egg.The only part that wasn't terrible was the aioli on it. Let's move onto the chicken taco-it was dry,sweet and mostly flavorless. The shrimp taco tasted like the shrimp was going bad,and it was way over cooked.It was a Thai green chili shrimp taco,but the sauce was not Thai,nor green,or even chili for that matter. But the worst of them all was the duck taco.What they did to this thing to mess it up so badly,I'm not even sure of,but it tasted god awful. Everything was overly sweet and the tacos were damp with their attempted sauces.It's like the chef has never even tried any other food besides boring American food,because everything was cloyingly sweet.There was no depth of flavor,there was no nuance.  I can't believe I spent $30 on an inedible meal.  Do yourself a favor and head up to Cleveland for Barrio's,they know how to make a damn taco,and they know their way around different cultures.Or if you don't want to drive far,Ranchero Taqueria's is a delight.  Don't waste your time with this ridiculous excuse of a restaurant.It was clearly opened with a lack of care for culture."}
{"text":"Love this place! I only get the tacos (although they offer other food items on the menu) because the variety is perfect for vegetarian/vegan. And they don't offer anything other than tacos for vegetarians. The vegan bbq Chinese pulled jack fruit is my favorite taco, I get it every time. Something different from the usual taco. I recently had the vegan chorizo and it was delicious just a little spicy for my liking but I would order again. Don't even get me started on the guacamole and salsa, if you don't order one of these you're doing yourself a disfavor. YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH ANY OF THESE OPTIONS. I give this place a four out of five stars because waiters/waitresses are usually slow but that would never deter me from this food. Decor, location, it's a must stop!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit, and I was impressed! Loved the chicken taco and flank steak bahn mi. Two tacos with the guacamole trio was a perfect, light and freshing meal!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent fun restaurant.  The food and drinks are incredible.  Carrie is a wonderful server.  She knows the menu like the back of her hand, and gives excellent food and drink recommendations based on your likes.  This restaurant is a must try.  After you do, you will want to go back to try something else.  They are redoing the road in front of the restaurant to include parking soon, but don't let that stop you from going there NOW!"}
{"text":"The location was a little hard to get to, but that will improve with the Front St improvements. I went here with a few friends, excited to try something new. They had a large, diverse food and drink menu and guac for days. The service was extremely slow and they forgot our guacamole until we were done with our whole meal. Great food, iffy service."}
{"text":"So we just got home after having a wonderful Sunday night meal at Crave Cantina and let me tell you what a refreshing change of pace for this area. Real authentic central America, Mexican, Latin food.  It's about damn time!!! If  you have ever traveled to Central America or Mexico you know what real latin food is. Not the Gringo crap they serve at the local Mexican restaurants. I'm talking real fresh food,  Ceviche, mojitos, Pisco sours, tuna tartare tacos, fish and shrimp tacos!  Tacos that's are not made with ground beef and mushy rice bean slop, but fresh ingredients.  I am so impressed with this place it will be our go-to from now on. Forget about the Tex- mex crap and try Crave Cantina. If you don't like it then authentic latin cuisine is just not for you and enjoy your Taco bell! Special shout out to the hostess, name escapes us, and especially Zara! She's a fantastic server helpful,smiley and full of suggestions. Buenos Noches!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and service. Selection of tacos was terrific; we loved the banh mi taco and buttermilk chicken tacos. We did not love the brisket taco (too fatty).  Tasty margarita. We tried two guacamoles; they were only okay - taste didn't pop. (At home we use more lime and salt.)"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and drinks. I'd got 1 beef brisket taco which I did not car for at all. Brisket was very dry and under seasoned. The beef taco was delicious. We also had the queso for an appetizer which was not my favorite and I wouldn't order it again. Margaritas were tasty an I love the artistic decor of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first time here . The atmosphere is very nice. Our server was a sweetheart and the menu looked awesome. Then once we ordered it all went downhill from there. The salsa trio was very watery. The trio of guacamole was way over salted and the shrimp in the guac was tiny canned salad shrimp. The yellow tail ceveche tasted like the fish was unfresh it had a foul odor. The tacos again not a great flavor and salty. We did not have a great experience and will not return."}
{"text":"Though we did not have reservations, we were seated in less than 5 minutes. Menus and water were brought to the table promptly. The waitress arrived took our drink order, returned shortly with our beverages and we ordered nacho chips and mango guacamole. FANTASTIC!  We each ordered 2 taco. Mine were a Lake Erie Walleye and a chicken tacos. My wife's were the Gringo ground beef and the marinated chicken taco.  The food was delicious and the service top notch.   We will definitely return in the near future. Great place!"}
{"text":"We showed up for dinner tonight, and just had to end up leaving without eating even though the restaurant was less than a third full.  We came up stairs and waited for someone to seat us, but nobody helped.  One server told us we could sit in a back room and as we sat down another told us we couldn't sit there.  They debated and allowed us to sit, but then nobody bothered to come back.  We ended up leaving without ever seeing a menu... sigh.  Looked good but they clearly don't care about customers."}
{"text":"Only giving this place 3 stars because they do have excellent guacamole and cocktails.   Made a reservation for 5 at 8:15 on a Friday night. We arrived around 8:10 and the table was still not ready, no big deal as we were a little early. A little after 8:15 I approach the hostess stand and check the status of our table and got a rather harsh \"still not ready\" from one of their 3 hostess. More time passes and around 8:35 I approach the stand for another check on our table. They let my friend and I know that the people who had the table prior to us would not leave and their was nothing they could do. Needless to say wonderful customer service! (Sarcasm)   If it wasn't for us being so hungry and 5 stools opening up at the bar we would have walked out and never return to this establishment. However, I will say the bartender who took care of us was nice and did everything she could to improve our experience -- HIRE MORE PEOPLE LIKE HER CRAVE CANTINA."}
{"text":"What a perfect place. Although Front Street was under construction, Crave Cantina was open. Fun atmosphere and good service. The tacos are to die for. Some of the best I've had in a long time. The queso was phenomenal as well. There are happy hour margaritas & appetizers too. Wide selection of drinks, guac, & salas too! Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants. If you're in the mood for some awesome food stop here!"}
{"text":"Crave is sooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooodddd. Ugh, just saying it makes me lean back in my chair and think about how delicious it is.   First, this place knows how to make a damn good mojito. They have a fair number of variations on the classic mojito, but the Crave Mojito, the classic style, is unlike anything I've ever had.   Second, do yourself a favor and order some Latin Poutine. The yucca fries will change your life.  The atmosphere is trendy-upscale and totally Instagram worthy, from the seating to the plating of the food. The service is also pretty impressive for how busy it is.   Parking leaves some to be desired- My boyfriend and I park closer to the Sheraton then walk- but Crave is so worth it. Be sure to make reservations because it gets super packed!"}
{"text":"Delicious salsas, especially the black bean. I had the jack fruit BBQ tacos and wasn't very impressed but overall, I would come here again - and again!"}
{"text":"Had guacamole and salsa, and tried 6 different tacos. Food all around was meh. The atmosphere is nice and our server was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch with 2 friends. We got there at noon and we're seated quickly as they had just opened. We were given waters and menus and while looking at the menus my one friend found a NICKEL in her water, she initially thought it was part of the glass. We told the waitress who seemed appalled and quickly got her a new glass. We started by ordering the large mango guacamole, the waitess said they didn't have mangos, but they could still put cheese and peppers in it...ok. When the guacamole came out, it had mangoes it...lucky us I guess! The large is super small, could definitely not feed more than 3 or 2 really hungry people, for $11 this is a joke. The tacos...were not impressive at all. I ordered the green shrimp curry taco and the chorizo taco. The green shrimp curry doesn't have shrimp in it!!! They use tiny shrimp chips!!! The chorizo looked like tiny pieces of ground up thrown away sausage that was drowned in sour cream...wtf? My friends tacos were equally unimpressive, we will not be back! If you want good tacos go to Bomba in Fairlawn!"}
{"text":"You know what is better than fresh salsa, chunky guac, and warm tortilla chips?   Tacos. Yes, that's correct. You know what's even better? Like... 20 tacos to choose from, all unique with individual components that make them incredibly delicious & wanting to order more.   I'll set the scene...   It's 6pm... I'm ravenous and Cuyahoga Falls doesn't have much good food here. It's either Shawarma Bros, Aladdin's... and then it dawned on me I haven't checked out Crave yet. Well goddammit, I am sure glad I did.   Service: great  Food: Incredible.   Get the salsa trio. It's worth it, and you can add guac. Mango/ watermelon salsa was also good, but the star was the roja salsa. Also ask for the housemade hot sauce. It's mind blowing.   The mojitos are also super tasty (I ordered the berry mojito) and not only are they insanely strong, but they're super fresh and loaded with fresh ingredients.   Also, this place is always poppin, so make a reservation online through the website, or be prepared to wait. It is 100% worth it.   I believe that I have found my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Sat for awhile before being acknowledged.   Ordered the guac to start. Avoid it. It's overpriced and extremely  underwhelming. We ordered a trio (mango, crab, corn), and they all tasted the same, similar to the wholey guacamole brand. I'm not expecting Momocho-level amazing,  but wow. This was bad.   Never asked if we wanted refills.   Never asked if we were ready to order.   Never asked how the food was.   Service was poor. Food was subpar."}
{"text":"Finally! An actual accomplishment in mod-mex food for Akron! Crave is typically not my favorite since it's relatively expensive, but with these taco prices at the Crave Cantina I can say that I'll gladly be back. Thanks for not robbing us like Nuevo does."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night and decided to eat at the bar. The bartender was extremely helpful in helping us navigate the menu (I can't eat spicy foods). The food was excellent! Fresh ingredients, wide choice of options and creative offerings.  Quaint atmosphere - just what you would expect from a restaurant like this!"}
{"text":"We really liked the food.  Tacos were great, guac was excellent, and the queso was pretty good after we figured out there was chorizo at the bottom.  However, the drinks were another story.  We ordered two mango margaritas and I made it through two sips.  It literally tasted like straight alcohol.  My boyfriend will normally try to power through a lot of bad drinks and normally will never complain at restaurants but gave up after a few sips as well.  It may have been the worst drink I've ever had, and I normally really like strong margaritas.  It seemed like the manager didn't believe us and told our server nothing could be comped.  After just getting out of the service industry, I understand you have to pay for the wasted alcohol but not even comping at 50% is a little ridiculous to me.  I would have loved to have seen anyone on staff try to drink those drinks.  I'm sure they are good when properly mixed, but I couldn't even taste the margarita mix lol at 10 dollars a pop that was more than frustrating.   I ordered a Moscow mule after that and there wasn't any lime in it, either because they really are sub par at making drinks or they were mad at us.  Either way I'll be sticking to beer if I ever come back.    We liked our server for what it is worth.  Our experience was not worth 64 dollars though.  We'll be going back to crave from now on most likely."}
{"text":"We went with a party of eight on their opening night and enjoyed everything. We started out with traditional guacamole and salsa, along with black bean salsa. All were excellent. Here's a tip on the guacamole and salsa trios- they are tiny portions like in a small ramekin. Go for a few larges of you want to share. It's worth the extra few bucks. I had two tacos- chicken and duck. The duck had goat cheese and roasted red pepper. Even with two corn tortillas, it fell apart but who cares? It was delicious! Please, if you're going to order tacos, get corn tortillas. In my opinion, flour tortillas just aren't authentic. My sons ordered Cubanos and Chivitos and split them both. Surprisingly, they both preferred the Chivitos. We paired our sandwiches and tacos with Mexi Cali corn and mac and cheese. Their sides are small and so are the prices that go with them! Had there been more, I wouldn't have been able to eat them so I think the portions were \"spot on\".  We didn't want to cheat ourselves out of desert so we did those family style, too. The bread pudding looks more like French toast since they don't cut the bread up like most places. Again, who cares?! It was crazy good! The French toast was good but probably not something I'd want to order again. My kids raved about the Choco Tacos, which were pretty dang big! I had a Cuban coffee and it was good. They roast the beans in Kent at a brewery- I forgot the name of it, sorry. Anyway, our server told me they were hoping to get an espresso machine. If you haven't had a Cuban espresso, you're missing out!   I am not sure if there were other restrooms, but the one we used was a single-use restroom, which kinda surprised me. I'm a commercial designer so I understand codes and design restrictions, but adding an extra stall would've been great, at least for the women. Speaking of design, the entire restaurant is stellar! The outdoor area, bar and large dining areas are gorgeous! Hats off to the designer(s). The lighting fixtures were pretty bad ass.   The patio will be removed when they demo the plaza (to create a new road), but it is dog friendly! When the patio is gone, they will have a roof-top patio, so I heard! They are also working on an event space in the lower level that can be rented out. I'm not in the know, just relaying what some staff members mentioned. Either way, what's not the be excited about?!"}
{"text":"Crave (the original) is one of my favorite restaurants. So when I heard about Crave Cantina, I was so excited! Who doesn't love tacos and tequila?   The night started with happy hour. The bartender was attentive, friendly, and very helpful. I got the queso, empanada, and a margarita. The queso was fabulous. And I loved that the empanadas are ala cart, per piece. The green sauce, beware. When eaten with the empanada is delightful. I took a big ol' bite of it by itself. It packs a mean punch!   The rest of my party arrived. We stayed at the bar and got a vast assortment of tacos. I personally got the ahi tuna and duck. I was very happy with with the amount of tuna. Some places like to skimp on tuna, but not Crave Cantina. The duck were also lovely.   I didn't get a chance to try any of the others that my friends got, but they looked delicious! Like the empanadas, the tacos are ala cart so you can try several kinds.   The cocktail menu is creative and fun. I'll be honest, I didn't love the 2 I got-- but purely based on personal preference. They were well executed. No big deal, I switched to a Moscow mule. ($6 for titos, which is a steal.)   I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Will definitely come back, but...   Okay, first the good things: nice atmosphere, has outdoor seating, really nice servers and management, etc. Salsas were good and so was the guac (*for the most part). Menu is a nice attempt to be creative. I will also add that I only tried two tacos and few of the salsas/guacs and had one drink. Mac and cheese was actually my favorite dish - delicious! Mexican street corn was okay. Admittedly, it's a new dish for me and may need to get used to mayo on corn. Chips were delicious, too, I should add.   The bad: don't get the crab guac. It just tasted like guac with crab poured on top of it. It wasn't subtle or \"infused\" (as I had expected). Also, nothing to really balance or enhance it. Table complained about the smell of it. Ordered the banh mi and the buttermilk chicken. I really didn't care for either one. Can't explain it, but everything sounded like it was going to be good and looked good, but it just didn't quite work out. I guess I liked the sauces on each taco (which is usually half the battle), but they felt uninspired to me... and I suspect it could be the tortillas not being homemade (and possibly not being heated up enough on the flat top)? Lastly, the margaritas: I don't like the passion fruit finish and really would've liked fresh lime juice - not a mix. It's not that I'm close-minded about new ingredients, but the finish is almost like a bad diet \"fruit\" drink. Doesn't work. I also think it makes it too sweet.   Overall, awesome service, nice environment, and creative, but okay food. I applaud them for trying (and maybe I'm just yet to get the right taco/entree). Will come back!  * Also, people complaining about hot salsa/food: grow a pair haha!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on Tuesday and it was AMAZING!!! Our waitress Carrie was PHENOMENAL! She knew everything about the menu and she was attentive and so personable! She recommended a salsa on the menu (mango, watermelon basil) and it was to die for! She's amazing, the food was amazing! Tip: make reservations just in case! The place gets packed, even through the construction! I wish I could give them a 10! The happy hour menu was amazing as well! I can't say enough about the place! It's so great! What a gem on front street!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great evening at the new Crave Cantina Front Street location. The food is AMAZING...chips and Salsa the best ever. I had the walleye taco, and a shrimp taco, absolutely the greatest tacos ever. Loved the decor, loved the friendly atmosphere, and gaga over our server Carrie, talk about feeling welcome and being taken care of, that women is so very good, makes you feel like your her new best friend, a pro to the max. Found my \"go to place\""}
{"text":"The food was good. The service left something to be desired. 2 hours for lunch is just not acceptable when you have kids. That being said this is a very nice place and I know they are fairly new and still getting the feel of things.  I look forward to their improvements over the next few months."}
{"text":"Salsa... it was good. Tacos were cold and taste ok.  Service was very slow!  I tried the baked mac and cheese... I highly do not recommend it."}
{"text":"WOW this place was amazing! My fiance and I went here after quite a long time of looking for a tasty local establishment. And this did not disappoint! Service was stellar and the food was absolutely to die for. We got the latin poutine with was so rich and bold and perfectly balanced; we also got a trio of the shrimp and crab quacs and the watermelon, mango and habanero salsa. Everything was fresh and clean tasting, the perfect start to any meal. And you can't beat gourmet tacos for $3-4 a piece! We got four of those plus two ginormous drinks and the aforementioned appetizer and guacs for $50. We left absolutely stuffed with plans to come back and bring our friends!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative stars.  I've never been to a restaurant where I literally had to gag down my bites.   I had the shrimp tacos and they smelled ridiculously fishy and were over cooked. I'm thankful that I didn't get the tuna tar-tar.  I'm sure that it would have resulted in food poisoning.   The shrimp was supposed to be green curry shrimp. Either the chef has never had curry or they were drunk. It was an amalgamation of everything terrible you could do to an Indian dish,  wherein the flavors are supposed to be nuanced and deep.   My duck taco was simply pathetic. They somehow managed to destroy a great cut of meat with so much potential. I can only say for certain that the duck confit was either not attempted or it was attempted poorly.  The sauces were thin, incredibly sweet and awful. It was like whomever designed the menu had never cooked any of the proteins or accoutrements before.  Even the sala roja was oddly sweet with no bite.   I ordered a bloody Mary that somehow was way too sugary and generally foul to taste.   Suffice to say, I didn't finish my meal. Don't go here,  people. There are much better places to get a taco in akron."}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick drink and snack.  The margaritas are great and I really like the menu.  Had the crab guacamole that was very fresh and tasty.  The staff was s friendly .  Definitely will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out on a Tuesday. Food was ready in less than 15 minutes and the hostess was very friendly.  Tried five different tacos. My favorite was the Tuna Tartare Taco that was packed with flavors that didn't just mesh together, but rather stood out individually to create an experience. My least favorite was the Vegan Chinese BBQ Jack Fruit Taco. This was my first time trying jack fruit so I may have to blame that as opposed to the taco itself. I just may not like jack fruit. I also tried the smoked brisket taco which was meh, the criollo marinated chicken taco which was good, and the buttermilk fried chicken taco which was my second favorite of the group.  I also had the Tres Queso with chips which was alright and the mexicorn which was delicious.   Overall, not a bad location and prices are average. I will definitely be back for the tuna taco and mexicorn!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Good selection of beers on tap. Guacamole is fantastic. Service has always been kinda lacking. Sit at the bar for better service and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool place to have dinner or just grab a couple drinks. The tacos are delicious (the tuna taco rocked my world) and the drinks never disappoint. (The berry mojito tastes like skittles - in a good way!) The queso with chorizo is creamy goodness.  My only complaint is the manager that was there when we were there this past Friday night. She was talking trash to her staff and it seemed like everyone was on edge because of her. I understand that a busy Friday night at a restaurant is stressful, especially if you're in charge, but there's also a way to handle your staff (and yourself) tactfully and without making everyone (including customers) feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I was there this weekend for a birthday dinner. There was a reservation for 7:30pm. The entire venue is not very large. That being said, it was moderately busy. Waitress takes our drink orders. 45 minutes later, we get our first drink. I ordered wine that was not even served in a wine glass. Most of the guests ordered beers and the few margaritas that were ordered were tasted and horrible. None of us being ones to complain we just sipped and tried to make the most of it. 3 of us ordered the queso with chorizo & gauc trio. The queso was good!! The gauc's all tasted the same for being 3 different. As we sat and waited for our entrees, (which were all just taco orders) it was nearly 9:25pm before we were served our entrees which were extremely tiny tacos. They were good but nothing to rave about. The waitress brought free chips out prior to this, not apologizing for the wait times just handed them with no salsa even as compensation. The birthday girl asked for a manager half way through this and the manager was unable to be found and never came to our table. The waitress just kind of made awkward jokes and was basically just like this is how it is. No one should wait 45 minutes for a bad margarita and not be compensated. Or wait 2 hours for tiny tacos. We didn't want a free meal by any means. Couldnt even bring us free salsa with the chips and apologize for any of this? Unfortunately will not be back and will be telling others my experience. I hope they can get things fixed."}
{"text":"I used to go to this physical location for years when it was The Firehouse, then I moved out of town. We kept in touch with our waitress, Carrie, who told us all about the new place...Crave Cantina.   The renovations look great and the food was fabulous! I saw a photo online of the Latin Cobb Salad, which was so enticing I decided to order it. Yum!  Our table also very much enjoyed the tacos, salsa trio with nacho chips and the Beer Battered Walleye Sandwich with Yucca chips.  If you haven't already tried Crave Cantina I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The Falls welcomed Latin fare to its local food scene with the recent opening of Crave Cantina, owned by the same folks who run Crave in Akron.   Their taco-centric menu features unusual combos, like a flank steak banh mi taco & a coffee barbacoa duck confit taco, & they've even got two tasty vegan options: a Nashville hot tofu taco & a Chinese BBQ jackfruit option, both of which I really like. The jackfruit can occasionally be a weird texture, so I hope they streamline the flavor on that one, but overall, a great place with great menu options. Their crab guac is amazing, too, & the chorizo arepas are the perfect appetizer to split.   Though they've got plenty of beer & margarita options, I'm thrilled to have Peruvian-inspired Pisco sours & chicha moradas just a couple miles from home."}
{"text":"In from Cincinnati visiting family, wow this place is awesome!! Packed full of flavor, food, and drinks are great! Prices are fair too."}
{"text":"Most egregious failure: the walleye taco contained a single morsel of indiscernible fried matter, approximately the size of a tater tot. Literally just a small chunk of fried batter, no fish. Trying to wrap my head around how someone could put it on the tortilla and consciously decide that it would pass as a legitimate taco. Other tacos were less of a horror story, but far cry from noteworthy. Meh. Corn tortillas seemed like the mass produced sort one would find in a chain grocery store. Granted, I live in the taco paradise that is San Diego and admittedly a bit spoiled, but come on... pay attention and serve a fish taco that comes with the fish. That's not asking for the world."}
{"text":"The guacamole trio was amazing!  Our favorite was the roasted corn and the bacon one.  We each had tacos and one was better than the other.  Favorites at the table include: tuna tartare, grilled chicken and flank steak.  We had no issues with the service.  Seated right away and drinks arrived within 5 minutes.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is like a cross between Bomba Tacos (Fairlawn) and Nuevo Modern Mexican (Akron). They offer a large selection of unique tacos (Walleye, Lamb, Vegan, Duck, Kimchi, etc), a few entrees and sandwiches, and variety of salsas and guacs. They also offer tons of tequilas and rums. Flights available.  We got a guac sample and tried the crab, sweet potato, and mango-goat cheese. All were well balanced and delicious, but I liked the sweet potato guac the best. We also tried the salsa sampler with the tomatillo (my favorite), the watermelon (very yummy...not over-the-top spicy), and the rojo (classic, thick, delicious).   I thought the shrimp taco was very good but could have used bolder flavors...maybe some more heat. I loved the duck confit taco...it was well balanced and super flavorful. My husband raved about the banh mi taco but thought the chorizo taco was meh. Our margaritas were huge and tasty. My husband ordered the Smokin Mango 'rita which definitely lived up to its name! Nothing (tacos, salsas, guac, etc.) was too overly spicy....actually I would've turned up the heat a little on everything.   One thing I didn't like was that we had to wait ten minutes to be seated, even though we made a reservation, and then another 15 minutes before I finally flagged someone down to find our waitress so we could order. After that, I never really knew who our waitress was because three different people brought us things. The food came very quickly though!"}
{"text":"Outdoor seating in a nice location. I had the Caribbean chicken skewers. The sauce was great and everybody I was with loved the yucca fries. I also liked their mango tea they had. I was happy they offered it unsweetened. My parents had the margaritas and said they were good and they didn't skimp in the tequila like other posts say. Maybe it depends on the bartender."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food!  I can't say that enough, the menu is impressive.  The effort put into a taco, that can be rather one dimensional, is felt as a ton of flair shines all the way to your plate.  Unfortunately during my multiple visits, the service has been sub-par.  Order the guac taster and you will have to wave down a server to ask for more chips so you can continue to experience the piece of art right in front of you.  Order a drink when you get there, it won't arrive for a while, and if you want another, order it when you order your food or when it comes.  If you want your check, just go to the host if you want to leave anytime soon.  Don't let this put you off to visiting the real Crave in Akron, they continue to be a rock solid place to visit in the city."}
{"text":"Tried Crave Cantina for the first time a couple weeks ago. Everything was delicious. We tried a couple different quacs, and their regular salsa, which were awesome. I ordered three dofferent tacs, chicken, fried fish and steak. The steak was super spicy but still good. Their margaritas are delish too!"}
{"text":"Aron hits another home run. Great to have another fine restaurant in summit county. Don't miss the walleye taco and empanadas."}
{"text":"It doesn't help that this place is in a construction zone, but we'll start with the waitress. She was very unattractive, left all our plates on the table, she didn't even ask if we needed anything cleared away. Then she took forever getting the check to us and then picking it up again. The food was ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"The place is very cute! The service is slllooowwwww and the food wasn't very good! I'd maybe go back for a sangria, but not to eat!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. Their napkins and silverware were pretty dirty. The waitress did not fill up our water container for us. The tacos were mediocre as well."}
{"text":"Loved this place the first time. Worth every penny. Great service, great staff, great drinks, and food to die for...I still think about that meal.  Every other time has sucked. Terrible service, multiple mistakes with no offer of correction, and food lacked flavor. Staff seemed more interested in each other than the guests. Won't waste my time again. Sad...I miss the walleye taco."}
{"text":"Kudos to the owners of Crave Cantina for starting a such a cool place in an area not known for its destination dining. The food is tasty, fresh, inventive and very reasonably priced. The decor is  warm and inviting and hip enough for any crowd. Service is finding its way but very friendly. The only drawback is how quickly it's become so popular. Make a reservation."}
{"text":"Great food. Very much the model of Bomba Taco. The food is amazing. The only thing is the service needs a little work. The bar service is beyond slow. Our server brought us the wrong guac and we offered to keep it, because we were starving by that point and they did nothing to apologize or take it off the bill. Which is fine, but not great service. Once that gets worked out...I think it will be great!"}
{"text":"My second time eating here was on Saturday and it was a horrible experience once again.  The service was so bad, our first round of drinks took 45 minutes to get to us.  Then when the margaritas came they were HORRIBLE.  One girl in our party asked to speak to a manager and mysteriously he could never be found.  There was zero compensation for waiting an absurd amount of time for our food and drinks and the bills were also all messed up.  The first time I went I had the same issues, and thought maybe it was new and they needed time.  I gave them a second chance and sadly I won't be back.  I am so disappointed as I live in the Falls but totally not worth it, I will take my money to The Office or Craft Beer Bar."}
{"text":"First off the service is excellent. The PineApple Express margarita is WOW but the berry mojito is a little too sweet.   The guacs & the salsas though ??? & Then... the Tacos?! Are AMAZING!! The Banh Mi taco is YUMMM!!!! Very comfortable.   FYI The mango/habanero/basil/mint salsa is perfectly sweet and it looks harmless but it might surprise you with a pang of heat. No regrets from me though!!! Lol"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food, definitely! Sadly, one star for the service.   We had a reservation for six last night. My husband and I showed up and were seated right away and we looked over the menu while we waited for our friends. We figured out which margaritas we wanted, and kinda glanced over the food menu. We were sitting there talking and then we realized we'd been sitting there for almost ten minutes without anyone greeting us. It took us another ten to flag down a server to ask them where our server was. She came over just as our friends were sitting down. We all got our drink orders put in and we figured out which appetizers we wanted.   The server came back with our drinks; we all ended up sharing a couple pitchers of margaritas and some sangria. All very delicious! For apps, we got queso, chicken empanadas, the poutine and crab guacamole. The guac was ON POINT. Seriously amazing.   Their list of tacos was extensive, and we each ordered a few, except our one friend who I think ordered one of every single kind except for the vegan style. Our tacos came up quickly, and the server passed out our plates. Usually when there's different styles of foods like that, they'll identify each flavor/order so you know which one you're eating. She didn't do that. This necessitated all of us examining our tacos to figure out each kind. My friend and I swapped a couple of tacos so we got the things we ordered. After examining maybe all twenty or so tacos that were on our table, my friend had not received what she ordered. Our server came by to check on our food, and my friend explained the issue. The server took her tacos away, even though one of them was correct, and asked the kitchen to fix it. Another server came over with her food and just plonked the plate down in front of her and walked away. Thankfully it was correct that time.   When our server brought our checks, all the items were on the wrong slips, but we decided it would be more trouble than it was worth to have her fix it. We just worked the cash out ourselves.   In short, food was amazing, and the service was terrible...just like their restaurant downtown. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is small, but it's packed with flavor. A simple menu of great taco choices and fantastic margaritas! Totally recommend making reservations if you go during peak times of the week. Parking is a breeze thanks to nearby parking garages, with steps to walk down to the street."}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time I have eaten there. I ate there when it first opened, and it was very average, but since they had just opened, I  figured maybe they were still working out the kinks.  My husband and I stopped after work for food and drink. It was 530, and the place was 3/4 empty, but the hostess still acted put out when we said we didn't have a reservation. We ordered a pitcher of pineapple sangria, and it was delicious. We ordered the chorizo quest which tasted like Cheez wiz with burnt sausage. The chips were stale. I got a flank steak taco and a chorizo taco. My husband got s fish sandwich. There was absolutely nothing special about any of our food. It was all very average. My husband's fish sandwich was served on a cornbread-like bun, but it had a strange after taste. I love to support local restauranrs, but this place is very average, and expensive. These two factors are why I gave it one star. Bomba in Fairlawn, which I think is a local chain, is comparatively 100 times better and less expensive."}
{"text":"First time in last night, but definitely won't be my last!  A group of about 15 of us, came in about 9:30 pm, to continue my birthday celebrations. We were extremely loud, and demanding (as a group of servers and bartenders tend to be), and our server Carrie was the absolute best!  Not only did she wait on us with a big smile, she took her time to explain the menu, offer recommendations (which were spot on), she also had no problem giving us all separate checks!  To do so, with such a great attitude is a huge deal, and I appreciated it tremendously. We all agreed, that this will be our new hang out, as long as Carrie is there and can wait on us!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch and had a very good experience. We had the bacon guac which was very flavorful. My husband had tuna and fried chicken tacos while I had chicken and flank steak. No complaints from either of us. The poutine is a five star dish. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say that the food was delicious.  My husband and I really enjoyed our tacos, and they were larger than what I've been accustomed to working and eating in Cleveland.  The buttermilk chicken and tuna tartare were the top two.   So what turned us off this place was the service.  Everyone was pleasant enough, there was just a total lack of perception and awareness about customer needs and meal timing.    We had a reservation, but walk ins were being taken.  When we checked in we were immediately taken to a tiny two person two top next to where the bus staff would drop off dirty plates and silverware.  I explained this is my birthday dinner and and would prefer not to sit there.  There were several open and clean four tops and a booth that would have allowed for a proper birthday celebration with apps, dinner, drinks and dessert. Instead, the hostess had us stand in the middle of the narrow restaurant while they cleaned off another tiny two seat table directly next to the kitchen and close enough to the other tables that diners were talking to us about our food choices.  When we left later, three of the four open tables and the booth had couples in them, not 3+ diners.  Oh, and if you wanted water?  You had to sit at a table with four seats.  No two tops had a water bottle placed on it.   Our waitress was pleasant and polite.  She took our drink order, and then we waited. And waited some more.  We had intended on ordering apps, but she never came back for that order until our drinks were served 20 minutes later.  Then she wanted us to put in apps.  Instead, we ordered guacamole and three tacos apiece.  She did give my dining partner a good recommendation. Guacamole came out shorty thereafter.  And then the tacos came about two minutes later. This wouldn't have been a problem if we had been at a table of sufficient size.    Would I go back?  Sure if I'm in the neighborhood, but I'm not going out of my way.  Did we leave early because we got tired of waiting for drinks and the table to be cleared?  Absolutely.  Dessert was done elsewhere where were seated in a nice, comfy booth and treated to special drinks for my birthday."}
{"text":"Great local modern Mexican joint just down the street. Loved the empanada appetizers and seasoned tortilla chips. They have several mixed guacamole flavors that look amazing. Sat at the bar and had great service! Will be back many times (especially once the road opens up outside!)"}
