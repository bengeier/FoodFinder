{"text":"Our table of 6 ordered a variety of milkshakes. Tasty & casual fun place to stop by in the afternoon. Very understaffed. 1 girl making milkshakes & a line up of 20-25 people at 3:00 pm on a Monday. Good idea for a place to eat but they need to get customers thru a lot more quickly. Not exceptional. Not very clean. Has potential but won't last long at this level of service."}
{"text":"We waited a pretty long time to order and even get food. But when we did the things came in different times. They mixed up one milkshake but knew the moment they served it. I had the Asiago truffle fries and they were such a blessing. My friends has the mama Mia and though one has no problem, the other has a watery burger. I'd come again for sure. If there was. 2.5 I would be this"}
{"text":"This is a 100% novelty burger n shake joint. Burgers were great. Shakes were intense. That said - probably won't be back. Way over priced for what it is."}
{"text":"Only came in for a milkshake as I had already had lunch. Burgers smelled and looked great, will definitely come back to try them, however the milkshake was very mediocre. For $8 I expect a Peters size thick shake with lots of ice cream. This one was half the size of what I was expecting and I'm not sure if there was ice cream in as it had the consistency of chocolate milk. Should have cost $3-4 for what you get. Burgers miht be good but definitely improve your shakes."}
{"text":"This place was so good, very professional staff. The portions were large, good quantity of food. You have to try the cookie, a highlight of our trip to Calgary."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the Dude Ranch Burger and it was scrumptious! The homemade bun was fresh and didnt fall apart as I ate my burger. The patty was juicy and flavorful and the toppings didnt overwhelm the beef flavor. The woman working there was very nice and gave us some free asiago fries to sample (delish!) We ordered the chocolate caramel milkshakes and they were super tasty. I would absolutely come here again and bring more friends!

In addition to the great burgers, the eco-friendly decor and recycle theme really appealed to my values. Eating beef is not exactly environmentally friendly, but their beef is raised locally and not corn-fed. I also like the fun environment and friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"Hashtag REGRUB!

For those who doesn't know what REGRUB is or who have heard of it and never been all I can say is that you're missing out! 

REGRUB is located on the middle of 11th Ave and just minutes away from The Core. Parking can be found along 11th Ave but if there's none available it is easy to find a spot around the block.

When you walk into REGRUB the first thing you'll notice is that they have an outdoor patio but when you stepped into those doors it's a whole new perspective, the layout of how the restaurant looks is not like your typical standard fast food restaurant. Seating is limited when the weather is bad other than that the patio will be open to use.

Service was quick and efficient, less then 8 minutes for my full order to come however they did come in parts which was fine. The first time the server came was to give us the Brokenheart milkshake, followed by the sweet potato fries, and finally the Bison Bison burger - all in minutes apart. All I can say is that you really have to try one for yourself to know the taste and feel of a REGRUB burger. I only wish I had ordered a second burger because I really love the one I had.

Two things that caught my eye when I was there was that the salt and pepper shakers were light bulbs which I found interesting and the second thing that caught my eye was the word \"REGRUB\" in general. I won't say much to what was interesting but if you do find out hit that \"funny\" button so myself and others who are reading this knows that you too found out about what REGRUB means.

I strongly recommend visiting REGRUB and I will for sure come back again in the near future."}
{"text":"We tried Regrub on a Tuesday evening, and it was not busy. The service was sub-par at best: the person taking our order was not pleasant and a little condescending. The seating arrangements were unclear and we were denied a spot outside on the patio. Server clearly did not have a sense of urgency as our order was waiting on the counter (which we wanted to just grab ourselves). We finally received our beverages and waters when at the end of our meal. 

The onion rings were great and the burger itself would have been quite good if the bun was warmer. The fries in the asiago fries were brown and were clearly fried in old oil- still good and edible, just not visibly appealing. Don't ever need to come back."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night. The only staff there was very friendly, but we waited for 25 minutes for 2 burgers and 2 fries. The fries was very salty and spicy and the burgers were average. The price was very high. Definitely not going back again."}
{"text":"Regrub is an oddly decorated little restaurant. Not quite sure what kind of theme they were going for but we were greeted by a pleasant man who explained that we order at the front and our food would be brought to us.
He answered all of our questions about what substitutions we could make/ what some of the ingredients were.
For starters we had the truffle Asiago fries to start. I had the black bean veggie burger and my bf  had some beef burger with lots of hot stuff on it.
I'm a disappointed that for 13-15 dollars the burgers were small and didn't come with sides. 
None the less, our fries were delicious. Crispy, salty and just the right amount of oil.
The brioche buns our burgers were served on were light and fluffy, but held all the toppings on the burger together. 
My veggie burger was obviously homemade and very tasty. My bf loved his spicy burger. I can't deny the quality despite the smaller portion sizes. 
Might be nice to try their outdoor space in the summer, as they also have a few alcoholic beverages on the menu as well."}
{"text":"1st time to regrub today with my family. And we love it.....  had the smoke n' fire and poopmoji... sooooo good.."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Had the San Jose burger and it was delicious. Plantains in a burger? Yes please.

The decor is very cool and the mural outside is a fun touch, be sure to leave a message!

Glad we made this place part of our trip to Calgary."}
{"text":"A top-notch addition to Calgary's burger scene.

I've visited twice since the restaurant opened a few days ago, and I'm extremely charmed by the menu and the atmosphere. 

The menu features a genuinely interesting and non-gimmicky collection of curated topping combinations with a vague Latin infusion. I've tried the beef and veggie patties and both a terrific -- the beef is cooked to a nice medium and is full of flavour and juice, while the veggie patty has perfect spice and consistency.

The guacamole is terrific, the Caesar salad is the better of most restaurants' side offering and everything I've tried gives the impression that the full menu must be terrific.

The staff have been friendly and attentive and when one of my party's burger came out with a missing topping they noticed almost before we did and sorted everything out with grace and alacrity.

If I had one complaint it would be the absence of a punch-card program for free burgers, because I'm going to be here a lot."}
{"text":"Legit one of the best burger places in Calgary! I recommend this a1 place! Cheers! P.s the dude ranch burger is a must try"}
{"text":"You need 90 mins if you go over lunch. 
Went to Regrub today at 11:45. Called ahead to place an order for pickup and was told they don't do that anymore. Waited outside for 30 mins and then inside for another 30. They kept telling us we need to place our order and then be seated- nobody seemed to understand our request was to order and takeout. They were actually not taking orders from people in front because was no room to seat them. Never mind that we didn't need/want to eat in. There were only 2 people working in the kitchen (obviously run off their feet), 2 on milkshakes/till and 2 running orders/cleaning up. The burger was good when I got it but the fries were cold. #nevergoingback"}
{"text":"Yep, Same as Maria! I would like to give this place 3.5 if I could. I love the concept and upcycled decor but there is room for some small improvements at Regrub.
I love that they make everything in house and the burger buns are great but our fries (though house made and delicious in flavour) looked like they were the bottom of the bag...that is they were all tiny with none of them over 3 cm in length. Sounds like a small deal but I can't stand eating 'fry crumbs'. 
The place was pretty busy for late Saturday afternoon and I think they could have used another chef as we waited for quite a while for our burgers and fries, in fact we were all done our drinks by the time our food arrived.
I think this place has potential, just a few kinks to work out but still worth a visit."}
{"text":"Food quality was okay, not a great value for the cost though. Packaging, was nice looking, but very open, food was cold despite the fast courier. 

Accuracy was bad, they had a monthly special listed that was no longer available, a server called and was extremely rude rushing us to pick something which ended up being of a lesser value, no apology was made, nor did they offer to refund the difference. Avoid this place if bad service bothers you."}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant, great servers . Fantastic milkshakes- that's what you come for ! Parking is a little crappy. But if you're downtown definitely worth the walk !"}
{"text":"It's \"burger\" spelled backwards! That alone was enough to lure me here!

Taking a stroll with my dog in the area, my sister and I were feeling a bit peckish and figured we'd get take out since there aren't really pet friendly restaurants in Calgary. 

Looking over the menu, we got the Kona classic (pickled pineapple, caramelized onion, gouda and spam), the Smoke & Fire (jalapeno cheese, pickled habanero & spicy aioli) and asiago fries and asked for it to go. Our waitress was enamored by my dog, and said we could sit and eat on the patio if we'd like - OK!

I was forewarned by my sister the burgers would be messy, and she was totally right. These are definitely multiple napkins/two handed type burgers. Your appendages will be covered in saucy cheesy goodness! 

The asiago fries were a bit overwhelming with flavor, had it been toned down a bit I might have liked them a lot more. And the Smoke & Fire burger was not shy on the heat. I would pass on this one if you're can't handle spicy food. I don't care what anyone says about spam, it's delicious and pineapple is a perfect way to tone down the saltiness.

Their tray placemats note that the burgers are handmade with love, and I seriously believe that because you can taste it! They experiment and change their menu on the regular, so keep that in mind if you're looking to try things other people (myself included) have recommended!"}
{"text":"Only giving this three stars because the milkshake was top notch. Other than that, highly disappointed. The burger was mediocre, and expensive... didn't even come with fries. Also charged a \"take out\" fee because there was no space in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped by today on what I'm guessing was a busier than usual day for them. I've come here before and had a pretty decent time, they accommodated our large group pretty well, despite their size. I like their unique and tasty burgers, but the price point is a little higher than what I think is fair...for example, $15 for a burger with no sides? Oh well. Usually the service can make up for that. 

Today, however, the service was phenomenally BAD. The inside and outside were mostly full, and when we arrived and waited for our orders, there were no clean tables to sit at. We ended up sitting at a table that wasn't bussed (and also wasn't bussed the whole time we sat there) and waited patiently for our order. Normally, I can understand when there is a wait and I don't mind waiting for my food. I DO think that it's good practice to coordinate the food so it all arrives around the same time. 

Our order was two burgers, a side of Asiago fries, and a milkshake. We ended up waiting 15 minutes for fries, then another 5 for the first burger, then 5 for the next burger, and our milkshakes were apparently forgotten about. We watched as about five or six others that came after us received theirs, and when we asked, they apologized and said that ours were next. Then the next two or three that came up were given to other tables! We had to ask again for us to finally get our milkshakes...about 45 minutes after we finished our burgers. 

Overall, Re:Grub has good food, but my experience with their service was terrible. Missed orders, slow service, and a huge mess of dirty cups was left next to the food and milkshake going out! Is that even sanitary?"}
{"text":"Mmmm...really not sure what all the hype is about, yes they make their burgers from scratch and they serve outlandish shakes and hot chocolates but the presentation far exceeds the taste. 

I had the Cheeseshake milkshake, nothing to write home about, it was sickening sweet with a load of artificial strawberry syrup mixed with vanilla ice cream, no cheese cake mixed into the actual shake as advertised. The cheesecake decoration on top left much to be desired, still frozen and stale tasting. 

My fiancé had the Krusty2.0 shake, lacked any decent flavor, quite bland overall. Again, more effort put into the presentation with the blue food colouring and mountain of candy floss on top than any real quality in the actual shake.

We also ordered the recession burger...the house made ketchup added a nice touch, as well as the fresh bun, however overall it was nothing out of this world. 

The staff were pleasant and attentive, despite the incredibly rude and obnoxiously loud tables of young adults that filled up the small space. 

Overall, I would give this place a pass...there are much better restaurants to spend your hard earned dollars and time at in this city."}
{"text":"Ok if you haven't gone here go. The milkshake was the best thing I have ever eaten in my life and the food was so good all the buns are made in house so it was so fresh and the burgers were tender they gave us Just the right amount of food which was awesome I legit ate everything which never happens I love the fries and the Cookie Monster shake is my favourite. I suggest to bring anyone here a date or your kids such a cute place to eat and drink!"}
{"text":"Okay, was an adult parent of 4 I can only give this a 2, with some caveats, my bison burger was a 5 out of 5, and village blonder was cold and good, I would come back for that. But in all honesty it's setup up for different demographics.
For example I took my 9, 11, and 13 years olds, 
9 gave it a 4 out of 5, figured it was too much, and finally couldn't finish it because his over the top sweet Krystyna shake, and mini corn dogs, my 11 old gave it a 5 out of 5, because she had the Spanish over the top cheesey burger and the niniamo shake, which she couldn't finish, my 13, which by the way suRRggested we come to this place, because she had been here with friends a month or two ago, had the grill cheese burger, which is literally a burger patty between two grill cheese sandwich looked delicious, but could only eat half, but she's a light eater of the family. Cookie monster shake, drank it all. Did I mention she's a sweet freak??? 4.5 out of 5.
And now my wife, 4 out of 5, with a ginger ale and a burger she can't remember ( so take that with a gain of salt, 4/5) LOL
It's for sweet freaks and adolescents adult or not.
Staff was good, and I'm not afraid to get up and get my own utensils and get the service I require, it's not for people that need to be waited on hand and foot.

I'll be back for the bison burger. And beer
Cheers"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on Friday night found most of the staff clueless one was extremely rude. We asked for a knife and they brought us a dirty one so I went up to ask another and he pulled 2 out looked at them obviously they were dirty put them back in the cutlery holder so I just asked for the plastic one as they were prepackaged and for sure clean. 

As for the food it is good but will not be returning."}
{"text":"The only downfall is the lame attempt at the hipster feel, the place is a dump but the food was good. They need to get rid of the plywood everywhere. It feels like a construction site with all the furniture and counters/tables they built out of particle board. A cheap route to go to save money though if you own a restaurant. Just pretend to be hipster"}
{"text":"A fun spot! The burger itself (recession buster w/ bacon) was nothing special. The workers were so kind and attentive! Also, the asiago fries live up to the hype. 10/10 would order again. So delicious. Didn't actually end up getting a milkshake, just admired from the bar as I don't have much of a sweet tooth and knew I wouldn't come close to finishing the whole thing."}
{"text":"I took my daughter to Regrub this evening in hopes of enjoying a nice meal. My daughter enjoyed her hot chocolate but only ate half of her Mac and cheese. She said it was too salty. My burger patty arrived a few minutes after her Mac and cheese. It was broken in many pieces, so I could not pick it up to eat it. I sent it back. The second burger took 20 more minutes to arrive and the patty was very thin. It was definitely not a six ounce burger as claimed... It was edible, but not impressive. The toppings were fresh and nice. There are many other places to go to get a decent burger at a better price, without the drama. The manager explained that there were new trainees in the kitchen and offered complimentary fries to compensate, but I had already eaten fries that were warm but not hot (as they should be) and did not have much flavour. We will not be returning to Regrub!"}
{"text":"Regrub has very good milkshakes however, they're hard to drink would be nice if they had more dense straws. I didn't get my drink till after my food, which I found odd considering people can choke on their food. The burger wasn't all that great meat seemed raw, not put together well enough very thin patties. Also they only give u a couple napkins. when your drinking your milkshake hands get sticky washroom is impossible wet naps would be nice."}
{"text":"Most of my stars are attributed to the Asiago Truffle Fries... oh my goodness they are soooooo goooood! As for the burgers, I definitely appreciated the eclectic choices on the menu. My sister and I ordered the Smoke n' Fire Burger (grassfed beef, smoky potato threads, jalapeno jack cheese, tomato, butter lettuce, pickled habanero, spicy aioli) and the Dude Ranch Burger (grassfed beef, bacon, sunny side up egg, cheddar cheese, tomato, butter lettuce, creamy bacon ranch sauce). I felt that the accompaniments to each of the burgers were what really gave the burgers their flavor, but as for the burger itself, to me it felt like there was something missing. Just some more seasoning needed I think. Overall still a great meal and I'll probably be back because it's close to home and a great option when you want a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"After seeing countless pictures of their crazy milkshakes, I decided to give Regrub a try. Upon reaching, there were a couple people in line, and multiple empty tables, yet we still had to wait around 15 minutes for a spot. I got a Cheeseshake, my friend got the Churro milkshake, and we got Asiago fries. The girl taking our order was very friendly and the service is top-notch.

My milkshake came quickly, however my friends order took much longer. She waited 20 minutes for her drink, and then another 25 minutes for the fries!! Kinda crazy if you ask me.

Both drinks were good, but the churro on top of one of our milkshakes was very dry, not how a churro is supposed to be at all. The fries were AMAZING though.

It's worth the hype, and it's a fun place to go for some good food!"}
{"text":"Burger was amazing, good flavour and looked really good.
Milk Shake was a milk shake nothing special with the flavour but looked super cool. Got it for the pix alone.
I felt that the place need a good cleaning. Which is crazy cuz I think its brand new. The tables were each numbers in old pop bottles. Inside the pop bottle was dirty and same with the outside. It needed to be cleaned even the flag in the bottle had crap all over it. As well as the table. My friend got stuff all over her shirt cuz she leaned forward to talk and the table had old food on it. It's truly a shame; I feel if you can't keep the front clean I don't wanna know whats happening in the kitchen. Staff needs to take more time at the end of the day and clean. I get the whole dive theme. But there is looking like a dive and just being unclean. 
Clean it up and I would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"The burgers were very good, juicy and flavourful. The fries were crisp and tasty and the staff were super friendly. We were there at the lunch time rush and after a short 10 minute wait ordered and had a table. The milkshakes are very good also."}
{"text":"We only came in for an afternoon treat since we already had lunch elsewhere. When we arrived we were told by a busser (I think that's what she was?)  to wait behind the line and when it was our turn, we would go up to the cashier to order and then we would be seated. Okay, different but they seem to have a system in place. Only thing was, there was no one in front of us and no one at the cash desk? Wasn't sure how this process would work in this instance. So we waited approx. 5 minutes and then we saw someone show up behind the counter. All in all, we ordered and told which table to sit at. This place wasn't overly busy and it's a small place so you can see they had at least half the tables empty so we were glad to be here when it wasn't busy. They do have an outdoor section in front as well however since it was raining no one was out there.

We ordered 2 shakes (The D spot and Krusty the shake) and a classic root beer float. A bit expensive for shakes but it was an after lunch treat and our first time here. 

As we waited we noticed the food getting delivered to other tables and it all looked and smelled good. They have a very small menu but for a burger place, to be expected.  We had a couple sitting at the next table to us (due note the tables are really close in this place) She had received her burger order however he didn't. She was almost finished her burger when his finally arrived. You can tell they were both a little agitated that one of them got there food and the other didn't till they were almost finished. Yes a little strange that one person would eat and the other watch? She also asked the waitress/food runner if they forgot there shakes? She mentioned they would have them soon. I thought this was strange that you wouldn't get your drinks before food, but like I said this is the first time we came here and maybe they do this? No idea. I also noticed when you order a burger, it's just a burger? No sides or anything comes with it? Very good to know. The couple ended up chatting with us and asked what we ordered since it was taking so long. We were here before they were even seated. We advised them just drinks, we didn't order food and we weren't in a hurry. They were disappointed in the food and service and truthfully I don't blame them. Which was good to know if we ever decide to come for lunch to make sure we had time since it's not a quick process.

Our two milkshakes arrived and no root beer float.  The float did arrive a few minutes after and it wasn't a huge deal since a float is quicker to drink then a shake.  The presentation of all shakes looked great (see pictures I uploaded) I did think they would be bigger however it suited us since we had just had lunch at another restaurant so don't think any of us could finish a larger milkshake or float anyway. They were good. A nice thing to try and glad we did. It's a cute little place with some creative drinks/shakes.

My review is based on my experience, not the experience that others had that we witnessed while we were there. Sure it's a bit of a wait for shakes, but I'm sure there is a reason for this? It looked like they had a fair amount of staff when we were there but maybe the shakes are time consuming to make? No idea? We weren't in a hurry and it was raining so we were fine waiting for drinks and enjoying them inside."}
{"text":"I have been here various times and love it every time! Their burger with the deep fried cheese is heavenly, their truffle fries are to die for and their milkshakes are amazing and fun. My favourite is the one with the ice cream sandwich on top!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Regrub today.  The portions were a good size for sharing and the milkshakes looked amazing.  I was disappointed when we tried the toppers on the milkshakes, both the slice of cheesecake and the donuts had a waxy taste to it.  it was kinda gross.  The milkshakes (cheesecake and Cookie Monster) were a little too sweet for my liking but was ok.  The staff were really helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"The food was good but (after discussing it) we are surprised we didn't get sick. The cook kept wiping his sweaty brow with his hand and would then continue to make the food without washing. The server/milkshake maker also mopped and then made shakes without washing as well (with their barehands). The entrance walkway was not shoveled and was a hazard. The floor was greasy and another customer actually slipped and fell. I didn't see them offer any assistance or apology. They kept mopping and fanning the floor instead, which did nothing to remove the grease. These things along with the terrible line system & seating largely outweigh how the food tastes and I will not return."}
{"text":"What burger joint runs out of buns at 645pm on a Sunday? What a waste of gas and time. Won't be going back there anytime soon. They should be prepared for busy days and make sure that they have extras of everything."}
{"text":"I love this burger place, it's unique and has character. The vegetarian burger is truly a treat! It's so filling I couldn't finish it. The sweet potato fries are truly something. The smoothies are the main attraction, ofc they're very sweet but it's worth it when you have to wait over 20-30mins to get food/seated. Their website has a live feed which is good since you can check which time of the day you can go so it won't be packed."}
{"text":"Eating here right now. Milkshake was ok, donut garnish was stale. And were still sitting waiting for an order of corndogs, about 40mins after we ordered coz they the kitchen forgot to make it. Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"The girls that were working the day of my visit were rude. That really sat the tone for our visit. The cashier was being obnoxious and was making comments about everyone in line being super rude. They were very rude about the \"assigned seating\" although there isn't a sign mentioning it.  Coming from out of town, there was no way to know that how it worked there. When we sat down the staff rudely told us to get in line even though we had been walking 15 miles around Calgary that day. We had some guests in line behind us that receive the same rude remarks about the seating and they left because they were offended. We figured we walked the entire way we might as well stay. They sat us in the long table in the center of the restaurant. There were guest occupying each side of the table so I had to crawl under the table to get to the other side. It sucked. They bring you a complementary water when you sit down but they never offer refills. If you ask, they act like you asked for their first born. Silver lining: The milkshakes came out beautiful and eye catching. They tasted kind of bland but  the picture of the milkshake was Instagram worthy. It's good to go once to see the pretty shake but no need to go back again."}
{"text":"I ended up coming back here and actually found the burger really good.  I also really enjoyed the truffle asiago fries.  The staff is also very friendly.  Will come back here for sure."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!! We ordered the Cookie Monster milkshake, which was to die for. The truffle fries and sweet potato fries were also amazing! Lastly, my burger - yum. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Also, the atmosphere is very cool and trendy! A must. Ignore the 3 star rating, they deserve much higher!"}
{"text":"Positives- relatively juicy burger so not overdone
Negatives - meat is completely bland, very oily fries and what's with the parsley?
$13 for burger without fries?"}
{"text":"My 2nd favorite burger place! They have tasty burgers and their shakes areso good too! Although I remember that they used to have this sushi burger that I've always wanted to try, but I dont think they have it anymore. The burger menu was narrowed down as well."}
{"text":"Should be renamed Regret...It was filthy in there, the staff looked uninterested in helping/serving. Someone needs to reach out to Alberta Health services! They also ran out of burger buns..What burger spot does that? Why? wHY WHY?!! They should just focus on the milkshakes, burgers are obviously not their forte."}
{"text":"Every surface you can touch in this place was sticky. The menus, tables,  ketchup bottles, the floor. Pretty gross and not a good start. Another red flag is that you have to pay (and tip)  up front. Maybe that's a good thing if service is fast? Unfortunately this wasn't the case. 

Quite clear that despite the place not being full, the kitchen staff was completely overwhelmed. Two guys cooking, and looking depressed. Severs forgot cutlery: overheard at another table who sent people looking for cutlery, \"I don't know if it's dirty or clean!\" Milkshake station seemed to be totally disorganized and confused. In general servers had a bad attitude and looked like they didn't want to be there. 

Roughly 25min to get our burgers and they forgot drinks (a coke which eventually turned up in a 2/3 full glass and a milkshake which we never ended up getting as we had to leave eventually). 

Very very expensive for what you get. The trend of overpriced burgers needs to stop. This place does it to the max. The cheapest burger is $7 which includes 4oz patty and some sparse groceries.  Next cheapest option was $10 for 6oz if you want cheese. Nothing remarkable about these. I've had better burgers at A&W. The tiny fry portion starts at $3.50 and has some ridiculous name as if they are anything other than deep fried potatoes. Of course the sides came at a different time than the burger. Right. 

Demand more, Calgary.  Don't go here. There are plenty of better burger places to choose from like Boogies or honestly even Five Guys at this rate. Skip regrub."}
{"text":"If you want a good burger, go elsewhere!

I had the smoke n fire and my friend had the dude burger. Both of us were extremely disappointed. Mine had hardly any spice. For $13 I was expecting a lot more food and better quality. For that price you can get a bigger, juicier burger with a side anywhere else. 

Service was crappy. We were asked to move twice to accommodate other diners! Oh and did I mention they could clearly see I was pregnant?? Sorry, but if I paid and I'm in the middle of eating, don't ask me to move mid meal. 

A place for very young people. At 30, I felt like the oldest person there."}
{"text":"If you like outside the box you'll love this.  Burgers,  milkshakes,  regrub is outside the box for sure."}
{"text":"My brother and I came here for lunch on NYE.  Initially we were heading to Redhead, but they were closed and then I noticed Regrub right across the street.  Since the place is on our wishlist we decided to give them a try.  I had the Bison Bison with yam fries, and my brother had the Vintage Deluxe with cheese and bacon, a side of regular fries and a milkshake.

Now I'm no burger connoisseur, but Regrub serves really tasty burgers.  The flavorful patty was juicy to the last bite (worth mentioning that it is cooked to medium and they don't tell you this, so be aware if you need yours well done).  The buttery brioche burger bun was soft yet held all of the ingredients together nicely.  The sides were your standard fare.  My brother expected a different taste for his milkshake but it was pretty good from what I tasted.

Service was friendly and efficient.  The only drawback is that a meal here can be quite pricey. I appreciate that they source their ingredients locally and make everything from scratch, but my burger and fries was $20 without a drink.  My brother's was $27 with a tip.  That's kind of steep, and no, I am not comparing to fast food burger joints.  Overall I would come back but maybe just for the burger."}
{"text":"I was very excited to bring my boyfriend here as he had never been and the last time I was here with a friend it was great. Unfortunately this visit was a bit underwhelming. We walked in and weren't acknowledged or greeted by the front staff (glad I had been there previously so I knew how ordering/seating worked, someone unaware would have probably stood there dumbfounded waiting for guidance). We grabbed menus, read and ordered our food and decided to sit outside as there was no available seats inside. Every single table outside was dirty with food/empty dishes/garbage from the last customers meals. I noticed the entire time we were there no one cleared off anything even when other people were sitting there AND ordered food. Our food comes and my fries were a bit under cooked but the burger was great. Considering we spent 40 bucks for 2 burgers, 2 fries, 1 milkshake and a Diet Coke it was kinda brutal. Probably wouldn't make the effort to go downtown here from the SE again."}
{"text":"I would've given Re:grub 4 stars if this was back when they first opened. It seemed the standards and the care for the food and the restaurant was much higher and more prominent.  Fast forward to now, and this all seems lacking.  

First, the place was dirty.  We walked in about 6pm, and there were about 3 tables filled, excluding us.  The first thing I noticed was the really greasy, and slippery floor.  All I saw were 3 or 4 people huddled behind the front counter, and immediately thought that someone could've at least scrubbed the floor while it was dead/empty.  I feel cleanliness in an establishment is one of the most important things to further a customer's experience.  Once I \"experienced\" the floor, it couldn't be helped to notice that our table was kinda sticky.  Like the accumulation of grease over time.  There was black grime at the bottom of the corrugated metal at the kitchen and I bet the shelves behind the milkshake bar have not been cleaned.  A word to the management: set a better example for your staff.

Second, the food.  We thought the food was pretty decent.  The burgers came out hot and the patties were fresh, and the buns were nice and soft.  Taste was definitely there, and the milkshake was nice and thick.  A couple of gripes was the patties fell apart pretty quick, some of the burgers were pretty messy and the Picante fries tasted like Ruffles bbq chips, except in fries form (not exactly worth the 6 dollars when you can buy a large bag of chips for $3).  

Overall, I'm giving these guys two stars.  The biggest disappointment was the cleanliness.  The other downfall was the value.  The quality and presentation of the food and drinks do not reflect the amount of money that is being charged.  I can think of several different places where I can spend 50 dollars with better food, and in a cleaner environment.  The food presentation could be better and maybe change up the paper designs on the trays occasionally so that it doesn't feel too stagnant.  The design is over a year old now."}
{"text":"Ordered TWO Cheesy Jrs + Kennebec fries + Serious rings + 2 drinks. Server brings just ONE burger. So I had to order & pay again for another Cheesy Jr. The gal was not apologetic nor did she tell the grill to prioritize our order. 15-20 min goes by, everybody else tables get their orders! Very poor service. The burger is decent tho bun seems not 100% fresh. Onion rings with maple syrup YUM."}
{"text":"Cute little burger shop. When you walk in we were greeted by the hostess who was really friendly and helpful. 

Atmosphere 5/5 - modern and cozy place. 
Service 5/5- Friendly and quick service. The front hostess she was so nice and helpful right from when we first walked in. 
Food - A order of pop for $2.5 was average price for most places but the cup was huge which was a nice. There's a good variety of burger selection with unique toppings. 

We ordered the dude ranch burger and the bison bison.  The dude ranch burger was 4/5 was good but messy to eat. The yolk broke and was a bit sloppy but it taste good. The meat patty needs a bit of seasoning it was a bit bland. The bison bison 3.5/5 it was a bit greasy but a bit bland. Needs a bit of in the meat patty. A little sauce with a kick to it would make it even better. On every plate there was a small heart shape butter cookie.....nice finish to the dinner! 

Overall a nice place to come for a good burger.  Was on the pricier side but your paying for food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great Milkshakes! I tried the Cheesecake one and it was amazing my boyfriend tried the D-Spot and it was great too! If you come here you have to try the milkshakes for sure!"}
{"text":"I am always dubious of gourmet burger places, after too many experiences of them that really left me wanting more I rarely go out to get a burger (except Harveys and Woody's in Etobicoke in Ontario!). This place is unfortunately the same. We arrived around 5ish after a good hike near Canmore and wanted to try the milkshakes and burger that our friend had raved to us while on the hike (a slight hike impairment may have also contributed to this as we were all hungry and tired). We got in line, which was growing while we got there, so be warned long lines and kids do not mix. But we were hopeful the long line ups were a good sign of the food and drink, especially the drink! We saw pretty much every patron with an elaborate and diabetic inducing milkshake, so at the cash I ordered the turkey bacon burger and a cappuccino milkshake. We sat down and waited for what seemed like at least 30min to get our food and drink. Mind you the place was swamped so I won't beat them too much on the wait, but it still sucked. We chatted briefly with the young ladies beside us as they had been there for what seemed long before we arrived, they had a burger and plate of fries and after talking with them they were waiting on their milkshakes before chowing down. I had to get up and ask for water at one point when no one came out to give us some, they came promptly after that. Then finally our burgers came out one by one, and again we had two people ask for the beers they had ordered, which came out shortly after. Our milkshakes hadn't arrived yet, so instead of waiting we ate instead. The turkey burger had a delicious sauce, lettuce, crispy bacon and some sharp cheddar cheese, although the burger itself was fairly dry, which was disappointing as my homemade burgers always end up so juicy! Finally the milkshakes arrived halfway through our burger eating, and it was a masterpiece! Big dallop of whip cream, coffee in the bottom and thick milkshake consistency. I really enjoyed it :) 
Overall, if you want the burgers maybe take your chances, otherwise the milkshakes are really the big deal and worth the wait :) Also come at quieter hours so you aren't waiting around, not sure what those hours would be but I could take a gander of probably between 2-4 and 10-11."}
{"text":"We went here on a summer weekend evening and it seemed to be packed with kids off from school hanging out at the local burger and shake joint. Patio is hip and fun, but sadly all seats were taken. I got the elk burger and my \"co-restauranter\" got the Dude Ranch. We also got two milkshakes (Oreo and I can't remember the second). Everything was pretty good, we just had trouble finishing it all. You definitely get your dollars worth. Toppings on the burgers are fresh, sauce with the sweet potato fries is tangy and fresh, and the shakes were not watered down in any way. I really liked the shakes toppings and decorative edibles! Mini Oreos, sprinkles, donuts all come as part of the shake. Additionally burgers come with what I'm assuming to be a short bread house made cookie that was quite good. 

The only cons I could think of were that they don't wipe down the tables too often so we had to ask someone to do that. Secondly, they kept bringing out our food in batches (1 burger here, fries now, second burger then). I would personally prefer the food to come out together. Lastly, this was only for the elk burger, but they didn't quite let the burger rest after grilling so it got quite watery and soggy on the bun. With those minor corrections I think Re-grub would be a prime spot in Calgary for burgers. They do grind their own meat and make their own burger buns, and you can taste the difference."}
{"text":"Would rate this place a 3.5 if I could do half stars. 

Funky looking place. Interior is very fun and different. 

You order first and sit down with a number and they bring out the food for you. 

Everything looks so good on the menu. Opted for the Eureka and Bison Bison, reg truffle fries and reg smokey caesar. Shared a peanut butter and honey milkshake. 

The Bison Bison was really juicy and super good! Everything in the burger went really well and it was so full of flavour. The Eureka was good too, but not as good. It felt like it was missing a sauce or something. 

Truffle fries were really crunchy and flavourful. Would definitely order again. 

Salad was good but not as amazing as it looked. I'll stick to the fries next time as my side. 

Milkshake was good but had the consistency of just.. Milk. It wasn't thick like I would expect a milkshake to be like. Not sure if worth $8 for milk with peanut butter and honey...

Overall, the reason for my rating is the price. The food is great and the place is cool and the guys working here were awesome but seriously... $15 for a burger? With no sides and no drink? Additional $3.5-6 for a side. Another $8 for a milkshake. Ermmmm. Are people made out of gold? How do people afford to splurge so much on.. A burger? It's a little mind blowing that a restaurant (kind of but kind of not.. Not a full on restaurant with a server) can charge so much for a burger when you can get a burger at a legit sit down restaurant with a server for the same amount of money (or less????). 

ANYWAY. If you want a great burger and you don't care how much it costs you, go here. If you go here expecting to eat a burger with a mcds budget, you are not gonna be a happy camper."}
{"text":"They need more workers!!!!!!!!!! There's 1 poor girl trying to run cash and make all the drinks and 1 server. We were here for over and hour and my partner got his burger and mine was no where to be seen. The burgers were good but overly expensive. The truffle fries were not good, very soggy. This place has potential to be good but needs better management. Overrated for sure."}
{"text":"Not that healthy but very delicious. 

The menu consists mainly of two items: Burgers and milkshakes. The prices are reasonable and their set-up is great. You order first, then they seat you. 

Burgers come with a cute cookie and range from 4oz -6oz. However, this is plenty considering all the other stuff it comes with.  

Milkshakes are very creative. Most seem to be chocolate/vanilla based with something wacky on top. It's like getting two deserts."}
{"text":"This is a really unique burger spot. The bold decoration creates a fun atmosphere, and the food stands out just as much as the decor! The digital screen over the door states the wait time until you receive your food. You order at the cash and are given a lego block tower with a number on it. When your food and drinks are ready, they are brought to you. 

There milkshakes are very neat. The base is chocolate or vanilla and they add a topping depending on your choice. The basic milkshake has whip cream on the top. I got one with an ice cream sandwich on top! And I saw one with a donut and one with cotton candy. There were many more options on the menu. The burgers were good  quality as well! And with many different options. The beef is grass fed and they make there own buns at the restaurant. 

There is room to eat outside on a patio. There is music playing on the patio and there is a big mural where people are encouraged to write what makes them happy directly on the wall."}
{"text":"bf and I decided to finally try this place after all the social media hype. not really sure what all the hype was about. I guess their food/milkshakes make a really good Instagram photo is all. the milkshakes were good, however I found the burger bland and it was so overpriced. I got the dude ranch burger and expected a lot of flavor but it was pretty disappointing. the place was cute but definitely not clean. paid 47$ for two milkshakes, one burger and an order of onion rings. Big Macs have more flavor and I could've bought like 10 for the price of our entire meal. overall pretty disappointing and out 50$"}
{"text":"We had veggievore burger, truffle fries, and cheeseshake. The burger was very bland, and missing guacamole. Fries and shakes were really great! 
Service was just okay. 
All in all, would come back again just for shakes and sides."}
{"text":"This was about my fifth time eating at Regrub (at my daughter's request), and it will be my last. Each time, the experience has been worse than the one before, which makes me wonder why I go back. The problems with this place begin the moment you walk in the door.

For those unfamiliar with the way that the process works, customers line up down length of the restaurant, order, and are then seated with a number. Employees explained this procedure in the past, but it seems that practice has now been abandoned, resulting in a mish-mash of customers that understand this and those that do not. There are individual tables on the sides and a less-desirable community table in the middle. Occasionally, a customer that understands the crummy layout will ignore the system and toss belongings at one of the individual tables before getting into line. This happened last night. We were seated at the community table at specific stools, then asked to move down shoulder-to-shoulder with other customers to make room for incoming customers. This practice of lining up customers as an afterthought at a community tavl to eat like pigs at a trough needs to stop. 

They were severely under-staffed with a total of three employees working, including the cook. Anyone can see that this place cannot function with only three employees. The staff at the front were frantically trying to juggle managing the line, milkshake-making, seating customers, dealing with complaints, helping in the kitchen, and delivering food to the tables. 

My daughter's burger was delivered a full 20 minutes before mine. The gentleman beside us at the community table, who arrived after us, received his burger before I got mine while his family of 5 had to watch him eat this meal alone. In the meantime, his young children were starving and couldn't understand why their food hadn't come out with their dad's. A second burger was delivered to us, and it was the same one that my daughter had already eaten. My burger finally came out with a cold, too small, soggy bottom bun (typical for Regrub). In an effort to make up for the ridiculous wait, the server brought out an upgraded size of fries. This would have been appreciated, but they were the wrong fries (we had ordered the asiago truffle ones). 

In observing the lone cook in the kitchen, he obviously had no idea how to manage it. This is no wonder because it is not a one-cook kitchen. My daughter has worked in an extremely busy food truck kitchen and she couldn't believe his total lack of a functional system. He had no sense of urgency whatsoever and clearly had no ability to assemble orders in any kind of organized fashion. If you're that behind on your burgers, at least get out the low-prep-time food (like fries) to get something in your hungry customers' stomachs. 

This is easily the worst dining experience I've ever had in 20 years living in the Calgary area. 

Potential customers: Read the negative reviews because they are an accurate representation of the overall Regrub experience. Forget the hype. This place does not deserve your money. 

Management: Read the negative reviews and use them as an opportunity to improve. Quit setting up your employees for failure by under-staffing the restaurant and leaving your front-facing staff holding the bag when the equally under-staffed kitchen fails them. Give everyone a well-defined role and have them stick to it instead of having them run around overwhelmed and not knowing what to do next. Get it together or you won't be flipping burgers for much longer."}
{"text":"Went there again today. My husband and I are officially addicted. Same great service and the burgers and fries were up to the same high standard as the first time. You must eat here."}
{"text":"We went the very first week. Friendly crew and owner! \"Unusual\" but delicious burgers. Every time I pass by I see they have a lot of success (long line) and I think it's well deserved but it means you mean have to wait to enjoy the food. Don't give up, it worth your patience."}
{"text":"The asiago fries, wow, the fries I've ever had, they had me wondering what they do to make them so good.  I ordered the Smoke N Fire burger, it was great, and actually spicy with great flavour.  My wife ordered the Psycho Donut shake, from a presentation point of view, it's hard to beat, it looked absolutely impressive, as far as milkshakes go, Peters has them beat."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST visit! Tried the basic Burger and was not disappointed, everything from the bun down to the burger itself was amazing. Some reviews have mentioned the price being a little high, I felt for the quality of the food it was well worth it. I hope this business is supported, so please check it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Only barely okay. I got the Vintage Burger with cheese and bacon, it was $11 and came on a stale bun, with one giant piece of white onion on it, lettuce, tomato, and a flavorless aioli. This burger desperately needs an acidic or sweet component to cut through the salt and grease. It was a lot smaller than I expected. I also got the Asiago truffle fries which were good, but the portion was tiny for $6. Service was extremely slow with one member of our party receiving their food about 20 minutes after the rest had arrived. I noticed two men in Regrub T-shirt's (so I assume employees or management) standing in the kitchen chatting while one person did the cooking for the entire kitchen. Overall, I would say this is a great place to take a picture of a gigantic milkshake creation for your social media account, but they don't have much else going for them. Over priced and not very tasty, which is super disappointing considering all the lip service they pay to the mighty burger!"}
{"text":"I'm still having a tough time accepting the fact that a unique burger and fries cost between $15 to $18. Regrub is no exception but what makes them different is the use of fresh local ingredients including grassfed beef to make upscale burgers. Better quality, higher price.

I ordered the Mama Mia which the main add-ons are tomato glaze, basil, and Provolone cheese. The basil and tomato glaze were definitely flavorful. I didn't notice the cheese as much despite the fact that it was smothered all over the patty. Maybe the taste was offset by other ingredients? The beef patty was juicy and was definitely not frozen. The brioche buns looked huge but they're really light and fluffy. Overall, it was a flavorful burger despite being small but bigger than Burger 320's.

The truffle fries were my favorite part of the meal as they were crispy and had a strong cheese smell and taste. Is that what truffles taste like 'cause that was my first time?

I see burgers as comfort food which is why I think Regrub is slightly over-priced. But this place is a good alternative for an upscale burger. At Regrub, you pay for the quality which is shown through every little detail in their burgers. Compared to Burger 320, which has a similar menu and pricing, Regrub wins by a mile. Will be back occasionally when I save enough money from my weekly allowances."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying if there was a option for no stars I would pick none. 


That being said this place is disgusting. The FDA needs to set up a meeting to look how they are running this place in the kitchen I watched my burger being made and there was cross contamination for example. They go from touching my meat then touching my bun without washing hands or wearing gloves. It taste like everything is frozen the truffle isn't even real and they charge you 12 dollars for it. The fries 100% frozen not made fresh. I had food poisoning from this place and was deadly sick. I will never go back or will I send family and friends to this place. They really need to fix everything. Like even their food is served on cafeteria trays. Paying 12 dollars for a burger at least have a decent and presentable looking plate. I saw meat produce on a cart together and the meat was sitting there for the entire time I was at the restaurant. And the Patty's were actually touching the tomatoes. 

My last rant about this place which really pissed me off is I had a question for one of their employees there and she looked me in the face and told me one second let her finish this text message and that it was important. Ummm what? Important I just paid 35$ for a damn meal pretty sure the customer is important. I had to ask someone else what her name was because they're too cheap for name tags clearly. So if you ever run into Angela and have a question and she's on her phone make sure to wait till she's done with whatever it is she's doing then she will handle your problem."}
{"text":"We finally made it down here after the milkshakes were recommended by a friend.
The milkshakes are where it's at for sure! The flavors change occassionally, so if you have your heart set on a flavor, make sure you check their online menu (which they keep up-to-date).
The milkshakes are all about the presentation. If you want to wow someone, order any shake that comes with an entire dessert on top! 
The burger choices are super creative and they use quality ingredients for sure.  My husband had the smoke and fire burger, and it was my fave. It wasn't salty as others have stated, and by the third bite the fire really starts to build! We also tried the El Bandito, which was prety good. It's not overly Mexican-tasting, and you don't really notice the mac n' cheese or the pico de gallo, but add a bit of their spicy ketchup (made in house) and it's a great burger.
This place is tiny, but place your order as you walk in and they will asign you a table so you can be sure you have somewhere to eat your food."}
{"text":"If I could give it a 3.5, I would but I guess they can have the extra 0.5 because I'm a sucker for those milkshakes! 

First of all, the ordering process is inefficient and confusing at best. The line almost always extends outside the door which is fine in the summer, but when it's cold, waiting outside for 30+ min is no fun. You line up and order (+ pay and tip) at the cash and then you are handed a number to take to your table and wait for your food to come. 

The service: Meh. It's usually slow, not often friendly, and it seems like the staff is ALWAYS frazzled. For a place that's always busy, you would think the staff would have developed a system to handle the rush but nope. I'd give the service a 2.5/5 

Burgers: Though we all know Regrub for its milkshakes, they have a big menu of burgers ranging from $7 (the small, recession buster burger) - $15. The burgers are small for the price, but the ones I've tried have been very good and filling. 
The asiago fries are also so good to order on the side, but the portion is large and they are rich so I'd definitely split them. 

Milkshakes: Who HASN'T seen a Regrub milkshake? They are definitely beautiful and you're guaranteed an awesome instagram pic when you order one. I personally like the taste as well; they're not too overwhelming but the combo of the toppings and the vanilla or chocolate shake is yum! Would definitely recommend. 

Overall, the food is good, the aesthetic is GREAT, and the service sucks. They're lucky their milkshakes are so pretty LOL.."}
{"text":"Update:
It's my third time coming here, and from this visit, I learned you need to speak to the manager to get anything done. When I complained to the staff that my milkshake was terrible and bland, the employee only took it away, no one offered to make me a better one or refund me my money. I told them that my burger had old, cold buns, and my cheese wasn't even melted, the employee just looked confused and walked away.

So I asked for the manager, explained that I always tip 15% each time (you pay before you get your food) to be polite, but always end with disappointment. The staff was only accommodating at that point, and we're very polite, even asked me how they can improve on experiences next time. 

1. You're a burger joint, make amazing burgers=melted cheese, warm, not old burger buns.

2. Shakes are supposed to be sweet, not bland, so change all your vegan shake recipes, cause they are not working. 

I really hope they turn this place around, it's nice to have a vegan cheeseburger from time to time, I just want it done right. I would've given this place 2 stars, but because the manager actually did something due to my terrible experience, I'll 3-star it."}
{"text":"Had smoke and fire burger. It was not spicy at all but rather salty... really...really...really...salty....otherwise the burger was good.

Truffle fries were really good though. 

Milkshake took...30+min... We already finished our meal and was waiting to get our milkshake...when I went up to the counter and asked about the shake, the staff told me that it's about addtional 5 to 10 min and just stared at me as if I was weird for not understanding. I asked why it's taking so long, she then proceeded to tell me that the machine was out of ice cream.

Service was pretty horrific... I would give it another try at another time to see if this is always the case"}
{"text":"I like the Quotes before i walked in on the side walk\" Boss is a title, leaders stand up for everyone\" or something like that. Plus the signs informing the customers that the beef is organic and fresh. The environment is chill and welcoming. The menu has variety, and interesting. I had the bison Bison which is UBER delicious, and the Sweet potatoe fries are a must have. i would come back any time, well once a week."}
{"text":"Regrub was awesome! The milkshakes and burgers were just as good as they look in the pictures! I had the cheesy Jr burger and the Sugar Rush milkshake! I was sad coming in thinking my brother couldn't have a milkshake but when we got there we found out they have vegan milkshakes! This place is a must go!"}
{"text":"This place is so neat!!! I love all the creative and beautiful milkshakes. I really enjoyed my burger as well. The grilled cheese burger is big enough to share as well as the milkshakes. The wait was about 10 min to place my order and about 10 min for the food to come out. The food was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had the Veggievore - the one vegetarian option on the menu, along with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were amazing!! Crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and not overly greasy such that it overpowers the taste of the actual sweet potato. The burger itself was quite good! You can definitely tell the buns are freshly baked - although I did think it was a little on the dry side. I've had quite a number of veggie burger patties in my life; this one is probably in my top 10! It's not glued together by cheese (in fact I'm not sure that there was even cheese in the burger, which was a bonus for me) and I could taste the quinoa and black beans and it had a good crisp on the outside. The burger, overall, did not dissolve into mush as veggie burgers are prone to doing. I love arugula and thought it was a great substitute for plain old lettuce. Next time I have a craving for burgers I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars for overpriced burgers that's a circumference size as buddy burger at a&w for their small size. The waiting line is long u have to PAY & TIP before u even get seated. Who in the right mind would tip a place when we haven't even tasted the food or observe how we were treated. The waitress got our food mixed up but I think they're just understaffed. The place is overall not clean. It is a busy place but if staff cannot maintain their restaurant clean or even have the time to ask how the food is going then its not that great or they should have more staff. The burgers although is small, is flavourful and fresh. The asiago fries was over seasoned it seems like the fires has been sitting there for too long because it wasn't hot and it was soggy. For the price I would never come back here unless I'm only ordering a milkshake just for the photo."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bison bison burger at lunch today. Service was fairly quick.  Burger was juicy and ingredients fresh.   Price point seems a bit high compared to value.  

Buddy ordered some fries to-go, and were suggested to get it on the way out. We were a bit confused when they brought it out before the burgers were done.  

Missed out on the fiasco gelato milkshake today as they were having refrigeration issues.  Hopefully that will be fixed up soon.  Seems like a decent selection of drinks too. 

Go visit and bring a friend. Tasty burger.  Order some sides, you still might be hungry."}
{"text":"This is a dependable spot for a good burger. We have missed the peak hours that other reviews refer to. It is a down to earth burger joint, and should be judged as such. They have an extensive menu. We have been there several times. The Asiago fries are are a sure thing! All the Burgers have been good. In the last visit , I tried their Arepa burger ( photographed ). They have options for everyone. Vegan burger to elaborate milkshakes ( which I have not tried ). I recommend Regrub, and will go again. It is as creative as a burger joint can be!"}
{"text":"Overall, Disappointing. I came here with two friends about a month ago because this place looked amazing. It's very confusing when you first walk in, there's no hostess or signage explaining whether you seat yourself or wait... or wha, so we joined the lineup of 3 people by the till. Be prepared to wait... 15 minutes of waiting later we finally moved up to the till/messy milkshake prep area and my friend asked the hostess/cashier/miserable staff member what her favorite milkshake/burger combo was and she bluntly said she's never tried any. Hm you'd think they'd have staff be familiar with the food they are selling? I ordered the Veggievore burger ($12.00) and the Cookie Monster milkshake ($7.00) My friends ordered a burger and shake each, we also shared the Capisco Tater Tots ($9.00) I hated that we had to pay and TIP before even tasting the food since I had a feeling the service was going to be below average. We opted to sit outside since all the tables were either taken or waiting to be cleaned. After waiting another 15 minutes our milkshakes arrived! They looked amazing and colorful, but upon further inspection the hipster mason jar glasses were sticky and greasy which was a turnoff but we dove into them after 100 pictures for the 'gram. My friends Krusty 2.0 was sickly sweet and there was syrup all over her glass. My $7.00 Cookie Monster was an average runny Oreo milkshake... honestly a DQ Oreo blizzard is better and the donut on top was cold and stale. Our burgers arrived soon after, no complaints about these, the buns were delicious and held their shape nicely, my quinoa patty was flavorful and satisfying. Then our Capisco Tater Tots arrived on a paper covered tray. By the time we finished our burgers the cheese was hard and the tots were soggy but we tried them anyways (with our fingers since no cutlery was provided) and my first bite was accompanied by a chunk of greasy paper from the tray - Yum! We picked at the tater tots and salvaged what we could but I definitely would not say they're worth $9.00. We spent roughly 45 minutes seated at Regrub and were not checked on once by a staff member, given no cutlery, not even offered tap water... I seriously wish I hadn't tipped when I paid. I'd MAYBE consider returning for a burger but would skip the milkshakes and head to Peters Drive in instead. It's a cool concept but they need to focus on their service and making good tasting food first and gaining Instagram fame second."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because of the design of the entry and wait area.   Before I get to telling you about the best burger I've ever had in my life I will say that you wait in line to place your order and then you're seated and you wait for your order however while waiting in line there is very little space for the waiters and waitresses to serve the people who are sitting outside.  It's very inconvenient for the people who are waiting in the line especially when it started raining and there was no where to go and everyone from inside started trying to run inside and the waiters and waitresses were trying to bring everything inside past us.  that is the only flaw I find with this business.  The burger was truly the best burger I've had in my life and I got the vintage nothing fancy just a grass fed beef burger with organic tomato onion and lettuce and whatever kind of mayonnaise special sauce they put on it.  And don't forget the sweet potato fries oh my God I ordered a regular and was regretting it as soon as I left I should have gotten a large- I got my order to go.  People that live in Calgary or passing through are so lucky that they get to go to this burger place it is so damn good and I would eat there every day if I could.  The difference in taste of the meat is definitely because it's grass fed and the ingredients are so high quality because they're organic is most likely the reason why everything tastes so good.   Best burger ever i have to stop this now because I'm going to cry."}
{"text":"Cute theme and atmosphere. Average food and terrible service. Their shakes are cute but overpriced. It's just a regular shake with toppings. We ordered the Mr. Wonka shake, Celebration  shake, truffle fries, and the cheesey burger. The fries were good and the burger was alright. I feel like this place is more of a tourist trap. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Quite a change from the previous incarnation, Blowfish Sushi. Gone are the artistic touches of Jemmie and Chef Helen, and welcome to the functional industrial look with quite a bit of whimsy.

This isn't the usual burger joint. Using grass-fed beef, and grind it themselves to their own 70-30 (brisket to fat) mix, and then very lightly seasoning only just before it hits the grill, it's quite a tasty patty to say the least. The home-made brioche buns are a perfect match as well, as it absorbs a lot of the juices without soaking clear through the bun.

I chose the burger at it's purest form, that is the Vintage Deluxe, a straight burger with no cheese, bacon and so on, with only butter lettuce, tomato and onions to garnish. It's simply a good burger with no other flavour overwhelming the beef at any time, making the task to enjoy the beef even better.

As for the atmosphere? It's fun, funky and strangely cerebral. It's better seen then described, but it does give the place a pretty cool image, though a little understated when considering how understated it appears from the road on 11th ave SW.

It's well worth a visit. Trust me."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and super friendly service! The place is super cool and the owner is really really nice!! The burgers are just delicious!! And they have exotic combinations that you'll not find anywhere else in the city... If you are into traditional burgers they also have them and they are awesome!! Absolutely nothing to complain !! I recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"I really want to give these guys 4-stars, but, I just can't. 

The milkshakes look epic. You stand there waiting for a table watching shake after shake being made. You finally order yours and sit down only to get this marvelous looking concoction that's just average. Smash Burger, Peter's, Boogie's...they all have infinitely better shakes without all the hype and without the half hour wait.

My wife and I ordered burgers and the tater tots to share. I think the idea of their burgers is great. They bake their own buns, grind their own chuck, use butter lettuce instead of iceburg. All great things. Unfortunately though it leads to more hype that leaves my expectations flat. I ordered the Eureka burger. It was good, I inhaled it. But it wasn't memorable whatsoever. My wife could only eat half of hers so I finished her cheeseburger. Again, it was good, but it was also a greasy mess that just made the bun totally soggy. The tater tots were nothing to write home about. All the ingredients were great together, but when the menu says \"smothered in marinara sauce\" I was expecting something like a poutine but with tots and tomato sauce. Most of the tots were dry and the ones covered in sauce were soggy.

We waited 29 minutes for a table on Friday night. Not a terrible wait in the grand scheme of things, but getting up there. We seemed to walk in just at the wrong time as when we were seated almost half of the tables opened up and there was no longer a line at the door.

They need signage. Do you just wait in line when you show up? Do you put your name on a list? While I was eating I saw a family of four walk in and try to go directly to a table. There were no staff around so another patron explained how the system works: You stand awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant staring at people while they try to enjoy their meals without inadvertently making them feel bad for sitting there while there's a big line out the door.

At $55 before tip for two burgers, a beer, a shake, and some tater tots, this place just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"First of all, the entire system of waiting in line instead of being seated first and then waiting is ridiculous. 

My boyfriend and I wanted to try these famous milkshakes so we endured the long line up and standing forever. We weren't too hungry so we just got fries and milkshakes. 

We got truffle fries and yam fries (both great!) and the Cookie Monster milkshake and he got the nanamo milkshake. The base of both milkshakes were pretty good but the toppings were a little bland and too much. 

Not too sure what all the hype is about but I'm not feeling it."}
{"text":"With a nice sized group of 6, we were able to try a good selection of burgers/fries/milkshakes from the menu.  

The milkshakes are super stylish looking (most of them are presented with various toppings) but it just tasted like very sweet whipped cream. It was too bad because they looked so awesome! 
I do love the way the burgers are presented - you get a pretty heart shape cookie with it! However, the burgers were a bit bland, nothing too memorable. The burgers and fries were all pricey for what you get. 

Aside from mediocre food, we also found the efficiency and service a bit lacking. My partner and I ordered our burgers at the same time but I got my burger 30 minutes before him and our milkshake came out way after our burgers! We had to ask the staff multiple times to get our milkshakes. The rest of my party also had their burgers show up at various time despite it all being under the same order. 

We probably won't come back here as there are lots of other better burger places with better service."}
{"text":"The milkshakes are super fun and delicious! All have a vanilla base with fun mix-ins.

The burgers were delicious. LOVED the homemade ranch on the Dude Ranch. The Smoke n Fire was spicy but not overly hot. Loved it! 

You can't go wrong with Cheesy - loved the brick of fried cheese on top. I wouldn't get it every time, but it was fun to try it once.

The fries are also tasty. They hand grind and make their buns daily. You can really tell the food is fresh."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Regrub (burger spelled backwards).  I walked into the most incredible smell of truffles and knew lunch was going to be top shelf!  And I wasn't disappointed.  The Eureka burger was as juicy and flavourful a burger as I've ever had.  And the Asiago truffle fries-so delicious and decadent!  The whole lot was washed down by a cold brew!  And now I'm ready to face the day again.  So get down here and eat the yumminess!  Do it!!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place to go. The outrageously delicious milkshakes are one of a kind and should not be missed. The burgers are great and the location of this tiny little retro burger joint makes it an essential stop for someone looking for something out of the way. Often comfortably busy wait times here are never outrageous."}
{"text":"Enthralled with the awesome milk shakes on social media, I dragged the family here for lunch.   What a mistake.   The service was all over the place.   They had two people making food, one doing shakes,  and a bunch of servers running around somewhat aimlessly.   We ordered two burgers, an order of fries and a milkshake.   It took excessively long to get the smallest portion of the most pretentious named fries I've ever seen.   They were polished off quickly and then our burgers arrived a long while after.    While the burgers were tasty,  they weren't anything extraordinary,  and the price was too high.    My milkshake arrived way later,  how enjoyable to be done our meal and have no beverage with it..   It was tasty and unique and I can see why this place is exploding social media,  they are definitely photo worthy,  however they should maybe just stick to milkshakes,  as that's all they can seem to manage anyways.   I will not return for food."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Food was tasty, but the patty in the clubhouse burger was a tad dry. We ordered 2 burgers (smoke n fire & the clubhouse), shared one small order of Asiago fries, one milkshake, and one rootbeer. Our bill was $53. I do love that they support local companies and farmers, and make everything from scratch. But so do a lot of restaurants these days. The atmosphere is fun but feels like a casual burger joint, not a place for an expensive lunch. I don't think I've ever paid $50 for 2 burgers anywhere else in the city. I was really excited to try this place, but the food was not worth the price they charge."}
